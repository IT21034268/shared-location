3,This idea wasn't thought out,"The idea is great. But unless the aentenna is outside with NO obstruction, it doesn't pick up a signal; which then means that you need to make sure your radio is near a window. So unless your radio is ALREADY near a window, prepare to reorganize an entire room for this stupid thing."
3,Best as a temporary solution,"The platic tank holds water and the lint is directed from the dryer via the silver tube that is included. The water collects the lint and the hot air is forced out through the holes in the collection tank. The problem with this is that if you have a small room or a room with little or no ventilation the humidity makes everything wet. This can cause dampness and mold to be a problem.The collection tank is supposed to be emptied whenever the water gets dirty. I'm not sure how dirty as it doesn't really give much info other than that.I see that only as a temporary fix. The best and safest solution is to vent your dryer to the outside of the house, but until you are able to do that, this will provide a way to vent your dryer."
1,supurr-flex lint trap,this is a piece of thin plastic. JUNK they tell u 5ft of hose...how about 3ft5inchs fully stretched. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE. I am done now..
3,It does what its intended to do,"You need to install this hanging from two screws or a two nails - but it didn't say this in the instructions. We had to ask the guy in the hardware store for this information. Also, the 3 ft hose is way to short, you need to buy a six foot hose."
5,Quick fix,"This is the perfect solution when there is no option for exterior venting. Easy to hook-up. Didn't notice any humidity issues as noted in other reviews but dryer is in the basement and have a dehumidifier running in the summer months. Works great, low maintenance and less dust in the air!!!!!!!"
5,Pleasant surprise.,"We were not expecting much from this gadget but the low price did not make it much of a risk. We had tried using stockings to catch the lint that got by the dryer lint filter. It seemed the stocking soon plugged. Air presssure then built up inside the dryer forcing air out of the dryer around the drum seal, letting lint loose in the house.This little thing seems to catch almost all the lint remaining in the exhaust. After 4 or 5 loads, it is simple to remove the top and replace the catch water. If it is a long time between loads, it is wise to check the water level and pour a little in through the louvers if needed. Though not meticulous, we like a dust/lint free home but dislike dusting. This little box helps accomodate both desires while keeping moisture/heat from the dryer inside the house.Though a good value for its price, we would pay much more for a higher quality design of the same unit."
3,It does the job,My builder installed my dryer vent improperly and as a result it takes hours to dry a load of clothes. I purchased the lint trap kit as a temporary solution to be able to dry the clothes while I get dryer vent corrected. As a temporary solution I vent the lint trap into my garage. This works fine and it now takes less than an hour to dry a load of clothes. The water tank and cover are rather flimsily made but it does the job. I would not use this for any long term solution.
1,dont buy,"Flimsy and cheap, the water was supposed to keep the lint inside but it still coated the house with a fine lint dust."
2,Blowing off steam,"I recently bought a portable dryer to use in my apartment and found this item while looking for venting options. The idea behind this is great - the execution - that's another story.The duct is flimsy and tore when trying to attach it to the dryer's vent. The lid clamps are weak and have had pieces break off. Removing the lid to the water well is almost assured of releasing the duct and I've seen stronger ties on a loaf of bread.Now with that being said, if you are trying to vent in a small space without built in ventilation - this seems to be the only game in town. The idea behind it is good, but I do wish they had put a little more effort into construction (for which I would have been willing to pay a little more for)."
4,Dryer Vent,This is just as described. Makes it so convenient since I'm renting and don't want to do any changes to the house structure. The only thing is that over time the clips may become worn out but that is really no big concern.
2,Not the highest quality,"We purchased one years ago at the local hardware store and used it for years, until it was getting ugly looking, so we decided to replace it. This one was not the quality of the previous one we had. The Trap that hold the water is kind of flimsy and the hose is very cheap - in fact, we used our old hose because of the quality."
1,Where's the scholarship?,"This is a terrible, misleading book that seems to suggest that it is a scholary attempt to understand the history of the book in Canada. In fact, it is a waste, a simple catalouge of anything and everything that was ever published. Sadly, that would include these two. Where is the scholarship? Where is the analysis? Where are the insights? That these three ""academics"" ever recieved research monies from the governement is, I beleive, cause for investigation!!! Avoid at all costs. Literally!!!!!!"
2,"Good features, bad image quality",The lens cap falls for what ever reason.Not a fast camera.IS is a joke.Great video capture with Stereo audio.Great set of cool features.Sold mine off.
1,Didn't happen,THe sale didn't go through. The seller couldn't find the CD. It was a big disappointment.
1,Don't buy a Canon,I have a Powershot S2IS and it is now pretty much useless and I'm not the only one with the problem.Evidently there was problem in the S1 model which Canon issued a recall on. But not the S2 though it is the same problem. I have to slap my battery case flap shut to just take ONE pic. Canon refuses to address the issue. It is a recurring one in multiple models I believe. They keep coming out with new versions of the same problem. I have totally sworn off Canon.
5,Simply love this camera.,I upgraded from an Powershot AS70 to this camera so the jump was quite a big one. What a wonderful camera. The shutter lag is immensely shorter. I've only had the camera for 2 weeks so don't have a lot to say except that I recommend it completely.
5,Excellent product,I love this camera and the photographs it takes. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
4,Great camera,"Great camera. This camera is simple enough for anyone to use, but has advanced features that a photographer would appreciate. I went from having a 2 megapixel aim and shoot to the the s5. This is my first dslr-like camera and I enjoy it. I had a friend teach me to use the more complicated features, and I love it more now that I know how to use it. The only thing that you could say negatively is it looks like the apeture will only stay open for 15 secs. I have been experimenting with night shots and wish it could be longer."
4,"Great camera, careful about recommended attachments","I love everything about this camera, it's ease of operation, it's great pictures, quick learning curve, everything! EXCEPT, the lense filter mount is not really standard, and requires either an additional expense for a screw mount attachment, which I will not mail order, because I don't wish to order yet another non fitting attachment. When I bought the camera (here, on Amazon), one suggestion (which I agree with) was to get the UV filter, both as filter and as a protection for the lense. The problem is that said recommended filter is a screw mount, and canon, in their greed, has a click mounted thingy, which of course does not work with most accessories not canon made. Kinda like Microsoft."
3,focus won't lock,"great looking camera and I still like it, but I'm on my third camera now (other two replaced because of bad image sensors? Canon Tech finally gave up and said ""return it""It would not lock into focus on anything without playing around for 5-6 mins..........which is not the point of a point and shoot camera.So I guess you just have to try it out before you leave the store, or if you buy it online hope you get a good one.No matter what ISO or setting the support person had me set the camera to, it would ""fish"" around and beep, but would not hols a focus point....so all the photos I shot were out of focus, even though the camera thought the were perfect.solution.........returned it for a second on..and got the same thing so it must have come from the same batch.........finally went to Circuit City in person and tested two before I found one that was consistant in focusing."
5,Great Camera,I am no expert in point and shoot cameras but this one has been great! I have had no problems with it as far as using the camera. I did mistakenly format the card (delete all the pics) without realizing it. Fortunately we had most on the computer already. I especailly like the video function on this camera. I did a lot of research before selecting this camera and have not been disappointed.
5,Awesome Camera!!,This camera is awesome... it takes wonderfully clear pictures. The 12x optical zoom is more than useful for long distance shots. I have taken several night photos in full Manual mode and got many compliments on the shots. The manuverable LCD screen is also helpful in taking angled shots and still having a clear view of the screen. This camera also has macro and supermacro mode for ultra close ups. I recommend buying this camera from Amazon... fast shipping and good product!!
4,Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom,"Excellent value. Occasionally a little slow to autofocus especially in low light. Zoom is easier to use than I believed based on other reviews. Also, if your careful you should have no problem with the battery cover. I agree the sd card should removable without opening the battery cover."
5,Amazing pictures!,"I have had my camera for about a month and a half now, and I'm totally pleased with the pictures it takes! The zoom is amazing and doesn't get as grainy as others I have used in the past. The battery life (uses 4 AA batteries) is remarkable and much better than I had expected. Has the ability to take pictures while shooting video (although you end up with a freeze frame in your video). The only thing I would like that I don't believe this camera has (if it does, I haven't found it yet) is the ability to shoot in black and white instead of just converting it afterward. The red eye reduction on the camera works like a charm! After you've taken the picture, go into the settings and watch the red eyes disappear!"
4,Great camera for the price,"The Canon S5IS is a great product and pretty much is the same as its previous version the S3S.Although it is not a small camera, the camera is easy to hold and shoot.Great picture clarity except when shooting in low light.Overall it is a great camera and worth every penny."
2,"Persistent ""Change the Batteries""","This camera was great for its first month. Then I took it to Borneo with me to do some wildlife photography. I completed around 20 photos on a new set of batteries, and the camera reported ""Change the Batteries."" So I did. The message would not go away. I tried replacing the batteries with new sets of batteries 4-5 times, all to no avail. When I later traveled to Java, the camera seemed to work normally again. My suspicion is that the humidity in Borneo was just too high for the camera (the user guide says standard operating range for humidity is 10-90), but from now on I cannot rely on this Canon S5-IS to be working when I need it. I must always carry a spare, back-up camera."
5,Awesome for the price and features,"This is a great camera for the price. It's my first camera in the S range so I don't have the same history that other reviewers have. Almost everything is 'pro' with the exception of a couple minor issues: Yes, the lens cap sucks - buy the conversion adapter (Canon's or a metal one) and add a filter and cap. I like the idea of being able to take pictures while doing video but it freezes the video frame for a second and the 'click' of the shutter is also recorded. I think there might be a way to turn that off but I have to investigate further. Otherwise, if you want a 12x zoom that can be used with 30 fps video (unusual) and a great digital camera, don't hesitate to get the S5."
4,Nice Camara,"I find this camera a good deal, it has many enhanced features that it's previous versions. The only thing that I didn't like is the lens cap, it easily pops off even if you just touch it."
2,doesn't work in Sports mode,"When it first came out, many reviews described it as cure to all ills. For mostly, P&S; and occasional camera explorer like me, this camera was a major disappointment.May be I got a defective set, I could not take a single snap in sports mode, I kept getting the message camera busy. Images in P mode were blurred.Only time I could get decent photos when the camera was in Auto, Portrait and Landscape mode but even then, Image from this camera is no where as sharp as my old 5MP fuji P&S; camera."
2,Less than Satisfied,I loved this camera when I first bought it. I liked the ease of the camera. My son does Musicals and is a singer. I could get some good shots of him on stage without using the flash. My big complaint is after 14 months of owning the camera my pictures are over exposed. Totally white. I paid 399.00 for this camera. Canon has a Loyalty program and sell me a refubished camera at a discounted price. I just don't know if I ever want another Canon. Which is kind of sad. My first camera back in the 80's was a Canon AE-1 and I loved it. I just don't think I want another Canon.Sad Mom
4,Canon PowerShot S5IS,"I love this camera. I have not developed my pictures yet, but the camera has great options. I am not disappointed with the 12x zoom vs the Olympus 18x. My only complaint so far is that the lens cap comes off way to easily, but as the lens automatically extends when the camera is powered on, I can see why it was made that way."
4,Great camera for most casual users,"I got this camera a few weeks ago and have used it in both indoor and outdoor settings. It takes great pictures, the controls are very easy to figure out but spending a few minutes with the manual is a good idea. I like the way it feels and where the position of the zoom and shutter are located. At the highest resolution, file sizes have been between 3.5 and 4.5 meg. The digital zoom is great - I used it at my son's baseball game and was able to zoom in on an outfielder and get some great shots. Redeye only works in portrait mode - not auto mode (unless I just haven't found the right setting). Flash doesn't automatically pop up when you need it but it will display an icon when you need it. That auto-pop is really the only thing I wish it had. LOVE that the lcd swings out and swivels. This is overall a GREAT camera for those who want something better than your average point and shoot but don't want to spend the $ for the SLR."
4,Awesome camera,"The only reason I didn't give this camera 5 stars is that there are so many functions available on the camera I occasionally get confused as to the best way to take a picture. Low light, should I adjust ISO, white balance, etc? However, the photos it does take look fantastic and print out beautifully."
4,Canon S5IS and PSC-75 case,"The S5IS camera is everything I expected from a Canon product. It is straight forward, easy to use and produces great pictures. Having more features than a simple ""point and shoot"" camera does introduce a bit of a learning curve which is to be expected. Like many people, I go to the instruction manual only when all else fails. The manual is good; however, memory card capabilities are not very well explained.Since most of my pictures are of travel and vacation, they end up on a CD for showing on a TV set. Wow do they look great on a new widescreen set!The PSC-75 soft case I purchased at the same time is a major disappointment. The case is too small. It closes with just the camera. With the neck strap attached to the camera and a spare memory card, it doesn't close completely and the zippers tend to creap open. Far better third-party cases that will also hold a spare set of batteries are available for about the same cost."
4,great camera,I bought camera for wife and it's a great camera and takes great pictures. She took some at my grandson's ball game and you can see the ball after he hit it leaving the bat. She wanted a slr camera tho and I wish i had of bought one. Maybe later.
5,Great Camera,"We have had this camera for a little over a month now, and we love it so far. The pictures are great, and we especially like the fact that you can take video and pictures at the same time."
5,Excited buyer,"I've done research on this product and this was about %50 dollars cheaper then purchasing this in stores, that is including shipping. Great Buy!!!"
4,Kann's camera,My daughter loves her new camera. The pictures are clear and the best part is being able to take pictures at a greater distant. The special effects also make scrap booking great.
4,good camera,The camera is great - however the lens cap is flimsy and comes off easily.It took me about a of reading to figure out how to put the camera on black and white and how to manually focus. But once I figured it out it works great.
5,Great camera that comes close to a SLR,I wanted a camera that I could adjust the settings with and had a high Optical Zoom. The pictures are beautiful and I like that I can add two lenses to this on later. Very easy to use and I love the video feautre.
1,What good is a camera that doesn't work?,"Canon is still manufacturing flawed cameras that will fail many people shortly after the warranty has expired. This has been an ongoing problem since the Powershot S1 IS, but Canon refuses to acknowledge the problem or even fix it out of warranty.The camera will not doubt get many good reviews. It has many good things going for it. Good layout and takes good pics. As long as you pay the ransom of $120 to get it fixed, with no guarantee that the problem will not return, or just spend another $400-$500 on their latest/greatest camera you will be able to keep taking these good pics.Buyer Beware!I was one of the ones burned by the manufacturing flaw!"
2,"Canon PSC-75 Deluxe Soft Case for S1 IS, S2 IS, and G6 Cameras","I am still a bit torn on this camera. First off - I HATE HATE HATE the lens cap. I have also read from other users that they are having the same issue with it popping off all the time. This is awful. I feel that cameras have come far enough that this should not even be an issue.Also, many of my issues are very blurry or hazy, BUT, my disclaimer to that is it all may be caused by user error??? I THINK I know how to use the camera, but on the offchance I don't, and I am causing these issues to occur - I am just putting that out there....(I am doubtful this is the case, but you just never know.)I am not overall very impressed or highly satisfied with this purchase."
1,Shame on Canon,"I just upgraded from a Canon S1 IS to the Canon S5 IS, and got absolutely HORRIBLE ""soft"" images from pictures taken in ""AUTO"" mode indoors at highest quality (both with and without flash) with this camera. I got FAR sharper images from my Canon S1 IS. I am shocked and terribly disappointed."
4,Canon S5 IS,"It's a nice camera. It does better at long shots than I was led to believe in other reviews. i.e Not much ""shake"". It's good in low light. The prints (from the digital) are good."
4,"A very good camera,very good,but...","This camera is wonderfull,the pictures are great,flash or options.The cap is the problem,each time it fells,on evey sudden move or even if you touch it easily it fells.All in all I am really satisfied with the camera,but it could be better.The worst thing that happened to me,was from the shop that I bought it,Circuit city,they are not serious,they send me the camera really late,and when I call to see what happened they just hung up on me.Very rood,just avoid Circuit City."
4,Great mega-zoomonly lacking a few things,"Previously we had owned a Canon Powershot G series camera. We decided to switch to the S series because of the extended zoom, image stabilization, and improved video recording. We have not upset with our choice. The S5 has handled nicely, taking great pictures and being very quick. This had been a minor drawback with our G series camera. The addition of a hotshoe is a nice bonus. Too often I need som flash fill at a greater distance than 9'.If I have one complaint it would be that I wish this camera took RAW pictures. I like to experiment in HDR photos and the RAW format would give me more control. Regardless, this is a great camera if you want a large zoom and don't expect it to fit in your pocket."
4,very good,"I love the Canon Power Shot Series S5. It's very user friendly. The color is true to live. Right after I bought it I took it with me on a 2 week trip, the only thing I didn't like is that it went through Batteries fast. I will invest in some rechargeable Batteries."
2,Good while it lasted,"The camera was great until the ""Lens Error, Restart Camera"" aka ""e18 Error"" killed the camera five months in. Canon will not fix the camera. Canon has a reliability and customer support issue, it seems. I would not recommend any Canon at this time.If you doubt that this is an issue (and obviously a couple of you do), Google ""e18 error"" for yourself. I'm not the only one."
4,cannon s 5,Great Camera my 2nd digital camera..very happy ..ADDING THE HOOD IS ALL YA NEED.....AND A STEADY HAND...
5,Canon S5 IS,"Great little camera that does so much. Like all the features with the exception of the fact that the lens cap doesn't stay on like I would like it to. Maybe it's just me. Movies are excellent and the eight megapixel pictures are easy to work with. With the four gig card I put in, I can shoot a thousand pictures and over an hour of movies.Worth the money I paid.Mike"
5,GREAT,"This was my second digital camera, and is by far my favorite. It has a Cristal clear lens, and functions flawlessly. Picture quality still impresses me. Highly recommend this over the SX10IS !!!There is a patch that enables this camera to shoot is RAW and ""high speed shutter"""
3,Dead,"I have this camera for about 6 months, it started out great, great pictures. Went to NY took over 2000 pictures and than the camera just went dead. nothing works, tried new batteries, everything. camera went back to best buy and i am lucky i got an extended warr. for four years, have not got it back yet, so I do not know what is wrong with it. But if you buy one get an ext. warr.... Will follow up when camera returns to me repaired or replaced with a new onw.... The pictures where great they all came out, I also have a 4GB extreme 3 card with it."
5,Great Camera,"I've been searching for a camera around this same price range for the past five years. I ended up selling them or giving them away to my family but finally I found one that is the best, and takes gorgeous pictures. I highly recommend it. I have it now for 2 months and so far I find absolutely no faults or weaknesses."
4,Very satisfied,"I upgraded from the S3. Most people would not need to do this but I had to have the larger screen. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a 3"" screen. New version probably on the way out with a 3"" screen DO'H! I love the fact that you can use AA batteries in this unit. I always keep spares in my camera bag. Both the S3 and S5 take excellent pictures for point and shooter like me. My friends have commented that some of my pics should be on posters and I am a complete novice for sure."
2,Do not replace your S3!!!,"If you have a Canon S3 IS, do yourself a favor and keep it. Do not replace with this one. Besides the noise problem, I've just learned that S5 does not have intervalometer. And that is just sad!I hate Canon for not warning the consumers about this!"
2,Almost good enough,"The camera had many features I wanted in a digital such as fast shooting and adjustable focus while shooting videos. But there were too many things about it that I did not like. Some of there are it was very bulky, the buttons were awkard to use and worst of all, it took too many blurry pictures. It was not packaged very well and was sliding around in the box that it was shipped in from Amazon. The $20.00 book and memory card were packaged better. That was disappointing, I would have expected Amazon to take more precautions with expensive electronics. The low review cannot be completely attributed to the camera at this time because of the poor packaging and potential damage it received while in transit."
4,Canon Lover,"I love this camera it is a very nice addition to my Rebel XSI. It has a lot of cool settings and features. What I love the most is the viewfinder screen because you can shoot with it out, you can flip the screen to snap it place and when you view pics when you turn the camera your picture turns as well very cool. The only con to this camera is the noise when using the 2.0 digital I highly recommend the converter lens to get rid of that issue but other than that I am a happy camper."
4,"Great camera, except for ...",I got this camera for my wife as an anniversary gift. So far she loves it. The only real complaint is that the battery compartment cover is very awkward.
4,Just a couple of issues,"First off let me say that I am quite satisfied with my camera. But I must add to the complaints regarding the battery compartment cover. It's awkward, difficult to open and close at times...I really hate this aspect of the camera. The other issue is the lens cap and its low quality - doesn't stay on well at all. Oh...also not fond of the ultra sensitive zoom. All in all these are not major complaints but they certainly should be addressed due to the price of this camera."
2,Dont buy the bag,"Don't buy the pop-up advertised or the ""better with"" case shown when ordering the camera. It will NOT fit, it is way too small. I clicked on in and got ripped off. The case is not even made for the S5 IS *mp camera...and it will not fit. It is a force feed rip off, and is not worth the time and effort to box and return. Just a plain rip off.The camera itself is a good camera for the price, but a little ""overloaded"" for the average shooter. If you really NEED all the features and settings it offers, buy a digital SLR. I just wanted the good optics, the stabilized zoom, and 8 megapixels."
5,5 of 5 For This camera,Bought this one as a replacement for an old 2.1Mp Sony DSC-P50.. When i took my first picture and downloaded to my iBook the images spoke by themselves.. The quality is impressive and all the features on this camera are more than excellent for average to advances photographers (without spending twice or more on a dSLR)
2,Cannon purchase,The service was excellent. Received the camera faster than I thought I would. Only problem is that the view finder is blurred so not sure what the problem is. Gonna have it checked out. Pictures do come out clear.
4,Canon camera,"I bought this camera for my husband. It's easy to use, almost intuitive. Pictures are sharp, crisp. I took it out and took tons of pictures of my flowers and they look fabulous. The only problem I have with this camera is that it's hard for me to open the battery lid and that's where the picture chip is. My husband transfers to his computer directly from the camera (software is good for this, not too difficult), but I use a multimedia USB gadget so I have to take the chip out. Once out, I can't get the battery lid closed. I do have some arthritis in my fingers, so as much as I love this camera, I probably wouldn't buy it for myself because of the difficulty of opening the little lid. If that isn't a problem for you, then I would wholeheartedly recommend this camera. Fantastic pictures, very easy to use."
5,Great Camera,It's a great camera for someone who wants a little more than a pocket size camera. It has a lot of features which at the beginning was a little overwhelming but it has a manual which is easy to follow. If you don't want to bother with all the settings the auto mode is very intuitive and helps to take a great photos first time you use it. My favorite option is the ability to extent exposure up to 15 sec which makes an awesome night picture.The other great thing is the ability to record movies with an impressive quality for a photo camera. Just have a 2 gb sd card.
4,Beware,"I moved up from the S2 IS model and it is definitely an upgrade. Both the LCD and viewfinder are improvements. The memory card in the battery compartment, which is difficult to close, is not an improvement if you use a memory card reader. The ""beware"" refers to the first downloading of photos to your computer. You are asked to ""choose one of the following etc"". Which ever choice you make that first time is it. No going back and changing your mind. The software is not programed that way. I did not read this until too late and now I'm stuck with a program that I DO NOT LIKE. It works but is much too time consuming compared to the one I used with the S2. I've complained and e-mailed Canon to see if my camera can be reprogramed but no response so far, now several weeks."
4,Excellent Camera,"I owned a Canon S3 IS and was very happy with it. I just bought the Canon S5 IS and for the most part, it is also an excellent camera. The only things that I do not like are ; 1. the memory card inside the battery compartment2. the higher ISO speeds seem much more grainythan I expected.Other than these two items, several improvements have been made."
5,Terrific Camera,"This camera has most all of the functionality of a digital SLR without the high price. I'm still learning and playing around with it but have been extremely happy with the results. Some day I would like to explore changing lenses and adding a professional flash. But for now, the current lens and flash word great. Biggest lesson is to use a tripod or stand for zoomed in shots."
2,Don't Get Near This One...,"This album is horrible! the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it's a tribute to Iron Maiden.The diffrent artists in this album completely ruined the classic Iron Maiden's tracks... The Guitars are kinda of OK, but the vocals are terrible!Do yourself a favor, & get this one only if you really want to burn your money."
4,Helpful Camera Bag,"I bought my Kodak Easy Share CX7300 on a separate web site, and soon found I needed a bag. I was not willing to spend a ridiculous amount, and this was an economical, good fitting bag. It does have some room, but I've used that to carry along money, license, keys, etc. when I planned to be taking pictures away from home. Padded well and good length of shoulder strap. Appears to be durable and should last."
3,"Nice, but big","The title of my review sums up this bag: It's nice, but it's big. It says size small, so I don't know if maybe I am missing some fine print or I got sent the wrong bag, but this bag is rather large for my very compact Kodak V530 camera. Don't get me wrong, I will still use it... I was just hoping for a more compact case. I used a gift certificate to buy this, but had I actually paid for it... I probably would be sending it back."
2,TOO BIG FOR C360 CAMERA,"If you like a large bag, this fine, but...You could easily fit four C360 Kodak Digitial cameras in the bag. Made the mistake of returning in it's original wraping to Amazon. After deducting for return postage, they credited my account around 25% of the original cost. Won't make that same mistake again. Would have been better off selling at a garage sale."
3,"Good case, but mind the size.","I bought the bag for use with my Kodak DX7440 camera. The bag is well made with adequate outside padding. The front pouch has room for the wall charger, SD cards, even a spare battery. The front pouch has elastic bands for holding a set of AA batteries. There is even a zippered webbed pouch inside the case flap for an SD card or battery. I like to carry a pen with me, and there is a pen pocket on the outside of the case.I'll probably be looking for another bag though, because the DX7440 fits too snugly for my preference. The LCD and lens are pretty much squashed against the walls of the case, and you have to push it in with more force than I prefer. My concern is that anything in the front pouch with corners could push against the wall separating it and the camera, and put force on the camera lens shutter/cover for example."
2,Bulky and Awkward,"This camera bag does a good job of protecting the camera, and carrying spare batteries and even a rechargeable battery pack charger. If you carry it with the strap on your shoulder, you will probably like this bag. If, however, you are like me and desire to carry it on the belt, it is somewhat cumbersome and awkward (i.e, too fat and bulky). Also, the snap at the bottom of the belt loop on the case comes on-done constantly. Since it is a belt loop strap, it won't fall off of you, however, it gets a bit irratating because without the snap done, the case flips back and forth as you walk too easily."
2,Not a small bag,"The item description is misleading (the ""small"" part.) I have the Kodak V530, which is a very, very small digital camera. We were expecting a camera bag that would fit the camera. The camera fits in the front pocket of the camera bag! While it is a very nice camera bag, it's way too big to stick in your pocket or your purse. One bonus is that if you are travelling and want to take the charging dock with you, the charging dock for the V530 will fit in the big compartment. If you're looking for a small bag for a small digital camera, this is not the bag for you."
1,Unsatisfied,"This is a very bulky product. Misunderstood as it is refered to as a ""small"" bag. I was hoping for something smaller and not so bulky."
3,(Small it is not),"I wish I'd paid more attention to the dimentions listed because it is by no means small. It is very good quality and holds tons, much more than I need to hold. I have not used it, and replaced it with a small Samsonite hard case that fits in my purse."
5,good value,I purchased this along with a Kodak 7440 digital camera. It holds the camera and a few other things. I didn't want to spend a lot for a bag and this fits my criteria. Good value for the money.
2,A little bulky.,I bought this camera bag because it was on sale but when I got it I discovered that it is a bit on the bulky side. It's a little larger than what I was expecting. If you don't mind toting a larger bag for you little camera than I would say buy it but if you bought your camera because it's easier to carry than I would avoid purchasing it.
5,"Good Protection for Camera, a LITTLE bulky, not a lot","This has done a wonderful job of protecting my camera and my camera is still working fine after having it for all of these years. It has room to store extra batteries and the chords to connect the camera to the computer, so I always have that stuff with me whenever I have the camera with me and that is great, because I upload my pictures to my computer pretty frequently. My Mom has a super sleek container for her camera that would definitely allow her to get hers in her purse, but I like the extra protection and having extra batteries and my chords with me more than I am bothered by the fact that it is a tad bit bulky. Most of the bulkiness is from the extra coushin. Also, comes with a strap so you can wear it over your shoulder if you want, or you can take the strap off and use it without the strap."
2,It too big for my cammera.,I own a C310 camera and this bag is too big for it. IT would be useful if characteristics referes to specific models of cameras to fit.
2,Not a wacky wobbler!,I bought the Fred Flintstone wacky wobbler for my wifes Flintstone colletion. Fred wobbles but Wilma's head wobbles if you shake it real hard! Fred's whole body wobbles as it should.
1,Great sound but terminally flawed.,"I love these speakers. They made everything I put through them sound huge but clear. Had some indie tunes pouring through them at about half-volume and then they died. Two sets died within 24 hours both after being played relatively hard but nothing which should kill a product labelled ""hardcore multimedia"". Stopped. Dead. I called EV/Telex and they informed me that they are redesigning the set up to address this issue. In other words....wait for EV's next try at least with the 4.1's."
4,I'm not Canadian--liked the book,"I've learned more North American history from Berton's books than from any other writer. War of 1812, Great Depression, and here, a portrait of the 1960's. Is it my imagination... or was this book once titled ""1967-- the Last Good Year""?? Glad they dropped that. Thinking Canada has lots of good years in its future, which I hope includes more Berton books."
5,HER POEMS CARESS...,"THE BEAUTY OF MAY SWENSON'S POEMS IS THEY NEVER GET OLD. NO MATTER THE AMOUNT OF TIMES YOU READ THEM, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING FRESH AND NEW TO DISCOVER. THE SENSUALITY IN HER WORKS IS SO STRONG, TO READ THEM IS TO FEEL CARESSED BY HER WORDS. DEFINITELY POEMS TO TAKE YOUR TIME READING BECAUSE HER USE OF WORDS AND IMAGES IS TRULY A PLEASURE TRIP FOR THE MIND."
1,Ignore reviews at your peril,"I should have read the reviews, but was in a hurry to download a recording. This recording is almost unlistenable. The singers sound like they're in an echo chamber and the orchestra sound is tinny. Stay away from this."
2,Where Was the Microphone?,"While most collectors will admit that live recordings have sonic drawbacks and require more highly tuned listening than studio recordings, here we have a case where it is almost impossible to appreciate what must have been a very fine performance of Puccini's rarely performed opera. The orchestra comes through clearly with a lack of bass which makes the sound too brash. The singers, however, sound like they were in a different theater. The greatest shame is that the role of Magda is sung by the lovely Jeannette Pilou, a grossly underrecorded artist. If there was no remastering that could be done with the original recording (and Opera d'Oro has done some marvelous remasterings!)they should have waited until a better recording could have been acquired which would show this gem of an opera in its proper light."
3,Typical Rankin,A good surreal tale of a young man's epic adventure. This novel centers around the character of Hugo Rune who plays a large role without ever appearing in person (or does he?) in the narrative. Murphy and Tuppe are delightful characters but lack the charm and witticism of Jim Pooley and John Omalley in the Brentford series. Probably not amongst the strongest of Rankin's outings but quite enjoyable nonetheless.
4,Meet Cornelius Murphy! Learn about Ultimate Truths!,"If you like Douglas Adams you'll probably like Robert Rankin because his anarchic, surreal humour matches the Hitch-Hikers style very well.Follow the hero (Cornelius Murphy) and his sidekick (Tuppe) as they search for the missing chapters of the Book Of Ultimate Truths. You'll meet an Uncanny Scot, a strange lady in a straw hat, some dubious monks and numerous other delightfully bizarre characters.The plot moves swiftly and the jokes come thick and fast with every turn of the page. I highly recommend this book, but I've only scored it 8 out of 10 due to the slightly narrow nature of the humour."
3,The Book of Ultimate Truths (Mass Market Paperback),"Unfair judgement of this item!! After a month of waiting Amazon can't ship it or the Antipope. US Rankin fans beware, this is not necessarily a proper outlet for order."
1,Amazon owes me a star.,"Lets see. Acting- Sucked, Plot-Sucked, Gore- NONE. My time would have been better spent sifting through dog vomit."
5,campy horror comedy--never tries to be serious,"This hysterical slasher makes you laugh out loud, and dedicated horror fans will even enjoy picking out some of the camera setups that are mimicking murder scenes from other films. Priscilla Barnes alone is reason to see this film--better comedy than anything she ever did on Three's Company. And teaming her with Charles Fleischer as a gay rock video director was brilliant. They steal the show. And shockingly, the murders seem really routine and standard throughout the film, but all of a sudden, at the end, we get a couple of harsh hardcore killings! To add to the fun, the guys and girls all play it up as ditsy pretty people just waiting to become victims...this one is great for party viewing."
4,Good Corny Fun!,This Movie is one of the best straight-to-video horror movies I have ever seen! I especially loved the part of having Priscialla Barnes in it! She was great in this film! The ending wasn't that shocking was sort of. The idea of this film was great! Most of the acting sucked but it was still an enjoyable film! Funny and Scary At Times! A Highly Enjoyable Film if you don't take it too seriously!
3,Watch only if a Priscilla Barnes fan,"The only reason I sat through this cute but pathetic horror movie is because I love Priscilla Barnes (Three's Company). It's basically about a rock band whose manager decides to promote the band by killing all the members, throwing in a fired crew memember who wants revenge along with her. Priscilla is that maniacal manager, and her gift for comedy really shows through - she makes a very funny killer. The rest of the time she's pretty snitty and generally not likeable, but I still enjoyed her performance. The movie itself is really, really sad and not worth sitting through unless a major Priscilla fan."
2,Wow,"Imagine Corey Haim being one of the biggest stars at one time and now he ends up playing a 10 scene/10 line character in this crappy movie. No wonder he is hitting the spike!Anyways, the movie is bad. I am not sure if it is the bad acting or the bad plot. There are a few good scenes that made me want to watch the movie further.It is very predictable. Very annoying. Very bad.Priscilla Barnes (Terry from Threes Company) plays on it, that was almsot worth watching the movie...See it anyways if you want to wate some time. Perhaps you will enjoy it."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!,Nobody who isn't actually connected with this movie could possibly think it's any good. Horribly bad acting and writing make this unwatchable.
5,Great Commentary!,"This is by far the best read on Revelation I have ever had! Praise God! I would recommend it to all. Read it with your Bible open. Dr. Johnson has done his homework and has shown how the Biblical document actually does live up to its name as an ""unveiling"". This is a MUST read for anyone wishing to further their understanding of the book. I seriously doubt that you will be able to put it down or that you will be disappointed purchasing this commentary."
5,The Packer Backer Shrine,"This to me is maybe the Packer Team Of The Ages. It doesn't get any better than these guys. The plaque is well designed, well made, has a beautiful photo, excellent protection to ensure the photo will not get damaged. The price is right also. For a serious Packer Backer(I am sort of)and especially one who does not live in the shadow of Lambeau Field...this is a must. I can pay homage anytime I want to all the Packer greats of the Lombardi era. You can't go wrong buying this item."
4,Seeing this band live is a MUST!!! The CD gets Better!,"After seeing the band for the fourth time, I feel like I really know this band. Their latest album was good when I first started listening to it. But after seeing the band live and hearing the songs live and then GOING back to the songs, you have a complete different experience!""Quality Revenge At Last"" is great song and should be a Modern Rock hit. ""It's Been A Blast"", ""Knowing When To Stop"", ""Lashing Out"" and ""Go On Drone"" are really good songs... I don't have any of their earlier week (3/4ths of the band where in the INDIE ROCK band Braid). But I'm going to take a look at it. Buy this album!!"
4,Once around.,"for me, ""loses control"" took a couple listens to fully appreciate it. that was the same for me with their first album. I think hey mercedes is the kind of band that appears to be just a simple little rock band, but if you give it more then one shot you'll notice a lot subtle things that you misse the first or even secod time around."
3,They Did Lose Control,"I couldn't tell you enough about Hey Mercedes' first album ""Everynight Fireworks"" how original and awesome it was. Then came their sophomore release ""Loses Contol"" The first track starts off just as any Hey Mercedes song should, awesome guitar riffs, inticate drumming, and killer vocals. As the cd goes on, the songs being to melt with each other creating a very trite sound. If you haven't listend to Hey Mercedes you should start with ""Everynight Fireworks.""It seems their second album, even with more money and more studio time, doesn't even begin to come close to what Hey Mercedes was."
4,Not Bad,"After quite some time of listening to this album, I was able to shrug off some of the initial things I found bothersome about it.Granted, it doesn't quite match their earlier releases, this is a pretty solid album all things considered. There aren't many stand-out tracks, save the opening ""Quality Revenge at Last."" The rest of the tracks rock pretty consistently though. In all, it's worth the cash."
2,Not what my wife expected,"I bought this bundle along with another Singstar DVD. After the first use, my wife hated it. She said that you have to sing over the top of someone else singing the lyrics and that there is a lag in your singing. So, when your singing along with a song your a word or two behind and as anyone who sings knows, that can be very distracting. She said that she would love to return it. But, as with any type of media, once it's open they will only replace it. I've never used it, but she's a karaoke Queen and I trust her judgement. SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! The only reason it got any stars, was because of the content of songs and it is a cheeper alternative than a karaoke machine."
1,You Should Really Get Driger G Then this Bump King Blade,"This Blade Sucks! I wouldn't get this blade. A Metal Masters Draciel F can beat it, And A Engine Gear Driger G Can Beat it, Kid Dragoon Can beat it, Dranzer Gigs Turbo Can beat it , P.S My Draciel F Broke The Attack Ring, And My Bro's Driger F Broke The Attack Ring"
2,IT [STINKS],MY LITTLE BROTHER BOUGHT THIS BLADE THINKING IT LOOKED COOL AND HAD AN ATTACK RING THAT WOULD BUST MY BLADES. WELL WHEN IT WAS READY TO GO I BATTLED HIM. HE LOST IN AN INSTANT. IT HAS N0 INDURANCE PERIOD. IT [STINKS] SO MUCH I BEAT HIM IN LESS THAN 7 SECONDS WITH MY WORST BLADE (WING ATTACKER).
3,Truth,"Actually, any beyblade before the crappy metal fusion will do. YOU just need to get better at beyblading, i will admit, as an expert, bump king isnt the best you could get your hands on, but put it in the right hands and people will start to bow, one by one."
4,WOAH!!!!,"I think this blade is OK. I just got it of my friend. This blade always makes a tie with my custimized blade Dranborg(dranzer attack ring, gallzy weight disk, and wolborg2 base). My opinion of the over all stats are(1-10) Attack 9 Defense 7 and Endurence 10. On my opinion this blade is cool!"
5,BEST BLADE AROUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This blade rocks.I put it on a left spin gear and it broke my statium in half. If you find it get it. Oh yeah, it also broke my friends Attack ring, weight disk, spin gear, and blade base."
2,Bump King...,"Ok. First of all, compare Bump King to Knight Dranzer and Master Driger. They are the same. They all suck, except for the base. Who ever came up with that desiogn of an attack ring has a messed up head ok. Do not buy this beyblade. You're better off with a Dragoon Storm or A Draciel."
2,GOOD BLADE MY FOOT!!!!,"I dont have this blsde but my friend does. He thought it looked cool and so did I but it stinks! He barely battled with it and the tip broke off! it became so useless he doesn""t even keep in his storage box anymore. Oh and the kid who said it broke that weight disk is definitly exasurating Bump king couldnt break anything. It may be called the King but it isn""t."
4,BumpKing ROX!,"I have a bumpking..It's not all that bad.i have 9 beyblades, and bump king is about the 3rd best.For those people who gave it bad reviews, well, I don't know what you've done to them , aunustly.Okay, it was never my best beyblade but it's wicked good.Oh yeah, I forgot to say that i just battled it 10 times and it won 8 matches.LET IT RRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I often wondered about Bill Chambers...,"Whenever the Dead Ringer Band came to town I was there. What a great family group, they were always better than good. Bill's daughter Kasey was 'discovered' and Bill seemed suddenly to be everywhere, playing with other musicians, doing gigs on his own - wow - excellent guitar, great lap steel and an amazingly gruff growly voice just like country music singers used to sound. And can he write songs! Oh yes. Sleeping With The Blues is one mighty fine album. You can put it in your player and each time you listen it gets better then before - ask me to pick a favourite song and I couldn't. A pleasure to play from go to whoa. Easy to see where Kasey got her talent."
4,Paddy's Lament,"The subject of this book is heartbreaking. If it is accurate it is no wonder, to an outsider, why the Irish have such a hatred for the British. I wish I had read this book before I visited Ireland in early June. My visits included Belfast and Derry and they would have been much more meaningful."
3,Good things,"This is the latest soft rock outfit from Melbourne, Australia. Like other bands such as Coldplay and Turin Brakes, they have been championed by Nic Harcourt and his ""mornings become eclectic"" radio shows on KCRW. Gersey is definitely come down music after the party and too much drugs. It's music to relax to and wonder why you are wide awake at 6am after three days of no sleep. They blend angular guitars and sensible melodies. Most of their songs are about desire and escaping to foreign lands. The best song here is probably ""Trouble With Jonah"" which is like a minimalist Badly Drawn Boy having coffee with Julee Cruise. Gersey are much like Damien Rice: they are dying to plant a flag in America. Why this is, who knows? The earlier record, Hope Springs, is probably better though much the same. Most people are just drunk off their ass and are wearing baseball caps and waiting to smoke a joint with the next Liars release. All the best of luck to Gersey for their delicate balance."
4,Pretty Damn Good,"Gehenna are not as well known as some of their Norwegian counterparts. Murder is more of a thrash album than WW and some of their earlier stuff. It has some really killer songs on it though. The Crucified One is a seriously great song with a punishing riff that will make you go whoahhh! The recording is kind of funky though. I don't know if the recording level was set too low when it was mastered but I have to crank it way up to hear it decently. It is worth buying for sure but It is not a fave when it comes to what Norway puts out. Taake's ""Doedskvad"" and Bjoergvin"" will make you drop this c.d. in a heartbeat. It's good but not significantlly great."
3,A strong effort with professional violence,"Careerists Gehenna decided to take one further twist in their strange history and to release a mostly death metal album infused with the sonorous and engaging melodies of previous works in shorter form. Stripped down and then re-interpreted to add complexity, songs are less impact-oriented than maintainers of a consistently disturbed atmosphere. Especially relevant to fans of Belphegor's first album."
5,"A must for scientists, biologists, and enthusiasts!","This book was superb. It is written so that any reader could understand and follow yet is interesting and accurate so the professional can enjoy and not lose interest. A truly great read, anyone who is remotely interested in animals will enjoy this book."
3,"Easy going style, organization & science explanations suffer","A well-travelled science writer with an enjoyable style discusses various types of animal communication, from vocalizations to pheramones. Unfortunately the light-hearted writing sometimes gets in the way of presenting interesting information. (But there's some great stuff about the sex lives of dolphins in chapter nine.) If you usually find science books too dry or are interested in animals, give this a try."
5,a great ride around the world,"This science book, disguised as a nature travelogue, is a great ride, not to mention engaging and delightfully accessible. You start in the Amazon forest and end up on some of the world's most exotic islands. Along the way, you learn what you have in common with songbirds, glowing bacteria, orcas, and more, and remember why you feel so close to animals. You'll learn Darwinian biology without breaking a sweat. And you'll never again think you can deceive your loved ones by holding your tongue."
4,Great Beginner Bingo,"I bought this game for my 2 1/2 year-old daughter. It is a great first game for a toddler. The game can be played using pictures or words-one side of the smaller game cards has pictures, the other side has the word. This will allow the game to grow with her and will be a fun way to begin introducing sight words. She is also learning to take turns, an important skill to have once she begins preschool. It comes with four different game cards with completely different pictures/words so there is also variety. The materials are thick cardboard so it's durable, as is the box it comes in. My toddler is very busy and easily distracted (aren't they all), but she loves to play this game over and over. Overall great game!"
4,Swatch Red Storm,"The item looked to be in good condition. There was a part of the watch band that was not attached, which could have been taped temporarily to where it should go as no instructions for its assembly were included."
1,"Enclosed directions ""NOT ENCLOSED""","Enclosed directions, with detailed instructions are ""NOT ENCLOSED"". Not for this one or any of the other 4 I bought at same time. I am disappointed after spending close to $50.00 for 5 items, (different sizes), and I don't know how to use it. Guess I need to guess!"
5,Great Buy!,"I got this for my wife's 37th birthday and she loved it, it's on display in our home still today."
5,"Great addition, but need additional track for real play","First, the elevator has a cute low ding, and brio people fit in really nicely. The concept is easy, and my son liked to play with loading people at the station etc. soon after 21 months old. Its very cute and durable.There is not enough place for both a train and a car on the platform with only this piece. I actually have this as part of the track and stack city set. So, similar to the set, you will need at least one additional stacking track support and piece of straight track to build a longer raised platform for your entire train. If you set it up like in the picture, the train will run away down the slope before you can load your passenger. That set BTW is also a great addition/ basic starter train set."
1,cheap remake of a chaka khan song,kwame sampled this so did mary j blige but still I hated all their versions I prefer the original version by rufus.
4,Hmm good!,"This time out, Susan Weinert has mellowed some since her fiery Crunch Time 1994 release. The excellent guitar playing is still everywhere but things are toned down a few notches leaning more towards straight up jazz with less crunchy-edged fusion. Even keyswoman extraordinaire, Rachel Z, chimes in with ivory clean runs and flourishes to augment Weinert's electric guitars and guitar-synth. Again that Scott Henderson aura is predominantly present but a certain Frank Gambale lilt and warmth of presence and tone is recurrent. This release is an 11 song delight, track to track, with surprise after surprise of mellow wonder. For those of you out there looking for great jazz guitar and splendid keys but want less screaming amps yet able to groove too -- The Bottom Line is just right for you. Recommended! ~ John W. Patterson, EER-MUSIC.com"
2,You Dont Know...how great this song can be...,"...unless you listen to, among others, Ray Charles' great rendition.This Wilson-Giraud version has a nice arrangement but is kind of a Lite version."
4,Teen Titans are a Go!,"Second season of the hit show with the hit song! Love it! Love the action, the humor and Starfire!"
4,Good and Timely,I received my order rather quickly. The DVD was in good condition. I would buy again from this vendor!
4,Funny and great to watch again.,"If you've seen the show before, you'll know what to expect. All the episodes are in good quality, and the menus are stylish as well as simple to navigate. Probably my only let-down is the extras. Just some ads for other shows as well as a sort of look-back sketch with the Titans from Season 1 through the end of Season 2."
4,titans go!!!!,"The second season of teen titans is one of my favorites,the action really gos full swing with the introduction of terra,a loner who meets the rest of the titans,but can't control her powers. Beast Boy falls heads over heels 4 her and after finding out she has no where 2 go,she is invited 2 stay at titans tower. But slade has been watching her and wants 2 train her 2 control her powers so she can fight by his side and become his next apprentice. The season is action packed with twist and turns that test friendship and duty that can make or break the teen titans forever!! A great season to a great series!! A must have!!!"
3,A bit disappointing,"I found this book a bit disappointing. Although it does provide some additional information on ODBC and SQL, it still felt like I was reading the Filemaker User's Guide all over again. There are a few scripting, calculation, and data transfer examples, but not enough. From the title ""Automating Filemaker"" I implied that the book would mostly focus on scripting and calculations. Not so. Too much of the book focuses on the basics of Filemaker (again, this info can be obtained from the User's Guide). A great overall book, but not for the serious developer."
2,a wast of papper,"The book rambles on about all that file maker does, but he does tellyou how to do it, or to apply it. No examples set up some programs. I do think what is on the CD more usefull."
1,"Bad, shamefull and a very [costly] partly replacement","It just doubles a part of the userguide, in a shallow manner. I paid for that one already. Besides this: too big font, too less words, too much pages.I learned that I better read what other buyers have experienced. I will do so and my advice to you: stay away from this one."
4,feet hugging,these shoes are feet hugging and soft. there is no slipping of my feet like similar cutsof other brands. I am pleased with my purchase.
2,Cute shoe but very snug,"This shoe is very cute, but I believe it was an older style Clarks sandal, and it ran small. Although I own many Clarks sandals in the same size, this one was so snug, I had to return it."
3,If you like the genre. . .,". . .of the political novel, then you probably ought to invest some time into this fairly well-done example.While the book only deserves three stars (minus one for quality and minus another for its datedness) it does explore moral questions involved during the Cold War; thougt-provoking questions about the balance between national security and freedom of the press; and an interesting scenario involving the Constitutional ramifications of a President ""missing and presumed dead"" where the details remain unclear at best.Three stars."
5,A Great Book!,"I bought this book on vacation many years ago. I spent most of my vacation reading 0 I could not put it down - and now, many years later, it still has that fascination for me. Highly recommended - if you can find a copy!"
4,A rare resource,"This is one of the few books I've been able find that focuses on Indigo adults rather than Indigo children. It is very thought-provoking, and consoling for those Indigo adults who have felt isolated from their everyday peers. The book is taken from a seminar-delivery in Germany, but is well-transposed from a speech into prose; you do not get the sense that you are reading a script until you reach the question-and-answer period at the end of each chapter -- but even those sections are handled well by the editors. It's a very valuable starting point for those who sense they are Indigo adults and would like some direction on where to go and what to do next."
3,Indigo - no answers,Interesting book with a few cool ideas but never arrives at any kind of conclusion like: where now and how do I deal with this gift accordingly. It's just a Indigo Groupie book that goes nowhere.
1,A waste of money and time.,"I bought it and read it all. The author has good points and ideas. However, it's vague and not well written. The book is not worth the price and it's short too. I think the author should not write anymore or find another style that flows and is more factual. There are many odd thoughts that one may wonder if the writer is insane or takes something while writing. I think there are amny other gifted true writers out there. If you want information DO NOT get this book. You'll regret it. If you do you'll see for yourself."
1,Indigo Adults,"The only good thing I can say is that the book is structured well. I am on the spiritual path, and this book is obviously written by people who are not on the path. These people are about making money, being accepted by society, and defending your ego. Being indigo is about being up to the challenge of mastering your life mission to raise the vibrations of yourself and the earth, while this book will teach you how to be a corporate success."
5,Update from the Author,"Dear All, We've been very touched by how well you have responded to the book, and we're glad it has brought such value to you. We originally self-published, and now CareerPress, a mainstream publisher has picked up the book and is reissuing Indigo Adults along with a new chapter entitled ""Indigo's in Love"" which addresses some of the dynamics that Indigo's experience in relationship. This current version won't be available any longer. We're also bringing the Indigo Adult programs to the USA. Check our site at www.essencetraining.com for details. Thanks, KabirHere's the link for the new version:Indigo Adults: Understanding Who You Are and What You Can Become"
4,History Plus,"This collection of essays contains all of Danto's now out-of-print Analytical Philosophy of History, plus a handful of other pieces. If you are interested in the methods and objectives of historical study, or in the kind of knowledge history may produce, you should read this book."
3,You can't always get what you want...,"...Like good detail with the video.But you might find that you get what you need.Like step by step how to assemble from a parts kit.922(r) issues.And a pretty good rundown of bending a flat.If you can't find a better video, this one will do just fine."
3,I didn't finish it.,"So, why did I give it three stars? The author writes well and others may really enjoy the book. My problem with the book was that half way through, it was just as depressing as it was on page one. Tiajuana is totally corrupt. Virtually everyone associated with Tiajuana is totally corrupt regardless of profession including the main character. His only redeeming value appears to be a bit of human kindness, which redeeming value is not shared by the other characters.For all I know the book presents a very real picture of Tiajuana, but I read for entertainment and enjoyment. Even though well written, I found nothing very entertaining or enjoyable about this book. So, after about half the book, I put it down."
3,A good idea but mediocre execution,"This was a story which had its moments for me but overall the quality of the writing was just too uneven for my taste. The characters were adequately fleshed out, and the sense of place was nicely drawn but the dialogue was often stilted and the action ragged and even sometimes barely comprehensible. I gave it 3 stars for the idea and the promise but lack of fruitful execution."
5,Time well-spent!,"Dia de Los Muertos was the first of Kent Harrington's books that I've read. Not my usual choice, but I was really surprised how much I liked it. From the moment I started, I couldn't put it down. A very gritty locale and not some pretty despicable characters, as well. But the story's main character had an inner goodness that made you root for things to go well. Would absolutely recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining read."
4,Vicious black humor,"I never forgot Kent Harrington's Dark Ride after I read it. I wondered for years what he had done next, because his work was not easy to find in the bookstores. Thanks to the Kindle, I have been able to enjoy more. What I like about the Harrington style is the combination of truly unsettling, often harrowing situations that still contain a pronounced vein of black humor. I'm now in the middle of Red Jungle, which is something of a departure, but still bears the same stamp."
4,What will happen When Midnight Comes?,"I really like this book! I try to read it every March...the misty month of March when bad things tend to happen.""March is the month my mother was really afraid of,"" John Steinbeck wrote in Journal of a Novel. ""She practically held her breath until it was over every year. For everything bad happened to our family in March.""Mrs. Bridgeport ""hated March. Neither winter nor spring ... a dreary time of cruel winds and cold rains and dark afternoons.""When highschool-drop-out cousin Wilma comes to visit, things just seem to go wrong at the Bridgeport home. Is Wilma lurking through the house while no one is around? What is she doing in eldest child, Joan's room while she is in school? Is she trying to scare the children? Is she the cause of the bad things that have been happening? Or is it something else?Enjoy the Book!"
2,Short But Dull,"Mrs. Madeleine Bridgeport and her three children have perfect lives--they're rich, attractive, bright, and energetic. But all of that changes when Mrs. Bridgeport's homely, lifeless niece (Wilma) comes to visit for a couple weeks and has a contagious effect on everyone. At first, you want to feel sorry for Wilma, but after a while of her lethargy, even the reader feels dulled by her. The one good thing about this book, though, is that it's short (128 pages). Yet it still took me a bit longer than I had expected to finish it. The ending isn't very satisfying either, but at least it's not too predictable.This certainly isn't a book I'd recommend, but if you like short, quiet horror with more atmosphere (fog, dark rooms, nocturnal noises, a broken grandfather clock that only functions at night) than blood and violence, then you might like ""When Midnight Comes..."" by Carol Beach York."
1,Terrible,Terrible. A waste of film and time. Miserable washed out print. No redeeming values. Skip it.
3,"Eh. Good scarf, but not for the money.","I received this as a gift b/c it was on my wish list. The scarf is soft, a great length and thin which is what I was looking for. However, the autumn cranberry color online looks like a pink, pale yellow, black and turquoise color but in person, it's burgundy, gray, black and a maize/dijon mustard colored yellow..very masculine. The label is a sticker instead of sewn on. For the cost, I feel that this is a bit low quality. I wouldn't pay more than about $15 for it. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but it's not worth the price and the color is better suited for a man."
5,Nice Until it was Stolen,I got the lime green and it was soft and very nice. I gave it to myself for a present. I was very pleased with it until it disappeared one day. I checked everywhere to see if I left it - but it was gone gone gone. I cried.
3,Ok Scarf,I was expecting something more luxurious feeling. This is stiffer than I would expect cashmere to be and I'm pretty sure the label is glued on with some sort of fabric adhesive. It is definitely on the cheaper end of the cashmere scale. I will not be gifting this product as I thought. I will most likely return it. The color is nice though and is exactly as pictured.
2,Quality - just OK,The quality of this scarf is just ok. I saw very similar quality of cashmere scarves all over the streets of New York City for $10 a piece.Vendors are on every street corner and their selection is far better than offered on this website.
2,Poor quality,I was disappointed in this scarf. Reminded me of an item from a market in China - has a stick on Made in England label (I could have made my own label and stuck it on). Poor weave in the middle of the scarf. Bought as a gift but will just keep for myself as it seemed too poor quality for a present.
2,You get what you pay for!,"Scarf was very thin - unsubstantial. I chose color - which was my mistake: blush. Very pale skin tone - looked like under belly of a trout. If you want an inexpensive gift that is technically 'cashmere' this might work. In hindsight, I should have spent a little more on a better product."
2,Not what I was looking for,This was not a soft knit cashmere scarf like I was expecting but a thin felt type scarf with a stick on label instead of a sewn in one. I returned it.
3,If you're looking for WARM cashmere...,"this isn't the scarf for you. It's nice and soft, but definitely won't provide much (if any) comfort from the cold. I bought another one for almost the same price from another seller (not on Amazon) that is exactly what I was looking for, cashmere, thick and warm..."
2,not as good as it sounds,This scarf is not soft like cashmere should be and the label was just a sticker!
5,A Total Surprise,"While I did not pick this item, My girlfriend did & who better to understand another woman as this was a Christmas Gift for my daughter! She told me to ask for her coat color and her favorite colorS for a scarf. While she asks or says money or gift cards are O.K. I felt a personal gift would be better. Well it appears I was right as my daughter loves it and states it was her favorite present!!"
1,Not Good Quality,This is not a soft knit cashmere scarf like I was expecting.Also it uses a stick label(no brand name available). I recommend you not buy it.
3,cute,"not amazing, and it is a sticker ( the tag) however, it is nice.my mother never wears it but the black is nice"
2,Very Thin Material - looks cheap,I would not purchase this again. It would be better to pay more for a scarf that was thicker in material. This is to be a present for my mom and I am embarassed to give it to her as it appears very cheap.
4,Nice Scarf!,"I bought two of these scarves for Christmas gifts. They were advertised as well over $100 each and had a discount making them approximately $25. They are, in my opinion, worth the $25. I can't imagine anyone paying over $100 for them. They are nice and soft and well made. The size is good. It will make a very nice gift."
4,"Super soft, true to color","After reading previous reviews, I was somewhat skeptical of this product. However, when it arrived I was very pleased - the scarf is a beautiful color (antique rose) and extremely soft. My only complaint is that it's not very long, but it's still long enough to wrap or loop. Great buy!"
4,A wonderful book for the curious reader,This book is wonderful if you want to read a little throughout the day when you don't have enough time to really settle down for a full story. It has answers to all the things you usually would take for granted or simply never thought about. The style is pleasant and easy to read and makes every topic a joy to explore. Really a very nice book.
4,DW059: Good Choice,I bought the DW059 for an emergency impact for changing tires and working on farm equipment where there is no power or air. So far has worked great and saved many pulled muscles and skinned knuckles.
3,"1/2"" Impact Not as much torque as it is rated for.","I bought this and I have not been impressed with the power. It is supposed to have 300ft/lbs of torque but I would estimate it is about half of that... more like 150 ft/lbs. It is not as powerful as the Snap-On cordless 1/2"" Impact. It is bulky and very loud. It is not powerful enough to remove high torque bolts, and it is clumbsy and hard to fit in many places. It is good for lug nuts. The rocker trigger design is awkward and it is not variable speed like the Snap-On simple, conventional trigger assy. I love my other DeWalt 18V tools but this one was a disappointment."
5,The Best Series of All Time,"I think that this book is the best of the best of fiction fantasy. Zelazney ends this riveting series with a profoundly moving final book, probably the best I have ever read. It is absolutely incredible, and no words I can use will do it justice."
5,this would get 50 stars if i had anything to say bout it,I was blown away by Spitalfield the moment I heard em. I downloaded stolen from some great writer and was impressed so i went out to best buy and picked it up. Easily the best CD i have ever purchased. All 10 songs are amazing so its hard to pick a favorite. Having seen these guys 3 times makes the Spitalfield experience even more awesome. They are all awesome guys...go see em when they come to your town! SPITALFIELD RULES
5,I'm taken by surprise.,"Note that I have never EVER written a view for any other CD. Spitalfield is the type of band you wish could never get mainstream but would just keep pumping out the records. You'd want them to be your own ""secret unknown band"". But the thing is that they are definately going mainstream with a CD like this. First off I'd like to say that I HATE (HATE HATE HATE) emo, and anything emo. I am generally into hard rock and metal, but I also love my reggae and stuff (the chill music, if you will). I love this band. This CD is great. Yes, the lyrics are mostly about relationships (I know, blah) but the vocal patterns and guitar riffs push this CD through the roof. Some of the greatest music I've heard and I am a very tough critic of music. If you like songs with that little backround riff making the sound just that much cooler, youll love this CD.Get it. Play it. Love it. Then hate when all your friends start asking you if you've heard about this ""new"" Spitalfield band."
5,Chicago suburban band makes the grade,"Great sound...upbeat and catchy arrangements and lyrics....Four very talented hard working guys from the burbs....as reported in the Redeye Commuter news,the chugging, stop-start arrangements of their songs set this band slightly apart from its more straight-forward peers, and the dedication to melody is welcome. These guys rock and the crowds they draw prove it. Check out there video coming soon on MTV 2."
4,What can I say?,"I bought these guys not too long ago and I thought they were pretty sweet, then they started to grow on me even more and now I love them! There are just a few things that are missing and that probably nned to be taken away. I felt that the bass needed to be in the songs a little more, I felt like the guitars were overpowering the bass! ALso the lyrical content ins't that amazing, I mean of course some of them are good but others not so good! But overall, these guys are really good! Who knows, I may even give them a 5th star!"
2,Need to replace the batteries,They don't protect the batteries while it sits on the shelf and will not work when it is received. Nice toy otherwise
3,A great book for people who are just getting into orchids,"I felt that this book was a great starter for anyone who wanted to know more about orchids. The photographs are beautiful, and the instructions are simple and easy."
5,Communion,this was an ideal gift for a grandchild who was celebrating his first Holy Communion. It is nicely made and colorful to go with a joyful occassion
3,How to tell your kids?,"I bought this b/c this is what I watched as a child to find out about sex. As I watched it with my 10 yr old, I was uncomfortable a bit...but this is uncomfortable for parents anyway. The only part I could have done without was them saying how good it feels to have sex. I just wanted the basics...how you do it, why you do it, when you do it, etc. I didn't want her to know that sex feels really good yet!!!! So, just be careful and I would watch it before you pop it in for you child to see if it's suitable for your family."
2,Horrified,"I went to the library to get some sex ed books for my nine year old son. I had the book ""Where did I come from as a child"" and was looking for that for my son, it was checked out but I found this movie and thought it would just be pictures from the book being read on tape so I just played it for him. I was so horrified I could not even get up to turn it off. They zoomed in on the womens breasts, showed a cartoon baby suckling from them and the sex seen with the tickling sensation talk went on for ever monopolizing the video much more then the book. I don't even remember that part as a child in the book. Now I am going to half to back peddle or I will have him experimenting on his sisters for that fun tickly feeling. Terrible."
5,Great camera,"Thus far I have really enjoyed this camera. I just got pictures back from the photo lab that I downloaded the images to and they turned out fantastic. I haven't learned how to work all the bells and whistles yet, but I will. As a matter of fact the school district that I work for has also purchased 2 of these cameras as well. The zoom capabilities is what first drew me to the camera, because I wanted to be able to take closer pictures of my son playing high school basketball this year. I would encourage prospective buyers to look further into all the specs before purchasing any camera and then give this one a try. I'm sold on it!"
1,Hope your's works.............,"Mine stopped working 10 days after purchase. This was 3 days into the 4 week trip that was my reason for buying it.Sony would not allow me to return the camera for a refund or a replacement. They required that I ship it to Precision Camera in CT for repair. Precision Camera diagnosed the problem quickly but estimates a 2 to 6 week wait for parts from Sony!!!!!!!!I called Sony and was told parts are not available because this is a new product. They reiterated that their corporate policy was ""no refunds, no replacements"". And they will not extend the warranty to cover my time without a camera!I thought Sony was a better company. No more Sony products for me."
5,never miss another shot again,"I've had the camera about one month and it has never produced anything but the best pics I've ever taken.A zoom camera is now a must-have in my opinion. For years we've missed shots at school plays, church events, etc since seating is often too far away for 3-4x zoom. With this Sony cam, we capture all those shots important to parents, I didn't believe that a camera could catch the sharpest details of my sons expressions during football games,even at a distance, but this camera does that every time.Sharp, bright, and fast. When you press the button on this cam, there's hardly a lag at all before the pic is taken, my old cam had such a delay that the object in the viewer was always gone by the time the camera actually snapped the pic. Great camera all around, the best I've ever owned."
1,Bad auto focus,After a week of use the auto focus quite working. I really liked the camera but was dissapointed with the auto focus failure. Had to return for repair.
4,A seldom-seen classic,"This movie lightly fictionalizes the birth of one of the first American horse breeds, the Morgan. Named for its founder, a Colonial schoolteacher named Justin Morgan (Don Murray), the breed's foundation sire was a versatile little bay called Figure because he was such a ""fine figure of a horse."" The multi-talented equine could pull a carriage, do hard labor, carry a rider for miles in comfort, and win trotting and running races. Several Morgans portrayed Figure throughout the stages of his life, but the filmmakers did a good job of matching the animals.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,Movie Great--DVD not!,"Please be aware when buying this movie it does not play on all machines. We have a Sony player/recorder and it will not play on it. It plays on our laptop, computer and other DVD player. Very disappointing. Amazon handled the return well and the customer service was good but felt I needed to let others know. Just beware it doesn't play in all machines."
1,awful,awful sucks bad movie dont watch disney crap stinky poopy crapy bad vant stand lousy. not worth a second of your time stay away from this one
3,Okay - but a little thick for my grip size,"I had high hopes for this yawara. I liked the fact that it was made of wood. The length was just what I was looking for but after it arrived, I discovered it was a bit thick around the middle for my grip size. Maybe for a larger hand it would be okay (I am 5.8, 170 pounds)."
4,yawara,"this is a rewal good product, the only problem is you look at the pic of it, it appears to look a nice brown wood tone, when we opened the package it arrived in and opened it, it was orange in color, but even with that we are very satisfied"
4,Old Style Modem But it Works,I have to use this modem to communicate with traffic signal controllers. It works and is very reliable. Its easy to set up and small so does not take a lot of space inside the cabinet. Can't go wrong with this one.
3,Standard fax modem,"This is the standard fax modem by US Robotics, the one we all need and use. It has been working fine, as expected, since we got it.My only comment is that you should realize that it only has a serial connection and NOT a USB connection to access your computer/server. We fortunately had a cable that would work, but were surprised when there was no USB connection as we had previously."
1,Dead at 19 months,I thought this modem was ok until it just stopped dead after about 18 months- could not even get the power light to come on.Will now try another brand.
1,"Don't Buy This Item, Better Ones Out There","I bought my modem about 3 weeks ago after the original one in my computer quit. For the first couple of weeks it was great, relatively quick initial connection and pages seemed to load more faster and more smoothly. However, in just the past 24 hours the speaker that lets me hear the modem function has quit with no reason or indication showing in the diagnostics that there was a problem and the initial connection time has slowed down.The troubleshooting information is difficult to follow, I had a lot of problems installing the driver and to be honest there are better, more reliable brands out there that don't cost as much as this one. Very, very disappointed."
1,US ROBOTICS V.92 EXTERNAL 56K FAXMODEM,"I am really diaappointed with this modem. It does not live up to is advertising features. The settings changs without notice even though they have been saved to modem. This modem is slower than the internal modem I replaced. This modem was supposed to allow me to take a calls while online but that feature does not work even with the upgrades I received from the manufacturer's web site. The upgraded specified for this modem were not helpful. I also found out that V.92 is not supported by my ISP. This modem was a step back into the 90""s."
1,What a JOKE...!,This is a piece of junk...Do not purchase this modem...Refuses to answer...Locks up...Driver XP issues
4,Helpful information and encouragement toward lifestyle changes,This book gives the reader a sense that they can be in charge of their body and how disease effects them. It gives some commons sense and not so common sense ideas of how to take care of yourself when dealing with cancer. I would recommend it as an alternative therapy resource and guide to making positive changes.
4,educational,"This book was recommended to me by a holistic practitioner, I found its a good read but a little too complicated for my taste, there is a lot of useful information and exercises."
3,"Eh, its ok",I'm a big fan of the Simpsons and the toy is pretty neat. Something nice to set on a bookshelf and forget about. Don't forget to turn the auto function off. I kept hearing noises and couldn't figure where they were coming from.
4,Simpsons flashback playset with figures,Very fun...my boyfriend is a serious Simpsons collector and just loved this.
4,"Good for ""side"" collection","Since the toy doesn't interact with the rest of the WOS collection, that is a drawback, but you instantly have all of the interactive characters available and it creates a nice ""isolated"" display. On the whole, a nice addition or momento."
4,Great price for this set,"[...]It's a cool set to hard core Simpsons fans and World Of Springfield completists, but casual viewers of the show may think they got some kind of factory second with these early, crude versions made into three dimensions."
3,OK For The Price,"This Simpsons Flashback Playset would be better if the little figurines looked more like the actual Simpson family. They aren't really to play with, more for collectors or big fans of the show (like me). The paint job wasn't exactly perfect, but I didn't really mind."
2,batteries leaked!,This toy came to me with two leaking batteries in it that ruined the sound feature on this toy. Very dangerous. Must have been why it was 7 dollars. The characters are fun though. Look great.
5,I like it,Even though I'm the type that does not open the productsit's still cool any simpson fan should own ita must have for simpson collectors
2,Not so much fun.,"This toy is cheaply made. It only works half the time. If the pieces are not on there just right, it will not work. You really have to pry them off and it seems like it is about to break when you do switch them around. I recommend this to sit on the shelf only."
3,just stands and makes noise,"The set looks very nice (old school Simpsons by the way), but it doesnt do very much besides stand there and make noise... which is what some people are looking for."
4,I've had this set for almost a year,"The Knipex Plier Wrench is quite unique, it looks like a pair of pliers but works as a wrench. The jaws are smooth faced and remain parallel as you open and close them. AS you turn the fastener the jaws tighten on the flats helping prevent round over. For the most part it works but not always as well as I had hoped. On really tight fasteners a some of the force you exert is used to hold the jaws closed and not used as torque to turn the fastener. This means you work even harder to break it lose. I've also had the jaws cam open on tight fasteners when I was using the Pliers Wrench at a awkward angle. For the most part they work well and I use them often but there not always the right tool for the job."
3,Fun Read - Not up to par with others in the series!,"I loved finding out what happened to Lady May. The focus on Etienne made the book enjoyable. He is so patient [ok dreamy!] -- but Lady May for all her education seemed too innocent. After all she had lived in the country and should have known a little more than she did! Her about-face concerning men seemed a little hasty. Her mother's about-face, completely changing her personality wrapped it all up in a neat little package (too contrived!).But it still was a fun read. If you have read the others in the series (Lord St. Claire's Angel & Lady Delafont's Dilemma) you will definately want to read this. There are updates on both the heroines from the other books. I don't think this book would stand alone. You possibly need to read the others to understand Lady May at all. But since I did read them in order, it made sense.Worth reading but not as good as the others in the series."
4,Adorable but a bit uncomfortable,"I purchased these in moss and although the heel looks as though it's cork material in the picture, it's actually a shiny wood and looks stunning. These shoes are so adorable and flatter my wardrobe, however the tend to pinch my pinky toes so I don't find them practical for excessive walking."
4,Good Alternative Heat Source,"Great alternative source of heat. While these pups have DOUBLED in price in recent years (no doubt because they cost SO much more to make, right Mr. Manufacturer???), they still will save you on heating costs this year and several more to come. They are dangerous so be careful if you have pets, small children or intend to drink a lot. But they do throw out a fair amount of heat and are a good supplemental source. Be forewarned - they do not last forever. I burn them out about every three years. Overall, still a good deal - esp if you don't like dragging in firewood."
2,This really reeked,I didn't get a chance to hear too much of it but I thought that it was awful how the people made purple haze into such a crummy song. Why couldn't they use the normal song?
1,Why not just let Yanni sing Hey Joe,I'm sorry but a CD like this should not have been aloud to even be recorded. If I could have given it zero stars I would have. Jimi Hendrix fans should all agree the instruments used in this arent even worth the privelaged of being burned. The music on this CD has been completely stripped of all the soul Jimi put into them. All that is left is bad sound.
3,The Same Old Thing,"This book is great for two types of children: a grammar-school child that has yet to experience the peer pressure described in this book and a high-risk child that requires the positive reinforcement she/he lacks at home.From a teen-ager's perspective, the book is boring and is filled with what my 13-year-old describes as ""the same old thing."" This book appeals to the misguided and naive, neither of which my child happens to be.From a parental perspective, the book reinforces a passive approach to addressing combative people/situations with which I had much difficulty advocating. On a personal level, the author believes her life experiences qualifies her to write an advice book of this nature and I applaud her efforts; however, she will probably feel differently about 50% of the advice she has given AFTER she has raised her own children."
2,"Look Elsewhere, Comrades.","Not a book but a pamphlet;Not a an argument but excerpts;Not worth your time but for the introduction to the man's thoughts.While snipping out some interesting parts of Trotsky's writings, I would not recommend this specific work unless it was passed on to you. I plan on finding his _Struggle Against Fascism in Germany_ or a more complete edition of works to supplement this reading."
2,Trotsky's writings through the filter of Pathfinder,"""Fascism, what it is and how to fight it"" is presented as a work by Leon Trotsky, but is in fact an assemblage of excerpts from various of Trotsky's writings, collected and ordered by Sara Lobman and printed by the Pathfinder Press. The original source for each passage is cited in a footnote. Other footnotes, apparently written by Ms. Lobman to make Trotsky's references more familiar, give historically useful facts such as ""The Jacobins were the revolutionary petty-bourgeois forces in the French Revolution of 1789."" As a short introduction to Trotsky's thought, it can serve its purpose provided one is already versed in Marxist rhetoric."
2,Overall disappointing,"After reading Stogo's first book, I thought this one would be just as good. Boy, was I disappointed. This book is extremely sloppy -- the editing is atrocious, and there are conflicting statements, sometimes in consecutive sections.His understanding of standard startup accounting principles is pretty weak -- my SBA advisor (a retired accountant) laughed at some of the startup cost itemizations.Overall, I *did* learn some good info from this book, but I was happy I bought it used on Amazon, rather than paying the ridiculous list price of this one."
2,SOME GOOD STUFF...SOME NOT SO HELP FULL,"FOR THE PRICE, I FOUND THIS BOOK A BIT FILLED WITH THE AUTHORS PERSONAL IDEAS ON HOW TO CONVINCE A BANK TO FINANCE AN ICE CREAM SHOP, RATHER THAN JUST GIVE ME THE NUTS AND BOLTS INFORMATION I SOUGHT TO MAKE ICE CREAM AND RUN A SUCCESSFULL SHOP, AND ALLOW ME TO WORRY ABOUT IT'S FINANCING. ALSO THERE IS NO MENTION OF ANY SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM PRODUCTS OR IT'S PROFITABILTY. ALL IN ALL I WAS DISSAPOINTED FOR THE MONEY. I REALLY BELEIVE I DID NOT BENEFIT GREATLY BEYOND THE COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE I ALLREADY HAD, EXCEPT FOR THE GENERAL ENCOURAGEMENT THE BOOK LENDS TO VENTURING INTO THE ICE CREAM BUISINESS IN GENERAL."
2,Don't say you weren't warned,"Stogo may know the commercial ice cream business (in fact, it appears that he does) but he also knows how to pack what he knows into a small, cheap space. In other words, this spiral-bound book, about the size and production quality of a very modest Jr. League cookbook, costs a very dear...[amount]. If you're opening an ice cream store, you may be able to bury that price tag in your other start-up costs. If you're just a curious reader or an ice cream lover, however, don't spend the money. (There are a lot of delicious-sounding recipes, but they're in commercial bulk versions and often call for ingredients, such as ""Stabilizer CC-917,"" home cooks may not want to use.) Think of how much Haagen Daz you could buy for...[the money]!"
1,Worked for about a week!,This was DOA for the most part. It worked for about a week and now is completely dead.
4,Descent dell replacement battery,"So far so good. It holds a pretty decent charge giving me 2 to 3 hours of battery life depending on what I'm doing. It does not fit as flush as the dell branded battery I had before did, but for a third of the price it is doing great. Here's hoping it lasts for a couple years."
2,dell notebook battery,"Though i got the item in time, i do not think my battery holds any charge at all. without being connected to a power supply, the computer does not even powered on! i think i bought it!!!"
3,"It's cheesy, But it's worthy.","This video is sorta cheesey. But, it's still good. I will give you time to think it over, but here's one little tip: If you don't like when the IMF doesn't socially confront the enemy, it's not the right video for you. But, this tape is still worthy of watching."
1,Waste of Money,If Carlos Santana heard this CD he would probably sue for defamation of character.This sounds absolutely nothing like Santana and his great band. DON'T waste your money.Too bad it can't be returned.
1,B^!!S#!t product.,"It should say clearly ""NO LYRICS ON SCREEN"" Tihs is not a KARAOKE product.DO NOT BUY THIS B^!!S#!t produt."
5,Major tune up due [battery change] after 7th years of reliable service day and night.,"I have had 5 of this product through out my house for almost 7 years. They were so reliable and maintenance free, other than hearing the relays twice a day at dawn and dusk, I almost forgot about their existance. Taking the lights on and off for granted until sometime last week. Thought one of them had just gave up and kicked the bucket. Turned out that the battery is low. Then I started shopping for batteries and had a hard time swallowing $7/battery they want to charge at local store. Bought some replacement Sanyo two pack CR2 for under $5 at this very site to change all of them out. Everything seems to be back to business. There may be more fancy timers out there which didn't exist back then, given where credit is due, this is a prouct I'd recommand and buy again if needed. Now, I wonder with all of the battery technology advancements, will these new CR2 give me 10 years...?"
2,Dangerous even...,"I had it for 1 year. Within 3 months, it maintained a close connection (always on). Several months later, it blew the circuit that it was on. The latter condition leads me to believe that such a device would be dangerous on certain boxes, especially those homes still using fuses, or ITE breakers. Until Intermatic recognizes this and corrects the design flaw, caveat emptor."
2,"switch, not so good","We had 2 of these before. They work fine, but this one, has been a pain. We have tried programming it over and over. It turns on fine, but never turns off, we have to switch it off ourselves. Unfortunately, we didn't get it installed before the time to return had run out, so we are stuck with a half working switch."
4,OK so far,"Been using this for about six weeks now and it seems to be working fine. Installation was a bit of a chore because my existing switch box was too shallow and I had to find an extender, as I didn't want to change the box. The result sticks out from the wall about an inch and looks a little clunkier than it could. Programming was not as difficult as some reviews suggest, maybe because I used the dusk-dawn default. Hope it lasts."
4,"Great timer, would definitely purchase again","Purchased this product for two light fixtures illuminating my driveway. I wanted to switch the bulbs in these fixtures from incandescent to fluorescent bulbs and I had read that some of these switches do not work well with fluorescent bulbs.I took a chance and ordered this switch and I am very happy with it. The installation isn't too bad if you are comfortable with electrical. It was a little tricky to program and the instructions were not totally clear (hence the 4 star rating) but after some trial and error, I had it programmed correctly.Now my driveway is illuminated at dusk and shuts off at dawn automatically. I replaced two 60 watt bulbs with two 100 watt equivalent fluorescent bulbs that use only 46 watts combined. It is much brighter and I feel good about saving energy and $$."
4,No fuss once it is programmed,"This unit is still adjusting itself after four years. The buttons and screen are too tiny, but the unit works and can be temporarily overridden when needed. I have not seen anything better for the price.Followup: This timer is still accurate after almost six years. I've nearly forgotten about the outside lights because this thing is working so well."
2,"Intermatic Switches Break Down, Hard to Program","Please read the 1-star reviews to see that Intermatic has problems with the units breaking down after time. I'm about to order my 4th unit in 5 years, because my 3rd unit just stopped working after 2 years (which is longer than my previous ones lasted). It's particularly annoying that the unit has a ""NoOp"" message, basically telling you it's time to buy a new one. I've grown to hate seeing that message. I kind of hate this company for producing a product that fails so frequently, but I still may order another one because I haven't found another option. I will do a little more searching after I finish this review.Also, these Intermatic switch timers are definitely not easy to program, and I can understand why some people never figure out how to set them up.On the pro side, the auto settings that account for sunrise and sunset work well."
4,Electronic Lights Control,"I bought this to replace an older Intermatic controller. The old one finally gave out after about 5 or 6 years, and I couldn't find the same model...evidently discontinued. I found this one on another website, and located it on Amazon. It actually performs better than the one I replaced, and is much easier to setup/program. And best of all, the price was right!"
5,Excellent Product,"The self adjusting Switch Timer is a quality product. If you use the supplemental instructions to set it up, it is really quite easy. It automatically turns on and off in your location zone (north, midstate, south) and adjusts for you so that you never really have to reset on/off times. You can override the general instructions and set it for weekday and weekends if you so wish or for your own set times. Having had an older version of this type of unit, this one far exceeds ease of use and hopefully, reliability."
1,"Terrible documentation, difficult to use","I mentioned that I had purchased this product to a contractor working on my kitchen, and he told me it was so difficult to program that several people he knew had thrown it away. I assured him that, with my 30+ years in software development and working with PCs, I felt certain I could get it working.Contractor was right. Impossible to use. Returning product to Home Depot ASAP. If you buy, ask to see the programming instructions first!"
2,Can anybody program this thing?,"I read the reviews but figured - how hard could it be? I still haven't figured it out, may be this weekend's project."
1,Wouldn't Recommend Intermatic,I have bought two previous generation Intermatic Switch Timers and they both have failed. I wouldn't recommend buying this one either - although I haven't purchased this specific model.
4,Only timer for CF bulbs,"This is the only timer I could find that works for CF bulbs. Installs easily. Programming is a little clunky and non-intuitive, but do-able. (Don't throw away the programming instructions. You'll need them again.) So far it's performed flawlessly for about a month, using the self-adjusting ""dusk-to-dawn"" feature."
5,Does what it says!,"this product works very well. It is important to get this model with the relay for controlling heavier electrical Wattages or even fluorescent lights. If you get the other model which doesn't use a relay you will have problems with things like high wattage halogen lights or fluorescents. Easy to program, basically set it and forget it. I know, that's an annoying phrase..."
5,works great,"I installed 2 of these units for fixtures with CFL bulbs. The installation was extremely easy. when programming, follow the separate programming "" cheat sheet"" rather than the installation manual, it's a lot easier.So far, I'm pleased with the product."
2,Intermatic st01 battery life,We recently bought a house with two of these controls. One of the two needed the battery replaced which I did a month ago with a new fully charged battery and it has died already. I'm pretty sure from others experience with this model that it wasn't due to a bad battery. The Duracell was dated as good to 2017.
2,"ST01 series ""eats"" batteries",I had to replace an earlier model that went belly-up a couple of months ago after working fine for 4 years. The replacement unit that I picked up was the Intermatic Model ST01 series. The engineers had redesigned the unit to use a camera battery (CR-2) instead of the previous models AAA batteries. Bad design!!! The CR-2s only last less than two months. I've gone through 4 batteries in about 7 months. They should never have gotten away from the AAA batteries!!! ...I've got to find another timer that uses a different battery design.
2,I really want to like it...,I even replaced it 3 different times. But after 3-6months they just stop working. Looking for something else to use now.
3,Been installing lots of these,I have been installing lots of these switches and are very good and durable. They are commercial grade and been also being used in where I work.
3,Intermatic ST01C Switch Timer,"The unit I received on my internet order was faulty. It would turn lights OFF but would not turn lights ON. After numerous attempts to re-program the unit it still failed to function properly. To verify that the unit was faulty I purchased an identical ST01C from a local building supply source and found the replacement unit to function perfectly. My concern is mostly: ""The percentage of DOA units coming from the manufacturer and the resulting RETURNS PROCESS!"""
3,Intermatic Switch,Difficult to program. Works well with electric towel warmers and easily installs with multible units. Take your time with programming.
2,Complex Plot,"The author of Sacred Honor did her homework. The book is well-researched and very complex of plot. I also enjoyed how she very seamlessly wove both historical and fictional characters into the storyline, but I needed one main character with whom I could relate (someone I really liked and could identify with emotionally) to ""carry"" me through the story. Sometimes I felt too much afloat among the varied plot lines."
4,A must for fans of Maria Callas,"This is a ""must"" for fans of Maria Callas, but not necessarily so for fans of the arts of Maria Callas. It covers a lot of Maria's life, but not too much of her art. I would have given it 5 star if it had given the full footage of her singing of Norma's Casta Diva (they show only seconds of it). She was very elegant even at her fifties. Can any one tell me how many sopranos are there (or have ever been) who are pretty, slim,can sing AND can act very well at the same time? Maria Callas is the only one I know (hmm, may be I am ignorant...) who can live up to the very high expectation of most opera fans. The DVD also shows her as a young woman when she was still fat. But she was indeed not very fat. I don't think Cecilia Bartoli is slimmer than she was. It was such a great loss to opera fans that she should be born so early. Otherwise we should have many more of her art to enjoy through these visual material."
3,1 hour 16 minutes,"The programme includes interviews with famous people who knew Maria Callas - such as Franco Zeffirelli and Carlo Maria Giulini - and is interspersed with extracts from famous concerts and recordings, including two duets with Giuseppe di Stefano.Featuring extracts from the following performances:""Vissi d'arte"" - from Tosca by Puccini""Casta Diva"" - from Norma by Bellini""Una voce poco fa"" - from Il barbiere di Siviglia by Rossini""Habanera"" - from Carmen by Bizet: Concert at Covent GardenCavalleria Rusticana - by Mascagni: Duet with Giuseppe di StefanoL'elisir d'amore - by Donizetti: Duet with Giuseppe di StefanoFEATURES OF THE DVD:- easy access to selected parts of the programme by means of a navigational timeline- optional on-screen subtitles in English, French or German (but not Italian)- on-screen information about Callas's life and stage roles- linear PCM (uncompressed) sound"
4,Fun,I really enjoyed this book. It is well written and fast moving. I Look forward to other books in the series.
4,This is a good series,I have enjoyed reading a few of the Faye Longchamp stories and I would recommend them to others who are looking for a good read.
3,Wordy,"I really think this author is good. But the author is a little too long in the mouth about some details. Book got a little boring in spots. Overall, though, a good book."
4,Good and interesting,Artifacts: A Faye Longchamp Mystery is good. Lots of twists and turns to keep you intersted. Makes you wonder what could be hidden in in lots of other old places for real.
4,Really Good First Novel,"Plot described well in product description and PW review, so no need to rehash. I found Faye Longchamp a refreshing choice for a protagonist. No ex-Seal or boozy on the skids detective here. We have a mixed heritage young woman struggling to keep her ancestral home, sometimes at odds with herself for the need to ""pothunt"" to raise cash. Her friend, Joe Mantooth, isn't a Dr. Watson type. He is a Native American who would have most likely been happier living in an earlier time.I bought this book and see it is currently free. I don't regret my purchase and those of you who are able to obtain it at no charge, count your blessings because you're getting a great deal. I will be continuing with this series."
5,Outstanding!,"A debut novel by Mary Anna Evans, this is wonderful mystery set in the panhandle of North Florida. Faye Longchamp is, at heart, an archeologist. However, she is driven to illegal digging to save Joyeuse, her ancestral home. While engaging in this activity, Faye, with her companion Joe (yum, yum!), uncover a body on one of the nearby islands. When they go back to examine it, the body had disappeared. Why? Who else knew?Meanwhile, at the respectable dig where Faye is assisting a former professor, two of the students left on the island overnight disappear.What is happening in Faye's quiet corner of the world? How could she keep Joyeuse? How could she keep Joyeuse hidden???Who else was digging illegally?I loved this book, and cannot wait for the next installment. I was pleasantly surprised with Ms. Evans first novel, and I continue to look forward to Faye's next adventure."
4,Florida Panhandle History & Mystery!,"I can't say enough about this series. I discovered it earlier this year and have now read four of the books. Faye is such a strong, interesting character and both the history of the area and the archaeological finds are fascinating - providing such a great platform for the mystery. This is true for all of the books, just to let you know!"
5,Best ever,I love a good mystery and also have a love for finding lost things. This book satisfies both of them! It one of the best stories that I have seen in years. I would recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of stories!
2,Autolite 4162 spark plug,"This plug may be the matching no. for the Bosch plug, but it is to wide to fit the cylinder head of a BMW F800 GS. I could not use this plug for intended purpose."
4,Great book!,"Very interesting and quick read. Excellent lessons on leadership. I was hesitant to read it because I thought it would be another cliche book written for men, but it was very interesting."
1,A Poor Retread of Lombardi Quotes,"The Lombardi Rules attempts to provide a philosophical background of Coach Lombardi's beliefs and apply them to life and business. This was written by Vince Lombardi Jr, not the man himself, and although you'd expect his son to also possess many of the inspiring attributes of Coach Lombardi, they are not exhibited in this book. It is essentially a collection of Vince Lombardi quotes turned into 2-3 page chapters. Making matters worse is that the text supporting the quotes ranges from cliche to painfully obvious with nothing profound or meaningful, not even a decent example from Lombardi's illustrious coaching career. Its always frustrating when you could read the chapter headings and gain as much value as the entire book. You would be better served just searching for Vince Lombardi quotes than wasting any time with this book."
4,becoming a rare find...,"overall i like the details, but assembling or putting this toy together needs more tlc...the rifle in particular to be inserted to the hand of the sniper. but when you do it right, it will be really nice to see it in you display case. thanks"
3,Leaves you wanting more....sad,"Lloyd C. Douglas is a fabulous writer. The premise behind the book is light-hearted and fun. All the siblings are older now and have been invited back to their family home for a Christmas together to remember and connect with the past. The characters, as always with Douglas, are very real and likeable. The problem is that he gets started with the story but wraps it up so quickly that you are left with a story that is getting interesting but has now finished. It was super disappointing, only because I was enjoying the characters and the plot so well and then it was over. Too late to wish it was different, of course, but be wary if you are looking for a Christmas story as poignant as his other books. Still glad I have it and that I read it. Very homespun delightful read.Published in 1937 - 118 pages but large print and the pages are not full (margins are large). The empty pages and the chapter pages are counted in the 118 pages, so this is really a short story."
3,Not as effective as the Boss NS-2,"Purchased this MXR pedal based on the brand reputation, rather than replacing my Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor.I have to say that I am disappointed.It has various settings for various instruments, when setup for an electric guitar, I still get hissing, even with moderate gain.I purchased this item mainly to offset hissing from a Big Muff Pi Pedal (Fuzz), and it didn't take much from it.That being said, it works much better in regards to attack of the guitar than the NS-2But I wish I had just gone with what I know works and gotten the NS-2 pedal.My rig:Orange Tiny TerrorEgnater 1x12 Cab(Monster Stereo and Instrument Cables)BOSS RC-20XL Loop StationBOSS ME-70 Multi-Effects ProcessorBig Muff Pi Fuzz Distortion pedal"
1,Snippy,"For me, this was a useless piece of snippy little one-liners, aimed at making fun of aging and the aged. One-page cartoon drawings with one-liners were not the self-help offering I thought the book would be. I was not amused."
1,Minimally amusing and only on occasion,"I found this collection of jokes about the moods and behaviors of old men to be only slightly amusing at times. Nearly all are based on the grumpy, chauvinistic, extremely opinionated and critical of the wife cliché set that has been so vastly overused. Some examples are:*) Think complimenting their wives will spoil them.*) Still think Jane Fonda is a traitor.*) Have permanent frown lines.*) Consider the words ""male chauvinist pig"" a compliment."
2,Way Too Small,"I had seen this book in a store and thought it would be a good bathroom book for my boyfriend. It was $9.99, however, it was a much larger version. Not knowingly, I thought the price was great online so I ordered it, only to be shocked by the minuscule size of it. Would return it but it's not worth the cost to ship it back. I'll just have to chalk it up to experience."
3,"cute, but very small","I bought this book to give as a gift. It is very cute, but it is also very small. I was expecting to wrap this as a present, but instead since it is only about 3 or 4 inches square, I will have to place it in a basket with some other gifts to make it more presentable."
1,Tiny book; not very humorous,"Tiny book; nearly as small as a pack of cigarettes. The author manifests her, obvious, liberal left-wing views, so not very humorous much of the time. Seemed more often like a soapbox platform for her PC opinions, instead of just a book of funny slogans and sayings. Sad really."
1,Not Funny,This is more liberal claptrap that is not funny. You can tell this was written by a woman who has a political agenda. Skip it!
4,Great region-specific gardening resource,"This book has helped me make the transition to gardening in the Central Valley. Besides being a new gardener, I'm also new to the Sacramento area. Northern California Gardening explains plant care clearly and includes a lot of recommendations for plants that thrive in the different NorCal micro-climates.Because there's a limit to how much the book can cover, some subjects aren't explained as thoroughly as a beginner (like me) needs, but it provides me with a good starting point.I love that the book is divided up by the different months of the year, specifying what tasks I need to consider during each month. It gets me excited about what gardening I will be doing in a few months' time."
2,No photographs!,"If you are looking for guide that includes photos, you will be disappointed. If you are a novice looking for a visual guide to give you design ideas, this is not an appropriate book."
1,No Drought Tolerant Section?,Pretty good book but beware the cover lists that there is a special section on drought tolerant and xeriscaping which is no where to be found.Advice on Fushsias and Hydrangeas is very good.
2,Don't be fooled by the gorgeous cover photo!,"Since a lot of the joy of gardening is visual, I was surprised to find this book includes NO photos of the plants described.Not exactly helpful if you're trying to decide what to plant!There are some good hints, and the book is well-organized, but an occasional sketchy hand drawing is no substitute for photos. I suspect the author and publisher were trying to cut costs.Overall, very disappointing."
2,Disappointing,"I loved _The Longing Ring_ and also loved Kubasik's Earth Dawn short story _Before Life Ends_ but this was different. The use of the 1st person narration made for too much introspection, especially as the relationship between Releanna and J'role was the biggest part of the plot. The Therans being a mix of all different races didn't seem very realistic and there was only one hint of a horror in the entire story (and they are probably the coolest thing about Earth Dawn). The Crystal Raiders were great, but other than that I didn't find much to like about the story."
5,"The song ""Iris"" exemplifies what real rock music is","I think the Goo Goo Dolls music really stands in class by itself.Their music posesses a diversity that so many of the bands today lack.They're not studio creations like the Backstreet Boys. They deserve a hell of a lot more recognition, because they're natural born musicians."
5,Fabulous!!!!!!!,I LOVED this song. It just cries out for fame. It kicks some seroius @$$- Raleigh (my bf) and I liked it so much we made it our song!!!!!!
3,Pretty Good.....,"Never been a fan of Goo Goo Dolls; never will. Yet when I heard 'Iris' I thought it was a great song. Why did I give it a 3? Like any other song, it becomes annoying when every radio station plays it over and over. Some of our most hated music used to be the most loved. Still, 'Iris' is a great song losing its meaning due to over-playing."
5,the song is awesome,"""Iris"" is the best selling soundtrack song I think it touched my heart deeply I never even seen the movie but from hearing that song I get a picture of what the movie is about."
3,"Goo Goo Dolls ""Iris"" been overplayed!","When i first heard the goo goo dolls new song ""iris"", i liked the mellow tune and the unusual lyrics, but with every radio station playing the song over and over again, you can't help but begin to hate the song. Unfotunetly, ""iris"" is too much like every other sappy summer movie song that hopes to make you feel depressed or rejuvenated somehow."
5,Awesome!!!,Has graet tunes and much more.This is one of my top five song picks.This is a must buy!!!
5,This is an awesome song,This is prabably on e of my favorite Alternative songs. I never used to like the Goo Goo Dolls until I heard this song!
5,Robert Jordan's penname?,"Wow. This book is awesome! I found myself wrapped up in it from the beginning to the end. There is also a rumor circulating around that this book/series was actually written by Robert Jordan. He apparently wrote this under some assumed identity. I also know this is a 5 book series, so the previous reviews missed the point. This book was an introduction to a new world. It was meant to leave some unanswered questions, but I thought it tied up a few of the loose ends nicely. It reminded me of the first Dragonlance book, Dragons of Autumn Twilight! If you have not read this book you and you love fantasy, then you are missing out! It is worth the read!"
2,incomplete,"The story starts out a bit interesting and it remains that way throughout most of the book. It introduces many possibilities that the storyline MAY have followed, however, the ending is a complete disappointment. Many of the concepts and ideas do not follow through and are left out at the end. You would think that a serious and important event occurred at one point to have some sort of meaning later. Yet, about half of the time, that is not the case. The ending is abrupt and too sudden. Actually, it does not seem like an ending at all. If everything ties up nicely, then the book would have been pleasant to read. I keep expecting that something is going to happen, but nothing does. To simply put it, I am confused and disatisfied. Is there suppose to be a sequel or what? If so, then where is the indication?"
5,A really good book from an new author!,"Unlike some of the other reviews, I didn't look to the book for truth or fiction. I liked the book for what it was, a really good book. This author has a ""down-to-earth"" style of writing that makes it quick to read and easy to understand. He obviously had a lot of background or he couldn't have written with such feeling has he did. I look forward to his next book, and according to the Spooky website, he plans on writing more...GO FOR IT!"
2,How could it be?,"First, I will not claim to have worked with a ""Spooky"" team to give my review validity. If all this ""black operations"" stuff is true how is the government allowing Mr. King to write such a book. The book is a great read but seems to be written by someone who has read too many Clancy novels. Mr. King is allowed to get back to the United States even though the guy who ""killed"" his team was still with him. These Spooky teams may well exist but no one reviewing this book has or ever will work with one of the teams."
1,A work of fiction and stolen valour.,"This ""author"" never did the things he did and never went the places he said. His records are public. They have been published. It's disgusting he is out there parading this book as fact. REAL MEN have fought and died for this country. The only thing this author has done is read one too many Tom Clancy novels. Shameful."
1,"Mr King, our next contestant in ""Stolen Valor.""","Typos everywhere! Lousy grammar! Thats covers the book, now I'll move on to the content. Based upon 16 years as a veteran of the military I can say ""Mr. King...your a fraud! Your ""book"" was full of discrepacies that reached out and slapped me in the face. I won't waste my time sorting thru them. Last thing I'll say and PLEASE all you knowledgable readers think about this, Mr King the term MRE wasn't coined until 1983. You should have said C-RAT! And I won't even discuss the OV-10 boondoggle! Your a fake, and how you can drag others service to this country thru the dirt is uncharacteristic of a true ""Warrior"", disgruntled by your government or not! See you at the ""Wall"" and try to hold those tears back. I'm sure your making a bundle! Stick to the fiction."
1,Spooky 8 - A journey into poor literature,"Unsophisticated devotees of military based stories and Walter Mitty clones will like this book for it's rather tedious plot and tired prose. Listing this particular book as a work of nonfiction does a egregious disservice to authors who have actually done the research or have faithfully recounted their own experiences. Had it been published earlier, this is one of those works that would have been listed in the book ""Stolen Valor"" as prime example of unmitigated (and unwarranted) self glorification."
1,Fact or Fiction,"I served with the 5th Special Forces in Vietnam. I was interested in this book made an inquiry into it through my current Special Forces contacts. I found that nobody ever heard of this man. The Special Operations Association will be held from September 27 through October 1, 2000 at the Plaza hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. If anybody is interested in knowing if this book is fact or fiction there will be 800 current and former Special Ops Veterans there. The Special Forces and Special Ops community is small and tight and when speaking to each other they will have either know somebody or heard of them. I have yet heard any of them to state that this book is anything but fiction."
1,Wil the real John Rambo please stand up?,"I could only get through the first 3 chapters before I gave up on this book. Poorly researched and written, it's even bad fiction, but touted as the truth... it's just plain sad. From the Rambo-esque photo on the back to the mistakes regarding equipment nomeclature and far fetched story. Tom Clancy writes better pieces of work (Rainbow Six, Clear and Present Danger, and Without Remorse). Stick w/ the real deal like Bob Mayer and Dick Couch (Both Spec Ops veterans who write awesome fiction based on fact). I'm donating my copy to the local thrift store."
2,Dialog,"I read this book for a school project, after reading the back cover it sound like it was going to be a good action book, which it was for the most part. After getting done reading the whole book it left me wanting more there was simply put no conclusion, and the dialog between characters was ridiculous, it was some of the worst writing I have ever read. I will give him props for the action scenes that is when the authors writing was truly superb. King says this book is based on true accounts of his own experiences, which I do not believe, mainly because the whole plot of the book was unbelieveable, especially the part about the far seers."
4,Really good book,"I got this book for Christmas and it turned out to be a really good book. Onlike others, I didn't dwell on the fact/fiction issues. I know this kind of thing has been going on for many years and I can't do anything about it. As for the book, WOW, what a great story. I'm looking forward to more of his work"
1,Don't Waste Time with Spooky 8,"This is the kind of book I promised myself I'd never waste time with; lousy dialogue telling the story of a hot dog writing about all his hot dogging, real or imagined. Typos galore! String them all together and maybe it's a secret code.Here's one unforgettable sample of manly Chance talking to an admiring Sue, found on page 158. ""I don't know how you do it,"" she said. ""Every time I see you, you're always in control. Do you ever get afraid?"" she asked. ""Oh, I guess so. I just don't have time to be afraid most of the time,"" I said with a smile as I drove away."
2,A work of Fiction,"Every read Clancy's _Clear and Present Danger_? This is that, but not as well written. Good for conspiracy buffs."
4,A reader from NY,"This book is a window into a warriors mind and soul. Once I started Bob King's story I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book to anyone that reads with an open mind and seeks the truth. I found Bob King's website Spooky 8 helpful in explaining and confirming his side of this story. If as a reader you can escape from the world you are in, and visualize the world of the author so vividly, as this book does, then the author has been successful in portraying his story. Spooky 8 did that for me. As for the content and fact of his story, we are merely enlightened and further educated. What you choose to believe about a story like this depends solely upon your own level of knowledge of covert operations, take a look around, it isn't to hard to believe. I for one look forward to this authors next mission, be it fact or fiction, Bob King has a talent that is rarely seen."
4,SPOOKY 8 a winner!,"Anytime I read a book without putting it down.....it is a winner. That is the case with Spooky 8. Although Mr. King could not reveal the names of the REAL parties involved to protect himself.... I wished he had done so! Spooky 8 is a fast read....Once you picked it up, it was hard to put down. The book was full of suspense and action. If you like to learn about teams, loyalty, special ops, and what it takes to be a special operator.....read this book.....You will want Mr King to do a follow-up!"
2,Should have been published as fiction!,"This is a passably interesting book, but it should definitely have been published as fiction. King allegedly changed some details in the book--I think that is an understatement! We follow King as he evades an attempt to kill him and his entire team in Colombia. While escaping King coldbloodly kills two Colombian nationals he conned into giving him a ride in their helicopter. Later he finds numerous beautiful women willing to help him, and of course they all find him irresistable and can't wait to bed him! All the while King remarks how he is never able to trust a woman. Please!!! The book would have been much better as a novel, rather than disguised as non-fiction."
5,"Unbelievable, yet Excellent","This non-fiction depicts modern day government the way ""people"" dont want to hear it. But how you and ""I"" want to hear it, the truth. This is easily the best book I've ever read."
1,Disappointing,"I picked up this book in the military history section of the bookstore as this book is being marketed as nonfiction. However, it clearly reads as fiction (and at times is not even original...some scenes appear to be lifted directly from other sources, such as the crash scene in the movie Air America). Is misrepresenting fiction as the truth a new marketing strategy from this publisher? From both a military and a common-sense perspective, this story is implausible. Come on, Mr. King, give us just a shred of evidence that this really happened..."
4,Hard book to put down.,"Stumbled on this book in a book store. Bought it just for something to read but when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. This is a very good book. It really makes you stop and think of the possibilities written about in this book. I for one believe what he writes. I will be looking forward to his next book."
5,When's the movie coming out!,"Of the many books I have read, this is one that really needs to be a movie. This story is a mirror of todays world of politics. It's written with emotion and feeling that makes it truly a believable story. The action is intense and full of twists and turns. For a first time author, King does an outstanding job of telling this story. His writing style is raw and honest, and puts the reader right in the thick of it. I highly suggest this book to anyone who likes action and adventure. I will look forward to his nex book"
2,Does not come with a 50 caliber brush as advertised,"2 biggest brushes in this kit are the 12GA and the .45 caliber. The product description clearly says 50 caliber, works great with my 12 GA but very disappointed I had to buy a 50 caliber brush seperate."
3,A nice kit,"Ok,so I bought into all of the OTIS hype....and it is a good kit. But really you would do better to buy a couple of the brushes and one flexible rod to clean your weapons. The solvents work ok, but Hoppe's seems to work better. It is handy to have when traveling, but I don't think it's worth investing for a home kit."
2,Not worth it,"After hearing so many good things about Otis kits I dropped (the not unsubstantial) $40 on this kit. While it's a good idea, I really don't think it lives up to the hype. The bore cleaning procedure is effective, probably about as good as using a proper rod, brush and jag. But that's about all you can do with this kit. There is no way to clean any complex chamber- the short wire tool is next to useless in an AR chamber. There is no toothbrush, only enough oil for one or two cleanings, and no room to put a good rag in the pouch. After one use I've gone back to keeping a bore-snake, toothbrush, bottle of CLP and rag in my field kit and keeping a proper cleaning kit at home.The Otis kit is not worth the money, or the hype."
4,Small,I have not yet used this on my gun but everything arrived quickly and the kit seems well made. The bore brushes are tight so difficult to get in and out - I even poked myself on one of the brushes. It is a lot smaller than I anticipated. There is no room to fit anything additional so it will be something I simply add to my range bag.
5,Very Complete Kit - Good Compact Size,"This kit is very complete and has everthing needed to clean shotguns, rifles, pistols, you-name-it. I Especially like the compactness."
3,Not for some lever action rifles,"The kit works well enough for a quick, light cleaning job on probably most rifles, pistols, and shotguns. However, I bought this item primarily to clean a Uberti 1873 lever action rifle; once the brush is attached to the cable, the brush/attachment point is too long to fit into the chamber of this rifle, so it is impossible to access the barrel for cleaning."
4,A complete gun cleaning kit,I love this thing! I bought one for my .223 @ Bass Pro Shop and paid to much. Wish I would have look on Amazon first. It's small compact and really does a great job. It took me a few tries to get the cleaning pads on just right but once I did it was smooth sailing from there. Great product!
5,Otis cleaning system is awsome,The Otis cleaning system is so simple and easy to use. Not only is this product better for your firearm but it is alot easier than the traditional ram rod! This is an all around great product that everyone should give a try!
2,over priced,I think that this kit was over priced and contains more than I wanted. I was hard to find a cleaning system description that matched my needs. I compromised and regret doing so.
3,"Works well, but was missing pieces","Showed up without the T-handle, so I'll have to get that separately, but the functionality of the cleaning kit is awesome."
5,As good as I hear it is.,"The design is excellent for compactness and portability yet comprehensive in inclusion. Intuitively usable, though I did read all the instructions (which I recommend - they help with total understanding and were especially useful when I resolved a blockage issue in a rifle barrel). The many provided sizes of brushes and patch holders are marked with large indications of caliber - very helpful when making choice. Easy to use very quickly and I really like the concept - it makes sense, but also provides the ability to do a quick barrel- and exterior-cleaning more frequently as well as a more thorough cleaning with a total break-down of the firearm. I cleaned 3 rifles and 3 pistols consecutively the day I got it and was very pleased at how quickly I was done and even more so because it was a very thorough cleaning of all in much less time than usual."
2,Nice try,"Well guys, you tried to build the better mousetrap and a darn fine job. OOPS, your main beef about the breach to muzzle cleaning just doesnt apply to ""most"" of the firearms as you boast. AND ONE OF THEM IS MINE! FAIL!"
5,Otis Tactical Cleaning System w/ 6 brushes,"Great all around cleaning kit. This product has everything you would need, plus thread connector and a Nato adaptor. It also has 3 flexible cables.."
3,not a good value,The product is much smaller than it looks like on Amazon and is really not a good value for the money. Not all the tools fit in the small carry case.
4,Sure can take a beating,"We have had this for 5 years, and my two boys (and dog) seem to be tough on these plastic toys. Yeah, he does fall over. But the kids (now 5 and 8) figure out how to balance him. His paint is a bit worn, but all his appendages are still attached and he has been buried, biked over, and very well loved. Besides, doesn't everyone need a T-Rex?"
2,Not the same as in the pic,"I am returning this case to Amazon. The one that I received had flimsy clear plastic sleeves inside it. The pic in the ad shows that the interior sleeves have a black background, and are ""double-sided."" I'll pay a little more for the Case Logic brand from Amazon. I just saw a nice CL brand in our local Target store, and Amazon has it for two bucks less, and free shipping!"
3,"Just what I needed but, a lot of work.","I ordered 3 of these at once. I threw away all my CD books and covers for an upcoming move. I went through two boxes in one sitting. It would have gone a lot faster if the plastic inserts has been properly ready for use. There were these little plastic molds that I had to remove myself from each insert. I put my entire library inside a book and a half in one sitting. Having to remove the molds doubled the time and it was very messy. I'm still running into plastic slips that I missed around the house. What a pain. Other than that, it works fine but, it's cheaply made. I don't look forward to putting my DVDs in one of these. Whether or not it will keep the disks safe is another thing. I will update you later."
2,aspartame,"I took this stuff as a kid and it does work if you stay active and lift along with it however when I was younger I never read the lables. I ordered this a few weeks ago and realized it contains aspartame,anyone who does not know what aspartame is needs to look it up. I gave this two stars because it works but will never order it again unless they make a product without aspartame(lab created poison) as a artifical sweetener."
4,Makes great curls,This iron is great for special occasions. It gave my hair that Taylor Swift curl. I just don't recommend using it too often because it does damage your hair.
2,I would have to agree.....,"I would have to agree with the above review. I purchased this iron today and used it as soon as I got home. Curling little sections on the right side of my head worked great, however, the left side gets the dents because the design of the spiral barrel. Still trying to figure it out, but I think it will go back!"
3,Still learning how to use this.,"So I got this product expecting perfect bouncy curls. But apparently its not that easy to achieve. I have really thick difficult to manage hair. I've been playing around with this for about 2 weeks and I think I'm starting to get it. You have to curl the iron in reverse (so instead of inward, you have to do it outwards), at least for me. I still haven't managed to get the curls I want from it. I can only get about half my head done. It does warm up quickly and it does have alot of different heating settings for ally types of hair."
4,A gift,My grnddaughter likes it well enough. It is still new since it was a Christmas gift and she needs to practice with it to get the hang of it.
4,My 11 year old loves this,Great iron for my pre-teen. She had some friends over and they all did spiral curls. Easy to use and it looks good.
4,Works well,I bought this styler for my 13 year old daughter. She likes it and it does a good job. She would had only wished that it didn't have the clip at the end of the wand.
3,So far so good,"Used it last night and it looks like it will require practice before i get the look i'm going for,but i did get some curls. Worth the investment."
5,Amazing!,Ok first of all it is impossible for my hair to hold a curl. I love the curls this iron makes and I did not even have to use a ton of hairspray. the style would have lasted longer if I had used hairspray or something but it works great. The price was great and it got to my house super fast!
1,WORST Curling Iron EVER!!!,"Bought this today and will be returning promptly tomorrow. Do not understand the purpose of the spiral grooves. It is impossible to get your hair exactly between the grooves, so you end up with dents in your curl. Also, you're out of luck if your hair is longer than the length of the barrel, since you can't go back over the barrel and heat some more grooves into your hair. It's also very inconvenient to use if you're right-handed, since you have to align the hair to enter the grooves correctly. Absolutely horrible design! You'll be much better off with a conventional curling iron."
4,Good Product,I have been using ConAir for years and their products have never failed (no matter where I bought them from). This one had the same result. They never fail to impress.
2,hard to use,"I kept burning myself...I found this curling iron very challenging to use. I liked the spiral curls, but find I don't use the device because of the constant burns."
2,"Same as a regular 3/4"" curling iron","First of all, this is tricky to use. Especially if you have short layers. Second of all, the curls I achieved from it, I don't really think are any different than a regular 3/4"" barrell curling iron. The curls weren't all that defined in some spots, and some had a crimping spot from the little clamp. I'd skip it and get a normal curling iron which does the same thing and is easier to use."
2,Maybe it's me....,"I had a hard time using this product. The curls I created looked just like any other curl that I could have made with my regular curling iron. Maybe I just need some practice, but who has time?"
4,Curls!,This product worked nicely to put a curl into my daughter's very straight hair. It looked beautiful when we were done.
5,The perfect gift,Purchased as a gift for my daughter. Perfect for her and her hair style. Easy to handle and use. The .75 diameter was what she wanted.
1,Fell Apart,The retracting mechanism worked fine the speaker buds fell apart and became un-usable after 2 weeks.
1,TERRIBLE,"The item did not come in a package as shown in the picture. Instead, it was wrapped in a baggie. The item was dirty, looked really used, was ripped on one end, and couldn't even be used. I threw it out minutes after receiving it."
3,Eh,"I got this poster today expecting it too be a bit small, however it looks like it was make in someone home. Quality not all that great, design is pretty cool, but overall not too pleased."
3,My review,I would not use as a dryer vent buy something better. I am using as a bathroom vent and had problems with flaps opening. I just loosened the screw a bit. (Mine did not come with screws which I did not understand) Then the flap seemed to work good. Just got it and have not had problem with bee's or bugs yet. If I do it will be gone quick.
1,$7 Bat House,"Earlier this year we spent thousands of dollars doing bat remediation on our home. Since then we've been bat-free. Now we're in the middle of a bathroom remodel and our HVAC guy installed this product in our second story soffit a couple days ago as a vent cover for our exhaust fan. I was concerned when I saw how large the vent holes are in the product since bats can crawl into a space the size of dime. Low and behold, today I noticed a massive amount of bat droppings underneath this vent cover. Which tells me that in spite of the flaps to keep critters out of the duct work, they can climb in and spend the day on the outer part of the vent covers. My concern is what happens when the exhaust fan blows flaps open and one of those winged buggers gets in the duct work.The HVAC guy is going to be coming out to replace this thing asap."
3,Not what i expected,"I was disappointed in the quality of the shower curtain! I was hopping for a solid blend, but it's see through and not pleasant to the touch"
2,Outdated,"I was excited by the description of this book but disappointed by it's contents. The techniques are totally outdated. It goes on at length about analog recording technique which is nearly inapplicable to the beginning composer. Not recommended except as a minor resource for your library. Buy ""The Guide to MIDI Orchestration"" by Gilreath or the Jeff Rona Film Scoring book and the general orchestraion books by Adler and Blatter first."
1,it is not worthwhile to buy,"The only good characteristic is the flashlight. The laser pointer is horrible, weak, and the duration of the battery is very short."
5,most excellent,I found this little jewel quite by suprise and have since shared it both as readings and as gifts. I really appreciate Coleman Barks' translations of Rumi. Enjoy and share!
4,Firefighter Exam,Good book. Even though it's an older edition it still gets the job done. I was able to work with other using this book and there book to study for the exam.
3,No Help !,"I was searching for treats for my male cats who have issues with their urinary tracts. The Vet says stay far, far away from protein which causes crystals to form where they don't belong. I just saw cranberries in the ingredient list on this product and jumped at the chance to be able to hand out treats. So when it got here and I read that it is mostly protein, I can't chance using it. No 'cookies' for my guys. The last vet bill was awful and if I can just keep the cats on the right diet I can buy food for the rest of my family too. So a warning, I guess - if you have male cats who have urinary issues this isn't the right product for you."
5,Thanks so much!,"My cat was having some issues with the litterbox. She ruined both of our bath rugs and several towels. I didn't know what the problem was, and with research discovered she was having a UTI. Many of the reviews stated this product ""healed"" other cats within about 2 weeks, and $6 is cheaper than a $100+ vet bill.Within 2 weeks my cat had no issues using her litterbox and is no longer ruining towels laid on the floor.Thanks so much!"
5,My cats love this!,My cats love these tablets! Very tasty to them! It is highly recommended for cats! This is good for cats who has bladder problems!
4,Cats seem to love this!,"My 3 little cats are almost 3yrs old, but one of them had trouble being able to urinate. We took her to the vet, $400 later, one of the things they recommended were treats with cranberry in it (theirs costing 3x as much as this one). We did x-rays, got antibiotics, and got these from Amazon.She seems to have gotten better, but cannot solely credit these pills. I will keep giving these to them as a preventive measure.The first day I gave these to them, our sick kitten wasn't overly interested in anything but licking them. Once she saw her brother and sister gobble them down, she decided to try them as well. Now all we have to do is shake the container, and they all come running. Our boy cat can finish is within a second of it being placed in front of him!Hopefully this will provide long term kidney support, since I know a lot of cats have kidney issues later in life."
3,My cat would not eat this,"The boy with the urine crystal issues does not like any supplement I have tried on him for his bladder. Was hoping he would go for this one, but no. I will try to find a way to get him to consume this, but it is a total waste of money if I cannot. I was hopeful because other reviewers had cats that would just munch the tablets. *sigh* Just know that picky kitties may not!"
5,He loves it.,"Our cat loves these supplements. After a battle with a nasty UTI, we have been healthy since. We use these for maintenance now. He loves the flavor. He hears the bottle come out of the cabinet and flies in for his vitamin. Before our current residence, he was allowed outside. Now we live near a heavy road and have coyotes, bobcats and owls. He is no longer allowed outside. He spends hours in the window longing for outdoors. Last week he managed to escape. (We have a dog that can open doors when she wants to. She despises the cat so I'm sure it was intentional... Nothing to do with the fact that he used her bed to tell us all he was sick with his UTI. LOL.) We could not find find him and he ignored our calling. I took this bottle of tablets outside and started shaking it as we called for him. He gave up his outdoor adventure for this treat."
5,My cat loves these,"My 6 year old female cat was having a lot of issues with blood in her urine and urinating outside of the little box on walls and on the bathtub. I think that a lot of the problem was due to stress from the other cat living in the house at the time. The other cat has since moved out and the symptoms stopped. I started giving these tablets to her prior to the other cat moving out and still give them to her now. I do think that they are helping. Before the episode of blood in her urine, she used to frequent the little box excessively (every 5 - 10 minutes at times). But after these tables, she has regular visits to the little box. Breaking up the tablets make them easier to eat. And they changed the shape of the tablets making them easier to break up!"
2,Veterinarian's Best Feline Urinary Support Tablets,"I had ordered, what I thought, was the same product as before. Previously, the tablets were larger and could be broken into smaller pieces or my cat could chew them without breaking them up. The tablets I have now are so hard, I have tried soaking them with a small mount off water, but still having a difficult time breaking them up or getting my cat to eat them. I will be looking for another manufactuer when I next order this product."
5,Love,My cat loves these tablets. She eats them before her dinner and breakfast every time. So glad that she enjoys it and it's healthy for her.
5,cat urinary support tablets,My Vet recommended these for my cat. It has worked wonders. He is 17 years old and needs all the help he can get.
5,My cats love these.,"Both of my cats can be pretty picky about their treats, but both of them love these tablets. The only drawback might be breaking the tablets. I have a small mortar and pestle, which works great, but it's probably either that or a pill splitter, because the tablets are a little too big for the cats as is."
2,"urinary tabs, hard to break",Hard to give to cats. Need mortar and pestle to crush tabs and put in cat food. Not easy to break by hand and just give to cats. rejected by cats.
2,Impossible to give this to my cat,The tablets are huge and very hard to use.Cat wanted nothing to do with them.I tried to grind them up but what a disaster that was.
4,Brutal and unflinching,"""Hunger"" is a difficult film to watch. Chronicling the final weeks of the life of Bobby Sands, the IRA activist who, while in prison, embarked on a hunger strike that killed him after 66 days, the film also depicts the brutal conditions endured by Sands and his fellow inmates. The deplorable conditions, merciless beatings, and abject hopelessness are portrayed in a startlingly bleak and powerful manner. Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Sands is utterly remarkable, and the 17-minute scene at the center of the film--in which Sands and his priest discuss the merits of the hunger strike and Sands' motives for going through with it--is both crucial to the plot and a strikingly simple yet bold cinematic gambit that delivers a profound thematic and dramatic punch. Filled with stark images and gut-wrenching performances, ""Hunger"" is a sad and remarkable film."
1,Not good at all,From the great reviews I was expecting this to be an amazing film.There's a 20 minute conversation between 2 men in the middle of the movie.way too long and immediately following that conversation they show a mancleaning for 5 mins really boring. The Hunger Strikes comes all the wayat the end of the movie and it's very short and the only good part of themovie. I will not recommend this movie to anyone.
5,"Well Alright, Already!","I already had a best of Kashif (definitive collection) CD, but I bought this one specifically for the instrumental song ""The Mood."" I had to have it in my collection! I was a high schooler when it originally hit and it was baaaaddd then and still hasn't faded! As another reviewer said: FINALLY!"
2,Short lived batteries,These batteries didn't last as long as norman name brand batteries. My pocket flash light seemed dimmer when I used these.
1,Pure Propaganda!,"Why dont the yeerks get a look in? i am Iniss 126 and i dont see what the ""animorphs"" have against us!however now we now they are human we can soon find them!ha ha ha ha HAA"
4,animorphs books,"My two boys loved this book series as pre-teens and we collected ALL 54 books! They aregreat fantasy and imagination building books.However one book of our books got misplaced. We were afraid we wouldn't be able to replace it, but easilyfound the book we needed on Amazon at a reasonable price. Now our collectionis complete again and ready for the grandchildren!"
5,The Escape,"When Marco and the other Animorphs investigate Visser One's secret underwater project, Marco finds out that his mother is his worst enemy--the leader of the Yeerk invasion of Earth."
5,This is so cool,I havent read this book yet but i know it is going to be the best! I saw someone reading animorphs and saw the cover and thought it was cool so i bought it and now i am hooked!!!
4,This is about the third best Animorph book.,I thought it was very sad when Marco came to his mother and he could not tell her he wasn't a controller. I think this was the saddest in the series so far. An exciting part was when they had the battle with the sharks.
3,Ok,"We were happy with the quality on the first ring we received, However it was the wrong size. So we sent it back and got a smaller size that was too big. Then we sent it back and got a half size bigger and that was too big. By that time we gave up and used masking tape on the ring. The other down size was the enamel on the ring we kept wasn't even filled in all the way. So overall I wasn't that happy. I gave 3 stars because my husband was happy to have it. Also the price was good, but not after sending the ring back so many times."
4,Best book on decks of three I bought,"I have not found a book that covers everything anybody needs to know about decks, but this is the most thorough one I have seen...lots of good pictures. I still don't know how much I should pay for my deck though. I guess I'll have to get multiple quotes from contractors to make sure I'm not overpaying for it."
2,not great,Not a great CD. One or 2 good songs. Don't pay full price. There is some great music in the movie that they did not include!!
1,Trash...,"This album is nothing but rubbish. All it is is a compilation of 12 'popular' tracks, 4 of which do not even feature in the film (tracks 7, 9, 10 & 12). The 'theme music' is nothing but a pathetic Linkin Park sounding cover.And lastly, the original theme music does not even feature on it..."
1,too bad there is no less than one star!,"I just can't understand how it is called the transformers soundtrack! All I can find in it is the songs playing nowadays on the radio! This amazing movie had lots of beautiful music in it that touched the hearts of transformers fans, like the track played when the Autobots arrived to earth, and when they transformed, and more and more!! Im so sure everyone agrees with me except the ones selling this CD!"
1,Didn't recognize any of the songs from the movie on this soundtrack,The only song I recognized from the movie and is theonly song i like on the album was the linkin park song. The remainder songs where not remotely remembered from the film nor where they any good anyhow. Thankfully the score album came (for some reason people don't understand the different between the score album which is the orchestra/instrumental stuff in the movies which is what most people like from the fims and the there are the albums that are like this that are actual songs with lyrics from the movie) out which is such a great album so go get that one and you won't be disappointed like you will be with this one...but for sure download the linkin park sonog because that you will like and recoginize from the end credits of the movie as well as it through out the movie.
3,try it for free,"I own it. Don't listen to track #12. It's so freakin' pathetic piece of Sit. So far I knew only the L.P. song from the album when I got it. Overall I found album to be worth listening to. If you don't know whether to get the album or not, try to listen to songs for free. If you don't care, get the album."
2,Goo Goo Dolls No. 1,"I bought this mainly for the Goo Goo Dolls ""Before It's Too Late and except for Linkin Park, the rest of the Album is too too Heavy Rock for my tastes."
1,Where's the Score music?,"First, most of the songs on this album aren't even in the movie and second, there is none of the score music that was in the movie! It's a good soundtrack if you like these certain songs but I wanted the Score music!"
1,Where's Jablonsky's Score? There'd Better Be A Second Release!,"I don't want the cheesy rock songs I can hear on the radio. Get me Steve Jablonsky's heart-pounding, foot-tapping score! Get it out FAST!"
1,Could've been better.,"Like the songs from Linkin Park and Goo Goo Dolls. Thought the other songs could've been better - a lot better. Especially the Transformes theme song. I do not like this version at all. The version by Lion on the original animated movie is much better.Also much better, and a more recent version, is a version of the song done by Black Lab. This should've been on the album and would've been good for the closing credits of the movie as well. [...] and you can hear their version (and see some YouTube videos of the song).I, too, hope an orchestral soundtrack of the movie comes out."
3,Eh.,"Was hoping for the SCORE to this movie. Didn't realize this album was just the pop music used in a few scenes from the movie. While my son enjoys it mostly, TRACK 8 IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN, what he really wanted was the soundtrack. I purchased this CD not knowing that the score album is rare, hard to get hold of and very expensive. We were rather disappointed with this."
1,Non-Transformers,"I was very disappointed that the Soundtrack and Score were sooo different, maybe it's time to come out with a soundtrack that goes with the movie. We are dedicated Transformers viewers and would like the great music to be available to us."
1,Buy this album if you like wasting money.,"Transformers the movie was one of the best movies i've seen in a very long time partly because the scoe was so immersive and really tugged at your emotions. As you can probarbly guess i went out and bought the Soundtrack however when i listened to the songs on the cd i couldn't remember hearing them in the actual film. None of the great pieces of music composed by Steve Joblonsky where featured in the soundtrack, instead the cd was made up of mediocre songs from bands i'd never heard of before. I strongly suggest leaving this soundtrack alone for it's a great waste of money."
2,I'm wondering the same thing...,"Where's the score?Seriously, the only thing I was thinking to myself as I left the theater was: Must obtain score. I go look for it and what do I find? No score. It's not that I don't like the songs on the soundtrack, I'm just thouroughly disappointed that the score isn't availible, because it was one of the better scores I've heard in a while. Grand and epic, but still melodic and elegant, it was just perfect."
1,Where's the real score?,"I went to see Transformers last night in the theatre and was all excited about finding the soundtrack online today. What a disappointment! The fantastic musical score isn't even on this ""soundtrack"". That's what I wanted to buy!"
1,I Found the Real Origional Soundtrack,"O.k. folks, I am a serious movie soundtrack person and I did some research and I have not gotten it yet but the real soundtrack has the cartoon on the cover. It is also dated 2007 and is called Original Soundtrack ""Extra Tracks"" All of the reviews for that one say that its ""choice!"" so I assume it's the one with the actual movie scores. In my many years of collecting soundtracks I have learned this....always look for the soundtracks that have ""Original"" in the title. Excuse my spelling. The other albums that just say ""soundtrack"" have the ""songs insspired by"" and very few of the actual movie scores. I hope this helps, rock on fellow movie goers!"
3,Piece of crap other than The Goo Goo Dolls song.,"Look at the soundtrack to the 1986 movie:LOTS of classic cuts, especially the Stan Bush songs and the score tracks by Vince DiCola. An all-time classic when it comes to soundtracks! Now let's look at this one:Only ONE good song, ""Before It's Too Late"" by The Goo Goo Dolls, a great song, but the rest of the songs are by crappy bands like Taking Back Sunday, Disturbed and Linkin Park."
1,Where are the songs that were actually *used in* the movie?,"Where's ""Sexual Healing?"" Where's ""Who's Gonna Drive You Home Tonight?"" Where's any of the other million songs that were actually used in the film?They're not on this crap CD, which is full of ""not in film"" garbage. What a joke! I'm glad Target had this for only $9.99, which is still too much.Hopefully the ""score"" album is much better. It can't be any worse."
3,"Good, but where's the score?","I like pretty much all of these bands (except a few) and the songs are good, but I was really looking forward to the actual SCORE from the movie. All these songs (except maybe the Mutemath one) are most likely available on the the band's albums, some of which I already have. I mostly got this CD for the new HIM song, which isn't available anywhere else yet. The songs themselves were good, but I don't feel they really contributed much to the movie. The score itself was much more impressive, and should be available. This album is very good in and of itself, but I would be nice to have the score released as another, separate album. Together, the two would make an excellent combination."
1,No score?,"Who gives two craps about the music ""inspired"" by the movie? Jablonsky's score was the inspiring music, so where is it?"
3,Just falls short,"I give this three stars soley on the new track from disturbed ""this moment"", but I am Highly dissapointed. The track By mutemath is decent also, with the transformer theme, but it's still weak. They pulled from albums released at the same time as this soundtrack, or shortly there after, no effort towards originality, or delayed pleasure at least (let the track come out 6 months later on the bands album). Plus, this just does not fit the flow/power of the movie. The score is much better in all truths. Save your money unless you are a collector of disturbed or like compilations."
1,Wait for Jablonsky's score,"This album is nothing more than a collection of pop/rock songs - most of which weren't even in the movie. It's only worth it if you download the torrent, don't pay for it,I will however be the first in line to hand over my hard earned dollars for Steve Jablonsky's Transformers score - if they ever release it."
4,Some Pretty Good Stuff,"I picked up the Transformers soundtrack after watching the movie a couple of times. I liked some of the hard hitting guitar riffs and vocals. There are a couple of really good tracks on this CD, and listening to them brings back some of the mental images of the movie. My favorite track is ""Pretty Handsome Awkward"" by The Used. Heavy punch! I am not a real fan of toy robots, but I did find the movie to be good mindless entertainment with alot of good action (and Megan Fox was certainly worth watching!). This CD is worth a try."
3,The problem with this compilation,"As most people have noted already, a large problem with this collection of music is that the beautiful score of Steve Jablonsky has been mostly omitted. That is a problem, but not a problem for this CD.This disc is an OST, an original sound track, not meant to be a score disc. But, being an ORIGINAL sound track implies that the disc contains music from the movie. But of course, with ""(Not in Film)"" tags by practically every song in the listing, that obviously is the main problem with this CD.What I do like about it is that the makers of this compilation included NEW music. This music is music that is nowhere else but on this CD. However, the new music on this disc is very diverse. Luckily, I like the Goo Goo Dolls and Disturbed, but I'm unique. Finding this new Disturbed song isn't worth buying the CD filled with alternative and pop. That is the real problem for most people, not that this disc left out music that wasn't supposed to be on the disc anyway."
3,Good Mix - but where are the orchestration pieces,"I enjoyed the movie and the soundtrack was very good also, but I expected and wanted to hear the orchestra movements from the movie. The pieces played during the battle scenes were phenomenal and the action of the movie was spectacular - here is hoping that they release the Orchestra pieces on a separate album."
1,bad let down,"Yup, I'm with the majority of one star reviews. Bought the CD thinking it was the actual sound track but was sadly disappointed with the contents. Looks like the producers were the ""decepticons"" during this project. How can they call it a movie sound track when two of the listed songs weren't even used in the movie. Bogus to say the least. A waste of good money."
1,These songs have nothing to do with the movie at all....,I think I remember 3 rock songs in it. Please release the true music that Steve Jablonsky wrote that the was the reason for movie doing so well. This soundtrack is an insult to someone that is really responsible for the mood of the movie. The music director that put this out sucks as much as this unnecessary album.
4,"good saw, good price","Don't know much about woodworking, still learning here. I bought this saw to help clear waste wood from dovetails and the saw works beautifully for that purpose. I'm sure most here will know this, but the saw is a pull saw, so the blade is thin and delicate and only cuts on the pull stroke, similar to a dozuki. The saw fits well in the hand, relatively well made (just cut my first set of dovetails with this saw last weekend and had a blast....cut my time in half!), and the blade is sharp. I noticed that the blade is designed to rotate so that one can cut in an arbitrary orientation, but on my particular tool it was hard to rotate the blade. This wasn't a big problem for me, however, as I just planned ahead and cut in smooth curves rather than trying to cut at hard angles.All in all, solid saw for the price, but perhaps the more skilled woodworkers who need to make difficult hard angle cuts will find this particular saw lacking."
4,"Nice feel, good quality",This saw is what you would expect. I purchased a set of extra thin kerf blades at a local hardware store to cope a complex baseboard profile. These blades + a small rasp did the trick for an extra few bucks.
3,ok,"Not worth what I paid for it. Handle is not the best, you need to hold the pins while tightening to keep the blade strait."
1,Received blades but no saw,I paid for the Robert Lawson Coping Saw and received only coping saw blades. Obviously this was disappointing. I would not recommend buying this here unless you dont want what you paid for.
4,"Not bad, not great",There are some song collections that is loved the first time you hear it. This one only made me like it.
3,Mastering JavaServer Faces,Good outline of JavaServer Faces but not enough examples. Too much theory not enough practical examples. It is not a complete reference so you need other books or sources to get answers on specific functions and uses of JavaServer Faces.
3,Whither hello world?,"If you are like me, you don't have the time to read about the philosophy behind the design of JSF or how it's more like swing than struts. Why can't the authors of such books start with a hello world example. Most experienced programmers can figure out the basics of JSF just by looking at the hello world example and relating it to technologies they've already used(struts, perhaps?). Most authors can't resist the temptation to impress us with the awesome power of the new framework especially when they haven't introduced the basic examples? Why have a whole chapter explaining the intricacies of faces-config.xml before you really introduce a simple application? I got more out of http://www.jsftutorials.net than the first few chapters of this book. Get eclipse wtp, install the jsf plugin and go through the tutorial."
2,"Could be a 5 star book, but missing an important piece","This book reads very well. Explains most things very clearly but the examples are missing what to put into the faces-config.xml file. Ch. 5, Ch 6, ... have some nice examples and show you what goes in the jsp files but as you add to these jsp files you need to make the necessary adjustments to the faces-config.xml file too. You have to download the source to see the contents of the faces-config.xml file.As a beginner, I found this very frustrating and out searching the net for more tutorials that show how to make adjustments to the faces-config.xml and the JSP file.Other than this issue, the book is good the learning about the JSP/JSF contents.It is just disappointing that this book was so close, if it had covered the faces-config.xml I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Not to be used as an introduction into JSF,"If you are new to JSF, this is not the first place to go searching-this book clearly does not use the hello world (learning) pattern to introduce you to this technology. You could get frustrated with the first 3 chapters especially if you do not have any swing or struts knowledge.That said, this book is without any doubt rich in content.If you already have had hands on experience in JSF and are intending to go a mile further, following the writers wouldn't be difficult.The first few chapters are however more explanatory than example oriented."
4,A must read for any Trader,This book is one of those books which is a must read for a Trader to be successful. It is more useful for those who want and operate in global markets and not just plain equity. It also analyses the major events and discloses the facts which most media missed but was crucial to the risk taken by the particular trader.
3,"great writing, so-so pictures","Reeve Lindbergh has thoughtfully rewritten Saint Francis' Canticle of the Sun for the enjoyment of younger readers. Her tribute to the original keeps the feeling and simplicity while making it accessible to modern readers. The collage illustrations are dull, static and cluttered rather than bright and three-dimensional. The bright cover, one hopes, will attract readers of all ages to this beautiful celebration of our natural world."
4,Inspirational work,The Circle of Days is a short work beautifully illustrated. It can be read by either adults or children and we have made it part of our daily blessing for each meal.
4,"One good song, but good enough to make it worth it","I heard this CD's Galapagos track on a label sampler, and thought it was good enough that the CD would be amazing. It wasn't, but having that one track alone makes it worth it. What a great song!"
2,Disc scratched,"The movie was good but disc halted several times in ""attempt to read"" indication which started midway into the movie"
2,Didn't last long,"Bought these for my husband , he had this brand before and they lasted a long time.But the ones I purchased on Amazon seemed cheaper made and not as good quality.Don't know what happened there."
2,please read the first comment and this comment before buy,the match with mine had a little piece of wood hanging of and when i finished doing the trick and pull the match of two strings broke. so i used my own match and more broke now im to the point where i only have two strings. dont buy this product please NOT WORTH THE MONEY
1,Music Not Inspired by Lord of the Rings,"This CD purports to be a collection of songs inspired by The Lord of the Rings, but if one turns to the back cover, one may see that the music is made up of tracks previously released on Rick Wakeman's Heritage Suite and The Seven Wonders of the World. These songs, then, are obviously NOT inspired by Lord of the Rings but have simply been retitled (incorrectly in the case of Minas Tirith which has here been called Minas Truth) with names from Tolkien's triolgy. While it is interesting to listen to these old songs in their new conceptual connotations, this is still old material, and the musical styles of the original two albums don't always blend as nicely as one might hope. One would do far better to purchase both Seven Wonders and Heritage Suite and experience the songs in their proper form."
5,"If you love music, this is it.","I was drawn to this cd as a fan of Rick Wakeman and the Lord of the Rings books. Anyone who is a fan of fine instrumentals and some fabulous piano playing should really check this one out. Many of the tracks have appeared on previous Wakeman collections, but they all seem to fit very, very well. Lothlorien, Rohan and the Grey Havens have some of Wakeman's best piano playing. The music is as relaxing as it is inspiring. It makes me want to start playing the piano again."
2,Not from Lord of the Rings,"The music is not like lord of the rings style, is more like new age, if you search someting like lord of the rings don't buy it, the music is nice to relax in your house."
4,INTERESTING INTERPERTATION......,"I MUST ADMIT TO TWO THINGS RIGHT OFF THE BAT-ONE I DON'T CARE FOR PIANO MUSIC VERY MUCH, AND TWO, I AM CRAZY ABOUT DAVID ARKENSTONE'S MUSIC. THAT SAID I MUST SAY THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING INTERPERTATION OF THE MUSIC OF MIDDLE EARTH. I LIKED THIS ""MODERN"" VIEW OF THE MIDDLE EARTH MUSIC.IN ALL FAIRNESS IF ONE WANTS MUSIC THEY FEEL IS RIGHT OUT OF MIDDLE EARTH ONE SHOULD HEAR DAVID ARKENSTONE'S MUSIC INSPIRED BY MIDDLE EARTH. IT IS MORE CELTIC WITH A NEW AGE HINT. BUT IT STICKS WITH WHAT YOU WOULD THINK MIDDLE EARTH MUSIC WOULD SOUND LIKE, EVEN THOUGH NONE OF US HAS EVER BEEN TO MIDDLE EARTH.I FEEL JACKSON WOULD HAVE HAD MOVIES OF A RICHER AND MORE FULLFILLING NATURE HAD HE USED DAVID AND HIS GENIUS AT STORYTELLING WITH MUSIC.BUT ALL SAID I STILL RECOMMEND THIS AS ONE OF MANY INTERPRETATIONS OF GOOD MUSIC. I THINK I HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF THE MIDDLE EARTH AND LORD OF THE RINGS MUSIC ON THE MARKET. SOME 15 DIFFERENT CDS. SOME GREAT SOME VERY POOR."
4,Pure Poncho!,"A new release by Poncho Sanchez is always a pleasant surprise. On the one hand, Poncho plays what I like to call, fundamental Latin-Jazz. However, Poncho always manages to come up with a few new surprises (and guests) along the way.On SOUL OF THE CONGA we experience a little ""Changui tipico"" from Cuba with Poncho and the Ortiz Brothers. Next, some Latin-Jazz with special guest, Joey De Francesco and his Hammond B-3 Organ.In my opinion, the only other musician that could hold his own in a Latin setting was the late, great Charlie Palmieri. However, Joey De Francesco does an admirable job of adding a new element to the music without overpowering the rest of the band.Poncho has matured as a band leader since his apprenticeship with the late master of the vibraphone, Cal Tjader.I really enjoyed this CD and highly recommend it. Thank You Poncho for keeping it real!"
3,Works as advertised,"after breaking my favorite one ear/mic combo.. these were the only avail item that wasn't huge..I like to travel with my earphones so size does matter....They work ok, sound is decent etc I just find it awkward and often have to fight with the retracting spring....both ends must be pulled evenly etc for it to work right...It works... It was cheap so I am not unhappy but it is not the best solution on the market."
2,Not worth the price,"I agree with other reviewers who have said that this book lacks issue for developers. The examples, and diagrams, are absolutely atrocious. In addition, I don't think that it offers a decent overview of CORBA. Indeed, the information is all there (that is, overview info), but it is embedded in a dry, repetitive, and big-worded style. Also, I wish that writers would someday learn what a split infinitive is, in order for them __to hopefully stop__ using them all the time!Some good titles coming out soon. Let's hope.-Nathan"
3,"Good overview, in content not style.","This is a good book for a broad overview. Essentially, it is an executive summary in book form. The content is complete and useful, but the style is dry and the presentation uninspired. This is the bran-flakes of CORBA: good for you, but not particularly enjoyable. It is also almost useless for developers (but it doesn't seem to be targeted towards them either)."
4,Little piece of the tropics in your teacup,"Picked this up after enjoying a cup of coconut tea at a local Thai restaurant. This one is nice, pretty coconutty, but not too much so, but the black tea in it does get bitter pretty quickly, so make sure you set a timer for 3 minutes so you don't walk away and forget. Doesn't need much sugar but a little helps boost the coconut taste. I find honey distracts from the subtle flavors in this tea."
5,very yummy,"i was really worried that the coconut was going to be over powering, but to my amazement it wasnt. it brew up so perfectly with the black tea. i was astonished on how well these two worked so well with each other! i'm back ordering a few more for xmas gifts! comes in a beautiful canister too!"
2,Not large,"I don't know what they used to measure the main compartment dimensions, but it wasn't a standard ruler. I wasn't even close to the size it was suppose to be. I returned the item and went to Best Buy."
3,Difficult Time,"I am an avid reader, slicing through a book a week. I picked this book up twice and didn't finish it, making it the second book in my history of reading that I have not finished. Perhaps I will try it again.I found it hard to get into. So much was thrown at me all at once. I found it confusing and hard to create images on so much that was unfamiliar to me. I give it three stars because I think it is unfair to give anything lower on a book that I haven't finished. But I am unsatisfied with what I did read."
5,I hated to see this book come to an end,"Like a deeply satisfying meal, the taste of this book lingered long after it ended. Ms. Reichl's portrayal of the people in her life was done with love and forgiveness. Her humor and warmth made this a book I will read again - only more slowly!"
4,The book kept novice reader very interested and entertained.,"Only having recently begun to read, I thoroughly enjoyed this book - at least once I got past the first chapter, which seemed slow. Perhaps it was because I grew up in the same time as that described in the book; or maybe because of the delightful descriptions of the circumstances encountered throughout; but whatever the reason, I did not want the story to end. I can only thank Ruth Reichl for sharing part of her life with us."
2,"Has its moments, although...","First of all, don't buy this book for the recipes. They seem to be included to give the feel of the period, and aren't very interesting today. That said, there are some worthwhile passages in this book, notably those that involve the author's bipolar mother. The problem is that the bulk of the memoir is larded with boomer-generation cliches: the motherly housekeeper, the exotic boarding school roommate, the high school 'fast crowd,' the exotic college roommate, the post-college communal household. One cringe-worthy chapter in the middle is reminiscent of Neal Pollack's ""I am friends with a middle-class black person""--minus the satire. Finally, at the end, things just begin to get interesting as the author visits French vintners in the company of Kermit Lynch. Perhaps the sequel is a better read. For a far superior coming-of-age-with-food read, try Nigel Slater's ""Toast."" It succeeds more effectively on every level--and all he had to work with was British food!"
2,Character development lacking,"Disjointed, doesn't develop characters well. She had experiences and people who could have been richly developed in her storyline, but opted instead to make this a ""Foodie's"" travel guide. If it wasn't a book selected for review at next meeting by my book club, I wouldn't have read to the end."
1,who cares!,"This was chosen by our reading group, and our universal opinion was ""Why did anyone encourage this woman to write a book of her life?"" Boring, pointless, unresolved. Except for the recipes, there is no 'meat' in this memoir. If you're in the mood to read a memoir that will give you food for thought, try All Over But The Shoutin' by Rick Bragg, An Unquiet Mind by Kay Jamison, The Diving Bell And The Butterfly by Jean Bauby."
2,A Bit Sordid,"I'm not much interested in the sordid details of her life, her mother's, or her friend's. I must have mistaken this for a cooking essay book. Granted, she throws in recipes along the way."
4,Wonderful!,"I found this book moving, entertaining and down right funny! I loved strolling down ""food"" memory lane with her. Try the Art Park brownies!! They are delicious."
4,YUM!,This book is a must for people who share the belief that eating is not a biological necessity but rather one of life's great adventures. Ruth Reichl has enriched the life of many with her superb reviews. Now she has added courage and generosity to her work by sharing some of the experiences that formed her. It was a joy to share her physical and psychological journeys. I will continue to emulate her zest for life and food!
3,tasty and tender,I liked this book. Really enjoyed it. I picked it up at a used book store for a couple of bucks. I am a memoir junkie. It didn't like it quite as much as Apron Anxiety which I just read. But it's pretty good. I suppose a tad slow moving and redundant at times and something about it seems unfinished.. a lot of unanswered questions. But still an enjoyable read and the recipes were icing on the devil's food cake.
3,Tender at the Bone,"It was a fairly interesting book; however, if I wanted recipes I would read a cook book. The characters were sketched out well."
3,A sometimes moving memory of family and food,"This beautifully written account of Ruth Reichl's warm relationship with food, is peppered with moving anectdotes about her mother and the education of one of the most influential food critics in modern times. Unfortunately, the portraits of the most important men in her life( father, husband) is sketchy and guarded. Maybe now that Ms. Reichl doesn't have to hide her identity anymore, she will write a second volume that is not as muted."
2,"Okay, but...","I thought that this book was an okay read, but it left quite a lot to be desired. The author's life story was, for me, a not particularly interesting one (except for the havoc wrecked by author's manic/depressive mother and passive/enabling father). Reichl's ponderous writing style ruined many a good scene. Her annoying use of passive verbs (i.e. ""I could see,"" ""I could smell,"" ""He seemed to be,"" etc.) slowed things down considerably. More aggravating, Reichl skips over some lucious details of her cooking apprenticship--she learns to cook such-and-such and it turns out delicious. Boom, just like that, with no description of technique or trial-by-error or any of those pesky things that home cooks (and probably professionals, as well) have to deal with on the road to a perfect souffle or divine roast.So, all in all, if a reader is seeking a combined autobiography/cookbook, there are better choices than ""Tender at the Bone."""
2,"Great food critic, lousy biographer","I've always enjoyed Reichl's NY Times food reviews - they're quick, factual and accurate. The skills that she uses so well in her food columns just don't translate well into a personal biography. The writing drags on and on -I felt as if I were reading an adolescent's 'woe is me' diary. I couldn't even bring myself to finish the book and quit 2/3 of the way through."
2,Bits of Entertainment,"If you are looking for a book focused on food and cooking, this is not it. And perhaps this was not Reichl's intention in the first place. It is really an account of her upbringing and coming into her own...worth the read due to bits of entertaining writing, but more on the side of an autobiography than pure Food Lit."
2,No point...,"I was disappointed. This book is just a book about Ruth Reichl's life before becoming a famous NYT food critic. The problem is that there is absolutely nothing to say!You would expect a book to make you either dream, travel, think, laugh or anything, even scare you, why not? But in this book, you will have nothing except for a completely normal life with nothing special about it. It was a very flat and pointless read.I guess the book is worth it when you really want to know about the author, then you probably have some answers, but if you are looking for a good read about food, nothing here, a good read with an interesting point of view on things, or a thrilling biography... dont pick out this book!"
2,Memoir of a former hippie with a mother complex,"After enjoying the author's witty restaurant reviews, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Aside from some wonderful descriptions (particularly ""the old, cold taste of olives""), this book is rife with '60s flower child attitude. Mostly tiresome and definitely cliche (all RIGHT, we get the idea the author isn't racially biased), the post-mortem attacks on the author's mother seem unnecessary and distracting. I'll stick with M.F.K. Fischer."
1,Unlistenable sound disqualifies a striking performance,"Everyone in the cast of this 1962 Covent Garden performance who is well known, principally Cesare Siepi as the Don and Mirella Freni as Zerlina, can be found on commercial recordings. Solti had a great run at Covent Garden, and I'd like to have heard his interpretation, but the sonics make that impossible. This is a scratchy, murky, distant home recording that would have been a disgrace in 1922, much less 1962. In lieu of Amazon providing any audio samples, be warned."
3,"Refills OE blades, not OEM style","If you want a blade refill that will fit your blade, this might be the one. It can be adapted to fit a number of different OE blades.I was disappointed because I expected it to be the equivalent of what I was replacing, which had twin metal rails. This one has a plastic universal spine. To me, ""OE refill"" implies that it is the refill that came as OE equipment, not a different style that happens to fit. Whenever I got refills in the past, they matched the type that was in the original blade.I ended up returning this and getting a competing brand that truly was an exact replacement. It was a much better fit. If you use a refill that was like the original, you can expect it to sit the same and performance should be closer.The refill, not the pictured blade, is what you get when you buy this. If you have the blade pictured, perhaps this is the ideal refill."
2,Not much help.,"Unfortunatly, for those who are attempting to go to medical school, this book will not be much help. I found it to be extremely general and any information present in this book you either already know, or is completely useless."
4,Good Preparation,This has all of the information needed to apply and become accepted at the medical school of your choice.
5,"A fun, readable introduction to a strange animal","My daughter is a younger than the age group specified, but she loves the story and the pictures -- as do I, the parent who has to read it a million times in a row. *grin* Fortunately for me, the delightful and informative text holds up to repeated readings aloud, and although the book is nonfiction, there's a nice narrative flow that pulls the reader into the life of the platypus. Both enjoyable and educational!"
4,This is a fun dog,"I have this dog in the white color for my kids, they do like it but the things I don't like are that the string is to short for a three year old to really pull w/o having to bend down. And usually when they walk with it, it just ends up getting dragged. But it is cute and they like to have a dog, it has held up well to being thrown around and I recommend it."
2,Better pull toys out there,"I just purchased this toy based on the good reviews I read, but was a bit dissappointed when I received it. I got the Quack Along Ducks also for my twins, and that one is much better. The dog doesn't even bark as advertised, it only makes a clicking sound. I am returning it tomorrow."
4,string too short,"maybe my kids are too tall, but they can't walk and pull this at the same time, but cute toy"
1,missing deflectors,"I ordered my Weathertech 81426 deflectors hoping to put them on as soon i got them. But only the two rear ones were in the box, so i have to wait now. Since i dont know how long it will take to get them, I'm very mad."
2,Save your money.,"This version of Summer Days (And Summer Nights) called California Girls has inferior sound to two later versions of the CD; one released just this week that includes the album in BOTH stereo and mono songs. The other version is a two-fer that has The Beach Boys Today coupled with it. It is not clear whether the latter of these two will remain in the EMI/Capitol catalog now that the new release is available, but it is the BEST VALUE of the versions I have or have sampled. You will find it here:Today/Summer Days & Summer Nights (+B-Sides)"
3,Not sure about this release,"It's not the original versions, yet it isn't live. I'm not really sure about this one. If anyone has details on it, please share them so we'll all know more."
5,Useful guide to law school admittance,"I thought this was an extremely helpful guide during my law school admissions process. I received quite a few tips on narrowing down my selections, essays and other factors involved in the process. In the end it's GPA and LSAT that matter most, but this guide will definitely give you a bit of an edge."
2,Not applicable in New York....,"The book, while succeeding in getting you into a ""Taking the test"" mindset, failed in applicability here in NY state. The civil service test here bore no resemblence to the types of test questions or format as presented in the book. Other texts for specific careers, such as police or firefighter, have been far better in my experince in being pertinent to the topic, some had even had questions almost identical to the test I took."
4,civil service clerical exams,"It's great to study for exam. answer explanations for test is the most convenience part to study. seller for this book is great. condition of this book is exactly same as new. great price, great condition. thank you seller."
1,Gift for Granddaughter that did not work,"I bought the Off the Map Zoom Cam for my granddaughter for her graduation from pre-school. When it was opened, my son tried to load the film in the camera and it would not take the film. Her other grandfather, a trained photographer, could not get it to work either. I am returning it to the store here in Savannah and hope another one will work. I was extrememly disappointed. Guess it goes to show, when you do not buy a name brand item with a proven track record, this is what can happen. Not Toys R Us'fault. It is faulty merchandise from Wild Planet."
5,Solid Guidance on Leadership Skills,"This is a delightful little book that provides a quick and useful reference guide on how to improve your leadership skills and capabilities. I have read a lot of books on leadership but reading is not enough. Some fundamentals have to be constantly reinforced. John Adair presents a well written, easy to read book that is fun to read and yet packed with a lot of commonsense practical ideas that can help anyone improve their leadership skills.The book will reinforce your commitment to fundamental leadership skills. Sometimes you just have to read something one more time to make it stick. I especially appreciate his down-to-earth advice and views on leadership which are drawn from his own wide extensive military, business, and academic backgrounds and experience as well as sharp intellect.John Adair's 100 Greatest Leadership Ideas fits the bill. Definitely worth reading."
5,Counting book for young kids- good one!,"This is a great counting book for young kids. You count the smiley lions friends, and learn the names of animals at the same time. It's a typical counting book, but with colorful pics, and a creative binding."
3,Just bought a NX70V...,"I installed a G2 screen protector from pdascreenprotectors.com yesterday when I got my new NX70V and it's great, barely noticable, almost no effect on the pressure neededon the digitizer. I don't have any association with them, but I'd recommend their product to anyone and they had good customer service when I had a question."
3,A Hardcore Computer Science Dictionary,"The format of this book is excellent. Words are easy to look up and everything is referenced nicely. However, the choice of words were not quite what I expected from the title. I think the book was a little heavy on the data-processing and hardware terms. If you are looking for a dictionary to help you read Japanese software documentation or use Japanese software. However, I feel that this book would be a useful addition to any technical translators library."
2,The Atomic Bore,"This early 1960s black and white ""horror"" film is a prime example of the misunderstood evil genius-reanimated zombie genre typical of the era. The distinguishing features of this film are the extremely disagreeable spinster and the outlandishly bad acting, particularly of the three female victims. (I am especially fond of their skillfully crafted foreign accents.)This one has it all: ornery old woman, evil genius, hokey pseudo-scientific sets and dialogue, wooden acting, and a cat brain transplanted into a nubile young girl. The one unifying theme of the film, however, is that of boredom. The film isn't one of the very worst ever made, but it ranks right up there on the all time boringness scale. I recommend that if you want to watch this film you buy the version featuring the MST3K guys and their trademark mockery: it relieves the boredom and makes the viewing experience infinitely more enjoyable!"
2,Doesn't work for acne or scars,"Sorry to say but I origionally bought for acne and scars, it does not work for either. I would probably work for cuts and scrapes but havent tried for this to say if it worked. The thing i hate about this is it stains clothing and anything else it comes in contact with."
1,Very Smelly,"I bought this based on a Woman's Day article that said it was good for wrinkles. This product is very pungent and it also makes the skin turn dark brown wherever you put it. When it dried, it made my skin feel extremely dry. Maybe it is good for some use, but I would not recommend buying it to treat wrinkles."
4,Great story,This is my first story by Me Coble. I loved the mystery of trying to figure out what would happen next. I'm looking forward to the rest of her stories.
5,Great book,I really enjoyed reading this book. It keeps you interested from start to finish! I really like that she can keep you guessing about the outcome.
2,Disappointed,"Colleen Coble is my favorite author, but I almost wonder if something awful was happening in her life when she wrote this series. Everybody's dead or dying or abusive or two-faced... that poor girl goes through so much and Rand is a complete jackass through most of the story, I was left wondering why she kept chasing him halfway across the country.I love Colleen Coble, but this just didn't seem like her at all. While everything ended happy, I was not altogether thrilled that she ended up with a guy as tempermental as Rand.If you think this is going to be of the same quality as Coble's ""Mercy Falls"" series, you are going to be in for quite a disappointing surprise."
3,Good read,Overall a good read. Think there could have been more the story but enjoyed the book and will look for more by Collen Coble.
1,Don't bother,I bought this for my son when he was 2. He has always loved taking baths until recently. I thought this toy seemed interesting enough for him to want to play with in the tub. After reading other reviews I was sure this was the toy...boy was I wrong. He has absolutely no interest in this toy whatsoever. He won't even play with the whistle. He would rather play with plastic cups. I would say this might possibly interest a younger child.
4,Good Deal,"Okay - people who buy two year old toys for their eight month old baby and complain the parts are too small... humm. I bought this for my two year old daughter for bath play. It's fun. Simply there are 365 baths this year. The foam animals, numbers, letters, etc. are okay, but I need something to play with. This toy fits the bill. Sometime they're pirates on the spanish main. Other times they are the three of us on the a beach on St. Marteen. Bottom line the toy is well made and my daughter enjoys splashing around with the parts."
2,"Okay, but nothing that special","I purchased this toy for my 8 month old and really was not that impressed with it. Maybe he is just too young. Some of my dislikes were how small the animals are. Of course everything goes into my little guys mouth and these do too -- except too far into his mouth. My rule has always been 'no toys that will not fit though the carboard of a tiolet paper roll."" And this one breaks that rule. Also, the container does not float very well. The yellow section does fill up with water and therefore can mold.On the pro side, it is great colors....that is not a lot of pros for a toy!Pass on this one parents. There is much better stuff out there -- Sassy is my favorite."
3,It's OK,"This toy is cute, but I did find that the little men had screws in them that eventually rusted. I was concerned about that, so I had to throw away the tops of the men and just keep the bottoms. My son still plays with the boat, sail and bottoms of the men (we've had the toy for about 2 years). To keep the toys from rusting, you should probably dry it off after bathtime."
3,A bit disappointed,"Generally speaking- a nice looking everyday watch- but I did think it was going to have more diamonds/sparkle, so I was a little disappointed. There is 3 REALLY TINY diamonds on each side of the face- embedded in metal thats supposed to simulate diamond but doesnt really. There is minimal sparkle."
2,BROKEN,"Five out of the twelve key chains were broken, i.e., the chicken was separated from the chain! I was very disappointed. I had purchased these for gag gifts for work and now I do not have enough."
2,Not my taste,"I was looking for a more balanced view of different places and things to do and see but this was for the more adventurous at heart. Did not like it. Not enough variety. Quality was OK, though."
3,book,"It was in ok shape, it had a huge stain on all the edges of the book and it didn't state that but it's still readable. It got here quickly though."
3,Her Name is Woman: Book 2,"This is an old book, published in 1977. My Bible Study group was looking for a study on women of the Bible and this is one that someone had from many years ago. It is a worthwhile study even though it it dated and some ideas are no longer in vogue. As with any study, you read the scripture and the author's comments and then make your own determinations."
2,my opinion,"This is the same laughing bag I had 30 years ago. I mean it's the SAME scratchy recording too. Way too expensive, still a good laugh, should be better, only one out there."
2,Just doesn't do it....,"I'm a big Stephane Pompougnac fan, and when I started looking around some of amazon's recommended artists, I came across a whole article on lounge/after hours music, with this CD at the top of its list, so it looked promising. I tried it and found the loops are waaaaay too repetitive, and there is no musical skill here at all; everything is rhythm. I will say disc 2 is better than disc 1. If you sample this album and don't like it much either, try Hotel Costes 4 and 5 for smooth, cool European tones."
5,Saved me from long checkout line meltdowns!,"A friend gave this to me because her little ones liked it so much. My son is 9 months old and is probably finally starting to get bored with it, but I carried it in my diaper bag (the slim shape is great for this) since he was able to grasp and hold (around 3 months) and he has LOVED it! It seems like the simplest thing, but I think he enjoys watching the smiling faces go around on the bright background. The rotating gears fascinate him, and he'll manipulate it for a good long time, long enough for me to finish shopping when he's starting to get antsy. I get way more mileage out of this than any other diaper bag toy (rattles, keys, etc.), and of course he played with it inside the house too, but I soon decided to save it just for trips out to keep his interest fresher longer."
4,Great Epic,"John Jakes has done it again with another great historical epic. The writing and images put the reader in that era. I felt like a part of the Crown family. It was a long book, but I could not put it down!"
5,"If you start this book, you won't be able to put it down!","Very exciting book about the hardships of an immigrant's life. The best book he has ever written. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. It may be long, but in the end it is worth all the time. I hope he writes a second book about Paul Crown and his life. If he does I asure you I will be the first in line to buy it.Nicole Snyder1"
4,Great Companion to Larson's book,"Fortunately, I picked up Larson's ""Summer for the Gods"" and this book at the same time. Since there are so many characters in the trial, it was very useful to have a companion book to look at while going through Larson's sometimes dense prose. One does not have to look far in this book to see that the trial was one of the first examples of the prototypical ""media circus"" Overall, a very highly recommended companion piece for anybody interested in the trial."
2,Rhythm Guitar,"Material looks good,but no no cd. A cd would have gotten 5 stars. Blues Rhythms You Can Use by John Ganapes is a better book. It has a cd."
5,"Fast shipping, CD arrived in perfect condition. Thank you! This is a highly recommended seller!","Fast shipping, CD arrived in perfect condition. Thank you! This is a highly recommended seller!"
2,Really not helpful at all,"This DVD is next to worthless for me. no explanation of anything, particularly in the crucial rhythm section. Just some show-offy guitar playing by the guy in the video, with zero explanation or context or insight in any of the material.Awful."
3,Powerful book but doesn't stand on its own,"This is a pretty comprehensive book. But don't expect to learn all you can from it alone. It really does need a CD or maybe even a DVD with lectures. Reading this M.I?That said it is a very comprehensive book. If you're trying to learn this at home alone you'll have your work cut out for you. That is a kind way of saying you'll become frustrated. I needed to use software, metronome and instructor to be able to understand what was written down. Maybe it was just me but if this came easily then I probably wouldn't have needed to buy the book. If you have access to the above (guitar software, instructor) then you can add a star or two. If you don't now any music theory at all then subtract 2 stars.Having access to a good instructor and using this as a syllabus is the best route."
2,Good as a toy terrible as a teether,I expected it to be much softer. It's fun for holding but way too hard for my 4-month teething baby. She bit into it few times and it made her cry. She no longer plays with it until she is older.
3,Montessori for the home,Great ideas on making your home a prepared environment for your child to flourish in!
2,Book review,I was not impressed by the content of the book. Many of the activities seem very intuitive.I will however keep the book to help supplement what I currently do with kids.
1,not all that creative,This book was not what I was expecting. It had a very brief review of Montessori theory and then a bunch of basic activities you can do with your child. None of the activities were all that creative or anything that I couldn't have thought of myself.
3,Good resource; not exactly what I was looking for.,"This book is a great introduction to the Montessori Method and how to incorporate Montessori teachings into your home and daily life. I coordinate after-school programming and was in search of new resource books. While I am enjoying reading about the Montessori techniques, it is not quite appropriate for my line of work."
3,Hippeastrums,"Books on Hippeastrums are very few and far between. Veronica Read has attempted a comprehensive description of her knowledge and understanding of the genus as it applies to cultivation in the United Kingdom. The illustrations are good but unfortunately do not cover many of the more important cultivars, mentioned in her narrative. Genetic information is unfortunately almost non existant, which is not altogether surprising as very little genetic information has been published anywhere concerning Hippeastrums. Generally speaking Veronica Read has gathered together much of the more general information which has been published around the world and has presented it in a manner which is very suitable for the average gardener. Those of us who may have been looking for a more technical tretise on Hippeastrums must unfortunately look elsewere."
2,Dissapointing.,I love national geographic and have watched them most of my life. I was not impressed with this one. It did have some good footage but it wasn't what I had expected. I have seen other programs where animals blended into their environment. Some plants even have this ability. This fact wasn't even touched on. Lithops are a prime example.I kept looking for some animals that were hard to spot. I saw some insects. Just because a frog is bright green doesn't mean it is using camouflage.I usually love National Geographic but not in this case. Don't buy this one.
3,More lightweight than I expected,"I have used Interpretation copmmentaries before and this is rather less scholarly than I am accustomed to. The author treats the book of Esther in a rather flippant manner. Even if she considers the story to be overly dramatic and exaggerated, she could have treated the subject with more respect."
3,The Mirror VHS version,"The quality of the VHS tape itself was not very good. I had to put the contrast and brightness on the highest setting to be able to see it OK. The first time through is quite confusing. As one person in the reviews pointed out, it is a reflection of a man's life but not chronologically. It does refect the life in the USSR from 1930's into 1970's as bittersweet-a few joys and much suffering. Recommend a second viewing before making a judgement on the film. Much is cleared up in the second viewing."
2,Awful picture quality ruined one of my favourite films,"I'm never impressed with DVD's ability to handle black and white, but this is barely watchable. Even the colour scenes are terribly pixellated. I don't know why Kino released this - I would have happily paid more for better quality. It's a great shame - they seem to have the rights to several good Russian films, but on the basis of this, aren't able t handle the responsibility. Get VHS. Great film etc etc, but I do feel I have wasted my money...."
3,"Good, but can't touch Tarkovsky's best","'The Mirror' is yet another slow-moving and dreamlike film from one of the great filmmakers of the 20th century, Andrei Tarkovsky. It is hypnotizing to watch, but it doesn't match up with Tarkovsky's other mindblowing works. These include 'The Sacrifice', 'Stalker', and 'Solaris'. Still, film buffs should watch it because there are scenes of unforgettable mysticism."
5,The work of a genius,"I would give this film 15 stars of 10. I've seen it many times on DVD, both Russian version (Zerkalo) and English version (The Mirror). The Russian version (in fact the original) is far superior. Tarkovsky is my favorite director, he was a genius, and I saw all his seven films. They are all haunting, a quest for the spiritual dimension of life. The Mirror is his chef d'oeuvre, in my humble opinion. In my personal ranking of all the films I've seen so far, it is nr. 1."
1,"IF YOU LIKE THIS POEM, THIS MOVIE'S FOR YOU, OR YOU HAVE A BRAIN TUMOR","'A man has one body/so solitary/The soul is sick/of this solid sheath.../with eyes and ears the size of buttons.../and skin, a mass of scars,/a skeleton's robe' ... And on and on for 30 lines of VO commentary over cryptic visuals of obtuse behavior which relate not in any way I can see with the other dour, jumbled, drumming elements of this pastiche of words and pictures that have no meaning or connection.This is not an entertaining film. Nor edifying or interesting. Other reviews have said, like it's a good thing, that audiences were churned and divided. Must be true. And frustrated and confused and wishing the jumble of meaningless scenes faded quickly.I have other AT films, like Solaris and Stalker. Each much better than this whatever it is. The case cover says 'Extraordinarily Beautiful'; not so. Also it says 'Haunting masterpiece'; half-right, haunting it is, but not in a good way. Save your rubles for vodka."
2,The slowest movie ever made?,"First of all. I love Tarkovskij's movies (most of them) but this one is really something different. The film has not been panned and scanned it was shot in full frame ratio which is strange and it is only like 100 minutes long but it feels more like 200 minutes. I am a filmtheory student and have a hard time understanding the greatness of this film. To me it's just a lot of random scenes and sequences that are impossible to follow. However, as a big cinema fasn you should have seen this anyway. =) One funny thing is the menus that are kind of weird in a russian way. Which I also like."
1,I wish I was on what you folks were on while watching this junk,"This was, by far, the worst movie I have EVER seen. I just can't see how anyone could rate such drivel 5 stars. Barney's entry in the Springfield film festival was more ""artistic"" than this!Maybe you need to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth or live in the subculture of the artistic wanna be types to appreciate this film. Prior to this, I thought Doom the Movie was the worst movie ever made...until now. When I envision the punishment of Hell after death, I now imagine being shown this movie over and over for all eternity.Yikes this was horrible. I never even knew DVD players could cry, but mine shed a tear tonight..."
4,Phoenix Fan,"This is a great 2 pack if you like Night and Phoenix. It's got all the extras on the DVD too. It's a good value for the money, and compact, I have one case instead of two. I just wish they were both widescreen."
5,Still a great book,When this book first came out in 1974 it was one of the best books of its type and its photos were pure eye candy. Though as time has gone by more complete publications have come along but this book is still quite beautiful informative and worth owning.Recommended
1,DO NOT BUY,"This book was extremely boring and made absolutely no sense. the characters were disjointed and unappealing. I gave it 1 star because I had to, it doesn't deserve any. If you can find it in your local library read it there, because this one is a definite DO NOT BUY"
1,A Waste of Time,"This book was so boring. Is Barbara Gale and Eva Rutland the same person? If so, then I can understand why this book is soooooo boooooring! I threw it in the trash-where it definitely belongs!"
3,bbeauty59,"Good story, good characters and believable. The chemistry was good and the bi-racial issue was evident but not the main theme of the story. The fact that Harry was white and Althea black did not over shadow the story, which from my point of view, is that relationships between men and women are hard to get right and it takes commitment and determination to make it work. Light reading,I read this book in one night and it satisfied my romantic soul."

5,Very Handy Device,"This device met my expectations and more. We live on a high place with frequent thunderstorms, we've lost several tv sets in the past due to lightening strikes on our antennas and satellite dishes. This device is just what the doctor ordered in protecting all our electrical equipment from strong surges."
2,This product is poorly described.,"My complaint isn't with the product, it's with Amazon's description of the product.Hornady makes TWO styles of shell plate in over 30 sizes.The two styles are original and EZject. They are not cross compatable. You must look at your press manual to determine which style of shell plate you need. If you got your press after about 2010 (just going from memory), it will require the EZject shell plate.The size is based upon the caliber you wish to reload. The Hornady AP press owner's manual lists which shell plate fits which calibers.I just opened my Christmas present to find a Hornady Lock N Load AP press and was hoping to be able to equip it via an Amazon gift card but I guess I'll after to go to Midway to get this thing running."
1,Recording to Cassette Tape,"After scouring the internet for reviews on this DVD I found one. It said this video is out of date and has no info on recording to mp3 or wav formats but shows how to record to cassette tape. Recording techniques may not change that much so some of the info may still be useful, but I'm steering clear."
2,DId not work for me in NY state,I was holding this in my hand while painting and I still got eaten alive. I will not be buying any refill packets.
2,Marginal,"I had not tried the particular substance this machine uses, and, like most people, am desperate to find something that works. It does, but no better than my old torches. The search for something effective does not end with this machine."
4,Just got it but already love it,"We live on 60 acres with lots of woods and a pond at our front door,although we love it here the Mosquitos and other flying insects can be bothersome. Last year we put in a swimming pool and obviously spend slot of time outside so to stay comfortable we purchased 2 of the propane operated mosquito magnets which worked great after several weeks. Long story short this season neither of them work and while waiting on my husband to repair them(already close to a month) I have been terrorized outdoors ,then I saw these inexpensive babies(bought 2). The day after receiving them I was outside getting attacked so I opened the box and I had bought and charged batteries ahead of time and as soon as I switched it own they ""critters"" started to leave, that was 15 minutes ago I mean it was instant.....I hope it continues, also I have read other reviews about how to get more use out of the refills so I will let you know how this works."
2,Not Classroom Friendly,"This book is not the level of difficulty I was expecting. The questions seemed obvious, not probing, as they were advertised. Using the standard method of evaluating grade level (syllables per sentence)many were not 10-12th grade level equivalent. It was my desire to use this book with high functioning as well as low functioning readers. I read several stories, and did not feel the questions really assessed higher level comprehension.Having said that, I might have still used the book as a supplement for my weaker readers; however, there were no, even ballpark, answers included in the manual. I do not have time to read and reread 45 stories to check a student's work. With a little more research and work ,the concept of this text would have been achieved;as it it, it wasn't."
2,Where are the answers?,"I really enjoyed having so many short, ready-to-use texts to use with my students, which saves me time searching the Internet. However, there are no answers nor is there a teacher's edition. All the questions are open-ended, which is good for students but bad for teachers who have piles and piles of papers to grade."
5,"Canto General, A Wonderful Melding of Greek, Hispanic and 20th Century Music","I purchased two recordings of this. One was conducted by Theodorakis in 1980, the second was recorded by Frangiskos Voutsinos in 1989. Both were recorded in Berlin with the Rundfunkchor Berlin. I found the 1989 recording to be really better! It has superior sound and the performance is much more rhythmic with the performers being more involved and commited to an outstanding production. The 1989 recording has crystal clear sound with superior reproduction of the tenor soloist and superior choir. Both are good and the Voutsinos recording is outstanding!"
5,Splendid! ¡Fantastico!,"I heard this on Boston's National Public Radio and knew immiediately that it was the work of genius. Neruda's poetry set to song! It's in Spanish, but even if one doesn't speak the language, the music is a language all it's own."
4,Great sound,"I remember when I would have stayed up all night, if necessary, to install a new piece of audio equipment. Well, it's hooked up for TV and cd/dvd but not yet for radio and tape decks. I had some friends over the day after I installed it and we watched several hours of concerts on dvd. Their response was unanimous: FABULOUS! And that's without a subwoofer. Front pair of speakers are Klipsch F-3 towers. Center and rear are cheap set of Sony's.Sometimes the receiver has a mind of its own. I restarted a movie we had just watched and it played with commentary. It would not let me change it back to no commentary. This has never happened prior. I think it may be a compatability issue.TV picture looks better but I have to adjust the aspect ratio and the ""video status""(color variants) every time I watch something. It doesn't really bother me but for someone who does not want to fiddle with the controls to get the optimal picture, it will be a hassle."
4,Very Happy,"Just hooked this up over the weekend. A little tricky to set it up but the sound and features from this unit are great. I doubt there is a better receiver out there for $400. If you don't like to read the users manual, buy a simple receiver with less features."
3,WHY ONLY 10 SONGS???,"This, along w/ Columbia's BEST OF THE BIG BANDS-KAY KYSER was one of the first Kyser compilations to be distributed widely, but with only 10 songs, each usually under 3 minutes, it seems almost wasted. I wonder why they included so few? Perhaps it sold at a discount price (still does here)because they didn't believe in it very much. What IS here represents some high points, and the pic they used is the same pic on the new BEST OF GINNY SIMMS W/ KYSER CD. Frankly, I'd go with one of the others, the best (and more bang for the buck) being A STRICT EDUCATION IN MUSIC. 50 songs for the price of a single CD. Worth every penny..."
5,Excellent production of a rare Williams play,"Outstanding performance by a luminous Blythe Danner and a wonderfully underplayed Frank Langella. We enjoyed this much more than ""Summer and Smoke""."
3,"delicate flower, thorny plot","A prim and proper delicate flower maid, obsessed with affection for the young handsome Doctor, tries to land him in the matrimony net, but alas the harder she tries the more she fails.Well how about a one night stand ? Well he thinks,"" not a good idea "". Well many moon-years later in the same park, on the same nght (the 4th of July) the young maid (not too young any more) makes contact with a younger hombre and away they go. ""If at first you don't succeed, try try, again ? For a Broadway Archive production, not an orchestra seat performance, but O.K for the balcony ?"
2,good,"good the first part related to the origin of the tarots, a little weak the part related to the meaning of the trumps. good for a general overview about tarots"
3,I'm really not sure about this book,"I would like to say that I loved this book but there were many little things that bothered me.***Spoilers***I really didn't like the fact that the h was taller than the H. The way he was described at times sounded like he was slight and much smaller than her. At times she sounded like an Amazon but at others she sounded slender. It was confusing.I hated how resistant the h was to the H, I found it overdone in parts. She was a bit of a pain at time really.I did like the hero and he definitely had depth and intelligence and I loved the way he would quote things she said back to her but in another way.There were funny parts in the book and I did laugh at times."
4,"Good product, works well","I was looking for some device that would help me control my speakers volume at certain area of the house without having to walk to where the amplifier is. The Phoenix Gold VMT-100 works fine, the installation was easy (I did it myself)and it's small size doesn't bother at all.It was not exactly was I was expecting since the maximum volume it delivers is less than the one the speakers had before; it just let me turn the volume a little down, but I lost some output. I'm trying some other type of connections to see if it helps and I'm sure it will do it."
2,Poor sound quality...,"I bought the VMT-100 to control the volume of a pair of Bose, in-wall speakers I purchased at the same time. Once installed, I was very disappointed with the flat/dull sound from the Bose and was almost ready to return them. After double checking all the connections (used Monster, 14ga in-wall cable) decided to try a different volume control (a more expensive one from Niles) before giving up on the speakers.At least in this case, cost equals performance/quality... with the Niles volume control the speakers ""woke"" right up and now seem to produce both the crisp highs and lows the VMT-100 wouldn't pass through."
1,Garbage - do not buy,"These units are deeper than a standard electrical box. The wire connectors are only deep enough for 1/4"" of wire, thereby guaranteeing that the wires will pop out over and over again when you try to fit the unit into an electrical box (and good luck doing that - these things leave NO room in the box for your speaker wires). The instructions are unintelligible - tables where you need to look up a jumper setting based on the number of speakers actually refer to PAIRS of speakers, but you can only work this out by reading and re-reading the garbled examples. To mount the unit in a decora box, you have to attach a plate that does not fit at all securely. A colossal hassle overall - AVOID."
4,Good volume control,"This volume control works very well. Its range is from 0 being off to 10 being full volume. It has very nice detents so you know what level of volume you are at without listening. I find this helpful as the control is outside and master volume is inside. I set the outside control to about 5 and then turn the amplifier a little louder than normal. When I go back outside the volume can stay where it is or be turned up for a really good song and then back down without having to go in and out of the house.The control seems to be solidly constructed and fairly easy to install. I put it outside, but in a protected area. So far no problems."
3,Hope my kids will play with it at some point,"We tried it out and while it is educational.... well, there's just other games that are more fun. I hope my son will play with it when he's older ( 9 now), but I took it to the hospital when I had a baby and in spite of my boredom, didn't play it much (variations of solitaire were more fun)."
3,Very fun but pieces are hard to manipulate,"We really enjoy the concept of this game. My 6 year old likes it and so do I! However, we both find it very tricky to keep the logs in place. The little mans feet get in the way of picking up the logs. Better designed pieces would make this game much more enjoyable to play."
4,Good thinking toy,"Bought this for our 12 year old niece and she loved it (even the boy cousins, ages 13 and 15 got in on it). It's easy to pick up and learn and a great game for the mind."
4,R,Good Product to purchase for your kids. Can be used to kindle the brains and helps in skills and abilities.
1,I am sorry I bought this game,"My grandson is 11 and he just isn't interested in this game. I bought both of the River Crossing games, for Christmas, and he hasn't even looked at the second one."
4,Good game for killing time,"This game is fun and well designed and I felt was worth the money I paid. It's a good game for killing some time as some of the puzzles take quite a while. The portability is nice as it comes with it's own bag so you can take it anywhere you may be sitting for a while. I felt the only drawback to this game were the levels of difficulty. The cards are divided up into 4 levels of difficulty with each level having 10 puzzles. Unfortunately, I found that levels 1,2, and much of 3 are not very challenging for anyone who is fairly good at logic puzzles. So you're left with about 12-14 really good puzzles. Coming in at (...) though, I feel it's not a waste of money."
5,Postcards from the Edge,"You're on the trip of a lifetime and you promised to send postcards to your friends and relatives. Why not send scenic cards with you in them? Ask a traveling companion to snap a few photos of you. Hook up your digital camera to a portable canon printer and run off a few perfect postcards using the KP-36IP pack. Write ""Wish you were here"" on the left side and paste on a few stamps. Voila, personalized postcards from anywhere in the world.Better yet, take a photo of someone you are traveling with and give them a postcard to send home. Talk about a great conversation starter!"
3,Paper is NOT blank on back side,"The description for this paper states ""...blank on the back side, just like photos from your local print shop"". THIS IS NOT TRUE. The back side is just like a post card with space for an address, etc. Canon apparantly does not make 4""x6"" paper for the Selphy dye-sub printers with a blank back side. IMO, the postcard look is kind of tacky when giving prints to other people. Amazon needs to update their description to reflect this, and to include the other printers that can use this paper.The quality of prints produced by the Selphy printers on this paper is very good and comparable with competitive products from Epson and HP."
3,nice quality photos but....,"nice qualtiy photos, but has the perforated paper at top and bottom in order to pull it thru the photo printer."
3,crushed order,"These items(of which I ordered 6), came in 6 individual padded envelopes, but each box was crushed and 2 even torn open. Had these ordered a few months ago, and the total number was shipped in one large sturdy box. Very disappointed with the condition. This is 6 boxes of photo paper with indivdual ink cartridges. Hoping the latter are in working order...............delivered UPS."
2,Canon Paper,"On the package it says 3 X 5 postcard size paper. We thought it was describing the size of the paper which we wanted for prints. However, it was 3 X 5 postcard stock which was a little deceiving. WE will use it but it is not what we wanted."
2,Higher cost per sheet,"Product quanity make this a bad buy for this printer, cost per print. The Cannon KP-36IP is a poor purchase that I made with my printer, which has 36 paper/cartridge set. I followed Amazons recomendations and will not do that again.KP-108IN is by far a better buy and would recomend this instead, because you get 3 times the product (108 sheets & 2 catridges) for less than twice the cost of KP-36IP."
5,This is the paper you need for a Selphy.,"Even comes printed on the back for a postcard. The paper is a little longer than required, but the top and bottom come off cleanly with fine perforations."
3,A necessary requirement,"If you have a Selphy printer, you don't really have a choice but to get this package. Those ink cartridges really run out quickly, so I would recommend the three pack."
3,Works great with a little 'lube,"Didn't spin very well until I opened it up and put a little vaseline where the axel turns. It went back together nicely. They should mention on the box how to lube it with a little vaseline. Now it spins wonderfully and my one year old loves it. He does tug really hard on the fish though, and I wonder if he will eventually pull them off of the wheel."
2,Built solid but not friendly,"This thing is huge, it barely fits in a 2x4 wall without hitting the drywall on the other side. The speaker wire is secured by a small screw. It fits about a quater inch of wire inside the housing. I have problems with the screw connections and speaker wire falling out. It could be designed much better. There are two speaker inputs and two out puts, I had to splice wires to make my surround sound speakers work."
2,Only 4 months to eat this...,"I bought this tub of candy in early November 2012 for my girlfriend because it is her favorite candy.What I noticed after I only opened it to begin wrapping it, that there was a sticker on the top of the lid that said that it will expire in 2/28/2013.This is a lot of candy to be wasted by the expiration date.The candy taste great, but half won't be eatten."
5,JOURNEY OF A SOUL,"Spiritual Warriors movie is the story of humankind moving through the worlds of illusion; learning, experiencing and confronting all his terrors and getting the keys to overcome them and never alone, always guided and supported with loving care by a Mystical Traveler on his journey to the awakening of his true self and at the end the only sword he needs is his loving hearth.Ozzie & Maravilla"
5,SPIRITUAL WARRIORS,"My mind (and heart) was open and ready for anything. I truly had no idea what to expect. Instantly I was absorbed in ""Finn's"" journey...at times even feeling as though I was sharing his walk. By the end of the film I found answers to questions of my own. SPIRITUAL WARRIORS can (and will)help to renew and motivate YOUR spirit... whether you needed it or not! What a sensational beginning to a New Year filled with challenges and uncertainty. HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
4,Spiritual Warriors,"I found the film 'Spiritual Warriors' very inspiring; it brings home the fact that we have the opportunity to understand the meaning of our lives, our relationships, etc., if only we would open ourselves up to see the signs and messages that are continually put before us. Once we take the first few steps we will then be on the path to spiritual enlightenment."
5,An Awakening,"When I watch the Spiritual Warriors movie, while I am seeing with my eyes and listening with my ears, I am experiencing the movie inside of myself on many different levels and in many extraordinary ways. This film continues to be an awakening. I am moved to a deeper inner understanding of ""who"" I truly am and how important it is to pay attention to all of the opportunities and possibilities that are presented to me in my life. I am moved to an insistence to look to expanding outside of my ""comfort zone"" when I check out what is calling me forward and the information is clear. I love this film. I encourage all to see it. I've watched it many times."
4,An inner journey reflection,This is another reminder of the importance of going within to search for your own answers to the universal key questions. Who am I?; what am I here for?; what is the purpose of life?. The film in itself has achieved to trigger this self reflection in me each time I had seen it. And every time I watched it I focused on something different. So I am not going to comment on the film quality since I am not a film making expert nor I understand what makes a good performance to be rated good. So I will only say that this film allows me to connect with my heart and continue searching for my own answers.
5,Spiritual Quest,"A modern story of an old soul's spiritual quest to find the truth within himself once more. Subtly and sensitively acted by Jsu Garcia, Robert Easton and cast. It explores the dilemma we face when there is a convergance of the modern, spiritual, and metaphysical realities of this world. As a movie, it is entertaining and engaging. It begins a process onscreen that continues to unfold within each viewer long after the movie has ended. This movie is a gift to the soul."
3,Shoulda Coulda Been a Great Movie,"The concept is great, and I was looking forward to seeing the film. Fortunately for me, I only paid for a video-on-demand rental. The execution of the movie--the dialog, the directing, the acting--was, unfortunately, not up to the film's potential. Sort of like daytime soap opera, made tragic by the fact that it had wonderful locations and was trying to convey a great message. Too bad."
5,An amazing integration,"Spiritual Warriors is a movie I can watch over and over again while finding something new, enlightening, and uplifting every time. I'm not inclined to watch a lot of movies, so the fact that this one has such amazing presence and a clear message of loving, upliftment, and growth-promoting lessons speaks very highly of the filmmakers."
5,GREAT,"I saw this movie in the theatre and just loved it. Jsu is hot for one and also this moive made me cry. It is a wonderful story, touching, loving, exciting...see it. You won't regret it."
5,"Knock out the crap, straight advice!","This book was excellent with helping me realize common traps in a consumer driven world. Advice presented was straight forward and easy to understand. The examples used are relateable and can be applied to anyone's situation. Finally, a debt book for anyone that cuts straight to the point!"
1,Book is an ad for Springboard,"Springboard is a typical credit counseling company that passes itself off as a consumer friendly organization. Meanwhile, they are funded by the creditors. This book is basically a 200 page ad for Springboard's services and should not be bought. Save your hard earned money and do free research on the web. Credit counseling is looked at like a bankruptcy by most lenders and nearly every mortgage company. It's certainly something you don't want on your credit report."
1,A farse!,It is almost as if the bureaus presented this information! Not a help at all. Save time and money and do an internet search. It will be infinitely more helpful!
4,Addy Saves the Day,"The book was the older version, which was fine, but the first photo was of the newer print. I believe the photos were of all printed versions; however, it was somewhat confusing to know which one you were getting. I was fine with the white cover because we had the similar books already and it made a complete set, but it would have been nice to know up front that we were completing what we already had. Otherwise, very happy with our purchase."
5,This is the best dream book I have come across!,"I have looked through many different dream books and I have never found the right one for me, until now. This book has helped me to interpret my dreams as well as other people in my life. It really is fantastic!"
2,Too much like a psychology textbook,Don't bother with this book for dream interpretations...it's too much like a textbook - dry and technical.
1,Condescension,"I agree with the other one-stars that the characters lack any sort of depth and the story itself is very difficult to follow... but I'd also like to add on that the book, to me, reads very condescendingly. While reading it, I felt like the writer thinks he's smarter than the reader and that the reader should consider themselves lucky to be allowed enough to read his words. This is one of those times where the movie really is better than the book."
3,Well-written and deep characterizations,"Overall, there are many things to enjoy about this novel. From the sharp writing, to the engaging plot, and a slew of interesting characters. The protagonist, however, was just not redeemable to me. He seemed to have an insatiable bloodlust that I found to be off-putting. This should not be read as an indictment on the novel itself. I simply had a difficult time connecting with the main character. Most readers will feel differently since this has become a huge hit."
2,Flat writing,"There are writing features of this book that I enjoyed, but overall it is a shallow, weak story with unengaging characters."
4,Dripping with Darkness,"I read Drive after seeing the film by the same name. The book differs in many areas of the film, which makes it hard to compare. As a book, James Sallis creates an intriguing character we get to know through flashbacks and quick chapters. I like the snippets of character, the brush strokes of a man only known as ""Driver."" Mr. Sallis writes with dead-on brevity and gives us only enough information to open the door a crack. I love how he writes, it's just as mysterious as the character. There are times, however, where I find it confusing to tell who is speaking. Eliminating all ""Driver saids"" in a sequence of ten lines makes it necessary to count evens and odds to differentiate each character. But I get what Sallis is going for with his prose, and he is a master at it. Overall, a great character study leading to a great film! -Jonathan Sturak 02/22/2012"
2,Familiar Story,"While being a respectable 1940's style noir presentation, Mr. Sallis' words overpower his character's actions. Perhaps that's the curse of the short novel, which this is. The downside created the lack of an avenue to connect with the Driver as much as I should have.Something else also bothered me about this book. I felt like I had read this story before. I was right. There's a book called The Company She Keeps by Georgia Durante. It's a true life story published in 1998 of a woman who drove getaway cars for the Mob who later became a stunt driver. The Company She Keeps is also 456 pages of true life experiences including domestic abuse and celebrity fame.If you like reading about action, adventure and inspiration then The Company She Keeps by Georgia Durante is the book for you."
1,Sucked,This book was terrible!!! The writting didn't make sense at parts (I had to re-read 3 charpters more than once to make any sort of sense out of it) and the characters are VERY under devolopped and the story wasn't very well thought out.I recomend you skip the book and just watch the movie of the same name it is soooo much better (thanks to the very talented Nicholas WinDing Refn)
1,Disappointment,"I bought it, read it, and threw it in the recycle bin. Hopefully it will be reborn as photocopy paper or something similar which will be of more value than the author's work on this novel."
4,Great complement to the film,"I never heard of this book until I saw the film. I could be taking away from the book by discussing the film but the film brought me to the book. I believe they are great complements. It is interesting seeing how two different forms of media can make something their own. The book does a great job of providing a history of the driver, giving back story the film lacked. As short as this book was, it provided rich characters. After finishing the book I just wanted more to read. I plan to get more of James Sallis' work on my reading list. I'm looking forward to the sequel of this book which comes out in April."
2,disjointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. Maybe because I saw the movie first I had an idea of the structure, but I was quite wrong. I've never read a book that skipped back and forth without any semblance of time. It was almost impossible to determine when things were happening. I was baffled from one chapter to the next. I made the mistake of not looking in my local library first. I made sure I did that with James Sallis's other novel ""Driven."""
2,"With short writing and little character development, Drive is one of the few novels bested by its film version","I read Drive after seeing the wonderful film a few weeks back and was incredibly disappointed in the novel. The Driver is given very little development, the writing is actually too succinct to really build any imagery and the stakes don't feel as high as the ones in the film thanks to the lack of any visible chemistry between the characters. While it isn't a total failure, Drive is one of the few novels-if you can even call it that considering that you can finish it in a few hours-that is actually bested by its film version."
2,Is this a first draft?,I appreciate the idea behind this story but the execution failed severely. It needs editing. It is so flawed that I think the author may have not even proofread. I suggest that you skip this book and watch the film which is magnificent.
4,Lean & mean,Predicts its own screenplay. You must pay attention. No wasted words or energy. You're hooked. Masterful.
2,Waiting room fodder,"You can get an idea about the story from other people's reveiws. I can just tell you that this was a disapointing recoomendation from Amazon. You can read this in one sitting as it is very short. The story is basic and very unoriginal. I would bet money that this was the authors classroom assignment. The story flashes back and forward in time to give it a Momento-esque story line, but keeps it realy simple so the average slurpee pusher at 7-11 can follow the story between customers. This book would have been a good product for a community college creative writing class, but as for spending money on it, I wouldn't do it unless you are trying to make the transition from fantasy novels to detective pulp."
4,"Drive, The Book, The Man, The Occupation","The name of the book is the name of the major character and it is his occupation.This is a short book (take it with you if your flight is not a real long one, I finished this book in a few hours), but it is excellent (gritty, grimy) crime fiction. If you are looking for noir in a modern book, look no further."
2,Okay But No Better,"This was first exposure to this author. The writing was competent so I'll try another one but this story left me kind of flat. It features a protagonist known only as ""Driver"" who grew up poor and abandoned but liked fast cars and drove them well. He becomes a movie stuntman and moonlights driving getaway cars for a series of low-life thieves. Unfortunately, when a book is populated almost exclusively by uneducated, uninteresting deadbeats with no redeeming virtues it's hard to care what happens to them or the book. The late Charles Willeford did deadbeats well; Mr. Sallis doesn't."
2,Pretty bad.,"Regardless of how excited I am to still see the new movie version, the novel is really bad. It has no story, and is a hugely inferior copy of Andrew Vachss' amazing prose style, and Bret Easton Ellis' structure of American Pyscho.I am hugely disappointed with every aspect of this novel, save the length. If a novel is going to bore and infuriate you, best that, like this one, it only takes you 90 minutes to read."
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY ......,"WHAT A SHAMBLES !!!!! THIS PLAYOFF D.V.D MUST HAVE THEPOOREST PICTURE QUALITY OF ANY PENTHOUSE PRODUCTION.THE SCENES ARE BLAND, AND HALF OF THE DISC IS TAKEN FROMOTHER PENTHOUSE PROGRAMMES. WHAT A SHAME. THIS COULDHAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER, IF A LITTLE BIT OF THOUGHTAND EFFORT HAD BEEN USED. I HOPE THE "" PET OF THE YEAR ""D.V.D WILL BE BETTER. DON'T BUY THIS, IF YOU WANT EROTICART, BUY "" PETS IN PARADISE "" OR "" PET OF THE YEAR 2000 ""OR "" PET OF THE YEAR 2001 PLAYOFF """
1,1.5 out of 5 due to poor quality video and scenes,"Well I have to agree with the other Amazon.com reviewers,this is almost as bad as it gets. First off I noticed the video was as bad as POTY 97/98 DVD. Secondly the scenes were only a couple minutes long and the beautiful Megan Mason(which is POTY 2002) is only found in one or two scenes. Also to note this DVD suffers from really bad lighting such as back lighting and dark light which resulted in a too dark picture or a washed out look. I think Nick Guiccione needs to invest in some glasses or contacts because I would have recalled this product after I saw it when I was finished. AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS,ONLY ONE SCENE WORTH NOTING,THE FIRST SCENE WITH MEGAN BY THE POOL"
2,Nothing Special,There's really nothing special or fabulous about this video compared to the other Penthouse videos. Nothing new or imaginative at all.
2,disappointing,"My 8 month old daughter got this for x-mas. She loves to stand inside it, however for a relatively new stander the door is poorly designed. It slides shut and the roller on the door make it very hard for her. She can not pull herself up without the door opening or her slipping on the spindle on the door. That in itself is discouraging!!!!!!!!"
5,Great toy,"With so many great toys on the martket and limited space for it - this is a must to have, since you can compactly fold it away when not played with. Children in my daycare love to play with it- going in through the door, leaving from behind - they like to peak at each other through the mesh - would highly recommened."
5,PLAYSKOOL TOYS,AWESOME; DAUGHTER RECOMMENDED PURCHASE AND TODDLER AND NEW BABY LOVE TO PLAY WITH IT! VERY ENTERTAINING; DO NOT GET BORED EASILY NOR FEEL CLOSED IN!
3,this is an average toy---nothing spectacular,"6 mo. is too young for this toy. It's best if they can at least crawl. I keep this toy put away and get it out occasionally.We have the fisher-price learning home and my daughter seems to enjoy that toy a lot more than this one. She likes this one, but it doesn't occupy her as long."
4,Still loves it after 2 years!,"I got this for my daughter for her first birthday and she loved it right away. She is 2 1/2 now and still plays with it everyday. She dumps anything that will fit into the little tube and then goes inside to retrieve it. Although she's pretty big now, she still loves going in and out of her little ""house"". Definitely a good buy!"
4,Great fun from 3 to 12 months or more,My twin babies are 11 months old now and they simply love this dome. The best part has been seeing them evolving: at first they simply stayed looking at the toys hanging from the dome. After some months they play with every single feature the dome has to offer.It has a very firm structure. You can see that right when you follow the instructions to get it mounted.Up until recently my twins would play together inside the dome. Now only one at a time to avoid fights for space. :-)I believe they will continue to enjoy this toy for a long time.
4,Peek & Play Dome,"I bought this as a christmas gift for my 18 month old daughter and she loves it! I was concerned that it would be too small for her. Thankfully, there is planty of room inside for her to sit and stand.Excellent toys to keep her attention & easy to assemble!!"
3,Hard,"Wow, this is hard. I thought I was in decent shape, but the beginners video nearly did me in. There probably should be better notices that this is for fit people. Though I've only done it a couple of times so far.Also, he uses my worst pet peeve in exercise videos - he says one more time when he really means three more times. I hate that."
4,GREAT FOR EVERYONE,"I bought this set after trying out the orignal Bootcamp Basic Training that I got from a friend. The workouts are okay. I will be honest though - some workouts I find to be very uncomfortable and even impossible because of the positioning of the bands. If not done properly you can really hurt yourself.I reccommend you use hand weights for certain exercises...either 21b or 3lb or whatever weight that challenges you. And according to the exercises you're doing u may need ankle weights also. But please choose weights that you are comfortable with. Besides that, it's a good workout. It does target different parts of the body and it does make you sweat like crazy. Will reccommend you buy it.If you can work the bands well fine, but if not use free weights. I use both. It's up to you to know which workouts you want to use the free weights with."
1,Billy Blanks,I bought this set hoping to be able to workout at home...all but one of these dvds had a scratch or imperfection on them and skipped the first time I played them. My friend bought the same set and the same thing happened to her.
2,My my my,"Well, I'm not a bootcamp fan. For those looking for a good CARDIO workout, this certainly is not. It's not well managed, the bands can be extremely painful (think ripping out hair by the roots!), and the heart rate will not go up. The arm work burns the shoulders, but the pressure is too light to do any of the other muscles any serious good.If I had it to do over again I would not buy this set, and I will NEVER do the ab video again. I stopped midway b/c the bands were so painful."
2,billy blanks boot camp elite,"It took a couple weeks for the product to be shipped, but the product was intact. The bands work fine and that is what I ordered it for, but I cannot get the DVD's to work on either my pc, mac, ps3, xbox or dvd player. A contact would be nice to see if I can get an exchange, because even though I have videos already, I would have liked to try the new ones that came in the Elite pack."
1,Over the top,"What is Billy doing? I'm a huge fan of Tae Bo cardio and wanted to branch out a bit and bought this box of garbage. The other reviewers hint at it: these Billy Bands are beyond uncomfortable and close to impossible to use at the correct tension. You're wrists will be sore after from the amount of timeS the handle area of the bands will slap against them. Also, the workouts themselves are lame. They're way too hard. Even his top instructors are caught cheating or skipping steps at times. Also, is Billy retarded? He constantly fumbles his words and says things that don't make sense, then spends too much time trying to correct himself, turning what was supposed to be 2 sets of 8 into 10 sets of 8.DON'T BUY IT. YOU'LL REGRET IT."
3,Good Bootcamp workout set.,"This workout set is good but not as great as the other workout set's from Billy Blanks.I only love the Mission Two DVD. During this workout you realy feel the burn. But you sweat not so much like during a Tae Bo cardio workout.Mission one and Mission three are to easy for me. And I can't feel the burn:'(You get three workout and the Billy Elite bands.Mission one: great for beginners. It's easy.Mission Two: realy great and hard.Mission three: the ab workout. The bands cut in my arms during this workout, and it hurts:-/. Not good Mr. Blanks.But the Billy Elite bands are great:-). I love this bands soooo much. You can use the bands also for the old Bootcamp workouts. The bands have removable weights in grips. You also get a workout rotation calender.So I only give three stars."
2,Very disappointed- even though I love TAE BO,"I am an avid lover of Tae Bo, and I have over 20 DVDs (along with about 5 VHS tapes). Since I have never been disappointed with Tae Bo whether reviews were positive or negative, I decided to add this to my ever growing fitness DVD collection. I completed all three missions in successive order, and I was BORED and my heart rate monitor only got within my training zone for a total of 5 minutes. I am not sure what happened with this series, but I would only recommend it to the beginner of the beginners!"
5,wonderful product,After going through half a winter of dryer vent drafts I remembered there was a product like this I had seen before. Read the reviews and ordered it. Installed it on a 20 degree day and noticed an almost immediate improvement in my laundry room temperature. Cold and windy as it is outside my laundry room is much warmer.Works as claimed.
5,Product is what it says,The company shipped the product quickly and the vent works great. It is suggested that you paint the vent if it is in a spot with direct sunlight. Other than that the installation was a snap.Should bring me lots of save money in the future as the cold air was always coming in my old vent. This one hasn't let any in yet. The floors are no longer cold and I don't have to keep towels on the floor in front of my washer and dryer.
5,Great vent !,"OK, I have not installed mine yet, but a colleague has put two on his house (dryer and over-stove extractor) and says they are really a big improvement over the other sorts of vent :)"
5,Heartland Dryer Vent,"The Heartland Dryer Vent is a very good product. It is Well built, will last many years and does exactly as advertised.I recommend this product."
5,Vent closure review,Item seems to work very well in stopping drafts returning back into house. Easy to install. I highly recommend it!
4,Very good product,"This is a good quality product. I had some minor difficulty installing because the holes on the flange did not match up with the mortar cracks in the brick foundation. Other holes can be drilled in the flange, just be prepared to drill holes in whatever wall this is to be mounted. I painted after installation with a brush and latex paint as recommended. I still wonder if a good quality spray paint applied before installation would have made more sense. Works great. We'll see how cold the dryer gets come winter!"
1,Missing pieces!,"Well, I am not off to a good start with this product. I bought it based on the glowing reviews. I received the shipment from Amazon today and found that the Heartland Dryer Vent closure was missing a couple of parts. The two main body units were nicely packaged, but there was no floating shuttle or cap in the box or packaging. I called the 800 number at Heartland to get some help, but only got an automated system and answering machine. I will try to reach them again tomorrow, but right now, I am not impressed with the company! The pieces that did arrive look sturdy, but they are useless without the floating shuttle and the cap!"
3,"Good design, but question it's longevity","This product has a great design in that it is easy to clean by removing the lid from the top if needed. If it was constructed of a little thicker, stronger material I would give it a four star rating. If it also included a through-the-wall length of pipe, I would give it a five star rating. I installed it a month ago. When the weather gets cold will it keep the heat in the house??? I will let you know. Most other dryer vent hoods do not give you a positive seal or the ease of cleaning builtup lint that the Heartland 21000 does."
5,very good product,"I had one of these and realy liked it but, didn't paint it about 7 years, then it began to crack, paited the new one"
4,"A good design, with some flaws","This is the second floating dryer vent cap that I have purchased. The first had a hinged cap with a catch and the plastic in the hinge broke, rendering the unit useless. The design of this product seems more sensible, with the cap just fitting down over the vent. Both the floating vent caps that I have tried do an excellent job of keeping animals and cold air out of your dryer outlet hoses, although their bulkiness makes them less than unobtrusive on the side of your house.Note added 3 months later: Unlike the previous floating cap vent I had, this unit does not trap any of the ""bleed-through lint"" that gets past the dryer filter and instead, blows it all over my deck where it has made a HUGE mess. I revise my evaulation to 3 stars."
2,Poor quality and poor customer service,"Purchased this and it was delivered quickly. However, the product had a yellowed top cap with stress cracks. It had flashing that was not removed after manufacturing it which was all over it. Obviously no quality checking and the tooling is old. The company refused to replace just the top cap and wanted me to return the whole item for a replacement. That would waste my time and money, when all they had to do to make me happy was to ship a new top cap. But they didn't. The product does work well however, but we'll see how it holds up in the winter. Plastic could be brittle."
2,HUGE,I liked the idea of this vent closure but it was much bigger than what I expected. Unless your vent closure is in a very discreet location you would probably not want to buy this.
4,stops all leaks,"This thing is great. it is -10 outside and you could feel it in my dryer with my standard flapper. I put this on and started the dryer. It blew the top off the first time (user error). It stopper the cold like it is designed to. It is easy to clean if needed. I have done about 30 loads so far no problems. the plastic does look brittle, and it does need painted to prevent breakdown from UV light."
2,didnt recieve all my parts,"I dont know if I like the blind or not as for I didnt recieve all the parts. It was shipped just in its store container and was not taped up on the ends or anything and when it finally arrived here, both ends were wide open and the only thing in the box was the blind itself. All of the mounting hardware was gone,no magnet or anything. This is the first time i've ever had a problem with any orders I have ordered through amazon and to my surprise the lady representing amazon was very friendly and helpful and they are sending me a new blind out right away. Hopefully this one will be at least taped up so the box ends wont come open LOL. But cudos to the amazon staff for such friendly service. Thank You. I will update my review (like anyone cares) LOL when I finally recieve all of the parts."
1,cheezy and doesn't stay put,"Out of the box, these weren't impressive, with the left side of the blinds hanging a bit lower than the right.But wait, there's more.The magnets aren't very strong.When I raised the blinds, I found that you have to hold on to the top piece to keep the blinds from coming off the door.So off the door they went; back to Amazon.Good idea, very poor implementation.I ended up with some Levelor 0170056 blinds. They're a little skinnier and require you to drill 4 holes and use sheet metal screws. But they're made better and will stay put."
3,"Work as Advertised, but are Low Quality","This product should cost no more than $20 for the full blinds, or $15 for the half blinds. The miniblinds are very low quality. I am planning to buy some better blinds and just use the magnets that came with these to mount them to my door. I wish this company just sold the magnets with no blinds."
4,Magnetic Half Blind,"This blind works great - easy to install, it lets plenty of light in when opened and gives complete privacy when closed. This door is our main entrance and the magnets are proving to be strong enough to keep it in place even with all of the opening and closing."
5,Blinds are easy,These are super easy to install and perfectly sized. The upper magnets are strong but the bottom ones could be a little stronger.
2,pretty flimsy,"The magnets hold well but the aluminum slats are very flimsy and I dont think they will hold up too long. Its easy to bend the slats when you walk out the door if you are not careful, or if the wind is blowing hard enough they bend. Right now they bend back into place but not sure how much of this they will take before they are permentely bent. This is like the cheapest aluminum blind you can buy at Walmart or Home Depot only it has the magnet hangers packed in with it. Not worth the price..."
1,"Defective product, broke within a week","I bought this product for my mother for Christmas. We put it up on her door the day after Christmas. On January 1 I noticed the blinds were lopsided. A string keeping one side of the blinds up where you twist the rod to open/close the blinds had frayed and snapped. The blinds are now useless, with less than a week of hardly any use. Unfortunately my mom threw away the box they came in so I can't return the item.Total waste of money."
5,Love it!!!!,"LOOOOOOVE my magnetic blinds :-D... They were very easy to install and they look great!!! Very strong magnet too, so when I open and close the door the blinds do not swing back and forth and it stays in place!!! It also made my livingroom look soooooo much better!!!! I def recommnend!!!!"
3,Just buy what you need,"You will not be needing all of this stuff, and most if it will get in the way when you do need something. You are better off buying a regular digital thermometer with removal tips that the whole family can use. Good luck giving medicine to a baby with a spoon. Just get a syringe (most meds for babies will come with one). The Booger Sucker (I know that's not its official name) is absolutely useless. Read that again, 100% useless. Go buy one of those giant ones in the store. You don't need the little flap to clean one out, just fill it with soapy water and squeeze until empty.I think this is seen in the store with the Red Cross logo, and it attracts new parents like flies to a bug zapper."
3,Works best on-the-go,"The only things I ended up using (partly because my baby hasn't gotten sick) were the rattle and nail files. The nail clippers couldn't cut his nails even when they were really long. I liked the scissors though, very sharp."
2,Waste of money,"I registered for this item thinking it would be handy to have all of these items. The only items that have been useful are the comb and brush, which I could've purchased separately. The nasal bulb is so stiff it's practically unusable and the nail clippers were dull. If you are looking for a good all-around healthcare/grooming set - look elsewhere."
1,Arrived with missing parts; poor customer service,"This item was gifted to me through my registry and arrived with two missing pieces - the nail clippers and the thermometer. I emailed the retailer (not Amazon) to learn how returns work with a registry item and never heard back. It wasn't worth my time and effort to follow-up again, so I just bought the missing items separately, which I should have done for all the parts in the first place. The kit is low-quality and incomplete - skip it!"
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I thought this would be incredibly useful for my new baby but I was wrong! All of the items inside are junk! The only item I was able to use is the hairbrush. The aspirator is too hard to squeeze, the nail clipper is impossible to use on little fingers and the comb is way too rough to ever use on a baby's head. I would suggest buying only the items you need from another company."
1,Poor quality - buy items separately.,The nasal aspirator is garbage - doesn't work and caused my son's nose to bleed. Same goes for the nail clippers - they cut him as they don't position well for small fingers. The medicine measurer is useless as medication you buy already comes with this. You can use any comb/brush for a baby. The rattle was mildy entertaining. Waste of money.
5,great product and extremely useful,Product is great and comes in handy. I have found most items useful especially the nail cutter and the hair brush which is so soft. Other stuffs in the package come in handy as baby grows. I think its a great product.
3,ok,"Good basic set, but there are better ones out there. These are rather flimsy and break easily. Clippers didn't work at all."
3,nice but pricey,"I Thought the contents will be made out of better quality materials, and they're quite cheap...I am disappointed with the thermometer on particular because it only reads on fahrenheit and I live outside US so we use celsius, but it was my mistake not to read it specifications first."
1,I have not received these items need information about this request thanks,I have not received these items need information about this request thanksI have not received these items need information about this request thanks
1,Total Waste of the Plastic It's Made Of,"This is the worst kit of anything I have ever owned. The comb and hairbrush are the only items that aren't too cheaply made to work.- The nasal bulb no suction what so ever.- The scissors don't cut.- The nail clippers are crap.- The medicine measure isn't needed because, really, any medicine you purchase for your child comes with a measuring/dosage device.- The cheap thermometer in mine is at least three degrees off and inconsistent (tested by taking my own temperature), if you can get it to work at all.- The toothbrush is total crap and not made for babies.I cannot emphasize how disappointed you will be if you purchase this or receive it as a gift.Instead of buying this, purchase yourself a good thermometer, baby nail clippers and a decent nose-sucker (either the bulb type or fancy aspirator)."
1,A collection of useless junk,"I know the title sounds dramatic, but it truly is all useless- and some dangerous! I put this item on my registry because I thought it was the perfect catch-all for me as a first-time expectant mom. I didn't know what I'd need so I loved the idea of a kit that came with everything. And signed off on by the American Red Cross? Even better.Well, I use the brush.The rattle is okay.The nail clippers are extremely dangerous and I cut my daughter's finger quite badly. The way the clippers are constructed, the finger tip is obstructed from view. There are many reviews to this effect here on Amazon for the clippers.[...]The aspirator doesn't work -it's way too hard to squeeze. Instead we use the one the hospital gave us.The nail files are too weak to file properly.I've never used anything else in there and my daughter is 6 1/2 months old.The First Years American Red Cross Sure-Grip Nail Clippers - 2 Pack"
2,Would rather buy items seperately,"This kit does have a lot of useful items, but they are not high quality and don't all work properly. For instance, the nasal aspirator was nearly impossible to squeeze rendering it useless. The nail clippers got rusty after being exposed to boiling water.The measuring spoon with the stopper was helpful in drop feeding my son for a couple of days.Overall, I'd rather spend a bit more and buy higher quality items individually."
2,nice but not very useful,"all you'll need really is the hair brush and the piles. the clipper is not easy to use, I bought the safety grip nail clipper separately."
5,Great for pregnancy!,"If you are pregnant and/or suffer lower back pain, this pillow is the BEST!!! I'm 7 months pregnant and I take it with me EVERYWHERE! I use it in the car, on my chair at work, in restaurants, at the movie theater, at home... If I let the air out of it, it's small enough to roll up and fit inside my purse. I start with it fully inflated when I use it and then let out air a little bit until it's perfect for wherever I'm sitting. After using this product I don't think I would be satisfied with lumbar support that's not adjustable. Plus, being made by Therm-a-Rest, this product is top quality. It is very durable. If you've never used a Therm-a-Rest product, know that it's virtually impossible for the air to leak."
2,good but not good enough,"This self inflating part of this pillow is a very useful feature. It would be completely useless without that feature in my opinion. I bought it to use it in the car which has no lumbar support. However, how comfortable you feel from this pillow is directly related to your body size and weight. For me his pillow is too small to be supportive to use in the car. Also, it has not strap so it does not stay in place when you get in and out of the car. I finally gave it up in a week trial."
3,Pretty good item,"Needs a pillow case, costs too much, but more or less one of the better ones out there. I took mine to India, Afghanistan all over the US. Worked fine. I lost it in the Middle East and bought another one."
5,A Great Little Pillow that Works Wonders!,"My mom was in desperate need of a pillow to support her lower back as she sat in the chair because of her loss in weight. All the typical pillows she used would eventually get too soft and not really work. For Christmas she put a new pillow on the list and I decided to check out what Amazon had. I ended up purchasing this pillow for her and she absolutely loves it. I personally questioned how much it could work because it looked very small, but don't let the size fool you. When this pillow gets old we know where to come back from another one because it has helped her out that much. Thanks Amazon!"
5,GREAT House-song,This is really a great house song and I'm sure we'll be hearing it all the summer on every house-party.So let's enjoy it and have fun...
3,Some redeemable moments,"While the greater first half of the movie is more than a bit cheesy, not to mention less than exciting, the performances and plot toward the end become interesting as self-conscious 'acting' and the slightly goofy dialogue scenarios give way to a suspenseful climax. Without going into specifics (who needs spoilers?) it does end a little too clean and neat. You don't 'have to' see this movie and I wouldn't go so far as to recommend it, but I've seen worse."
2,A Book for Mature Audience,"I hadn't thought much of the book through most of it, however, toward the very end an event happens that touched me deeply. It's quite hinted at that something dreadful took place and before I got to the unveiling of that, I didn't know if I could continue reading this and thankfully, quickly realized I was on the wrong track.I ache at the unfairness of it. Yes, the occurrence itself was sad, however, the resulting consequence to a particular individual did not seem fitting.Giving it 2 stars doesn't seem fitting either and yet most of the story was quite prosaic. Not much happening except day-to-day events of the young main character. However, the climactic event really peaked it out. At that point, it had an Of Mice and Men feel to it, hence the mature audience bookshelf."
5,Excellent book (not for children),"Great book, but a warning is issued in the following excerpt on page 1: ""If I tried to tell them this story, the one I am about to set down here, their parents would send me warning looks over the heads of the children. Don't, the looks would say. Stop.""Parents, pay attention to the words of advise."
4,"great story, NOT a children's book","This is the fourth book I've read by this author, and I've enjoyed all but Messenger. (That seems like a weak retry to tell a similar story to the wonderful Giver.)I'd say this about all her books, but most especially this one: This tale is NOT for children. I know that a lot of today's children know most ""adult secrets"" by the age of six or seven, but nevertheless this book is just too strong. A child who can ""handle"" its story line will probably be too jaded to be moved sufficiently by it, and an innocent child shouldn't be allowed to read such a haunting, innocence-destroying book. This is really an ""adult"" book about child characters, and at that it excels."
3,A Teen's Review,"I have been a fan of Lowry's ever since I read The Giver five years ago and I try to read all of her books, and have not been disappointed with one yet.However, I will say this is not one of her excellent ones. Do not get me wrong, it still is very good but I felt that it jumped quite a bit. She used pictures as a pretext for her chapters but it made it feel as if that's the only reason she went that direction. I feel as if she picked the pictures before writing, which I believe was a mistake.Also, for the book, the true ending, or where the climax began was in the last twenty pages of the book. It also felt a little abrupt, and I believe that it should have been gently eased into it a little better.The book is worth a look at, especially if you like early 1900 books. The character are (as always) portrayed fantastically and you really sympathize with them all.I recommend this book for any Lowry fans or early 1900 America fans."
4,A story grandchildren should hear,"Silent Boy reminds me of stories my mother or grandmother could have told me. I especially liked the beginning in which Katy tells the story as an old woman, but remembered from a child's perspective. The main character, Katy, wants to tell this story to her great-grandchildren, however, the parents would send warning looks over the children's heads saying, Don't! This is why I feel the plot could have been developed on a more adult level. I'm not really sure to whom Katy is speaking-to children or adults. Silent Boy kind of gives me feeling of A Painted House or To Kill a Mockingbird combined with a little of The Other. I'm not sure Silent Boy will hold the interest of the intended audience, but it is a story that any grandmother could and should tell."
3,not her best work,"I've read other Lois Lowry books, all of which are stronger than The Silent Boy. It's a nice story, with a thoughtful twist ending, but pretty slow through most of the chapters. We don't see enough of the title character to justify the book being named after him. I would like to have gotten to know him better. And there are segments of description of the setting that weigh the story down rather than enhancing it. It was a nice, light read, but pretty weak overall, especially in the characterization of the silent boy himself. Great ending though. Really nicely played out."
3,Good read,"I enjoyed this book. They make an effort to describe the age and the difference between Richard II and Henry IV. They spend some time on the poems, but not as much as I thought they would. They spend a lot of time describing the downfall of Richard. The ruthlessness of Henry and his new government underline the power and its pursuit.I gave it fewer stars because it was repetitive."
1,Worthless without online images!,"I was excited about getting this book, but soon realized that you needed to download specific images from the Kevin Ames website in order to perform any of the exercises. I went through the website registration process and am still unable to enter the lesson images. A real disappointment!"
2,Who is this book really for??,"This book would make you believe that you are going to photograph women, and they will throw Photoshop into the pot somehow. but its another rehash on how to use Photoshop to manipulate photos scanned into your computer.Im not sure who this book is for since most professional photographers don't have to do as much manipulation of their photos as presented in the book.Its not photography when you re-do the entire image from top to bottom!There are better books out there that accomplish the same thing, so I would have to say ""pass"" on this dog."
3,"visually appealing, but not the best tips","I almost bought this book at a book store after flipping its pages. It has great formating - good combination of diagrams, colored pages and filled with beautiful pictures of women.BUT, if you read in detail and try to follow its tips, you'll find it go through many laborious steps to do simple things. There's a section on archiving that barely talks about how to archive efficently. THere is also a section detailing how you can retouch photo of a bikini clad girl to look like barbie doll. I find the final picture appauling.There are also sections on how to trim thighs, remove facial blemishes etc. However, there is another book I owned called ""Photoshop Restoration and Retouching"" - by Katrin Eismann, that does a better job on retouching. I strongly recommend Katrin's book if you're a serious photographer. That book has a much wider range of tips and the steps are easier to follow."
1,Very amusing..,"Well, this book is worth owning for amusement value. While there are some overly complex methods of achieving a result that works, most of the information is simply beginner jargon. How to make a girl into a barbie chapter is simply a must see for laughs."
5,A must have for the bath!,"I am a big fan of simple toys that let kids use their imagination, and this toy fits the bill! My 2 year old twins love this toy at tubbie time! Sometimes the ducks are racecars, sometimes they are all brothers or sisters, and my kids have practiced saying their colors with this toy! I love that there are 3 baby ducks (less fights since there's plenty to go around) and that they all can be stored inside mama duck. Just be sure to shake them out after bathtime is over to get the excess water out. A great buy!"
2,Very challenging to open and get the ducks back inside,"My 16 month old daughter loves ducks. This toy was fun at first, but the back of the mother duck is very hard to open, even for me. Once it's open, she leaves it open which causes it to fill with water. The little ducks are easily lost in a bubble filled tub. So the mother duck gets most of the action. Overall it's not that great a toy. It's stiff and hard for wet hands to manuever."
5,"COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THE RECIPES, A+++!!","I am so happy that I stumbled across this book when searching for a southern dessert cook book. I couldn't wait to get it in the mail and quickly went through it to try the first recipe that stood out. I made the down home bred pudding and it was fantastic!!Instead of using regular rum, I used hazelnut liquer and it turned out much better than I could have expected. I also tweaked the measurements here and there because my family loves a ""wet"" bread pudding.So needlesstosay, I've been asked to make this for Thanksgiving as the main dessert! I can't wait to try the rest of the recipes. If they are any where close to this one, I'm sure they will all taste amazing!!"
3,Would not be my first choice of books,This book wasn't for me. I was looking for a sweets book with homemade southern recipes and what I received was a book that uses boxed cake mix. Now that is fine if that's what your into but I was really hoping for made from scratch down home stuff. That aspect really turned me off and soured the whole book for me. The stores were absolutely amazing and I felt that I was part of the Piner family but I just wished for more. There were alot of pictures of people but not too many pictures of the actual food. I had hoped for me but...
4,Great cookbook,"Shipped really really fast,the book was in good shape,very pleased with the book very informative,can not wait to try some of the recipes."
1,A Family History,"This book is a family history book as much as a cookbook. I was expecting really southern desserts, and while there were some of those, there were also the recent additions to the culinary world of ""doctored"" cake mixes and those recipes can be found in a number of other cookbooks. The book was a big dissapointment since old black and white pictures of people whom I don't know holds very little interest for me."
3,Soul Food Dessert Cookbook,I think this is the last book that I have purchased that I have not opened. Just really had time to cook like this but hopefully one day things will ease up. If and when I do I will try and come back to rate correctly.
3,I think is fine,I haven't tried many recipes so far. The most commented recipe is with sweet potatoe and I dont have much fans of it so I haven't done it.The boiling cookies and molases cookies where nothing but normal cookies. Nothing to be amazed. Please recommend me a recipe from it to try on and really be amazed of.
5,Words Can't Describe It,This book is so awsome!!! I bought it at a school book fair and I fell in love with it the minute that opened it. My kids and I try a new recipe at least once every other week. I can't get enough of it. I strongly encourage anyone (especially African-American families) to have one of these cookbooks in their household. I almost wish that I could have grown up in the Pinner family so that I could have enjoyed all of that good cooking! This book is truly a keeper!!!!!
5,Fantastic Recipes and Entertaining Stories,I absolutely love this book. I have made two of the recipes so far and they are wonderful! I have read the whole book and was enchanted by all of the stories; they add so much and give you a real feeling for the family and the ladies that made these recipes. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to bake or just loves to read family stories.
4,Great book,"I made the cream cheese pound cake and everyone loved it. However, some measurements in other ecipes seem to be a little off."
4,Great & Classic Cookbook,This is a must for your cookbook collection.The recipe for sweet potato pie is the best I have ever tasted & tried!!!
4,Yum!,"Though I haven't cooked anything from this cookbook yet, it's been a great read! Can't wait to cook some of the delicious-looking cakes!"
2,This is a big disappointment,"We purchased this ""weather station"" so we could easily read the outdoor temperature from indoors. We mounted it on a north window in the shade. It is completely inaccurate. When our other thermometers read 35 degrees, this one reads 29 degrees. When our other thermometers read 54 degrees, this one may read 60 degrees etc. (We have tested the other thermometers against boiling and freezing water and they are accurate.) We will have to look for a better item since this one is worthless for our purposes."
4,A wonderful weather station,This is good. You're looking for a temperature thing that also has a dial that tells you the humidity (whatever that is) then this your thing. It will stick to your window real good too. I like it. It tells me whether I need to wear a sweater or not. Buy it.
4,You can make your own for cheaper at home,"You can make your own for cheaper at home1.5 lbs of burdock root powder1 lb of sheep sorrel powder0.25 lb of slippery elm powder1 oz of Turkish rhubarb root powderOptional, but can be more effective:1 oz wartercress1 oz kelp powder1 oz blessed thistle1 oz red clover herbMix these ingredients thoroughly and store in glass jar in dark dry cupboard.Take a measuring cup, use 1/4 cup of herb mixture to 4 cups of water depending on the amount you want to make. (eg: 1 cup of herb mixture in a gallon of water)Use a glass pot. Boil hard for 10 minutes (covered) then turn off heat but leave sitting on warm plate over night (covered).In the morning heat steaming hot, then strain through fine strainer into glass bottles and sit to cool. Store in refrigerator.Basic single daily does: 1/8 cup herbal tea diluted in 1/8 cup hot water, taken on an empty stomach (at bedtime or when you get up.)"
5,Blind Dachshund with Lymphoma,"I followed the preparation instructions EXACTLY. I calculated how much I needed to give to my 16 pound dachshund and we are off!!! She has been on Essiac Tea, as well as other natural cures, and has stabilized. The tea keeps excellently in sterilized jars and kept in the frig. She doesn't mind the taste either."
4,a miracle tea,"One our Pugs, 9 years old, developed Breast cancer. We started with giving 1 TBS twice a day, 2 hrs after breakfest and the other TBS at bedtime. When our hollistic veterenarian found the Cancer the spot was almost 2 1/2"" in diameter, now it shrinked to the size of a quarter in a period of 2 months.My wife and decided to take 1 TBS at night as a prevention against cancer as well."
1,Expensive and doesn't do anything,"I purchased this as a last resort to treat my cat's jaw cancer. It didn't seem to make any difference, or slow the tumor growth. I should have known it was too good to be true, but I was willing to try anything. This was just a waste of money, and was miserable for the cat (it stinks and tastes horrid). She only lived two months with the Essiac treatment from the time of diagnosis. Incidently, according to the Essiac website this product is probably counterfeit. Perhaps if I'd had the real Essiac it may have made a difference."
3,Too small for tall people,"Even though I purchased a ""large"" pack it is too small for someone who, like myself, is over 6 ft. tall. I am a couple inches over 6 ft. and if the hip belt is used properly then the shoulder straps are at least a couple inches too low in the back - so that they have to come up and over my shoulders. Also, the pack seems too small to have enough carrying capacity for a four night backcountry trip at higher altitudes or in colder weather, even if you are using lightweight techniques. The pack appears to be well made but also seems to suffer from an overabundance of straps - a common characteristic of most packs sold today."
4,Good for the money,"Item arrrived as everyone elses, with the parts scattered all around. The plastic case does not hold the bits enough to turn it upside down, but I don't know why anoyone who would do it. The bits are descent, and what you would expect for under $40. This was a replacement for the GMC drill bit set that was stolen, which had a much slimmer case,and better designed case. All in all, I am happy with it."
4,Poor packaging for shipment,"The selection of items is great and they seem to be of good quality. However, it was shipped with absolutely no packing materials. When it arrived, it took about 30 minutes to sort out all the bits that had come loose and put them in their proper place. The two bits that became lodged in the hollow base were quite a challenge to get out."
2,Denali 300 pc drill accessory set,There was no protective styrofoam around the case. It was just put in a box. Case is dented and cracked. Denali should have taped cardboard over the top of each drawer to prevent the bits from falling out. A lot of the bits were either stuck INSIDE the drawers or loose inside the case!! I haven't used the tools yet.
3,Denali 300-Piece drill,Until know I did not use this drill set but on the box are missing some drills. I do not remember if is 4 ou 5. Because that I give 3 star.Remember that this stuff was made on China.WagnerBaltimore-MD
3,"okay, but not high quality",Best thing about it is the box. Really keeps things organized. I will get a lot of use out of this set but the quality is definitely not the best. Probably a good deal for the money.
3,Arrived Damaged,"Case arrived damaged with tools all over the place, terrible packaging.Tool set is as described."
1,The most idiotic play I've ever seen,"My husband still hasn't forgiven me for buying this recording. I got it at a library sale for $2.00, and even that was too much to pay."
5,this is worth the money,"Yes this toy is fun,but the sails keep getting in the way.You might need to buy some war cheasts to have some ground battle.Overall this set is fun,has one dragon,3gold men,9green men, 3working canons and a crystal.Yes it takes a while to put together(expeshaly the cabon)but it is worth the efort.KEEP THE TORCHES AWAY FROM BABIES!"
3,Megabloks bad quality,Well. I bought this set thinking it would be nice. Well...I was wrong the ship is okay the warriiors are deatailed but BEWARE!!! They break. All three of the Draigar broka and the silver staff as well. Not only is this outragously priced considerinf all the above but a pain to assemble. One cusstomer wrote that it took faster that lego to assemble and that it needed NO adult help. Well he was wrong. I didn't need help but an 6-10 year old would definentliy need some. Trust me DON'T BUY THIS ITEM. BUY LEGOS AND GET BETTER QUILITY BY FAR. THE MEGABLOK DEATAIL IS NICE BUT FRAGILE. The only thing I'm finding usefull is the dragon.
5,Nice big boat for an excited customer,If u've read any of my reviews u'd kno that i'm all 4 Mega Bloks and all that and i would like 2 say on behaf of my siblings that this could be one of the best sets yet. The boat is very large and it is totally worth the price or more.
3,The Man-O-War!,"The man-o-war is a giant battleship. It comes with 2 working cannons and 1 working harpoon launcher! There is also one dragon called Midgaard. There are 9 Norvagen warriors and 3 Draigar warriors. There is also a prison cell which can open and close. The sails are made of real cloth! Although the pieces don't click easily, this toy is the greatest apart from Dragon Mountain, part of the Fire and Ice series. In total, there are 12 warriors. This is one of the greatest sets in the Krystal wars series. Also, in Fall, look out for the Dragons Fire and Ice <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=movie&v=56"">movie</a> and <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=toys&v=56"">toys</a>. They are already selling some Fire and Ice sets at <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=amazon&v=56"">amazon</a>.com (...)"
4,Coolness,"This ship is so cool. You can do so much stuff with it in so many ways. And the cool part is, it's as fun to make as it is to play with!"
5,Great Buy!!!,"This is the first and only Dragons set I have so far,and I hope I get some for my Birthday.This set comes with everything you need to have a real adventure!It has a Prisoner cage,two cannons,one harpoon launcher,9 Norvagen warriors,3 Draigar warriors(all the warriors are very detailed),and a huge Sea Dragon.I have NO complaint about the pieces falling off(except for maybe the torches).I would reccomend this as a great set a birthday gift.Overall this is a great toy for 8 and above(beware parents may find themselves playing along with their children)."
5,Best Dragons Set Yet,I was so excited to see this set when they originally previewed it on the Mega Blok site. It has lived up to my expectations and more. The ship is the sturdiest Dragons set with tons of play value. Tremendous detail from the cloth sails to the shooting cannons.
5,Buy this book....'cause it's good!,"This book is really exciting and funny. You will laugh your head off! I liked it because there are lots of twists and turns and funny parts. (nephew's review, 10 years old)"
4,Great For the Yonger Harry Potter want -to -be fans,"My son loves this whole series of books. He is nine years old and quite capable of reading Harry Potter, yet he prefers this series. A great summer read!"
1,doesn't play,"I'm unable to change this review to a 5. I am changing what I previously wrote.I had stated not to buy it because it wouldn't play and originally rated as 1. I called the phone number for the manufacturer that was on the order form in the enclosed booklet. Within 10 minutes they had told me the file to change and the game started right up.Reel Deal Slots Vol II is terrific. If you like slots you should like this. It's got 40 different slot machines and 5 video poker games. The graphics, the bonus screens, and the variety is great. The bonus screen for 'grave robbers' lets you pick which tombstone you want. Out of 7 stones: 5 have money, 1 advances to the next 7 tombstones, and 1 will stop your winnings and go back to the slot machine. I haven't played all the machines yet.The game usually lets you win. If you're losing or bored, just change to another slot machine. I wish Vegas had these odds."
3,"Sometimes beautiful, sometimes dull","Basically, this Roman Trilogy handled by Yan Pascal Tortelier doesn't live up to Charles Dutoit's excellent rendition. Not to say that it fails miserably, it still makes a good performance. The Philharmonia is one of my favorite orchestras, and I'm sorry to say that the players do not really give out their all in this one. Pini di Roma and Fontane di Roma do not sound so fresh and energetic, but Feste Romane is as enthusiastic as Dutoit's version. Compared to this, I'll always go for Charles Dutoit, and leave this one on the shelf if I'm in the mood for a softer Roman Trilogy."
3,Nice toy but not completely realistic,"We like that all the foods are fruit and vegetables but a few of the sizes and colors are competely off. For instance, the watermelon is purple instead of pink. Also, there is a bunch of bananas that is smaller than a tomato and a strawberry that is almost the same size as a pineapple."
2,Same item $20 cheaper T big lots,I was pleased with my purchase until I saw the same item at big lots for $5. Hate that I wasted that much. I'd recommend finding something similar elsewhere.
5,Wonderful toy,"We decided on this item since it is fruits and veggies, instead of fries and other unhealty items. We are trying to teach our child how to eat good and healthy but finding play food that matches that can be a challenge at times. This basket solves that issue. Cute and healthy, what more could you ask for!"
5,"Great, Healthy food","Top quality and very healthy compared to the McDonald, Burger King, Pizza Hut food available at our local Toys R Us. I am so happy with this. My 17 month old son is obsessed with Ba-na-na's and he runs around with it all the time. Can't say enough good about it"
4,Teach Children Patriotism,"Modern Day Heroes gives positive support for political leaders, military and community people who have defended our freedom abroad and worked to maintain safety at home. This book can be a reference for parents who want to teach their children about our era, an important period in history. It is a good snapshot of modern heroism to build patriotism and unity.Christine McClungAuthor,Epic Heroes-Dinner Talk for Champions"
5,"Great photos, interesting info!","This book is great! It has some great photos, and the info in the book is very interesting! I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Well-worth buying if you love London!"
5,A timeless Classic,"This book was a gift to my great, great grandmother, shortly after it was written. She presented it, around 60 years later, to my very young mother. Since then, my great grandmother, grandma, mother, and uncle have read it. Eight years ago, when I was five, the century old, dog eared book was presented to me. I laughed, pondered and smiled with the book and Mabel. This child's story is a must-read for any one who is young, or young at heart."
4,Oodles of Doodles,"Fun game!!! Makes you think. A little challenging for younger kids, but if they team up with an older person, it is a blast."
4,Great for the kids,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my neices and nephew, 11, 9 and 6. They loved the idea of the game, but a lot of the cards contained items to draw that they didn't have any idea what the items were. I do know that the age recommendation is 10 and up, so it is to be expected that the younger ones will have some difficulty. Additionally, trying to draw all 8 pictures within the time limit was difficult, even for some of the adults. We took turns just drawing the pictures and having everybody guess rather than doing the competition. But all the kids loved the drawing. Would definitely recommend."
5,A Story from the heart of the author,"A psychic and medium, McCall's main character, Laurel Scanlon, mirrors the experience of many of us with similar gifts who grew up in the Midwest. Laurel faces people who fear her when she tries to warn them of impending danger and the results are tragic. She finds support from a man and knowledge of the origin of her gifts when she moves to the old family homestead in Louisiana. A well respected psychic, her recently deceased grandmother paves the wave for her acceptance.I found the book to be fast moving, believable and suspenseful. I also felt a good deal of the author's heart and soul in it. A good read."
3,An interesting read,"I am familiar with this author's other books. She usually provides an enjoyable read, not too mind boggling and not terribly memorable, but a good way to pass the afternoon. This book exemplifies her work. I enjoyed the characters, the plot and the slight mystery. I did NOT enjoy the unnecessary (explicit) sex screens."
3,"Readable, but not great","I found this story to be a little ridiculous, but I was able to read through it pretty quickly. I enjoyed it to a point, but I found the fact that the sex started between the hero and heroine before they met (in some type of ghost like state...) and then again right after they met a little ridiculous. Sex is not romance. I don't mind reading some steamy scenes in a book, but for goodness sake, let a real relationship develop first. Maybe her ""sight"" was just too much for me too. I still give it three stars because it held my interest enough to keep me reading to the end."
1,Don't Waste Your Money Or Time!,"I am usually a big fan of books by Dinah McCall (aka Sharon Sala), but this time, I was very disappointed. The story was very weak and I did not find the romance between Laurel and Justin believable. I mean, they have sex seconds after meeting each. How believable is that? I wish McCall would have spent more time developing their relationship and not have them jump into bed right away. Overall, the book was a big bomb and a waste of money and time. Don't bother!"
2,Didn't Like It,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book. I didn't know it was about the paranormal. It was well written (that's why I gave it two stars) but I'm just not into ghosts, ESP, etc. and the love affair was just to unbelievable even if it had been a normal romantic suspense book."
2,Pleaseeeeeee...,"I really tried to like this book. Don't know how many times I put it down and picked it back up because I was hoping that it would get better. Usually love this author but this book was...for a lack of a better word...""DUMB"" with a capital D!Can't believe the reviews that say ""thrilling""...Pleaseeeee!"
3,Slow Toast,This toaster looks nice and works well as an oven but as a toaster it is VERY slow. We replaced a cheap black and Decker we had for 15 years and the whole family complains about how slow it toasts. It takes 5 minutes to get light toast. We just timed it so this is not an exaggeration.
2,Works-but.,"When the size of the unit was given in the web ad, they must be giving the package size. the overall size isn,t close to stated. Crumb tray is a joke not removeable. Wear an oveglove when using so you can hold unit and try to adjust so called control knobs. Spend a few more bucks and get another brand !!!Glenn."
4,very cute clock tower,"My son loves this piece because he pretends Diesel 10 is falling into the river like in the ""Thomas and the Magic Railroad"" movie. It's a very cute piece and is easy to fit into a layout because there's no crossing track underneath. The clock hands move and the drawbridge raises with the turn of the tower too. Lots of fun!"
3,Hell and Our Belief System,Less of a novel than its prequels and more like a theological treatise. Lots of info that could be used as reference. Didn't realize that so much of our belief system hinged on our understanding of hell.
4,interesting,"i wouldn't recommend a new mclaren reader touch this book until ""a new kind of christian"" has been read twice and thought about for a year. the book makes some statements that are very questionable and would be cause to get rid of the book except for the wonderful implications that come from them. grace and love are the keys to this book and it provides oppurtunity to see how grace and love can be played out in real life. there is much talk of social justice, which is a much needed topic here in america.the point of the book is deconstructing the idea that escaping hell is not the point of christianity, and readers should go into it realizing that if they take what is said about hell in the book theologically as the main thrust (which many evangelicals will do) then the book will be worthless, but if they look for what is said about life when escaping hell isn't the purpose then they may profit hugely."
1,Not much here,"The real problem with McLaren's work is not that it is heretical, it's that he's just making stuff up and thinking of himself as a revolutionary. Not of his doctrine is at all new, and he isn't even particularly radical. Maybe if you've had your head in conservative Christian sand all of your life you'll think that he has something new to say, but probably not. This is just shallow."
1,"DUPER, HIMSELF DUPED, DUPING GULLIBLES","THIS MAN IS A DUPER. HIMSELF DUPED, HE IS UNWITTINGLY DUPING GULLIBLES.THE REAL HELL JESUS PREACHES IS HORRENDOUS BEYOND BELIEF. LET'S GET BUSY LOVING PEOPLE OUT OF HADES. LET'S LOVE & GOSPEL THEM OUT OF GEHENNA BY CHRIST'S BLOOD SACRIFICE ON THE CROSS INSTEAD OF WRANGLING THE BIBLE OUT OF CONTEXT AND CONCOCTING NEW PLACEBOS OF EASY BELIEVISM.LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE DUPED. IF THE BLIND LEAD THE BLIND, WON'T BOTH FALL INTO A PIT?"
1,Doesn't cut it; insults the Bible and Christian intelligence,"This filibuster's rated one dim star.It smokes like a tobaccoless cigar.All God-fearing hell-preachers long to beCompassionate in warning souls who fleeA fiery Hades by Christ's unpretense.If hell's mere mythic metaphor, what denseAlarmists still perpetuate dire woeOf paradise-abyss where demons goInto the netherworld of bliss below?"
5,Still Figuring It Out,"Brian McLaren has written a delightful tale full of thought-provoking questions and thoughts that helps all readers examine what the Bible actually says about God, salvation, and the after-life. McLaren says that asking questions like, ""Is there a hell?"" or ""Who is going to hell?"" are the wrong kind of questions. The Bible doesn't deal with these questions. Instead, McLaren believes, that we should be asking, ""Who is God?"" and ""How does he deal with us?"" Many will read this book and disagree. Others will feel that McLaren has paved a new path for evangelical Christianity. In the end, I think it must be said that McLaren helps us to explore what the Bible says and what it does not say. He does not try to formulate theological systems but is content with the mystery, suprise, and poetic artistry of the Biblical language. This is an honest book from a person who is exploring his faith and helping others to do so as well."
4,Many Christians don't know Jesus...,"I have found the last of the NKOC books to be challenging and affirming. It's refreshing to me as someone who has always felt out of place in the typical southern evangelical traditions I have assosciated with in the past to wrestle with issues that I have done so for so long. Religion sure gets folks riled up and Mr. McLaren at least encourages people to think about things - can't say that about much of the so-called ""Christian"" literature."
5,Scholarly and Engaging,I am in the middle of McLaren's latest book which completes the trilogy. I am so impressed with his knowledge of history in general and church history in particular as he tells his story concerning a better understanding of the concept of Hell. I so appreciate his sincere attempt to be faithful to the Bible while bringing his readers a view that goes beyond the traditonal understanding of Hell. Thanks Brian.
5,Turn from burn,"Talking about a discovery! I was already going up into the first two books of the trilogy, but this one strikes all! 2000 years of Christianity influences by one of the hottest subject of religion, Hell. Suddenly you're walking along with pastor Dan and Neo to discover the revealing truth about the Gates of Hell. You might wanna leave this book for what it is if you're all too sure about what you believe, but this book gives you something to think about. If this doesn't grab you... The gospel is getting better and better."
2,Not Sure,"I think McLaren is refreshing in that he takes us into the faith with honest questions. He is a relief to anyone who has gone to a church where the preaching consisted of inflexible dogma that didn't allow for questions. However, it's not really clear where McLaren ends up. If he casually adopts evolution and dismisses hell (in another book), exactly how does he make these theological decisions? What is his basis for deciding what is true and what isn't?Overall, I'd recommend this book to someone who had really been burned by church, but not to someone who had never been to church. I'm not sure that it would put seekers on the right path. Instead, I'd recommend James W. Miller's ""God Scent"" for seekers with authentic questions who didn't want an unbending viewpoint. Also Rob Bell's book."
4,A Coffee Table and Not a Pulpit.,"As an artist, I am immensely grateful for the New Kind of Christian trilogy. Brian McLaren steps away from brokering knowledge and chooses instead to ignite a conversation. There's humility here--a pastor who isn't looking for the last word in his writing. This book deserves careful study because though the chapters race by, the questions move in, find the spare rooms in our minds, and start unpacking their suitcases. They're going to be here a while."
1,NEW BRAND OF FAITH - WHAT not TO BELIEVE,"Markus Park and Neil Oliver represent emergent masters seeking disciples of the new brand of religious thinking in vogue today. ""We are done with being told the right received way we all ought to understand the gospel story. Something's missing. Big time.""""We declare the new brand christian no longer open to be evangelized re: what is to be believed about the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved. Today's and tomorrow's christian is hereby from now on only open to be informed by MarkusNeilMcLaren what NOT to believe. Check out our books for questions to all the big answers. Avoid all indoctrination.""P.S. ""Here's some recommended reading from experts on fresh believable options at the end of our books that will show you how to avoid what we've found to be NONbelievables based on our recent discoveries. Love, BrianNeilMarkus.""Seeker, you're on your own. Find your own believables."
1,redeemed and delivered from what?,"not recommended for the simple reason that God's word is clear about the hell we have been redeemed, ransomed, atoned, pardoned, reprieved, rescued, propitiated, purchased, forgiven, delivered from. the main reason Jesus is to be worshipped is the Lord saved us from the permanent state of hell we deserved and mercifully spared us from everlasting lostness in our punishable sins (sinning against an eternal God is an eternal unimaginable offense). Hallelujah! what a Saviour! a reconstructed hell is a misconstructed gospel and a destructed thislife and afterlife. one star is granted for showing the vital importance of the issue for thinking Christians. see the book 'Hell Under Fire' for material unfairly omitted in this overly contemporary consumer-friendly maltreatment. what we have here is like calling terminal cancer only a 24-hr cold needing nyquil not radical chemo/radiation/miracle remedy of cross-blood to cure."
1,Garbage,"Humor, not a travel guide or serious help with language. Eurocentric orientalistic racist cultural imperialistic oversimplification.Enjoy!"
5,pequeño y util,"muy bonito pequeño y útil... tiene buenas gráficas y esta bien explicado,, una buena guía para entomología y estudiantes,, no es a color,, pero es muy bueno"
3,Not Impressed,"I thought this would be a nice thing to have to tidy up the drives... Honestly, if you know your way around your OS & computer (above average user), you don't need this."
5,Michael Palin - New Europe,"Funny, informative, entertaining. Whenever Michael Palin takes us along to explore the world it's always an excellent adventure. Highly recommended."
3,"Not Bad, But you have to READ THE MANUAL","Not a bad camera for under $60. You do get what you pay for, but if you actually read the manual and learn how to use it some of the issues people complain about wont happen. 1. USE LITHIUM OR RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES WITH ANY DIGITAL CAMERA!!!!!! It does have a button to turn the display on and off to help save battery life, I have 4 other cameras and that is one of the first things you should learn. 2. The issue of washed out pics with the flash? Start with page 19 in the manual and then read page 20, it tells you how to correct it with the White Balance and the Exposure settings. Is this comparable to a Canon in quality? No, but it beats a Vivitar by a mile. It's a DECENT 3.1 megapixel camera, if you want more, then spend the extra $40 and get the Kodak."
2,Okay I Guess,"I Boght this camera for scouts, and it worked ok for outdoor pictures but the flash is to bright to use inside and if the rooms to dark you lose your picture. then this morning(a few mouths later) it died on me."
2,An outdoor camera,"Recently I bought a brand new camera with the complete sealed package from the web, however, the flash did not work at all. So now I used it to take only outdoor photos since I got it really cheap. I also realized that it worked fine only with alkaline batteries, and it used up at least two pack of regular AAA batteries a day when I tried to set up the menu."
2,"No Sir, I don't like it.","It eats batteries, had poor picture quality, and is very cheaply made. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because it is so inexpensive. Bought this at the Wal-Mart one evening and returned it the very next morning. Huge disappointment. My advice is that if your gonna spend your money on something as expensive as a digital camera, make it quality, name brand one."
2,OK as a Cheap Small Point and Shoot for Outdoors,"I too bought this thing at WalMart because I wanted something inexpensive. I found it takes reasonably decent outdoor photographs: blue skies with a bit of cloud come out particularly well. Its compactness, that it fits in a pocket, is nice.The labels for the buttons started rubbing off right away. It does seem susceptible to shakiness. The batteries do drain quickly. It needs an SD memory card to hold more than a few photos."
4,Karen sweats and so will you!,"A tough workout not for beginners. Cueing is quick. I found I had to do it about four times before I started getting some of the steps down. I like that the workout seems to go fast because of Karen's ""get down to business"" attitude. The longest cardio segment is in the beginning, 9:15 minutes, so you know you got the longest one out of the way after it is over. By then, I am very warm and in the zone. The moves are not dancy but I do find this tick-tock move she does a bit difficult. The aerobics alternating with the weights and then abs and butt really makes me feel like I have had a workout from head to toe."
3,Watch out low impact exercisers,"I appreciated all the reviews - helped me in selecting this tape. However, I have a weak knee so I do all my exercising without jumping or leaping. Karen claims to have representatives doing low impact, well I had to make a few modifications (nothing new). If I had to do it again, I'd buy something else, but will add it to my collection & just not use it as often. Otherwise it is a great workout if you like Karen's style."
2,"These suck after a while, but they are only 6$","Okay, I've had these for about 4 months...I used them everyday and now they don't work. I'm mad and I think these suck, but then again, they only cost 6$....just so you know, they won't last."
3,"Convenient, but Sound Quality Sucks!","The retractable feature and the clip attachment is very convenient. I travel a lot and usually keep my headphones in my pocket, where normal headphones get all tangled up and these do not. Unfortunately the sound quality sucks. There is no bass at all. Not that I was expecting Bose quality for less than ten bucks, but these will only be for temporary use until I find a better quality retractable set. BOTTOM LINE: Its money I should've put toward nicer ones."
1,This really Sucks,"The first time that i put on my ear they opened and leave to the view all the cables, this is a really disappointing product"
1,Item received not as descripbed,I just ordered this item and when I got it I was very dissapointed that it was not as described. The ear buds were different than the picture. The ear buds I got were flat and round which hurts your ear and they don't fit inside your ear like the ones shown in the picture. I am returning this item.
3,"Good sound, faulty locking mechanism","These earbuds worked great initially, and actually, as earbuds alone they're just fine. I'm not terribly picky (or discerning) when it comes to minute differences in sound quality, and they sound great to me. However, the retracting mechanism, which worked initially, won't lock very well anymore (this after 2-3 weeks of use). The cord will click at a given length as I pull it out, as though it's going to lock in place, but when I release the tension the cord just winds right back up (or it'll lock weakly and then snap back if anything touches it). If I hold the cord stretched out for a period of time it will often lock in place spontaneously, but even then it can rewind unpredictably. Overall, I'm still using these earbuds, but I'll be looking for another brand of retractable buds sooner or later."
2,Not Well Made,The molding around the ear bud quickly seperated leaving the copper wires exposed. Too bad as the retractable feature works well and the clip is great for working out. But poor workmanship is the issues here.
4,Zipline headphones,"Performed as expected, could be made better with volume control included, which I purchased separately, but other than that they work fine. Little clip to attach to shirt was broken on arrival but never needed it anyway, sound is a little tinny but satisfactory. Mechanism works good so far."
5,Excellent product,"Work wells, but it will deteriorate with use. The wire at the source of the plugs finally breaks as its twisted and bent with use. That's okay, and normal. My first one lasted a very long time, and I have another. Sound is not great, but acceptable."
1,Lasted one week...,"The retractable earphones worked for less than a week, about 4 uses at the gym. Earphone cables got jammed together and will not pull back out. Very poor design. Would not recommend."
2,Zip-Linq,"Got these on May 1st and already the right bud has quit working!Sound quality was great and the retractable feature also great but, without both buds working they're useless."
2,Unimpressed,Sound quality is pretty crappy compared to the other similarly priced (non-retractable) earphones. The rubber caps also seem larger than standard so they don't fit in my ears as well and as a result the noise cancelling is also non-existent
1,Received item not what's shown in picture,"I was a little hesitant to order due to so many feedbacks warning that they received a different item than what was pictured. I ordered 3 and while 2 of them were the correct ones, the third one was an older regular earphone, not the earbuds as the other two, and also shorter cords as it says on the packaging. The packaging of the earphone is also smaller and obviously looks different than the earbuds. I never thought Amazon would resort to this type of tactic. Shame on them."
4,energy inspiring percussion,As a fitness instructor I find myself popping this in again and again.The rhythym of this disc is inspiring and makes you want to move.
3,Drumsex,"While this album is very well done I find it repetitive and not as diverse as I would have liked it to be. I have listened to quite a few of Brent Lewis' albums and they all kind of sound the same. Brent Lewis certainly deserves respect for his talents but I find this cd and the other that I recently bought ""Pulse"" to be almost caged."
1,Mail-in-rebate scam,"If there are mail in rebates on the items you purchase, and if there is a clause like you have to mail in the form within a specific number of days from the purchase date, be assured, The Amazon and the product manufacturer makes sure that it arrives to your home after that day to make sure you won't submit your rebate form."
4,A good price on competent blank CD media,"The product is packaged in a durable plastic container which is easy to open and close and protects the CD blanks from dust, etc. The blanks are fine for general use although recording quality is enhanced by recording at less than the maximum speed of the CD burner as is the case with most brands of low cost CD blanks. Low incidence of defective media (one faulty disk encountered to date - ~50-60% of disks used). Media accepts a printed label well and contains space to support writing on CD with a marker. All in all I consider this product to be a good value for general use including archiving personal data files."
2,Haven't really had a problem but,"Haven't really had a problem but some of the disks have big blue blotchs on the writing surface. I was surprised when they burned OK, so maybe it is not really a defect.Edited 7/7/06: These really suck. About half will not burn. Of the half that did burn OK, half of those will not play. I didn't know they still made discs half this bad."
1,Bad experience,I've had a bad experience with these CDs. I just read a bad review for the 25pack and I've had similar issues. There is a problem when I burn these CDs and I've had to throw most of the ones I've tried to burn so far. I have never faced this problem with even CDs that seem to be of poor quality. I would not recommend these CDs to anyone.
5,First Robin recordings on CD....,"I bought this back at the dawn of the CD age. Think it was the first available Trower on CD.It is a nice collection of Trower songs from his 1970/1980 albums on Chrysalis and features Chrysalis' original CD mastering sound.Tracks are:1. Day Of The Eagle2. Bridge Of Sighs3. Too Rolling Stoned4. Shame The Devil (miscredited as ""Shame of the Devil""!)5. Fine Day6. For Earth Below7. Caledonia8. Pride9. Messin' The Blues10. Blue Bird11. Caravan To Midnight12. Victims Of The Fury13. Into Money14. Gonna Shut You Down15. Thin Ice16. Benny Dancer"
1,"*NOT* ""genuine Brother ink cartridge ""","Although the picture & description is of the Brother ink cartridge, the actual item shipped was a no-name ""compatible"" cartridge. It may work, I don't know, but the marketing is deceptive, and for a copy it's actually overpriced."
4,spinning entertainment,My infant was intrigued with the spinning bears on this toy (which will spin for a long time if you keep pumping after initiating a spin). Now that she is 9 months old she can finally set the bears spinning herself. It's fun to watch her try to figure out why/how the bears started/are spinning and how to stop them (flipping the toy on its side).
3,Enchanted Rock is best part of story,"The first half of this book was not half bad for its description of family life and mid-life crisis of the husband. E.J.'s, the wife, reaction to her missing husband, is pretty well written and seems true to life. The author loses me completely in Willis'story about his disappearance. When he has the chance to escape and doesn't; I completely lost interest. I detested the character of Rogene so much, it would have been alright with me for anything to have happened to her. Why Willis would want to help Tater and Rogene is completely baffling. And Tater is as much a criminal as the other bad guys in this book. E.J.'s cop friend Luna is also apparently stupid. She doesn't call for back-up when she goes to the turkey farm-truck stop. However, I gave this book a 3 because I did finish it and the story of the rock made up for the stupidity of the story. This rock sounds like a really interesting place to visit!"
4,Good.,"I did not consider this one to be as good as her first two. The first two I enjoyed very much! I could not put them down. Home Again, Home Again was good, but the switching back and forth between Willis' story and EJ's story put me off a little, especially since they were both written in the first person. It got to be confusing at times. Other than that, I would highly recommend the EJ Pugh series and I am eagerly waiting for her next book due out early next year."
5,Brilliant!,"I am using this pistol for a short film I'm doing. I got it a few weeks ago and it feels very realiztic. I've pulled the trigger many times and it hasn't broken. The screws do become loose after a while but it's super easy to tighten them back. Just keep an eye on them, especially if you're filming."
5,excellent!,"Great price great product!!! I received it within 2-3 days. It's in excellent condition, looks like the real thing and is a collectors item. I'm really happy with it.Thank you Amazon!!!"
3,disappointing,"I got this for my 8 year old son. It is neat and he is still proud of it, but it doesn't keep the time correctly and we are constantly resetting it. You'd think a watch would keep time, no matter all the other bells and whistles!"
3,could be way better,"A big hit... at first. The compass is inaccurate. We would still love it, as my 6 year old son thinks it is so cool, but It beeps every hour as loud as a smoke alarm losing battery power! It is so annoying, it wakes up the whole house. I called the company, they never called back. Would not recommend."
3,Good workout,"Upper body DVD stopped before the workout was finished. Something wrong with DVD and will need to return. Lower body workout was fine. Yet to do Abdominal DVD. Will see how that plays before returning the defective one.I have done these workouts before, and Suzanne Deason is easy to follow along with. Her exercises are precise, and you definitely see (and feel) a difference. Balance ball exercises are great for those with back issues."
2,Historical Fashion in Detail: The 17th and 18th Centuries,"It did not have most of the information I was seeking. I wanted to find info on the style of the time in detail. Although a few years had detail and were helpful for my needs, I was expecting to see more years be explained in detail by the title. It spent to much of the book talking about things that for my mind didn't tell what the fashion styles were. For the most part I found the book disappointing."
4,Great Closeups!,"This is a beautiful book. The quality of the photography, and the full page pictures are great. If they had zoomed in any closer you would see what it was like to be inside an individual stitch. The descriptions are short and simple. There are some diagrams done in line drawing about draping and pleating. It looses a star only because they didn't include a single zoomed out picture of any of the items. Imagine trying to get an idea of what a person looks like from head to toe, and the only thing you have to go on is a zoomed in color photo of one of their eyes and a line drawing of their frame. It is still a fabulous book. Certainly worth every penny!"
5,American animation done correctly!,"I wish they didn't end this series in 5 seasons. I used to think that Japanese animation was the only good animation. I now admit that I'm wrong. This series is entertaining, better than ""Batman: The Animated Series"", & keeps you wanting more after every episode. If I remember correctly, they even do some flashback episodes of Batgirl & Robin. They also do (one of my favorites), an episode of Batman in the future. Those episodes I just mentioned are some of the gems of this series.Most definitely this series is geared toward the younger crowd, but it also applies to the early adult audience (I'm in my 30's & enjoy it). Each season is reasonably priced (around $10.00 each @ this time I think) compared to Batman Beyond (which are ridiculously expensive; approximately $23 to $27.00 each). You won't regret buying this series!"
3,The 11 episodes that worked were great!,"I enjoy watching these 'The Batman DVD's with my 2, 4 & 6 year old children. Unfortunately episodes # 4 & 5 would not play on any of my three DVD players. The disc just made a continuous hideous screeching noise and the picture on the TV screen froze. I'm in the process of sending it back to Amazon for a refund. I'll plan to buy it somewhere else so that we can eventually see those 2 episodes.Episodes #1 through #3, as well as #6 through #13 were awesome. There wasn't near as much in the way of special features on this Season 2 set as there was on Season # 1."
5,Ancient Irish agricultural practices; implications for today,"In this book, Dr. Callahan shows how ""civilized"" insanity is turning Ireland away from her naturally harmonious, aesthetically pleasing, sound practices. Why remove a thatched roof, for example, to replace it with galvanized tin, only to increase the heating bill? With insightful wisdom, he also examines the mysterious power of round towers, ""magic spots,"" and the healers such as Biddy Early. His study of hedgerows, booley people and Ireland's traditional form of agriculture can teach everyone the value of the land and why not to carelessly destroy it with toxic chemicals. Softcover, 224 pages.Other books by Dr. Callahan: Exploring The Spectrum, A Walk in The Sun, and Paramagetism (Rediscovering Nature's Secret Force For Growth)."
5,gorgeous watch,"what a remarkably gorgeous watch this is. I saw it originally at Nordstrom's at a considerably higher price and feel in love with it. I checked Amazon and voila - there it was much, much lower in price, no tax and no shipping. It is indeed, slim, gold and glitz!"
4,Good.....i think,"Well i have the vinyl version which has 3 tracks world around, usher and JAY - one of the best tracks they have ever done - so on the CD i gave them 4stars cos i love 'world around' and 'resist' from the LP's, but 'mantra' is average really and i havent heard 'purgatory', so id say buy the 2 CD albums or the vinyl EP of this if u r lucky enuff to find it....."
5,Poignant love story,"In the poignant love story of Lucy and Barkley Cooper, when Barkley loses their home to the bank, Lucy and Barkley must go live with their children. Lucy goes to live with their son in the city and Barkley with a daughter in the country, 300 miles apart. When their children are unable or unwilling to assist them in living together, the two have one last day in the city, visiting the spots of their honeymoon fifty years before."
4,a sad film about the Depression,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Make Way for Tomorrow is about an elderly couple who moves in with their children after losing their house. The film is well known for being a tearjerker and Orson Welles reportedly said that the movie would make a stone cry. I don't want to reveal anymore as I wish to avoid spoilers.The DVD supplements are interviews with Peter Bogdanovich and Gary Giddins who discuss the film and its director, Leo McCarey.This is a film relevant to today's tough economic times and serves as a reminder of what can happen when the economy slumps. I can only assume that the 2008 economic slump prompted Criterion to select this film for release."
2,Make way for depression,"I had to watch two upbeat movies after this one to get the depression out of my system. What a ride down the road of despair! What in the name of Home Entertainment did the other reviewers have in mind when reviewing this epic downer!? ""Beautiful""?! WHAT'S so 'Beautiful' about an elderly couple losing their home and being forced to live separately with relatives who want nothing to do with them!? And talk about overacting - mostly on the part of the mother. This movie lacks more than other viewers neglect to admit.On the positive side, and on a historical level, it does show what audiences in those days were able to stomach."
4,The spirit of the human heart,So sad in many ways but the time this couple spends alone together more than overcomes the separation they face.
4,So Sad,This movie shows how some children cannot be bothered to care(in many different ways) for their parents after the children grow up. The results are tragic. This movie will make you sad and depressed. This is because it rings true. Get this DVD to see a side of the world every decent person wishes did not exist.
4,Another great one!,Hard Hat Harry is a great series of videos. Our son can sit and watch the same ones over and over and doesn't seem to get bored of them. He learns about things that he wouldn't have otherwise known.
1,"Wrist, yes. Talkie, no.","We bought a pair of these thinking they'd be an ideal gift for our 4-year-old nephew. They look great, and the hands-free styling is nice. But it's a good thing we tested them before wrapping the gift. They work terribly. We got very flaky reception with a lot of background noise, and we were less than 40 feet apart. They are promptly being returned."
1,No difference,"After several weeks, I don't see any improvement in my dog's itching. Won't buy again."
4,Worked like a charm!,"We have a mixed breed of Doxy and Beagle. Stepping on his short hair was like stepping on sharp pine needles. Not only did this product cut down on the amount of shedding, but our dog's coat has never felt softer. And the results were almost immediate."
3,Same old song...,"This is in the same vein as many other wrestling autobiographies. A lot of ""Yes, I did some bad things, but what I did doesn't compare to what the other guy(s) did."" It was nice to hear Shawn's side of things and hear about how he came up in the business. But I'm so tired of reading these wrestling books where everyone wants to shift blame to the next person. No one stands up and says they were the bad guy. I thought it was funny how every idea Shawn came up with that would be ""good for the business"" happened to have him in the top feuds and as the world champion. And I've heard that the story about the Undertaker making sure he dropped the belt to Stone Cold is true, despite what he wants others to believe. A nice read, but more of the same from the wrestling community."
2,Pretty much what I expected...,"I read the majority of the book and I must say it was essentially what I thought HBK would say. Some things I agreed with, while others I didn't which is perfectly fine. The book itself provided insights about his career, and his personal life. However, some things he said I took issue with. Granted some may agree with his opinions on Shane Douglas, Bret Hart, and his justifications on ""losing his smile"", but looking back on all conflicting facts it's somewhat hard to believe his sincerity. If you are an HBK fan, or buying for an HBK fan, this book is perfect for you. However, if you have to choose an xmas gift between this book and the new Bret Hart DVD that was released on the same day, go with the DVD."
4,The Book Fits the Image,"Shawn Michaels has fun in the ring pretending to be a pain in the rear SOB. To do it so believably, at least some of that has to come from within. That same 'I'm a tough guy superstar' moxie comes through in the book. Michaels is a guy who has put in the work to become one of the top superstars in sports entertainment and the book Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story reads that way. Michaels is cocky, yet at times humble. While wrestling fans will definitely enjoy getting Michael's version of the truth on various rumors that his name has swirled around in, the true - can't put it down part comes through his search for a family and a relationship with God."
5,Great Book,"Thsi is a great book and Shawn takes us through his mountain tops and his journey through the valley. A great, informative and entertaining read."
4,Heartbreak Kid comes through again!,"I just finished reading ""The Shawn Michaels Story"" and I must admit, I was surprised. This book actually shows a reflection of the real man and not the egotist that he portrays on television. I actually read this book in two sittings over the course of two days. I found it pretty hard to set down. Good read."
5,Fast Paced Friendly Fun,"This is a great read. It is a reader friendly fast paced page turne. Heartbreak & Triumph is a book that offers great first hand insight into the life of Professional Wrestling's Showstopper. The Kliq, Partying Hall Nash HHH and of course that all to well remembered night in Montreal. I LOVED IT."
1,Heart Break Jerk,"This guy is a jerk and always will be a jerk The people Shawn Michaels screwed over is a long list. He was never a big draw as champion and had a mediocre arsenal of moves. Grant it Michaels was a good punching bag like Ricky Morton of the Rock N Roll Express. But could never carry a match like Hart, Sting, Flair or Steamboat.He blames Bret well hell he made Bret insane with his antics. HHH as well is responsible with his daddy in law Vince for Montreal. I'm glad his body is falling apart. He wants to come across as a so-called Christian. He's like most religous people full of it. He just does to keep his ex-stripper wife around. This guy is pure trash!!!!!!!!"
3,Lack of honesty,"The problem I have is I don't feel there's much honesty. He tweaked his knee prior to Wrestlemania 13(little pain, according to Shawn) and didn't wrestle at Wrestlemania. The following year he had herniated disks(severe pain, according to Shawn) but still wrestled at Wrestlemania. Why would he wrestle at Wrestlemania 14 but not 13? Is it because of the opponents? No explanation is given.Sunny has said she dated Shawn for months. He doesn't acknowledge this, but he doesn't deny it either. Sunny is ignored for the most part. I thought that was strange.I enjoyed the stories(wish there were more though). As a fan I look for honesty with the wrestlers and didn't feel it applies to this book. I still think he's a great wrestler, but could do a better job as an author."
3,"Sick of people bashing HBK,","Listen to all you morons especially the one two reviews under me,stop bashing HBK and his book.He is an good wrestler who has been in the WWE since the late 80's longer than anyone on the current WWE roster.He is a tremendous person w/an great passion for wrestling who has done more for the business from just about anyone.So if you dont like him or his book then fine but stop bashing and putting negative comments under this section."
1,Disgusting bitter old man,"I picked up Shawn Micheals audobiography at a book store and read the introduction at first I thought what Shawn said was really nice a little too nice and what he was saying was honost. Then of course I turned to the only interesting part of his carrer, the montreal screw job and I was disgusted with what he had to say. He claims that he ""Shawn"" and he ""Shawn"" alone thought of the screw-job, that really pissed me off. Secondly what really up set me, was he never expressed any remorse for what he did after all of this time, thirdly he really cuts Bret Hart up and paints Bret Hart off to be some arrogant jerk. I think in reality Shawn is a really bitter old person and I really hope Bret Hart mentions Shawn Micheals audobiorgraphy in his up-coming book and cuts Shawn up"
5,Powerful Testimony,"I have been following Shawn Michaels' career in pro wrestling since I first saw him in AWA as I believe in 1985, I had no idea how he would became in future. I am very impressed with Shawn's honesty involving his personal problem. I read other reviews some react negative abt his book. I dont care, myself am devoted born again Christian, and I understood how Shawn felt because I was in his same shoe with all kind of screw ups in the view of point. I used to love to hate Shawn when he was in WWF (now WWE). I am thankful about how God is very gracious toward Shawn and I can see how God was gracious to me as same he showed to Shawn. I strongly recommend u check out book by Superstar Billy Graham and Eddie Guerrero because they have similarities problem as Shawn Michaels. I consider it one of most powerful testimony for others who are struggling with their Christian life."
2,Could have been way better,It just seemed to me that Shawn Michaels was just saying what he wanted you to hear. It didn't seem like it was an honest portrayal of who he is. The book was also very boring at times. I wasn't impressed. If you want to read about wrestlers read Ric Flair or Bret Harts book. Both were light years better than HBKs.
2,The truth is not always popular?,"The truth is not always popular is the title of one of the chapters in this book...Whose version of the truth, Shawn? Your version of the truth is filled with lies, skipping over facts and burying quality wrestlers...His comments about Bret Hart are absolutely deplorable and Shawn should be ashamed of himself...In the ring he was one of the best ever, but outside the ring he is a disgrace to the wrestling business...Thank goodness there are books from Mick Foley and Bret Hart that are sincere, from the heart and actually honest...This book contains none of those qualities..."
4,Uplifting and enlightening,"I am a huge mark for Shawn Michaels so I bought this book with rose-tinted glasses. I need not have worried that Shawn would come across as unlikeable or too boastful, he came across as a guy who lived his dream to be a great wrestler and made it to the very top before injuries curtailed his career for the better part of four years. He was quite modest in places.Michaels entered a world of painkillers to get over his injuries and was in a bad way before he found God (or God found him) and he saw the light to redemption both personally and professionally.I found the book to be a quick and easy read and I liked it a lot. I wouldn't have minded a few more backstage stories but what was written was pretty good."
5,"If you're a fan of Shawn Michaels, this is a must read!","This book is very descriptive of Shawn's personal life and the life he leads in the WWE, from the time he was a child right up to the present day. When I started reading, I experienced many emotions finding it difficult to put down. It is a must read for all fans of HBK!!"
4,Great phone system,"I like Uniden phone system. We currently have the base and an additional 4 handsets which makes it quite convenient. We have caller id with call waiting, and when you're on the phone and another call comes in, it registers on all the handsets. That's a good thing. I also like the privacy feature on it, where if anyone picks up another handset while you're on the phone with the privacy feature activated, they won't hear the conversation. The only thing I don't like about the phone is the talk time,on the handsets, decreases substantially with frequent use. That's the reason I only gave it four stars instead of five."
1,poor performance,"I tried this system for two days. Several times when I tried to answer a call the handset would say ""Connecting ..."" for 30 seconds or a minute before I could talk on the call. Other times when I was 15 feet across the room from the base station the handset would say ""out of range"". If you push the ""Talk"" button again while the handset is connecting with the base it hangs up the call.Also, you can not use the intercom feature with the speaker, which was annoying."
1,Rebooting Base Problem,"As reported by the other reviewer, the base of my phone reboots every few calls. So people hang up and don't leave messages because it takes too long for the answering machine to pick up. Or it takes an annoying long amount of time to get a dial tone as you wait for the base to reboot. I thought I was getting a good deal on this phone from Costco. Boy was it a mistake!"
1,Do not buy,"If you are looking for a phone that only works 1 of 10 times this is the phone for you. It will go into a mode of saying ""Answering"" and it is definitely isn't answering. You must unplug and disconnect the phone line from the jack to reset it. Also, when you try to make an outgoing call it says ""Connecting"" and maybe two minutes later you will get a dial tone. DO NOT BUY this phone, I plan to return it......."
1,19 minute battery life no matter what,My handset is placed back on the charger every time I'm not on the phone and still it only has a 19 minute battery life for a call. This is the second battery that this phone has had and I don't plan on buying another one for it. Stay away at all costs!
1,Terrible,"The worst Christian movie I've seen. Ill-conceived, silly premise, poorly paced, etc. etc.Over half the movie is stupid training shots - climbing walls, jogging, etc. One plot twist is completely implausible (involving contents of cargo). A ragtag bunch of kids takes on Hezbollah? Please.This is an embarrassment to all Christian movie-makers anywhere. To those who gave it good reviews - you are doing everyone a grave disservice. If you really enjoyed it, OK, otherwise, I'd consider it deceitful."
1,To Long,"I waited awhile to see this film and at the price I thought I'll get it. Then I was disappointed in the film. The story line was great a group of Christians that specialize in helping persucuted Christians and bringing needed aid. But the acting was very flat and unemotional. There was to many characters that you can't get attached to. Not enogh time on the charcters to get to know them. They seemed to be just there. The gospel message was not really there either. The training scenes were way to long, they covered almost half of the film and tried to be a b rate music video. As another christian film maker I was diappoined greatly. Give it was a lower budget, but I have worked with 0 budget films and they came out more entertaining."
2,From the Penthouse to the outhouse,"Despite the fact that this DVD was released in 2001, the credits indicate that the footage was shot in 1994. It features about eight different models in very tame scenarios. This is nowhere near the explicit fare you would expect from Penthouse. Penthouse does this from time to time (repackages old footage and sticks their name on it). It's kind of deceptive and doesn't do justice to their reputation for generally offering a quality product. This DVD should come with a warning to Penthouse fans - ""Beware, no pink""."
2,Accidentally voted for it,"While browsing for a case for my new Ipod, Amazon asked me to vote on which of two cases I liked best. I clicked on this one to learn more about it, but that was read as a vote. Oops. Be careful when you look at their polls.In reading of similar products, many, many people complain about clear plastic covers scratching. However, they also complain about thicker covers being hard to handle. I would probably cut out the offending part with a razor blade, and buy the adhesive clear cover to attach directly to the Ipod in its place. This would also protect the Ipod when being pulled in and out. However, this case has a bigger plastic piece and probaby couldn't be done this way.I think a side-opening cover is inconvenient.I've seen a clear acrylic hard case after use. It is a terribly scratched up item.Remember that you may have to remove your Ipod from its case to use a dock like Ihome, etc. This action can scratch the Ipod. Many people have written this sad news."
1,It is horrible,"When I got this item Today, I thought it was a good product. When I went to go put it on it all ready had been scratched! The case I bought 1 Hour ago was scratched and was impossible to get off. When I finally got it off, the dust on the inside of the case had scratched my Ipod Video. It was even worse scratched than before.Do not buy this product it scratch's your ipod."
5,A Beautiful Story of Struggle and Independence,"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I had to read it for a class in college, and I will be the first to admit that I was turned off by the cover and the bland title. I'm glad I was forced to give this book a chance. It's an amazing true story of a female doctor in Cairo who is taken away to a prison for her outspoken ideas. The governemnt takes her from her home and forces her to live with several other women with very differnt backgrounds from one another. However, the situation causes Sadaawi to become somewhat of a ""leader,"" and the women form a strong and unique friendship. It's an amazing and beautiful book and also a fast read - don't pass this up."
5,satisfied customer,"I got the book sooner than I expected, and it was in great condition. I was very satisfied with this purchase."
1,Disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Although I like Sadawi's fiesty, rebellious spirit, I must say that I was HIGHLY disappointed in her work! I rarely come across a book that I don't finish and to tell you the truth, she made me return the book. Her bland and simplistic writing style didn't go well with me. At times, this book even put me to sleep. Anyway, the real significant drawback of this book is that it is written in an extremely narraw perspective! The whole book is about her and her memoirs, you don't even know what the other person is thinking. Hence, if you ask me I would say: SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH!!!"
1,"It works, no it doesn't, it works, no it doesn't........","Like other reviewers I needed a card reader in a hurry, so I bought this POS from a big box store. This reader is JUNK. I repeat, this reader is JUNK. Do not waste your money.Like the title says, it works for short periods (few seconds) then it quits, then starts the process all over again. If you are really unlucky, it may quit, then start up again and REFORMAT the media you have installed, thereby losing all the photos you just took of your family reunion. Don't ask me how I know this. Anyway, to keep your sanity intact, go buy something else, not this junk."
1,Look Elsewhere,"I picked this up because it states on the packaging that it works with Windoze Vista. It didn't matter what I tried, nothing, NOTHING worked. Support for this thing under any OS but Win98 is nonexistent. The packaging also claims to not need any drivers for Vista. Wrong again. It needs something because it wouldn't even be detected half the time. If you've got Vista, move on, this product isn't for you (or me). If I could give it zero stars, I would."
1,Horrible,"This is a horrible card reader. It physically damages the cards (both XD and SD). I just lost half my pictures from Egypt. Good job Targus. SPEND THE MONEY TO BUY SOMETHING BETTER!(I would have done a video review, but (1) there would have been a lot of swearing and (2) I couldn't get it off my camera anyway.)"
1,This thing sucks !,"I bought one of these at walmart cause they are cheap. But when I got it home and plugged it in I noticed my memory cards getting hot, and then I could smell hot plastic. What happened was that it fried my cards, being a photographer I dont need stupid stuff like that happening. I would recommend putting some good money into a card reader."
1,Cheap and destructive,"I got this from a big chain store with high hopes.I can't find anything positive to say about it, oh maybe it doesn't require any installation.it is cheaply made, takes FOREVER to transfer pictures/data, and the icing on the cake, it left a crack in my SDHC memory card. I wish I could get a refund for my memory card. Now i have to find a way to get the data off the cracked memory card - sure not worth the price of this cheap crap.Save the money for something better. Lexar and SanDisk have better products. In my ploy to save money, I'm going to spend more because of this wonderfully crappy reader."
2,meh,"First off, it appears they're built by ""Merkury"" FOR Targus. [...] the support link goes to [...]That page isn't working for me today. :-<Had my work buy one of these for camera cards, used it for SD and XD camera cards just fine.Bought another at home- works ok with SD cards but it won't read the Compact Flash cards from a CISCO Router (formatted with FAT32). Says I need to format the card first. Tried with a laptop running Win7 and a desktop running Vista.[[[[NO, it's NOT the cards, my 2yr old Acer Desktop (Vista) with built-in card reader can access them just fine.]]]]I'm horribly disappointed, that's the main reason I bought another one."
5,Cheap and works great with many card types.,Buying this is a no brainer if you have multiple card formats that you want to input into your computer or write to.
2,"Decent, but Disappointing","This piece of hardware is nice and small. It would be good if you didn't have to keep up with a cord in addition to the unit, but the only other option is having a big wart on the side of your laptop.As a card reader this one is decent, however, I regret buying it and feel mislead by the marketing on the packaging. I bought this unit because of it's claim to support micro-SD cards; however, it doesn't seem to support them directly, but instead through a separate mini-SD to SD adapter. The whole reason that I got this was because I didn't want to have to deal with the adapter... grr."
3,Its Not Reggae,"Disappointed. If you, like me, were expecting a Reggae sound, you,like me, will be highly disappointed. That doesn't say that songs like Dragonfly and Rainbow are not good. They are okay...but not what one expects from the son of a Reggae icon like Bob. If this is where Ziggy's music is going... I say get the Melody Makers back and start to produce some real Reggae. Just don't give us anymore of this. Its not Reggae and its not what Reggae lovers want to hear."
2,"Solid, typical Ziggy, but OK at best.","Ziggy said that this album would surprise a lot of people. Perhaps, but not those who heard ""Spirit of Music.""It's a natural progression from ""Spirit"" to ""Dragonfly."" It was obvious that Ziggy would make a folksy/rock album with reggae flavor. But the one thing that holds this album down is that this style/sound has been done before by others and with more passion and originality. ""Dragonfly"" isn't much different than what you heard on ""Spirit of Music,"" and, unfortunately, it doesn't better what was there.It's an OK, mellow, solid listen, but just not better than what ZM & MM fans will likely already have in their collections.It's a pleasant enough solo excursion, but this ZM & MM fan is still waiting for the group to release a version of ""Uncle Sam,"" which it was playing while it was last on tour.""Dragonfly"" is for hardcore ZM & MM fans only."
5,BEAUTIFUL...BUY!!!!!,"I bought this album about a month ago. I love these songs. Ziggy Marley is a beautiful person mind, body, & soul. This album all of the songs are postive messages about peace, love, and truth. My favorite songs are True To Myself, I Get Out, & In The Name Of God. I relate the most to these, but the whole album is tight (good). all I can say is buy it. it's more then well worth it. also if you can see him in concert it's a unforgetable experince. Most likly the best show you will ever have see, and for right now the best album you will buy."
4,Not What You Probably Will Expect - But Good Nonetheless,"If you're looking for classic Ziggy Marley, then you might want to re-consider buying this album. However, if you're willing to try something a little different, then this new album by Ziggy probably won't dissapoint you. It's definitely not what I was expecting. However, once I got over the fact that it isn't a hard-core Reggae album, I really enjoyed it. It's a new, refreshing sound from Ziggy."
2,Far too many errors,"All I can say about this book is: buyer beware! Don't take Mr. Harry's word for it, make sure you doublecheck everything you read. This book suffers from the same annoying errors as his ""Beatles Encyclodepia"", that is, there are way too many of them, some of them so superficial that you'd think he did no research at all (i.e. Dennis Wilson date of death is off by two years). Almost everytime I pick up this book, I find another error. Mr. Harry, feel free to send me a draft of the next edition to review for you. Free!"
2,Poorly attempted write-up of interesting subjects.,"Bill Harry had a good start with the concept of a Who's Who of musical history, but lost it terribly when noticing the constant mistakes, misspellings, and misinformation. Just when you get into learning some tidbits of info, he loses you when the reader has to fill in blanks and correct information. A good idea, but get your facts straight."
2,Leg Offense,"This DVD is not so good. The coach, Rob Knoll, even says on the DVD that he can get a 4 time state champion come to his wrestling program and does great for him, and he gets the credit. This DVD only has one or two techniques and he spends 40 mins. doing it. Not such a good DVD. Would not recommend."
5,The Enemy Within,I am very happy that I ordered this online. The condition was actually exactly what I wanted it to be.
5,Sound doctrine simply stated,"This is a great book for a group study or self-study if the group is an honest, safe group of people. The questions at the end of each well-written chapter don't ask you to regurgitate the text but instead to dig a little and apply the information to your own life. It has helped me correct course a tiny bit each week."
5,Easy read about a difficult subject,"This is a fantastic book that is easy to read, but not a trivial read. Kris Lundgaard has put a difficult subject to understand and tackle in a language that we the church can use day to day. He has done the hard sledding of transcribing the crib notes from the toms that are Jonathan Owen's work. This book is written for folks like me who are not the most disciplined of readers and want the bottom line up front. He does not shorten the message, but sets the material up for a page turning read. This is a valuable teaching tool for Youth leaders, campus ministers, adult sunday school teachers, etc. looking for a practical book regarding a challenging topic in the life of believers. I recommend this book to all walks of...walkers in the faith.Please pray for Kris and Paula as they minister on a foreign field with their boys living the gospel of Grace daily."
5,Mass-production Owen,"Kris Lundgaard brings the masterful works of John Owen down to earth for the rest of us. If you have ever wanted to read the Puritans but were intimidated, this book is a superb place to start. The writing is clear, the chapters are short, the examples are understandable--but the theology is all Owen.Lundgaard/Owen explain how sin works in our lives and what must be done to kill it. When I first read the descriptions of how sins works, I said to myself, ""Yes! That's exactly what's going on inside me."" Many pastors--even good pastors--shy away from preaching on this subject because it doesn't feel good. In fact, it feels awful. But Christians must take a good look at their indwelling sin if they have any hope of killing it.I first read this book in a small group book study. It worked really well in that format, but would also work well in personal study.I personally find reading pure Owen extremely difficult. I wish Lundgaard or others would re-write more of Owen's works."
3,Author grounds everything on a Regenerate View of Romans 7:14-24,"This review is for anyone who has studied the various view points on who is the ""I"" in Romans 7:14-24.If you happen to hold the unregenerate view on Romans 7 (Pious Jew; Adamic Humanity; etc). It would be helpful for you to know that the author grounds the thrust of this book on a regenerate view of Romans 7:14-24 viewing the ""I"" as a regenerate Believer (Either the Mature Christian, Struggling Christian, or Paul himself; etc.) who battles with indwelling sin.Regardless of your view on the ""I"" in Romans 7, this book is EXCELLENT and it deals with the believer's continual battle with sin. The author bring us the work of John Owen in a readable and applicable manner. If you don't hate your sin, pick up this book and hopefully it will help you in your continual pursuit of sanctification.I would also highly recommend Thomas Watson's ""The Doctrine of Repentance"" and ""The Mischief of Sin""."
3,Great grill for the money with one major flaw - Rainwater,"I have had this grill for a few months now. Overall features and performance is great for the money. I see two problems with the grill. First is temperature. Even with the burners on low the grill is very hot. It takes a little getting use to but with 4 burners I find I can typically turn 1 or 2 off and cook many things in a indirect mode that actually works better and keeps the meats from drying out or getting crispy on the outside. The other problem is much more bothersome. The back of the bottom cabinet is open just under the grill box. This allows rainwater that falls on the grill to run down the back, across the bottom and drop off into the grease catch pan. It fills the pan with any decent storm so now the grease that was in the pan is all over the bottom cabinet and your deck. Until Ducane can fix this issue, I would only recommend the grill if you use a cover or store the grill under something."
3,For the beginer,"Having been in the web industry for some time, I thought I'd purchase this book to possibly increase my design skills.Apart from the samples at the back, this book came across as very basic to me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has experience in this area, rather, those who are looking to get into web developement/design."
5,All website designers need this book!,"I really valued gr-animals when my kids were small. They always matched. As a website designer, I NEED to match colors and make them flow. With this book, it was easy to see how colors go togethere and create professional looking websites."
1,Where are the Chararcters?,"One dimensional characters, chatting away in contemporary cynical Nort-American Humor. What is the point of this book?Too bad I can't give it zero stars."
3,Sorry everyone who loves it...,"I don't understand how everyone seems to LOVE these books. Maybe I'm just impatient, maybe I just don't like Eddings, but his books seem to drag on forever! I know that they're supposed to be great, but I don't understand it. Couldn't he get to the chase? Add some excitement! For those who are impatient like me, these books are not for you! Go ahead, try the first one, but if you start losing interest, be warned that it doesn't get any better!"
2,Boring and too long,Why is it that Eddings seems to feel that no book is complete without half of it being taken up with pointless boring dialogue? Cutting out this would half the length of the series but I suppose it would also half Edding's royalties.The plots were unrealistic and predictable. The characters were one dimensional. The themes were little more than Eddings making sweeping generalisations and assuptions about life. I was reminded at times of Walt Disney films where a good story takes second place to predictable politically correct ideas. Do not read this - it is an awful book by an awful author.
2,Not worth your time,"Picked this up based on Amazon.com reviews, thinking that he was a proficient writer of high fantasy. By page 25 I realized that the writer is unable to realistically portray any type of interpersonal relationship or engaging character. I only made it through the first third of the book - it was all I could force myself to get though. I ended up getting so frustrated with the book that I left it on the Subway hoping a bum could put it to better use by using it to fuel a fire. What I was able to make it through was scattered and lacked direction. The characters are cliche and lack any emotional depth. Worst of all the book reads on what must be a 7th grade level - which is great if you are in 7th grade - but last I checked this wasn't a Young Readers book.If you are looking for high quality epic fantasy, look elsewhere and save your cash."
2,Tedious repetition,"A very very tedious repetition of the Belegariad at double the length and half the wit. The Belegariad was interesting because you met the characters for the first time, and the flatness of the characterization didnt become that apparent. These books dont have that redeeming factor. Just page after paiful page of unnatural and stiff dialog, contrived situations and impossible twists."
5,wonderfully written!!!,"i picked this book up and was at once taken to a different place, with sorcery and prophecy. i love the way Ce'Nedra, Polgara, and Liselle can deflate any of the men's egos at any given time! i liked this book so much that i went out and bought the rest of the series, and have read the Mallorean at least three times by now...and i still find it to be good reading. highly recommended!"
5,Excellent follow-up to the Belgriad series!,"The book expands on the adventures of Garion, Silk, Polgara, et al. As is Edding's usual style, the book is well written and extremely readable.It picks up the tale, immediately after Garion's wedding and begins another 5 book set into Eddings' fantasy world.Highly recommended."
2,Strictly Diet Fantasy,"As a Tad Williams fan who appreciates a realistic 80% mortality rate among the heroes, formidable villains, dense plotting and haunting settings, Eddings 'Mallorean' reads like a happy romp through a schoolyard on a spring day. Eddings' narrative devotes multiple pages to building up various baddies, who are then dispatched in the space of one when encountered by omnipotent heroes. Very shortly anything the villains say sounds trite and inconsequential, however threatening. The entire series should have 'Suspense Free!' stamped on it."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"PLEASE don't waste your money on this book. It is SO boring that I put it down halfway through. Unless you like a book that puts you to sleep in the middle of day. So, please, turn off your computer and go outside and play. NEVER TOUCH THIS BOOK! By the way, is it possible to give it zero stars? Now, go read a Tolkein book because they are really good."
1,Utter Drivel,"I started to read this crap, and halfway through, I couldn't pick it back up. This whole business with Garion and Ce'Nedra fighting at the beginning caused me to lose my lunch on several occasions. It wasn't a total loss, I lost five pounds. Then again, I regained 10 after giving up in frustration and eating the book. Here's a tip: Take 'Guardians of the West' and simmer it until the pages brown. Douse heavily with BBQ sauce. Place between two halves of a bun. Voila, you've just made an Eddings burger. Eating the books is way more intelligent than actually reading them, after all."
1,Dissapointed,"This book had a lot of good reviews, so I was suprised that I couldn't get past about page 30. I tried to read the other series with the same characters, and couldn't get into it either. The characters are utterly stereotypical and forgetable, and I didn't care what happened to any of them. I have only not finished about 5 books ever (and I read at least one thick fantasy or sci-fi book a week), and this author scored 2 out of the 5. Skip this one."
1,"Sensless, repeditive vomit.","This book was the greatest... if you're having problems falling asleep. Same ol', same ol'. Nothing changes. No one dies, exept some loser who never says or does anything. And the characters are all above any sort of temptation. They have no desires people!!! You know, it would be kinda entertaining if Eddings added something new to his novels... A TWIST? The baddies are so dumb it's sad. The good guys come, stomp some guys, come to some retarded cave and some blind person has a choice between lite and dark... GUESS WHO WINS?It may be entertaining if Eddings wrote a book like Invasion, where characters arn't afraid to go over to evil. In fact it happens reguarly.However, asking for anything more would be asking Eddings to get four times better in writing skill. He has no new ideas in any of his books EVER."
1,A total insult to The Belgariad,"""Gaurdians of the West"" is just the beginningof another ""OH GOSH WHAT AN ORIGINAL PLOT A CHILD DISCOVERS HIDDEN POWERS ANDMUST FULFIL AN ANCIENT PROPHECY TO DEFEAT AND ANCIENT EVIL ANDSAVE THE WORLD OH WOW OH MY I THINK I'LL GO AND STICK MY HEAD IN ACUPBOARD"" series! Its a pile of sh*t!"
1,somebody please put a bullet in this,"Please Mr. Eddings, toss that typewriter out of the window...your childish musings are annoying at best, and a great blemish on the genre at worst. Cookie cutter plots, characters, and situations populate this book, and every other that follows it.This book deserves little more than a good roasting on a spit...it's that bad."
3,Unnecessary,"This book is completely unnecessary. After you've read it, pick up the second book and read the short summary of the first book found therein. Notice how it covers absolutely everything of interest in the first book. Ponder how 500 pages can be distilled into 5 pages without leaving anything out. Conclude that, in the first book, nothing much really happened.I'm not saying you won't enjoy this book. It's a quick read and perfectly pleasant. If you liked his previous books you'll probably like this one. It's just that the book is 5 pages of plot and 495 pages of filler. That's the price you pay for having a short novel expanded to 5 volumes."
2,"omgoodness, this is crap","I love the fantasy in these books and a few of the side characters but I'm about to put it down simply because the main characters are so terribly written.SPOILERS. So first someone tries to kill ce'nedra, then someone tries to maker her kill her baby, then someone kills brand, and none of these things caused them to worry enough to leave a guard on ce'nedra when the men leave to fight their war. So when someone steals you kid, I. Just. Don't. Care.Buy this if you liked the Belgariad and want to know what happens to Silk and Mandorallen. There are whole chapters you can skip that do nothing but characterize Garion as a whipped, whiny brat.Oh and the premise: The last prophecy was only a prelude, there's another prophecy that only matters if the first prophecy was fulfilled.Poorly written. Poorly edited. But it's got enough to it that I'll probably finish it. It would be a great starter fantasy though. Someday I'll give it to my kids."
5,20 stars,A great book eddings has made a new standed in fantasy novel this book was so deep and involving I could read it a million times. A great master peice.
3,Average,"I agree with another reviewer above that Eddings is hardly an 'A' list author. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the series, especially the Belgariad, but my criticisms are listed below.The dialogue in his books is terrible, why does everybody have to say 'dear' in just about sentence, and why are the characters all the same?Why does belgarath always say ""One of these days I must sit down and have a long chat with . . . .""Why do they only appear to be able to use sorcery in certain situations, (for instance ""that doesn't work on Grolims"" from Demon lord of Karanda) Why not?"
4,A good read,"I'll come right out and admit it: when I picked up the Mallorean, I'd never even heard of the Belgariad. In my opinion, that's one of the things that makes this series such a great reading experiance. Throughout the whole saga, I was easily able to keep up with the whole plot (even though I didn't really know that much about big characters like Azash and such). Eddings has a fairly predictable story line, but nevertheless, it's very good. Instead of getting too deep into things like theology and magic, Eddings instead focuses upon the adventure itself, and plenty of comic relief for the whole Zandramas incident. Some of my favorite characters were Prince Kheldar, aka Silk and Ce'Nedra. The tale is more fun than anything, and definately worth trying out."
4,Its alright...,"This review goes for all the Mallorean books. David Edding is a talented writer, no question about that. He can make appealing characters, and I like the humour that surrounds them: That's what making the book enjoyable. That's why I give it 4 stars But he certainly isn't way original, the plot to this books is, actually, kind of bad. The heroes have powers like gods and you never really fear for there lives. And when you read it, you never really get surprised. Maybe its more like a three star book... But I do understand why it is so popular."
3,"Not a bad outing, but not what you'd think","I was hoping for a bit more jazz sound, with the personnel included. Surprisingly, it's much more of a groove record. At times, some of the tunes reminded me of some instrumental parts from later Steely Dan albums.It's done well, but it wasn't what I was looking for. If you are a Bill Frisell fan and are considering this, there are only a couple of tracks that are really worth pursuing."
3,"Fun, but broke easily","I bought 2 of these for my twin boys and both toys broke within a month, they just stopped making any noise when the boys blew in to them. They loved playing with these while they lasted."
3,"Good in Theory, but...","the drum hardly makes any noise at all -- and the drumsticks (while safe) are attached, so my son had a hard time stretching them over to beat on the drum. The whistle is a little hard to blow, too. A great idea that kind of lost it when they made this product."
1,Hopelessly obsolete! Don't waste your money.,"This may have been okay in its day, but calls for materials no longer being made (e.g., Royal Egg Sheen), and ignores those available today. There are many excellent books for stark beginners, as well as wonderful mailing lists (see YahooGroups.com). Don't waste your money on this garbage."
4,A Recent History of the Promised Land,"This is a throughly enjoyable book -- a fictional history of Israel covering the period between the late 1800's and the Balfore Declaration. Gloria Goldreich manages to turn a lot of 'history' into a very charming and readable story of a family as they settle the land that will eventually become the State of Israel. The characters are fascinating and well drawn. Their relationships with their Arab neighbors and the Turkish authorities interesting and accurately rendered. A vast amount of Jewish history has been packaged in this small, delightful book."
4,excited to find these,these pot hooks will go well with new pot rack. didn't know where i would find something in color i wanted for this and here they are. liked the price too.
4,gentler than another popular shedding tool for my long hair cat. think he'll like this,I tried to use a very popular and expensive shedder on our long hair cat but he really doesn't like it. Also I think the other one loosens too much hair that it doesn't pick up and has sharp edges. The Safari comb is quite gentle yet combs out quite a lot of hair quickly. The cat didn't seem to mind so much - which is good. I've never been able to groom him sufficiently and lately he is having hair ball problems. I hope I can comb him daily now without having to clamp him to the floor. Today was the first day of use and his coat looks and feels much better. Comb seems pretty durable and well built. I held back on the 5th star until I have a sense of durability. The rounded comb tips are very nice.
2,Cat Pleasure,My cat does not like this product as it pulls knots out and apparently hurts the cat. Would not recommend this product it cat has long hair subject to tangling.
5,Great product,"This is the perfect comb for my cat. She is a RagaMuffin and has very long silky fur which sheds. Also, when she grooms herself she ingests some fur and chokes. This comb removes lots and lots of loose fur, and most important, she really enjoys her grooming sessions."
2,Not good for short hair cats.,"Both of my cats are domestic short hairs, and this comb seems to be designed for much longer hair breads, which is not what it says in the description. I am rarely able to collect any of their loose hair with this."
3,Cat Shedding Comb,"I gave this comb to my cat, but she refuses to use it. Humor aside, this is a nice comb for the cat as long as your cat doesn't have really super fine hair. On my cats, it basicly acts as a comb to get their hair in place. As far as removing all the loose shedding hair, I've been unimpressed. I don't know how well it will work to get knots or tangles out since none of my cats have really long hair, and they're all indoor cats. I did find that this works well on my dogs, who have much coarser hair, so since I've discovered a practical use for it, I'll keep it."
5,Fantastic Comb!,I bought this for my medium hair kitten (8 months). The other brushes hurt her or didn't do anything for her.She loves it! She purrs the entire time. All the stray hair that comes off your hand when you pet her is gone.I highly recommend this comb. Just don't buy it expecting MASSIVE amounts of fur like the shed ender or the furminator. This comb gets all the loose hair off and removes matted fur.
4,Removes Masses of Hair Quickly,"This brush is great for the price, it removes bushels of hair from my two long-haired cats. It tugs a little bit in thick spots, but just like human hair, with a gentle touch, the comb goes through easily and smoothly. One of my cats can't get enough brushing, she loves it, but the other dislikes it because of the occasional pulling sensation it causes on his underfur. It does remove a lot of hair in just a minute of brushing, which is sometimes all you one can get their cat to withstand! If your cat dislikes brushing anyway, stay away from this one, but otherwise this tool is pretty effective when it's used."
3,Good casual bra for C cups and under.,"It's a good bra for medium to smaller cups. I'm a D cup, so I was stuffed in it....not very attractive at all. I know, I should have known better! I wanted this type of bra for summer tops that have spaghetti straps. It didn't work well for me, but if you are a smaller cup, I think it will be fine for casual wear. The fabric was smooth and comfortable. The stretch is minimal.Actually, if you are a A to a small B cup, and not interested in any type of padding, this would make a nice everyday bra. For full B to C cups, it's probably better suited for casual wear."
2,Doesn't stretch much and slips,"It runs a little small and doesn't stretch very much. This means that while it fits me ok, it slips and isn't very nice looking. The matierial looks like it will take a lot of wear."
1,Spandex,This product runs small and is rather constricting - not what I as looking for. It was not as stretchy as I had expected. I was interested in finding a knit tube top like the ones from the 70's.
3,A tad disappointed,"It's good quality, no doubt about that, but the slits in the holster barely, and I mean barely fit a 1-3/4"" garrison belt through them. Perhaps over time it will get easier, or maybe applying some silicone will make it easier, but it is a project getting the belt to slide through, and then once it's through, to look nice. The belt , because it takes so much to get it through the holster's slits, doesn't pull tight to your body. Probably just needs breaking in."
4,Great introduction and a great buy.,"Has it been a while since your last uP project? Get this book. Easy to read with lots of good examples. I/O, timers, UART, I2C and etc. Covers mostly the 90S1200 and Tiny parts. Morton points out where and what the differences are for other parts. Only problem I see is the organization. It can be difficult to find a particular section when using it as a reference. Reads more like a book than a reference which some may say is a good thing."
3,Decent Start,"This book provides a decent start to AVR programming, but it doesn't include any C, which I think would be a nice addition.In any event, the book is certainly packed with information, although it is a little light on explanatory material regarding the general electronics.It provides a cook book of projects, has enough information to get you started, and definitely acquaints you with the inner workings of the AVR. With this book, an STK500, and a few AVRs you can build interesting projects. Add a little electronics experience and you'll be on top of things."
2,full of errors,"spent a lot of time checking the credibility of the code, asseemed to be lots of questionable statements. also he doesn't bother explaining the internal pullup resistors and lots of other stuff that a new-to-AVR person wouldn't know. but of course he explains the different numbering systems.not very happy with it."
4,Great book for the beginner!,I knew nothing about the AVR when I bought this book. I just picked some books to start learning and WOW! It got me up to speed so that now I can program an AVR by myself. The only think I would have liked to see was more explaination of each of the codes used. But you can't get everything in one book.
4,good i like it.,"I've never been to their concert because of no chance, so i bought it. I really enjoyed it like being there."
4,Cute Baskets!,"I really like these baskets. The liner is made of a flimsy material, but I have not had any problems. When you put the liner in, you can't pull it down too far over the sides or else it won't fit and will seem like it is stretched to the seams. I got the sage liners and they match my nursery perfectly ( Sienna Patch)."
2,Nice but not to be put in reach of kids,"The baskets are very nice and look great. However, I've given mine away since my crawling girl can now pull little shards of wicker off of them in chokable pieces.They look great as decorative pieces placed out of her reach, but I had wanted to use them at ground level to hold her toys, etc. Just know that once your kid starts zooming around and chewing everything these are not safe."
1,Garbage In - Garbage Out,"This book proves the old computing adage! It's too bad the author doesn't have any solid research to back up the wild claims she makes about Gershwin's life. Too bad there isn't less than one star on amazon.com ratings, this book deserves far less."
2,Confused & Confusing,"A unhealty stew of a book. While there are a few interesting insights, it is poorly integrated with little or no logical development. It reads like a poorly edited Master's thesis. Too much gossip, second and third-hand reports, and gross speculation. Gerwhwin's impact on both popular and ""serious"" music is severely understated. Probably the best part of the book is the picture section."
2,Pentax 10x25 62212 Binocs,"Beware: Though these binocs are not bad optically for what they cost, they are fragile. My pair lost barrel alignment after only a few months of use. They were not dropped or handled rough. Pentax charges $20 to repair under warranty and you pay the shipping to them. That's more than a third the cost of the binocs. There's something wrong with that picture."
4,Great new talent,"I loved reading about the quirky, yet funny characters in this novel. I identified with Nolan's search for meaning in an ordinary life without guideposts, like his father's war, to lend him meaning. We all want to feel special and feel that we are doing something worthwhile and we want to be happy and loved. I rooted for Nolan to ""get it together"" and find his happiness. The writing style is fresh and I laughed out loud at some of the people in Nolan's little town, (especially the parts about ""Fred""). I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes humor with great characters and a fresh outlook on ordinary humans who struggle to find their own war memorials."
2,"Amusing, at its best","...but at its worst the ""novel"" (a little too flimsy to call it that, to be honest) falls apart around a plot so loosely and poorly conceived that it almost becomes difficult to follow. Which is hard to believe, since the conceit of the plot isn't all that ambitious to begin with. I'd have to say this is truly not worth the time, certainly not the price."
4,Work great on four speaker system,"This would have got 5 stars had the terminals not been so small. I realize space in a wall box is tight, but I had a very hard time gettnig tight connections to the wires (they would fall off as I was putting the controller into the wall), since an eyeglass screw driver was the only thing small enough to turn them. Other than that these are great. No disortion, good quality sound. Pheonix, please consider changing those connectors to allen heads, or something else you can tighten."
4,An Improvement over other Sprout Jars,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N8FHH0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI like the large size, as the sprouts were bursting out of the smaller jars. The top is also good, in that it is not a metal material that can rust. I would have, however, preferred it to have come with different lids, containing various choice sizes of strainer holes. Also, a narrower size glass container would be easier to grasp with one hand, unless, ofcourse, it could come with a handle."
2,jar cracked,I only used this jar 2-3 times when it developed a huge crack near the base. American glass isn't what it used to be!
1,Incredibly Poor Production!,"Hey Ags - don't waste your money on this clunker! I would have given it zero stars but I wasn't sure if the review would have registered. This DVD is an absolute joke. The footage quality is terrible and the entire audio is someone reading about what skills a NFL scout is looking for. The audio about Reggie McNeal is all about the size and skills needed for an NFL wide receiver. Every now and then there is cow sound. Perhaps confused with the Longhorns? There are no highlights framed by the moment such as a big win over a rival, a bowl game, or conference championship game. There have been a few moments (not many, but some)in the last 15 years for the Aggies. You won't find them here. If you read the few reviews for this DVD series for other schools you'll see similar comments. It is just pathetic. Not worth $5 let alone $25."
4,memories for the illusionist,"Boston 1828, Eugene O'Neill's play of a proud Irishman, of former nobility, living in his memories the way living was in merry old Europe in years long past. Fritz Weaver(Cornelius Melody) strong willed refuses to allow his wife & daughter to live in the here and now. His independent daughter encounters many verbal skirmishes with Daddy in her attempts to bring him out of his never,never memory lane mind set, without success, while his wife, (Nancy Marchand) condescends to almost a subservient wifely roll, acceding to his every wish and whim, his loyal defender to the end.. When he's off to settle a feud with an opponent by dueling.The plan goes South, no one's injured, and the pround man returns happy with is pride intact. INteresting story and excellent acting. Not quite up to the ""Iceman Cometh"" nor ""Long days Journey into Night"", but a film worth viewing and holding."
3,a shocking expirience,"As I put thye battary in it, it shocked me. But, since I work in a computer store, I replaced the mouse by my husband's computer. Since I enjoy practical jokes, I cracked up laughing watching the expression on his face."
2,not much protection,"Not much protection, I guess you have to go to the quilted ones to expect anything of interest. Anyway, it will cary something so I'll keep it."
2,Disappointed that this wasn't metal,I was disappointed to find that the material used to make this bushing IS PLASTIC NOT METAL as It looked to me in the picture.
3,not up to 1/0 gauge,excepts only up to 4 gauge i have not need at this time for that i was looking for a 0 gauge firewall grommet.
3,Sequencing problem with songs on CD,"I remember seeing this tour in Philadelphia and it rocked super hard. Love Bowie and how creative he can be. The staging for this Glass Spider tour was his best ever. Love the music and visuals but I'm very disappointed that the sequence and labeling of some songs on the CDs are wrong. When I loaded the CDs into my iTunes library songs are mis-labeled so the first version of ""Hereos"" is something else. You'd think with how cutting edge Bowie is he'd let the production of this package go out in such bad shape. Anybody else find this issue?"
2,"DVD Audio Mix ""What Happened Here"" ???","The CD part of this is great thanks to Bob Clearmountain.But to sum the DVD part of this up. What a mess. It's a wonder that no one listened to this back before it was released.They forgot Peter Frampton In the Mix. Peter Mew credited, WHAT HAPPENED HERE?By the old DVD version period, (It's great compaired to this) I was hoping for an upgrade! Sorry.Will EMI fix I don't think so."
2,Package and Content Damaged and Not as Stated,"Package and Content Arrived Damaged and Not as Stated. Also, there was a hole drilled to the side of the Jewel Case, which is unacceptable to a collector. The fact that a Jewel Case has a hole drilled should be expressed as part of the description. Audio and video quality is mediocre. It is too bad because the performance in those days was exceptional. To be fair, this is a product best suited for the casual listener who does not ask for perfection."
5,Not Navigable But Very Readable,"This is a translation of the Aeneid into English by J W MacKail, M.A., Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford around 1885.The text follows Conngton and Nettleship and uses the commentary by Servius.This translation uses Juno instead of Hera, Jupiter instead of Zeus, Neptune instead of Poseidon, etc.Like many of the free Kindle downloads of classic books, this book is not navigable at the table of contents. You are left to start at the beginning and go to the end.I find it very readable:""Hardly out of sight of the land of Sicily did they set their sails to sea, and merrily upturned the salt foam with brazen prow, when Juno, the undying wound still deep in her heart, thus broke out alone..."""
2,"Turgid, an adjective.","...excessive or ornate, unneccesarily complex.(from the Latin tugere- to be swollen.)Mandlebaum's translation is heavy and dull, like an Al Gore speechfrom his pre-neo-populist days. The glossary is succinct and helpful, but there are so many references and classical allusions that putting the glossary in the back serves to frustrate the reader. An edition with facing-page glossary notes, like the old Folger Library Shakespeares, would be an immense help to the general reader.(The translator seems to emphasize capturing the original meter over rendering a breezy narrative. To be fair to Mandlebaum, Virgil ISN'T a light and lively poet, and unlike Homer he didn't write for a popular audience, at least not on purpose.)All in all, a serviceable but uninspiring translation, at least to boob like me."
4,A must read for all mythology fans,If you like the works of Homer then you will thoroughly enjoy The Aeneid. The story begins right after the fall of Troy and tells of the travels of the Trojans as they search for their destined land. Virgil writes very much in the style of Homer and anyone who is a fan of the Iliad and Odyssey will really enjoy this book.
4,Wonderful!,I love this documentary!Showing the old footage was the best for me. The more recent video of singers nowadays doesn't have the same feeling as the old times. Still very good.
5,Great history tool,I was so excited to view this. Using it as a tool for teaching my students. Definitely a must have for the library of true gospel singers and music historians.
5,Our HIstory,This a a very well done documentary that everyone should see. It will bring back some good memories and leave you feeling full.
2,It's just a toy.,"Don't waste your money, the picture is very dark and the pixels are the size of marbles. The only way to make it look decent is sitting it very close to the screen which is equivalent 15"" or so, even then the colors are way off. Kid's might like it but no conventional modifications make this worthwhile for anything else. For a little bit more you can get a used 1080 HD ready projector and get your moneys worth."
1,No Computer Hookup,"Since this was advertised as ""hooking up to a computer"" I purchased it for use with my laptop. This only accepts Red/White/Yellow connections. It comes with these on both ends to hook up to a DVD player. I was unable to find a store that sells the connection needed to hook up my computer to this, including radio shack."
2,Not any good for anything really,"It isn't bright enough to project, the resolution is bad and the colors are bad.Really a piece of junk"
4,"Gotta get ""Got Next!""","Whew! I guess living in the shadows of such superstardom as the infamous Winans clan, is not such a bad thing after all huh? These young men have taken what their perspective fathers gave them to another level. With the help of Rodney Jerkings (Dark Child), Phase 2 is one step beyond what we're used to hearing from The Winans. The album consistently hits you with a barage of new flava that compliments where gospel is going today. Maturity in time will only be an added compliment to the already higher level that they intended to reach. Very good listening."
5,Excellent Review,"This albulm is definitely worth buying. I listened to several of their songs online and that's how I familiarized myself with their unique sound.It's mellow, and it's just plain refreshing to listen to."
5,I'll admit. this even impressed ME!,"I didn't expect THIS type of R+B from thw Winans when I played this album, and I was taken aback from track one. Tracks like ""It's Alright"", ""Just For A Day"", ""Too Much Heaven"", and ""Always For You"" can match up to any major label R+B group on the mainstream secular music scene. The beats and lyrics roled on and mixed very well in this album to create a good feel to this CD. Looking forward to the sophomore release."
5,Awesome,"It's awesome to see fellow members of God's young generation keeping it real with God. Jesus said to seek first the kingdom of God and you guys have done just that. Don't ever let this world take you away from his ""Real Love"". This cd was TTTTIIIGGGHHHTTT, I can't stress how tight. Buy it, you won't regret it. God bless."
4,Contemporary Gospel at it's best!,"Winans Phase 2 prove that talent runs in the family! These guys deliver riveting melodies and powerful lyrics backed by new agebeats. But through all the contemporary beats, the timeless messages about Jesus and living a saved life shine through! The only downside is that the instrumental is all synthesized. If the music was actually played (via instruments) I think Phase 2 would be an even more un-stoppable force in Gospel Music. However they've already made their mark in the history and FUTURE of Gospel music. I definitely wasn't disappointed but the best way to judge is to try it on for size yourself! END"
3,Limited selection,"I do agree with other reviews - there's not much here and it's all already available. But I do have to comment on something I see over and over in these reviews - Warner Brothers doesn't own the rights to every movie ever made. The reason they can't include his great Western ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is because the rights are owned by Paramount Pictures, and ""Grapes of Wrath"" is owned by 20th Century Fox, just to name two."
2,Henry Fonda Signature Collection,"Mister Roberts was the best of the four movies. The other three movies weren't very good. Henry Fonda made much better movies than the three other movies in this ""Signature Collection"" Buying used might be worth the money. Paying full price is not.J.D. from Missouri"
3,Doesn't fit my van,"Even though the charts list my van as being included on a proper fit for this Power Flow 4766 (Amazon's and the manufacturer's) it does not. Unless I was willing to cut the front flaps top half totally off to clear the vehicles water drainage duct and the right rear to clear the tail pipe. 2010 KIA Sedona. Ordered factory mud flaps for 4 times the price, but at least they fit."
4,For Older People!,Really good read. Seemed possible. They want fifteen words here. So what can I say. It was an enjoyable read.
2,Can't do it ...,"finish it. I've tried. Schlink is a terrific writer. I enjoy his literary writings quite a bit, but I bought this one by mistake (assuming it was more literary than crime fiction). I'm not a PI fan and have pretty much no use for PI novels. This one, laced with what I found wanting in ""Homecoming"" by the same author, a tendency to be overbearing with introspective questions, made me shut the book and shove it in my briefcase this morning (alongside my drumsticks, which I wanted to take out and play to the Diana Krall recording of ""Frim Fram Sauce"").My bad ... I'll stick with his literature (and be more careful when buying on amazon) ...Definitely READ his literary novels, amici (they're very good) ... READ something, amici ... always READ"
2,Self's Punishment,"This book is not of the caliber that ""The Reader"" is. The description of too many mundane details make it easy to loose the jist of the story. Once you get to some important actions in the story they come across as contrived and far fetched. At the end of the book it seemed there was some vital piece of information that the author left out or did not reveal properly."
2,Half the tunes are fine,"I bought this CD, and although it contains a few of my all time favorite songs, the sound quality is terrible. All of the accompanying music is washed out, and the vocalists sound like they are using megaphones. I've heard better sound on my car radio. Love several of the tracks, hate the tinny sound."
4,We love Tommy!,"Okay, this isn't our daughter's favorite toy, but we think it's great. It's simple- no batteries, lights, etc. It promotes imagination- she can use it as an instrument or as a figure. And it taught her how to blow- a skill she now uses to cool down food, make wishes on dandelions, and blow bubbles. She can also suck in for a different sound. Oh, and the sound is hilarious to us- yes, annoying after awhile but so cute."
5,Music to Dream To,"I completely agree with the previous reviewier. This is absolutely lovely and sensitive music, crafted exquisitely. Gabriela is one of the undiscovered gems of South Amercian music."
5,Twisted and tasty,"""The Flying Witch,"" by Jane Yolen, is illustrated by Vladimir Vagin. The book tells the story of Baba Yaga, a Russian witch who flies around in a giant mortar-and-pestle. Her goal: to kidnap and eat a child!In the afterword, Yolen notes that she read a number of Baba Yaga stories in 3 books, but that the story here is her own. I imagine that a story whose main character wants to abduct and eat a child might not suit all tastes (forgive the pun), and that the portrayal of such a villainous witch might offend some Wiccan readers. But those issues aside, this is a wacky, fun, deliciously macabre book. The illustrations are really wonderful; Vagin successfully combines down-to-earth detail with fantastic imagery. Together the text and illustrations create a fairy tale world that has color and bite."
1,What a shame!!!!!,"Jeez...I'm not a native American, so English is not my first language, but the way these guys write is a shame! Please, take some English classes before even thinking on writing books!The way the content is presented is ""simply"" TERRIBLE!!!Don't waste your money or time on this!"
1,Was This Book Edited at All?,"It becomes immediately apparent in the first chapter that English is not the language of these authors. Before this book can help you understand IPv6, you must first master the poor grammer and fragmented sentence structure. The book appears to be unedited."
5,GOOD GAG,THIS IS A GOOD GAG PRODUCT ONLY THING IS YOU MIGHT GET DISCOURAGED WHEN YOU FIRST TRY IT AND SAY IT DOESN'T WORK BUT AS THE PACKAGE SAYS YOU GOT TO PLAY WITH IT TILL YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT THEN IT REALLY STARTS TO SOUND LIKE THE REAL THING.
5,Great ideas!,"Fun book with such cute ideas. This is my second ""pad"" book purchase. This first one I received as a gift nearly 10 years ago, and still love it. There is nothing like a good ol' retro cocktail party, so when I saw the guide to pad parties I went for it! It has some really cute ideas. I admit this book is not for everyone. However, if you are a lover of artsy, creative, vintage, or just looking for something different to inspire you, this is the one."
3,Extra Large Tissue - Very few in the box,"My biggest problem when I have a cold - besides small tissues is the box runs out so fast. So we get these and yes they are terrifically large tissues but if you are sick you could easily go through three boxes in a day. It's a complete waste of money in my opinion. The boxes are flat and slim but wide. For regular tissues, this would be a small amount in a box but since they are so much larger and folded more, there's even that much less tissue. I might buy them if they were in the big box - large tissues with plenty of them. But I'll never buy this set again. I didn't have a cold and the boxes still went fast."
5,Great large tissues,"These are the only tissues my husband will use. As a former devoted handkerchief man, he finally found these and is totally satisfied. They are very hard to find where we live and we found that ordering them through the subscribe and save is the way to go. We no longer find ourselves going to a grocery store solely to purchase these tissues. These are more sanitary than handkerchiefs but very durable without being coarse."
4,"Large, sturdy tissues",That about sums it up... These Kleenex are larger than normal size and pleasant to use.
3,Big box,"If you have a really runny nose, these tissues are for you!! However the box is awkwardly large and the tissues don't pop up."
4,Depends on who are using these,"It really depends on who is using these tissues to rate them.My husband and I really like them, because we normally need to grab two or three tissues to blow our noses (especially my husband) so we notice a box of these lasts much longer than a normal-sized box of tissues.My son (5) however, doesn't undstand the concept of ""folding over and using again"" so he wastes these tissues. Not a good idea for little noses...."
2,A mediocre performance,"I don't find this recording to be at all satisfactory. The orchestral playing is good enough and Puccini's colorful score gets a vivid, if not truly exceptional reading. Unfortunately, the singing leaves much to be desired. Jane Eaglen's Turandot is underpowered and she sounds like the character's same old haughty self even when she's supposed to be won over by Calaf's love. This is a very one-dimensional and uninteresting characterisation. Dennis O'Neill is caught here past his prime. Some of the high notes (and high lying passages) are rather effortful and the tenor is not in very fresh voice. Mary Plazas gives a tender performance of Liu with some beautifully spin-out high notes. Hers is the best performance of the set. The other roles are adequately taken but it's good of have Gedda as the Emperor."
2,Eaglen disappoints,"Jane Eaglen has often been touted as the coming great dramatic soprano. However, her recorded work doesn't give people any such impression. Her Turandot on this set is underpowered, unsteady and unfeeling. It's just a cardboard protrayal without any real vocal or interpretative distinction. The other members of the cast perform adequately."
3,i have always enjoyed John Cusack's work,i have always enjoyed John Cusack's work and the presence of Minnie Driver and Jack Black does not hurt either.
2,Anamorphic Grosse Point Blank? No!,"If you're thinking of replacing the 1998 non-Ana Buena Vista DVD of GPB (717951000408) with this one, don't - it's still not..."
3,Great Movie Lousy delivery,Nothing wrong with the movie. But it took a really long time to arrive from a not so good Amazon partner.
5,Widescreen? Yes!,"This IS widescreen, not the sloppy pan & scan. Especially with High Fidelity I would think you'd want to see everything the excellent director, Stephen Frears puts on the screen - a WIDE SCREEN. Also, High Fidelity is enhanced for 16x9 TVs.The transfer is not 100% (the print used for Grosse Pointe Blank looks a touch worn - ocassional scratches), but the single version DVDs are none better.This is a real bargain and a great double feature."
5,John Cusak rocks,"First is Gross Point Blank. Nothing more attractive than a man that can kick ass whilst being a tortured soul....what could possibly be more appealing? (Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.. possibly). Anyway, very funny, dark, and, of course, the 80s references that I, oh ma gah, love.High Fidelity is one of my favorite movies (the book is great too). I think, Jack Black's best performance. And the movie touches on some of my own themes, music and critical snobbery without actually having talent yourself. Again, very funny and relative. You can watch them over and over...I do."
4,2 PACK,"GOT IT FOR ONE OF THE MOVIES THE OTHER WAS A BONUS. WATCHED THEM BOTH SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY, AND WILL WATCH AGAIN."
3,Not the songs I would have picked,"I love music from the 70's, and being in my 40's I recall much of that era. But this collection contained a lot of unknown songs, which I believe are by British artists. I grew up in California listening to the radio, and most of these songs are unfamiliar to me. I actually suspect this may be a British compilation.There are several American hits in here too, but out of the 5-CD set, I ended up deleting all but 17 songs upon ripping. I just hadn't heard them or they weren't representative enough of my experience of the music of the '70's."
4,These stories took me back to my youth,"I read many of these stories in other compilations when I was but a wee lad, and I really enjoyed picking up this anthology, over thirty years hence.The lead story, ""Footsteps Invisible,"" is a nice scary story with a rather surprising ending.I bought this one largely on the basis of my foggy memory of ""The Rose-Crystal Bell,"" which I had thought was a retelling of the classic ""The Monkey's Paw.""It turned out to be pretty good, but lacking the truly chilling punch of the other story, which is a true masterwork to keep you up at night.""The Wonderful Day"" injects some real humor as a great ""what if"" story.The other stories found here are also really good.If you have a nostalgic streak, you can't go wrong here."
4,"If you enjoy a good ""Twilight Zone,"" this is for you","I first encountered the short story, ""The Marvelous Stamps of El Dorado"" reprinted in my sixth-, seventh-, or eighth-grade reader, and it has been returning to my thoughts occasionaly ever since. When it did so most recently, I did some research, found that it was in this volume, and tracked down a copy. It was as good as I remember it, and the other stories in the volume are on a par with it, and they all seem to be potential ""Twilight Zone"" fodder.While it was originally marketed as a children's book, it holds up well for readers of all ages."
5,Entertainment for all ages,"I bought this book for my nephews, and decided to read it before giving it away. The Strega Borgia family is even funnier than ever in this book. Their tumble down castle's roof is falling in and they have to move out so that the contractors can work. Little do they know that the evil contractor want to buy the castle cheap, so that he can build a cheap housing development. He and his crew do their best to destroy the castle. The family has to live in an hotel in the nearby village. The dragon, crocodile, yeti and griffin aren't exactly welcome. The proprietress has designs on Luciano, and Titus is using his computer to make clones. Pandora is upset about leaving Multitudina and Tarantella behind. Then, there is the mystery of the Strega Borgia diamond.This is a really great book for both children and adults. It makes bedtime stories a little more fun for everyone."
5,"Blends magic, humor, and story","Blend magic, humor, and story revolving around a family's household disaster and the creation of 500 miniature pink, naked clones and you have Pure Dead Wicked, a zany novel semi-rooted in the reality of a family facing house problems with a difference. Young adults who appreciate humor and fantasy blends will appreciate this funny story - just in time for Halloween."
3,"a crazy and ""wicked"" book","Pure Dead Wicked by Debi Gliori is a decent book but I would not reccomend it for younger reader because it has several difficult words to read and understand, particularly the proper nouns. I would reccomed this book to middle aged readers or more advanced reader who enjoy books with plenty of action without going overboard . The book moves along quite consistantly and the plot is somewhat is somewhat interesting. This book is fairly easy to read and i would rate this book at three (3) stars."
2,Not appropriate for young readers,"I don't screen all of the books my 8-year-old daughter reads, but I was glad that I read this one first. I agree the story is great and will appeal to children, but the gross-out language and talk of boy parts and pregnancy were inappropriate for my 3rd - grader. Before allowing anyone under the age of 10 to read this book, I would consider screening it for yourself first, and then decide if it's appropriate for your young reader."
3,Good Taste,"The jar I received came intact. The jelly was tasteful but it was a little watery and loose. It was as if the Quince Jelly had not set-up. I ended up using it in many recipes instead of being able to have it on toast or english muffins. For example: I made a wonderful Polish sausage and sauerkraut where I cooked the Polish Sausage with a little water and about 1/4 cup of the jelly until it browned on all sides, then I added the sauerkraut, chopped apples, bay leaf, a little brown sugar (sweet and sour) into the pan with the sausage. I garnished it with some pimento stuffed Quenn olives for presentation. It was delicious and everyone wanted the scoop on how I got the sweet-sour flavor. I may have just been sent a poorly set batch but would not re-order because I really wanted a breakfast/toast jelly. I had to improvise and use it in other ways."
3,Not Sheep in a Jeep,"We purchased this book as a follow-up to Sheep in a Jeep. It's okay, but not as smooth, rhythmic and funny as first book."
4,Feeling Sheepish?,"Having a 7 month old son and two other older children, I have seen my share of board books. I like to consider myself an expert on the truly good children's book. Nancy Shaw's delightful sheep have met all my marks. They are a delight not only for children, but for parents as well. The gently cadenced prose coupled with Margot Apple's witty illustrations holds more than just a giggle for the tiny tots. I appreciate it when an author is able to pair rhyme for the toddlers with underlying humor for the older set."
4,Edited porn - some hot Euro trash,This is another Private porno movie edited for Penthouse. There are two scenes in which you get some great pink shots. One is a three way boy/girl/girl the other is boy/girl. The girls are hot and all do some nice petting on their male counterparts. This movie is hotter then other Variations videos. They make a point of letting you see the beautiful women in all their glory. I am sure the hard core version is amazing.
1,Horrible,This was the worst idea I ever had I never even got the lighters they sent It to the wrong house and said they couldn't sent it back and would refund my money which they never did
4,Out performs deprecated VMT-100,"This control is far and away better than the older version, the VMT-100, sold for about the same price. I get more wattage and more low end response from my speakers, its almost worth changing out all of my VMT-100's for these.It loses a star for the wiring. Why oh why does Phoenix still insist on using these horrid connectors on all of our their controls? The connectors are not big enough to accomodate large wire (lower guage), and the connections are anything but secure, and I've had them come off many times while trying to tuck them into the wall.Otherwise a great volume control for the price, you get minimum quality and wattage loss. You're not going to get high fidelity, but its enough for a whole house audio system for parties, etc."
2,Very Difficult to Install,"I spent two hours attempting to attach input and output speaker wires to this unit. As other reviewers have written, the holes for accepting the wires are too small for quality gauge wiring like that made for running within walls. Plus, the screws intended to grip the wires do not get a tight enough grip to hold them while you insert the unit into the wall box. You have to attach 8 wires - 4 incoming, 4 outgoing -- but getting and keeping all 8 attached while installing the unit is nigh impossible, even after trimming the gauge back to fit in the holes. At least one pops loose in every attempt. I gave up and ordered a competitor's product -- the Niles Audio VCS100R. Hopefully it will be more installer-friendly than Phoenix Gold."
2,My boyfriend's back,"I have seen this movie quiet a few times. I mustsay that I didn't enjoy it to much. I usually onlywatched it when there was nothing on and I fell asleepwith it on. I never really got the idea, I new they werefriends, but when he came back, he wasn't her boyfriend.I liked the original my boyfriends back, it was in 1989.It starred judith light, sandy duncan, and jill eikenberry.I don't know if it was ever released on video, that movie wouldget 5stars from me, this version I would say only 2stars to benice."
3,My Boyfriends Back,"I am looking for the same dvd as one of the other reviewers, about the 60's group reuniting. If anyone knows where I could get this dvd or vhs please let me know. Thank you."
3,"File under: ""Will never get the credit it deserves""","Honestly, I can't stress enough that this movie, while not particularly good on the surface, is much smarter than it appears. The entire cast acts under the hazy impression that rising zombies aren't that out of the ordinary. Seeing a high-schooler chastise his undead friend for eating another student with the line ""Colleges look at this sort of thing!"" is indicative of the type of humor at work here. Take it for what it's worth. No, this isn't Oscar material, but 20 years from now, this will be a cult classic. I laughed all the way through at the concept of a zombie's (living) parents gleefully assisting in his cannabalism. But hey, that's just me."
2,"""And As You Can See, He's Got An Axe In His Head...""","This black comedy is not great art. It's silly, cheesy, and totally ridiculous....and I like it!!. I'm always a sucker for stupid B movie films like this. It's fun and funny in a really stupid way. Andrew Lowery stars as a kid who has the hots for a girl. In an attempt to show off to her, he gets killed by a store robber. He comes back as a zombie and begins to live life as if nothing ever happened. Of course, there are certain body parts that fall off and stuff, but that's to be expected from a rotting corpse. There are a few jokes and gags in here that are genuinely funny, in a sophmoric way. The best come from chacrter actor Austin Pendleton as a nutty doctor. The rest of the cast include : Paul Dooley, Edward Herrmann, Cloris Leachman, and Mary Beth Hurt. It's a juvenile comedy with a somewhat delightful and appealing presence. If your into that sort of thing, then you will probably enjoy this. Otherwise, stay far away."
5,A Delight-The best,"I couldn't believe when I first read that this wonderful, witty, funny movie is on DVD. I now finally own it on DVD and it's just fantastic. The picture quality is really good, the sound is beautiful-no complaints. I'm so happy with it. Now some people might think that this is a silly, maybe even cheesy movie, but it's quite the opposite.The casting is perfect, I wouldn't change a thing. I absolutly LOVE TRACI LIN or is credited as Traci Lind with a d. Every film I see her in I love, She is just spectacular. She really is one of the best actress' of her time. I hope and pray that Fright Night 2' gets a DVD release. The storyline in this film is just charming and one of a kind.Johnny Dingles love for Missy McCloud is sweet and believeable. The end sequence is the cream of the crop. This is one of those films where you just feel good. There's a good feeling about this film. And it delivers on all fronts."
1,this is offull,"i wish i can give it 0 stars, but that isn't one of the choices.this movie really.really.... stinks. Don't watch this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you wast time,money, and brains. And i kow good movies!!!!1 (when i see one.)"
2,horrible!,I use to love this movie! Definately does NOT stand the test of time. I bought for my husband to watch with me and I gotta say I was embarrasred that i picked it.
4,Loved It!,I've been in love with this movie since it came out in the 90's. Its a low budget movie but it is so cute. It shows just how far some people are willing to go for the ones they love
3,outdated,I saw this movie when I was a young child and liked it. I guess it is better to not watch as an adult because it is corny as all get out.
5,Marko Petkovsek spins a brillant portrayl of data,Marko Petkovsek may be the first of a new generation of writers who bring life to a dry stle of instructional materials.A non stop thriller of statistacal information.A MUST READ.
2,Continual pain,"Never worked properly in windows 2000, but that could be due to something else. However:If you have this MA311 card in a Windows 2000 computer then upgrade to XP, IT WILL NOT WORK!I have tried this process on two separate PCs; the card is then unusable in that machine afterwards, no amount of changing PCI slots, un/reinstalling drivers helps, you just various annoying windows errors such as 'driver installation was unsuccessful'.Tech support are quite useless and sound very much like they're reading from a script, mainly because that's exactly what they're doing."
3,Works ok after debugging and I never got rebate from netgear,"I purchased this to go with my 814 router. I set up the card in my kid's computer and I could not get it to work. Even though the machines could see each other, data wouldn't transmit. It looked like the WEP encryption was incorrect. I spent many hours trying to get it working and finally contacted tech support. I got a reply with a list of suggestions which I had already tried. I had a hunch that the WEP encryption probably changed the upper/lower case to something else(can't verify it since all you see is '***' because I could put in the WEP code and it would work until restarting, when it wouldn't work again. The workaround was to change my WEP to numbers only, no ascii. It has been working fine since."
1,Fails to work in WEP mode,"My MA311 PCI card works well when it's not in WEP (wireless equivalent protocol) mode. WEP is basically encryption that encodes the wireless traffic, providing some protection from hackers.The MA311 does NOT work in WEP mode with the MR814 router. Period.Technical support hold times for Netgear are typically over 2 hours. After spending a total of 3 hours on the phone with their technical support person, my problem was ""forwarded"" to an ""engineer"" at Netgear for follow-up. That was 2 months ago. They never bothered to contact me.Not terribly impressive, the company or their product. Avoid Netgear."
1,Poor product; worse support,I purchased this card over two years ago. It has spent most of its time in a drawer. Why? Because it does not work well enough to use. Drops connection intermittently and requires that the netgear wireless router be power-cycled to clear open connections. I spent countless hours modifying settings and updating drivers to remediate the problem without resolution. Their tech support could only offer an update of drivers as a solution...when this did not work they would not respond to any of my emails. I left three voice mails with their tech support manager (Shelly) who would not return any of my calls. I do not recommend this product...and with the lack of support...i would not reccomend any product from this company.
1,MA311 - Nice as a cosmetic tail - but thats about it,"Since I've put this into my PC, I've broken 3 keyboards through frustration. On top of list price its cost me 3000 in anger management courses! hehe (joke)However, absolutely useless with Win2000, it makes no sense. Installing the drivers before you put the card in your pc is also bizarre.Reverted back to an old netgear MA101, which doesnt let me see my network, but lets me use the net through our gateway. Odd, but it does me for what i need.RegardsJamesUK"
2,Could not make it work under W98SE,"I spent a good 4 hours trying to make this card work under WIndows 98SE. The documentation is pretty much useless as far as troubleshooting. Actually, the online documentation for the MA814 router is more usefull in term of configuration of the wireless cards. What is strange is that the card could ""see"" the router, but it would not connect eventhough the router was located next to it and the security options were all disabled. So I decided to out this card in my XP machine instead and it worked fine there."
1,Doesn't interwork well with other Netgear products,"It took me about 2 weeks of off-and-on work to finally get this card to work. I had to call tech support, spent 20 mintues on hold, and then another 50 minutes talking with a person who didn't help and was vaguely insulting. In the end, he incorrectly diagnosed a hardware problem. I finally fixed the problem after the call by reloading the driver.The basic problem is that the card's encryption options are difficult to use and don't match those of the Netgear MR814 router. I would NOT buy any more Netgear products."
4,Works well under Windows 2000 and RedHat Linux,"I have this card (Netgear MA311) installed in dual-bootable computer, which runs either Windows 2000 Professional, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0. Works well under both operating systems. Originally I was using it with Netgear MR814 router, later replaced it [the router] with 2WIRE 1701HG Gateway, provided with SBC Yahoo! DSL connection. Can't complain about anything."
5,Fantasic with XP,Intstalled as promised and worked great with my Linksys router. Much better than the Linksys PCI card
2,locks up under linux,"Talking to the MR814 router it hangs on large outgoing data transfers after 70-80 Megs, and won't do anything at all until the machine is power-cycled. Works fine for web-surfing and downloads, but don't expect to do backups through it."
1,Range Claims exagerated,"Wire less Router MR814V2. I got everything to work right out of the box pretty quickly and easily. Have three computers running through it, one using a standard rj45 cable, which works quite well. The other is using the MA311 PCI wireless card, and a Dell laptop using MA401. At a distance of 80 to 90 feet through the house the MA311 gets a 30% signal at best, and the MA401 gets 0% and will not connect to router. Tech support stepped me though a few things. But ended up telling me it's too far away from the base station, and that it was not really designed to function in a 2-Story Environment. I have limited experience with this type of networking but it seems that with a claim of 500 feet max range, an 80 foot distance should be working much better."
5,Harrap's produces the best foreign language dictionaries,"I've use Harrap's French, German and Spanish foreign language dictionaries and they are far superior to any dictionary I've used before, are idiomatic, informative, easy-to-use and wider-reaching than any other resource I've used. You will not be disappointed with this purchase!"
2,"Nice to know, but too complicated, abstract and unpragmatic","This book has some value even today, but I was quite bored during reading this book. I often noticed that Fowler has gift of describing simple things in complicated (and boring) ways, which happened many times in this particular book. I felt like this book was born in those ""pattern days"" where everyone tried to create own patterns on everything in the world. Fowler tries to describe some common domain problems and introduce various patterns that are supposed to deal with them.Some of them are quite nice and good at least to think about, but other were explained in very abstract manner, with weird (pre UML) pictures of often over-complicated problematics that poorly illustrated the domain problem.If your job is programming, you won't miss much if you ignore this book. If you are analyst, you should at least consider it, but it still isn't what you call ""must read""."
5,"Ground Breaking, and Ahead of its time","When Fowler wrote this book, patterns were still in its infancy in the IT world. His book was a brilliant eye opener and in my view never got the recognition it should receive. Analysis patterns lays the ground work for thinking about business information entities, business activities, and business processes as belonging to a family of archetypes that can be characterized across all organizations. The power of this thinking has been proved correct as we have evolved business models in the internet age. In my review of the book linked below, it is clear that this notion of business patterns plays a key role in being able to control the emerging infrastructure beast that is affecting all of IT.AsNext Generation Datacenters in Financial Services: Driving Extreme Efficiency and Effective Cost Savings (Complete Technology Guides for Financial Services)Fowler is a pioneer and this book should be on every serious IT professionals book shelf."
3,"If convert to UML, all the relations are association.","If one convert the author's pattern diagram to UML (the standard in industry), he/she will find that all the diagrams in the book are actually ""association"" relationship. There are no inheritance, no containment, no navigation in his patterns. It looks boring since only ""association"" relations were used. Probably that is why the author did not draw the diagram with UML, although he said he wanted to."
3,A bit too abstract,"There are lots of interesting ideas here, but the actual patterns themselves are not that useful as they are too abstract."
5,indispensable for those using OO analysis,"I've got most of the books on patterns and find that this is the one I use the most. The writing is clear, the patterns address problems that I run into, and mostly the solutions are just what I need. This book is great to give to analysts who are having trouble agreeing with each other, because they often are persuaded by the book. It is great to give to analysts who are trying to master OO concepts, or to programmers who don't understand why things have to be so complicated. Everybody I know who has read it likes it. I just wish more people would read it!The only thing I don't like about the book is the notation. I wish he had used UML. On the other hand, after you spend a few days with it, it isn't hard to understand. It is just one more notation."
2,Swimming through mud.,"I found this book very hard to work with. I'm convinced that the book's models and ideas have merit once they can be understood but getting that level of understanding is being very difficult. I've had colleagues also attempt to get to grips with this book to see if was just me, but all of us have had the same problem. This book explains scenarios at a reasonably understandable level for each of the examples and then dives very quickly into the abstract without a clear path of how things relate to the original problems. Other issues were the use of smalltalk for examples (smalltalk may be a fine language, but it's hardly intuitive for c,java or vb programmers), and the decision not to use UML for diagrams."
4,A little dispointed for an excellent book,"This is certainly a good book about patterns. I found it clearly written by the author. Also he provided his own graphics symbols on the front and back pages in his book so we can understand the patterns in his book. However, he chose smalltalk to explain his codes. I think most readers are more familiar with C++ or Java than smalltalk. I wish he could provide those sample code on the addison-wesley web site (or his own site) with Java or C++. He promised (in his book, page xix) to put ""further materials to keep this book alive"". However, I did not see much update on this site or his own home page on this book."
3,I don't notice any difference,"I have used this a couple times with my anxious 6 year old. I don't notice a difference. That's not to say it doesn't work at all, but I don't notice. Maybe I need to use more than the package recommends. I didn't think he would like the taste, but he was ok with it in a cup of water. But he didn't even notice it in a cup of juice. I don't think I would recommend it, but it's so cheap, its worth a shot."
3,First Time bidder,"I thought that this was a build and take-apart toy. Since it was prebuilt and I was looking for a toy that my grandson could put together for educational value, it was a disappointment. But, I am expecting a baby grandson next month, so he will receive it as a gift on his first birthday."
2,What the hell?,"I really liked SLSGIR and my friend told me how good this CD was and that I would love it. So I bought it. This CD was great until I started reading the lyrics and trying to understand what where this band is coming from. RN seems to be against everything and everyone in America accept those who are exactly like them. It's pretty ironic how this band is so headstrong on not hurting animals but love singing about torturing humans...(Just a sidenote, it seems that the new trend of metal bands is to write lirics that are full of hate and just talk about mindless killing, then give an interview speaking out against war and Americans. It seem a little contradictory.)Other than all of the nonsense in this album, it is decent enough to download, but I wouldn't waste the money on buying it."
2,not that good,"i just saw these guys along with the greatest band to ever walk the earth(ZAO) and i wasn't impressed.but, there cd was only 10 bucks and alot of people there were wearing their shirts so i thought they must be good and i got it. i liked it for about a week then i started to hate it . i only like track 3 now. DONT BUY THIS ! BIG WASTE OF MONEY! buy zao's where blood and fiore bring rest insted."
2,Give me a break,"Let's sing about something other than george bush sucks. Sure, I might agree but if I want to listen to politics I will turn on talk radio or the news. When I want to listen to music I just want to kick back and enjoy. Also some of their lyrics are a little to hippie radical and far fetched. If you must have your politics and music mixed there are plenty of BETTER bands out there to waste your money on. This one just has a repetetive theme of boooooriiiiing"
5,What a record!!!,"From go to whoah this record kicks butt. It's been on rotation in my car for 3 weeks. Non stop brutality. As an old school metaller I'm impressed to see they've ditched the punk/hardcore elements of their earlier releases and gone flat-out metal. This album also features a nice little cover of Pantera's ""Stronger than All"" at the end of the final track.If you're into hardcore, metalcore or whatever, check this one out. A worthy addition to the collection."
2,too repetitive,"Compared to She looks so good in red, this cd is a big letdown. I was looking at a listening station at the local record store and i saw the latest Remembering Never cd. I thought SLSGIR was pretty decent so i decided to check this one out. I listened to the first two tracks and thought they were good also, and me being the idiot that i am bought it without skimming through the whole cd. I went home and put it in my cd player and found out that the remaining eight tracks sounded pretty much the same as the first two. It was just the same loud and heavy breakdown over and over again. I was disappointed because the whole cd just lags unlike SLSGIR. It doesn't even matter to me what Remembering Never's beliefs are or that they think hardcore sucks right now. Hardcore is mainly about the music and the message, and the music and the message that Remembering Never brings to the table is unfortunately not good or original at all. Save yourself the trouble and don't buy this cd."
2,"Not bad, but not good","I have mixed reactions to this cd. It is brutal harcdore with a message, but it is lacking that touch of musical melody to draw me in and want to listen to it. She Looks so Good in Red, was too soft, too light. This cd is too hardcore, too out of control. A mix of the two would be a five star collaboration.Favs, Incisions, serenading this dead horse"
4,breakaway band from ex- Fair Warning vocalist,"is you are a Fair warning fan,then this is a musthave...this is the band formed shortly after the lead vocalist departed the band Fai Warning...a mistake in my opinion,but that's his choice he made...i must say I was expecting a lot from the hype i read,and as a result , was slightly disappointed after i heard it...dont get me wrong,it's a great rock-n-roll ride,but it's been done before and by better bands...hoping the followup will surpass this one...still a great effort overall though"
4,Cat crap,"Works really good. I wear my glasses when i paintball, so this helps with fog on both lens(mask lens & eye lens)"
4,Very good solution for sweating people,The product works very well for people who sweats a lot and uses lenses for doing excersise.The results are even better when the lenses are wore outdoor
5,WOW!!!,This man is indeed the King of all the praise and worship leaders/ Humility and service are heard in every song I have ever heard him do. His voice is strong and undeniably full of the power of God. This is a must for those seeking a deeper more meaningful eb=ncounter with God.
3,TV-Guide hell,"I'm not sure I would fully have appreciated the negative comments about the tv-guide function before I got the dvr, based on very favorable reviews elsewhere. But after the first night of listening to the endless chirping I deduced that it was downloading or trying to download tv-guide info from the mothership. Sure enough, in tv-guide setup mode it stops chirping. After hours of trying to figure out how to disable the tv-guide, a web search brought me here and confirmed my worst fears. I will have to find a less convenient place for this thing to live if I don't want to hear the chirping 24/7.2010: Now Comcast has fully crippled its tvguide functions and its timekeeping. Resetting the clock requires going through the entire initial setup - about 10 minutes of aggravation. This thing is now an antiquated pig."
3,unreliable TV Guide Function,"If you care about a working reliable TV Guide function, skip this product. Works well for about 10 days - then needs to be reset and may take a week to come back again and you loose all your customized channel settings. Tech support is polite but wholly uninformed. I even spoke with their engineers, who never got back to me. I tried two of these units simaltanously, and one would work while the other did not and visa versa - so its not my cable company. Lots of very nice well thought out features - if you don't care about the TV Guide, go for it. I am returning mine and getting the Panasonic."
1,Fatal Flaw - Hard Disk Thrashing,"Several of the customer reviews that disappeared when Amazon restocked the 533 spoke of the noise from the hard disk actuator as it banged away incessantly. But for the design defect of failing to provide real memory to store the TV-Guide information the Pioneer would be far preferable to the machine I replaced it with when my 533's hard disk failed two days after receiving it from Amazon. If you have time, wait for the 533/633 models to be replaced. The Pioneer human interface is excellent. I did not have time and bought something else roughly comparable in price that works fine for recording cable TV but is far less adept at editing the VHS tapes I am moving to DVD."
2,R.Thomas,"This is my 5th DVR (all Pioneer) and the first with TV Guide. I would NOT buy this unit again!ISSUES:1. The automatic TV Guide feature causes my unit to be on about 18 hours a day. I can hear it thrashing the hard disk constantly. Why does it take so long to get programming???2. It is very difficult to find the manual timed programming mode, or to make changes to the TV Guide programming. The menu's are hard to use for this feature (which is mostly the way I want to program).3. There seems to be much less disk space available on the DVR for shows than the older units (which I like SO MUCH BETTER). Maybe this is due to the space TV Guide takes.I would trade my unit for one of the older 420/520 units ASAP!and would not buy another Pioneer DVR until they fix the interface."
3,flawed but good enough for my aims,"Clock constantly resets itself but does not seem to do so when a recording is programmed. I manually reset it through initial setup. Following a recommendation by another amazon reviewer, I entered a canadian zip code in the set up procedure to avoid all the downloading problems amply covered in other amazon customer reviews of this product. It works. Otherwise no problems. It has revolutionized the way I watch t.v."
5,Christmas Miracle,"I have seen all of the ""Touched by an Angel"" episodes and enjoy them all! Right now one of my favorite is ""Christmas Miracle"". I like the songs and the singing and the story line is always inspirational."

4,Very handy,I like this sanding pad as a wood turner I'm always on the the look out for a good sanding aid. This sanding pad is very handy. Only 4 stars because it is a tad over priced for what it is. If it were a few dollars less I would buy a couple.
1,OK,"Be advised you will get 2 driver side mats. This makes for low rating on this product. When you enter the passenger side the writing DODGE is upside down. Other than that they are OK floor mats, not anything great."
1,Explosion,The other two reviews were very correct. I replaced my hose and needed to use my product. It leaked alot with my last hose and probably that was a good thing as when I turned the water on I walked to the product but before I got close the product exploded and as the other reviews state it sounded like a gun shot and pieces were all through the yard. My new hose provided a better leak proof connection but too much pressure on the product. I had the water turned on half way. If you buy this or use it don't ever turn the product lever to off or serious injury may happen to you. Since this product has been around I have to believe there are many lawsuits pending. Buy a pressure washer or use a regular hose sprayer.
3,Just ok,this cd is nothing great. There are about 3 good songs on here. candy is ok. nothing special...i wouldent waste my money if i were you. if u really want her cd get her best ~first things~
1,Worst ever translation of the Classic,"I have trained under Mantak Chia, read every work of his and also studied under Winn, Chunyi Lin, Jenny Lamb and a host of other Taoist teachers. I have also studied every popular translation of the great Taoist classic and this has to be the worst ever. I knew about Mantak Chia's level of understanding also corroborated by Master Choa kok sui but this book proves it. Save your money."
4,clear as crystal,"This book is the most clearly written book I have ever read. Liddle has a knack for making difficult concepts easy to comprehend through his use of analogies and vividly accurate descriptions. The cosmological ideas are explained at an intuitive level and have been imprinted on my mind forever. This book is a great introduction for the less mathematically minded though also a great source of information for others. This book book covers a great amount of cosmology the big bang, nucloesynthesis, inflation, cosmological models etc and is set out in a very logical order. I would thoroughly recommend this as an introduction although for those interested in more mathematical rigour other text books may be necessary.Well done Dr. Liddle ! A great achievement ............."
2,I wish I'd gotten Thera-Band instead,"I got red and a blue Cando bars. They feel almost identical, but testing them against each other it is clear that the red one is a bit stiffer than the blue, meaning it is more that 2 categories too strong! So it was obviously a waste of money to get two. Also, it seems like it must be a bit random what kind of strength you get...which is uncool.Based on watching the 'Tyler Twist' youtube videos it is clear that my red one is FAR stiffer than the Thera-Band red. And it looks like light, or most probably the mid-strength green level, would be a better initial elbow therapy point. And now I'll have to order a Thera-Band bar to test that.Other than the horrible drawback of not being able to properly choose strength, I guess they seem well made enough...for whatever that is worth."
3,nice quality but...,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received this hanger. For the price it is very sturdy and nice looking. The only downside to this hanger is the wood inside the holes is rough. I have many silk scarves and the material was catching when I drew it through the holes. My other scarves made of cotton, rayon, etc. did not have issues. It probably wouldn't take much effort to sand the holes, but it should have been done by the manufacturer."
1,too rough for silk scarves,"I should have returned this scarf hanger out of principle, because it was initially unusable. The holes all had rough edges that would snag any scarf that was unfortunate to get near it. My husband being handy said he would try sanding down the rough edges. This was a big job because the wood is hard and not easy to sand. He had to use several different items, including some wood filler, to make the wood smooth enough. It is usable now, but how ridiculus is a scarf hanger that ruins scarves?"
2,Great Idea But Snags Your Scarves,"This product looks great; wood-like, not plastic, and nice/heavy feel to it. However, the deal-killer is that the inside of the holes are so rough, when you pull your scarf or tie through it the material gets seriously snagged. At least, the one I received is this way. I'm very disappointed. My husband thought he could sand away the roughness but that didn't work. It's very strange that the roughness cannot be sanded away. Perhaps, it's not made of wood after-all? So Sad :("
5,Scarf Rack review - amazing item!,"I bought this scarf rack after seeing it in my friends closet. I had to have it. I found it easily on Amazon.com, ordered it, and received it in less than one week. My scarves are organized and it looks beautiful like a decoration. I am almost tempted to display the rack in my room. You have to get this for your scarves. I will surely buy a few of them as gifts this holiday season."
5,Perfect !,The scarf hanger was absolutely perfect for my needs. Well-made and attractive and really solves the problem of HOW to store my scarves!
5,Scarf Hanger,Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! It neatly hangs all of my scarves and gives me a full view of what I have.
2,Great Design - Poor Execution,"I LOVE scarves and have dozens - silks, cottons, wools....all different sizes and shapes. I thought these holders would be the ultimate storage/display for my scarves: while the design SEEMS like it is ideal for scarves, when I hang them, the scarves are bulky and can wrinkle. Some medium length scarves of blended or synthetic fabrics work well in the hangers, but the wools, cottons and silks are better stored folded in an air-tight container. I'm keeping the holders as they are great for heavy coats larger items."
5,Scarves,I was really impressed with this heavy duty wooden Scarf Hanger. Now I don't have to dig in the drawer for what I'm looking for.
3,Great....but....,"I thought this would be the answer to my ""Scarf"" organizational dilemma...The idea/concept is A+..but the holes in the hanger are pretty rough & unfortunately ""pulled threads, etc"" on some of my favorite scarves before I realized the damage. I would suugest they sand/smooth the inside of the holes or finish them w. the same finish on the hanger itself.... GREAT CONCEPT for organizing scarves ...just a bit ""rough around the edges""!"
5,Happy Organizer!,"Didn't know something like this existed! After cleaning out my closet, I noticed a ton of scarves I had.Found this hanger and I am so happy with it. Read some reviews that it pulled some scarves and wasn't smooth.I do agree with that. This finish isn't as smooth as it should be, so I wouldn't pull any delicate fabric ones through it."
2,Mixed review,"The holes through which you hang fabric is rough - not sanded enough - so this is very bad for my silk scarves. If you are hanging sturdy fabrics, this is for you. If you are hanging delicates, do not purchase this."
4,Nice solution,"I really like this for organizing my scarves. It seems very durable. I see other people complaining about the roughness of the holes, and can attest they are sort of rough. I put my silk scarves in a fabric covered scarf hanger, though, so this isn't a problem for me. My only complaint would be that for thicker scarves, the holes are little close together. Overall though I think this is a nice product."
4,Scarf Hangers,These hangers are the perfect solution to owning lots of scarves. I purchased several of them and have my scarves color coordinated hanging in my closet. They make it very easy to find the scarf you are looking for! They are also well made.
