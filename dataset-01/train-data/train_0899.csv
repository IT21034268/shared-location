4,as advertised,Got this as a satchel to complete my Indiana Jones costume. It worked out fine. Seems pretty heavy duty. Prob not going to use it again any time soon but it was easy to adjust the strap and I didn't have any problems with it the one night I wore it.
2,Black Canvas Map Case Shoulder Bag,"In retrospect, I should not have purchased this bag. The ""yellow"" lights were blinking in my head as I was completing the paypal process. Why? It's quite obvious. That is, obvious to me. The bag is taller than wide. Which means, digging around in the bag to find what I am looking for. The fact that it has a divider to separate the contents does not matter. The bag was also, in overall size, too small. Another concern, which I chose not to think about, was the fabric. Canvas fabric is ""tough and rough(rough to the touch)."" What else would one expect from ""canvas."" But for a purse...well for me. No. Thank you.I will say this, the bag is well made: fabric, stitching and hardware. I have no doubt, this will make a good purse or ""man bag"" for the right person."
5,map or drawing case,"Great for holding drawing pens pads and all other things.I want to get another one soon!I am in a wheelchair and it is so helful carring all my art things whever I go,and I don't lose them like before!"
3,Good for the price,"Works well for the size. The straps attach in a very awkward way on the back of the case, making it kind of awkward to carry."
2,Strap broke after 2nd day,"After only my second day of using the bag, the strap broke. I had a tablet and 2 normal sized books in it. I was very disappointed with this product. It would have worked out great since everything fit inside perfectly."
3,"Good bag, but missing some details","I bought a bag like this on Haight Street a few years ago, before giving it away. It's a handy bag with a divided inner compartment and a front area for organizing pens and holding a small journal. I finally decided to replace it.My complaints:My original bag had a plastic map sleeve on the back, the one I ordered does not.The shoulder strap is just canvas. No padding. No spreader to distribute the weight.Neither of these items are important enough to cause a return, especially on a value item like this. If the plastic map pocket is vital, keep looking. This isn't the bag for you."
5,Very Good!,"I found this item while looking for a pouch to carry my paleontology supplies into the field with me. This was a great buy! It turned out to be the perfect size for what I was looking for. Its made of good material and a real strap, as opposed to a plastic one. And for the price, IF it every breaks or gets lost...its cheap to replace! The backing was a bit harder than I expected, but its fine."
1,Disappointed - broke in less than 5 min into use,"The backing of the bag that gives its nice shape is made of some kind of wood or other hard material or cardboard. I was excited to get a ""man purse"" to carry my cell phones instead of attaching them to my belt. I placed the phones and tried to close the snap button but the backing broke. It cracked. I didn't even use the bag yet and the backing cracked in half. The backing could not even withstand pressure applied to close the snap buttons. What a major disappointment. They couldn't make it out of something less brittle? Useless."
5,Solid Messenger Bag,"I like this bag a lot. It is durable and the size is perfect for me. It wouldn't really fit and textbooks, but I'm an english major, and it definitely fits any novel-sized books with ease. Though the bag is small, it has a surprising amount of storage. I usually hold my Kindle fire, an art notebook, a package of art pens, art pencils, erasers, my ipod, and a book, and there is still a decent amount of space left in it. I've actually never really run into a situation where it didn't have enough space. If you wanted to, you could probably fit a textbook in there, but I don't think I would recommend it; though the bag is durable, constant textbook storage might cause some wear. Overall though, it's great, and it fits everything I need without looking or feeling big and cumbersome."
3,Looks alright but poorly made,"I bought this bag for my boyfriend to use when we travel.It's a little larger than I anticipated it to be, and the push buttons on the front are really hard to button. I mean you really have to press to get them to close.And it has these wings on the top that fold into the bag. I dont know what these are for, but I ended up tearing them out since they only add the bulkiness.There is also a cardboard sewn inside the bag to keep the bag in shape, but it's too thick and awkward. I think I will remove it and put a thin plastic sheet instead.But the bag was cheap, so overall it's ok. I can sew, so I'll be doing some fixing. It looks decent and my boyfriend likes that it looks like a ""man bag"" :)"
4,Great bag,"I have been carrying this bag for over a year, and it's perfect for what I do. A few mods: removed the hard backing, not needed. Replaced the totally inadequate strap with a wide, after-market camera strap. Double stitched the strap hangers. Then, I fabricated a carrying handle using plastic tubing across the top. Wallet goes into the front pouch along with a clip-on flashlight and a hand sanitizer. Inside, i-Pad, day planer (yeah, I know), credit card case and an assortment of small tools. In the words of the great Joe DiMaggio, (I'm showing my age here) ""I like it. It works for me.""Michael"
2,Not the GI map case,"This is not the old standard issue map case. It's a canvas bag made in that style..sort of. The length and height are about the same, but the width...it opens up to about 4 inches. The quality is fair...the stitching looks pretty solid, but not strong. The strap is pretty thin (just under an inch) with buckles bordering on flimsy. I would not try to carry anything too heavy in this bag.If you want a bag to carry documents or an ipad or some such, this will probably be too big to be convenient. The bag expands to a four inch width, so the contents are unlikely to be held securely. Filling it to capacity with books or papers feels like it would break the bag...the contents would be too heavy."
3,You get what you pay for,Not a great item but not terrible. The rigid back is really rigid. Not a bag I will use much and most likely not at all when out.
2,George Burns - that's all,"I have seen George in action a couple of times on the box and this DVD does him no justice. I tried very hard to have a laugh, they were too far in between to keep me interested. - seen better"
2,Poorly inspected Product,This item arrived with clearly visible rust and corrosion. Metal products usually arrive coated in a light oil and wrapped in a light plastic to prevent this type of thing. This item arrived unwrapped and un-oiled. Sincw there was nothing impeding thier vision I believe that they did not inspect the item before it was sent or they just did not care enough to do right by thier customers. I will not order from them again.
4,King Kong vs. Godzilla is an action - packed video!,"King Kong vs. Godzilla gives off great special effects! I enjoyed watching it.Toho made two versions of King Kong vs. Godzilla. American version King Kong won the big fight, but in the Japanese tape Godzilla took the trophy!"
3,Better than i remember...,"Gosh I started collecting Godzilla DVDs realizing that it'll be coming to an end. I bought this DVD used. They just don't carry them new in the stores anymore. Ironically I got a good price on it and found the movie to be better than i remember.I think it has to do with the Bruce Lee movie era, and the fact that the production level is not bad. Universal Studios must've had a part in this Toho production.Of course we collectors will buy all the movies eventually. But this movie was better than the Son of Godzilla movie?"
4,"Good movie, good print, why not letterboxed?","One of the better Godzilla movies of the 'first' series, with a great G-suit (although Kong's is pretty motheaten looking), some pretty exciting fight scenes, and a fairly interesting plot. Contrary to myth (according to Japanese sci-fi expert Stuart Galbraith) Godzilla did NOT win in the Japanese version. Although this GoodTimes DVD boasts one of the best prints of this movie I have ever seen, they did not bother to provide the widescreen version on disc, what a waste!!"
4,WATCH IT FOR GODS SAKE!,"Trust me, see this movie. It's the classic battle. Afer years of betting on who would win, pull out your dollar bills and pray! The only thing that stunk was that it ended in a draw."
3,"good movie, but not one of the best godzilla movies","Anyone that watches Godzilla and King Kong movies should notice the major problem with this film. Godzilla is supposed to be as tall as a 30 story building. King Kong is supposed to be as tall as a house. The two monsters shouldn't have been put into the same film. Although it is a classic monster movie and it is a good film, I do not understand why they had to put both of them into the same movie. They should have called the gorilla something else. Another problem in the film is the fact that Godzilla can be hurt by electricity. It wasnt that way in any other Godzilla films! What are these people smoking?"
3,A great film butchered.,"Those insidious American distributors strike once again! This film was an INTENTIONALLY funny satire of rampant capitalistic greed in its original version. What we have here is a film that comes across as just plain stupid. Scenes with American ""actors"" were added, other scenes were either shuffled or deleted, and the vast majority of the score was removed and replaced by stock music from such films as Creature From the Black Lagoon. What remains is still entertaining, though in a more juvenile fashion. This is a good, entertaining film that will no doubt take older viewers back to his/her childhood. Perhaps, one day, the original Japanese version will be commercially available in the US."
3,"Enjoyable silliness ,but an insipid looking kong","One of the most popular of the original godzilla films in its home country, this is a enjoyable but silly film. In part it is a satire of the genre, but whatever the film was trying to do is forgotten as soon as Kong comes on screen. Effects supervisor Tsuburya (not the correct spelling,sorry)created many fine effects in his life,but this was not one of them. He managed to create one of the most god awful monsters in film history!A hysterical shaggy ape, worse than any seen in the most slipshod hollywood serials. Sadly, he did no better when he returned to Kong a few years later with King Kong Escapes.Still, the movie IS enjoyable, with a sort of all star wrestling final battle.However,other films in the series are better. see the original film, Godzilla vs the Thing, Destroy all monsters or any of the new series from Biolante through Destroyer (1989-1995)"
2,ok movie.. but that kong suit is ghastly!,"A fun film in some ways. But the fun stops and the laughter begins as soon as kong shows up. This is the WORST suit I have ever seen and a truly revolting attempt at a Special effect. more like un-special effects! This has to be the reason the american Godzilla was so bad, It was revenge for this mess!"
1,junnkkk,"Why would someone buy this pan & scan trash? do yourself a favor and recycle it!! The igonorance of some of these companies is overwhelming. This isn't the '80's any more, is it? Boycott rip-offs like this!"
3,I'LL KEEP THE TITLE TH SAME,iT IS AN INTERESTING MOVIE BECAUSE THIS TIME GODZILLA IS NOT FIGHTING A MONSTER HE'S FIGHTING A BIG GORILLA AND THEY BOTH ARE GOOD THEY ARE NOT BAD.
1,Bloody Awful!,"You've got to be kidding me! I was so excited to get King Kong vs. Godzilla, and when I watched it, it was horrible. First of all, I rented King Kong vs. Godzilla in Japanese for 2 days, and it was bad, but this was absolutley WORSE! Scenes were cut out, King Kong's suit was terrible, Godzilla's suit was a reptilian design and terrible, there were some clay fighting, and Godzilla kept clapping his hands! IT WAS AWFUL!! This film, in my opinion, is the worse film of the 60's, with Godzilla's Revenge being the second worse, and Godzilla vs. Mothra being the third worse. GOSH, this movie was terrible!"
1,What were they thinking?!!!,This was the most ridiculous movie I have ever seen! We bought it a few years ago thinking we were going to see what was on the cover.Witch was an image of King Kong from the 1976 version. Witch not to mention was a much better movie.But all Kong was in this film was a guy in a sick fitted monkey outfit.I dont really think it is even worth mentioning.It was a total diapointment I think an insult to the original.Try the 1976 verrsion.
4,The only thing i did not like was that furball monkey!!!,The monkeys at it again!!! Godzilla is the only monster to ever get beaten by a stupid old monkey. Godzilla is good in this one (not as good as godzilla and mothra: the battle for earth).END
3,The Battle of the Century!!!,The giant ape of Faro Island and the nuclear kid on the block have collided in the clash of the century.
5,AWESOME,Godzilla is one thing my father and I can agree on. we can both sit down and just have a godzilla fest for hours because it is something we have both grown up loving. This is just another giant green classic.
3,Rockem sockem goliaths,King Kong and Godzilla meet for the first time in this film about man once again messing around and exploiting the earth's stuff. One side tries to exploit King Kong and the other side's use of atomic power awakens Godzilla. The two meet and they fight destroying all in their wake. What has science done?
2,kk vsgzilla,the dvd would freeze up at several parts of the movie which was annoying. the only way to get the movie to start again is to rewind and play it again several times until it ran or to ff past the scene that the dvd was stuck on.not great quality
3,Twice the terror,In the beggining 2 men accidentley released Godzilla from the ice berg.After 2 Japense men go to mondo island and capture a god named king kong and he fights a octapus named oadako and it retreats.
3,Bring on the kink!,"Now this is one pretty kinky tape. Lots of kink. With the latest Godzilla hype with Anthony Michael Hall, it's good to finally have a director come out and remind us of the kink that lies in the hearts of all nuclear-created lizards of mass destruction. END END"
3,Monster cinema's biggest slugfest!,"Although just about all of the Godzilla flicks have their cheesy charm, I like this one the best. I mean, let's face it: this battle was just plain destined to happen! Monster cinema's two (literally) biggest legends dukin' it out, with the fate of Tokyo's property insurance premiums hangin' in the balance! Yessiree, you'd better be hidin' those scale models, `cuz it's throwdown time! Featurin' all of those not-so-special effects you've come to know & love from classic Japanese monster flicks, as well as those ridiculously cheesy (yet amusing) English dubs!What more could a G-fan ask for?`Late"
4,Good Memories,Watching this brought back great memories of me watching it with my Dad and it was very enjoyable to now watch it with my grandchildren!
3,Begging For A (Rematch) Remake!,"As A Child Growing Up, I Was As Big A Science Fiction Fan As There Could Be! My Favorites Were Always The ""Giant Monster"" Flicks That Would Come On, Mainly On Saturdays. At That Time, I Was At The Mercy Of The TV Programmers(As Most Of Us Were, Who Are Of A Certain Age). But Now I Have Most Of These Movies On DVD And That Definitely Includes ""GODZILLA V. KING KONG."" The DVD Transfer Is Good, Almost To Good, As You Can Clearly See Some Of The Wires And Props. But Thats Minor, I Thoroughly Enjoyed This As Much As I Did Forty Years Ago!Given The Major Advances In Special Effects, Since Then, I Wish They Would Remake These Movies Using Today's Technologies. I Guarantee There's A Big Enough Audience, Out There, To Justify It,"
3,King Kong vs Godzilla,My grandchildren and I have really enjoyed watching this dvd since receiving it a few weeks ago. I would buy it again.
2,Cheesy even for a Godzilla movie.,"(previous entry ""godzilla raids again"", Summary: It's America versus Japan as Godzilla and King Kong meet in a fiery fight to the finish.The only thing saving this one from the one star rating is the monsters themselves. The human characters are boring and the dialogue and script are awful. Worst in the series.Next is ""Godzilla Vs. Mothra""."
2,An INSULT to the Godzilla Series!!!!,"This movie is so bad that it only gets two stars because the films is so rotten its enjoyable to watch just to get a good laugh at! So if your a science fiction lover searching for a serious sci-fi film look somewhere else. However if you are a B-movie lover searching for a good laugh this fil is for you. Natives dance and sing with crafty feathers on their hats, King Kong and Godzilla make stupid wreseler moves and girls scream in terror as the world`s two most famous monsters duke it out. It is very hard to believe this made the most money of any Godzilla film. The only big credit I give this movie is the Kong vs. giant octopus scene`s claymation and that without its big budget there wouldn`t be any Godzilla series. King Kong acts more like Bongo the monkey wonder chimp."
4,From TOHO: UNCUT! LETTERBOXED! IN JAPANESE! EXTRAS!,"OH yes, thanks NOT to Amazon, but to the web auctioneers, it is possible to own the TOHO DVD/VHS of this classic AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED: uncut, letterboxed, in stereo, and in Japanese with NO annoying dubbing, American footage or even subtitles to worry about. Actually the only sloppy dialog is in the scenes on the sub and in the Chinook helicopter, where some Americans get their voices overdubbed! Fill in your own dialog translations for the little ones a'la MST3K if you feel the need; my granddaughters aged 5 & 6 followed the plot perfectly with just a few imbellishments from Gramps. Believe me, they WILL say NO! to drugs!"
5,Kingu Kongu tai Gojira,"This is one good film, and it has Godzilla against another famous monster King Kong!Kaiju Movies Rule!"
2,The Worst Special Effects aver,"The reason why thise film has bad effects because that, when the the actors are up close to King Kong, there bodies are blues and it looks like someone took a picture of the actor and pasted it on another piece of film with King Kong. The only thing good in this movie is story line and Godzilla's suite, this suite is realistic, more realistic than godzilla vs. Mothra. You will like the ending, and the japanese version is that Godzilla wins and King Kong dies. The Americanized version which is dubbed has King kong live."
2,Not as good...,"This movie came to my attention when I was 12 years old, and it was the first time I ever saw Godzilla in my life. It was well paced, the FX were good for their time, and it was action packed. However, since then I have had an opportunity to find a VHS copy of the Original Japanese Release with English subtitles (In Widescreen). It was changed for American Audiences. I enjoyed this version much better. There was more character development, better pacing, and a much more enjoyable movie all around. I feel that imports on DVD should have the option of presenting the ORIGINAL theatrical version, with subtitles as an option. I believe American Audiences would have a better time with them."
3,"Good movie, Bad CD","I got this DVD for Christmas. While the movie is still really fun to watch, the actual quality of the DVD was pretty much the same as VHS. So, save some money, and this on tape. Your not missing much."
3,Kong vs The Champ!,"I thought that this movie was a really kool monster arena. Godzilla gets loose in Japan heading on a rampage. So the Japanese go to get another monster they heard about on an island in the South Pacific Ocean. So they bring the monster back not knowing the damage it will do so they set both of these monsters up. The Japanese think there getting rid of two horrible monsters, but their really heading into great danger. I rated this movie 3 stars because its a fight between the two most popular giant monsters."
5,ONE OF THE CHAMPIONS111,"I LOVE GODZILLIA!!!! KING KONG IS GOOD BUT GODZILLIA IS THE BEST AND WHEN THEY PLACED THESE 2 TO BOX AND GO AT IT..MAN!!!!! KING KONG HAD A VERSION THAT WAS ON TV, I CANT FIND! IT WOULD VIEW ON THE 3:00 EVENING THEATER ON TV A LONG TIME AGO,ALL I CAN REMEMBER IS SOME GIRL YELLING TO HIM..""KONG!!!..STOP THE SHIP!!..STOP THE SHIP KONG,AND KONG DID,HE RAN THROUGH THE WATER. IN THIS FLICK,THEY GAVE KONG WINE!! THEY SONG A SONG ABOUT HIM AS THYEY SANG. SO THEY COULD TIE HIM DOWN AFTER GETTING HIM DRUNK!..DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THIS OR KNOW WHERE I CAN GET THIS PARTICULAR VERSION?.. AS FOR THIS ONE IT IS A BIG CLASSIC!"
2,Godzilla vs King Kong,"The title pretty much says the movie. A battle between a 150 foot tall reptile and a 135 foot tall Gorilla. Seriously though, I could have expected much better battle skill from Godzilla. I mean, Godzilla has an Atomic ray and King Kong just has his strength. But it seems that they gave King Kong the power to get stronger by electricity. Anyway, Godzilla`s Atomic ray could have easily stoped King Kong. Trust me, if Godzilla used his Atomic ray that much, King Kong would be dead. In the end, the monsters roll off a cliff and into the water. After a landslide, King Kong surfaces and swims to his home on Faro island. I really think that King Kong looks ouite bad in this movie. And I would imagine that in the end, Godzilla could just pull that dumb, overgrown gorilla underwater and fry him. But once I laid these commets aside the movie was ouite enjoyable."
2,Just get clear straps separately.,"Not as comfortable as advertised. This is a below par product by Lily of France. Construction seams a bit cheap. Amazon's packaging was poor. They should put some kind of padding for the undergarments instead of tossing them in with everything else. Or place in separate smaller box. Mine came with one cup wrinkled. There were no manufacturer tags on the bra though? The underwire was still in shape so decided it was not worth the shipping to return a 12.44 product. No original product tags so I wasn't sure if it was a used and returned product. Just in case, washed out the product and that also helped with the wrinkled padding."
4,"""Sea Hunt"" on Steroids","If you are a SEA HUNT fan this is an excellent addition to your collection.A little known about Lloyd Bridges flick, the plot is fairly predictable, as were most of the SEA HUNT episodes.The ""classic"" nature of the parachute gear used is a reason in itself to view this movie.It (almost) makes me sorry I sold my UT-15 many moons ago..."
5,Great!,"This is one of the best CDs. Alabina's singing is fast paced and when you hear the songs, you just want to get up and dance. She's got a wonderful strong voice. This CD includes a few songs that were previously released and are included in one of her other CDs. The rhythm, the language, the sound...creates this mood elevating experience! This CD also includes her singing in Hebrew (track #10--Eshebo). I've heard this song a little differently, but her version is excellent too! #15 is new and it is all in Spanish. Anyway, its great, you'll probably enjoy it!"
4,"Great, but strong accent!","I lovelovelovelovelove Alabina. The only thing is that Ishtar has a very bad Arabic accent. I'm Lebanese and I know all the originals for these songs, and I can tell she is prononcing her words wrong. Still, it is veryvery good and i love that Ishtar sings in so many languages. Alabina is wonderful."
5,This CD is awesome,I think this CD is awesome and i wuld recommend this CD to everyone If u liked the album 1 and album 2 you'll love this one. Its so good i can't stop listening to it. Buy iy. Its worth it
3,Good toy,I got this yesterday it was fun but alittle hard. I went to play it today and it whould not work it might just need cleaning but the thig is brand new.
5,A book that must be read by all fans of space exploration.,"A work of fiction written as a guide and manual for a workable base on the moon. The book is an easy read with many wonderful pictures, very similar to the Dinotopia series of books. It will make you want to go to the moon yourself."
1,I dislike this book,"I must say, I did not like this book. It was a little child like and quite boring. I would recomend it only to the true space fanatic."
4,good enough,The book cover was a little different from the product picture. One I received was blue instead of white.
2,"Flimsy, Poorly Made & Silly Case Design","Oh, Belkin how you have lost your way. I bought this knowing that the plastic case was silly and excessively designed. However, when I got it I was stunned to see how cheap it felt in my hand. The case is thin. The finish is straight of the 1990's ""Look! If we add sparkles it kinda looks like metal!"" Your own silk-screened name rubs off within months.It works. That's fine. But why make something so cheap and ugly?"
4,Wonderful book on Hungarian food and food culture,"This is a terrific book of authentic hungarian cuisine, with customary use of lots of Paprika and Capsicums. The recipes are simple and tasty and I have made many dinner parties conisting of a porkolt, paprikash and tokany with a vegetable soup and sweets to finish off, all of which can be found in this neat little book. Nothing is overly complex and the instructions are clear and concise.Some recipes however either do not have(like the goulash) or use only minimal Paprika. Usually for the Paprikash and some other recipes, I add signifcantly more than required to make sure it is not just a glorified stroganoff. Other than this small gripe it is a wonderful book with great information, pretty pictures and well tested recipes, just like other books in this series."
5,Good Book Bad sellers!!!!,"I love this book and give it 5 stars and I do alot of shopping here on Amazon. But I am outraged at the sellers that have posted their new/used books at ridiculous prices! I unfortunately had to purchase this book at Barnes and Noble because Amazon did not have it and I just happened to look at the ""available from these sellers"" list.... there is a person selling this book for over $300! The book cost $22 retail! I paid $19.95 for it. I hope that Amazon customers stay loyal to this website but please be careful of ""these other sellers"" who are just looking to rip you off!"
3,Taste of Hungary,"The book is full of interesting history. The recipes are a bit disappointing in that there are not many, and those that are included are really day-to-day recipes and nothing gastronomical. If you are loooking for home style regional food, this would be a great book to start."
3,"Good value, unremarkable new content","As a longtime fan of the Matador Records roster, I already had most of the great 'Greatest Hits 1999-2004' tracks on Disc 1. I was generally disappointed with the 'Unreleased Tracks/Rarities 1999-2004' material on Disc 2. This set also contains 12 videos on a third disc which I watched once.This 2 CD + 1 DVD set at a single disc price is an excellent value. Like the recent 3 CD Merge compilation, this would make a good gift and is worth 5 stars for new fans. However, the subpar new material makes it inessential for fans already familiar with Matador's output from the last five years."
3,It was ok....,"I liked less the half of the songs on this CD, but still enjoyed it.. I recommend the CD to Raphael fans..."
3,"Great songs, OK singer","Let me say that the songs and the arrangements are great . But, half way through the CD it suddenly hit me who this singer sounds like. He sounds just like Bert Larr as the lion in the movie ""The Wizard Of Oz"". He has the same sound at the end of many lines and phrases as Bert had in the famous ""If I were king of the forest"" routine in the film. This became a little disconcerting and I just was not able to listen to any longer. I have been a great fan of Julio Iglesias and Luis Miguel for some time. This singer ""rafael"" just does not compare to these and other great Spanish singers."
3,"Even on a bad day, Python shines","Matching Tie And Handkerchief is easily the weakest of the Monty Python studio LPs, though of course that still makes it pretty good.While some sketches fall flat (the ""Great Actors"" sketch, for instance, is well-researched but fails to include any actual jokes), and others drag on too long (""Cheeseshop""), there is some excellent silliness to make up for the odd dull patch. In particular, the ""Novel Writing"" sketch is a superb skit on sports commentary, the sheer exuberance of the performance makes ""Bruces"" a delight, and ""Background To History"" is built around some genuinely catchy songs from Neil Innes.It's hard to shake off the feeling that the double-groove on the original LP was the album's best gag, but despite that, and despite a few frankly rubbish sketches, this is still a must-have for the Python fan."
4,The double grooves on Side Two WAS a good gimmick!,"""I think all right-thinking people in this country are sick and tired of being told that ordinary, decent people are fed in this country with being sick and tired."" For some reason, I just love the way Graham Chapman's incredibly long-winded, mock-conservative bit of radio double-talk starts off this album. And while ""Matching Tie..."" is not as consistently hilarious as say ""Monty Python's Previous Record"", it does have it's moments. Highlights include ""Cheese Shop"", ""Oscar Wilde and Friends"" and ""Bruces"", but you'll find more witty, bizarre, and genuinely funny stuff all over ""Matching Tie and Handkerchief""."
2,It's OK,"I bought it and it worked OK. I loved at first... until I wore it with a long sleve shirt which was BLACK.The watch turned gray and it never got rid of it. I tried cleaning it with soap, alcohol, acetone... you name it!I gave it to my niece to play with. It looked dirty."
3,Black Widow - 'III' (Repertoire),"Originally released in 1972, this was Black Widow's third lp. Best described as early '70's doom metal / hard rock. See my review of their 'Come To The Sabbat' 2-CD Anthology. Best cuts here are the eleven-minute / three part epic ""The Battle"" which I noticed had several moods as well as changes in tempo, ""King of Hearts"" and the well-written ""Old Man"". Line-up: Kip Trevor - guitar & lead vocals, Geoff Griffith - bass & vocals, John Culley - acoustic guitar & vocals, Zoot Taylor - keyboards & organ, Romeo Challenger - drums and Clive Jones - flute & sax. Should appeal to most open-minded fans of Uriah Heep, Sabbath, Atomic Rooster and possibly Iron Butterfly or even Argent. Not their best work, but decent."
5,great stuff,"one of my favorite bands;pounding riffs,good old fashioned hard sound features this 80' european hard rock performance.tokyo blade,old savatage alike,heavy sound,unique voice,the whole package for 80' metal lovers.unfortunately this is not their best record;the first one which was released in the late 80's,and it is called ""streetfigther"",is a lot better-i think.too bad that it is impossible to track it down in the states.if anybody has a word on its availability,pls,pls,let me know!!! thanx :)"
2,Extraordinary Life - Very Ordinary Biography,"Donna Summer is an exceptional singer and songwriter, but book author? No. So much is missing from this book that it would take me days to list it all. For people who care about the creative process of putting her career together, keeping it afloat, and the progress she's made as an artist, it certainly leaves you wanting."
2,A major diappointment,"What a missed opportunity this book has turned out to be! Although it contains a few (not many) insights into Donna's personal life and beliefs, fans hoping for an examination of her music, creative processes, and working relationships with her collaborators like Giorgio Moroder, will find virtually nothing to satisfy their curiosity. Much of her career, the hits, the good and bad times and the controversies, are only touched on lightly or not even mentioned. With masses of pictures filling out the sparse 246 pages or so, the content of this book is so light I feared it would fly away if I wasn't holding on to it! I guess this is all Donna wants her fans to know about her, but frankly, it just isn't interesting reading. Hopefully some other biographer will write a more informative book about Donna and her music some day."
2,what about the website?,"I rushed out and bought this book, since I am a very avid fan of Donna Summer. There is simply no finer voice in the pop music world. However, for those of us who are drawn to her musically, this book is sorely lacking in detail. I enjoyed the insights into her personal life, but I would have loved to have read about her creative process, her experience with the various producers she's worked with, and how she's managed to keep her audience interested over a 28 year career span. [] Also, the website mentioned on the inside back cover flap is still under construction....what gives? Your fans deserve better, Donna!"
5,donna summer the journey ordinary girl,"LOVE LOVE LOVE DONNA SUMMER....HER MUSIC THAT IS!There are many reviewers of the book by many loving fans, love it & hate it. Fans wanted more but this is the only information they 'get' from their QUEEN.However at the end of the day, this is what Miss Summer wanted to write and yes I agreed with some reviewers, there are a lot that she could write about and tell her fans. Her researchers surely have provided enough information but that's about it! Just a pile of papers and link perhaps for her and Marc Eliot to 'just' view them. Still what is the problem? The book is on sale we buy it. Let's just enjoy it.This autobiography was produced nicely. The book included many lovely photos, a bit of her 'life' tales... and her musical journey."
2,R U Kidding!!!,"Let me begin by saying I've only gotten through half of this book. Whether reading about how she was supposedly shot, almost attempted suicide, was the victim of domestic violence or was the star witness who singlehandledly served justice i found it all to be unbelievable. I make this statement simply because whenever there was someone who could attest to the statement Ms. Summer openly states that she has conveniently changed the names to protect them or they are all dead. She doesn't develop the story line to even begin to explain the affairs and only alludes to them seemingly well after they've begun. Each chapter leaves me scratching my head. I certainly expect that hopefully with each chapter, the book will somehow pick up but at this point i'm totally disappointed. In fairness to the Ms. Summer I hope at some point she chooses to be open about her experiences and give her fans a true look at her life. If you don't want to tell the story don't write the book."
3,Lack of cd room,book doesn't have its cd room. all ather volumes of the american way has a cd room to help the learn. This one doent have its own.
5,Working Class has lots of class,"Pete Anderson's initial solo album from Little Dog Records includes 11 songs, a mixture of originals and cover tunes. The title track, Working Class, would fit well in today's political climate, with jobs being shipped overseas at an alarming rate; the intrumental of Our Day Will Come, showcases the guitar talents of Mr. Anderson, quite nicely. Some of my other favorites are the musician's lament, What About Me and Blue Hour, which also prove Anderson has a great bluesy voice to go along with that awesome guitar work. Additional musicians on the album include Taras Prodaniuk, Skip Edwards and Jim E. Christie."
5,"Great music, this last project album","This was the last (of the 10) album(s) of The Alan Parsons Project, with both Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson. Later on, some of the songs became part of Woolfson's Gaudi musical, which ran successfully at Aachen, Alsdorf and Cologne, Germany and which was televised twice in German TV (ZDF). The finale (or epilog) of the musical, featuring La Sagrada Familia, is one of most impressive finales I have ever seen, only comparable with the Vienna version of Les Miserables. Last year I had the privilege to listen to La Sagrada Familia during a special Night of the Proms Open Air Concert at Saarbruecken, with John Miles as lead singer, Alan Parsons and his group, and a huge choir. I am looking forward to my first visit to Barcelona next July to see some of Gaudi's wonderful architecture."
3,The force of APP was waning,"By the time this CD came out in the late 1980s, the Parsons-Woolfson connection appeared to be waning. Though this is CD is full of interesting tracks, there were few songs that stood alone above the rest of the stuff out there. The best thing about this project is the commitment to the concept at hand -- La Sagrada Familia, and its story."
3,"Weak theme, not enough treatment","Woolfson didn't do this theme justice--it appears he was either not that interested or just didn't have enough ideas to produce an entire album. Sure, people like a number of individual songs but the whole album is simply lacking in power and cohesiveness. I consider this to be the weakest of all Project and post-Project albums. However, it's still better than most stuff out there, sounds absolutely fantastic (it's one of the first all digital recordings), and many of the songs are staples of the live shows."
4,Struck me as a standard sci-fi fare.,"I admit to enjoying this book, once the things started happening, anyway, but I could not quite bring myself to see the originality."
3,One of her weaker works,"In Falling Free Bujold fails to create characters as complex as Aral, Cordelia, or Miles. The story feels very plot oriented, with hard science fiction tendancies. The story distance in time from Miles days makes it an unimportant novel in regards to her other novels. The book ends leaving one waiting for a sequel. Maybe a second story would make this one feel more complete."
4,No Vorkosigan -- Set Earlier in Same Universe,"Takes place in the Vorkosigan universe -- no Miles, no planet Vorr, but still a humanizing and humbling story about quaddies -- people genetically engineering to work better in space. They have four hands instead of two hands and two legs, and the company which created them considers them property and not people. I still enjoyed the story of their independence, but be careful if you expect more of Miles or his family -- not in this novel (200 years too early).I think it's very misleading to put 'Miles Vorkosigan Adventures' on the classification of this story. It's a good enough story that it can stand on it's own merit."
4,Lighter reading than most of the Vorkosigan saga,"Falling Free is an enjoyable enough book but I agree with the reviewers who feel it compares unfavorably to a lot of the more core Vorkosigan books. It's definitely fluffier, and in comparison to many of Miles' adventures where the twists and turns are consistently (and refreshingly) surprising, it's more formulaic and easier to predict. There is less introspective moral and ethical musing, fewer of the deeply woven and deeply emotional threads regarding personal honor and guilt. The characters are cameo quality, not the intensely developed people who populate much of Miles' world. Still, I think it suffers mostly by comparison with Bujold's other, truly excellent books; it's certainly better than a lot of science fiction on the shelves, and worth reading as a light space opera romp. Maybe after a more intense novel like the astoundingly good Mirror Dance, for a breather, with some popcorn."
4,More music would be nice.,"This is a fine biography, but like most biographys of artists it has too little of the artists work and too much focus on the people around the artist.And in the ""You can't depend on Google"" department, the song ""Time After Time"" that Miles recorded is credited in the Amazon review to Cyndi Lauper. She did write a song with that title, but ""Time After Time"" is a jazz standard written by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne that first appeared in the 1947 movie ""It Happened in Brooklyn"", long before Ms Lauper was born."
1,Uncomplete,"I do understand what a documentary really is, but why these guys give us just a couple of SECONDS of the vintage video tape material. The classic quintet; the first shows with Chick Corea and Keith Jarret; the Charlie Parker period...everything is there but absolutely and dramatically abridged (not even one single track is shown complete). I don't like this DVD."
2,the miles davis story,"Too much talking, too little music. This documentary is ok as an introduction to Miles Davis. But the commentator is interrupting when the music is pumping, which is f..... annoying. There is still a desperate need for a Miles Davis DVD about the period between 1969-75. Without all the talking. Just pure music without interruption.Andreas Jorgensen"
3,A good album but misses the PDP standard,I'm a huge PDP fan so of course I was excited to hear their most recent offering. After hearing some of these songs live I was somewhat disappointed by the album. It's still pretty good but lacks the energy of its predecessors. It's a good album if you just wanna chill out and relax although at times - it's dangerously close to something you'd hear in an elevator.
2,Music and the Inhaler!,"The movie has been made in Europe. It has good locales. There is evidence of fine taste for paintings. A. R. Rehman's music is good, but not great. Anil Kapoor comes out as competent. The story is quite thin and the narration is unexciting. Boman Irani gives an entertaining performance. Zayed Khan, Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif et al, disappoint.The story is about a rich father in London who dictates to his friend and Attorney (Mithun Chakrobarty) how to play out his Will. There are millions in the estate. The ultimate aim is to bring about strong brotherhood among his 3 children from 2 marriages. There is a scheming ""Mama"" (Uncle). And, there is a very little boy. There is a talented singer who has severe asthma.Increasingly, numerology is dictating the spelling of movie titles. However, the story is thin and the movie falls flat, although Subhash Ghai has directed and made this movie."
1,Yavvraaj (2008) Not an original,"The version of the movie Yuvvraaj that I bought turned out not to be an original copy as advertised. This movie turned out to be 24 minutes shorter than the original released DVD. Major scenes were edited out of the movie, and what was left was a seriously butchered version.I have a copy of the original released DVD, and it is 180 minutes long, and quite entertaining. Salman Khan did a great job portraying the dislikable character, Deven. He redeems himself before the movie ends, but without the missing scenes, the movie really falls flat.I advise anyone to not purchase the shortened and edited version of Yuvvraaj, because now it is a waste of time. Instead of returning the movie, I tossed it in the waste bin."
4,Yep.........,"I must say this video is hot. Very sexy women. Most are naturally endowed and sensuous. This is almost a 5. Big breasted lusty women, small petite great body, sexy women. Jana is p-h-i-n-e fine. I can find nothing wrong with this video. I didn't give it a 5 because one of the models wasn't that good to look at. This is one for your collection."
2,Better if it was limited to the Soundtrack,"Indeed, when this recording first appeared as a vinyl record album, it was the only source for sound clips from the movie. Some of the more famous HOLY GRAIL bits are on this CD, but the recording is cluttered with other superfluous routines and supposedly funny commentary. This CD would be much better if it contained the whole movie soundtrack as Python fans need no explaination of what is going on at any given moment in the recording. If you buy this CD, be prepared to skip the unrelated comic bits to get to the pure GRAIL dialogue."
5,"We really like Tums, but had never tried ...","We really like Tums, but had never tried the extra strength. I feel they do work better/faster than the regular Tums. I also really like the spearmint flavor. I'd recommend these to everyone."
5,loved this ear muffs,"it's very small and handy, love it how i can keep it with all my other shooting items cause of the space it saves. my friends ear muffs from big 5 are extremely large and gets in the way, though they have a better sound guard but not by to much."
4,works well,"I have used these muffs for a weekend pistol training and wore them for hours at a time. They seem to feel a little tight but a cushioned well and never got uncomfortable even after a few hours of wear. I also have glasses and this was not a problem. The level of hearing protection is great. Great price and they do what they are supposed to do. I will be ordering a couple more of these. I gave it 4 and not 5 stars ONLY because it seems to be a thin hard plastic and I can't imagine they will last for years without breaking, but at this price I'll order a few and rotate them."
5,Best CHEAP muffs on the market,"Comfortable, easy to fold up, light to carry. These are identical to others for sale on Amazon at a higher price (Pyramax for example), so save your money and buy these if you are looking for the cheapest muffs for occasional use."
2,Ha these....,"Well, I think after a few months of use I was at the range and found them falling appart. I tried putting them together but since it has already broken appart, its noise reduction wasn't there anymore. So basically, as soon as I started shooting 9mm the noise was able to bounce back into me and my ears were ringing.So I recommend against buying these if you want them to last."
5,Good deal,"Nice, affordable, compact, good sound reduction outdoors- I like to double up indoors with these (inner ear surefire's) plus these on top."
3,Entertaining if in the Right Mood,"This is not really a book to sit and read straight through. Its one to put on the side table or on the edge of the bathtub and read a little at a time. Its basically Miss Manners re-written for the 2002 single career girl. For some people its advice will just be common sense and what they have already learned from their mothers and from experience. For others, it contains a good range of social and work environment etiquette that is sadly lacking these days. I was a little taken in by the cover and title and unfortunately did not find it as amusing as I thought it might have been. However, I did still find it quite readable."
1,What Decorum?,"I never knew before this that decorum consisted of being tawdry and perhaps a bit trashy in some regards. Go figure. Some portions can be entertaining, but it definitely lacks in discussing the art of respecting yourself, and, in turn, gaining the respect of others."
2,not so fabulous,"I think the Fabulous Girls are not so fabulous, as their book is rather a bore. There are other books on the topic that are more creative with the same material, using some humor and wit to liven things up. My recommendation is to look elsewhere."
3,Fun Read,"This book was one of the first etiquette/decorum books I read. If you are seeking to scratch the surface of etiquette in the 21st Century and have a little laugh while reading...this is the book for you. If you're looking to delve deeper into the halls of the decorum of a lady, you may want to look further."
1,Decorum a HUGE Misnomer,"I don't know why I thought this book would be about behaving oneself! It's actually a treatise on how to misbehave in the most socially acceptable way. There isn't ANY useful information on manners or decorum as far as I could see. I feel like I wasted my money. The cover illustration is very cute, but don't let it fool you!"
3,Decorum for Sex?,"My sister sent me this book, and maybe it's written cutesy, and looks cutesy, but as a college student, there's not a lot I can use. I agree with the reviewer who said it was crass. There was too much about sex etiquette, and a real classy woman would be more concerned with everything in a relationship that comes before the sex. I'd rather be a classy woman, an etiquette chick, a belle, a lady, whatever than be a so-called fabulous girl."
4,Almost Fabulous,"Women have always had a hard time in the career climb. This book lets women know how to laugh at ourselves and gives good advice on how to handle our mistakes gracefully, and hopefully how to avoid them in the future. While sex may still be a touchy subject even today, I rather liked how frank the authors were about handling the one-night fling, a martial mating, and boy toy mistakes. Granted not every woman does all of these things, some may do all, but instead of being embarrassed and depressed or (worse yet) rude about the situation, why not elegantly brush yourself off and keep going forward through life? Life is meant to be enjoyed and the FG's encourage everyone to do so. Remember though to take it all in with a grain of salt. For a different perspective, I would recommend THE RULES (Ellen Fein, Sherrie Schneider) and THE GIRL'S GUIDE TO POWER AND SUCCESS(Susan Wilson Solovic)."
1,Waste of Money,This book was a total waste of money. You can find more interesting and useful information in an issue of Marie Claire or Allure. Very disappointing.
3,Trying a bit too hard,"The authors start out well with a description of 9-to-5 drudgery and how to handle it. Just as they introduce other characters you begin to think things will get interesting. This is more than your typical how-to-be-polite guide, as there is a narrative that almost seems to go somewhere. However this unusal trick is ruined by self-concious, pretentious ""kicky"" language. Almost every male character is referred to as ""Bingo"", which grows tired after the first chapter.I collect ettiquitte books and didn't mind spending the money to have this one in my collection, if only for the unique approach. If you're looking for a reliable reference I'd look elsewhere."
1,so pathetic,"This book doesn't offer much advice at all. In fact, I was so annoyed when the author kept on referring to Mr. Groovy Guy that I honestly wondered why it was ever published. Clearly, the authors could have written a more classy novel that women actually WANT to read."
1,Not worthy of your time or money....,"DON'T buy this book. It's the worst book I've attempted to read in a long time. It's so bad, it's the ONLY book I haven't finished reading in the past five years. I couldn't even get past the second chapter. The so-called 'tips' in this novel are blatantly obvious and sometimes misinformed. I concur with the reader who stated in her review she could get more information out of an issue of Marie Claire. I wasted my money on this book, you shouldn't have to. The bad reviews speak for themselves, do yourself a favor and just keep walking if you see it at the bookstore....."
1,Product dirty and touched up with paint,"Was listed as new, but every item was dirty and most of the pieces were touched up with paint. Obviously this was a used item. Very disappointed as I had to order from elsewhere because I am afraid to reorder from Amazon."
2,Outdated,"How can you sell a book on ANY ""technology"" published 6 YEARS ago for $55.00? I read a friend's version and being in law enforcement found the information, in most cases, archaic.An interesting book for archival value @ $10.95.NOTE: the positive reviews were around the original time of publication.Time for a 2nd edition!"
2,Too vague,"I have to read this book for school and it is too vague, it does touch few interesting points but as I said before it is too vague, I found myself searching in the internet for a better explanation to the points this book mentions.If you turned on your computer today, and are reading this review, perhaps this book will be an insult to your intellect.Perhaps was destined to readers from 20 years ago, it does need to be updated; and a little more clarification, the book should inform you and this book does not accomplish that.Sorry Raymond"
4,Why Al Stewart was omnipresent on the radio 1974-1981,"While no ""Best of"" ever truly captures the essence of a great artist (with the possible exception of ""The Very Best of the Eagles""), this collection comes close. Al Stewart's genius was in writing songs that were intelligent enough to provoke thought and even study but, at the same time, be accessible enough for Top 40 radio. This collection shows that genius in all of its glory.Song after song on this CD is a classic. While not everything is included here (Soho (Needless to Say), Carol, and If It Doesn't Come Naturally, Leave It would have fit in nicely) this is a very good introduction to one of Scotland's finest exports. Although Rhino's recent collection contains more songs and represents nearly everything here, this release does contain two songs (""Delia's Gone"" and ""Nostradamus"", two of my personal favorites) that the Rhino disc does not. If you want a good snapshot of Al Stewart's heyday, this is it."
2,Colour Reproductions disappoint,"The colour reproductions of Morandi's oil Paintings are very disappointing. The prints didn't ""live "" at all and have lost the subtlety of colour that characterises Morandi's work. There is little or no depth to the colour. Morandi's deep toned accents suffer and appear thin. Those marvellous flashes of apricot/orange are maddenly deadened. There is often an overbalance of a greenish ochre in the colour print. The textural quality of Morandi's brushwork is curiously flattened and lifeless.Fortunately the Watercolours, drawings and etchings have not suffered to the same extent: although I cannot believe the grey cast that is given to what must have frequently been a variety of white papers.Good text. Informative photographs but overall a disappointing purchase - especially in NZ dollars."
2,The Reader's Digest Version,"If you have had the opportunity to see the (out-of-print) show catalogue (Giorgio Morandi: [catalogue of] an exhibition of paintings, water-colours, drawings and etchings) this skimpy overview will not only disappoint, it also will not whet your appetite for more of this insightful artist's oeuvre."
1,jackie chan collection 8 film set beware,"I just purchased a copy of the Jackie Chan collection 8 film setI'm not pleased with the way the video looks, why would they compress 4 movieson one of the 2 disks. It looks terrible. With seriousness some of the videos on this set are unbearable to watch. I have a collection of 100's of DVD's + Blue-rays.So I can tell you this is the worst looking DVD quality I've ever seen. They where greedy with this one and used to much compression sacrificing the quality of these great movies. And ruined some great films! If you see Echo Bridge Entertainment on the label of any disk you may buy, then buyer beware! Any serious video buff would notice this particularly when playing back on a large HDTV screen. I've never had a problem with any other movies I own. I will not ever trust Echo Bridge Entertainment again!"
3,Hard of hearing,Our family loves Jackie but some in our family are a little hard of hearing and there are no subtitles.The movies were good but if you need or like subtitle to supplement what you can't hear don't buy this version.
2,Movies,My hubby did'nt care for any of these movies. Maybe the were made too long ago. He does like Jackie Chan usually.
2,Not My Favorite,"I like action movies BUT I do not like films that are dubbed. This package contained films made in Chinese and dubbed in English. If I had known they were not all English, I would not have purchased. There should really be a notice or disclaimer on such films so people know what they are buying."
4,Almost... Perfect,"An almost perfect Jackie Chan movie PackGreat selection of Jackie Chan movies, at a great price. Fifth star is loss due to the loss of quality due to high compression, to fit the movies on so few discs.Still a great bargain, just be ware, sound is slightly soft and not the same edits and cuts of single versions I've seen."
5,Jackie Chan at his best,"This movie pack had all the action, agility, etc. expected, it did not disappoint. I purchased this for my martial artist son. He was well pleased."
5,Great Reader,"I wish I could find more of these books. They give an insight to the Amish way of living (made for Amish schools). My children love reading them and can relate to the love of animals, family, and even the little lessons written into them. I like the very realistic stories about the children in them (yes, there are arguments, jealousies, ""sneaking,"" etc. just like in life) and the ways out of those conflicts. Not all the stories have moral conflicts..some of them are adventurous, exciting, funny, humorous, and enjoyable to read. They are comparable to the McGuffey readers."
2,A lack of commitment,"Like any new book this one contains some interesting stuff. Unfortunately it leaves the impression of being a ""database dump"". This is largely the result of a lack of commitment on the part of the author. Too many lines end with the comment that it requires more testing. One wishes that Pedersen had given more guidance on which alernative looks superior, based on solid analysis. Also, many lines seem to end prematurely, leaving one to wonder how the game in question turned out. Sure, there are more lines here than in NCO, but the lack of assessment leaves the book only slightly more useful."
1,Cheap quality,The bag does not zip closed but rather it buckles which I did not like and the strap to one of the buckles broke within the first week I used it. Overall the bag seems very flimsy to me.
2,Shipped BROKEN!,"Delievery took about a week since it is coming all the way from new york and I am on the west coast. Price is great and I love how it has no brand on the bag. The shoulder straps are very thin. You would think they would make thicker ones. The bag came BROKEN! I was very disappointed but I dont want to deal with the hassle of sending it all the way back and then waiting another week for a new one. That would have been an extra two weeks.Like one person said, one of the buckles in the front was already broke because its so thin and plastic. Ehh I guess I will just have to go to a crafts store and hope they have the right size buckle clip to replace it"
1,Seems nice but it's not.,"One of the plastic clasps broke the first day. After looking at the other clasps closely, it is easy to see they are junk. Other than that it seems OK. However, I would need to fix this and my time is worth more than it will take me to work out getting new clasps. I should return it but I feel a fool for thinking I would get something good for such little money. Spend a little more and get something else."
5,Refreshing take on modern love,"I think a few people here are missing the point that Bridges was attracted to her (in more ways than one) when she was plain...not just after her transformation. This movie was sad/funny/intelligent. With everyone so obsessed these days with physical appearance, I found the twist on their romance to be refreshing."
4,Entertaining Romantic Comedy With Sparkling Performances!,"While the material and the screenplay are lite fluff, the performances are the stars here. Jeff Bridges is hilarious and perfect as the stubborn professor. Barbara Streisand is more than a little self-conscious but her comic touch and diva qualities are used smartly. Lauren Bacall almost steals the show as the emotionless mother. Romantic and sometimes very funny. Formylaic story, but endearing characters and inspired casting make up for it. Streisand refuses to look unattractive in the first half of the movie and that tones down the 'dramatic' elements of the movies; internal and undiscovered beauty, etc. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"
5,Exceptional storyline!,"I'm not a huge Streisand fan, but she brings a transformation to life that we all can relate to on some level. Beau Bridges is amazing--he really connects and his character is likewise very believeable! The story itself is terrific and even believeable! There are many (re)affirming qualities concerning human nature and hope runs rampant in your heart as you watch the characters' relationship grow and develop. It is NOT all that predictable, although it will end as one might hope, with the best for all coming to pass.The only change I'd recommend to the director is to cut the final scene--it goes over the top and becomes too ""Hollywood"" to be credible in the real world. As the film director, I'd freeze the scene with the music playing in the background and let the credits roll--your imagination can create a better and more personal reality! I hope you enjoy the movie and that you are a better person because of it. ""To thine own self be true!"""
4,No problems,"I placed the order, got the movie shortly thereafter, end of story. Used DVD was in good condition as promised."
3,Barbra Streisand Finally Sings!!!,"I have been an avid Barbra Streisand fan since the release of Enough is Enough w/Donna Summer. She is a phenomenal singer with a voice that only is given by God.My devotion to La Streisand has branched out to seeing her in concert at Madison Square Garden in June of 1994 for a mere $1000. I sat 14 rows back and was unable to talk or function properly after it was over. I think that The Mirror Has Two Faces was a cute movie. It once again revolves around Barbra Streisand as all of her movies do. The only problem that I have is that she acknowledges herself as an actress and denounces herself as a singer.Overall, in my opinion, the movie is worth watching and having as a collectors item within the household"
1,Worthless Fluff,I love Ms.Streisand. I have been a long time fan of hers since the 60s. She has made some great movies but this one is a piece of worthless fluff. Not very good. Only Lauren Bacall saves this one. Jeff Bridges is wasted and Ms.Streisand should have known better. Make something better Barbra. Don't treat your fans to this stuff.
1,Bloody Awful,"I always felt that any moviegoer has a right to expect to be entertained at some level when devoting some hours with a video or in a theater. Let me humbly suggest to a movie fan..You would get more satisfaction out a film such as "" The Deadly Mantis"" than you would watching this abomination.I gave this film one star because a truly fine actor Jeff Bridges, is in this drivel...and because any film with sprocket holes is the result of someones effort...however misguided.CP"
1,-a real stinker,"I love Barbra Streisand and am a huge fan from the sixties. She has made some wonderful movies, starting with her fabulous film debut, Funny Girl. This one though is a real stinker. If you want a funny Streisand movie see ""The Owl and The Pussycat"", You'll laugh your head off. But beware of this one. Ouch! Lauren Bacall is good but Streisand is uncommonly not funny. If I could give it no stars I would.It's stupid, dumb and a real stinker. sorry Babs!, but I still love ya. S-"
2,Disappointed.,This DVD has some parts where the audio does not match the video. I did not return it because of the policy that you only get a 50% exchange if the item is opened. I am not sure how Amazon thinks I can tell if the product is defective or damaged without opening it. I am disappointed with this purchase.
1,zero stars,"Sometimes you have to check on the reviews on a film you know is AWFUL, to see how far you can trust the readership. This is the most revolting and nauseating film I have seen recently. The review above called it correctly. I'll keep reading amazon's readers' reviews."
5,The Mirror Has Two Faces,A great movie with a great cast. Barbra Streisand is wonderful and it is a great story line/love story. I highly recomend this movie
4,Excellent and very entertaining.,"This is a classic Hill/Spencer film, featuring the great chemistry that the pair had in all of their films. Very rarely will you find a combination of actors with such chemistry...If you like the classic action/comedy films of yesteryear (yes, it's a 70's film), then you'll really enjoy this one. I recommend it!"
4,One of Spencer/Hill's funniest films!! A must for fans!,"Non-fans may find this film too corny compared to the Trinity films, but that's why they are not fans! For me, this film is definitely one of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer's best. The opening sequences are priceless, and are followed by episode after episode of hilarious slapstick. Only at some parts toward the end does the pacing of the film feel a bit slack, but this is a film with everything fans could want from a modern Spencer/Hill film."
3,Entertaining but very 70's,This Bud Spencer/Terrence Hill movie is another classic spaghetti movie. The quality could be better but it is entertaining in that slapstick kind of way. It actually has a story and plot which makes it easier to follow than some of their other movies. Bottom line - you will like it if you like these two humorous cowboys in action.
3,"Compilation is OK, but variable recording quality","Good compilation of Stones tunes, but from song to song the quality of the recording is quite variable. Not to mention that some tracks are in mono, not stereo. If you are looking for a historical compilation of Stones tunes, then this is worth having, but you will not be listening to the disc on a frequent basis."
4,MAKE ANOTHER ONE,"without another VOL.2 of this hits album ( One that has the 80's and 90's stuff and maybe ""one shot to the body, and she's so cold"" ) this album is really pointless. It's good but needs another. The rolling stones still do not have a later day hits album. STILL. Another volume of this would be PERFECT.Why set on the 80's and 90's song's hit albums. The rolling stones DON'T need the money. Cd's are going out real fast, so they better make the money off ""VOL.2"" real FAST. So listen-up RECORD COMPANY and MICK."
2,Could have been better,"First of all, this set should have started at '72. ""Brown Sugar"", ""Wild Horses"" are repeats from several other compilations and singles collections; and take up space of songs they left off from this era (such as ""She's So Cold"" and ""Shattered""). Second, the disc has a really harsh copy protection on it. This means that you can't listen to it on your computer or MP3 player. Every time I put the disc in my laptop, it crashes. It is really annoying that I paid for this CD, and can't even listen to it while working or while at the gym."
2,"er, ""Heartbreaker"" ???","aka ""Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo"" ... sorry, but you just can't cover this era without that. The outdated and out-of-print _Rewind_ still stands as a better collection than this. And why on earth would you include ""Fool to Cry"" and ""Hot Stuff"" instead of ""Memory Motel"" or ""Shattered""?"
5,"Great party disc, good recording & worth the $$","Interesting compilation, perfect for those of us who grew up in the 70's. I love it!"
4,Should have been better,"The other reviewers have already mentioned that there are someobvious ommissions and some hard-to-explain selections, but thebiggest problem with this CD is that the sound quality on some ofthe tracks is much worse that it should be. For a CD that claims20-bit mastering, the result is a bit below expectations.The Stones really need to come out with a multi-CD set that picksup where ""Hot Rocks"" left off..."
4,ONE BAD SONG !!!!!,"I wish someone would get it through the ROLLING STONES....""heads""... that the song (UNDERCOVER OF THE NIGHT), is not a ""HIT"" song. In fact, it is one of there most stupid, terrible songs ...EVER. WHY, it is on every hits album...I don't know. BUT. Replace it with ""SHE'S SO COLD "", and then you got a REAL hit. Which is never on the hits albums. Which is a MAJOR dissapointment every time the STONES release a hits CD. Just ask all there real fans.........they'll agree with me."
3,"Great Band, Not Greatest Hits",This CD is good i must say but you can't sum up all The Stones' songs into one CD with only 18 tracks. 40 Licks is much better beacause it has most of their greatest songs on it. I think who ever made this CD left out to many of their best songs.
2,Oh Come on! Get 40 licks,"So Virgin waited a few months and now they come forward with a 'remastered' version of Jump Back. Pathetic. To begin with, the other recently compilation '40 licks' is absolutely better than this one. Second o all, the old 'Jump Back' sounded just fine, so no need to update for a revealing new sound. Third, the new cover art (?) just cannot be compared to the old version. Sorry Virgin, you are not getting my cash this time. How about a best of live stones remastered? Now, that I'd buy."
4,Jump Back; Best of the Rolling Stones 1971-1993,"Good CD, but wish it had ""You Can't Always Get Wht You Want"" on it"
3,"Jump Back - The Best Of The Rolling Stones, '71 - '93","Not the Rolling Stone Greatest Hits album I would like, they have not used Moonlight Mile, Sympathy for the Devil, Can't You Hear Me Knocking, You Can't Always Get What You Want, just to name a few, and I know some do not fall into the 71 - 93 purview, but so many songs they do are great, this doesn't have enough of the songs I would buy a Greatest Hits album for."
2,Longer version of Re-Wind,This compilation is simply an extended version of the 90's CD 'Re-Wind'. Wish they would improve the sonics - same poor quality on a number of songs. Remaster the entire thing and I'd pay twice the price
4,Mixed Emotional CD,"I have Mixed Emotions about this CD compilation. Most of the Stones best songs are here during that era, although I would have liked to have seen ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking?"", ""Monkey Man"", ""Shattered"", ""She's So Cold"", or ""Dance Little Sister"" on it. But the biggest letdown in this CD was the editted version of the Monster Hit: ""Miss You"" by one minute and sixteen seconds. (the singles version) Also, ""Beast of Burden"",""Hot Stuff"", and ""Fool to Cry"" were each cut by almost a full minute! ""Rock and A Hard Place"" was also editted too. (You can hear the eight minute dance version of 'Miss You' on the ""Rarities '71 to '03"" CD, but that was more amusing than fantastic listening.) Overall the 'Jump Back' CD is good, but You Can't Always Get What You Want. If you did, you got me Rocking!"
2,save your money,"A long-time, diehard Stoner, I bought this because (probably like a lot of others) I never fully replaced all my great old Stones albums with their CD successors, and missed a few of the old songs, especially cornball novelties like ""Fool to Cry"" and ""Hot Stuff,"" from the great ""Black and Blue"" album. Needless to say, I was greatly disappointed to find many of the songs edited and cut down. Why? I could understand in the vinyl days when you had x-amount of capacity on one side of a disc, but in the digital age there's no excuse for hacking off parts of these great songs. A less monumental annoyance: I can't explain why but the thing won't play in the iMac I have at work. I've played hundreds of discs on it with no problem but it keeps spitting out ""Jump Back"" and refusing to play. (Maybe the iMac doesn't like edited versions either.) I haven't had this problem with ""Jump Back"" on my PC at home, the car CD player, or my regular stereo, just on the iMac."
3,Should be 2 stars for fans,"This disc is a reflection of the 2nd disc of ""40 LICKS"". The added tracks are the ones they should have had on in the first place. ""Harlem Shuffle"", ""Waiting on a Friend"", ""Bitch"" and ""Rock & a Hard Place"" were all top 20 placements but also nice tracks to listen & dance to. Of course ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Respectable"" were hits of an 'underground' nature - popular to the 'people' so to speak.So that's it! 6 songs total here that were not on the ""40 Licks"" CD. But like it was mentioned in previous reviews here, this makes for a better all-round disc that the #2 disc of ""40 Licks"" had included. I never could figure out when ""40 Licks"" came out why it did not include ""Respectable"" or ""Bitch"" (one of the Stones most popular tracks) or ""Harlem Shuffle"" or another of their most popular songs ""Waiting on a Friend""?So it should be 2 stars, but because of the compilation as a whole without comparison to any other, it could even get 4 stars."
3,Better than buying around 10 cd's for 1 or 2 songs,"Yes there are some great songs on here. And yes, I was dissapointed to see several songs I love not on here. Such as ""Monkey Man"", ""Rocks Off"", ""Rip this Joint"", and last and certainly not least ""Little T&A"". But I am satisfied with songs like ""Start Me Up"", ""Rock and a hard place"", ""Brown Sugar"", and ""Wild Horses"". I recomend also adding to your Stones collection at least HOT ROCKS 1964-71. Well worth your money."
4,Very useful book,"This book is very useful in learning the right English pronunciation, but I would recommend to buy the CD too or get a good teacher, just like I had. Not many pictures, but very good examples."
3,Great - Pitty,"Book is great guide for all who have difficulties with pronunciation BUT ONLY if it is accompanied with CD.Book price is 33 usd and with CD, price goes to 120 usd. Many may not afford to buy CD.Without CD one may have good use of this book only throughout the languuage course but latter it becomes useless.Pitty."
1,never ship,"i order this book, never received. it has been over a monthi tried to contact the seller no respond at all..becarful with this merchant dont order any book with them....i had a very bad experience!!!"
3,For hardcore Portishead-heads only,"I've burned a hole through my ""Dummy"" and ""Portishead"" cd's, so it was nice to hear several alternative takes of two of my favorite tracks. However, the list price is rather steep for the amount of music (less than one regular cd, despite the fact that they put it on two), and you really have to be in the right mood to listen to the same lyrics and chord progressions over and over. Overall, the live album is much more satisfying."
5,Nice new cuts!,"The 2 versions of Glory Box alone is worth the price of this CD!!!Seriously, more great music from a great band!"
3,Interesting but..,I found this interesting but not as enjoyable a listening experience as any of their other CD's. This CD sounds like a bunch of trial versions of songs rather than a polished finished product.
1,Thick and greasy!,"I used this product for almost a week until I could no longer bare it. The smell is terrible, even after I washed my hands it would still linger. I saw little to no change in the color of my face. And worst of all, its very thick and greasy. So if you have sensitive or oily skin do not try this! My skin is a little sensitive and I rarely break out but this brought on many zits :( I guess you get what you pay for!"
1,Old product,"This is the much older version of this product. It is runny, smells like fake tanner, and most annoyingly does not have SPF 20 as Jergens' current , improved product does. Every time I've tried to use it I have to tilt the bottle at an angle because the product is very thin and runny and drips straight out of the bottle. Now I know why it was so cheap! Lesson learned! Shipping was fast."
4,3lw???????,i was an big fan of them around 2002 and 2003. but they went off to be with the cheetah girls whice was coo too. this dvd is fun i guess. they do a lot lip sing whice i don't like. but over it is okay. best to buy it now cus i don't think this dvd is even in stores. but its a good thing to have if your an 3lw or the cheetah girls fan.
5,A Must Read!,"Steven Wise has written one of the most scholarly works since Peter Singer's ""Animal Liberation"" and Tom Regan's ""The Case for Animal Rights"". The arguments are cogent, lucid, and uncompromising. This is a bold work that will not only raise eyebrows but also incite change. The concept of rights is presented in detail in ""Rattling the Cage"", it will undoubtedly also contribute greatly to those interested in human rights. It should be noted however that Wise's work may be viewed as anthropocentric, for it uses human (legal) standards to define who deserves rights. For those who are interested in animal rights philosophy, please additionally consult works by Peter Singer, Tom Regan, and Gary Francione."
5,The First True Animal Rights Law Book,"Others have written books about how to theoretically gain legal rights for animals, but Steve Wise is the first lawyer to present how to actually do it. Hope, now Mr. Wise will expand his knowledge to ALL animals.He does not propose that chimpanzee have the right to sue or to vote, but he does say they have the right to live their lives in peace without our involvement. Do they not have the right to have THEIR habitat protected? Do they not have the right to not be kidnapped from their family and homes and to be locked in a cage subjected to years of horrific and inhumane tests for the sole benefit of mankind? They DO have the right to be left alone. I guess it is a long road since mankind has no humanity for itself.Rattling the Cage is a must read book, not only for lawyers, but for all compassionate humans."
5,Great WWII Game,"Finally, Edios brings greatness back to the Commandos label - it is too bad they waited so long because most people didn't give this game a try. Not the very best WWII first person shooter (Call of Duty) but very good and different in important ways. First, it is not (mostly) about running through the fray and killing, it is about stealth and guile. You get to see a first person shooter from an angle not widely explored, literaly behind enemy lines (as the spy). Watch German soldiers doing PT, getting drunk, dressed down, and visiting with local females (french). Although Amazon lists it as an E rating, it is actually rated T, and probalby should be rated M. Cussing, bloddy violence and sexual themes are common and add to the ""real"" feel of the game."
1,This game is too Lame!,Sorry but this game is not worth buying. It is too simple and resembles a Commodore 64 pc game. It may play well on really old systems for young kids.
5,Pretty Cool,"Item came fast, will buy from again, thank you! This game is a little older but still an awesome game. I'm playing it now. You playing different characters during the same round. When you hit tab, it goes from one guy to the next. I checked it out on YouTube, & I thought it was cool so I bought it. It is a really good game and would like to get some of the other games in the series. I think they made five in total. You will like this game!"
5,Great Goggles - Use for Cycling,"I bought these to use for cycling over my prescription glasses. I have dry eyes that get irritated by the wind, road dirt, etc. I did have to make a cut on either side of the rubber seal and then I have to take the clear eye shield off each time to put my glasses in/out of them. They work very well for this purpose - although I look like I should be skiing instead of cycling."
5,super cool!!,Very detailed figure of David Bowie as The Goblin King. It stands out in any collection. I'm very happy with the quality and design of this figure.
3,"Jareth, on helium","I don't know if there is just something wrong with the one I received, but his voice is so high pitched it sounds like he just swallowed a full balloon of helium. It's much faster than he speaks the lines in the movie as well. His hand that holds the crystal ball literally fell out, and the crystal ball is now nowhere to be found. Poor design in that aspect. They should have just attached the crystal ball to the hand, no reason to have it be removable."
1,Worthless! Does not fit the listed application!,This fuel line repair kit was worthless to me. It is 10 inches too short to reach past the damaged spot on my '91 Ford F 150 front tank line. I ordered another one to get the hose barb and some extra line length as it was cheaper than buying extra line or a hose barb. Once I got it all assembled I found out the fitting does not even fit the tank.
4,A great album,"This is a recording of Monty Python's live perforamnce at New York's City Center in April of 1976. Although it contains some of their best material, the performances aren't Monty Python's greatest. Reason being is because Arista Records wanted the album out while the show was going on, so the first few and worst performances were recorded. But it's still a great album for their fans. Interesting to note, the ""Lumberjack Song"" on this record features ex-Beatle George Harrison as one of the mounties. Unfortunately for Britain, this album was only released in America."
4,Beautiful Plumage!,"Monty Python are possible the best comedy troupe ever. They ruled the television in England, and eventually took over the US. They made some of the funniest skits and movies made. But how are they live? On this disc Monty Python do some of their most famous skits and some lesser known, yet equally funny skits. If you enjoy Monty Python's Flying Circus or any of their movies, you will laugh until you die."
4,better than their TV shows,"I would say that in the performances on this album the cast is much more energetic than in the TV shows. If you were to listen to bits like ""The Argument Clinic"" and ""Crunchy Frog"" here and then compare them with the original TV series versions on YouTube, you're going to notice that here the cast seems much more switched on."
2,Cheap black and white photocopy of original,"I am only reviewing the format of this book. It is a black and white photocopy of the original which is bound in softcover. To read it, you have to turn the book sideways, i.e. it is printed in landscape format but bound vertically. It is 80 pages long. Given the price, I would expect a better reprint."
4,Ladies Laptop/handbag,"I searched far and wide before I finally placed an order for the Milano. I really like this bag - specially since it has everything a laptop bag must have for a Woman. with all the manly looking boring laptop bags around us girls don't get a variety to choose from. But it's nice to actually find designers who think of style as well as practicality. The only reason I gave it a 4 * rating is cos I'm not too keen on the fux croc look. I was hoping it wouldn't be very prominent but not so! it's VERY prominent! and will take some getting use to if like me, you prefer a polished looking bag (and those are impossible to find with the Milano's features!) It fits my 14 inch HP really well and have loads of space for my other stuff! all in all - I would have to say good buy! oh and I bought the smaller version - there are two."
5,Seriously worth the money!!,"I was a little worried about spending almost 70$ on this bag, but when I recieved it I was so impressed. I really love this bag! Very well made!! The crocadile pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows, but I really like it. To be honest I shy away from croc patterns, but it really works with this bag! I have a 15.4 in. Gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag."
4,"Excellent Bag, 4.5 stars.","I bought this bag for my laptop about 5 months ago when I needed something less bulky than I had. Its got loads of room for screens up to 15"", as well as space for essentials like your power cord, pens, mobile phone, cosmetics, hardcopy files, etc. I'm always on the go and my bag has taken some damage as a result. A few scratches but they're barely noticeable, and harsh weather and my computer remains safe.I don't regret making the purchase, its definitely worth the money, however I'd use the fabric sheath that comes inside. I noticed after a few weeks of heavy use my white MacBook had very faint black lines on it from the lining of the bag's computer pocket. These can be removed with a product like iKlear though."
2,Looks cheap!!!,"The bag was not what I was expecting, and, furthermore, the retailer SUCKS in terms of their return policy."
4,Great Bag!,I had been searching for a while to replace my wheeled computer bag with something for short trips. I absolutely love the look of the bag and it has plenty of room for my lap top and files. I only wish the handle were a little bit longer. Overall a great bag for the money!
5,I really related to the main actress.,This movie was awesome because everyone involved obviously cared about the project and the final result is a movie anyone can enjoy many times. Excellent! Lol. Really good.
5,Sognstress,This cd of Angela displays her gifts as a singer. Where is she? Why isn't she touring? She is wonderful and the songs are a great experience to listen to.
4,Excellent singer.,"Fantastic vocals & beautiful songs. ""Angel of the Night"" is pretty and has a great beat. :)"
4,fluidmpr for cummins,Seems to be a new (not used) Fluidampr product at a price ($376.87) more reasonable than the usual sellers.Really quiets the 2001 HO Cummins down w/real smooth acceleration through 2K rpm. Highway speeds are more quiet too. Runs like you have really good fuel in the tank.
2,Unlucky...got a bad phone...went dead on me,"I had this phone for about 6 months and then it just died on me. No power or anything, even after trying a different AC adapter so either I was unlucky with my particular phone or this phone's quality is low like its price. I really liked it when it worked! Just keep your receipts in case it dies and you need to get it fixed under warranty."
5,Summer In Love!,"Another consistently amazing album by Pinback! Pinback follows the same formula as previous albums but manages to capture an underline intensity both lyrically and musically on Summer in Abaddon. This album at low volumes sounds very straightforward and mellow but takes on a whole new attitude at higher volumes. Both Rob and Armistead are brilliant on their instruments and arrangements and it's certainly highlighted on this album. If you're a former Pinback fan, you...like me...might think it's a lot of the same, but please do them and yourself a favor and give it a few complete listens through. This album sits at the top slot on my best of 2004 list so far.Rob Crow comes by way of Heavy Vegetable, Thingy, Optiganally Yours and his list goes on. Armistead Burwell Smith IV comes by way of 3 Mile Pilot and just recently released his own side project called Systems Officer.Buy and enjoy, I have been a little too much!"
5,Pinback discovered!,"I heard Pinback first on Sirius Left of Center and I bought their recent album. They kind of remind me of Modest Mouse, but they have a unique sound to their own. I especially like songs 1, 5, and 7. Just watch them blossom...I hope they come to northern California!"
3,"Great Vocals in studio, So-So vocals live","Like alot of people , I was mesmerized by Rob Crow's lovely vocals on song's I heard on the radio like ""Penelope"" and ""Fortress"". Upon seeing them live in a San Diego concert last year, Crow's voice live sounded nothing like the recording on various songs like Fortress and Penelope.I was rather disapointed , however some of the other songs sounded better and instrumentally were tight. Anybody else share the same opinion ? or is it just me ?"
5,Can't Top Listening to Pinback,"I first heard this band recently on an OC compilation CD on iTunes. I didn't buy the OC CD, and instead bought the Pinback CD (""Summer in Abbadon""). This is the first CD I've bought in a year that I keep playing over and over. The overall mood of the music is hypnotic, driving and lyrical, filled with catchy riffs and beats.I can honestly say there's not one single song that I don't like, but, I especially like Soaked, Fortress, The Yellow Ones, Non Photo-Blue, and AFK. If you're into alternative rock, I think you'll love this CD. I'm plan to buy all of Pinback's CDs now."
1,Worst book ever?,"Ok, I am a great fan of Harry Harrison. I think he's a magnificent author. But, this book, is the biggest piece of trash I have read. I have a version printed in 1976, copyrighted in 1973 and it reads like something from the 1940s in attitude, content and style. If it's supposed to be serious, it's not, because you can't take it seriously; if it's supposed to be funny, it also misses the mark. If I wanted people to become fans of Harry Harrison and his work, I would steer them away from this book. I can not imagine what anyone was thinking to suggest this be reprinted again in the 2000s."
3,Sequel to Western Classic,"High Noon Part II is a TV Movie sequel to the Western classic with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. In this sequel Lee Majors (Bionic Man) plays Will Kane, the legendary marshal. The story picks up a year after the immortal gunfight that united the town of Hadleyville. When the town falls prey to a new reign of terror and lawlessness. Will Kane returns to take up his gun for a final showdown.The official TV movie title was High Noon the Return of Will Kane. The 96min Film premiered on CBS TV in 1980. It also stars David Carradine, Pernell Roberts, Emmet Walsh, and Michael Pataki."
2,"A Mixed Bag, Indeed!","One reader of this book has noted that this book is a ""mixed bag"". I think he/she is exactly right.Obviously, this author has done something pretty remarkable, and has compiled a unique treatment of the history of economics. And the writing style is engaging and entertaining. In many areas, too, the author is very balanced and accurate. In other areas, not very balanced at all nor accurate.The author resorts often to equivocation and the adoration of Keyenes is sometimes nauseating. And the omission of any significant treatment of Austrian economics is glaring.In the final analysis, the strength of this book is also its downfall. The unique narrative style of unfolding the content makes it intriguing and sets it apart from other economics books. But it also contributes to a lack of objectivity and a lack of balance at some points."
4,"A brief review of economic history-no more, no less","A decent review of economic philosophy as it changed across time. Not very much depth, but that's the point. This book is on the ""List of Unrequired Reading"" from UT-Austin, my undergraduate institution. I can't say it's well-written, but probably as easy to read as economics gets. As other reviewers have noted, you read about one period/economist and wish there was more substance given. However, if this were the case, the book would be 1000 pages. After each section, I found myself going to Wikipedia for more information. At the end of the day I learned quite a bit. I'd say this makes a good quick read that would be useful to those lacking a basic understanding of economics and/or the concept of free markets (some of my liberal friends come to mind here).For a better combination of educational (history) and entertaining reading, I'd suggest something by Daniel Boorstin like The Discoverers."
2,An interesting contrast,"I recently assigned Heilbroner along with New Ideas from Dead Economics (by Todd Buchholz) in a college course and found them a useful contrast. Buchholz is a bit to the right of the mainstream and Heilbroner is far to the left, so they usually give different perspectives on the economists of the past. If I were to use only one, Buchholz would be the clear choice. Heilbroner is a better writer than he is an economist, while Buchholz is both a gifted writer and a sound economist. Perhaps because he is unhappy with most of what has happened in the past half century in economics, Heilbroner ends his book with Schumpeter in the 1940s. In contrast, Buchholz believes that the past half century has been a creative and exciting time in economics and, hence, one gets from him a better sense of what is happening in economics today."
3,Surreptitiously tendentious.,"Many people (witness the other reviews below) receive their introduction to the history of economic thought by reading this book. What a shame, then, that it is such a statist account. If you are going to read this tome, note that praise of Keynes, Schumpeter, Galbreath, _et al._ is a partisan activity, and that not everyone thinks more government is better (or better economics, for that matter). Indeed, this point of view is generally on the retreat throughout the world -- except in American publishing and academia."
2,Keynes and Smith chapters were great,"An ""ok"" read, I only bought it because Greg Mankiw recommended it on his blog. The only chapters I enjoyed were the ones on Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes. Everything else is irrelevant.next on my reading list: Reinventing the Bazaar"
2,THE most boring book ever,"I'm very happy that the only time I had to read this was for an extra credit paper. Terribly dry. Not a ""for fun"" reading book, in my opinion."
3,good but......,"An excellent overview but far too brief. I would have paid more for a book with twice the pages if more detail of each economist's theories had been included. I found myself having to fill in too many blanks when only generalized descriptions and abstract ideas are offered - specific examples bring economics to life - whether historical economics gone by or present day. Also, the book comes up a bit short by not including Milton Friedman."
5,A Gem!!,"I first read ""The Worldly Philosophers"" in an economics class in college and enjoyed it so much that I've read it a couple times since. Heilbroner does a wonderful job explaining the basics in economic thought from the Pre Adam Smith world through David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Henry George, John M. Keynes, and Joseph Schumpeter. This is a gem!"
1,Keynesian Bias,"While the book covers most of the early economists and John Maynard Keynes and those following in his footsteps, it leaves out Ludwig von Mises and Milton Friedman and it only mentions Friedrich Hayek 3 times in references to letters written to him. So as far as Heilbronner is concerned, Austrian Economics does not exist. He also admits that he leans toward Social Democracy and he glorifies Europe."
1,This book was poorly written,"This book was not one of my favorites...in fact I didn't like it at all. I think they undermind what it is to be a writter. I don't think this author should write any more books. I had to read this book for my economics class and the whole class struggled through it because they thought it was poorly written. I think it had good points, but the author didn't carry them out in the right way."
5,Impeccable piece of reference material,"Very difficult read, not all of the book is in roman letters, the greek is particularly difficult as it is not transliterated. But still a fun read. Well worth it if you can read in german, greek, latin, engish, and norse."
5,A wonderful perspective on a green city,"As a city-dweller I love cafes, the opera, the night-life.... but I also need the trees, the birds, and the Puget Sound. Williams' wonderful collection of notes on my hometown, Seattle, are a fun read and have helped me discover things I would have never discovered otherwise. If you live in Seattle, or even if you're coming for a visit and want an alternative to the regular tourist attractions, this book is for you. Enjoy!"
5,Great nature walks without leaving your armchair,"I learned a lot about Seattle that I can't wait to tell visitors (guess what's under I-5?!) and got inspired to take some of the urban nature walks myself, like all the way along Thornton Creek. What I liked best was the view of what Seattle historically looked like - accompanied by really nice maps!"
4,Neutrogena is known for quality and this product ...,"Neutrogena is known for quality and this product is no exception. Neutrogena Fresh Body Herbal Body Wash smells fabulous! The smell is really relaxing, like a mini trip to the spa. My skin felt softer and silkier. It's so mild, I even used it on my 1-year-old. Now we both smell great! I would definitely buy again, and I'm looking forward to more great products from Neutrogena."
3,This is a refreshing body wash with a ...,"This is a refreshing body wash with a mild, herbal scent, appropriate for both men and women. I'd say that it's good for people who have sensitive skin and who like a very mild fragrance. Since it is """"soap-free,"""" though, it doesn't lather very much and I found that I used a lot of it at one time when taking a shower. It did not, however, dry out my skin at all (unlike some other shower gels). Personally, I like earthier smelling products (vanilla, sandalwood) with a little more intensity. This would be a great product for someone with sensitive, dry skin."
3,"This product claimed to have herbal fragrance extracts, ...","This product claimed to have herbal fragrance extracts, but, when looking on the label, I saw plenty of chemicals but no mention of herbs. While the fragrance was inoffensive, it wasn't particularly invigorating, either. I liked that it was soap-free, and not harsh on my skin. I also liked the packaging, but I would probably recommend a more natural herbal product to family or friends."
3,This product was average. If I was grading ...,"This product was average. If I was grading it, I would give it a C. The smell is unusual. It reminded me of stepping into the refrigerated section at the florist -- interesting, but not something you really want to capture in a soap. I've tried other gel products and this one, in comparison, isn't one of the best. I think Neutrogena should improve the texture of the gel and that weird scent. On a positive note, the packaging is cool, highlighting the product's pale green color."
4,I really liked the smell of this product ...,"I really liked the smell of this product and the fact that it was a deodorant soap. The soap did not dry out my skin and left a clean smell. The only problem I had was that the size was not big enough for one person to use for any length of time, let alone a whole family. I liked the product, but it could get expensive to stay clean with it."
3,I enjoyed trying the Neutrogena Body Wash. It ...,"I enjoyed trying the Neutrogena Body Wash. It leaves your skin feeling clean but not dry. At first I thought the scent was refreshing and clean, but it can be a little overpowering for a body wash. I would use it every once in a while but to use it on a daily basis you'd have to really love the scent. Which I don't."
2,It took too long to get shipped,"It took about a month to get shipped to my home. I was supposed to receive it in 5 to 9 business days. The books were in great condition, but that is not the point. I expected Amazon to ship my products in a timely manner, but they did not I am very disappointed."
3,"This is certainly no Apocalypse Dudes, but, then again...","neither was Scandanavian Leather. Post-resurection turbo has taken some getting used to for me. Polished and stunningly produced, Party Animals just doesn't seem to have that ""death punk"" feel. All that said, it is a damn fine listen. Just don't expect any Are you Ready (for some darkness?) or Princes of the Rodeos on this one. I really dig Death from Above and High on the Crime. Of course, Euroboys playing and Hank's hollerin' are both top notch. It is worth the money just for the inclosed liner note photos. If I had it to do all over again, I would be patient and wait for a domestic release and maybe save a few bucks."
2,"Bright light, crummy mount","I really liked this light for the 3 months or so that it lasted. It's bright, uses readily-available AA batteries (I found rechargeable NiMH ones, which held a charge for a long time). The problem is the plastic mount is well behind the center of gravity, so it bounces a lot on rough roads. That's what killed my light: I was riding on a gravel road, and the fatigue simply caused the light to break off its mount. The light itself still works, but the mounting is irreparable, so I had to toss the whole thing."
4,Very good headlight,"I use 2500mA Ni-Mh rechargeable batteries forin that headlight, but still provides very good light for a very long period.Mostly I use the flashing mode, just to be seen by cars. And it is very visible, even for a long distance."
4,Good Light,"This light has some advantages that others have not mentioned... It has a clear lens, which makes it easier for people to see you, and more light shines to the sides, as compared to the typical low-cost light with a focused lens. I aim the light low at night, and high during the day so others will see me, which is easy because the mounting strap knob requires no tools to loosen and tighten. Because the light has a narrow spot that is not as bright as I want, I use it along with a Princeton Tec light that has a wide spot. This dual-light setup gives more light and wider coverage. Note: The CatEye website no longer shows this model, so it is probably being replaced soon with a more expensive model."
1,Defective,"These look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick, ruining the shoes completely. Do not buy them."
1,Made cheaper than in the past!!,I agree. I've had several pairs of these over the years and they never tore up like they do now. Last pair I bought I brought back because they tore up and got another pair....well they tore up too. Now I need to find a replacement!
4,Comfortable but not durable,"My feet sweat a LOT; and these are the first slides/sandals I have been able to wear without sticking to them. The nubs were painful at first, but after a few days wearing them 30 min or so / day, I got used to them, and they are now extremely comfortable. They also have better arch support than some of the other styles (although still not much). They do start to smell bad after a week or so; and the only way I have found to clean them effectively is with a mild bleach cleaner (I use Clorox ""Cleanup"" and a soft scrub brush, but any mild bleach solution should work). The only problem I have with these is that the nubs fall off. I have been through 3 pair in 2 summers. I also tried the Santiossage, hoping that the nubs would last longer; but they are essentially the same shoe, and fall apart just as quickly."
4,great for grillers on the move,"Pros:This a well constructed bag that holds the baby-q, gas tank, grease trays and tools. It allows me to throw the grill in the back seat of my car and just go. The wheels work well on most surfaces and the other straps make it easy to carry.Cons:not much to complain about..I wish it held the grill stand as well, or attached to it."
2,R. Elliott,The product is basically tasteless. It took a very very long time to arrive. I don't think I will be ordering any food items from Amazon again.
3,Adventures in NYC,"Robert Nathan was known for his short, adult fairy tales, in which fantastic events occur (usually but not always), while the underlining themes are the time honored ones: faith, love, patriotism, loyalty, etc. He produced roughly one book a year for many decades. This novel is about a dog (Tapiola) who, along with a canary, hide in an ashcan, get picked up, go on a garbage barge to Staten Island, meet a rabbit and a rat, and hop the ferry back to Manhattan. Along the way the animals discuss love and honesty, among other things. Cute, but Nathan did better work than this."
4,good stuff,"It's hard to find some items where I live so I pretty much depend on mail-order or driving into or closer to NYC for exotic stuff. I heard a lot about smoked paprika on The Food Network so I thought I'd give it a shot.The 'smoke' is a bit strong, so I recommend a light hand, but it's delicious in a lot of applications where you'd use regular paprika, and it was wonderful in home fries, fried eggs and homemade hotdog style onion sauce.The top of the entire can pops off, so be careful if you're a one-hand-tied- behind-my-back type of cook or you might end up with half the can in your pot."
2,Boston Pendent,"I thought it was bigger than what I saw in it's description. I bought it under that impression. When I received it, it was the size of a dime. I bought it for my boyfriend's chain, and it looked microscopic on him... so embarassing.... :0("
5,SIMPLY SUPERB DANCE MUSIC,"I grew up in the Soviet Union. Boney M was one of the first Western dance music bands my buddies and I taped and DJed in our ""homemade"" discos! What a grand time it was! In the early 80s, the band became a living legend with their songs ""Rasputin"" ""Sunny"" ""Nightflight to Venus"" etc. I am very happy you have such a great selection of their albums. This one has all their truly best titles!"
5,"thanks, amazon!","more than 20 years ago Boney M came to the USSR for just a few shows. I, a college student at the time, spent two very cold winter nights in a huge line for tickets - and did not get them... Listening to these great tunes did some magic to me: it carried me to my youth - to that Moscow winter of 1979, to those evenings in our dorm filled with Boney M, Smokey, and Genghiz Khan... Thanks, Amazon for reviving those memories!"
4,a terrific group,Having lived in Jamaica in the early 80's I'm excited to find this cd. I tried unsucesssfully to find it there recently.
1,poor quality,This would be a wonderful selection of songs by a vibrant and funny performer. But the sound quality is terrible. Don't purchase this CD. You'll be sorely disappointed.
4,A good sports book but those who like tell-all books will be disappointed,"Unlike most sports autobiographies, this book is not filled with anecdotes and points of remembrance about games they were involved in. Richardson was a devout Christian during his entire career, so there are many references to that faith and fewer notes about major events in his career.Furthermore, the book was written before the major work ""Ball Four"", which made it acceptable to write about the reality of baseball life, although Richardson does occasionally mention the temptations. Therefore, in many ways the modern reader will find the book dull when compared to the tell-all aspects of the sports books of the last thirty years. Nevertheless, there was much to admire about Richardson, he was a sound player, both on the field and at the plate and his role in the dominant Yankee teams of his era is often overlooked. His life was a good and honest one, often a rarity among modern athletes."
4,"This product is absolutely terrific! It smells great, ...","This product is absolutely terrific! It smells great, and leaves your skin so soft and touchable -- no more tight, itchy skin for me!"
2,I don't like the way this body wash ...,"I don't like the way this body wash smells, so I don't recommend it. Unlike most other Neutrogena soaps, it has a moderately strong floral scent, sort of sweet and musty, which lingers on your skin after a shower. If I hadn't found the fragrance so unpleasant, I would've given this product four stars. It's thicker than Neutrogena Rainbath -- thick enough to use with or without a washcloth. It also lathers well, rinses off easily, and didn't dry out my skin like some soaps do."
4,I really liked this product. It left my ...,"I really liked this product. It left my skin soft and smooth, and it smelled terrific. I'd recommend it to friends and family. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are similar products that cost less than this one."
3,"This product made my skin smoother, just like ...","This product made my skin smoother, just like it claimed. It's much thicker than other body washes and lathers well. The scent could be better. The aroma isn't bad, just not really good either. It smelled similar to fabric softener. This is a gentle, lotion-like body wash. It's not a body scrub, so if you want exfoliation, you have to use a loofa or bath scrubber with it."
2,older version,"I love this book, but did not realize that the earlier edition was so different from the revised!The text is different, the pictures are different. The rhymes do not flow as nicely, and there are not as many examples of shapes to make the images as the newer book. I would rather have the newer edition..."
4,Tough but good!,"This one's tough from the get go, but Kelsie's infectious energy kept me wanting to work harder! I used 8 lb weights and found them to be extremely challenging. Her cueing seemed to get better as the workout goes on - parts of the warmup moved a little fast and caught me a little off guard. She keeps in tempo throughout. I have never done any kickboxing outside of some basic moves which appear in other FIRM workouts and would have found a tutorial helpful, although the moves were explained as they were introduced. The workout was about 5 minutes shorter than the duration noted on the DVD case of 45 minutes. I enjoyed this workout overall - I can't wait to work it into my rotation!"
5,WOW!,"I love the FIrm workouts! This is at the top of the list for favorites! If you are familiar with the Firm workouts it is easy to catch on to the rhythm, fast paced and a great workout!"
3,Not my favorite Firm DVD,"I own about a dozen firm DVDs and do them almost every weekday morning. This workout and the other one that Kelsie leads are my least favorite. Her moves are easy enough to follow but the quality isn't the same as the rest of the Firm workouts. The studio is different-- it looks outdated and the other Firm workout girls aren't the experienced ones you usually see. This DVD is okay, just doesn't have the overall great feeling I get from the rest of the Firm workouts."
5,Not my favorite,I love The Firm and the 500 Calorie workout is one of my all time favorites. I had very high hopes for this one but it just did not deliver. It was not kickboxy enough and the segments seemed to drag on and on.
4,"Great workout overall, but wanted a bit more cardio","I really like Kelsie Daniels and this workout. She alternates between sets of strength training and cardio intervals. However, I felt that the cardio intervals could have been a bit longer with more emphasis on kickboxing. She is not annoying or overly peppy and I have added this workout to my regular rotation of workout videos."
4,How can this possibly be the first review of this book?,"A collection of short stories, Daughter or Regals suffers most from its title story, which takes its own sweet time getting to a point. Taken as a sketch of his work to come however, particularly Mirror of Her Dreams, it gives you a look at one of Mr. Donaldson's rough drafts.The rest of the stories included are better, a wide mix of urban fantasy and cyberpunk. Of greatest interest to the fan of the Thomas Covenant Chronicles is a deleted Book of The Illearth War, written entirely from the perspective of the haruchai. The author explains why it was deleted, which make sense, but I found myself coming away with a greater understanding of the Chronicles after reading it, and I wish that it had not been removed."
5,A+,"I bought this for my baby sister who is 11 yrs old (17 yrs my junior)bc our mom was completely silent about issues of morality and sexuality during my teen years and I wanted my baby sis to have some moral compass at this critical time. It has been such a blessing to my sister and our mom bc it started alot of conversations between them that my mother admitted she never would have started. She thanked me profusely for giving this book to them. My sister is very curious about boys, babies, gays, and tattoos and this magazine addresses them from a Christian worldview without being ""preachy"" or derogatory. I was impressed by the big emphasis on purity and modesty, two things that are not addressed enough in our culture. And the ""teen magazine"" format makes it very appealing and easy to read."
5,Great Book/Series,"I bought these for my fourteen-year-old daughter, and she absolutely loves them. She says that they've really helped bring her closer to God and answered a lot of questions she had. The series addressed issues such as purity, gay marriage, abortion, modesty, fitting in, guys, and friends in a Christianly way without derogatory statements. The books are set up like a teen magazine with several pictures and quizzes that helped keep her attention. All in all, I think the series would be a great gift to any teenage girl."
5,Great book for teens,My daughter loves this book/magazine. It's easy to read and very up to date with the issues teens face in this world. These books help you get the truth to our teens. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND the entire series.
5,So much fun,"Clovermead has everything a reader could ask for...a cast of characters I really cared about, a clever plot twist, and bears!"
1,My school must not have been very good,"Mathematicians may find the ""elementary algebra"" in this book to be free of ""mathematic rigor,"" but stupid people like me who went to public school will probably feel otherwise after struggling through the first page. I'm still looking for the wavelet equivalent of the excellent ""Who is Fourier?""; this book is definitely not it, and it's definitely not worth $40."
5,Great Book!!!,"This book is a great book. Once again, Patrick walks you through the digital aspect of digital photography for weddings & portraits. This is a great book for someone who is considering going digital. It is also a great book for someone who has already made the leap into digital because Patrick explains things in such a way that everyone can understand. I have been shooting digital for over a year now and I found this book to be very helpful. It explained alot of things for me. It clarified things that I was confused on.I have read all of Patrick Rice's books. And I highly recommend all professional photographers do the same. Patrick has won many awards for his work. We could all learn something from him."
2,A perspective why digital is better. Not how to take better pictures,"This is a book about why digital is better with perspectives from several people. It is not about digital photography techniques used for weddings or portraits. I found no usefull information for me in this book!It does have a few nice photos in it but overall I found it to be a total waste of my money. If you think you may want this book, make sure you take a look at it at your local book store before buying it."
2,same disc installing issues,"I had the same problem installing B&W to my powerrbook...upon the request to insert the ""Data disc"", the darn thing just spit right back out of the drive. Very frustrating and the support websites listed in the manual don't help out either."
4,New Order Rythyms with a Euphoric Elektronika Beat,"No matter if you like the 80's or a die-hard techno fan, this c.d. is a must. You find some extraordinary talent from a ""redefined"" New Order. New Order shows their genius by fusing together the familiar sounds of the 80's with the maturing/rejuvenated method of neoteric techno. Worth every penny."
3,New Order Techno Style,"The cd is a good cd if you like new order. I personally don't own another cd by them. I purchased the cd becasuse of a song that appears on the soundtrack ""Blade"". This song is super intense and for the price the rest of the songs are better on this cd than on the ""Blade"" soundtrack. If you like New Order or techno with a 80's flashback this is a good pick."
5,The Best Biggest Beat Baby!,"In my opinion, the best song on this CD is track 4, Confusion- Pump Panel Reconstrucion mix. This is the same song from all the movie previews for ""Blade,"" and from the part of the movie itself in the beginning when they are in the vampire dance club. This song is the ultimate toe-thumper, and I didn't want to get the Blade Soundtrack because I'm not that into rap, and because of the explicit lyricks warning. Also, I am able to hear some other interesting techno beats insted of wasting twenty bucks on a CD with only one song I know I'll like. THE ULTIMATE DANCE BEAT!!!"
4,Techno-Dance Remixes of Familiar New Order Tunes,"If you tend to get headaches from 90's boom-boom repetitive dance beats, this piece probably isn't for you. If you like the Joy Division-type moody New Order, again, this probably isn't for you. If not one of those people and you're drawn to the group's dance beat and mysterious lyrics, this CD is sure to be a favorite. Great driving music."
2,"no, thank you","Looking at the import price tag, and the fact that these songs are better in their original incarnations, all I have to say is ""No, thanks, I'll take a pass on this one."""
1,NOT RECEIVED IT YET!!!!!!,"I'VE NOT YET RECEIVED THE PRODUCT YET, SO I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS A GOOD VALUE. I'VE COMPLAINED SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT NOT RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, BUT NOBODY HAS BOTHERED TO RESPOND. SO I GUESS I LOST MY MONEY!"
3,Not very comfortable.,I'm using these to hang from an overhead bar to attempt to rehab my shoulders. They are not very comfortable for this purpose. They are too narrow around the wrist and so they cut off the circulation to the hand as they don't spread the force over a wide enough are. I haven't found a better alternative so I don't know if there are better ones. Perhaps using these to augment your grip when doing lat pull downs might work better than trying to hold my fat 185lb butt for several minutes from an overhead bar.
3,ok,the hooks dont really fit olympic barbells... they do a little bit.. hard to explain. could use some more padding for the wrist too.
1,My product arrived not working - vendor will not respond,I have sent email to the vendor that shipped my camera and to Amazon - but no one responds -The camera is $800 and the on off switch does not work - so the camera does not work
2,Not as nice as pictured,The wood color and shine is nice enough but the spoon is all scratched and chipped. Also not very functional because the spoon is too flat.
2,No data,"News flash: We really have no hard data on Paul of Tarsus.I could not get into this book because it consists of non-stop arm waving speculation about Paul's character, generated from historical records that are apparently not much better than the record about Paul. I am an avid reader of biographies of scientists. I was looking for a biographer's insight into the person and life of Paul. But this book was written several centuries too late to provide the payload.The style of the book is classical scholarship. Glover has read everything written about Paul and is weaving all of it together for you in these pages. If you want a tapestry of inferences, this is your book. If you want data, probably not."
1,Review of Tom Roed's Original plus 12,"Tom Roed's books always are the best music books of all that I have played. His arrangements are awesome. When I play them, people stop whatever they are doing and listen. However, be very careful about the level of the arrangements when you buy his books. This particular book is for Level 3 Easy and will be too easy for the advanced pianist."
4,take time to read this book,if you want to know how to hear from God this is a good book- but this book is not the kind of book you can rush through- this book will make you read a page or 2 and then see quietly and tell God what you want to know and then you gotta wait on him- This book teaches you to hang out with God
2,Defending a Conversational Relationship with God,"If I've bought a book entitled ""Hearing God"", I'm probably open to the idea hearing God is possible. The author spends over half of the book citing evidence that God can communicate with His children. The subtitle should be ""defending a conversational relationship with God"" instead of ""developing a conversational relationship with God."
3,"Good Points, but..","There are great points made in the book, but it's not as easy of a read as I thought. The writing is a bit too sophisticated for me."
4,"Helpful and inspiring, thoughtful and readable","This is an excellent inspirational book for Christians, especially for those to whom ""personal relationship"" with God is important. This would also be a great book for non-Christians confused and possibly frightened by friends or public officials who claim to speak to and hear from God. This author tackles difficult issues like manipulative leaders or hearing voices is psyochosis."
3,deep thinking,"We recently finished this book as a group, and it generated some good discussion. Willard is a philosopher, and some of the material went over our heads. The book has 9 chapters, but I think it could have been condensed into 6 or 7. It does challenge your current notions of how one goes about hearing from God and if you even believe it is possible."
2,not what its cracked up to be,"I picked up this book because of the recommendation Richard Foster gives it (under its old title) in his book ""Celebration of Discipline."" He claims it is the best book on Guidance. For all I know, it probably is. I just can't seem to read Willard. I don't think it is because he is too ""hard."" I just think his writing is less than compelling. I have tried to slog through all three of his major books now (the others being ""The Spirit of the Disciplines"" and ""The Divine Invasion""), and all of them are just boring. They make some good points, but I feel Foster's work covers most of this ground while being much more well written. Maybe its just me. But Willard is just too stale for my tastes."
4,A Glimpse of What Can Be...,"In ""Hearing God,"" Dallas Willard runs through the prison stuffing keys in all the cell doors, inviting us to turn the key and be set free from our preconceived notions of when and how God speaks to us. Make no mistake, this is no light summer reading, and it will require a lot of time to digest everything he has to say. I recently finished reading this book, and I feel as if scales have fallen from my eyes. Willard is pointing us toward what life can be like if you would only have confidence in the fact that God wants to speak to you, if only you would know what frequency to tune your ears to (I know, that's a horrible analogy, but it's the best I can come up with while staring at a computer monitor).Trust me, please, read this book prayerfully and with the full expectancy that God will open your eyes to all that is truly going on around you. It will forever change you..."
4,Hearing God,this has been a good book to understand the ways god speaks to us in our every day lives. It is a book for a more advanced reader.
3,Pretty good!,I purchased two of these books. I gave one away as a gift and kept the other one for myself. Very insightful and helpful information.
1,Hard to read,"We picked this book in our small group. At first I thought I was the only one having problem understanding what the author is trying to say. After reading chapter 3, a couple of people started saying huh? This is not an easy book to read and understand. The author goes around in circle and doesn't get to the point."
2,Not for me,Maybe because i'm not in my forties or fifties and have never experienced marriage or having kids......is the reason i didn't like this book. I didn't think it was a bad storyline but I felt the way everything came together it was too unrealistic. I really couldn't get into the characters either--her husband seemed boring and cold. I wouldn't read this book again and I wouldn't recommend it to people 30 and under b/c they wouldn't understand the issues here..
5,A gift of hope,"I've loved all of Robin's Glenbrooke series, but this is now my favorite. It's a great gift of hope to anyone who has felt the joy seep away over her married years. ""Wildflowers"" will awaken your heart."
2,"POORLY packaged by Amazon. I received it with shattered glass, then the replacement was broken too.","The gold frame looked nice, but when I received it the glass was completely shattered (and that shattered glass scraped up the frame). It was so poorly wrapped by amazon. Loose thin bubble wrap (not tightly fitting the product, not taped shut, and tiny bubbles... should have been the big bubbles.) It had a few air pouches in the box, but not enough to protect it. The backing/easel fell out of the frame and the glass was shattered. They could have prevented this. I ordered different color frame at the same time (when I ordered the first gold frame here) that came beautifully packaged/protected.I returned it and they sent a replacement... the replacement had the same exact problem, and shattered glass. I did not re-purchase after twice... I asked for a refund."
3,Title is better than story,"Though I like Sylvia Thorpe, on the whole I have to say this is one of her less successful imitations of Georgette Heyer. The story is fairly short, too. Perhaps if it had been more fully developed, it would have suffered less from a comparison to GH. There are some intriguing characters and situations set up here, ones that bear the imprint of the author's own personality. But unfortunately the book is somewhat underwritten, and so they are never fully developed. However, the author is an accomplished enough writer that the story does provide some enjoyable escapism.Sir Greydon Varleigh is a good hero (though with a strange name.) He lacks the harshness or coldness that tend to mark GH heroes, and the overbearing or domineering characteristics that too often mark Sylvia Thorpe heroes. Dione is a nice, determined, intelligent heroine (even if I have a pretty good guess who she is modelled on.) I just wish the story had been filled out a bit more."
5,Great practical advice for fun Mac projects,"Not only does this book tell you a dozen different cool things you can do with your Mac (control appliances, broadcast Internet radio, emulate arcade games, etc.), it goes into detail explaining the nitty-gritty of _how_ to pull off these projects. Mac Toys is full of practical information with specific product recommendations and step-by-step software instructions anyone can follow. I also appreciate the handy references to useful freeware and shareware that might otherwise escape your notice, as well as the coverage of obscure hardware products that are off the radar of most Mac stores. The book is a little pricey, but worth every penny."
5,Excellent Vocabulary Building Book,"If you want to augment or ameliorate your vocabulary, you might want to study this book. I think that it is geared more towards high school students than adults, although the next WordSmart is suitablt for anyone."
3,Disappointment,"If you're considering buying Word Smart + Grammer Smart the Compact Disc Audio Edition, I urge you to look else where for you vocab building needs. The quality of the definitions, illustrations, and word selection is second rate. Many of the words, such as anguish, are elementary. Anyone with good reading skills and experience should avoid this program."
5,What a Treasure!,Were it only available years ago!I left school in the third week of sixth grade and didn't return until a GED test enabled me to start college studying engineering at 23 years of age. A couple of years later as a U.S. army draftee my perfect Verbal/English score of 152 along with my Arithmetic/Reasoning test score of 146 yielded an Army I.Q. of 149; among the top two percent of Mensa members. But it had been won at immense cost in time and effort. Wordsmart provides perhaps 80% of all that is needed for a perfect score; thus much of the benefit of hundreds of books is condensed into one - Wordsmart! I'm ordering from Amazon.com a copy of it for each of the students in my class. It can transform lives!
1,Ugh! Sophomoric.,"I bought this book because I'm trying to develop a more mature, sophisticated vocabulary. I didn't realize this was a book for kids, or that it would be larded with juvenile humor. Ugh! What a disappointment."
4,Great DVD!,"I bought this DVD for my husband, who loves to surf the Great Lakes (Lake Michigan in particular). There aren't too many movies on fresh water surfing, so it was great to see people surfing somewhere other than the ocean. Great DVD for anyone, not just the surfers!"
4,Makes moving away that much easier,"Can't you imagine the sadness of a family moving away from friends? This book conveys the sadness from the point of view of a very clever, and not-so-sad kid who manages to find a way to make her entire family forget their moving sorrows. I won't tell you the plot, but I will say that this book -- along with a can opener -- makes a wonderful going-away gift for the favorite friends you will miss."
4,"An engrossing, yet flawed, portrait of a fascinating man.","The illustrations alone almost make this book worth the price. Yet there are quite a few historical errors that need to be corrected. There are, for example, a few mistakes in the section dealing with the 1889 Johnstown Flood. But the reader can tell that this book was a passion for her, and she should be commended for tackling a difficult subject. It's rarely easy writing objectively about one's ancestors."
2,Frick,"One step above a vanity press endeavor. A family member's gothic tale about the wealthy business tycoon Henry Clay Frick and his two daughters, Martha and Helen. Martha dies in infancy (too many words in this book are spilt on the details of the accidental ingestion of a pin that caused her demise) setting the stage for a psychological drama playing out over decades and apparently worthy of Freud.The great works of art contained in Frick Collection are used here merely to illustrate the strangely introspective, maudlin, or near crazy behavior of this dysfunctional family.Only if you have a very deep need to know about the Frick family should you trouble yourself with this tome."

1,NOT A CHOPPER,"This bike is not a chopper/custom. It something parents buy for there kids to show off around the block. A chopper/custom bike is cut and welded yourself. Or restore and old school krate or schwinn phatom. This so to show with some word play you too and own a ""chopper"" if you have a problem with my view feel free to emial me at [...]"
5,"A ""must-have"" book for practicing ASIC engineers","The book has detailed information on timing issues of ASICs and FPGAs, such as pre and post layout timing analysis. Several comprehensive examples on timing analysis using different available STA tools makes the book a practical guide for verification engineers. The book also covers some RTL coding examples for timing, however it is made solely for timing verification not a book for learning HDL languages, therefore trying to criticize the programming part of the book as in previous review is irrelevant let alone trying to correct spelling."
3,Good but not their best,I'm Sorry But When I Here Suicidal Tendencies I Here Rocky Geogre and his amazing solos get Rocky Geogre back in the band.
2,"I feel like a ""Sui-Sucker""","Mike really got me this time. After putting out what was my top album for 1999 (Freedumb), he comes back with more of the stuff that turned me off of these guys in the early 90's. This really should of been released as an ""Infectious Grooves"" record. Too much funk, not enough punk."
3,No more riffs,"S.T. hasn't had produced an album with any guitar riffs in years (Suicidal for Life). Nothing new on this album. Superior to Freedumb but Cyco seems at a loss for anything original with the current S.T. lineup (which is the same as the Infectious lineup). Is it me or did all this start when Dean Pleasents joined the band(s)? What made S.T. and I.G. so great was their difference, you wanted some hard rock you listen to S.T. You want some Funk rock, you listed to I.G. I'd like to see Rocky back with the band.Go buy Lights...Camera...Revolution for some Suicidal Tendencies."
5,Best Effort in a while by Mike,"This album is definitely one of the best put out by Mike since the 'Art of Rebellion' and 'Groove Family Cyco'. (I've yet to hear Freedumb, though) Just try and sit still while listening to this album... you can't. The title track totally jams! This album is more in the vein of Infectious Grooves, but the songs cover all styles that ST and Mike are capable of. A few of the tracks also have an early punkish edge to them. Make sure to pick up this album. Even if you were disappointed by Mike's other recent releases, this one won't disappoint. (The title track alone makes it worth it)"
3,Room to Breathe - Tiresom,"Have you ever gotten a CD, and it is great for a while, but after you hear it over and over, it get's boring? That's how this CD was.Overall, it was a great CD, the songs show young girls to live for God but with a great, contemerary beat. It's just not good to have JUST this CD, because it will eventually grow tiresome."
2,"Somebody Please Define ""Christian""","What makes this album ""Christian"" and not secular? Is it the absence of trashy lyrics, replaced by themes of self-confidence, self-assurence, and self-praise? My sister plays this all the time and it drives me batty. I love Christian rock when it's quality stuff, but this is not quality. It's not unique and it's not inspiring. We need to stop making stuff that's just a ""notch"" above secular music. We need to stop comparing ourselves to anybody and just write and sing from the heart."
5,Great beginners primer!,"I find that the Weekend Crash Course books are good beginning primers that will help me learn quickly in a structured format. This Windows XP book is exactly what I needed now that I finally have XP running on my computer. I really did not go through the book in a single weekend, but I keep it around for when I need to learn something new or have an interest in new stuff - like figuring out Outlook Express."
5,Bush Pilot Supreme,"""...the rousing story of Bob Reeve, Alaska's first glacier pilot, and one of the tough, salty, adventuring bunch of bush pilots who pioneered Alaska's skies in single-engine planes without communications, navigational aids, or airfields.""""In 1932 when Bob Reeve climbed off a freighter in Valdez, Alaska, he was broke, ill, and without a plane to fly. Today Reeve is running a successful commercial airline through the worst weather in the world along the fog-shrouded Aleutian chain.""""Reeve has made a career of soing the kind of flying that no one else wanted to do, and his exploits have earned him the name 'Half-Bird.'"""
3,For diehard 60s/Frampton fans only!,"If you love BOTH Peter Frampton and late-60s Brit-pop, you'll get into it. Some tunes don't work, but others shine well: ""I Don't Want Our Loving To Die,"" ""Understand Me,"" ""From The Underworld,"" and ""Miss Jones"" among them. Frampton was then, as he is now, a warm, soulful voice. This one goes 50-50, but for the good 50, go for it!"
2,Warning! After reading this book impressionable young kids may feed their dogs chocolate,"I liked this book but in the book the dog, Harold shares that he and one of the kids often share a snack of chocolate. He does say that they aren't supposed to but it could give younger readers the idea that it is okay to feed chocolate to dogs, or their pets in general without knowing or thinking about what could happen if they do. Other than that it is a good story and I like it. It is a good book for fans of the Bunnicula series"
5,Riley's First Grade Review,This was an awesome book. My favorite character is Chester. He is a cat. Chester is funny. Chester reads the newspaper. He gets funny ideas and gets the dog in trouble.
3,An Amusing Animal Adventure Story,"Ages 4-8 yrs. Sort of a long story about some house pets--Harold the dog, Chester the cat, Howie the small dog, and Bunnicula the rabbit--who are worried that someone is trying to break into their humans' house. They talk to each other in the story as they set up guard duty, and then try and solve the mystery of the missing fudge.The story can be a little long for young ones, and there are multiple characters talking on various pages. This can be confusing to children listners if the reader parent/teacher doesn't seperate, or change the characters' voices--there are humans who also have dialoge--so children can easily identify who is talking. But, it's a fun story that ends happily, and if that's not enough, there is a recipe in the back of the book for Mr. Monroe's Famous Fudge!"
4,Fun Trivia,"I purchased this game for my family. We had a fun time playing it during Thanksgiving, but like another person said ""most of the stuff is from the East Coast"". We've not heard of a lot of it. Didn't much care for the layout of the board. Seems like there should be more of the triangles in order to get the special cards. We started to use the ""roll again"" spots as those spaces too in order to speed up the game. We ended up quiting the game and just asking the questions to see if anyone could get the answer. Fun game, but could take a long time to finish."
3,Like Any Other Trivial Pursuit Game,"The cover of the box makes the game seem appealing because of the American Pop Culture Food Icons that most of us know and love. However, once we began the game, we quickly learned that many of the questions involve favorite snacks from all over the world. Unless you are well-traveled, these questions about foreign snacks make it difficult to attempt making an educated guess. Needless to say, the teens that were playing became bored, and frankly, so did we adults. To me, this game is the same as any other trivial pursuit game. Some questions are fun to answer, but when too many of the questions are difficult to answer you quickly lose interest and simply end the game before it's time."
1,Too Difficult,"The questions are more about the manufacturers of snacks, etc. than the sweets themselves. We knew the answer to very few questions and it got kind of boring after awhile."
3,expired coupons / age should be adults (not teen to adult),"I purchased this game new in December 2011. It was cute to have coupons for snack items in the game box but unfortunately, they expired in 2010. That was a disappointment.Also, this game is rated teen to adult. My 14 & 19 year old were able to answer very few questions. The majority of the questions are more appropriate for people over the age of 35."
3,"good game, but it ends to quick","The game questions are interesting and fun. However, the game per the directions ends way to quickly. My two teens and I played it, they agreed with me its fun but end too quickly. We implemented our own directions just to keep the game in play longer."
5,fun,"Love this game! Bought it for my mother, as she is a food channel fanatic! The game is fun for all generations of our family, but there are some questions that may be challenging for the younger as it features a lot of candies and foods that are very rare or are no longer around. On the other side of that argument, its educational as well in a fun way."
3,Thin and soft.,"This is not a heavy, thick, durable good. If yo plan to use this as a cap to keep your hose clean, it should be fine. If you plan to use it to keep water from escaping, don't forget to add a washer, and don't get your hopes too high. This should be used as a 3 season cap for temporary use on a garden hose. Do not use this as a permanent cap."
2,Leaks,"Does not fit properly and continues to leak. Looks like I'm headed out to Lowes after all! Caveat: not 100% sure if this is the problem, or what I'm fitting it to."
4,For those who don't know.....,"Many folks have negative things to say about others. No matter what u say about Dionne, you must know that the girl can ssssssiiiiiinnnnggg!Althought the tracks selected were ok, the one complaint I have is that the album ""Finder of Lost Loves"" was totally ignored. How could u have a complilation of Warwick's Arista years and not include ""Love Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" or ""Finder of Lost Loves"".....(even if album sales were poor..its about quality..thats why its called ""The Best of ...."" or ""The Greatest..."")Anyway, I liked this album and loved ""Walk Away""! Go ahead, buy it!"
5,"Great Talent, wonderful CD!!!!!!!!",Dionne Warwick has one of the most beautiful voices and the I also like the duets they have included on this CD!!!!!!!
1,WISH I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS,"After a through review of this album, there can be but one conclusion- this ain't very good. Ms. Warwick's vocal stylings have always been poor and the song selections here are even poorer. The thiness of Ms. Warwick's voice is only outweighed by her less than appropiate ability to carry a tune. One must really concentrate for even a smattering of music that can even pass as average on this set. That sad thing is, Ms. Warwick probably could not do any better. If you love music, please stay away from this one."
5,You don't know what you are missing!!!,"I can't believe no one has anything to say about this album. I got it when it came out, it looks like it now has a different cover. It is a powerful debut album, with something for everyone. It blends rap, rock, dance, r&b in a way no one had done before. I hate rap, and I love this album. It is not full of the twisted hate issues of rap, it is not the teeny bopper themes of so much rock, it is the soul searching (with some fun and self-humor thrown in) that only people like The The, Haddaway, Sylvester, Laurie Anderson, and Peter Gabriel (who tends to be more morose), David Byrne, Brian Ferry, Eurythmics, and Anne Clark can do. (Ok, there's others). They all have their own styles, and Snap! has theirs. If you appreciate the artists for what they say as much as the music they put out, you need to have this album!"
2,Snap World Power... Don't Believe the Hype,"Only 1 track out of 8 is worthwhile. Which is ""The Power"". The other songs were a waste of time. I got caught up in the hypeback in 1990. Finally clearing out my old collection & selling iton Ebay in 2005. Thank goodness for MP3."
3,The power is the best dance song... perhaps ever!,But the rest of Snap's material is just ok. Were it not for The Power i'd probably rate this as a 2 star disc
1,What a JOKE!! Doesn't even deserve a 1/4 star!!,"There are 2 basic tracks - that's it - on this ridiculous CD.I literally burst out laughing when I listened to this CD's samples! Everyone (mostly Native NORTH American) with whom Ihave sent the link to, of this CD, has really gotten a belly laugh out of it!!The ""chants"" aren't too much at issue. Rather, it's the ""DRUM Corps"" behind them! Whoever put out this CD is absolutelyinsulting to ALL Native NORTH American peoples!"
5,Sketches of Native America CD!,I got this CD for a friend as an early Christmas gift & although I didnt get the chance to listen to it entirely but my friend did & she loved it!
5,Best DVI Cable for the price,I purchased this cable for my LCD moniter all I can say is Awsome looks a lot nicer from the other cable I was using. I can see the very big difference is in gameplay very quick no lag time on video response and I can finally use my Moniter to its full potential I recommed this product to anyone.
5,Bill Nelsons early years,"I bought this as a replacement for a vinyl copy. This is his 3rd album, and shows Be Bop Deluxe as a 3 pieced band. Wild and wonderful. Guitar everywhere. Get yourself a copy,. you won't be sorry"
4,Futurama,"I believe it is a very good effort for a second album. Excellent song writing attributes to the overall great sonic output on this disc. Nelson is a music creating machine that is ever evolving. I only gave it four stars because I feel Axe Victim is a tall order to top on a second album. I love all of BBD material, as a rule."
5,Caught Red Handed,"This book gives insight on how to detect fraud in a nonprofit organization. Postives/Pluses, this book tells how to detect fraud in different types of people and places, what to do to deter fraud, and specific examples of fraud in well known organizations. Negatives/Minuses alot of the information is presented in the same format text and bullets and alot of the information is redundant. However, overall the book is an excellent book to keep a nonprofit from turning into a for profit organization for the thieves."
2,The speakers are nothing special.,"Bought these speakers for my boat and they seem to be just average speakers that requires more space then regular speakers. After installing these speakers I noticed they are not shielded so now my compass is off. For the price I paid for them and these being marine speakers I would have thought they would be shielded. The sound is average as well as compared to my much cheaper JBL marine speakers which are shielded. I have had a good experience with bose but ""better sound through research"" does not really apply to these."
4,Bose costs a copple of bucks but are worth it,"Used these under the soffits/overhang for outdoor speakers to have music on the deck. Sounds and looks good. Installation in this unique case was tricky. Happy, Happy, Happy."
3,Not very happy at the moment.,"I have one complaint which is the reason for my average ratings above....I mounted these into the center console of my bay boat. After making a 60 mile trip down the interstate, averaging 70 mph, I arrived at my destination, whereupon I found that one of the speaker covers had come off. I checked the remaining cover and only then did I realize that that they do NOT as tight as they should to the speaker; without exagerating, the fit is extremely loose. I'm not happy in the least about this. I'm now going to have to contact Bose for a replacement. This really pisses me off."
4,How to build an e-Learning environment,"This new book of Badrul Khan is a very good starting point to anyone who is trying to figure out how to build an e-Learning environment. Trough its several chapters the different dimensions of such an environment are well explained and really detailed. The inclusion of various checklists represents also an important added value to the book. The last chapter regarding evaluation issues was crucial to me as I'm currently researching this topic.I also recommend the book ""e-Learning Quick Checklist"" from the same author where an even deeper perspective on those checklists is presented.In conclusion this book is a good value for money and an excellent option for a newcomer in this field."
4,good but short,DA Carson was one of the first to step into the minefield of the KJV only debate -- but debate is probably the wrong word since debate implies that logic applies and often that is not the case. An easy to read introduction to the issues.
1,Scholarly?,More like a plea for money. if you like to buy books to keep warm with or just start the fire buy this book. Why would anyone want to take you faith away from the Word of God? These books will state all versions are the Word of God so why take faith away in the King James Bible? They want your money. Dr. Ruckman has said many times keep your money READ THE KING JAMES BIBLE not my books...
3,as good a defense of the modern versions as one will get,"Mr. Carson does a good job of defending the modern versions. Unfortunately, in order to do so, he must misrepresent the KJB only side and make it seem like Mr. Ruckman and Ms. Riplinger are actually representative of the KJB only position, which they are not. He ignores the scholarship of men like D. A. Waite, D. O. Fuller, Edward F. Hills, etc. to focus on two weirdos, Ruckman and Riplinger. Of course, since Biblical preservation dictates the KJB only position, since the Textus Receptus is the vast majority text, it is necessary to distort the KJB only position to attack it. However, if you want to defend the modern versions, this is as good as you'll get."
3,Not the color I wanted,A little disappointed. The picture showed a grey mouse with red pom pom ears and red tail which is the ONLY color mouse my cat likes. I'm not sure if there was a disclaimer saying that colors may vary. It is possible I did not see it. I just wish I got the color that was shown in the product picture.
5,Very well explained...,"I just used this yesterday to make the unstructured roman blinds and I was impressed that the explanations were so clear. Lays out what measurements you need and provides very clear instructions. I sew every few years or so, I am a novice and I could follow this book easily. Highly recommend it."
2,Burning Plastic,"I bought this new a year ago. I also did the mail-order option (found in the packaging) for a ac adaptor ($10 from GE). Installation on my Mac was flawless, no drivers needed. I was not able to connect all my USB2.0 devices through it, but I suspect that to be a limitation of how much data and power can pass through a computer's usb port, not the devices fault. It worked well for a year. I only connect my mouse and keyboard through this hub. Last week there was this terribly strong burning plastic smell at my desk; it was this device and it was very hot. I tested the product without the ac adaptor and it still got hot. I let it cool for a week and tested it again; it still got hot and smelled. It's in my garbage. I'll get a different brand next time.(If anyone is curious, the ac adaptor sent by GE was a Ktec 5.0V positive, and I would rate it 5 stars)"
3,Donkey Kong 64 book not that good.,"This was a pretty cool book for someone who likes donkey kong like I do, but I found the players guide a lot more informative for this game. The details weren't directly based around the game. The illustrations were good but that's only because they were taken from the game. You should only buy this if you love seeing DK's mug and info about the story of Donkey Kong 64."
4,NASB Black Leather Bible,"I think this is a wonderful Bible and am enjoying it greatly. I was however, surprised to find that it is not a red-letter edition. I was not even aware that there is an edition without Christ's words in red. Other than that, this is the best Bible I have ever had. Thank you,"
4,a good cook can use a break too!,"This is a great book for those who DO know how to cook. I love to cook and am quite good at it, but with 2 little ones, time is of the essence. I didn't want to give up 'pretty' food for 'quik' food...this book is good for meeting both those objectives. I am going to give it to a friend that doesn't like to cook. I think she will like it as much as I do because it has simple,fast and contemporary food selections."
4,Do you like fish?,"If you like fish or egg recipes, you'll like this book. If you like beautiful, minimalistic text/book design, you'll also like this book. Great resource for creating classy foods with just a few ingredients, especially for entertaining small crowds (even a special date). Very NYC in taste. Definitely a book for the 20-something or bachelor(ette). I've tested a few recipes so far, and they've all been good. Although the graphic designer in me is more impressed by the illustration and layout."
3,What the heck is it???,"I read the product description, I read the reviews, and I still have no idea what this part is, or how it is used, except one commentator said it is needed for the hand shower. Really, a better product description should be integrated by Amazon."
4,Twins extended at their (almost) best...,"This CD was basically just a filler to get the Twins out of their Arista contract... and it shows. Aside from the 1988 remix of ""In the Name of Love"", and a previously unavailable mix of ""King For a Day""... there is nothing else on this CD that a die-hard Twins fan has not already heard. In fact, most of the mixes were shortened from their original incarnations.That being said... if you are a fan of the Twins and their ability to hypnotize you with their undeniably catchy hooks and melodies, this CD is right up your alley."
4,A good collection but not all of their best mixes,"This is a good general collection of the T-Twins 12 inch mixes. For some reason, they are edited from their original form, which is annoying to those of us familiar with the longer versions. Standout tracks are ""Lies"", ""The Gap"", ""Hold Me Now"", ""Love on Your Side"" and ""In the Name of Love '88"". It would have been nice to see the superior remixes of ""We Are Detective"", ""Watching"" and ""Sister of Mercy"" on here instead of the bland mixes of ""You Take Me Up"", ""King for A Day"" and ""Get That Love"". But those songs were bigger hits in the US."
2,Not good enough,"I bought this CD expecting the cuts listed on the back, as they were originally. I missed the bit about ""mixes"", or didn't understand it. I don't remember. Some of the remixed stuff is dreck, and most of the rest of it is not memorable. In my opinion, there was only one track on this CD which was good. I'm getting rid of my copy."
5,Keep moving out into THE GAP!,"Unique collection of Thompson Twins remixes will satisfy or disatisfy, but it definitely holds my favorite extended mix of THE GAP without a doubt, and once you get hooked on this version, the others sink into the 80's sea. Nuf said."
3,Strange Dayz,"The million dollar question is, does one really need dance mixes of Thompson Twins music. I found the mixes on this bizarre and a bit obnoxious. There are extended instrumental parts of each song and some dubs and echos here and there. I would actually rather hear just the original versions of Thompson Twins hits, but I found this cd at a thrift store for a buck. It's one step away from being thrown out the window of my car on the freeway, but I guess I would still like to have it so I have a copy of some of their hits."
5,Absolutely breathtaking,"These guys, Thompson Twins were the best the 80's had to offer.Tracks like 'Hold me now' & 'Doctor Doctor' are just fantastic"
4,unbelievable price...140.00 shipped.,"mixer works great. the top of mixer moves just a hair when mixing dough, not sure if its supposed to.... looks brand new for a refurbished product.. only a few small scratches in the bowl its self."
4,Kitchen Aid,I've owned a Kitchen Aid since 1977 and it's still going strong. They are the same price as back then but getting this one at the price I did was great.I only give it 4 stars although because when we opened the box the ring around the bottom of the head fell off. I'm sure this is a miner flaw as it goes right back on. I've always loved a Kitchen Aid in my kitchen.
5,"Amazing value, great product, limited warranty","I ordered this mixer recently as a Christmas gift for my mother, who currently only has a hand-held mixer. I've been shopping around for a KitchenAid, but the sky-high price kept me from purchasing. When I found this one on Amazon I was very happy. I ordered before Dec 17th so I received an additional $25 off my purchase. These are $299 new, and I got mine for $125 after the Amazon rebate. That's a total savings of $175! However, you only get a 6-month warranty instead of 1 year, and no pouring shield (a $25 value). Still it's an incredible deal.When I received my mixer I checked it out thoroughly. It has the slightest scuff that you can only see when the light hits it just right. 99.9% of the time it looks absolutely perfect from any angle, I couldn't be happier. I'm sure mom will be happy too. Hopefully she won't be shopping around and see this review before Christmas!"
3,Not so happy,The mixer was a good mixer. But I bought one that was reconditioned. That was my mistake. I should have spent the money and purchased the new one not the reconditioned. I've had it a year now and its not as powerful as it use to be. I will be buying a new one soon but it will not be reconditioned.
2,Artisan refurbished,"I bought it with augsaver and free shipping a deal!The unit is arrived very fast, in great shape, just a few cosmetic dents. I was surprised that the head wasn't ajusted, so if I had run it with a hook , I would have scratched badly the bowl, but it's easy to fix.otherwise, every things OK."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this mixer for my daughter-in-law. She lives in another town and had received the mixer for Christmas baking. I went to visit and I realized when I saw the mixer that it is not what I thought I had ordered. I thought I had ordered the same mixer that I have, which is the lift up model and not the tilt back. My mixer is much more powerful and has bigger attachments. In my opinion, this mixer is not the five quart, but the 41/2 quart model with a 5 quart bowl. The mixer I purchased for my daughter-in-law tilts back, while the true 5 quart mixer has a control that lifts the attachment up from the bowl.So anyone out there that wants the bigger more powerful ""true"" 5 quart mixer, this is not it. I realize that I should have been paying more attention to what the mixer looked like instead of realing that it was called a ""5"" quart. So buyer beware on this item. It truly is not what they are calling it."
1,Refurbished? I don't think so!,"I recieved my order promptly and when I took it out of the box this is what I found. The bowl looked like it had been used for years. When I turned it on it made a nasty grinding sound and the rotary mixing motion didn't make it once around. This thing wasn't even close to working at all, much less reconditioned. When I went to lean the head back the black switch that locks it down fell off. It was cracked in half. Though I have read some positive reviews, I don't believe that Kitchenaid looks these mixers over well enough before re-selling. The one bright star in the whole mess was the relative ease and helpfullness of Amazon's Return process. Nothing out of my pocket and I should get the refund soon. Don't get your hopes up to high with this one folks."
5,Excellent,"Though it is factory reconditioned this is an excellent mixer. We have been using it for nearly an year and we had no problems what so ever reported by other buyers. If you are not a heavy duty user this is an excellent buy, we paid $120 after the rebates."
5,Excellent Value,This mixer looks Brand new and works flawlessly. You cannot tell it has been reconditioned. It has already been put through its paces making dozens of cakes and huge batches of icing. Definately go for this over the[...] price you will find it for in other outlets.
3,Quality control problems,"I've played with the 4 quart and never had a problem, but the first 5 quart I got was dead on arrival. Wouldn't even start up. After an exchange, we got a unit that made a weird noise on the first 2 speeds which, and it wobbles horribly when set to a high speed using the dough hook."
1,Good while it lasted.,KitchenAid Artisan mixer is a great product. I will not buy a reconditioned one again. The reconditioned mixer lasted only 2 1/2 years. I do not consider that to be acceptable. My Sunbeam mixer lasted 30 years (inherited from my mother) before I broke the housing. The replacement Sunbeam mixer was still good after 15 years when I gave it away and bought the more powerful KitchenAid. I now have to replace the KitchenAid after less than 3 years. Not good.
2,Two stars for Two uses before it broke....,"Received my dream mixer very fast--refurbished looked so affordable ...unfortunately, it made great mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving but broke while making my first batch of Christmas cookies-- peanut butter cookies...so it never even received a workout. The locking mechanism pops out as soon as I turn on the mixer. I pretty much consider this purchase a $150 bowl of mashed potatoes. Spoke to customer service yesterday and sent customer service the details of the invoice as they requested--have not heard back or even been acknowledged that they had received the copy of my invoice. I'm not feeling very hopeful this will be a pleasant experience.If I do hear back from them and if they do request I ship it back, my refurbished mixer has just gone up to the price of a new sale one...my advice is to buy one new."
1,Burnt up,"This mixer worked fine for cake mixes and light white breads but the first time I made a whole wheat bread it burnt up, stinking up my kitchen and leaking black grease into to dough. I am returning the first one I got to see if this is just a fluke or if the legendary KitchenAid is just not what I have heard. My $40 food processor can handle whole wheat bread better than this machine can."
1,Kitchen Aid Artisan Mixer 7 month life,"Purchased RRK150WH reconditioned May 28, 2007. Worked great until it died this morning (Jan 5, 2007). Obviously a heavy duty product, but gives me very serious reservations about durability, since I've used it very little and very lightly."
4,Best for the price.,"Overall, i am very happy with the product as I bought it mainly to help me knead roti dough.It came in new condition no scratches whatsoever.Machine works fine, it has container which is very easy to clean but it is a little too deep.So when we knead our dough which is every other day, it does not mix well in first few minutes.But I would consider this a minor flaw.Kitchenaid has made my life so much easier and happier.I love it and would recommend buying this product to anybody."
1,Too much art and history! Little on sights to see!,"I must say I was excited when I got this DVD, but after watching it I found myself trying to stay awake during most of it. It you're an art lover or history lover, this video is for you as it goes into great depth going over the history of Hungary and of detailing the country's art. I thought I bought a tourism DVD, not a history DVD. If you're looking for a video to show you what to see and what to do while in Budapest, this video had very little to offer. I was disappointed quite honestly and would not recommend it to anyone (unless history and art is what you're looking for)."
3,Introductory Background on Egypt -,"The books begins with a very, very basic history and readers learn that though pyramids typically took about 20 years to build, Egypt's pyramid-building phase probably lasted less than 20 years. Egyptians also developed the 365-day calendar, and scribes existed back at least around 2,500 B.C. (papyrus served as paper). Egyptian language evolved to incorporate about 700 characters, then added thousands more before becoming cursive. Women were able to inherit property and attain rank in religious circles, possibly also in government as well. (Cleopatra was queen.) The book also provides brief coverage of Egyptian gods and religion.Most of the text is accompanied by carvings or some other artifact."
4,The Great Book,"The book contains a lot of detailed photographs and illustrations of Egypt's rulers, gods and goddesses, how the peope lived, artifacts, and many other photographs relating to Egypt. The reader will see detailed pictures of the pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, animals, tombs of different rulers, utensils, pottery, jewelry, and many others. A history of this fascinating civilization, from ancient to modern Egypt, is included, as well as reconstructions of tombs, an index for fast information. This book, Splendors of Egypt is for everyone to own."
2,Good book if you have no clue about chaos magic...,"Okay, I am probably too advanced for this book, having already read all of Phil Hine, Kenneth Grant, and Peter Carroll. I would only recommend it if you are very new to chaos magic, so new that you don't know who Austin Spare is at all, or the basic tenents of chaos magic--which are study all systems, take what works for you, and hit the delete key on what doesn't. Chaos magic is wonderful, it allows you to be free to practice whatever gets results (don't you wish everything in this world was that simple?). I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who is already advanced through at least 1 magical system, it is strictly a beginner's book."
4,An excellent introductory book,"This is an excellent introductary book on chaos magick. It clearly outlines the history, terminology and philosophies and commonatlities found among chaotes.It explains and dispells many assumptions often made about chaos magick which I found interesting, such as how it is sometimes percieved as being of the 'left hand path'.If you're new to chaos magick, or curious to know more, this is the book to pick up. If you're more experienced, it likely won't have anything new to offer, but may be worth the read to authoritatively recommend it to people who ask you 'What is chaos magick?'"
2,Understanding Chaos Magic,"I found the book to be a bit slim for the price. But, I did find the chaos science information written in plain languge useful and informative. The maps detailing the home neighborhood of AOS were interesting, as were the author's personal antecdotes on her experiences with magic. I'd personally like to hear from more female Choas Magicians! But, if the reader is looking for an excellent book on Chaos magic, read anything by Phil Hine."
1,Understanding What??,"This book is ""Kaa-Kaa"", Iwould not recommend this book to any magickian, wheather just starting out or advanced!!"
2,Almost teaches you what you need to know.,"I bought this book mostly to learn how to customize Contact forms. This book gives you about half the info you need. Then you hit a brick wall. I spent hours searching newsgroups and web sites to fill in the other half. There are a few simple things the author could have added so the book was actually valuable instead of incredibly frustrating. For example, the book shows you how to customize a form. Great. But then the book neglects to tell you how to apply that form to existing Contacts."
3,Refrence Book,"Nothing special its a refrence book, a bit wordy at times I think just to use up paper and make the book look bigger. You can keep it on the shelf for refrence but don't try to read it from cover to cover you might go blind."
2,Flag,"The flag just did not hold up at all. First day on the lake and it fell apart in the wind. Very disappointing for the price. The stitching needs to be stronger and the hem needs to be larger. The pole and clips are fine, but would not buy this flag for a boat. Need to find one that is made better."
4,Bought for my boats lite mast. Works great,Worth the money and well made. Holds up well in foul weather. Can be used on smaller boat lite masts or cables.
5,You know how good he is?,"This guy's so good, that you can, much like with Ralph Wiggum on the Krusty Show, pinpoint the exact moment when a character's heart breaks. Try it! Works every time!"
3,None,"These stories are great. But I was forced to read it for my english class and we over analyis each story. If I had read it myself and not for a class, it would have been amazing. The symbols and themes are unforgetable! James Joyce made a whole new language writing these short stories. It's a must read classic!"
3,Bittersweet,"James Joyce is a talented writer. His discriptions of characters bring them alive, and through them I got a sense of everyday life in Dublin. The stories of these characters are deep, and Joyce also brings their problems and struggles to life. Joyce deserves credit for the his sentence structuring skills and his subtle imagery. However, I struggled reading this book. I'm not familiar with Irish culture, or with James Joyce's works. My reading pace was slow and I never really got into a good flow with The Dubliners. Although I enjoyed some of the stories, I got bored with the repetitive themes of them. Maybe I'm not cultured enough to fully enjoy classical books, but this just got boring after awhile. The good news the last story, The Dead, is a terrific piece of literature. I recommend this book if you are looking for well-written literature that doesn't have any surprises."
3,Beautifully written but underwhelming,"I enjoyed four of the fifteen stories in this book immensely. The others were great for their prose, depiction of people at certain junctures in their life, and reflection of Dublin at the turn of the Century, but otherwise not compelling.""The Dead,"" his most enduring and evocative piece of short fiction, did nothing for me. I loved A Little Cloud, Couterparts, A Painful Case, and Eveline.I read the Barnes&Noble; Classic edition. The maps at the beginning of each story added no value.After reading this book I'm ready for some contemporary fiction."
4,"Nice, difficult and surprising","I had to read this book for my Exams Literature English and I have to say you read the book in one time without breathing... In case of all that short stories you get an idea of the feelings and thinkings of the Dubliner people, and that's the thing I liked of this book. I hope: so do you!"
3,"Great for Narratology studies, but otherwise mediocre","Like many, I had to read this book as part of the requirements for my freshman course on narrative fiction in college. I was not impressed. Sure, for analysis on character portrayal techniques and center of consciousness theory, Dubliners is a useful and convenient tool; but as an example of brilliant writing, it falls very short. The fact of the matter is that some stories are better than others and to judge the book as a single work is a grievous mistake. It's surprizing there has not been a formal study of the many flaws in this book."
2,don't waste your time,"perhaps you enjoy reading James Joyce. that being the case, ignore what i am about to say lest you take offense...James Joyce is the biggest joke. nothing but a drunken Irishman, he writes both predictably and AGITATINGLY. his diction bothers me and his language frustrates me more.these stories, all written about Joyce's passion for Ireland do capture the lifestyle, i'll give the man that much, and he does utilize his poetic styles, but overall, i can't stand reading him. but let's be honest here, he needed more than some eye-catching words to attract and keep my attention."
1,Chinatown,"Arguably the most boring book ever written, Joyce excels here in causing premature napping in most of his readers. If he's not describing the cobblestone archways or the giant marshmallow who lives down the street, he is trying to convince us that Dublin is in Ireland. I'm not biting."
4,Table of Contents needs work,"This review is for the free kindle version.This is obviously a great work by the master James Joyce; no doubt about that. And this version is free. So that's great. I only want to inform people about the table of contents. While there is a table of contents, with the default font size on the Kindle you cannot see the last few short stories (Grace, The Dead) in the TOC to link to them directly, and to my knowledge there is no way to scroll through to the next page of the TOC. At first, I thought these stories were missing, but they are just hidden. One work around is to set the font size to small while browsing the TOC, then you can see the last few links. Other than that, this version is fine."
5,Favorite Short Fiction Collection,"Joyce is a fiction master, but his longer works aren't the most approachable reads. This collection of short stories, however, is both perfectly executed and relatively easy to unpack for most readers, even as young as adolescents. It's perfect for use as a teaching tool to illustrate the fundamentals of character development and plot. Above and beyond all that--it's just a fantastic read."
4,"Liked it so much, I read it again.","Little snippets of life among the Irish working class. I read this book for the first time in my early 20's. Although I enjoyed it then, I liked it even more ten years later. This is one of those books that you appreciate more when you have some life experiences to compare it with.Good strong believable characters and a subtle writing style that let's you draw your own conclusions."
5,Great Stories,"Great writing - enthralling, captivating, etc. I can't give enough praise to this work. If you haven't read it, you should."
3,A Curious Collection of Tales,"In this famous collection of short stories, James Joyce gives us a glimpse into the Ireland of his time. The stories are well-written, and deal with themes concerning most aspects human nature. One problem that I found, however, is that he never clearly portrayed some of the character's deeds as either good or bad. I suppose he wanted the reader to make his own decision, but it left me wondering what Joyce's intent was.With all of this said, it is a book that many will enjoy, and one that supplies us with a relatively clear view of the past. For these reasons, I highly recommend this book.---Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"
4,Frustratingly short short stories,"I had given up on James Joyce after finding ""Ulysses"" too murky and disorienting. When I mentioned this to a young handsome literature student in a Dublin pub, he suggested I try ""Dubliners"" instead. When I got back home I checked a copy out of the library and found it hard to believe this collection of stories was written by the same man who confounded me before. I found each story almost instantly engaging (except the one about the election; too far removed from my modern American experience, I guess), and most seemed to end abruptly. This may be why another reviewer wrote that the stories had no climax, but I simply wanted more. I'm here on Amazon to buy a copy because I still want more.So did Joyce write these stories and then hit the Absinthe before writing ""Ulysses""? Or am I thinking of Oscar Wilde...?"
5,One of the world's greatest story- collections,"Burgess is one of the great Joyce critics .His appreciation of Joyce's linguistic exuberance is echoed in his own writing.'Dubliners' is the seed out of which 'Ulysses' will grow. It is one of the great story collections of all time i.e. The stories are composed as a whole, as a single composition . Each one of them has its own place in Joyce's exploration and revelation of his native city , of the soul of mankind."
5,speaks to the soul,James Joyce has a way of stringing words together that brings life into his characters and tells poignant stories in just a few pages. He does this throughout Dubliners and his stories are like a string of pearls bound into a book.
4,Imminently readable,"Many people, associating Joyce with Ulysses and dense, difficult writing, avoid his other works as well. That's a mistake. Introduce yourself to The Dubliners, a series of unrelated stories about the people of the great city. It's imminently readable, enjoyable, and is the best way to begin to take a dive into the writing of one of the 20th Century's greatest writers. Then go on to The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man - and soon enough you may even find yourself actually reading Ulysses!Go ahead. Do yourself a favor. You won't regret it."
2,"No, I'M sorry!","SUCH a good title, and with cover art by Mary Fleener and a blurb from Beth Lisick (fellow Manic D author, but still..) this seemed right up my street, but some of these performance pieces just don't stand up on the page. Memo to publishers: the difference between poetry and stand-up is stand-up you want to hear once, poetry you want to read again. But I don't think I'm the target demographic here (sigh)"
5,truely inspriational,I have been watching growing up gotti from the first minute it aired. I love the gottis so when I heard he was coming out with a book I imeadiatly ordered it off the internet so that the day it came out I would get it. I came home from school and It was on my door step the next day around the same time I had read this book from cover to cover. I'm not much of a reader but i couldnt put it down. Today Is my 2nd day on this diet and I am happy about myself. Strugglng with weight as a teenager is not easy. I tried multiple diets but couldnt find one that I could actally help me. I really and truely think that this will work! Also like other diet books it didnt have all those long words or things I couldnt understand. In this book the terms are simple and I can understand it. Frank if your reading this I want you to kno that Its great how you are helping lots of people and I just adore you!
2,He fails to mention how he truly lost weight,"The author of this book was just arrested for drug posession. Diet and exercise, or was there something more?Lies and scandals."
4,Good for teenagers with weight problems,"A very quick read, with basic weight loss tips. Very encouraging for young people with weight problems. The author is very open with his feelings and his difficulties dealing with the pressures of being a teen and how that added to his weight. Good guide."
1,Great movie BAD copy,"This is a great movie but the DVD copy looks like a very well worn VHS tape. The color is faded, and blurry. Too bad, they had a good one but sold us garbage."
4,disappointed it isn't hazelnut CREAM decaf,"The picture shows hazelnut CREAM decaf coffee, but I received plain ole hazelnut decaf. The hazelnut decaf flavor is fine. I'm not sure there'd even be a taste difference, but I was really looking forward to experiencing the hazelnut cream flavor."
3,A little weak,"This coffee is good, but a little weak. I've made it on both settings, but it doesn't seem to matter, it's still weaker then I would like. I'm still in search of the perfect cup of flavored decaf with a rich bold flavor."
2,Wrong coffee,I have always been happy with Green Mountain Coffee. However the last 2 times I have ordered Hazelnut Cream Decaf I don't get what I ordered. I get boxes of Hazelnut Decaf instead. I needed the coffee so I didn't waste time to return it so I don't know how Amazon would have handled the return. Hopefully they will get on the ball with this and send correct coffee!!
3,SANTINI,"Very good. Natalia has a fine feminine touch. Elisso (a woman, by the way)is rather cold, specially in the Chopin. Soud is acceptable, although a little close."
1,One good song on the entire album.,"There is a great song on this album. Every other song is horrific!! Seriously, I love all genres of blue grass, but this album stinks overall!"
4,"Underrated, and worth picking up for Elton fans....","This is one of Elton's most underrated albums. It has at least 3 tracks that are classic Elton. The single, Little Jeannie, is a beautiful ballad, and one of Elton's best songs from the 1980's. But two of the three colloborations with Bernie Taupin are the best songs on the album. Chasing the Crown and White Lady White Powder (yes, about cocaine) are fantastic songs, energetically performed by Elton John and his band. Satorial Eloquence is an excellent number as well, but doesn't have the biting wit that Chasing and White Lady have. Not surprisingly, Satorial was not co-written by Bernie Taupin. While the other songs pass from passable to forgettable, the four I mentioned make this album worth seeking out for Elton devotees."
5,Track Info on This Item,Track Title1. Chasing The Crown2. Little Jeannie3. Sartorial Eloquence4. Two Rooms At The End Of The World5. White Lady White Powder6. Dear God7. Never Fall In Love Again8. Take Me Back9. Give Me The Love
4,VERY GOOD!,"Every song is very good! I like this album more than Captain Fantastic or Jump Up. Songs sounds like Elton is tired from everything. It sounds like he didnt want to create a hit album. Little Jeannie is very sweetie song. I always like to hear this album when I become tired of great songs. This is interesting album because it has everything:pop(Sartorial Eloquence),rock(Chasing the Crown),country(Take Me Back)and disco(Give Me The Love). Every song has the same quality."
3,Fans can never be objective..,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Elton was starting to move away from pop disco with this release and two classic tracks, ""Little Jeannie"" and ""Sartorial Eloquence"" are enough to push this otherwise lackluster recording to 3 stars."
2,One interesting album,"After his 1979 disco Lp,""Victim of Love"",I expected something more Eltonish from my beloved EJ.Interestingly,we got a mixed bag boasting gems like love song LITTLE JEANNIE and the confessionals WHITE POWDER and CHASING THE CROWN while also featuring mediocre tunes such as DEAR GOD & NEVER GONNA FALL IN LOVE AGAIN.Elton's voice is at its best,yet there is a sense of tiredness in the performing and in the arrangements.Not a bad album,yet far from a classic."
2,Mediocre at best,"This is Elton Johns most mediocre album. It's not bad enough to be bad, but definatly not good enough to be good. It's just THERE. Anyway, there's some decent stuff to be heard. Chasing The Crown has some good electric guitar work on it. Sartorial Eloquence is a good song with a catchy chorus. White Lady White Powder is good, if not depressing hearing Elton sing about the start of his drug problems (that came to a head and almost killed him in 1990). Never gonna fall in love again is pleasant. The rest are totally forgettable. Overall, just a very lightweight mediocre album with some nice bits. Better than Jump Up, I think at least."
3,"Some say good,some say bad,you can find out for yourself by","buying it. compared to the previous years victim of love i'd give this an a. as said above, Sartorial Elequence and Little Jeanie have to be the albums best tracks.But wait don't stop there,Two Rooms At The End Of The World ,Dear God and Never gonna fall in love again,approach listenable,and are respectable. The lowest point is probley the closing track. Its worth at least half of the money you pay."
3,Not a favorite,"I bought this video based on the reviews of others, but I found it to be my least favorite of the Holmes mysteries. Holmes and Watson almost missed the boat (a usual excitement build up) but with a result I found hard to take. The original character of Lady Frances Carfax - independent, eccentric - was charming and well acted. However, the episode left me with a negative rather than positive feeling. I think it is one of the darker plots."
3,"Same Old, Same Old, With Few Surprises","Yet another in a seemingly endless procession by academics seeking to fit horror films into some sort of Film Theory niche. In this case they play the 'id' to the Fordist (i.e. Henry Ford) 'superego' of society. The book is almost redeemed by the chapters on the writings of Richard Matheson, Charles Beaumont and Robert Bloch, three masters of horror/sci-fi whose works have been largely forgotten by the mainsteam culture. But is it enough to spend the money for this book? Depends on how much of a collector/scholar one happens to be. That and the size of the wallet.For those who want to experience the joy of these sort of films, I would rather recommend the works of David J. Skal, Bill Warren, and Michael J. Weldon, all of whose works can be purchased on this site."
3,Worth the price?,"I don't know if it is worth the full price. If you can get it on sale, then it's great. They should sell new edition kits, with new cards and dvd's instead of having to buy a whole new game."
1,The makers were lazy. Few multimedia Q's,"The makers were totally lazy when makinf this game. What is the point of having DVD if only a few questions are multimedia and the rest are just text? You might as well just read the questions off a card like the original game.I noticed this during a real game, so later on I just played the DVD questions myself and here is what I found. There are only 3 multimedia (Videos, music, animation, etc) questions for each category. After that there are only text questions, just like on the cards. After about 10 questions in each category it gets even lamer. Rather than even asking a text question, a simple text message comes up and says ""Read a question from a card in the stack"".I gave an overall rating of 1 star. I've been told the ""Scene-It"" series is much better, so i'm going to get one of those next time."
1,"Be careful, may not be what it seems","This looks like an exact copy of the same book from the Gutenberg Project. Problem is, the .mobi version from Gutenberg doesn't include any of the maps -- which really are terrific. The maps *can* be found in the HTML version on the Gutenberg site, however."
1,No Maps!,"Whoever was responsible for preparing this Kindle edition neglected to include the maps! In some cases, the failure to include graphics can be excusable, but an atlas without maps?"
1,No maps,"I was very excited about this books, but there are no maps! What a very big disappointment. WHy aren't there any?"
4,Cool,I chose this book because i like this stuff. I don't like having to do this review though. But i do like this book.
1,This is not an atlas. It's not even an almanac,"This is called an atlas, but it's not. It lists maps but contains none. If you want some archaic spellings, it might be a little useful, but you can get that from a good dictionary. Why is this called an atlas? Why is it even here?"
5,TOP GIFT for all young children,"John Muir's original account of his experience with this dog (in his Travels with Alaska, and separately published 10 or 20 years ago) simply cried out to be retold for children and illustrated in a picture book. Thankfully, Rubay and Canyon have done the two things brilliantly. Rubay's text is a gentle reduction of Muir's own words, preserving his own 19th century phrasings and terms such as chasm, crystal, crevasse, and ice bridge so that their meaning is clear. And Canyon's 25 paintings are fabulously true to life depictions of the Alaskan wilderness in snow and storm, yet each one moves the story. Like all great children's books, it's one the parent wants to read as often as the child wants it read. A book that truly deserves a place in every classroom and on every child's shelf."
2,Not nearly what I expected...,"While I must agree with the other reviewers that the book provided interesting insights into what motivates extreme athletes, the title leads one to believe there would be more explanation and discussion of how these folks prepare physically to do what they do. Instead of training tips, diet or even mental exercises to help the amateur prepare for extreme sports, the book only skims the surface of why extreme athletes do what they do. In trying to cover so much ground, the author fails to even inspire the reader to get outdoors and try one of these sports or to train harder for the sports they might currently be engaged in. Pass this one up and spend the money on a subscription to OUTSIDE magazine, you'll be more satisfied in the long run."
2,Missing parts,The lock would have been very nice if all the parts were in the package. It was missing the stem which is impossible to latch the door without! Wasn't worth the cost of returning so I had to go to Lowe's and purchase another. Would be a great replacement to hold on to for the future if they would send the missing part free of charge. I'll let you kow if THAT happens!
4,"Looks great, but does not fit my door.","This door handle looks great. I had to cut the metal piece that connects the outside handle to the inside (something I was not aware that I would have to do since I replaced the handle on my back door with a cheap handle from Lowe's and had no such problem), and I don't have an extensive collection of tools so I ended up wearing it down with a pair of pliers. It wasn't a big deal since I was able to do it though. However, to my dismay, I found that the inside latch wouldn't catch, so the latch was essentially there for decoration, as the slightest pressure would open the door. I am returning the item for this reason.I am still giving this latch four stars because it wasn't a design flaw, as others are able to use the latch; it is simply my own door that is not compatible, and I am sure that I would like this product if I was able to use it."
3,Latch works but difficult to lock,This latch was easy to install and it fit perfectly in the place of the previous handle. My only complaint is that you have to take a few minutes to get the lock to work. My wife has given up even trying to lock it. So overall I'd buy it again but just be forewarned that it takes a bit of practice and patience.
2,not quite the vulgar boatmen,Not the best renditions of Russian folk tunes. Sounds like they were sung by locals - not necessarily singers.
2,average sci-fi,This book is a bit tedious. The writer has some good premsises but somehow the writing doesn't captivate. There is much made about the lifes of the scientists so I was hoping it would become an elegant book: but it did'nt.
3,The Black Hole Talks,"The problem with letting scientists write science fiction is that they are scientists. You run the risk of ending up back in the middle of a college lecture when all you really wanted was a good read._Eater_ only occassionaly delves into hard science land while providing an amusing jaunt into the not-to-distant future where an intelligent black hole is approaching Earth with significantly gray motivations.Benford tames the science part of the science fiction while creating slightly two dimensional characters include the black hole. Yes, the black hole talks.What I particulary enjoyed about this read was Benford's gift for one liners & witty sayings ... ""to the man who owns a hammer, every problem looks like a nail"" He has a quick wit and so do his characters.In the end, the good guys do win in a less than believable fashion. But we're ok with that since this isn't science. It's science fiction."
3,A competent homage to Fred Hoyle's,"'The Black Cloud"", but I just didn't like the people in the story--not very nice."
2,Benford can do much better than this,"I've enjoyed a lot of Benford's stuff in the past (especially his ""Galactic Center"" series), but I couldn't get more than halfway into this one, about an intelligent mini-black hole entering the solar system and observing/threatening Earth. Some of the astronomy is interesting, but I'm not a scientist and Benford allows too many *very* specialized techy things to go by without elucidation. He somewhat reminds me here of an updated Fred Hoyle (not a compliment)."
1,"Is it about science, is it about government?","It seems that Gregory Benford can't make up his mind. Once the science part was just about over and the government part really started I gave up on Eater. If astronomers are really like what is described here I'm glad I went into geology. The characters seemed to take on what ever characteristic necessary for a particular scene. I never bacame familiar with the characters, it seemed that any one of them could be speaking any part of dialogue. After a while it seemed that Benford changed the plot just to keep ahead of the reader. I never knew what was going to happen, in a bad sense. I did find the scientific discovery part interesting so I'll give Cosm a try."
2,Not boring enough,"Had this book been slightly more boring, I wouldn't have read so much of it. I kept waiting for some improvement."
2,"too implausible, story ran out of steam halfway through","The novel had too many implausibles for me to suspend disbelief. Examples: Astronomers do not outwit spies. Humans do not outwit 7.5 million year old entities whose brains operate a million times faster. The rest of the world doesn't sit around and let the U.S. conduct negotiations with an alien that can destroy all of humanity. And there is no ""Hawaiian chic"".The story was essentially over by page 190 (of 371). What you learn from the subsequent pages has no effect on the story's denouement. Fat books sell better than skinny books, I guess. If you're like me, by page 250 you'll be hoping for some friendly rutting among the astronomers to relieve the monotony, but your hopes will be in vain.For good Benford, try Cosm or Timescape. For good Benford with rutting politicians thrown in as a bonus, try Shiva Descending."
2,"It's a modern re-write of Hoyle's ""The Black Cloud""","I realised after the first few chapters that many aspects of ""Eater"" are directly 'borrowed' from Fred Hoyle's classic ""The Black Cloud"" which was published in the 1950's. e.g. 1) Strange astronomical artifact discovered to be space beast; 2) British astronomer royal named 'Kingsley' leads team; 3) Subterfuge used to recruit members of scientific team; 4) Key character killed at end by action of space beast; 5) Unsuccessful missile attack on the space beast; 6) Others that would give the end away... The coincidences are so close that they cannot be accidental. ""Eater"" differs by making the creature hostile, but I preferred Hoyle's ending, even though (because?) it was philosophy rather than star-wars. One week after I read ""Eater"", Fred Hoyle died...Hmmmm..."
5,Lamp set,"What can I say about lamps, they do the trick light up the area I purschaed them for, and seem to be well made."
2,Hit and Miss,"This book was alright, but stories about guys screwing goats and some rich little brat from America that put people into unnecessary danger for her own adventure wasn't what I expected."
4,Received in good condition and the kids were thrilled with the set.,Kids were very happy I was able to get this set for them even though it has been discontinued.in stores
3,Perfect holiday story.....,"Protagonist Joy is at a crossroads in her life. She meets a widower and his young son, which sets her course in a completely new direction. Quite unexpected for Joy but turns out, just what she needs.The book was a pleasant escape, there's a twist so I don't want to give it away. That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5."
1,Are women doormats?,"I was very disappointed in this book. How could a woman take any blame and offer almost instant forgiveness in a situation like this? Joy had found her husband in bed with her sister. The sister is now pregnant with her ex-brother-in-law's child and is inviting Joy to their wedding. Joy ""runs away"" for a few weeks and comes back full of forgiveness, happily awaiting the birth of her niece and helping to plan her sister's wedding. Yuck! Through all of this absurdity the sister and ex-husband show no remorse. Adultery is a deal-breaker in a marriage. The husband and sister have lost the right to have any relationship with her. I won't even get into the absentee father and son that Joy meets during her ""magical"" experience. Joy was portrayed as a weak, needy individual. What sort of role model is that for women? Shame on you, Kristin Hannah."
1,Not Kristin's Best,"I am a huge Kristin Hannah fan and was excited to get this book. Boy was I ever let down. From the beginning and the unrealistic start, to the finish, which left me with asking the question ""did Kristin Hannah really write this book""?. It was a a total disappointment, one I am not used to having with Kristin Hannah books."
1,A Waste of Time,"I've never been prompted to write a review before, but I was so infuriated after finishing this book that I felt the need to vent.I'm angry that I wasted time and money on this piece of drivel. The plot lines have been detailed in other reviews, so all I will say is this: If you swallowed the ""Bobby in the shower"" explaination while watching Dallas years ago, you'll probably be able to tolerate this book. If not, skip it."
5,Best ever,Kristin Hannah has outdone herself again! I could not put this book down and finished it in less than 2 days. The characters are so real and as always feeling descriptions to make you cry. I predict it will be a Hallmark Hall Christmas movie in future years. The story is so real and absorbing that you hate for it to end. Can't wait for the next book by Kristin.
1,Ludicrous and Laughable,Comfort & Joy is such a silly story. If you enjoy watching soap operas and don't mind shallow characters and ridiculous storylines this book is for you.
4,Loved It!,"Wow, I'm really surprised to read the other reviewer's comments here. I didn't feel at all the same about this book. I loved it and thought it was a very warm, touching and unique book that had a strong message to tell. I found myself not able to put it down and finished it within several hours. I thought it was well-written, cleverly plotted and felt the story was more about Joy and the boy learning to heal than a romance between Joy and the father."
3,not her best,"Although it's quick and action packed in the beginning, the middle is harder to get through ...the story line is dragging..i enjoy all of Krisitn Hannah's books..this one is easier to put down...."
4,book review,This was a delightful story with a totally unexpected & not quite rational ending. Most members of our book club liked the story.
1,Did Not Like AT All!!!,"I was given this in audio and thought I would be listening to a warm sweet Christmas book. So not the case. Her sister cheats with her husband and by the end of the book, all is well between them. The sister and her husband are having a baby and getting married and she just seems to think it is all ok. I hope with all my heart that if that really happened the lying, cheating sister and husband would get what they deserve and it would not be a happy marriage and a baby! The magic seemed to be thrown in there to help ease her pain. It was such a waste of time and a great disappointment for a holiday book. Please don't waste your time."
3,BITTERSWEET ROMANCE NOVEL,"COMFORT & JOY is a lovely romance novel that is pure fantasy. A woman named Joy is horribly betrayed by her younger sister and husband. Joy runs away, boarding the first airplane flight she can get on. The airplane crashes. When Joy awakens she decides to flee the accident, disappearing so she can start a new life. On her journey she meets a young boy named Bobby and his gorgeous (of course) single father, Daniel. Comfort & Joy is pure fantasy and escapism. What woman at some point in her life hasn't fantasized about starting over and/or magically meeting the man of her dreams who will love and cherish her and only her? Books such as this can provide temporary relief from the disappointments of reality and can even be encouraging. Like most of Kristin Hannah's novels there is some heaviness and ugliness in the novel which keeps the book from being too light and fluffy. This was a short story and easy to read. I enjoyed it and recommend it."
4,"Don't Think, Just Read","I just finished reading this book, didnt take me that long. I found the story fasinating and really captured my attention and made me want to continue reading on. When I got to the second part where she finds out the truth, I went back to reread most of the conversation parts and its like all of a sudden I'm like Joy, putting the pieces together.I guess to read this book, its pretty much just an enjoyment. I mean for me, the ending was pretty much how I imagined it to be so if you do too much thinking into the logic and reality, it pretty much spoils it. So Im trying not to overthink the whole possibilities of what mightve happened there."
1,skip this one!,"I have been reading Hannah's work all summer. Out of 8 books, this is the ONLY disappointment.The first-person writing style only highlights the main character being self-absorbed and selfish. The story is not magic or fantasy - it's just silly and disturbing at the same time. If you are just discovering Hannah's work, read Winter Garden or Firefly Lane, or anything else but this one! She is a wonderful writer."
1,not good at all,susan from washington state. i have read several of kristin's books and loved every one. this one blew me away. did not like it at all. the whole plot was bad. this one will not keep me from kristin's books. there are just going to be stories we do not like. i do love the fact that she writes about cities and towns in my home state.
1,Comfort and Joy,Very disappointed with this novel by Kristen Hannah. Unlike others I have read and would not recommend the book to anyone. Lost my interest from the very beginning and never actually escalated as a good read.
3,quirky surprise ending,"This story seems a bit like a romance novel, but avoids the sappiness by an unusually surprising ending."
2,"Simple, basic, unchallenging -- if that's what you want...","I am all for suspending my disbelief, but this book felt like a marginal effort by a marginal author to reach a mass audience looking for a warm, fuzzy, quick read about Christmas and love. Prose was overly basic, characters were underdeveloped. Best thing I can say about this book is that it was short."
2,Unpredictable and odd,"Not only did this book confuse me but it made me feel uncomfortable. It started out normal and quickly crashed into a tail spin of a chaotic plot with no hope of a happy ending. This poor woman Joy Callandro...the things she goes through...You don't know whether to feel sorry for her or to just detach from the story. it's very odd ending left me feeling like i drank something that i read the name of and thought, wow this should be delicious and then once i drank it and finished it, i realized how gross it was. that's how it made me feel...so if you like that feeling...this is your book"
3,"Not my favorite, but I'll still be seeking comfort in Kristin Hannah's other books!","Hmmm. A little disappointed with this one! It wasn't a bad read, but it was to close to the movie 'Sixth Sense' and 'Just Like Heaven' for me. Anyway, if this is the first book of Hannah's your going to read, STOP! Don't start with this one. Read: 'The Things We Do For Love"" or. 'Night Road' and come back to this one later."
2,I'm confused,"This was the first and last Kristin Hannah book I will read. The story started out OK. I get the infidelity, I get the plane crash, I get Daniel and Bobby. What I don't get is Part 2. The author didn't explain at the end how Joy was there and wasn't there and Bobby knew who she was. I kept waiting for an explanation on that. It never came. The ending could have been so much better."
4,purchased for my Kindle,"Have not read this yet; still in my Kindle to read.Cannot comment on this book since I haven't read it yet, but do like Kristin Hannah reading."
5,Love...Love...LOVE!!!,My first Laura Mercier purchase. Read great reviews & they are so TRUE. I don't like wearing heavy foundation but wanted something to help with my dry skin areas on my face and give me just a little coverage. This is perfect!! It's pricey but the tube is big and you don't need much. So worth it!!
4,Sheer coverage with the added benefit of moisturizer and spf,"I have a minimal make up routine but this has been a must for 3 years now. Initially I hesitated at the price, but it's worth it. It offers a sheer coverage that evens out my completion in a way that looks natural. It can also be layered for extra coverage when there's a breakout.During summer months, I use this as my primary moisturizer and in winter I apply a lightweight, oil free moisturizer (Dermalogica Active Moist) several minutes before this because it doesn't seem to have enough effectiveness for my dryish, winter skin.If you like a minimal, clean and even look - this is worth the price."
2,Foundation is heavy,I wanted to find a high scale foundation I could use on my oily skin that had light coverage. This product didn't live up to my expectations. It went on very creamy and made my skin more oily than it orginally was. I have very oily skin in the summer and dry in the winter.
4,Solidly good product,"thus far seems to be a good product, just got it yesterday. good for light coverage.UPDATE...I have been now using this product for a few years. I love it.I don't use foundation on a daily basis; this is perfect when I need it. Light, not greasy, just enough coverage to smooth out some of the flaws that come with living 40 years.This is a beauty staple for me."
5,Glowing complexion,"I don't like foundation, and my skin is prone to break out. I have uneven skin tone, and find that the Fresh face luster works quite well, but I've been looking for something with a little more coverage. This product works wonder on my face. It evens out my skin tone instantly and goes on smoothly. I have combination skin, so I use the oil free version, but I do recommend putting on your regular moisturizer prior to this product if you have dry cheeks like me. But the result is amazing, my skin looks glowing and natural all day. I always get compliments for my complexion these days."
3,Good product with several drawbacks.,"I'm mystified that they call this tinted moisturizer because I've used regular foundations that were more sheer than this stuff. Having said that this is a fairly nice product with a few drawbacks. One, it's very expensive. Two, it's not very blendable. I have to put regular moisturizer underneath this stuff to get it to go on evenly and smoothly. It is also feels somewhat greasy (like suntan lotion). I set it with Laura Mercier loose powder and it looks fine .... but is it worth $42 a tube? That's debatable. I think I'll try other tinted moisturizers before buying this one again."
3,Good tinted moisturizer.,"After reading all the raves about Laura Mercier TM, I decided to finally try it. First off I recieved the package pretty quick and intact. My purchase came with a bunch of free samples which I thought was pretty neat. Now for the tinted moisturizer.. I haven't tried too many TMs so I can't really compare.. but this moisturizer is alright. I purchased it in Nude and it turned out to be too dark on me. That or the color oxidized? later in the day. You might need to purchase two different colors to get the right shade (which is pretty expensive). It does delivery buildable coverage like a foundation almost. I think the Oil-free one (the one I have) is not as thick as the regular one however so the coverage is more sheer. To get to the point, I think this is a good, high end tinted moisturizer and I probably would like it a lot more if it was my shade."
3,Not Too Shabby,"So, I bought this moisturizer based on great reviews Ive read, and also on a recommendation from a friend. I bought it in the Oil Free Nude color, and really like what it has to offer for my face. Its wonderful at smoothing all uneven tones of skin (I have dark circles and red areas near my nose and chin), and its light and easy to apply. The coverage is pretty perfect-- it's not too foundation-y (I hate cakey foundation on me) but not too transparent to where you cant see it an hour later. Really, it's a fantastic tinted moisturizer (not that Ive tried many though). However, I think it made me break out, which is why Im giving it 3 stars! I do have slightly sensitive skin, so chances are its my skin and not the product, but Im a little bummed to have spend $42 on something I cant wear as much as I thought I could. I wore it for 3 days in a row and suddenly, BAM, no can do. If your skin is fickle like mine, maybe try it first before you buy."
3,Covers pretty well,"If you are in a hurry - this is a pretty good product. It's a wee bit ""tacky"" when applying (it definitely doesn't go on as easy as an actual moisturizer). Also - it has that ""sunblock smell"" to it - which kind of annoys me - but may not bother the ""normal"" person - ha ha."
3,Good product,It is okay; maybe I ordered the wrong shade. I use it anyway. Will order again in a different shade. Worked very will with my dark skin.
5,AMAZING,"I am by no means a makeup girl. But as I get older, I don't treat myself as well. I saw an ad for this in a magazine, went to their website, looked the product info over & sought out their suggestions for a color, & purchased it on Amazon. My seller shipped fast, & it came in a nice tight package with reuseable funky cardboard zigzags..First morning I used it, I looked like I had just gotten back from an amazing vacation! I only use it in the mornings & during the week before applying any other makeup. I wanna tell everyone about this moisturizer."
1,mucky stuff,"Not sure why the high praise for this product. After reading all the glorious reviews I purchased it, opened it, put it out and gagged. Smelled rotten and looked like 3 dollar coverup from the drug store. Needless to say it instantly met the trash can head on. I recommend trying it in a shop, do not buy online - you can't return it and it's a lot to pay for a major miss."
2,Guild BORES,"Its a neat concept but the execution is boring. You only meet people in towns, the rest of the time youre on your own (or with a partner or two). You have to stroll through towns which are enhanced chat rooms where noobs cry for help and embark on boring missions. Get World of Warcraft instead. Its worth the money cuz its actually fun to play and where you can actually interact with more people."
4,Very Happy,"All components of this collector's edition meet or exceed my expectations! A bit pricey but considering all you get, it's worth it."
5,Good Game,"I use to play Ever Quest, Dark Age of Camelot and others for hours as often as I could then one day, I got married and had kids. Now, I have almost no time to do anything. Heck, I am lucky to go mow my yard and I hate yard work. I still love MMORPG games so, when I heard about ""no subscription fees"" I bought it.Since I do not have the time to socialize like you have to in other MMORPG games, I think it's nice to have the option to hire henchmen that actually play better than most players. The storyline missions are a must and actually is the best way to see what Guild Wars has to offer for the solo player.Guild Wars also has player vs. player opportunities, you can join a guild which is extremely helpful in the growth of your character assuming you join the right one.Guild Wars will sell you additional ""chapters"" as with any other MMORPG; however, the patches, general updates, and some music downloads and additional game content are FREE."
3,"Light, but not very efficient and not the best for reference","If you only need a small dictionary, I suppose this one will do. But don't expect anything else. The book's big grammar section is not useful at all. You have to be extemely patient to read through it. In addition to the small print, this section is confusing and badly organized. This book is definitely NOT handy for a quick grammar reference.I would prefer that instead of cramming everything together publishers gave more space to the dictionary part, including more words and using a bigger print, and then may be inserted some reference table (verbs, etc.) for people who have studied Spanish grammar before.I think you should look around for similar items before settling on this one."
5,"If you love Shiver, you'll want Play/Record too","I've always thought Shiver was quite the masterpiece, very complex with incredible layering... almost like a soundtrack without a movie, ranging from downright beautiful to entertainingly amusing. So as much as I loved Shiver I don't know how I went so long without knowing Play/Record even existed. But as soon as I discovered it I couldn't place the order fast enough and am quite glad I did.And although in my opinion all the tracks on Play/Record don't quite hit the highs found from beginning to end on Shiver, I still heartily recommend it if you love Shiver. Add It Up and Whistle Wind in particular are fantastic."
3,A true GD album,This is an excellent record by the Dead. It catches them in a good period musically. 1980 was the year that new keyboardist Brent Mydland was beggining to show maturity in the band after his insertion in 79.The songs here are very good and to me are up in the level of bears choice which to me is one of the all time great GD albums.
3,Overrated acoustic Dead,"This CD is OK. The acoustic sets the Dead were playing in the 80s were abosolutely awesome, and because this is the only live album I know of that has been released from this period, it is deffinetly an important album. However, I would reccomend that anyone who trades Dead shows and already has many of these songs on other acoustic shows skips this album. The versions of many of the songs offered here are pittiful compared to other versions. However, for those of you who are not into tape trading, I do highliy reccomend this album as a sampling of a very cool period in Dead history. If you want some really incredible versions of these songs though, I would reccomened hunting down a copy of the Dead's acoustic set on 12/6/80, which I have and treasure."
2,"This is not ""it""!","Grateful Dead Unplugged - what a great idea! I thought! But oops, that's not what I expected at all! Their playing on Reckoning is uninspired, yes one could say boring! Two stars for they're the Dead, only. If you want to have the essential Dead stuff, buy ""Workingman's Dead"", ""American Beauty"", ""Dead Set"" (which includes the far better unplugged material than Reckoning) and, as far as I've heard, Europe '72. Avoid Reckoning...."
2,Save your money,"This not such a great GD album. The sound quality is bad, the packaging is lame and worse of all the song set is trash! I orignally got this album for Bird Song and Cassidy. Both versions here are ok, but nothing too special.Don't waste time on this one...go get Without a Net for GD...that is one hell of a live one!"
4,"The Dead ""Unplugged"" and ""TraditionaL""","The ""Reckoning"" album is somewhat of an oddity in the Dead's catalgue. It's comprised of many ""traditional"" tunes (such as ""Been Around This World"" and ""On The Road Again""), and it's the Dead completely ""unplugged"", with Garcia and Weir only on accoustic guitars.The album creates it's own atmosphere, it's almost like you can feel them sitting in your room causally playing. Pulled from several shows in 1980, it shows a very different side from what most Deadheads expect, but you can just feel the *love* the band has for traditional and unplugged music. Garcia's guitar work is outstanding. In all, quite different from the electric ""jams"" we all know and love on Dead live albums, but a very nice addition to the catalogue."
2,Something 'off' with this product...,"I actually love this product - I've been using this cleanser since L'Oreal put it on the market. However, for a few years now, it's been getting harder to find, even online. So, when I found that it was still available here, I bought more... of course, knowing that it would probably be the last few I would buy. However, the I received looked yellow, not white, and had an odd smell to it. It also didn't lather the way it should or take off my make-up as well as it used to. Needless to say, I had been sampling other products knowing I'd have to find something else... and decided it was finally time to let this product go."
1,Apology,"This book is a waste of the readers time and money. Christensen travels to the Costa Rican rain forest with his family to settle the ""frontier"". He never gives an explinatoin as to why he decided to travel to the ""frontier"", only excuses and apologies to his many, many mistakes. Darryl Cole-Christensen hates the rainforest, he hated it from the day he arrived and he hates it to this day. His only interest in the rainforest is monetary, money drives this man and this book. I had to buy and read this book for my college course, you have a choice."
4,Quick sequel!,Fun little stories to read! Anna is starting her own journey now. Will be fun to follow her in the next book!
2,"Wow, Be Ready to be Disappointed","I ordered this to use at my parents house for the holidays. Just opened it and there's about 10 different sections to 'pump' air into. I got to the point of blowing it up like a raft.Anyway, there was a slow leak in the seam of the 'dashboard.' Read the directions and it says to use the patches except on seams. Great. What are we to do then?I called the company and they said to return it because there's nothing they could do, they are out of stock or discontinued. I tried the patch. Nope, it didn't work. Disappointed daughter, frustrated (and now out of breath) parents as well, with no place for my daughter to sleep now for the holidays except to get something spur of the moment."
3,"Looks good, but the smell is too bad","Once pumping air into the different pieces, it looks pretty good. My [...] years-old daughter loves it. But the biggest problem is the plastic smell, it won't go away! We also bought the pooh bed, the smell is gone after few days, but not this one!!We have another one still wrapped in box, don't want to give it to friends' kids because of the smell.Anyone knows how to fix it?"
3,Low quality Air Pump,The bed was of OK quality. But it takes very long to pump in air to this. Also the air pump which came with this is of very low quality. It broke the first time i used it. I had to fill air with other source. My kids use this bed for playing and its fun for them. Also the air doesn't stay for long. It needs to be refilled after a week or so.
3,Fun but only lasted two weeks,"This was fun - lots of detail and my 4 year old loved it. We used it while visiting her Aunt in California.We were there for 3 weeks, by the second week, it developed a slow leak on one side. We ended up just throwing it away after the visit."
3,extra toddler bed,we bought this as a temporary bed for travel for our toddler it was ok. it is very large and takes up about as much room as a queen size bed and the actual bed part is appropriate for a small child or toddler we could not get sheets to fit this so we just laid a blanket in it. it had a small leak around the seams but overall it was worth the purchase for what we needed it for. she had fun using her imagination playing in it after we were done using it. this is an ok product
2,"Keeler, trying hard","Greg Keeler wants to have his poems mean something; at every turn, he's trying to define the indefinable, which is the job of every poet worth his salt. Unfortunately, too often these poems simply work by the numbers instead of shocking and surprising us with the sense of bewildering discovery that this poem holds the truth. At times, the poems are simply derivative; his poem on ""The Guilt Bug"" is a spiritual rip-off of Philip Larkin's paean to the inherited complexes one gets from parents, ""This Be the Verse."" His memo poems are very like the poems William Carlos Williams wrote on his little prescription pads. He works in the confessional mode, but has none of the nuttiness that the confessional mode requires to be truly shocking. Overall, there are moments when I enjoyed his folksy twists away from the poetic, but nothing stuck in my head as truly marvelous."
4,Made me want to try again!,"This is a must read for couples who are experiencing daily frustration, ongoing bitterness, unforgiveness, distrustfulness, anger, or even hatred toward one another. I've read a lot of books on forgiveness in relationships, but this one had some unique concepts and practical principles that I had not come across. The content is helpful for the couple experiencing only small irritations or for the couple who has experienced a major crisis in their relationship. It's filled with real life stories, but not slurpy, or fairy taleish. I read it in one night! I only wish I wasn't divorced, so I could try to love, honor and forgive again in my marriage! This book will give you a Christlike approach to redeeming your relationships!"
2,Lacked Chapin's trademark enthusiasm,"This CD was a big disappointment. Chapin's other works have successfully mixed slow and upbeat tunes, but this one is a big-time downer. We listened to it while going on a family vacation in the car, and only about two songs made any of us in the car even notice the music! It really lacked her trademark enthusiasm. The production side, always a strong suit, was definitely the biggest plus. Don't recommend it."
2,WHAT'S THIS AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?,"Mary Chapin Carpenter meets the Mamas & Papas,Beach Boys and Beatles complete with lashings of strings and a general overproduction-what a disappointment this is after such a long wait.Chapes has strived to make this outing sound different, when all I wanted was more of the same great lyrics and crisp simple production as on her past work. I'll pass on this thanks and hope she returns to more familiar shores next time."
3,Very Different From the Others,"Mary-Chapin Carpenter's Time*Sex*Love is an album set aside from her others. It is not country, not folk, not really even in between the two. It is more of a mellow, easy-listening lesson of life. I personally did not enjoy the album as I have her others, however I will not condemn it or rip it apart. As a long time MCC fan, I think she is growing in a different direction than what her other albums may have taken her in the start. Time*Sex*Love reminds me of something I would put in the CD-Player on a rainy day. I enjoy the album, but not to the potential I was hoping. I would not recommend it for anyone who is looking for the MCC of ""Come On Come On"" or even ""A Place in the World"". I didn't find many of the tunes capture the sing-along-quality I have come to associate this artist with. Rather, the pop-like, easy-listening quality some of them have only cater to a few of my music-listening moods."
4,Gets Better with Each Spin,"This is easily MCC's best since ""Stones in the Road."" While it may be true that several of the songs are introspective, her mixed feelings about time, sex, and love are beautifully expressed. This very personal CD contains a blend of styles. The standout track is ""The Dreaming Road,"" a wonderful ballad that tells a story in only the way Mary Chapin-Carpenter can. Much better than her last studio effort, ""A Place in the World."""
4,Music for the Soul,"For those of us who have listened to Mary Chapin Carpenter for more than 10 years, this CD will no doubt be listed as one of our favorites. It is the freshest sounding CD she has cut in a while. MCC is one of the best writers of ""lonely"" and this one doesn't dissapoint. Even though this set of music contains the trademark of her music with the heartfelt words and emotional melodies she uses some new instruments and departs into some fun giggles, which will set you off into your own giggle fest. I have recommened this CD to more than one of my friends and I highly recommend it to anyone else who might be a fan or would like to just listen to some music to fill your soul."
4,Beautifully textured adult pop,"Mary Chapin Carpenter's latest effort may not burn up the country charts, but it should find a niche among fans who appreciate thoughtful, insightful lyrics and richly layered musical arrangements. While the country-folk vibe of previous work is still evident, Carpenter injects her sound with some lovely ""pop-isms""-- Beatlesque harmonies, strings, flutes, etc. If you're a fan of literate adult popsters (Aimee Mann, Shawn Colvin, Jon Brion) time*sex*love* is a worthy addition to your collection. (And be sure to check out the hidden track at the end of the disc!)"
5,Best Mary Chapin CD Yet!,"This is a great CD. I have been a fan of Mary Chapin for years, but this CD tops everything she has done to date. My husbund says it is ""girl music"" and maybe he is right. All I know is that I really love it."
2,self-pleasing self-pity,"the cover tells a story, the title another one. What has happened to MCC ? I really adored her in her days up to Live at Wolf Trap. Another gracious voice has sailed into self-pleasing mannerism (see Mary Black). Sorry to say that. Where are those life-enhancing songs like The Hard Way, This Shirt or Almost Home? Were it not for the lyrics... , I address myself to June Tabor, Eddi Reader or Cheryl Wheeler."
2,I really like her. I really do. But...,"This album is so overproduced that the best thing on it is the hidden track at the end. It's the only cut where the musicians seem to be enjoying themselves.There are a few standard MCC type ditties on this. But even they are overcome by strings, horns and other impediments to the clean, clear music that has made her so successful _ it sounds like Phil Spector and his Wall of Sound (from back in the '60s) has resurrected itself. Most of the album was recorded in London, which is dangerous _ Brits tend to overproduce. Even Sir George Martin got in the act, but what he did for the Beatles 35 years ago doesn't work here.One other thing: the mix is so bad on the third cut, ""Swept Away,'' that you can't even hear her voice. According to the credits, that was mixed in Virginia and Maine, not London. Go know."
2,Well below her capacity,"Not an awful album if you know and love MCC. But even the most defensive reviewer here can't argue this ranks with her best work. As a whole it's self-indulgent, with unfunny in-jokes (the 'mind the gap' tripe at the end) and too much repetition. There is good stuff here but if you're looking for an entree into the MCC catalog, go back to _Come On, Come On_ or _Stones in the Road_."
2,"Long time fan says: ""Pass""","There is a hidden track at the end of this CD that is just marvelous---the musicians jam with such spirit and a true love of music. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD suffers from overproduction and belabored writing. The songs are mostly forgettable--- I have a difficult time remembering even the titles to the songs once they're over. Much slower tempos than in her earlier work, too. I love her earlier work and would recommend ""Come On, Come On"" and ""Stones in the Road"" to anyone just starting to appreciate the work of Mary Chapin Carpenter."
2,Style lacking substance,"After reading some reviews, I checked this one out of the library for a listen. I own almost ALMOST ALL of her other albums, still listen to ""Come On, Come On"" and ""Shooting Straight"" regularly, and have seen her 5 times in concert. I do LOVE her earlier work, but this one falls short. I am not interested in such heavily produced songs, where it seems as if extra instruments are tacked on in production. It is an introspective album, with lots of soul searching. I might buy this album---used, and at a discount."
1,Puts me to sleep,"Just what we don't need today is more navel gazing. We need ENTERTAINMENT. We used to get it with ""shut up and kiss me"" and even ""passionate kisses"" but there are no ""hits"" evident here. BTW I saw the last concert of the tour here in Columbia just a couple of weeks ago, and it was also very low energy."
1,Don't listen to the PR fluff reviews!,"The record comapny has written some nice 5 star fluff on this site. I'm a real MCC fan, and feel that she has hit bottom after peaking with perfection on Come On Come On, which has so many classics on it. Of course she couldn't top COCO, but SITR started her downward spiral. I didn't think she could get much worse than Place in the World, but this disc has no memorable songs, nothing that begs me to learn the words. I agree with whoever said it sounds like Beach Boys, Mamas/Papas and MCC put into a blender...a bloody mess!"
2,Judy Collins with a guitar,"If you are looking for a CD that you can sing along to, you'l take a pass on this CD. Sounds more like California coffee house ballads than Nashvile."
1,Not What she Used to Be,"I have utmost respect for MCC, but this album isn't the cause. Highly cerebral and no catchy melodies or lyrics. Love, life, and relationship introspection is great, but Come On, Come On, Mary, give us something we can sing to! Definitely a great disappointment."
4,Nice!,"This isn't one of MCC's BEST works, but it is still very very good. She is a master story-teller and song-crafter. Every album she has ever done shines, and this is no exception."
4,Time Sex Love - back to the basics,"For those of you who really like Mary-Chapin Carpenter, this will be awesome! It's getting back to her older style, reminiscent of Come on Come On and Shooting Straight in the Dark CD's. She's got quite a few mello songs, with some upbeat ones. If you like her songwriting, this CD is packed with great lyrics.It's probably not going to make any chart toppers, since it's not exactly country music, but I'm sure you'll like it if you are a M-C fan."
2,A real disappointment,"I love Mary Chapin Carpenter -- especially the melodic tracks that she gathered together for her last album, ""Party Doll."" Unfortunately, TIME SEX LOVE veers in the opposite direction. Her soulful vocalizing is missing and the lyrics are stilted rather than bittersweet and thoughtful. The up-tempo tunes have none of the raw beauty of ""Down at the twist and shout."" Replay her old CDs, but save your money here. I hope she finds her way back home on the next go around."
2,Very poorly organized.,"Don't let Bartlett's reputation fool you. As other reviewers have noted, it's arranged by author. To find quotations on a particular subject -- love, wisdom, war, politics, etc. -- you have to consult the index and laboriously look up each reference, which is a royal pain. Hoyt's New Cyclopedia of Practical Quotations, among other books, is much more useful, and a much better buy."
5,The definitive Quotations Book,"Well over 100 years old, Bartlett's is the definitive Quotations reference. That said, don't expect to find everything there - it's just not possible to include everything. I have over 20 quotation books and still can't find some things.An excellent reference book. Don't try to read it cover to cover unless you're an insane quotation freak (like myself)."
4,important book,"This book covers information you can find yourself through a good research on the Net, but for what it cost I would get the book and save myself hours of research.For the lazy type of person this book is a must ;-)"
5,super cute!,We bought these for a doll house my uncle built my 3 year old. The furniture is very well made and I think it will hold up to her use. Did I mention it is also super cute!!!
3,Just a comment,"I thought this review section was a place where people could review a game that they have played, not critique the grammer of other reviewers or insult their place of origin.It might be a ""New Jersey thing"", but then again I would NOT even remotely go bragging about being from New Jersey if I was so unfortunate as to have to reside there.Just a thought."
1,it sound good,i dont no one thing about this game but it sound good and the name make me one to may be by it i dont play xo much but i no game i hvae a xob a game culb and a ps2 and if i puy this game i think you need to to hop you like what i have told you by by the way i have been playing game for 22 years now
4,Buy It,"This one is great! 4 out of 5 stars. Camera, gameplay and graphics are really good. They seemed to have mastered camera control and the gameplay is a modified shoot-em up. The graphics are clean, crisp and very detailed (windows are quite amazing).The only cons are that they need more music in the game and while the ghosts are neat looking they dont seem to have that Marc Davis drawing style applied.Buy this if you are a HM fan. Buy this if you are a fan of haunted house games that have a GhostBusterish way of snagging the ghosts. The Haunted Mansion is a visual Treat."
2,Too Difficult for kids,"Bought this game for my son's Birthday and he was bored. Very Difficult and we had to go online to see how to find clues to play. Only works on the old xbox not xbox 360. I am sure it is fun for teens, but my son lost interest within 30 min."
1,too wordy,Too much extraneous information. Too wordy and doesnt get to the point.Chapters are way to long for what it is trying to convey.
2,nursing issues,"This book is easy to read, but quite honestly I purchased this because it was required of my school. I have not found it to be that useful, or interesting to make time to read the chapters through. A bit on the boring side."
5,Just what I needed,I make art quilts & this blade works nicely for creating wavy edges on my fabric strips. Love the look it gives to flower stems.
3,Not as great as the stars involved,"I bought this as soon as I saw it, thinking what a find to have something from Sinatra in 1957 to watch, but having seen it I must agree with those who consider it a disappointment overall. The most important thing is that while the box says the program is 90 minutes long, it's actually only 30. The remaining 60 is the extras, which are interesting enough, but still that's highly misleading.The show itself is all right, I'd pictured more guest stars and interaction between Frank and Bing, but it was fine. The singing is great, of course, the color and production values are perfectly fine with me...the only real quibble I have is the mis-stated length, which is a big one, I hate being deceived.So if you don't mind the short program time and the fact that the entire show is basically Bing and Frank singing Christmas standards, then this is for you. Personally I could have skipped it and grabbed a real Sinatra or Crosby CD instead."
2,Misleading on run time.,"The 25 minutes of Bing and Frank is good, not their best but good. The disk case states 90 minute running time and the Amazon site gives running time as 60 minutes. If you enjoy the majority of the disk being ""bonus"" materail it's fine. I feel it's a rip off."
3,happy holidays with bing and frank,"the film type was older and not as enjoyable. it was just the 2 of them enjoying an evening, it was a very short dvd,Shipped as promised."
5,A CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sinatra & Crosby at Christmas time joking, singing. If you are a real hepcat, swinger, or truly cool person you must own this DVD!!! ESSENTIAL dvd for any hipsters collection!"
5,Perfection for the holidays!,I was happy when I got to see this lost holiday treat. It is equal to a glass of cold milk and a hot chocolate chip cookie. Bing and Bob made this holiday special in this 50's color television special that reeks of the 50's and classic songs. Depressed this holiday season hopefully this will bring you out of some of it if not all. If your local library doesn't carry it this is the place to get it.
4,"Wonderful, Vintage Christmas Memories","What a find! It's sad to think that this special was almost lost, but now it's here in COLOR. For those of you who grew up in the 1950's, it's a wonderful trip down memory lane to a simpler time. I do agree that Frank seems a little more tired than Bing, but both light up the screen with there take on some traditional Christmas carols. I give this 4 stars because, as it is so blatantly mentioned in the extras, the restoration job done on this film is horrible! But, I am at least thankful it exists and that we have the chance to enjoy it, even if it is not sparkling clear.*Note* Careful observers will notice that a new copyright date has been digitally edited into the closing credits ""MMI"""
4,Very Good and Well Worth The Cost,"This is the 1957 Christmas Special of the Frank Sinatra Show ... It has been colorized, and I am ""not"" a fan of colorizing b/w films, but ... I have to admit they did a good job of the colorization ... My only negative comment: they removed the commercials ... I like commercials in vintage TV shows ... At the very beginning they had posted the sponsors of the show and I was hopeful, but they were edited out ... Nice clean job of editing though ... Lots of music, lots of Christmas Carols ... All in all ""Very Entertaining"" ... I give it a firm good recommendation ..."
2,"Ok for background music, but boring to watch","I bought this for my parents, who were big fans of Frank and Bing back in the day, and are always looking for new videos to warch. Unfortunately, this is very very boring to watch. Because of that we weren't bothered too much by the fact it was short. The music is great to listen to however, so it makes good background holiday music--just don't expect it to be great viewing."
2,Ok,Used this book for graduate school and I did not like thebbook. Easy read but the information sucked!
1,The Book's Language Synthesizes Death,"I will give you an example:Found in Chapter 5, in a subsection about writing multiple choice questions (titled ""General Guidelines for Item Writing""):""5. Write the test item so that irrelevant factors do not prevent an informed student from responding correctly.""This abomination of a sentence translates to, ""Write clear questions.""That's 17 words to 3, over an 80% reduction. This summarizes my feelings about the whole book--that it could be reduced by 80% without loss of meaning.If that's your cup of tea, try it. Of course, common sense obviates most of its contents anyway."
1,don't bother,"You can only access briefs five times, and then you're shut out. Also, you must choose which casebook's material to install - you don't have access to all the material. Buy a print version instead - you'll have unlimited access and you can resell it."
1,"Tri-O-Plex High Protein Food Bar, Smores",I buy a lot of Chef Jay's products and must admit that this is the worse one I have ever had. Bad thing is I bought two boxes of them and will probably throw them all out. I couldn't even eat one.
2,Really didn't taste good.,"I bought 5 different protein bars from Amazon at one time to test them. This was the worst tasting. I bought it for my husband and he calls this the ""OSB"" one. I think it had good stuff in it and definitely had a lot of protein, but we didn't care for the taste."
3,Great Bar,"This product deserves 5 stars and I highly reccomend these bars. They normaly taste very good, but not from this seller. I suggest ordering from somewhere else. I ordered twice from this seller and both times the bars were rock hard. Normally these bars are very moist and easy to eat.Edit to my previous review. I decided to give this seller another chance and I'm glad I did. They have been nice and moist the last few batches I've gotten. Five stars"
5,matt darey,"if you are into trance you must get this CD!! all the hottest club hits in 2000 and 99 are on it. Matt Dareys amazing hits ""From Russia with Love, Bailamos, and Liberation"" are futured on this CD. If you like Matt you are going to love this CD..definately one of his best ones!"
5,"Hey, buy it already, OK?","40+ reviews, 5 star average rating. 'Nuff said. Matt Darey does an expectional mixing job on these 2 discs. Worth the higher price."
5,Solid music beautifully mixed.,"Matt Darey shows his impressive mixing skills on this collection. A fluid progression of tracks keeps the mood going. Respect to the couple of house tracks thrown in at the end of CD2.. Guess Matt wanted a change of pace at the end. Like the insert says, it's like arriving at Space on The Island. Viva Ibiza!"
5,Worth every penny,I was a bit reluctant to purchase this set because of the relatively high price compared to other double disc sets (such as those in the Global Underground series). After reading the reviews I decided to go for it and found it is worth the money. These two CDs offer an incredible mix of very upbeat trance. The first CD starts off with a very good remix of Solar Stone and just continues from there through very nice transitions. A highly recommended addition to your collection.
3,Kewl,"This Cd is futuristic and is ahead of its time. The songs are strange and mysterious, but are still fun to listen to. Sounds of the Satellites beams you up to the moon!"
5,ATMOSPHERIC BLACK METAL,"ABIGOR, definitely one of the most relevant black metal acts of the 90's worldwide. Principally for not coming from Norway or Sweden...BUY THIS, YOU BLACK METAL HEAD!!!This is not as Burzum-eske as their debut, but it is very essential also... A touch of female vocals and keyboards, medieval spirit music, great riffs and melodies... Best tracks are ""Scars in the Landscape of God"" and ""Dornen"".WARNING: don't worry, you may have to hear this album for 3 or 4 times until your ears get usual to it... It's normal... YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME, IT'S A GREAT ALBUM!!!"
3,PETA should visit the Pacific Islands.,"I can't help it when I watch these videos and get upset about what other cultures do to the animals in ceremonies. I just wish that this series didn't have to show in such (for me) graphic detail how cattle and dogs are killed during a wedding sequence. Aside from it really bothering me because I am a wimp, I wish Ian could have simply described briefly and in general what goes on and what to expect if one is, by some fluke, invited to a wedding on the Pacific Islands. The image has stuck with me for days and I just can't shake it off. The other side of me feels that this is possibly propeganda about how uncivilized certain cultures are and don't they need missionaries to help them see the light. Though it was very satisfying to hear about how the inhabitants of these islands would eat the missionaries, it still seemed somewhat judgemental. But then I may be being entirely too politically correct."
5,Something Good to read as an American who realy Loves Americ,"I read the book and most of the facts I found interesting to read. Some of the facts in this book , I already read through other news media ( Internet). I wish many Americans will read this book and learn about what is happening in the rest of the world due to American foreign policies.( Adding 25th eb 2004) Now the Iraq war is over..what this book discussed and said about BUSH policies(foriegn) has already come true. I read the book again recently for the second time after the Iraq war."
1,Where's the steel?!,"I ordered it from Amazon.comWhat I got was something cheap.The case, book were all there, but the Steelbooks were nowhere to be found.They were cheap standard plastic cases.yes it was new.had to send it back. and pay shippingBOOO!!!If you're gonna order it, make sure its steelbook."
5,awesome drive,"I have been using my 80Gb ximeta ndas for a while now and just now I am robocopying 40Gb of mp3 files to it on a copper connected pc and on a 802.11B connection am listening to mp3 files that reside on the ximeta device. No buffering issues whatsoever. I am also browsing the internet at the same time over the same 10Mb wireless link.This will work great with my netgear mp101 mp3 streamer.when the price is right, I will buy another unit."
1,This suit is horrible,"This is is not the one i order.You sent me a subsitute without my permissin.I wanted one like the fitst one i ordered.This suit sucks,it pinches,and sticks to your skin badly.Feels like you ripping your flesh off.The only way you can wear this suit is to put something under it.Then it double dont work.people dont buy this suit.Its not worth a penny. Rated 0"
4,thermal sweat suit,"this is a great sweat suit,once you put it on you start to sweat. the only thing i don't like about it is its very thin so sooner or later it will rip. so you have to be very carefull with this item but on the positive side it is a very good sweat suit and for the price you can not complain."
2,Does it's job but not durable,"Dont wash this, It makes you sweat but the material is too thin. I'm going to replace it soon."
5,Exciting Mystery,"Unlikely Adversaries is a mystery filled with suspense. It's an easy book to read.The characters in the book are well defined. Mr. Bloom evidences a clear understanding of the motivations of the lawyers he is describing and the environment they are working in.Take it to the beach, read it on the train, this book is very entertaining."
2,Don't bother seeing this one.,The film was boring and ridiculous. The DVD cover is the only thing interesting about this film. You could easily tell that all of the documentary footage are a re-enactment and hardly authentic. The re-enactments are so fake that I felt stupid for paying $24.99 for this DVD. Do not let the DVD cover intrigue you into wanting to see this boring disappointment. What a waste of my money.
3,I had credibility problems with this book also,"Especially with her contention that Jimi committed suicide. Jimi's closest companions during the European tour - Mitch, Billy Cox, roadie Eric Barrett, etc contend that Jimi was in great spirits weeks before his death, especially with regards to Electric Lady Studios. Sure, he had all the hangers-on, financial, and manager crap, but he just didn't sound suicidal.I liked hearing the more personal things, such as who Jimi's favorite actors were (Brando, James Dean), [...]"
4,"Interesting, Informative, Insightful","Wow, what can I say, the first 2/3 of the book were amazing. It was amazing to see Jimi from the perspective of someone so close to him. But I can honestly say that after the point at which Jimi Hendrix died, it seemed to me to be pages upon pages of law-related platitude and obituary-like talk. Other than that though, it was a very well written book that would sit well with any Hendrix fan."
1,"Jimi Hendrix: The Man, the Magic, the Truth","Ironically the word ""truth"" is used in the title. Having been a fan for decades and have read quite a bit of Jimi Hendrix non-fiction I found this book ridiculous. I have also been in the music business for 30 years. It sounds like the author bumped into Hendrix at a party and maybe thinks she knows enough about his inside life that she could wait until every contester is gone before deciding to write this malarkey. I could have written a better story from my research on Jimi Hendrix saying I hung out with him, her's is just inane. She takes a simple sentence and drags it out to a paragraph with flowery adjectives and adverbs probably to produce more pages as if to make this book appear to have more content. Save your time and money and read ""Room Full Of Mirrors"" by Charles R. Cross, informative and a more historical account that is well written."
4,Another Jimi Book,"Well I know she doesn't like Janie and a few things she said about Jimi's dad I personally didn't care for, but it's an interesting read."
5,a different angle on one of my favourite subjects Jimi Hendrix,"Sure you can read reviews about the technical facts on Jimi'slife and raise your pointy finger and suggest Sharon hassome things wrong, but really, this book isnt labelledas the be all and end all of Hendrix literature...I skimmed the 'early life' sections and went straight to the juicy bitswhen Sharon first met Jimi and from there it had me hook line and sinker.This book offers a unique look at the man, the legend of Jimi Hendrixand takes you back into urban London and New York in the late 1960'sand see how this whirlwind 4 year period evolved.Well done to Sharon for putting together such a nice bookand long live the wonderful legacy of Jimi Hendrix."
1,Battery doesn't work and can't get refund.,"Got an error message when I tried to use the battery: ""USE GENUINE BATTERY. -POWER OFF-"". I sent it back to AccessoryOne for a refund. I followed up after about 4 weeks; they said they never received it."
1,"Good idea, bad production.",These are awful. They leave white paint all over the drumheads and the cymbals. Get the other Zildjian stick/mallet combos and save your kit!
4,Quite good,"The book is very clear and helpful with details and pictures.If you wnat to understand more on Load Balancing I think the book is the right pick (at least intermediate users).Maybe more examples of different brands of load balancers (Cisco, F5 etc.) would have been appreciated.Overall I liked it very much."
3,Behold the power of the mind&#65533; only at the Twilight Zone.,"This is one of the few DVD's in the collection that you could actually consider conceptual: somehow all episodes deal with the powers of the mind. Who wants to know the future? William Shatner's character does, but does he realizes the price? Find out in ""Nick of Time"" (Season 2). ""The Prime Mover"" (Season 2), is about telekinesis at the service of a gambler... and that equals risky business. ""It's a Good Life"" (Season 3), stars a very young Billy Mummy with incredible and dangerous powers. Finally ""The Mind and the Matter"" (Season 2) shows a guy how the power of thought can create his perfect world."
5,Great Band and Great Material But MP3 Names All Messed Up,"There is nothing bad to say about this album, except that when I bought it as MP3, the track names are all wrong. The songs are in the right sequence, but the names don't match. If this gets fixed somebody should tell me and I'll fix this review.Here is the proper ordering of the names:Good With GunsI Love BobAzaleaIt's Not HappeningBall PeenStupidJulia PastranaDisapointedHer Father Was A SailorWe All Love Peanut ButterAll Tomorrow's PartiesGo-Go KittyMr. SuperloveHey SwiftyEleven ElevenThank You For The RosesRide RamonaFingers FallIs It Blood?NemoLaughing At The GhostsSome Kind Of FunNot HappyPeanut"
2,This game really sucks,"It doesn't play like the TV game at all.First of all there is no input into the game (to write). Therefore there are no strikes. All of the answers are written down via a dry eraser board. There are only 5 answers for each category and each team writes down their top five.Unlike the show there isn't a way to steal the score. This game is minimally fun and my family is done forever after only playing 2 complete games (which take about 10 minutes each)This DVD game reminded me of OUTBURST, but not nearly as fun."
1,"dont be fooled by the cover, exactly the same as squeeze the complete workout","If you have a copy of the squeeze, the complete workout dont waste your money as it is exactly the same workout but they just changed the cover. I was so disappointed because i preordered and had to wait almost 2 months to find out that i had the workout already. if i had known this i wouldnt have wasted my money but i am now defintely going to return it an get a refund"
5,Love the workout,"I just love this workout; in fact, I am online ordering a second copy for my sister as a gift. The workout is very effective--you will feel sore, and you will feel results, especially in your outer thighs and stomach/waist area. As another reviewer mentioned, this is floor/modified barre work, so it's not about aerobics or weight training, but you will be amazed at how heavy 3 pounds feels when Tracy puts you through her workout--I usually lift 10-18 lbs with my upper body, and this is still killer--in a good way!!!! I love it. Highly Recommend"
5,Ghostly Fun!,"This game is Amazing, of course it's no Socom 2 or Madden 2004, but it is a great (and challenging) game. The Graphics are amazing, and the depth the makers went into is very intreguing. It's very challenging to figure out all of the puzzles and little mind games that this game throws at you. I bought this game the Friday after it was released and as soon as I popped it into the PS2 I was hooked. It's Addictive, challenging (not to mention scary). All in all this is a GREAT game, it's been worth every penny. If you love thrills and love shooting games, THIS GAME WAS MADE FOR YOU!"
2,Missed the mark on this one.,"Missed the mark on this one. The game is pretty straight forward and frankly a bit boring. Your goal is to catch ghosts and that's about it. The character is limited to jumping, shooting, and sucking up ghosts. The character movement is rather rigid. The graphic are ok. There are some nice touches like the ghosts that appear but other than that the graphics are average at best. The camera might drive you nuts (did me) as it spins everything around you instead of smoothing looking ahead of you. All in all it's really a rather boring game and so is the character. If you want to play a great family game get Wallace & Gromit Project Zoo."
2,Not Worth $50,"Three words: Stink, stank, stunk! Thank goodness I rented it for the family before buying it!"
1,Shipping,"Please let me know why this has not shipped yet. It was ordered on 8/26 and it is now 8/31 and your system shows the item in stock but not shipped. If it was shipped yesturday, I would receive it on Septemebr 1st. It is due to me on September 1st.Jabsco 45490-1000 Marine Waste Tank Y-Valve"
5,HVAC Fundementals book,This book is full of GREAT information. There is a lot of information that didn't pertain to my job but it's a good buy none the less.
1,I love Billy but this is bad,"I am a huge Billy Blanks fan. I have 16 of his Tae Bo DVDs and have greatly enjoyed them. This Funk DVD sadly came as a very big disappointment. The set was not the format I was used to with his usual ""crew"", rather, it was large with many more people. Some of the crew were lacking the positive engery that is usually put forth in Tae Bo videos that keep it fresh and fun. The sound was a little poor and the funky moves were not really all that different from the usual moves. Billy was fantastic at ""funking"" the moves up in slow time; he really looked great and funky but when the fast time count comes, the moves are more or less the old tae bo moves. I normally am pushed physically during Billy's work outs, but I barely broke a sweat. If you have high expectations like I did, you may not enjoy this video."
1,Extremely disappointed,"This is an awful workout. I was very disappointed when doing this. I could only do 15 minutes of this before I turned it off. My heart rate did not go up (I wear a heart rate monitor), and I did not break a sweat. Silly moves, and Billy contantly yelling ""Rock IT!"" made this a disappointment. Billy, what were you thinking when you made this?????"
5,Once in a While,This album is Ray Price soft and gentle..Because of you.. Mona Lisa.You'll never Know..all these are the best of his romantic songs and true classics.. they are timeless.
2,First-time mom-to-be,"If your belly or skin gets rashes when it's oily or overheat with clothes covered, I wouldn not recommend this product. This product, as it mentioned on the lable, would not absorb, so it stayed oily and sticky on my belly. After covered by clothes for a day or two, my belly broke out reashes all over.It smells good though."
2,"Greasy, sticky, and gritty","I was not very happy with this product. The butter is very thick and extremely greasy. I would only put this on at night, because I didn't mind so much if my pajamas stuck to it (it is very sticky). I would never use it during the day under normal clothes for fear of staining. The butter is also really gritty and grainy. My tummy did not like it because as soon as I started to use the butter, my belly broke out with little bumps all over it. The only pros are that it is thick and it stays on your skin for a long time, but the cons out way the pros. I will not purchase this butter again. I can't say if it works at preventing stretch marks since I used it early on in my pregnancy."
3,slightly greasey,"Good product, but I like Momma Mio better, not as greasey, so you can wear it under clothes"
1,Yuck!,"I bought this product because I could not find the Burt's Bees Belly Butter anywhere. This product is so greasy...didn't even want to get dresses after putting it on! The Burt's Bees product is soooo much better, but can't be found anywhere!"
4,"nice, no stretch marks yet!","It smells nice, and seems to work,plus it has an anti-itch ingredient as well. The only negative is it's quite greasy."
5,the best result- clear tummy~,"I got bella b tummy honey butter and lotion as gifts from my girl friends, since she has nice experience with using these products, so do I.I start to use it from my first trimester, almost everyday. now is one month after my labor. my tummy looks so clear:) no stretch mark, even though, my tummy stretched from 24inches, to 42 inches! it is soimpressive, i'd like to recommend to all my friend and families!"
4,Thick and sticky...recommended for night use only,"I am in my 7th month, and I have no stretch marks (yet). It is said that their appearance is mostly determined by genetics, but I feel like I help mother nature if I use a cream.I only use this butter before going to bed. It is quite thick and sticky, and would not wear it during the day when I am at work.During the day, I use the much lighterMustela Stretch Marks Double Action - 5.07 oz.. This one is more expensive, but allows me to wear my daily clothes without staining or stickiness."
1,Terrible!,"I bought this as a desperate attempt to prevent further stretch marks during my second pregnancy. In addition to my stretch marks, my skin was extra dry and itchy so I was hoping this product would do the trick (as it says on the container it ""soothes itching""). The ""honey butter"" felt more like sand paper. The consistency was petroleum jelly like but very grainy as well. For that reason, I hated applying it onto my skin. I would have at least endured through the pain of putting it on my skin if it somewhat helped my condition but it did NOTHING for me. After a week, I ended up buying the Belli brand instead."
2,Not impressed,"To be fair, I have to say I didn't stick with this product for the long haul. Given its thick, grainy, beeswax-like consistency, I'm not sure I could stand it. I started using this when I was 2 months pregnant and now, at 3 1/2 months, I'm already completely out. A little really doesn't go a long way in this case, though I did use the product sparingly.On a positive note, the smell is amazing. It's sweet and not overpowering. However, scent alone is not enough to draw me back in for a new canister. For now, I plan on sticking to tried and true products like plain old cocoa butter which are less expensive and easily absorb into the skin, unlike Bella B's sticky, grainy residue. As far as whether this stuff prevents stretch marks, guess I will never know! :)"
2,Liked this product in the beginning...,I liked this product for the first 10 days or so. After that it was no longer smooth even though I always put it on clean skin. Now when I first put it on is is grainy. After it is absorbed it is fine but the applying process is less than desireable.
5,Anit-Stretchmark Cream for sure!!,"I used this cream starting at the begining of my second trimester. I put it on right after showering. If I ever forgot, I had itching within 3 hours!! I didn't get any stretchmarks!! I also took some other peoples advice and applied it to my hips and bottom (besides my belly). I recommend it to every prego woman!"
5,Tummy Honey Butter really works,"It smells good, and so far, there are no stretch marks. It costs a bit to buy, but it lasts long so it's worth it. Overall, pretty happy I bought this for my pregnancy."
2,Smells good...,"I thought this product was great at first, it smelled great and used mostly natural ingredients compared to other creams, but upon continued use I just noticed it would make my skin really itchy and dry. Which is surprising because the container states that it is hypoallergenic and has an Anti-itch Formula. It wasn't moisturizing or anti- itching at all!"
5,Only tummy butter my husband likes!,This is the only brand/type of tummy butter my husband likes. It smells great and goes on easily! Love it!
3,Seller & Product are GREAT!,"Thank you Nortech for you speedy services and great price. Bella B Tummy Honey Butter was packaged well and brand new!I just got the product today and have used it once. I can tell you this- I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF! Also, even though I have just used the product once, my dry hands feel moisturized without that ""greasy, slippery"" feeling that other lotions or Vaseline stuff leave. Great job Nortech and Bella B Tummy Honey Butter!I gave only 3 stars because I haven't used the PRODUCT enough yet to give it 5."
4,Bella B Tummy Honey Butter,"I've only used this a few times so far and it seems like an ok product. It smells good, but is a little greasy. I read some reviews before purchasing it so had an idea what it might be like. I've only used it at night before bed so the greasiness doesn't bother me too much. If you're looking for more of a cream, I wouldn't get this product, but if you're just looking for something that might help prevent stretch marks, I would give it a try. I haven't used it enough to know if it will really help with the stretch marks though."
3,Good but expensive,"I've been using this for a little over a month and I don't think there are any new stretch marks, but I'm not sure if its helping my older ones like some of the other reviews have said. I use it about twice a day. Also its almost over, so I'm guessing its good for about 2"
4,Pretty Darn Good,I really like this stuff so far. I put it on at night because yes it's kinda ........ ick under clothes. I haven't hit the end of my pregnancy so I can't say about stretch marks. I can say it sure helps me sleep because my belly isn't itchy at all.
1,Got Stretch Marks Used Since 12 Weeks,I used this product from 12 weeks. At 34 weeks I started getting stretch marks. This product did not help with stretch marks. :(
2,Ok...,In my experience is too thick and difficult to massage into the skin. Didn't mind the smell. I'm not big enough yet to tell if works for stretch marks. Also there is not much product into the container.
1,"very fragrant, made me itchy.",For me the scent of this tummy butter is overpowering and it made my already itchy belly even itchier. It definitely was not effective for me.
2,Bella B Tommy Honey,I had great expectations from this item based on the reviews...after I tried it I was really disappointed. This product is GREASY like hell! After 20 minutes I still can't put my shirt over my belly. My skin just never absorbs it. I always have this sweaty feeling. It smells good/ok though.
1,greasy and sticky,"I did not mean rude, but I really do not like this product. It is very greasy and hard to obsorb. And it is funny, last night my tummy was not itchy before I put this product on, but after I had this product on my tummy, it started itchy for hours... So I had to wash it off and put on the other product that I have, and the itchy feeling went away. It is very greasy and sticky. It does have a pleasant smell and the ingrediants are mostly organic and vege-based."
1,Strong perfum smell and sticky,"This stuff smells like very strong flowery perfume. It also does not melt and dissolve like butter. It pulled my skin a bit and left a tacky like surface (like honey would) even after a few hours. Not soothing on already taunt skin at all. I plan on sending this back. I wish they would at the very least allow the cocoa, shea butter and aloe smells to come through. This stuff will drown out any perfume you're wearing. I liked EArth Mama Stretch Oil and Bio Oil better mixed with a bit of raw Coconut Oil."
2,Not worth the money!,I used this a couple of times during my pregnancy and fealt more itchey and ended up with a rash. I swithced to cocoa butter and had better results. I triend it again and ended up with a rash again. Now that I'm no longer pregnant I tried it again and it just made my skin dry and itchy. Don't wast your money!!!
2,Awful texture,While this product smells nice the texture is very grainy. It also does not provide any relief for itching at all. As far as stretch mark prevention I guess it works okay as so far I have not seen any stretch marks on my body and I'm 5 months along.
3,"Decent, but leaves sticky / tacky feeling skin","I like this product overall, but it leaves my belly tacky to the touch. I find that it doesn't absorb and remains 'sticky' until I shower. I personally don't mind it, although my boyfriend doesn't like my ""sticky belly"". All in all, it's probably what makes the product effective, however, I'm shopping for alternatives that leave my skin more supple and soft instead of feeling like it has a thin layer of glue stick that hasn't dried. I have to totally disagree with how ""strong"" the scent is. It says lightly scented, and it absolutely is. I would say this type of product comes down to personal preference - and although its not for me, I would still recommend it based on its effectiveness. I would just note the consistency, and the fact I feel like I have to wash my hands before I touch my face or anything else after I apply it."
4,best belly product i've tried,it is great. light scent. alleviates itching. makes skin really soft. just bought my 4th tub. i wish they made it in a bigger size.
4,"A LITTLE sticky, but great otherwise!","I love this belly butter and the only problem I have with it is that it's a little thick and sticky, but I easily rectify that by putting it on at the end of my shower so that it spreads more evenly and thinly. That's my only complaint, because it works well, it smells great and most importantly (to me anyway) it's paraben- and phthalate-free! <3 Out of all the brands I've used and smelled, this one is definitely my favorite as far as the scent. It's light and fresh. I would recommend this to anyone with a baby bump. They say only genetics can determine whether you get stretch marks or not, but this belly butter definitely stops the itchy uncomfortable feeling and is worth a try!"
2,Stretch Marks :(,I bought this hoping it would keep me from getting stretch marks but unfortunately I ended up with a few. I didn't use this product everyday because it left my tummy feeling really greasy and I was worried it would ruin my clothes. It smells ok and who knows if I didn't use it at all I might have ended up with a lot more stretch marks.
5,Love it!,"I've been using this since the very beginning of my pregnancy and I'm now 37 weeks along. I was worried that it might stain my clothes, but it hasn't at all! Its very light, and keeps my skin moisturized literally all day long (unlike most other lotions/creams). I got some stretch marks during my first pregnancy but haven't noticed any new ones this time around....of course you won't really know until the skin isn't stretched. It has a nice light scent. I used one container about every 2 months in the beginning and now that my belly is huge I use about 1 container per month. I love this product!"
3,Definitely not the same product as the original one :(,"I bought the original TUMMY HONEY BUTTER for my first pregnancy and it was really an answer to my prayers. This was in 2008, this time I purchased it again hoping that the product is the same as the original one but not! This new product has a different scent and the quality of the butter is more let's say, less ""natural"" than the previous one who literally smells and feels like honey, I really loved the previous product, I still have some of it and still enjoy it. I wonder if they still sell the original product somewhere, I need to do the research now. I will use this one I bought, but sure there is a difference between both butters. What the heck with this new people, can't they tell the previous formula is better!"
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF!,"I love this stuff. It is silky smooth and makes my skin so soft. I'm 31 weeks pregnant and don't have a single stretch mark! I do still have some itchiness, but I can't imagine how itchy I would be without using this. I also love that it is all natural and doesn't contain lanolin or parabens. In terms of greasiness, it is thicker and greasier than a normal body lotion, and it doesn't rub in completely, but this makes me feel like it's staying on my skin and working. My work around for this is simply to wear a light cami or undershirt under my normal top."
2,Wouldn't recommend,I did not like this product at all. Too sticky and tacky. It stuck to everything I wore to bed. It also had a gritty texture to it. I do not plan on buying this product again. The Mama Mio Tummy butter is much better.
1,"Read the reviews, purchased it, then REGRET ever buying it","With all the good reviews and hype about it you would think Bella B Tummy Honey Butter would work. Stretch mark prevention? More like a drunken challenge with stretch mark to a vicious battle and losing badly. It felt greasy on my skin, my clothes got greasy and even though I washed my hands it felt like the grease would never go away. For all I know I could have been rubbing lard on my tummy. My skin felt itchy from all the stretching and adding grease to the itchy tummy just made it difficult to scratch. I've used it since I was 3 months pregnant and still came out of the pregnancy with warrior scars. I know stretch marks are genetic but I was hoping this would at least soothe the itch away. It didn't.The only thing I liked about the Bella B Tummy Honey Butter was that it smelled nice. It reminded me of Anthropologie or Urban Outfitters candles.*I'll post up my embarrassing zebra patterned tummy later on."
1,I Couldn't Figure it out -,"I LOVED this Tummy Butter when I was pregnant with my little baby, so I ordered it again when we got pregnant with our 2nd. But now when I put it on at night it seems to be extra grainy and won't absorb. It also gave me a rash (I figured maybe skin was just irritated at first), and most of all has made me ITCHY. I couldn't believe it was doing exactly what it is supposed to prevent, and couldn't figure out why it doesn't seem to be what I thought it was. When I just read the review that states Bella B was bought out and has different ingredients, it all makes sense. So disappointing. Will not re-order or purchase other products from this brand."
2,too perfumy and sticky - don't like,"the fragrance is overpowering for me. was looking for a product without artificial fragrance (phthalates), didn't catch that this has them. if you put the product on at night, it still smells strongly in the morning. i had to wash my skin and clothes to stop smelling it. I didn't like the texture either; it's heavy and waxy and sticky and i just felt gross with it on. :-( a friend bought me some palmer's cocoal butter skin oil from the drugstore, and i like that better. i thought i'd like this more because it costs more - was just a waste of money!"
2,"A little stinky, a little greasy.","I'm really not terribly happy with the product. I had been using Palmer's Tummy Butter (half the price at Walmart) and decided to try this instead and have been disappointed. It's super greasy, I find the smell a bit chemically and unpleasantly floral, and more than anything, it really doesn't have much staying power. Pros: less itching. I really do prefer Palmer's for the price and the quality."
5,love this butter,Loved this butter. Goes on without a strong smell. Feels greasy at first but absorbs quickly. Helped with itching and stretch mark prevention.
5,Love it,"With my first pregnancy, I used a cocoa butter based cream on my belly for itching/stretch marks, but wasn't thrilled with the results. It helped with the itching, but I still got stretch marks and I really didn't care for the smell. So, with my second pregnancy, I decided to find something better. I researched and read reviews and decided on the Bella B Tummy Honey Butter. I love it. I have no new stretch marks to date and it's fading the existing ones from my first pregnancy. The texture is definitely different than what you've used in the past - much drier and you have to work to rub it in. I really like the light floral smell too, and I've got a very sensitive pregnant nose. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone who asks"
5,Best stretch mark cream for the price,"I started using this with my first pregnancy at about 12 weeks and was so happy with the product I used it with my second pregnancy also. Some people say that getting stretch marks is genetic and that if you have the genes to get them there is nothing you can do to prevent it. This is not true. I have stretch marks from growing during adolescence and also got some small stretch marks during my first pregnancy in places I didn't use the honey butter. My only complaint about the product is that it does leave your skin feeling kind of sticky but I'm sure there is no way to get around that since the product works by keeping all layers of your skin moist. I also believe the success of the product is dependent upon consistency in use. I applied it 2 times a day, every day and never got any stretch marks where I used it. I used about 4 tubs of tummy honey butter for each pregnancy and feel it was totally worth the investment. I plan on using it again for my 3rd."
1,Do not buy!,"I had high hopes for this butter going by reviews but I was very disappointed. The rub is oily, I felt like it never really got absobed into the skin. There is also a 'grainy' consistency to it so hours later I would my tummy still covered in 'bits' unlike exfoliation rubs where the beads usually absorb. There isn't a scent which is great if you don't want a scented item but I just felt like I was being lathered in lard!! I have since tried 'Lamaze belly rub' and definitely recommend that one a hundred times over. It leaves a soft, silky feel to your skin, has a pleasant smell and best of all - no grainy bits!! I used this butter in my 4-5th month of pregnancy. I'm now in my 7th using the lamaze rub and I'll never go back to this Bella B product!"
4,So far it is a great product,I have been using this product in my 6th and 7th month. So far I am loving it. 2 more months and I will know if it really stood the test of time.
3,good if you don't develop an allergy to it,"I bought this for my wife, based on the multitude of nice reviews. She used it for a month, then developed a rash, which resolved with discontinuing the cream. Now using a calendula cream as thick, oily and very slowly to non-absorbable as the Bella B honey butter, and she has no problems. I guess it was a reaction not necessary related to the thickness of the cream as another reviewer suggested (heat rash), but rather to the ingredients (allergy?).3 stars for nice smell, consistency, felt good until developed rash. I guess if you are not allergic to it, it's a great cream.Update: I didn't even see that there is another review from today on the same subject :) I guess my wife is not the only one with an itchy belly due to this cream. They must be doing something wrong with the formula; I'll use it on my cracked heels and see what happens."
2,ick,"After reading all the positive reviews, I was excited to use this product. I think it would be better described as a salve, it is thick and sticky, difficult to spread on, and just sits there, leaving your belly sticky, and your shirt then sticks to your belly. Its kind of really gross. I only put it on at bedtime, because it really soils your shirt, and the smell is just too strong and perfumey for this pregnant nose! Really dissapointed with this product, and will be going back to the cocoa butter which moisturizes well and doesnt leave such an oily and uncomfortable residue."
4,Product smells great,"The product has a nice, light scent. It's a bit sticky, but it coats my tummy, which is what it's supposed to do. I haven't had a stretch mark yet and I'm just at 28 weeks."
4,"Nice smell; helps with itches, but leaves skin oily","I am currently using this product because I developed really itchy skin in early pregnancy. It helps, but the product leaves my legs feeling sort of oily. The smell is light, so it doesn't set me off since my nose is really sensitive right now.The butter is almost the consistency of Vasoline."
2,Forgettable,"Considering Groom's talents as a writer, I was disappointed in this book. I got so bored with it that I practically had to make myself finish it. The campaign itself is a very interesting one, but the book does not read that way. That being said, the book does serve as a decent introduction to the Army of Tennessee and the campaign, but just is not in-depth or compelling enough for most buffs, I would think. This book is useful as a start, but if you find yourself interested in the campaign after this book, move on to Wiley Sword's The Confederacy's Last Hurrah."
4,Shroud of GloryIt is,It is a great book to tell what happen after the Battle of Atlanta and Confederate Army led by Gen. Hood. We hear a lot about Sherman and the March to the Sea and the Lee's surrender to Grant but not of the march to Nashville. It is well written and reads like a novel rather than a history book.
3,Good but not Great,I enjoyed this account of Confederate General John Bell Hood's ill-fated campaign to drive the Federals out of Tennessee and salvage a desperately needed victory for the South at the end of 1864. These late-war battles have been mostly overshadowed by earlier more well-known engagements and Mr Groom does a good job of describing the sequence of events that resulted in the utter destruction of the Army of Tennessee.
2,Very Cheap...,Very cheap. materials are cheap and very flimsy. would not recommend it for fuel. reminds me of the giant pixy stix powder candy.
2,Way too small,The pajamas arrived timely and were as described. Style and construction seemed good. I had ordered my normal size but these pj's were way too small and so I sent them back.
3,good,short sleeve advocate! light weight and good looking for travel; great for extra for guest wear.
1,No Effect @ All,"I have these dark undereye circles for many years. This is just one of the products that I tried promising to solve my problem. I have been using it for a couple of months now and I don't see any good effect at all. Worse, it looks like my undereye area has gone darker."
4,Yamaha 5 CD changer,"Easy to set up, does random play, looks good with the rest of my system and has a nice sound quality."
2,Didn't work the best for me,"I think this bra would work better for someone with a larger bust size than mine. I ordered a 32b, which fit ok, but the shape of the bra gives me a more pointy shape under a shirt than I would have liked. I think it is because it squishes my chest very close in. I ended up ordering another brand of sports bra that is on its way."
5,The first style change for a long time. Just phenominal!,With DIRECT Vangelis went to a more musical style including more rock elements. The highpoint of this style became eminent in 1492. After that Voices and Oceanic gave way for his forth change after Aphrodites Child. Direct has phenominal brilliance and transparancy. Eclectic until the last second!
2,"Cookie-cutter, watered down Vangelis","DIRECT is full of shortcatchy tunes, with plenty of pop appeal andtoe-tapping fun, and an easy-on-the-earcommercial 80's metallic rock edge.Your typical lush and romanticVangelis sound right? Of course, no!I have nothing against a composerredefining himself; on the contrary it isone of the reasons that I am constantlydrawn back to his music: who would haveexpected after Heaven and Hell he woulddo Beaubourg? Or, Invisible Connectionson the heels of Soil Festivities?Or that after Voices, wouldcome the deeply impassioned El Greco?Certainly these surprisesare what make Vangelis a force tobe reckoned with. But DIRECTblights almost everything that makes him unique.If I found myself enjoying this I would probablyhate all his other music; it would seembizarre and unappealing.Up against commercial radiomusic, it's a five-star item. For what Vangeliscan really do, it doesn't satisfy.I am very glad he never returned tothis watered down style."
1,Book sponsored by a drug company.....,"This book was sponsored by a drug company promoting their Hormone Replacement Therapy agenda. Post Women's Health Initiative (WHI) findings, this book is a laughable marketing attempt to sell estrogen as the designer drug that wil keep you beautiful, feminine and young.Estrogen/ Progestin combined therapy was initially studied for its efficacy in preventing heart disease and osteoroposis, and not evaluated for its youth and beauty enhancing value. It was found not to be effective and to be even harmful in the treatment of heart disease."
5,Fantastic and Interesting,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. History is not normally my interest, but the author did a brilliant job giving the background of what was going on at each interval - politically, religiously, philosophically - so that you could totally understand the importance of Franklin's discoveries and how forward thinking he really was. I recommend this book to anyone!"
3,Stealing God's Thunder : Benjamin Franklin's Lightning Rod and the Invention of America,"Interesting, but I expected more on Franklin's scientific discoveries and less on the politics of the time. The politics have been very adequately covered elsewhere."
2,CAUTION! Truncated versions of some tracks,"Note that this reissue has shorter versions of at least two key tracks. Both ""I'll Stay"" and ""Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts"" are each cut short by about three minutes. It's a real bummer for the serious P-funk fan... While the sound on this reissue is cleaner, the EQ seems soft and lacks the strong 'punch' of the previous issue of this title. I am unsure if this is a result of too much high end, not enough bass, or what... While the artwork is an improvement, the bonus tracks do not offer anything that was not already available on Music For My Mother.This is an awsome album - however I cannot recomend this version... Seek out the previous issue. On Amazon this older listing does not include 'remastered' in the title (however the sound is great)."
2,bad remaster,"I have the original lp and it is one of my favorite in the Funkadelic catalog. I don't know what happened when they remastered it, but they did shorten 2 tracks in the process, ""Good Thoughts Bad Thoughts"" and ""I'll Stay ""are both edited down in track length. Also ""Sexy Ways"" is also sounding bad. The chorus now drowns out the track. It isn't like that on the lp or the original cd issue. The big plus with all the reissues are the liner notes and photos. Do not buy this ""remastered"" cd. I hope the flaws are fixed on future printings."
4,Good times funk album.,"""Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts"" is one of the best songs I've ever heard. This album is a great feel-good funk album with lots of funny improvs and great songs."
1,Worst. iPod Player. EVER.,"This is singularly the worst iPod player I've ever encountered. I purchased it for use at work, and it's given me nothing but headaches. The main problems center around the remote, which to say is unresponsive would be putting it mildly. Most buttons have to be hit at least twice to do what you want, and it's not unusual for a button to do the exact opposite of its intended purpose. Then, every few songs or so, when you're skipping ahead or back, it makes this BRRR! sound followed by a high-pitched whine, and takes several seconds before proceeding to the next song.I'm extremely sorry I purchased this device, and I would strongly advise others from making the same mistake."
1,DO NOT BUY,I purchased the iwake for my daughter in November. Although it worked well for the first 3 months after that the buttons just stopped working. For instance you would place the iPod in the docking station and hit the power on button... nothing would happen. All of the buttons would not work. You could not set the time or anything. Please do not buy this piece of junk.
2,A few things you should know...,"(1) The face of the clock is very bright, even on the dim setting.It's like having a nightlight, so may be fine for a child's room.(2) The alarm is a bit annoying, as it increases in loudness every five seconds. (Mine is across the room, so I have to hurry to turn it off)(3) The worst complaint is that there is a high-pitch buzzing sound that comes from the unit-mostly the plug! It drives my husband nuts, so if you have sesitive hearing, it's not for you."
2,background noise?!,"I have had this unit for a couple years, still works, but I'm now looking for something else. I had an ipod video and switched to a touch. With the video, when playing music, i would here a beep in the background every 30 secs, didn't quite bother me, was unnoticeable at high volume. With the touch, every 5 secs i here static. If the screen is lit, more static, and if you have a program running just constant static. I would like to listen to music when i go to sleep but the thing makes too much background noise!"
4,pop,"Here is a classic of ""pop"" music, boucny and fresh with lyrics that must be listened to with a sharp mind. The longings of teen angst and perspective are laid out as if on a palette. There is power in this performance, enough to offset the sad fact that it ends too soon."
3,Jellyfish with weaker lyrics and a little less music ability,The music is good pop. Most of the songs try to be funny about sex. Very Jellyfish.
3,At The Crossroads Broadened My Ecumenical Knowledge,"I read ""At the Crossroads"" at the beach last week and amazed myself that I got so involved with the four nuns. Never having any experience with the Catholic church, schools, or nuns for that matter, I wasn't sure how much I would identify. Well, I learned a lot and really did get involved with the characters because Schelly is such a good writer. I'm glad I gave myself that opportunity."
5,Praise from a non-Catholic,"Even though I am not a Catholic, I found this book to be engrossing - to read of the struggles of Catholic sisters to find their own identity is pertinent for all women. The story gets more engaging as it goes on, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in contemporary woman's issues and challenges, especially those with a Catholic upbringing."
5,Praise for Frankie Schelly's At the Crossroads,"...a primer for authors who want to present beautifully drawn, human and sympathetic characters in a setting unfamiliar to most.The quietly stated dilemmas touch our hearts and make us pull for each protagonist separately and in the aggregate."
4,At the Crossroads,"This book made me want to laugh, to cry and to admire the dignity and resolution of the characters. It certainly gave me an insight into the workings of the convent, the Church and the individuals involved. Read it, it's a treat!"
3,As accurate as tomorrow's weather,"While the rerouting feature usually works fairly well, the accuracy of where there is traffic is horrible. I have come across accidents that weren't on the system and driven through red and yellow zones where there was no slowing. This product is a good start at a great idea, but the up-to-the-minute traffic info is still a ways off, aparently."
1,Bad description on Amazon,"I don't know how this device works, because I can't install it in my German car. Amazon fails to say you need a special connector for European cars, which costs $50. Amazon also fails to say you will need to spend $60 a year, after the first 15 months, to subscribe to a traffic radio service that will make this device work. If you travel a lot, you may need to spend $60 many times over to get the radio signals in different cities. Misleading advertising!"
5,something good has occurred,"the origninality of this release dominates. hard to label, refreshingly. jazz, spoken-word, dub, beats, electronic, acoustic.it uses major chicago players (members from town & country, isotope 217, tortoise, etc.), without sounding like another chicago record"
2,Low Quality,"I've had this notebook a couple days and it's already starting to fall apart. The ring is unwinding, and there are no slits on the dividers to put papers in. Would not purchase"
4,Cutter,I'm impressed with the fabric cutting of this tool. We have two of them! We do a lot of charity work with fleece blankets.
3,rotary scissors,"This is my first pair of rotary scissors. Maybe I will get better as I use them but I leave patches uncut. I do know that once I get accustomed to using them, cutting fabric will be a lot faster and neater."
4,The Best Band You've Never Heard,"IRA's Sparkle in the Finish is the kind of disc that grabs your attention and doesn't let go. To listen to Sparkle is like taking a roadtrip with your friends. You're everwhere Ike is during the entire CD and you don't mind at all. Ike lyrical skills rival the greats, this boy can write a song. One listen to ""Garbage Day"" or ""I Don't Want What you got Goin' on"" will have you hooked.Do yourself a favor, buy Salesmen and Racist while you're at it. And, see the band live when you get the chance. You won't regret it."
4,Bonus Tracks make it very good,"Couple of exc. tracks from original album combined with tasty bonus material makes this worth getting, though after Reflections and scores of other stuff!"
2,Not one of Garcia's finest,Save your money folks. This Cd is probably the worst studio CD that Garcia put out. Pick up Garcia or Reflections instead
5,Great witch costume accessory!,"A witch always needs a cool hat and the huge spider and web adornments were awesome. However, I wish the ribbon had been orange rather than maroon. I really liked the texture as well as the shape of the brim. The veil added a hint of mystery. The overall effect was spooky but not too scary."
4,Best of one of the best,"Question : How can a ""Best of"" of an artist that is among the finest contemporary classical composers of our era be a let-off? Answer : it can't. As the pieces that were collected were chosen from his most ""accessible"" work, this is in fact a must for everybody. The only disadvantage I get with Wim Mertens is I keep thinking ""what ad was this piece in?"", as the classy music has been recycled so many times over the years by advertising agencies all over the world."
3,Odd book,"This book describes an important day, to be sure, and does so with careful research into all that is known about that particular day. Unfortunately, there isn't quite enough known to make a whole book out of, and the author is forced to pad the book with seemingly irrelevant details like the barometric readings of each hour of the day, simply because these facts are available. A little bit of the book necessarily seems like speculation, and reads like fiction - ""he wiped his forehead"" or some such unknown detail. Where it sticks to first-hand accounts of what happened that day, the book is a welcome triumph and an amusing read for obsessed fans."
3,For Beatlemaniacs only,"Well, I'll throw a little water on all these gushing reviews. As I waded through all the minutia details in this book, it struck me that were I not a hard core Beatle devotee I would be bored to tears. But, for all you true Beatlemaniacs out there this book has real value as an addition to your collection. I was especially interested in the few pages at toward the end where Paul plays in front of the Quarrymen and makes such an impression on John."
3,"Entertaining, and not traditional","Maybe the author just wanted to work on her character development skills rather than construct a traditional novel -- I don't know. If so, she did a fine job. Most anyone who has lived in (or comes from) a small Southern town could think of people who resembled the characters in this book. The thought processes, the dialogue, were all on target. -- Are all of the characters likeable? No. But neither are many of the people we know.The revelation in the last section took me by surprise. It had never crossed my mind as I read the book. If you're looking for a good story with a satisfying ending, you'll need to look elsewhere; but if you're looking for reading entertainment, then you should enjoy this book. Some of the characters will stay with you long after you finish the last page."
5,a story that will stay with you.,"this book is short, easy to read, and funny in a real understated way, so i didn't expect to keep thinking about it (especially the ending) long after I finished reading it. my book club read and discussed it, and many of us felt the same way. the characters were colorful and interesting, especially aunt della. it's different than any of the books the book club has read lately, but we really enjoyed it."
2,I hated two of the characters in this book so much it hurt,"My hat is off to Cassandra King. It is hard to write characters that make you want to punch them in the face, but with Ellis and Donnette, mission achieved. I listened to this book on a long solitary road trip, and Taylor and Aunt Della (the more sympathetic characters) were engaging, as were the villans, but this is an unlikable, unhappy story. It does haunt you, and if you're looking for a tale of white trash revenge (where trash triumphs and solid morality is swept under the rug in exchange for immaturity, paranoia, and possessiveness), you've found it. Otherwise, I'd stay away.A note about the audio book - the story is told from different perspectives, and it was wonderful to have the different actors reading the different parts. The voicing of Della and Donnette was especially strong."
2,Run from this tidal wave....,"Nicely written details about small town Alabama. The author's end notes say that she tried to write about the special bonds of friendship between males. Instead, she ended up overshadowing that story with the story of two vile, scheming, and manipulative small-town women doing whatever it took to get their way; the touching, developing, story of Tim and Taylor was kicked aside. The sudden and inexplicable ""ending"" didn't really resolve anything...I was left feeling cheated out of resolution.I've heard nice things about Ms. King's writing. This was my first exposure to her work and will try another of her books. Maybe I just started with the wrong one?"
2,Making Waves,"I felt as if I were reading a book for teens - the plot was thin and continued to hold one theme as the central ""mystery"" or glue to hold the story together. It was tiresome and even the ending was a disappointment. The author wrote in southern cliche's which failed to bring humor to a tiresome, drug out subject.Unlike the author's book Sunday Wife - it seemed to fail in it's delivery."
4,Book Club selection,Our club recently read this book and we had a great review session. I personally felt there were just too many secondary characters. It was an easy read though once I figured out the characters. Donnette was quite the character but ended being very strong.
3,kindle book selection,"The story was okay. I did not care for how it ended at all. This book was not one of my favorite, but I thought the theme of the book through out was interesting. I don't believe I would order another book by Cassandra King, but then again, they cannot all be rated with 5 stars."
2,Not Her Best,"While I'm a fan of Brenda Joyce, this book was too drawn out with angst. I agree with everyone else that it took much too long for the characters to get together. By the end of the book, I was so worn out from the characters, that I finished the book with much relief. I was more interested though in the secondary story with Jon and Catherine. I like my characters to have a few bumps in their relationship, but Violette and Blake had a mountain and a half. I wouldn't recommend this one so quickly. Splendor is much better."
2,Not her best work,"I LOVE Brenda Joyce, but this book was the least entertaining. The plot moved too slowly, and was a jumble of misunderstandings. Not enough romantic scenes that Joyce is famous for either."
2,Finer Things,Unfortunately this is the worst book of Brenda Joyce's I have read. You are more than half way through the book before the characters actually get together. Wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
3,Could have been better,"I agree with the other reviewers this wasn't Brenda Joyce's best book, however, it wasn't that bad... as a matter of fact I thought the beginning was really good but toward the end she rushed everything. I thought the best part of the book was when she talked about Anne and Dom from ""Beyond Scandal,"" which was a lot better than ""Finer Things."" I would recommend that book a lot more than this but you should read this if you have nothing better to do or/and want to know what happened to Dom and Anne."
3,Not Her Best,"The Finer Things was deffinatly not one of Brenda Joyce's better books. But, I did read it front to back. I kept waiting for the two main characters to get together and it was a little frustrating. I would suggest you read any one of the many other Brenda Joyce books....she has so many good ones. I have read worse. Just not by Brenda Joyce."
2,Whats the point?,I already owned a Platypus 3L hydration bag. Bought this only to find the connector would not work with the one I had. Not to worry though you can simply take the end nozzle and switch it out which is easier anyway. In the end I paid $12 for a tiny bit of plastic that I may or may not use. The nozzle works well...... But in my opinion I wasted my money. Use a washcloth and some water.
5,POWERFUL AND POLITICALLY INCORRECT!,"The author pulls no punches as he explains why most workers are miserable, most bosses are incompetent, and most corporations will ALWAYS be run by men, despite all the you've-come-a-long-way-baby cheerleading by the liberal media. If you're a smart, ambitious woman (or man) who has the guts to accept the unvarnished truth about the workplace, THIS BOOK CAN HELP YOU BECOME FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT."
2,Happy Birthday Mom,"Okay, let me explain the title. I call this review Happy Birthday Mom because in the middle of the movie i stopped the movie to call my mom and wish her a happy birthday. The typical thought would be that I bought this dvd for my mother as a birthday gift, but I do like my mom, so I wouldn't do that to her. Later in the movie I also stopped it to talk to my friend that lives in Canada. Yeah, I stopped it to talk to a CANADIAN, thats bad.... Well he's just up there for school, so ya know.Some of it was good, but it could have done better. I have the seemingly harder to come by skill of seperating fiction (movie, game, tv) from real life, so I like the kind of shat that upsets fragile people without that skill. I'm sure some of the violence in this movie made someone cry foul....And its gets and extra half star simply because Kari Wuhrer is hot in this movie, like every movie she's in!!"
3,Not all baldwins are good...,"all in all a good low budget movie. the only thing i found annoying is daniel baldwin.. he should try taking acting advise from alec baldwin, not steal his voice and try to act like him....daniel baldwin sucks!!!"
2,Direct to DVD for a reason.,"It looked like the director and writer wanted to take this right past the sanity curve, but the producer wimped out. This could have been a cult classic if they had pushed the visions but they chose to sink back into mediocrity. Do not buy or rent this one, borrow it or do the netflix thing."
2,Interesting but Disturbing,"I was a little misled by the synopsis on the back of the cover and not really familiar with Stuart Gordon's work. I usually like unpopular ""different"" types of movies, the kind the mainstream audience wouldn't think to watch, but this was definitely not my type of movie. It started off good and had some good familiar actors like George Wendt ""Norm"" from ""Cheers"" and Daniel Baldwin, as interesting characters along with some good newcomers. Some of the scenes were slow moving and kinda boring but overall I was getting into the movie.....until the beating and hallucination scene's. I was so disturbed by the end of that sequence that I had to turn off the movie and couldn't watch any more. Usually I'll watch anything, but those images just stay with you and won't leave. VERY INTENSE. I guess the bottom line is if your not familiar with Stuart Gordon's work, you'll probably be in for a surprise!"
2,What I think,I don't think it's worth your $ if your looking for something to take away dark circles. It is a good moisturizer & does not interfere with makeup. Indent have puffy eyes so I can't say if it helps with that.
2,didn't work at all,"I bought this to get rid of the crow's feet and fine lines under my eyes. I've used this now for about three months with absolutely no improvement whatsoever. It is pleasant to use and doesn't irritate my eyes, but just didn't do a thing for me."
5,Pyle PPRC-J05 Professional Dual RCA to Dual 1/4-Inch Cable (5 Feet),"First class professional quality audio cable designed to take the abuse of handling and movement of cable such as a DJ, etc. Excellent color coding and cord keepers. Shipped very fast from Amazon using ""Super Saving Shipping""."
3,Not Too Bad,"Buy Hosa Cables, this is a LIGHT DUTY small wire gauge, for the same price buy Hosa,they are ALOT better"
2,"Terrible, Low Quality Cables",Not a fan of these cables at all. I have had better quality out of RadioShack brand. The cable gauge is very low quality and they are very thin cables. Don't be fooled by the image attached with this product as the plug connectors are very low quality as well. The casing seems very cheap and doesn't stay secured. The cables are not gold plated really at all. Only a fraction of the TRS and RCA is gold plated and they sound terrible. Save your money and buy just about anything else.
2,Too expensive for plastic product,"I love Kanekichi BN5 Turning Slicer, you can make lot of vegetable garnishing but cost is too expensive for Plastic product,"
1,Cheap,"This is unbelievably overpriced. It is a cheap, plastic item that is difficult to hold and work. It would slide by at $19.00. This is garbage."
1,taken aback,I was shocked to see the substandard craftsmanship of the product. The cost of the item is ridiculously over priced.
3,Great slicer!,"Love the slicer's ability and it's blade options! I use the medium blade to spin zuccini as an alternative to having pasta (the zuccini looks just like spaghetti and it's gluten-free!) The plastic seems a little flimsy for the price I paid ($73), so I'm having doubts about how long it will last. Expensive for what you get. I would look for a cheaper option considering the quality of construction. I can just see this breaking if my husband used it a few times."
3,"Innovative, but over-priced","This is a very innovative gadget. It will turn any firm vegetable (eggplant, e.g.) into spaghetti-like strands that can be deep-fried and plated for a stunning effect. It has several different serrated blades, so the dimension of the strands can be changed. The base and most of the components for this device are light-weight plastic. Although the Kanekichi is cleverly engineered, placing a vegetable in the 'sled' and turning the handle, I found I had to apply some pressure to get it to move through the blades - a little awkward since the device is light enough to slide around on the table top. Also, anything moderatly 'squishy' isn't going to work well. This does seem sturdier than the Joyce Chen model, based on reviews of the latter. However at $75, the Kanekichi is seriously over-priced, unless you're truly desparate for a device that will turn vegetables into attractive ribbons."
5,"great, inexpensine cane!","After using several orthopedic canes, some from noted manufactuers in Europe, this one is the winner. All things considered- adjustability, tensile strength, fit and cost- make this cane the best I've encountered.Dr Thomas InmanAlameda"
4,I still love this debut!,"Taylor Dayne's first album came out on Jan. 19, 1988, though they printed 1987 on the album. Bur this was a dynamic debut! She had such a soulful voice here. At times, she sounds like Mariah Carey did on her 1990 album. But this album also was one of Ric Wake's first hits as a producer; the same guy that would later do Mariah, Celine, Jennifer, and dozens of other artists. I still love the title song and Prove Your Love. But I still love I'll Always Love You, which sounds like it could have been recorded in Atlanta. Don't Rush Me didn't hit until 1989, so it was another hit in its own right. But I like other numbers like the sassy Want Ads and Where Does That Boy Hang Out. She has such an R&B voice that reminds you of the soul singers of back when. Her next album was more rock driven, very Tina Turner-ish, than this pop debut, but this debut really was dynamite all the way through!"
5,Flash in the pan,"Taylor Dayne came out with her first album while I was living in Japan. I actually discovered her music from Japanese friends. They loved it and so did I. When I returned to the US I looked for more of her music and ran out of choices fast. It seems that there were a lot of artists, and good ones at that, who got into the business to make their fortunes and get out. Wish she would have stuck around. She had some great music."
3,"3 1/2 stars, a pretty good debut album","I bought this album along with her second album, ""Can't Fight Fate"". I actually enjoyed her sophmore album a whole lot more than this one, and judging by the other reviews I guess that makes me somewhat of a minority. The title-track and ""Upon the Journey's End"" are the two best songs. The rest of the songs on here range from mediocre to pretty good. This is a pretty good debut.3 1/2 stars/ 5"
5,Love this item!,"This is a wonderful product. Using this product makes my hair shiny, silky to the touch, and very manageable. I use it when blow drying or with a straightener and it comes out beautifully. Can't beat that price."
4,Love my comforter set,I love this product and have checked the web site to see if they have any other sets that I may be intrested in purchasing.
4,Nice set,"I received a king size but I thought I ordered the queen because I only have a full size bed. So, now I either have to return the product, or buy a queen or king size bed. What would you do?"
3,It's Okay for the Price,"I got gold color but it didn't meet my expectation. The quality is okay for the price, which was about 70% off the regular price, but I wouldn't pay for the full price. The heel design is sort of odd and gives me feeling unstable at times."
3,not for students,"This is a teacher's manual with lessons plans. Besides the required manipulatives, you will also need a student activity book."
1,The date in the description doesn't match the pictured item.,"Make sure to check the edition year you need before buying! The description says 1987, which is NOT the year of the edition that is pictured here on this listing! I ordered without noticing that small detail. I gave it one star, because it is a misleading product posting - I can't rate the prodcut that I THOUGHT I was buying (based on the picture), because that is not what I received."
4,A Refreshing Fun Game for All Ages!,"I was quite surprised with how fun the game was - it's not too scary that the kids cannot play, but it's scary enough that I get chills down my spine when those darn spiders come jumping out! Lots of exploring around the mansion to gather the lost souls with the help of the Madame in the globe, and meet other friendly ghosts....Animation is not bad, voice and sound is pretty darn good, the only objection - the locked controls - sometimes very frustrating! But overall, this is a great game! Hope the movie will be as good as the game! :)"
4,Hurry Back!,"This game is a must for fans of the ride. It is fortunately not based on the movie, but rather the ride itself.The game captures much of the whimsical ""spirit"" of the ride with just enough moments of eeriness to keep things interesting. This is primarily a puzzle game with each new room presenting a different problem in order to complete it.There isn't much in the way of the ride's music except during the credits, but there are plenty of nods to the Disneyland version of the ride.There are also a few annoying levels that once finished, you are glad you don't have to go through them again. However, the lure of the next room and the next puzzle overrides this.This game may prove a bit short for highly skilled older gamers, but a pleasant diversion nonetheless."
4,Awesome!,"this is a very, very cool game. its really scary too...wouldn't recommend it for young children. for people that like a good haunt and lots of action, this is the game for them. (great graphics + sound!)"
4,One of the Greatest Games That is Disney Based,"I first saw (and played) this game at Disneyland before it was released. It takes a while to get the hang of, but once you do this is an awsome game. It does get startling at times, so young kids might get freaked out. Other than that, it's a great game."
1,Poor Mount,"Nice little light, lightweight, bright. The major downfall is the mount/strap system. For the life of me, it will not stay put. About every fifty feet(on the road) the light rotates 90 degrees straight down. I end up having to tighten the strap before every night ride and constantly adjust during my ride. I ride in the city so I just use it for others to see me. I could not depend on it to navigate my way through the darkness. I have consulted with the directions/diagram that were included, to no avail. There is a certain way to 'thread' the strap through the mount and around the handlebars. It's just a silly design. A well thought out light, but a poorly executed mount. Foolish me, I bought two. One for myself and one for my wife. Both are the same.One star b/c it's such a mindless flaw."
4,Bright versatile light with flimsy mounting,"This is a very nice light - it's extremely bright and lighter than many of its counterparts. It has solid and flashing modes, which are nice. It is also adjustable, so you don't have to mount it some place that is facing straight forward or at a 90 degree angle to where you want the light to point.The only minus is its mounting strap. Yes, this may be nice for putting it on your helmet. I don't want it on my helmet - I want it on my handlebars. It's hard to get it on there snugly, and even if you do you might have to adjust it a few times, only to take it off when you get to your destination. If it's raining or snowing this only makes your handlebars slick and it's even more difficult to mount the light.It's still better than average, a good deal, and I would probably buy it again."
4,A Good One to See,I watched this movie and really got caught up in the twist and turns of the plot. I think it is a good one to see.
1,Forget this one!,"Last night I was going through my movies searching for one to loan to a friend. In the process, I cam across this little gem and did not remember anything about it. I had to fast-forward through parts of it to refresh my memory. I refreshed my memory. This movie is dreadful and a waste of time. I have trashed it. It was just taking up room in my collection. I am lost for a redeeming word to say about it."
5,A feel good movie,Some good acting here.And I really enjoyed this very relevant movie.Also great to see Karma at work here.Think that most guys will be able to relate to this movie
2,Could have been better,"2 or 3 stars? I really could not decide.Whirlwind is nothing special. Mediocre actors with a less than mediocre script and a very predictable ending.There are far better films out there than this.If you're looking for good-looking guys on film, this film has a few, but the film could have been far better in many ways.Worthy of a re-watch? No."
4,Pretty decent Entertainment,This is generally a good and entertaining film. The subject matter is very true to fact in general to today's lives but even more so in the time period the movie portrays.
3,DISAPPOINTING!!!,"The concept of the movie is great, but I wish I could say the same for the acting it was pretty terrible. I really like the fact that there was an interracial couple in the moive you don't see that vry often especially in gay movies. what i didn't like is even though at the end the couple got back together, the group of friends remained friends it didn't matter Drake accomplished what he set out to do the cutie cheated on his hottie boyfriend, so in the end Drake was right...."
3,Just ok,"Many slow points in this movie. Some pretty unrealistic scenarios as well, I thought. Overall I'd give it a C+, but it definitely was not worth the $23."
3,Review,"Thiz Movie'z OK. Nothin outta thiz wurrld. Certain controversial topics R brought up; inturr-racial relationships, infidelity, etc. I enjoyed that the character'z weren't all N their 20'z, it was a nyze change.*~R~*"
5,Highly Readable....Demystifies Complex Issues,"As someone who knows little about business and economics, I found this book really interesting and timely. From Third World to World Class links together many of the dominant themes of our era - globalization, technology, markets, and the rise of new world powers. With force and conviction, Marber explains the positive economic and financial transformation that will affect the world in the coming decades. Many of the current headlines we read - ever-changing technology, Asia's financial crises, nuclear proliferation in the Third World, China's growing importance - are all discussed historically and relative to the big picture he paints. With scholar eyes and trader sensibilities, Marber is to be applauded for his upbeat, accessible book on some of the more complex issues of our time."
3,There are other volumes that stand out in my mind...,"This is PSoH, so I can't say that I *didn't* like this book.But I can't say I really liked it either.It's unfortunate that this volume was such a let down. After being positively thrilled by volume 3, I was anxious to see what would happen next. Unfortunately I was treated to some rather empty and--heaven forbid--boring stories. ""Dracula"" was probably the best, and the ""Flowers & The Detective Pt.1"" was mildly entertaining. All the stories seemed rather underdeveloped or rushed, and really didn't do much for the continuity of the story.Another nag I had with this volume was the constant punctuation mistakes in the sub-texts (and since there's lots of subtext, this is very noticiable). Hopefully TokyoPop will reissue this volume later with corrections.If you're new to PSoH, pleeease don't base your opinion of the series on this book. Check out one of the previous volumes and come back to this one when you simply need more of Leon and Count D ~_^."
2,Shipped with imperfection on rim,"These are a gift, so I can't speak yet to the effect of the glass on the wine. But I am disappointed that one of the two glasses I received the other day has a slight imperfection on the rim. Almost seems like a small sliver of the glass was either chipped or not smoothed out correctly. It's noticeable only when you run your finger over it."
1,Font changes make book practically unreadable,"The random font changes throughout this book are simply ghastly, making the book practically unreadable and detracting from the seriousness of the topic.Much better are: ""What Smart Teenagers Know...About Dating, Relationships & Sex"" by Deborah Hatchell, ""The Guy Book"" by J. Mavis, and my 15 year-old son's choice, ""Doing it Right"" by B. Pardes."
2,Teenage Guys survival guide,This book needs to have an age range. I will not be giving this to my son until he is about 15 or 16. I found some of the topics too explicit for the average teenager.
2,Really Useless,"I bought this book thinking it would be helpful, but i was wrong. It is pretty much saying that girlfreinds and kissing are what most guys are concerned about. How does the person who wrote this know what a guys every thought is, we have more than sex going on in our heads! And they talk way more about mastrubation and how to do it than about potential risks when having sex (STDs) (Pregnacy. But then they try to be the ""good guys"" and tell you that rape is bad (of course it is but they really don't care, they just don't want to seem so ignorant to whoever is reading the book.) If you want your son to have exxcesive erections, and desiare sex more than ever, Waste 8 bucks and get ready to become a grandparent. Ovbiosly, i am alot smarter than whoever wrote this and I am younger than 18."
3,GROWING UP!,"Parents should read this book first then share it with their teenage children. It covers the first date, first kiss anxiety and awkwardness, and moves on into puberty, sex,committment, depression, and drugs. Solutions offered are positive. Information is presented in detail and with occasional humor. Parents you can help your children transcend the growing up process more smoothly. This ""survival guide"" is a good start."
5,Mom! God! You're weird for buying this for me!,"That's the phrase I heard from my son when I gave this to him. He also informed me that his cousin, whom I also gave this book to, thinks I'm weird. But guess what?? THEY ARE READING IT!So does it bother me to be the weird mom/aunt? Heck no! This book is very informative and gives them the info in a humor-filled and age appropriate way. It's an easy read.I suggest parents read it through first and address issues as they see fit."
4,good reading,"I bought this for my 14 year old son who was having a tough time with typical teenage issues. He read the whole thing in one sitting, I heard him laugh out loud a few times. and when he was finished it he said it was ""pretty cool"". I was glad I bought it and will pass it to my next son when he enters this phase."
5,LED light,Item delivered quickly and efficently. All seems to work well and is a very neat little item. Will be useful. Thank you.
2,not very bright,"The amount of light this puts out is very very little. If you actually want to illuminate an area, get something bigger."
2,Not a lot of light...,"... and concentrated to only the front of the light. For instance, one could not stick it on the back of a headboard and read a book unless your headboard was at same angle as your book."
1,practically useless,"I wanted to use these spots for under cabinet lighting in my home office. The amount of light produced is so minimal, they are useless. I can't imagine an application where they would be helpful."
3,"Great light, but dosn't stick well in my truck","These are great little lights. They put out a lot of bright light for their size. However, I stuck two of them to the inside of my truck's bed cover. They stuck for about two days before they fell off. So, I would not recommend using them in a place that gets a lot of movement.I accidentally ran over one of them. It did not break the bulbs or the cover, but it did bent the metal case such that I could not turn it off. I have not tried to disassemble the unit to see if I can bend the case back such that it will start working again."
2,Weak Sauce,"I bought a couple of these, and based on hype expected them to be something special. They are not. The light is similar to that from a head lamp. It won't light up a closet or dark corner very well. I'm not sure what you would use it for. It might actually make a nice tent light."
3,"Nice, but not quite what I'd hoped for.....","I ordered these to use under my kitchen cabinets and provide just that extra light needed when cooking. I really didn't want to wire halogen lights under the cabinets, and these looked like they would fit the bill. Sadly, I was wrong. They do work just as described, but think more like NIGHT LIGHT not BRIGHT LIGHT. It was a pretty big disappointment to rip open the package and stick the light on the cabinet and have this pretty direct beam shine onto my countertops. Really wasn't what I was expecting."
2,"Great night light, not much good for anything else","I bought two of these for under my cabinets in the kitchen. I might as well have not even installed one. It made no difference whatsoever in lighting my cutting board. So I put the other one in the bedroom, makes a great night light. I didn't really need another night light; I needed task lighting in my kitchen."
2,Use is limited,"My old cabin of a house has no lighting in the closets. I thought this might be the answer, but it was only a partial answer. The special adhesive doesn't do well on polished wood, so the light kept falling off the closet wall. I solved this by putting a small square of hook and loop on it. Because of its size, it doesn't provide a great deal of illumination; I can see the tops of my garments, but not the shoes on the floor. I could add a couple more lights, but don't want to have to turn on 3 or 4 lights (including one at the bottom), find my clothes, then turn them all off again. I am still considering purchasing a couple more for under-shelf task lighting at the office. They work, but think about where you want to use them before buying."
2,Not the hue or beam of light i was expecting,"I bought these for a small china cabinet. I wanted a light under each shelf to softly light up the inside without having to hook up wiring.I actually hate the light that these create. The beam is VERY concentrated (a small, very distingishable beam. I am not sure what type of application would benefit from a concentrated 2 inch beam of light but anywhere requiring general lighting isn't a good place for these lights.Also, the light it casts is blue-ish (what I guess they meant by bright white?). It is a very unflattering hue-more blue-ish than flourescent.They seem pretty useless to me and are going back today!"
2,"Lights are bright, but very small illumination area","I bought six Sylvania DOT-it lights to stick underneath my kitchen cabinets to illuminate the countertop. I was sorely disappointed because the lights were bright, but only illuminated a six inch circle of countertop. Thankfully, the sticky mounting surface does pull free with ease so I took them down without wrecking my cabinets. These lights are a great IDEA but fell short of my expectations."
2,doesn't want to stick,"The light is handy and rather bright, but the adhesive that came on the light does not hold it in place for long. I ended up putting double sided tape on the back to use it over my sink."
4,A great advancment in lighting!,"I buoght two of these for my closset and i have to say i'm extremly impressed. With a quick tap they limuniate a suprisingly large area. They have adhesive sitckers on their backs that you just peel off and plob them on the wall. The batteries are stored under the light and a conection with them is made only while the light is on eliminating the ambient power draw that some lights have. I have not tried to take one off my wall yet so i don't know how well the ""pull it off and stick it back up again and again"" works or if it does at all. My only neg is that the batteries seem very hard to replace, this is why 4 stars. Just a final note Menards sells these for $8."
5,Very Handy,"i dont use this for purposes that have been noted for places in home, i have this literally attached to my backpack so i can quickly turn it on or off for outdoor use. And i must say, it works great and has a good range that even comes in handy while bike riding. Comes with 3 AAA's and has lasted 6 full nights for me. I am going to buy a couple more for handy sake."
3,The push button mechanism is little stiff,"Works exactly as advertised. I found the button slightly stiff, however, it's quite handy in my closet."
2,A bit clunky,Long lasting LED's for sure. I don't find the round shape useful and the switch can take some determination.
1,Not worth it,"These lamps aren't all they are cracked up to be. Each barely puts out enough light to make them useful in any application. I used them in a glass lined display case for some rock specimens I have and they barely illuminated an area 1' x 2' x 2' (and I used TWO of them!!). A regular D cell flashlight provides better illumination. Additionaly, the light is a harsh white as compared to the normal 'warm' light one gets from a standard incandescent bulb. I suppose there might be some applications these would be well suited for but using them for display cabinets or under cabinet lighting will surely disappoint."
2,Took Paint Off the Wall,"They're cute, and I thought they'd be great for the frequent winter power outages where I live. I stuck one on the bathroom wall. A few hours later I went to reposition it, and it took a big chip of paint off the wall when I pulled it off. So beware of where you stick these things!"
1,NOT WORTH IT,I bought two of these tap-lights to use in a small closet - in the winter it was hard to see everything clearly. I received them today and neither of them tapped on and the screw to remove the back is so small that I don't have a Phillips screw driver to even take off the back and replace the batteries - the ones that are supposed to be included - and working. I will be returning this product.
1,not good for closets,This light is bright but not good for general lighting in a closet.Once stuck on the wall it did not want to come off screwing up our wall.
2,Smaller than I expected,"I thought these lights would be good for my daughter to put in her dorm room locker so she could see her clothes without turning on the overhead light and awaking her roommate. Unfortunately, they're a little too small to serve for this purpose. They'd be better used as a path light to the bathroom, for example."
2,Misleading,These lights are not as bright as they are advertised to be - and I've had several die on me in a very short span of time. Very disappointed with this product.
3,"good light, bad back ""sticky""","I was using it in the kitchen, but the sticky would not stick underneith my cabinet. The light would be great as a night light, but not a major source of light"
3,Sylvania DOT - works great,Thought it was a package of 3 for the $9 but received one. The one works great but have seen them in packages of 3 which would have been a great buy. Thank you.
1,Don't buy this,"First, it does not work and it is NOT easy to remove once you stick it on a surface.Second, I have seen them in stores in packs of 3 for under $10 so paying $8 for one on Amazon was just crazy; I should have shopped around first!"
2,dim lite,The light is very blue white and not very bright. You have to pull it off the surface it is glued to to replace the batteries. I wouldn't buy them again.
2,Mediocre at Best,"This light gives of a small pool of low intesity light. I stuck them under my cabinets, hoping to give the counter tops a little more light. They didn't. Some lights were a little stronger than others, but none were worth the price. The didn't stick very well either. I cleaned the surface before adhearing them just as the directions said to, but it didn't help. Not worth the money."
1,Good Idea - Bad Application,"I bought 2 of these lights in January. One didn't work from the first. The second one fell off the wall (multiple times) within a month. But it really didn't matter if it stayed on the wall or not because it added almost NO light to my closet. Better luck next time, Sylvania."
2,"Not very bright, dissappointed in this product","I bought several of these lights and am dissapointed in their light output. It took three, not one, to illuminate a shelf in my laundry room. I would have returned them if not for the restocking charge and return shipping costs. They do allow a long battery life."
4,Functional,"Very bright, very functional, very efficient. Thanks for the quick service (it was efficient too)!"
2,DOT Lights,The DOT Lights do not stick very well under kitchen cabinets. They also do not provide enough light for cooking. They are a good idea they just need to be improved in sticking and strength.
2,IronBrigade,I put a couple of these lights on the underside of my kitchen cabinets to add some additional task lighting. Unfortunately these lights simply are too dim to add any useable lighting.
1,DO NOT BUY! Mine broke immediately!,"For one thing, it gives off very little light. If you are in the dark and use one of these, it's next to useless.To make matters worse, mine only works if I hold the button in. I can't click it and keep it on.What a waste of money."
4,Not as bright as you'd wish,"The size is right, the colors are cute, but I expected with an LED that the light would be brighter. I'm using them in my 1959 trailer to help fill in some of the dark spaces and it's better than the previous iteration of tap lights, not as obtrusive and ugly. But almost more a ""mood light"" than a useful light."
2,not very useful,"I bought these lights intending to use them in my closet, and for underneath cabinets in the kitchen. These lights don't put out enough light for them to be useful for anything I wanted to use them for. The only thing they might be good for is to place in your glove compartment, or any very small area. Also, the battery does not last very long, and the lights don't stick very well to surfaces."
4,Some pluses and minuses...,"For the most part, I really like my DOT-it lights. The light on these is bright enough for me to see all the way to the back of my large closet. I was happy that they already came with batteries, so I was able to use them right away. Unfortunately, you have to unstick it and unscrew three screws on the back of the light in order to replace the batteries. Also, I ordered the lime colored ones, and they are really an icky bile color."
3,"bright light, good for small spaces, not a pernantent solution",I stuck this in a closet (apprx 3ft x 2ft) on a overhead painted surface. The light lit the area poorly (would work better in small space) and one day (within 2 weeks) it was not hanging overhead. I fould it among the shoes on the floor. The stickyness was not enough to be used overhead in my situation.
2,100 hours of light per set of batteries? Hah!,"Try 10 hours of useable (that you can read by) light, and perhaps 25 hours of any light at all. But then comes the real fun - changing the batteries. AAA batteries are easy to find these days, and I had plenty in stock when the time came. But the three phillips head screws that keep the light together are an odd size. None of the many phillips head screwdrivers in the house fit it, not even my computer sized ones or the ones I had to fix sunglasses (the screws are somewhere inbetween those two sizes). If I have to buy a screwdriver to change the batteries on one light, it's not worth my time. Especially if that light doesn't even work as advertised."
2,Needs to be brighter,Don't buy this if you want to illuminate anything more than 10 inches from where you place the light. I put 2 in a free standing wardrobe and they really don't help.
3,Enjoyed these,"and they were bright for me, but I found that the adhesive wouldn't let the paper come off to adhere is to anything. So I've just used it as a flashlight and as a booklight when the lights are off so I don't bother my husband at night. I would imagine that if these were to be used as kitchen underlighting, then you'd have to clean the area first to make sure there as no residual cooking grease to keep it from sticking...if the paper would come off. I threw the instructions away (dumb) before I needed to replace the batteries and so will have to figure that out. But at least I can easily hide this light from my husband and kids who can never find where they left their own flashlights and want to ""borrow"" another (one to leave somewhere they'll never be found again!)."
3,not too bright,This is not a super bright light. I have it in my laundry room but it is not very helpful
4,Neat Gadget,Acts more as a flashlight than an area illumination. Which is OK if you need another flashlight and no more illumination in closets.
4,easy to use,"These little dots work great and stick anywhere. The light is very bright, watch you don't blind yourself. I sometimes have a little difficulty pressing so the light stays on but usually after 1 try it's fine."
2,Little practical use,"Dispite an attractive design, this product has few practical uses. The light output is poor, and very blue. It's essesntially a battery powered night light, that gets very dim after a short period of time. Then the batteries have to be replaced. It was a disappointment, even at $5.00."
2,Great light but glue won't hold up,"The light looks great and works fine, but the sticky stuff on the back is not strong enough to hold it in place. I had to use epoxy glue, which means I will have to break it free when the batteries have to be replaced. Product needs a few holes in the rim so you can screw it in place."
1,Useless,Sounded like a great idea. So I ordered 2 of them. Neither one worked.NOT very impressive!!!
3,Nice but not quite right,"I love the design, colors and size of this product. I needed these lights for my closet, so I wouldn't disturb my husband while sleeping. The lights stick well without issue but they aren't as bright as I hoped. I think they would work better in a smaller area, such a cabinet or smaller dimension such as a coat closet or even a work box. It would also be a good night light for the bathroom maybe."
3,Its not too bright but sufficient for my use,I use it to highlight stuff in my art niche. Cheaper than hardwiring real potlights. A 5 LED design would be much better.
2,not remotely bright enough,"I bought 3 for above the sink. Even with all 3 turned on, it isn't bright enough. All these really do is offer mood lighting. To make things worse, the light isn't white but rather a very light blue."
5,"hey ma LOOK, no wires!!!!!",After remodeling the kitchen we realized that lights under the cabinets would require some wires to show. This product solved that problem. Great product.
1,Sylvania DOT-it,"The DOT-it did not stick under my kitchen cabinet, nor on the wall of my closet. The light was a blue tint and ""cold"". I had ordered 3. I returned 2 un-opened packages."
1,this stinks !!!,THIS LIGHT ONLY LASTS 3 NIGHTS.APPROX. 8 HOURS PER NIGHT.24 HOURS GRAND TOTAL.BETTER HAVE LOTS OF BATTERIES.
2,"Was great at first, then not so wonderful.","When I got this to put in the closet, I was very pleased: the light was bright, easy to use and it was easy to stick to the wall.However, the brightness does not last! You have to change the batteries every couple of months, even if using alkalines, to get a bright light. The color of the LEDs is a little off, too.So I could only recommend this as an emergency light or somewhere where you won't use it very often.And under no circumstances forget to turn it out and leave it burning overnight!"
4,hits the spot,"I really like this little spot light, it lights up just enough to see what you need. but I think they could have come up with another way to make it stick to where ever you needed it to stick, makes it a little difficult to replace the batteries, I just put on some velcro and now it's easier to move to a different place if you change you mind but all and all it does the job."
2,It doesn't stick well,"I tried to use it on my car trunk but it doesn't stick well, especially in warm temperature. Another not so useful junk in my garage."
2,Sylvania Dot-it Self Adhesive Bright White LED,"Was expecting a lot more from these. The purpose of my purchase was to add additional light to a bi-fold door closet. Found I needed at least 6 of them in a 23"" w 7'3"" h section of the closet to provide minimal light at best."
4,Nice Puck Light,"Pros:-No need to call an electrician. No WIRES-Battery last a long time.-You can stick it anywhere you want, great for those odd places where it is impossible to put a regular light.-Great momentary night light-Simple operation. Just tap it on, tap it off.Cons:-Not a lot of light. Just enough so you can see where you are going.-Ghostly color of light. Hard to recognize colors of things that is lit."
1,Does Not Stick to Wall - Keeps falling off,"I have tried two of these. First one I returned because it would not stick to my closet wall, which is painted wood. I cleaned the surface too so it wasn't dirty. I got a replacement, and although it stayed stuck for a month, it too has now just starting popping off. Of course it started doing it after the 30-day return window, so now I'm having to negotiate with Amazon as to whether they will take it back. I think they should because it's the same defect twice.The light itself would have been sufficient for a dark closet, not something you'd want to read by, but it shows the color of your clothes. But as it is always on the floor nowadays, it's pretty useless."
2,Sylvania DOT-IT,"What a great idea for a stick-up! Unfortunately, this item ""smells"" too. The Sylvania DOT-ITs stick where ever you put them, but if you really want to use the led light to ""see"" something; forget it. Put two of these little guys in a dark closet, and it doesn't even illuminate the shelf.If you want to light up something dark, bigger than a tackle-box, get an electric light. The LEDs don't cut it. The price is right, its just too bad the DOT-ITs can't do what they promise.caveat emptor!"
3,"good idea, but not so great product","the dot its are great! a smart idea for sticking a light in a small dark place. however, whoever designed it, really could have made it better...for example, there is adhesive tape on the back where you can stick it where you want to, but the screws to the battery cage are there too...as anyone who has stuck anything up to a wall or door before knows, it is hard to remove from the surface. for the risk of ripping off part of your wall, it is cheaper just to replace the item when the battery goes dead. also, it works well for relatively tiny spaces, anything bigger than 25 sq. ft, it would need a conical shade (like a lamp shade over it) to help emit more light to a greater area. overall, i gave it 3 stars for this reason. it is a great idea, and i do like it--these are just the few flaws i have seen in it."
4,Those Li'l Dot-Its from Sylvania,"Those L'l Dot-Its from Sylvania are great little devices that throw off just enough light so you can see what you are looking for in a closet that was previously pitch-black. Unfortunately, they don't tell you that the ""Pull"" tab isn't just for pulling the device out of the packaging but you have to really ""pull"" the tab out to activate the LEDs. Also, if you ever need to change either batteries or bulbs, I don't know where you would find a screwdriver tiny enough with still enough torque to open the case. I know, I tried until I e-mailed Sylvania and they straightened me out about the pull tabs. But... once they worked, they solved the problem of the deep, dark closets. Not really bright, but, let there be light."
3,Sylvania DOT-it,"Did not light up the area as well as I thought it would, although the batteries lasted longer than I expected."
4,"Very nice, sturdy, but focused light rather than diffused.","all's good with this light - small, sturdy, doesn't use up a lot of batteries. Unfortunately the LEDs give off a focused light, like a flashlight, rather than diffused light like a traditional dome light, so it's less useful in closets where you want to illuminate the whole space and not one spot on the wall.Otherwise, all's good - the light is pleasantly blueish."
2,Not Bright: Agreed!,"Not bright: agreed! From the packaging photograph I imagined/expected a high-performance, low energy consumption L.E.D. tri-light. The intended use was as an ""automobile front cabin dome light."" I would rate actual vs. exptected luminosity at 4 out of 10. Mediocre. Moreover, I placed a dot of superglue to its back and affixed it on the windshield, behind and lower the rearview mirror, otherwise it repeatedly fell; further, it would not adhere to the ""cloth"" car ceiling liner at all. One day I'll remove it, knock it off, use a razor to clean the windshield.Conclusion: I would not buy another.[ Licensed Under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License. --J Bacall ]"
4,"Good Lights, but not really an area light","I bought these to use as area lights. The lights are actually more focused like a flashlight, which I think limits their use as an area light. A frosted lens or other diffuser to spread the light out a bit more would serve me better. That said, I have one in the back of my truck to see the cargo under the cover. I also have one in a cabinet where I have a computer stuffed. It does allow me to see easily in these areas, but it could have been better if the light were less focused."
1,Nice flash light but too dim for anything else,I love the concept and the design but the product falls short. It works great as a flash light but does not give enough light to use for any other purpose.
4,nice product,"Nice product, clever concept, shipping was a little slow but looking at other reviews it appears they took some time off after the holidays, As many people who ordered at the same time I did received items later than thier normal ship time."
3,A good Idea,"Although a good idea, the light is too focused. It has limited application. Great in a camper"
5,great vendor,The Sylvania Dot-It Self-Adhesive Bright White LED light arrived quickly. When one light was defective vendor sent a replacement quickly at no charge. Completely satisfied.
3,Nice idea,"This is a nice idea for adding light in those odd spaces. One warning, the adhesive does not work. I had to use my own double sided tape to keep it from falling."
2,Great idea but doesn't meet expectations,This product is a great idea but it doesn't put off nearly enough light. Also doesn't stick as well as it should. I'm disappointed. Don't waste your money.
4,Very Good Overall,"A very handy item, being compact, easy to mount and easy to turn on and off.My only slight disappointment was that I expected the light to be brighter, but seeing as how these are LEDs and not incandescent bulbs (that require replacement), that is easy to live with. Besides, having at least a LITTLE light where before there was none is still a big improvement. The light is still sufficient for me to see very well all my medicines in an otherwise pitch-dark closet."
3,"OK, not great","I tried under the kitchen cabinet, like a number of others who posted comments and found it similarly insufficient. I then moved it to my coat closet where a dim light is better than no light. Its light output is equivalent to a very small flashlight."
2,not so bright,I thought the light would be bright but it works as if it might work for a night light but not much else
3,Not enough light,"Great idea, they stick where you want them, but don't give off enought light for much of anything."
2,Not worth it...,I was excited about these little lights thinking they would provide a bit of light when I first come into my apt (its pretty dark). The adhesive didn't work well at all. I kept finding the lights on the floor when I returned home. If the adhesive worked it would be such a nice little light!
3,Only in small spaces,"I bought two of these thinking it would be great for a closet that was not wired for lights. These lights are not very powereful, I'd guess they are similar to a night light at 3-7 watts at best, so if you want to get the most benefit from them I'd consider smaller areas like cupbords or cabinets. a small room the size of a closet is too big to really get any benefit from it. Great idea and could be very useful if it were brighter."
2,Only for small areas,This product has great potentail but do not use it for anything larger than inside a small cabinet or cupboard. I bought it for a closet and I'd need at least 4 to give me any workable light at all. It has its purpose but the way they promote it makes you think its much brighter and has many more applications than it does.
3,"Works well, but not very bright","This little stick on lamp works as advertised, but if you're looking for something to read by or light a closet, this won't do the job. It would be great for lighting up a drawer or small niche, but that's about it. With three led's, I am a little dissapointed in the amount of light it casts.Like most LED's, the illumination is a blue-white color. On-off switch works well, and adhesive holds very well. I haven't tried moving it, so I can't vouch for the claim that it can be relocated easily.Not bad for $5 or $6, but not worth the retail price."
3,Not as useful as I thought,"I bought this thinking it would be so useful for my walk-in closet, but it's only slightly useful.It doesn't light up nearly enough area for me and because it doesn't swivel/pivot, I can't focus the light in another location once I've placed it. I decided to try it in another part of my house and stuck it on a painted wall. I didn't think that when I removed it, it was going to take big chunks of paint with it. Now I have a paint touch-up project. Doh!On the positive side, it is pretty well constructed. The surrounding face seems to be made of metal as opposed to plastic (mine's already got a dent in it, but it's better than a crack). I've removed it and reset it several times already and it keeps on sticking."
3,"Self-Adhesive, you bet!","Item looks exactly like picture. Poor design in that it you use self-adhesive back and fasten light to a surface, you cannot change batteries without ripping lamp off surface. And then what? Can you re-stick it? I haven't tried that yet. Also, light is not very bright and should only be used in very small areas."
4,A little light,"It isn't quite as bright as I thought it would be in the space I needed it for. I worry about forgetting to turn it off. But it is better than no light at all, that's for sure."
4,Great Product!,I have recently purchased this product for use in our trade show display (just as a visual enhancement). It worked reliably and looked modern and attractive. The only confusing thing was the picture of its packaging - I truly thought that there were multiple lights in one package.
1,"Let There Be Light, But Not This Kind","I needed more light over the stove, and hardware store recommended this product. Purchased three, and placed them on nice clean, dry, painted surface. No more cajun style pancakes. Dinner that night was stir fry, and what a surprise when the lights fell into the frying pan. The undercounter light fell into the bowl of scrambled eggs. The light output is adequate only for smaller spaces. Stuck to galvanized metal and the Labrador (for a while: he sat on the one that fell on the floor), but not where it was needed. Adhesive has lots of room for improvement. Won't buy them again, and returned these."
4,ShinySilverDagger,"this thing is pretty good, excellent value for money. i realy like the prospect of it lasting for a 100 hours on a single set of batteries!"
2,Insufficent lighting,I bought the lights to use for lighting below the kitchen cabinets which it was recommended for. It didn't meet my expectations as it is defintely not task lighting. Mood lighting is more like it. Shame it wasn't brighter.
3,Just Okay,"We bought two of these lights to go inisde our daughter's playhouse to make it brighter while she plays. Unfortunately, the lights didn't stick well and were entirely too bright and focused. They don't illuminate, rather spotlight, which was not what we were looking for at all."
3,Self-Adhesive Bright White Orange LED Light,"While this is a nice, useful, emergency light, It produces a moderate amount of light. However, it has one major flaw. I guess the designers didn't expect anyone to change the batteries, because this is accomplished by removing the back of the light by removing the screws that hold it in place. Easy, right? Sure, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T USE THE SELF STICK FEATURE! Once you stick the light to a surface, you can't remove the back plate without removing it from the wall, destroying the self-stick pad. Other than this, it's not a bad product."
3,Not much of a lite,"Not much of a light, only lights up a small area, and not very bright, but works for where I put it in a cabinet"
5,Sylvania DOT-it Bright White LED Light,"Works well. Very convenient. By pointing it at the ceiling (indirect lighting), I get a gentle light in the room."
1,LED technology doesn't cut it,"i have a very small closet and bought 4 of these. even in a straight line, side by side, they do not illuminate well. they are dim with a faint glow. too bad, because they are cute and convenient....just don't work as intended!Sylvania 35046 Red and Silver Dot It, Portable LED light, 2-Pack # LED/DOTS/RED/SILV"
2,Dot it Light,"Wasnt too impressed with this little light. First of all, I thought it would have been more than just one in the pack. I must have overlooked that there was just one. A little costly for this. Second thing is that I was looking for something for a small glass-fronted cabinet I have in kitchen to illuminate some nice glasses inside but it has an eerie blueish glow to it like neon or flourenscent so does not compliment this idea. It isnt as bright as you think either. maybe it would be good for a small closet or a babies room when you just want to peek in at night otherwise it is pretty useless to me."
1,"Great lights, but they won't stick!","These little lights would be really handy, but they keep falling off! I put them under a top part of a step back cupboard in my kitchen so there would be a little light on the cupboard top, but they will not stick. I followed the mounting directions, but perhaps they need stickier sticky stuff."
1,Dim bulb,"This is a great idea, but the light it gives off isn't near enough to allow me to see what's in my closet. Nees more oomph!"
2,Poor Battery Life,Doesn't stick once taken down to replace batteries. And the batteries don't last all that long.
4,Hot Latin Jazz/Salsa that produces an intoxicating effect.,"California conguero Poncho Sanchez delievers a strong Latin sound unlike any other Latin Jazz artist out there. ""Fuerte"" (Spanish for strong) is powerfully intense. It is like taking normal salsa and adding a shot of dark rum. This music is the type of music that should accompany an action sequence in a movie. Not only is this album intense, but it also full of positive messages and cacthy refrains. I recommend this to any open-minded person looking for something different."
5,"Classic Midnight Louie, the best!","Midnight Louie is at his best and most lovable in this romp through a murder at a cat show. How he is able to keep his excitable ""Little Doll"" under control and guide her to solving the mystery and other problems is quite engrossing. As always, Louie is the strong character and quite the inimitable tough private cat eye. A well plotted and well written book. Any cat lover and many a non-catlover mystery fan should love this book."
1,do not use this company,"I absolutely would not ever order anything from this company (entirely pets) ever again. I ordered this light over 1 month ago and just received my third light in the mail today. The previous two lights had been broken in a million pieces and the third one, low and behold, is again broken in a million pieces. You would think that a company that sell light bulbs would know how to ship them. All three times, the light has been wrapped in bubble wrap and then placed in a cardboard box without any additional padding-they never changed their packing method even with the second broken light. I am going to call later this evening to get my money back so I don't waste my cell phone minutes. I tried to call this afternoon and gave up after being on hold for 15 minutes without anyone answering the phone.Ridiculous that they cannot ship a product intact and can't get it right after 3 times."
4,Solid effort but not for all Trower fans,"Overall a pretty good album. However fans of Trower's driving/etheral rhythm playing may feel this effort falls a little flat. This represents a dramatic departure from his early albums. For instance, keyboards often take up the slack as Robin concentrates more on improvising. Trower dishes up some very sweet soloing but I expected Trower's straight ahead blues to have more bite in the rhythm section and a little more groove over all."
3,Robin Trower - 'Someday Blues' (V-12),"One thing you can say about Robin Trower is that his place in music is still as relevant now as it was thirty years ago.At least to his true followers.'Someday Blues' is obviously an all-out blues effort and for the first time Mr.Trowers is supplying the vocals.Yes,you read that right.Actually his singing is pretty decent.Fear not,shred-guitar fans,this CD doesn't suffer one bit.All ten cuts are well written and played,with the best being ""Crossroads"",""Feel So Bad"",""Extermination Blues"" and ""Looking For A True Love"".Longtime Trower fans should like this disc and who knows?It could easily draw some new fans.Give it a spin.Enjoy."
1,A dissappointing Trower record,"I'm sorry to say, but I did not like this record at all, pretty drab stuff! I buy every new Trower release because I love the man, but this record bites (sorry Robin)! If you want to get some excellent Trower, try any one of his 70's records or the very very EXCELLENT 20th Century Blues, it will blow you away! Please make another album like 20th century Mr. Trower, this is the music your fans crave!"
3,The whole is less than the sum of its parts,"As both a big-time blues fan and a long-time Trower fan (more than 25 years), I was intrigued to see that Robin had done a straight-up blues album. While Robin's singing is okay and each of the tunes on this album is okay, none of the songs is especially memorable. In fact, the songs all seem to sound about the same, so much so that the repetition makes it fairly monotonous. For that reason, I would best describe the whole as being less than the sum of its parts."
3,Age does weary them,"Maybe my memory is faulty, but I remember some exciting stuff from Robin Trower (none of the records survive however). This effort has some moments, but seems laboured at times. The guitar work is almost always in the high notes and you can hear distortion at times because his pickup is always cranked way up. The album is saved by his slower numbers 'Someday Blues', 'I want you to love me' and particularly 'shining through'.Through Kazaa I rediscovered ""Bridge of Sighs"". This is the ablum I remember and one you should check out first before considering this or any other Trower album."
5,Two of Scorpions Greatest Albumns,"I have been a Scorpions fan since the late '70s and have each of these albums on LP from my original collection. Virgin Killer is one of the most dynamic recordings of the entire Scorpions Collection. It has hard-hitting tunes like Catch Your Train, joined with melodic classics like Yellow Raven. In Trance has equally rockin' tunes that put it in the top 5 best of the Scorpions albums. Although I have not purchased this set, I am truly considering it."
5,uli jon roth is one of the greates guitarist of all time,i just got into the scorpions and all i have to say is that this album is all about uli jon roth he is right up there with hendrix just listen to sun in my hand or drifting sun and prepare to be blown away his style is totally original his tone the Hendrixisms mixed with that Euro-classic style he is my biggest influence
5,Don't Call Us by Sugarloaf,"I hadn't heard some of these songs in over 25 years. It was great. THe CD's arrived quickly, and in perfect condition. Haven't stopped listening since I got it."
2,Are you kidding me?,"Did the other reviewers listen to the same CD? With the exception of ""Don't Call Us, We'll Call You"", this album is ridiculously bad. The live performance of ""Green Eyed Lady"" is rushed and perfunctory.This is one of those I quickly re-sell on Amazon to recoup as much of my misspent money as possible.WARNING - If you, like me, are a big fan of the two songs I mentioned above, be advised that those are probably the ONLY Sugarloaf songs you will ever want to hear more than once."
5,The last and funniest word...,I can't imagine this sorry situation being put into a more humorous or revealing form. Congrats and thanks to the author!
2,"Ok, but not good",It does not remove my Maybelline Waterproof Mascara. The last thing I want to do is really push on the skin around my eyes to remove the mascara - I don't need to stretch it out. This is ok... but not good.
1,Worthless,"Simply put, this eye makeup remover doesn't work. It takes scrubbing to even remove eyeliner, and it does NOTHING for waterproof mascara. I can soak a cotton ball and swipe my lashes, and nothing comes off at all.The only good thing I can say about this product is that it's not greasy feeling. I've used other ""oil free"" makeup removers, but they're still greasy. This one is not. A quick water rinse afterwards and you're fine. There's still makeup all over your eyes, but at least your skin isn't greasy.Other that the lack of grease, there is nothing good to say about this product. It's inexpensive, but it doesn't work, so it's not a good value at any price. And it stings my eyes."
5,Great service and product,This can be purchased at Target for pennies less. I just kept forgetting it every time I walked in the store.I have used Clinique's eye remover in the past and loved it; this is very comparable.
3,Useful but not great,"This make-up remover is just mediocre. It requires some serious elbow-grease to get waterproof mascara off my eyelashes, but I like it for cleaning up around my eyes while I'm doing my make-up in the morning. I use it as a sort-of gentle eraser to perfect my look. If you put some on a q-tip it is good for removing eyeshadow and pencil eyeliner. And it does work decently well on regular mascara. Usually, though, I wash my face and then use this product to take off the final eye make-up residue that is left. Would not buy again, but useful enough for now."
2,Does not remove waterproof mascara,"I bought this one hoping it will remove my waterproof mascara, but it does nothing at all. It removes eye shadow and concealer perfectly, but with the eyeliner is not as smooth. It takes some rubbing to remove eye liner and, as I said before (and stated by other reviewers) it does nothing to your waterproof mascara.Definitely, I won't buy this again."
4,"Mario's dvd,sometimes I Dream","thankyou for inviting me to review this concert, I loved every minute of it and i'm so glad that i bought it, I would recommend it to anyone who loves good singing and I hope to hear much more of mario frangoulis in the future..Thankyou to amazon for stocking and supplying this dvd."
4,A must for Dorsai fans,"If you haven't been introduced to this book, find it. It is a combination of Lost Dorsai and the Spirit of Dorsai with a lot of extra material on the Dorsai and the Childe Cycle as well. I think they are re-releasing Lost Dorsai with the extra information, but I'm not sure, as it's being billed as a new release- or, at least an unpdated version. Having come out in 1986, before Young Bleys or the other latter novels, that is most likely the case. Perhaps it would be wiser to purchase Lost Dorsai with the new info and get Spirit seperately. At any rate, the short stories are still first rate, and they are all about the Dorsai. What more can you ask for?"
2,No substance,"This thin book written by a Holocaust surviver lacks substance and interest. Of the 90 some pages only 30 were devoted to the author's childhood, ghetto experience and concentration time. The rest of the book describes her emotions and that is basically it, her emotions at starting a new life in this country. She tends to repeat herself through the book and it lacks continunity. I am sure she and her husband are very wonderful people but her book is lacking and was disappointing and would have been fine as a memoir for her family and close friends. The print is poor and the photographs as a result are not clearly visible-blurry."
1,Be sure you know what DVD zone you ar buying,"This was most likely my own fault for not reading the fine print, but this DVD is restricted to Zone 15, which means it won't play on my DVD player here in Illinois.If anyone knows how to get around that, I'd love to know."
2,oh we try so hard,"there is nothing in the world that can compare to the depth and complexity of the book. The movie tries hard, with all the histrionics and well meaning ambition that Huston can muster. Albert Finney as the consel is a well meaning if dated choice. The speculation as to his actual sobriety during filming is a nice ancedote, but offers little insight into the day in the life of Firmin. J. Bissette is a poor choice as Yvonne, as she has all the acting ability of a brick, and cannot even pretend to the specifics of the role. Poor at best."
2,Never looked at it after the first time,"I just returned from amsterdam and I brought some internet materials that I printed out (different articles) and two guide books, I never looked at this one while I was there. I dont think it has a lot of really useful information, there just arent a lot of details provided - it feels like it tries to cover too much.My advice would be to decide on what you are interested in doing there: walking, museums, biking... and find for a book that is more directly related to what you are looking for. I feel I wasted my money on this book."
4,Excellent and concise guidebook,"We used this guidebook on our recent 5-day trip to Amsterdam, and were very satisfied with it. It had two excellent maps of the city, which we used constantly. It also pointed us to the most prominent historical and cultural points of interest, and we were able to fit most of them in during our trip. The descriptions in the book were short, but contained enough information for us to tell whether we wanted to visit the places described. If you only get one guidebook to take to Amsterdam, this is a great one."
4,A great introduction to Amsterdam,Great little book. A perfect book to use to get you started in planning your trip to Amsterdam. I loved the top 10s for every neighborhood!
1,Ugh,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSNick Stahl's girlfriend is supposedly raped (not shown). He then kills the person his girlfriend identifies as the rapist (shown only in bits and pieces as a flashback).He is sentenced to a mental institution. The rest of the film shows his interaction with the staff and fellow inmates and we learn more about Nick's issues through flashbacks of his childhood.It this movie is intended to be a realistic drama, it fails miserably. There are a few interesting moments but it feels more like a PG-13/made for television movie that attempts to show the difficulties of lasting guilt.If you're hoping for a realistic story of what life might be like in a mental institution for violent criminals (like I was) you will likely be disappointed."
3,"Not her best,but still a treat","Of all the books that I have read by K. Moning this is the least exciting. I enjoy her dark and torn characters and the way they are brought to life with detail. This book did not seem to come to life for me. Overall, it is a great read but, not as edgy as her other books"
5,Wonderful Escape!,"This was so well written, I absolutely could not wait for kids naptimes, etc so I could 'escape' a bit while reading this story. The characters are well fleshed out, and the scenery as well."
4,Still as delightful as #1 in the series,"I enjoyed the settings and the characters in this book as well, but the romance and emotional conflicts with the characters seemed to be a repeat of #1."
3,AUDIO MUCH BETTER WAY TO GO---,"WAY too much bickering in this book. Still, I enjoyed listening to the narrator, Phil Gigante, while I worked. I would have been miserable if I had tried to read this book myself and moaned over the wasted time."
5,Lovely & Romantic,"I have enjoyed all of Karen Marie Moning's Fever series. Deciding to venture to her Highland series was not a problem. She is an awesome writer. This book is very enjoyable, funny and suspenseful. The romantic interest between Grimm & Jillian is breathtaking and hot. You find yourself on the edge of your seat waiting- holding your breath for the final moments as he truly begins to share his secrets with Jillian. This book is a must for anyone who loves a great romantic story. The conflicts of one man. The love of one woman. The determination of a two fathers. You'll find yourself laughing loudly and heart pounding in this adventurous Scottish tale."
3,I loved her first book,"The heroine's father summoned three men from her past so she could choose a husband from among them. The hero hadn't been back since he'd left her years ago. He was afraid to consumate their love because he couldn't risk loving/hurting her being a beserker. He now tries acting indifferent and I think this ""courtship"" went on way too long in the book and would rather have read more of his family of berserkers instead."
2,"best of the bunch. 2 stars, how sad is that?","I bought all of the books off amazon because I am a huge fan of highlander books. while this was the best of the series, it was still pretty bad. They all pretty much have the same plot. Boy loves girl, girl hates boy, finally they do it, then they are in love. The men are larger than life, the women are emotionally damaged and them men complete their lives. If you liked the outlander series then you will hate these books."
2,So-so Romance,"The language used in some of the conversations was far too modern. It actually made me laugh in some passages because it was so far out of place for the time. I admit, it bothered me more and more as I continued reading.The heroine was pretty one-dimensional. Her only goal was to ""get her man"". Geesh! Get a life! How 'bout a bit more depth to this poor woman?It was a quick read and only mediocre for a romance."
5,Great 2nd book in series,This is a great book also. I would recommend anybody to read this book. I love reading series books & Karen Moning writes great books.
2,the other stories was better,"This one is ok, but I do like Ms.Moning's books so I tried this one also. I don't like this cover.But of course I didn't judge it by it's cover only.. I've read it and I don't know but I think I like the timetraveling themes more and it was fun to read a little and find out more about Adrienne and Hawk.If you like timetraveling try ""Kiss of the highlander"", but ""beyond the highland mist"" was also good.Among the four books this one is the third best I think..."
2,Une déception...,"A voir la cote de ce livre, je m'attendais à beaucoup plus. A franchement parlé, il s'y passe pratiquement rien avant le milieu du livre!! C'est hyper lent comme début, ""comme il est beau, comme elle est belle"" pourrait facilement le résumer. A éviter. Je donne 2 étoiles en raison de la fin (épilogue) qui, peut-tre, est bonne, sans plus."
3,I love Karen Moning,"I love the Highlander series that Karen Moning has written, especially books 4-7, ( I just wish the leading starlets didn't all have to be virgins; but it was good all in the same). And I also love her series with Mac Lane."
5,To Tame a Highland Warrior,"Very HOT read! Very well done, with lots of suspense, & of course ROMANCE like no other books I have found."
2,Disappointing,"While this tome is probably adequate for beginners, it was not the technical reference this experienced developer needed. I got the feeling the authors had never really developed a significant product with FoxPro as they did not discuss much syntax or the nuances of the commands. ""The Hacker's Guide...."" is my book of choice for dealing with FoxPro in the real world."
5,A must for those who need to implement the Windows API!,"Not since the days when Mike Brachman was writing on integrating FoxPro and the Windows API has there been such a clear and concise text. This book as loads of great examples, and most importantly, discusses how to pass structures to Windows API functions that require those type of parameters.This book is a must for any serious Visual FoxPro Developer. Hopefully, the tradition of excellence will continue with a version 7.0 of this book in the future."
5,Great book for non-newbies,This is a great book for people that are already familiar with the Visual FoxPro environment. It provides a no bull approach to using Visual FoxPro for real. It has great coverage of the Windows API and a great set of libraries for Microsoft Office. If you want to learn how to use the advanced features of VFP quickly then this book is for you.
1,Does Prima Tech read the books it publishes?,"The opening paragraph of chapter 1 reads as follows:""There are many ways to distinguish a good software development project from a mediocre one. You can look at the appearance of the screens, the way the application behaves, the structure of the underlying tables, or the source code itself. Each of these items tells you something about the developers who built it.""The finished application, World Wide Shoes, which is included on the CD and purported to be the end result of working through the exercises in this book, speaks volumes about the author and the publisher. The application is amateurish and of poor quality. It represents few of the development standards outlined in the book.I get the feeling the author has studied programming theory, but has done very little application development."
5,It was a awesome product!,"I was searching everything for a facial cream that can keep the moisture all day. and I found this on Amazon which L'oreal was my favorite brand also. So I take a step in and try this. It was so great! Its larger than my expected size and come with very good favor of smell. You can feel its cream are very smooth. Whenever I cleaned my face after the cleaner, few mins go, my face will start feeling dry and uncomfortable. But after I applied this on, wow~ I can say that is very soft. This product non-like others sticky after you put on your face, it's very creamy. People! If you are searching a kind of hydrate facial cream for day and night. You should try this, it's not very expensive. Non like others are expensive but did not worth much! I given 5 stars for this product!I don't give out a review usual, but this one is really good and make me want to share with you guys!"
2,Needed a light moisturizer,"I've bought this before at the drugstore and used it until it was gone. The smell is light, the formula is light; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.Problem is, either they changed the formula or I got a bad batch. Now, even if I apply the thinnest layer to my face, using a dot smaller than the size of a pencil eraser, I get this weird greasy feeling all over. Shortly after that is what I call ""the water stage,"" where as if by magic, my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top. I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel, because it looks like I've worked up a sincere sweat. I don't know what's wrong with this product, and I'm holding onto it to try in the dry winter months, but I'm not optimistic. At this point, I would not order it again."
2,doesn't feel better,"I was so hoping I had found a good moisture cream for everyday and under my make-up but when you first put it on it almost feels like your face begins to perspire and you have to wait awhile to let it absorb, weird! Unfortunately it doesn't feel any better than the inexpensive day creams I've bought in the past. I won't be using very often."
5,Good product,This is a good product which moisturizes well.It is relatively inexpensive and therefore is a good buy for the money.I will buy it again.
4,wonderful smell and texture,"Love the smell and texture of this creme, a very small amount goes a very very long way. The smell is simply clean and makes you feel good, and I am very sensitive towards fragrances in lotions especially on my face.I did try this out under my make up, when i wear my Mac Studio Fix, I prefer to use Mac's prep and prime , as with only the moisturizer it seems to make my make up just a bit uneven, not badly, but i saw a bit of a difference.Might try it under the Prep and Prime as I am not sure if the Prep and Prime will give my dry prone face enough moisture.But i do love using this moisturizer to use with my cinema secrets creme foundation pallet, (must try ladies, and amazing beauty product)Overall I love the creme, will definitely re order, and for my break out sensitive prone skin, no issue either. Definitely recommend"
2,Very disapointed,"I am very disapointed with this product. When I purchase face cream I expect it to have a creamy base, but it is runny almost as if it has been deluted with water, or somthing. It has a stong perfummy smell, which I do not like, either. It feels like I am putting perfume on my face. It made my face burn a little, stopped using it. I am usally a big fan of loreal products, but this particular product did not desearve any stars!"
2,A so-so product,"I was looking for some real good moisturizer when I decided to buy this. The description and the reviews I read before buying it made me decide to try it, but unfortunately, it didn't work for me. Perhaps, it depends on the type of skin, as they say... I don't know. I used it a few times and now it is sitting there. I am not using it any more. For me, not worth buying.."
2,Disapointing Shoes,The shoes are to high in front top thus digging in to the front of your ankle an as such are very uncomfortable. I am trying to wear them hopeing they will stretch. They cost to much to adandon.
3,Sorry!,I am sorry to write that HALF of this DVD is of bad picture quality.It is like DELOS know that the names Radvanovsky/Hvorostovsky sells andthey think they can release anything - even bad quality. I couldn't believe my eyesand feel sorry for the hundreds of people who have already bought it.What a shame DELOS!!!
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"Talk about a major disappointment. Satoshi Tomiie is among the finest producers in House music today, and the announcement that he would release a full album generated a lot of anticipation in 1999. In the end, however, it ranks among the biggest let-downs in dance music.Why did Tomiie, a house producer, make such an undancable album. There is so little groove here. Most of the tracks are plodding.The only reason I give this disc two stars instead of one is because it contains ""Love in Traffic"" and ""Up in Flames,"" two of the hottest tracks ever produced for house. Featuring the sultry vocals of Kelli Ali, these two tracks could live on repeat.Nonetheless, they aren't enough of a reason to buy the album, when one can readily hear them at the club or in some DJ's set (John Digweed resurrected ""Love in Traffic"" fever by putting Satoshi's Dark Path remix on his latest LOS ANGELES retrospective).Wish it could have been better."
5,I Don't Get It...,"I don't understand the negative reviews for this recording. I think the rest of the disc not only lives up to the promise of ""Love in Traffic,"" but Tomiie ventures into new ground as well. There's the infectious ""Up in Flames"" with its ominous bassline and repetitive chorus, and the deep ""Darkness."" But Tomiie stretches beyond house and also gives us a touch of drum-and-bass and some jazzed up disco with soulful vocals. ""Full Lick"" shows that this DJ/remixer is no one-trick pony. He offers a variety of textures and grooves on this very good disc. Pay the naysayers no mind and get it."
4,decidedly delicious,"for those of you who feel the need to review the album negatively seeing that there are only a couple of songs on here that matter because of their commercial success, i have three words for you -> you are wrong! this album is great in that it covers all kinds of electronica genres, marking the true signs of a great electronicist such as satoshi tommiie. there is something on this album to please all tastes and moods. that is why ""full lick"" is a great listening piece."
4,The definitive New York house album?,"It's easy for me to define progressive tech-house as dominated by the likes of Sasha, Digweed and Peace Division, but across the Atlantic, things get a bit trickier for me, heh heh...I hope someone can correct me on the following. I believe Chicago house has disco influence, New York House has Latin inspirations (the styles of Tenaglia and Lawler) and Deep House (is there any other kind) comes from Washington D.C., led by Deep Dish. So where does Satoshi stands? Save for a couple of very out-of-place atmospheric tracks and the fact that this is not a mix album (which I would rather prefer), Full Lick is New York vocal house with a touch of class. I can't help feel that the better tracks like 'Up In Flames' and 'Inspired' sound so classy I just might subconsciously associate them as being 'New-Yorkish'...or maybe this is just Satoshi's style, or...as the review title goes: Is this the definitive New York house album?"
1,Very disappointed,"As a huge fan of the electronic scene, I expected this CD to be on the level of his hit 'love in traffic' which appears on numerous mix cds including john digweed's gu la. The first four tracks are great! Tracks 3 and 4 feature Kelli Ali (formerly of the Sneaker Pimps) so I was definitely looking forward to the rest of the CD. However, it is all down hill from there. Way too many vocals - really housey vocals - by a woman (not Kelli Ali) whose voice I find extremely annoying! And when you think she may actually not be in a track, she starts singing again. Just horrible, absolutely horrible. Anyway, I will never listen to a track after track 4 if I ever put the CD on again. I would barely even consider this CD electronic music! I would never recommend this CD to anyone! Buyers beware!"
5,Paradigm shifter,"This album, although never actually widely distributed, has changed many rock, jazz and new-school afficionado's music-listening careers for ever. Critters is a super band, a group of musicians who lead many other bands as well, making the music they want to make without industry pressures. Quite the defining album this is.-Dallabaster"
4,A Very Intriguing Clash of Styles,"Sort of a car wreck of styles, with hard bop, hippie jamming, rock and tape looping all getting into a major accident. But like many accidents, it's hard to look away. Very challenging stuff, and quite interesting, although I find that I definitely need to be ""in a mood"" to listen to it - not recommended for cocktail parties or relaxing at home. My favorite track is ""5/4 ftd"" (which sounds like a slightly large floral arrangement) but if you like the samples, you'll probably like the entire disc."
3,Hippie Jazz,"Take equal parts jazz improv and drum circle and you have Critters Buggin. Yet it's not hateful at all! Bouncy, fun, and occasionally spacy, ""Guest"" wears well on the stereo."
1,Required reading,This book was a required reading for my English Literature class. I found it very dull and boring. Wish it was not required.
2,there are better games out there,"though the graphics are stellar and place you in a 3d enviroment this game falls short on every other aspect even for fans of the series. after writing various companies asking them to develop a ozzy and drix game for the gba i didn't expect it to be quite like this. ozzy and drix doesn't boast a variety of moves only jump and shoot atcually. the game also combines driving, side scrolling action and a first person shooter mode but none of these are executed well and doesn't help the game's run and jump boring gameplay. the controls are also slightly slugglish and the 3d perspective can make it very hard to shoot enemies and even jump. Ozzy & Drix is an example of putting too many eggs in one basket. The 3D visuals are great, but every other aspect of the game comes up short. The level designs are boring; the controls are terrible; you can beat it in an hour and there is no replay value. the final verdict: don't buy this game!"
2,Unorganized song track and index listing.,"Im not sure where this seller obtained this CD or who put it together for them, but this is a very sloppy product. When I loaded the CD onto my computer several of the songs did not have the title listed but rather came up as Track 3, Track 7, etc. Also, the song index does not match the Track listings "" e.g. Track 5 may have its title as ABC but the index title is XYZ, and some Tracks are numbered as Track 23, 29, etc. "" there are no such Track numbers."
4,WHERE IS ROGER THE ENGINEER?,"Good overview of the group until 1966,but i don't know why they did not include tracks from their only studio classic:ROGER THE ENGINEER.Live tracks showcase ERIC CLAPTON's talent.You get the story alright with a missing spot;not an ordinary one because we are talking about a certain guy called JIMMY PAGE.EVIL HEARTED YOU remains my favorite YARDBIRD song;that guitar sound of the sixties wow!So, if you never heard the group,you should buy THE ULTIMATE(without COLLECTION),you will have the perfect anthology."
3,"A decent collection, but note this error in the track listing!!","The last track on disc 2 is NOT ""Stroll On"" as claimed on the package contents. The real ""Stroll On"" was recorded for the movie ""Blow Up"" and is a different version of ""Train 'Kept A Rollin'"" with revised lyrics. The track called ""Stroll On"" featured in this collection is actually a studio take of ""Good Morning Little Schoolgirl"" without vocals."
4,"The "" Ultimate Collection "" ?","This CD lacks the Yardbirds classic "" Over, Under, Sideways, Down "" which shows the Yardbirds at their best. Therefore, this is NOT the "" Ultimate Colletion "" but, it is a good collection."
3,Ultimately a disappointment,"The Yardbirds were a fine group of musicians but in my opinion, only the covers hold up well. Their own song writing is dated. But I bought this collection for one reason only and write this review for one reason only. I bought it for their rip-roaring version of I'm a Man and write this review to vent and to warn prospective buyers that the ultra-hard rockin' I'm a Man, the one that remains a staple on oldies stations, has been replaced by some lame version I'd never heard before. A pox on it!"
4,Good Book,"I read this book in 2011; quite a lot has changed since the book was written. Still, it's a refreshing book with an honest look at one woman's journey. It opens little glimps into the life of the people of Afghanistan."
4,Tools for everything,"This a really great, I use them all the time for home the car or my husband now takes them, they have a really comfortable grip and hardrened tips so they do not break."
1,What's wrong with this movie.,"Boring and I mean boring.The actors were fine but it is the story that stinks.Why didn't Stuart Townsend's and Charlize Theron's characters who had weapons each took out the bad guys and call the authorities immediately.And the helicopter chase scene didn't make any sense.Why didn't the FBI arrest Courtney Love's character earlier and when Kevin Bacon's character was hit in the face with a tire iron,how did he quickly recovered and was then shot to death.I saw so many flaws in the movie I could list them in a ten minute span."
1,MINDLESS TRASH,"I don't why reviewers need a 1,000 word essay to describe garbage. This ""movie"" smells from the start and keeps getting worse untill it ends"
4,The villans make the movie!,"It is easy to forget when watching a film that it is the villans, the bad guys who really make the film! James Bond wouldn't be any good unless his bad guys were incredibly bad, evil and wiley! Our heroes must overcome adversity! The tougher the bad guys, the more thrilling the film is and the more it holds our attention. As any actor learns...acting is not really acting...it's reacting! Our heroes react well to the charismatic evil supplied by Bacon. For thrills, producers must add a car chase or two, crash a plane, blow up a building here and there and roll over a few cars; for which our heroes barely escape with their lives. It's what we the mundane public crave, because we're not allowed to do it in our own lives. Bacon will always be a good Bad Guy, so thanks to him we can have somebody upon which to hope for his demise. Sometimes the Bad Guys are better than the Good Guys...but then we wouldn't want it any other way...would we??"
2,It wasn't worth the time,"This film starts out so smart -- it really raises expectations. And then it just devolves. By the end, I wanted the time back. Theron is a really good actress -- really the only thing that keeps the film from losing another star."
3,Trapped DVD,"The movie ""Trapped"" has a plot that has been played out a lot over the past decade. The theme is essentially a ransom demand for a kidnapped child who is played by Dakota Fanning. Ironically Fanning also played a kidnapped child in the Denzel Washington thriller ""Man on Fire"". The film makes up for a lack of creativity with a strong cast. The different locations of where everyone is out gets rotated on a regular basis, so whether it is the home Kevin Bacon's character is currently occupying, A cabin in the woods or a Hotel room, Trapped fills up time with good acting and some suspenseful moments. Courtney Love also stars in this film, although I had heard the name I did not know much about her. For someone with little acting experience she seemed to do a good job and she also seems to fit the bad girl role quite nicely."
3,Intriguing thriller with a crumbling finale!,"Kevin Bacon has starred many bleak stories. In this case he plays once more the ""bad guy"" role with interesting profiles. The original story in last instance cosntitutes a careful revenge due bad medical praxis.The central drama deals with an awful kidnapping and the eventual ransom will focuse around the special abilites of both parents.Charlize Theron at that moment and still yet is the most beautiful actress in the cinema, and his interpretative solvency is a true high peak.Possibly, the climax ending was extremely breathtaking and for many viwers the best part of the movie. Nevertheless, it is a good movie that gets its goal: to entertain us along two hours.Dakota Fanning is lovable; what talent!"
5,great,this is a ultra suspenseful and entertaining movie. i rented it over at my grandmas and even my grandma loved it. i've seen it twice since and it still never gets old.
2,Ugly.,"This is one of those movies, like 52 Pickup, that make you want to take a shower afterwards. Kevin Bacon is almost too good at this!Without giving away the almost 100% cliche plot would someone explain why Kevin is seeking revenge against this couple--yet they are his fourth set of victims, not the first? Did he ring the wrong doorbell the first 3 times?"
2,"ok plot, but a little far fetched","if you saw kevin bacon in the river wild, reality would set in. kevin and his assailance would kidnap meryl streeps son out in no mans land river fronts and would get away with it. that to me is reality. However, trapped kidnapping way out of its league; cmon, do you think these kidnappers would really show their appearance to the family. the fbi would have a most wanted list. Also, the kidnapping happened way too quick; they come in the house out of the blue and kidnapp the daughter. besides bacon, the acting was so ans so. overall, could of been better."
4,Yes it's Charlize and Dakota.,"Dakota Fanning's earlier movie. She's a great actress very talented little girl. Movie is pretty good and Courtney Love, Eh not bad."
1,make it stop please!!,"Starts well, then turns into a over contrived mixed up movie with unplausible situations. A train wreck of a movie that keeps hurtling along, do yourself a favor and pass on this stinker."
3,"Barely deserves 3 stars, but ultimately dishes out enough entertainment.","Decent acting, coupled with a stronger first half of movie, which later begins to crumble with a chopped-up, non-believable plot, ultimately dishes out just enough entertainment to be worthy of a watch.Horrible director decisions with how to take this story as the movie travels on, to where near the final 30 minutes is basically a joke. Couple that with again, an overall horrible decision to have it that the Dr. and wife BOTH decide to try to fight back to some degree, basically increasing the chances of their own daughter getting murdered was/is simply a total failure on behalf of the director.But, again, some semi-strong performances by the lead actors, along with an already biased stance on Kevin Bacon (who i actually like) barely squeezes out this 3 star rating.Definitely not on the level of a ""Ransom"", with Mel Gibson, in any capacity, however."
2,"Stupid revenge flick, fake suspense",I'm afraid this one lost me on the premise that an airplane with the engine off dives at several thousand feet per minute.
3,It was Ok,"What can I say. We watched it and it was OK. I thought it started off good. Had some good twists early on, but then it just didn't interest me toward the end."
1,not good,I love kevin bacon and i thought this movie would be great. I read the book 24 hours by greg isles associated with this movie and the book was awesome so i had high expectations. I know people always say the book is always better but even if i hadnt read the book this movie was terrible. not worth the money
2,unbelievable,this movie took 2 weeks from my ship date to arrive...........i contacted seller twice.. wouldn't buy anything else from them
2,"LUIS MANDOKI, OPUS 8","** 2002. Based on Greg Iles's24 Hoursand directed by Luis Mandoki. Kevin Bacon's family kidnaps the daughter of the Jennings. Very bad movie of the Mexican director who'll give us, two years later, the masterpieceInnocent Voicesthough. I wonder whether Luis Mandoki could do better with the material he had to work with. We never feel that the Jennings family is really in danger and the final scene on the highway is rather ridiculous, the extras gently walking between the cars while there are a shootout and a plane/truck collision in front of them. Shame. Already forgotten."
2,watch on cable,This is still entertaining despite its predictability. A family of three are held hostage in three separate places under the gun of three different criminals. See it for the performances.
3,"Good, But Needs More Work.","Ordered this item along with some other Gator cases to carry drums and other assorted percussion ware.The bag holds a lot of hardware and has ample space. The one, but significant, flaw is the positioning of thewheels. When the bag is somewhat loaded the wheels don't provide full clearance for the tilt and therefore you'redoing more dragging than rolling which defeats the purpose of the wheels. Tried adjusting the angle of the lift, but that wasn't happening. The positioning of the wheels in relation to the angle of lift is the only negative I found with this bag."
4,Car travel,Perfect for the price. Lots of our travel is in our car and this is all we need to cover shirts and light jackets
4,travel bag-duit,"Basic light weight travel bag for suits, shirts, or pants. Not big enough for long dresses. Very good for the cost, but not a heavy duty bag."
4,travel bag,"The travel bag is a good quality product. All we needed was something to carry dress shirts and skirts in while on business trips keeping them covered. We didn't need the large bag with wheels, etc. Perfect."
1,Junk. Lasted one day,This garment bag was junk.The zipper lasted ONE day.Not too convenient when it broke the first time I used it and was leaving town the next day.Do not buy this product.
1,"Awful, awful, awful","I'm not sure where all the great reviews came from, but this bag was poorly made and the material is paper thin. All I can say is this...I didn't expect much at a $10 price point and this bag still managed to disappoint me. Spend the extra $5-10 and get something that will last."
3,Good to have,This is very handy to have and its very easy to clean and to have around & easy to manage
3,Not that great,"As the other reviewers have commented, it is NOT a travel bag. I look at it as a bigger extended coat bag. It is the same quality like the coat covers that one gets when buying a suit/coat. Just that it is wider and holds three coats. However this works since I needed something to fit my three coats inside for travel. Could be better for the price. Also, I havent yet figured out how to use the handle function. It apparently turns into a handle. Just ok."
2,"Too Thin - OK for Home/Car Storage of Suits, Not for Trips/Planes.","This is a plastic bag container for your suit.** Home/Car storage of your suit? Go for it. If you buy it to store your suit at home or in your car, etc. go for it.** Travelling on plane? No! If you are buying it for travelling your suit with you on planes, etc. I think you better go with something sturdier which will much better keep your suit safe, and less wrinkled. Even carrying the suit with this is a bit hard, since it bends on the ends easily.Cheap in price, cheap in material. Suits are not that cheap, go for something that can protect your suits better..."
4,Does it's job,It does it's job. Nothing fancy or heavy duty. It's light and covers my suit well. Can fit mulitple items in one bag.
1,"The right size, but shoddy manufacture","This bag would be just what I needed, except that the stitching around the zipper has completely unraveled after less than 2 months' use, rendering the product worthless."
5,Good bag for my use,I use this to keep my uniforms together at work...is great for what I wanted it for...
5,Delivery and product,I received the product before the estimated delivery date. I ordered 5 travel suit bags but I haven't used the bags yet but from looking them over they look like they will work great. I was looking for this type of bag so that when I go on vacation I can separate each days clothing so that all I have to take into the motel is what I will wear the next day. No more lugging a huge suitcase in and out of the motels every day. YAY!!!
3,"double play, no home run",wide enough for a couple/few suits. WEIRD WEIRD strap/loop/ring arrangement. annoying corners on bottom when folded and carried. i'll make use of it after i figure out how to deal with the strap.
2,"Functional, but lacks comforts","This is not bad for the price, but is lacking many niceties. I use this to carry my uniform in to work, pants and blouse. The bag is large enough to hold my uniform without crumpling. That is about where the function ends. I would have liked to have actual handles attached to top and bottom so that when folded for carrying the handles came together. Also, it would have been nice to have a means to keep the four corners, when in folded carrying mode, together-snaps would be fine. This would have made it look nicer and less of a mess when carrying.For the price, I can't complain, this doesn't seem to be an item many people need, or Amazon just doesn't carry many types."
3,Travel Bag Acceptable but Could be Better,"This lightweight garment bag is of decent quality. The side entry takes some getting used to, but the worst feature is the lack of a way to secure your hangers. There is a strap to keep bag secure if folded, but you can't really use this to secure the hangers as well. Worth the money but the design could use some improvement."
5,PERFECT TRAVEL BAG FOR SUITS,"These well-made bags can easily hold three suits. This is my second order and I am using some for suit storage. I highly recommend them, a great value for the price."
4,A little long,"Used it right away not just for travel but also for keeping suits and other expensive outfits protected, it's a little long though not a major complaint as it allows for other garments as well"
5,Awesome,This worked very well for me! Very good price and it folds up well and kept my suit lookin good!
5,Good product,As indicated in my previous review - great product.Keeps the suits clean and uncrushed.Good item to recommend and for a gift.
4,"Basic, functional garment bag","This is the type of garment bag you are typically given when purchasing a suit at a high end store. It would not be suitable for checking in on a plane as it is not luggage quality but it is a great way to safely store your clothing in the closet and to quickly grab it, look at the tag, and stick it in an actual piece of luggage when traveling. Looks nice, holds a few hangers worth of clothes inside and is easy to open. I have no idea how to operate this weird strap but don't believe it will be needed anyway. I have three and I will buy more as my suit collection expands."
2,Disappointed,"Bought this based on the good reviews. Not worth the $. It is pretty flimsy. Not sure how long it will last. Better to add a few bucks and buy something better. The only good thing about it is the width (5"" deep)."
1,poor purchase,"This garment bag arrived with ample evidence of poor construction. The entire zipper strip detached from the bag the very first time that I tested the zipper. Hope that this information helps you to avoid this ""waste of money""."
4,Zipper,The garment bag should have been made with the zipper in the middle and not on the side. It gets cumbersome to put the hangers in the garment bag one hanger at a time.
4,Surprisingly Good...,I was a bit skeptical since this item was so cheap but when I got it I found it very well constructed and it didn't have that 'chemical' smell. It is wide enough to hold a suit or two and a few shirts. I look forward to using it it my travels or for storage in the closet.
5,Great Travel Bag-Awesome Bargain!,My husband travels out of town a lot for business and this bag is perfect for his jackets and suits.
4,I think for the price it's a good deal.,"I purchased these for rabbit hunting. When I pulled them out of the shipping box I was a tad skeptical. The grips and blades are more substantial than standard scissors, but would they cut through rabbit bone? Well, I went out and got a few rabbits last weekend and they cut through the legs, pelvis and neck with little effort. I think they will work just fine for rabbits as well as the bird hunting I plan to start doing. Also, as a plus, since the blades can be taken apart, cleaning is a snap."
1,Do not buy these poor quality shears,I bought these to do serious cutting. Never even got the chance because the tore up before I could cut anything substantial. These shears were difficult to align and the handle broke off on something kitchen scissors could cut. An absolute peice of trash.
4,Me too,"This thoughtful, direct book wends its way around the coasts of all the prime surf spots. It harks back to the early days when surfing was a way of living. Its anecdotal style answers some of the who what and where's of surfing greats. The style is pure ""by the campfire"" , like one surfer telling another about the greatest wave ever or how some scrawny kid turned into a ""Meta"" surfer, defying all known physical laws in the tube of a wave. You don't need to be an insider to dig this book, it is a happy flow of the renaissance of surfing."
1,Bad Hinges,"If you open the tops a little too much they become unhinged and are very very difficult to get back into the slots. Other then the horrible hinges it did protect my plants. Because of the difficulty in trying to get the tops on , I gave it away. I would not recommend this product."
3,"Very Large switch, clicks loudly","Not what I was hoping for, but works well. Just very large and uncanny, and clicks loudly when switching. but fits right into the matrix 2003 dash clip area."
5,SUPERB MOVIE,Everything about this movie was GREAT!! Good plot ~ makes you think through out whole story! Similarily like The Sixth Sense with its - bits of hints. Watching twice as I did helps to pick up on it & absorb it all better...
4,the point is,"the point is not the writers understanding of mental illness-it is actually his/her understanding of the god complex some doctors succumb to. the dr is ironically battling his own emotional demons and while purportedly thoroughly understanding and trying to ""treat"" the societally recognized mental patients-failing miserably. i think it is a well thought out script, about people who think they have all of the answers trying to impress their ideas upon society while not having a freaking insite to their own failings and shortcomings resulting in them looking like complete idiots; you cannot make someone else whole if you are fragmented yourself -you need to have your own affairs in order before you start trying to ""help"" someone else achieve mental bliss and do not assume you have any idea what someone elses hell maybe or how they should deal with it because you have a piece of paper stating you are a dr.excellent movie!"
5,an unfortunatly unknown classic,"this had to be one of the strangest films i've ever seen. but at the same time one of the best. Ty Adams is a unconventional therapist whose unusual methods lead him to be followed by a documentary crew (lead by John C. McGinley) for 30 days at Sedah(hades spelled backwards). while there a patient enters the hospital claiming to be Satan. so begins Ty's downward spiral into insanity as he is unsure whether this man truly is the devil, or he himself is insane. the ending is spectacular. i highly recommend it to anyone."
5,Crazy indeed,Really good movie. Disturbing in some parts but it's still really good. It's one of those movies where you will debate the reasons why certain this happened.
2,Only for fans of the show!,"What an unfortunate purchase! I have never seen this show, and perhaps that is why I cannot fathom the high ratings for this Christmas album. It is so poor, almost like a computer program created the music. It is upbeat but uninspiring, very much like the music and singing at a Disney street parade. I am so sad I bought this based on these good reviews, since Amazon reviews usually help me avoid poor purchases like this one. If you don't know these characters and this show, please listen carefully to the samples before you buy. I can't imagine anyone who doesn't watch the show liking this. So many better Christmas albums for children out there... such as Beary Christmoose, Raffi's Christmas album, and the Chipmunk's Christmas CD, just for starters. My children and I even like ""Yo, It's Christmas!"" a children's hip hop holiday album, better than this. Do yourself a favor: definitely don't buy this until you've listened to all the samples. Wish I had!"
5,It's a Hi-5 Christmas,I purchased the Jump and Jive CD from Hi-5 and say the christmas CD on sale. I had heard and seen a video of on of the christmas songs and thought my son may enjoy this one too. And sure enough he loves the Christmas CD as much as the orginal one. He still love to listen to it even though Christmas is over. I like how they kept some Christmas songs in there orignal/traditional way. But they also changed a few songs but named them as some of the more traditional ones. All in all it is a beautiful Christmas CD and I feel they are very talented singers. I think any one looking to purchase a nice Christmas CD for their child should purchase this one. You won't be disapointed.
5,Super debut Record By Ms. Summers,"I didn't expect such good album from an unknown artist. The very first time I heard ""Transplanting"" I was hook. Elaine has such a great style and made such a good work on this record that I would give it the highest score a new comer could possibly get. She combines the classic 60's rock with the glam rock of the 90's. I like her album so much I bet you would too."
5,Best deal around.,"I have issued my own private Album of the Year awards all the way from to 1954 (Kid Ory's ""1954."") My list includes artists as diverse as the Rolling Stones, Miles Davis, U2, Norah Jones, David Grisman and Paul Brady, as famous as Elvis Presley or the Beatles and as obscure as Fraser and DeBolt or Poor Man's Whiskey. Or Elaine Summers. For my money, ""Transplanting"" was the very best release of 1997."
5,A Beautiful Remembrance of Engelbert's 2006 Tour,"I saw Engelbert's show on April 3, 2006 in Green Bay, Wi. It was ""Amazing."" It was so good, that I was saddened that after all of these years this is the first time I got to be at one of his concerts. I have both the CD and the DVD, and they are so much like the show. Beautiful music and a beautiful voice! I just hope Engelbert keeps touring so we can keep enjoying his shows - an appreciation of the finer things in life. I recommend the CD and DVD to anyone, in fact all of his DVD's are a treasure and a must-have."
5,TOTALLY AMAZING,"This CD is TOTALLY AMAZING. When I listen to it I feel like I'm in the audience. I LOVE IT WHEN HE DOES LIVE CD'S. I LOVE HIM, PERIOD!!!YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL."
5,"Engelbert ""Totally Amazing"" DVD","I second the Wow, Wow, and Wow again of the previous review as I received my DVD today. I give this DVD a 5 stars plus. I got the CD two days ago and have been enjoying it tremendously, but that was just the beginning as the DVD is absolutely incredible. What a fantastic concert recording. Engelbert's voice has certainly improved with age and how wonderful to have the pleasure of enjoying his singing for he is ""Totally Amazing""."
3,Pretty Good,"It's a decent DVD, although I was a bit disspointed that plenty of his songs/performances are from later in his career. I prefer watching and hearing his original recordings/performances that show him in his prime. I would recommend an alternate DVD: Engelbert Humperdinck: 1967-1977."
4,Engelbert Humperdinck - Totally Amazing,"at last a dvd worthwhile buying and listening to from engelbert. good dts audio and an appropriate title that fits in with the songs selection. engelbert has not lost any of his stage personality and performance - in fact it appears to get better and more matured with him age-ing. if you have any cd's or dvd's from engelbert already, then it is worhwhile adding this dvd to your colletion. thx. andré"
4,fairly good,This cd fairly good but not one of the best. I think it needed some more of crazier load of tunes because it starts of really good and later on the tunes are not as dramatic. But its a good cd
3,"Not bad, but I preferred the U.K. version","I was looking for the U.K version instead... a little disappointed as the U.S. version is not as good, in my opinion. Should have checked more thoroughly. Anyways, does anybody know where to get the U.K. version?"
4,Really good book if you are looking for plans for Folk Toys,"This is a good book if you are interested in American Folk toys. Includes such items as climbing bears, Ball and Cup games, Do-nothing machines. and some doll furniture."
3,Pretty Good,Most Of The Material here is Not On Par with Her Best.United Together is the closes she comes to her Golden Era.What a Fool Believes sounds Pretty Good.Together Again is a Good cut.but other wise it's not one of her strongest.
4,Aretha's First Arista Release Showed Pleasures to Come,"After a long and musically satisfying career with Atlantic, Aretha severed her ties with that company and moved under the wing of Arista's Clive Davis. With the start of the 1980's, Aretha was looking for new territory to conquer and almost succeeded with this mixed bag.""United Together"" is a fine tune that benefits from beautiful orchestral arrangement that is matched by Aretha's superb vocal instrument. The remake of ""Can't Turn You Loose"" allows Aretha to show why she is the Queen of Soul"" for she really belts this one out. Another cover, that of the Doobies' ""What a Fool Believes,"" is an interesting interpretation. The final cut ""School Days"" appears to be ""autobiographical"" for every girl growing up in the fifties.Although not as strong as her Atlantic work, ""Aretha"" is still a suitable addition to the artist's discography."
4,excellent singable country,"This is a great album. I can't understand why ""If it wearn't for Country Music....."" only got to #17 when it was realesed.The whole album is filled with music that's catchy and has that fantastic country beat that all country fans just love straight away. The only reason I didn't give it the 5 stars is because NOTHING gets full marks.If you like tradtional country music you NEED this album"
5,Superb,"This is one of the loveliest, most moving vocal albums you will ever hear. Recorded not long before Irene Kral's death (at an early age of breast cancer), this album may be the most gorgeous product of her career. It's a 1977 recording with accompaniment by Alan Broadbent. This is the same team that gave us the glorious album Where Is Love. Don't miss this."
3,Perfect voice but harsh recording.,"As always, Irene Kral's singing is impeccable. Her voice is enhancedby having only the piano accompanying her.But the recording is flawed by poor engineering which produces a harsh sound. But its worth it to here her voice. Absent in previous reviews of herwork is the fact that she gives new meaning to the words ""perfectpitch."""
1,waste of time and money,"this wasn't even a good/bad movie. this has the look and feel of high school students who found a camera and decided to make a movie. one star is to generous. worst production values i've ever scene. poor lighting. the acting and script was horrible. i assume they were going for tongue and cheek, and completely missed the boat. this wasn't even low budget movie. this was no budget movie. for those of who enjoy vampire genre movies this is a must miss. the only thing you will be doing if you watch this is seeing how well your fast forward button works on your dvd player."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the DVD. I don't like seeing just small clips of matches. I like to see what leads up to the greatest moments not just bits and pieces. Had I seen this DVD first, I never would have bought it. Definitely not TNA quality!"
2,I can't believe what they call great moments!,"This wasn't a total waste of money, but close. Sting coming to TNA near the top of the list...get real. Jarrett hitting Hogan in Japan...who cares. This is a ""love me"" DVD (why am I surprised?)If you're looking for some interesting footage, I'm not seeing any. Pretty much stuff you've already seen. They should not charge for this. P.S. I am a big TNA fan, and have most of their DVDs."
3,WCW Lives!,"TNA is a great company for fans who long for the era of WCW VS WWE. Too bad TNA is turning out to be WCW circa 2000. Its a funny trend to have big names come in and win the belt within a few months: Christian Cage, Sting, and now Kurt Angle. Do you sign a deal with TNA and automatically get the world title? RVD is soon to join the ranks of TNA. I do think its a good move. RVD vs AJ Styles? Sting? Samoa Joe? The Fallen Angel? Senshi? The matches are endless if they choose to play there cards right. WWE is in a rut and people are getting sick of the company. TNA should take over as the #1 company but has yet to do it. Everyone claims to hate ECW but it gets the same ratings as TNA on Thrusday. TNA should grow more talent like Styles, Samoa Joe, and Fallen Angel instead of stars like Tomoko, Basham, The Steiners, Dudleys, Road Warrior Animal, Angle, Sting, etc."
1,"""Stacy's Mom"" is a crappy song","Ok, this band is way overrated. I can't believe so many people like the song ""Stacey's Mom"". To me, it's a really irritating song. One time, my friend was singing this song when I was at his house. It's bad enough when he sings a good song, since he sucks at singing, but him singing Stacy's Mom is my version of hell. He's actually a stoner, so I guess some of the pot residue in his system made him like Stacy's Mom so much. Maybe the members of FOW are stoners too. I'd have to be pretty stoned to come up with a song as stupid as Stacey's Mom. It's not just FOW that sucks, I hate pop music in general. If this review didn't help you, then you can cry me a river so you can drown in it."
1,Back to boy bands,Lots of people I knew were talking about the song Stacy's mom. Arghhhh. When I heard Stacy's mom I thought I would be sick. It sounds just like those crappy N'sync and Backsreet Boys songs that so popular before. I really hope that music isn't going in that direction again.
2,Unremarkable,"Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't nerd pop die with Weezer in the mid nineties? This is pretty light rock/pop that has plenty of your catchy hooks and verse/chorus four minute pop standards but it's all just so predictable.You can almost visualise them in the studio putting the ticks in the box. Nice guitar strumming intro - tick, nice rhyming four line verse - tick, now let's build it up for the chorus repeat four times - tick. Finish. Next song and so on.An album of quite unremarkable quality really."
4,Power pop satisfaction guaranteed...,"I'll keep this short and to the point. If you like late 70's, early 80's power pop (i.e., Cheap Trick, The Knack, The Cars), then this album is for you! The entire album is pure ear candy at best! Hummable melodies, catchy pop chords, and melodic guitars are what make this album so infectious to listen to! Most of all, it's positive and upbeat!"
5,Can't help but like it,"I'm usually into harder stuff than this, but found myself unable to resist giving in to the impossibly catchy CD. For my money Mexican Wine is by far the best song on the album."
4,One of the best of the year,This is a good throwback album to the days of good powerpop (Cars)etc. I t has one of the best opening three songsthat you are likely to find on any other record. It also has acouple of songs which sound like they could have beenwritten by the beach boys or Simon and Garfunkel. Beforeyou buy a [bad] album like the new limp bizkit or nickelbackCD pick this up.
4,The Power of Video,"I saw these guys on MTV2 singing ""Stacey's Mom"" and loved the catchy tune. So I bought the whole CD. The CD is excellent pop/rock."
3,Ok,"This is an ok CD. The best ones are Stacey's Mom, but that's way over played, and Mexican Wine. I just don't like alot of the songs on hear but none of them are paticularly bad. It's worth geting if you want a change in sound for a little while but honestly if you don't buy Cds for 1 or 2 songs it's not worth the money.*~cambell~*"
1,Complete [garbage],"This cd is the biggest piece of [garbage] in rock ,pop history since presidents of the united states of america. I would take this cd if it was given to me . I mean the first single they release is the worst song on cd ; Stacy's mom. Which has no substance or anything to make the song bearable to listen to more than a few times. If this is supposed to be the rebirth of rock & roll then i dont want any part of it."
2,Im not a big fan,I bought this CD thinking hey stacys mom is a fun song why not? i think that the cd is very boring. i think alot about the lyrics of the songs and the lyrics to me dont mean anything. They just ryme.
1,NO MORE STACY'S MOM DAMNIT!,"Ok, after being baraged by that song a million times a day for about a month I have a deep loathing and resentment towards Fountains of Wayne. When I first heard the song I knew imediently that these guys had ""ONE HIT WONDER BAND!"" writen all over them, and since Stacy's Mom we have heard no more of this annoying pop band (thankfully), but seriously, please don't buy this cd, this band and their songs are dissposable, crappy, and above all stupid."
2,two songs,"I gave this two stars for two songs:stacy's mom and mexican wine. I'm not just saying that because they're the hits, they're also the only good songs on this album. I tried to listen through the whole thing but skipped every one because they all started out boring."
5,Incredible,"I've been a FoW fan from the beginning, and they have NEVER disappointed me. I've been listening to this CD for years, and I still sometimes just sit and listen to it. The harmonies in ""Valley Winter Song"" almost made me fall off my chair the first time I heard the song. I think ""Mexican Wine"" might be a better radio pop song than Stacy's Mom, but Stacy's Mom rode the strength of a funny and relatable concept combined with a sexy and funny video. I still think ""Hailey's Waitress"" isn't a great song, but its OK. My biggest disappointment with this CD is that ""Yours and Mine"" is only a minute long!! But maybe the song's greatness lies in the fact that it leaves us wanting more and more of the same song, and we also just don't want the CD to be over."
5,Oasis meets Simon and Garfunkel,"What I look forward to hearing every time I pick up a new supposed pop cd is anything even nearly as good as Welcome Interstate Managers. Unbelievably melodic, catchy pop tunes, even veering off into country with ""Hung Up On You."" The songs here are about nothing much, the red light on the telephone, Hackensack, a sales meeting in Baltimore, falling in love with your girlfriend's mother, and some of the oddest lyrics you're likely to hear (""Riding around in a Volkswagen van, Thinking 'bout the people upside-down in Japan""), but somehow Fountains of Wayne pulls it off. ""Little Red Light"" and especially ""Supercollider"" could be Oasis -- and the influence of Simon and Garfunkel is evident on ""No Better Place"" (cf. S&G's ""The Only Living Boy In New York""), ""Valley Winter Song,"" and ""Halley's Waitress."" Perfect pop, the best of 2003, the best cuts here are ""All Kinds of Time,"" ""No Better Place,"" ""Supercollider,"" ""Bright Future in Sales,"" ""Little Red Light."""
3,Glad I won this in a radio contest instead of buying it.,"So I won this in a radio contest years ago and I'm just now listen to tracks beyond Stacys Mom. The only other track on this cd I like is ""Mexican Wine"". I can't connect to any of the other songs and the cd isn't that great. I have to admit though that the beats on the songs are catchy, just the lyrics suck."
3,Pretty hit and miss,"While this record does possess some amazingly catchy pop hooks reminiscent of everything from early Cars to mid-era Beach Boys to early Weezer, it's mainly made up overly contemporary, predictable tracks reminiscent of John Cougar Mellencamp.Not a horrible purchase, but not something that's going to be stuck in my CD player for three weeks either. Regarding the review that referenced the latest New Pornographers release -- yes! Consider purchasing that instead! :-)"
2,Not their best CD,"To all you new FOW fans, this is by far not their best effort. Although I am pleased that they have finally notoriety, I am a little disappointed it happended with this CD. Although some of the songs are still catchy (Stacey's Mom, Mexican Wine, Winter...), they lack some of the spontenaity that their past songs have. The songs within this CD almost feel forced for attention. Some of the songs are downright bad in my opinion. In addition, it seems strange for almost middle aged men to be singing about high school and teen topics. I hope FOW's next CD does not fall within these parameters again."
4,Debt owed to the Cretones,"Forget homage to the Monkees or the Beatles (how pedestrian other reviewers are)! The real ancestoral hertitage of this CD and this band is the late-70s/early-80s L.A. band called The Cretones. Listen -- if you can find it -- to Mark Goldenberg's vocal and lyrics on ""Swinging Divorcee'"" and you'll understand where both the music and the words for ""Stacy's Mom"" come from."
5,"More than just ""Stacey's Mom""","Of course everyone loves that single, myself included, but the album has other really good songs that will get inside your head after a few listens. Great tunes with sometimes hilarious lyrics. Highly recommended!"
4,"This is REAL pop, Power Pop","Being a fan of REAL Pop, Power Pop, since the mid 70's I welcome the FOW cd ""Welcome Interstate Managers!""I have enjoyed Power Pop from The Box Tops, The Rasberrys and Rundgren Through XTC The Ramones (yes, The Ramones) and Matthew Sweet right up to these guys, Foutains of Wayne.I first heard of FOW when a Christmas ep showed up at my classical music radio station in 1996! (I'm the MD of an NPR affiliated classical music station.) The wit of the lyrics and massive guitar hooks won me over the very first time I listened!I went right out and purchased their first self titled cd. Utopia Parkway followed and now Welcome Interstate Managers.All the music on cd from FOW is quality Power Pop. Don't wait, the sooner you get this record the sooner you too will discover what I have known for almost six years, these guys are a knock out!"
5,Power Pop Delight,"I got this cd after reading a review and it is one of the few cds this year to live up to the hype. My favorite song on this album is ""All Kinds of Time,"" a song about a quarterback which is perfectly written and performed. ""Valley Winter Song,"" ""No Better Place,"" and ""Hackensack"" are also great songs. ""Stacy's Mom"" is the obvious single release, but the others are the ones that I think show the talent of this band at it's best. Their music has an 80s feel to it and reminds me of Crowded House in a way. Here is the tracklisting since Amazon doesn't list it for some reason...1. Mexican Wine2. Bright Future In Sales3. Stacy's Mom4. Hackensack5. No Better Place6. Valley Winter Song7. All Kinds of Time (what a song!8. Little Red Light9. Hey Julie10. Halley's Waitress11. Hung Up On You12. Fire Island13. Peace And Love14. Bought For A Song15. Supercollider16. Yours And Mine"
5,"""He was killed in a cellular phone explosion""","When I heard these words, the first of the first song, I was completely hooked.It's a great album, full of 1960's-sounding music, but with themes from the 1990's and 2000's. Every song's a winner, with lyrics that stick in your mind."
3,Pretty good...,"This album is okay. I suspect that it prob'ly appeals more to the male persuasion, esp. those reliving (or still living!) their adolescence - ""Stacy's Mom"" is a perfect example! I'm gettin' a bit of weary of this tune with all the airplay of late. I do like ""Hey Julie,"" and all the tunes are catchy. My 12-year-old son likes it a lot, natch!"
2,what the hell happened to wayne?,"ok what i first started hearing stacy's mom and i thought ""hey this is pretty good i'll definatly have to pick up their new disk"".so i did.what follwed was one of the biggest let downs i've had in the my time listening to music. sure their are a few good songs like ""hey julie"" and ""hackensack"" and ""mexican wine"" (those three songs are what is getitng my rating) but the rest of it is crap.stacy's mom started off solid but i heard i ALL the time on the radio and then everyone started singing it.the rest is just bad.what ever happened to the good ol fountians of wayne that made such great songs as ""leave the biker"" ""survival car"" ""sink ott he bottom"" ""red dragon tatto"" and ""denise"". i want my old non-commercial pop fountains of wayne back..."
1,Not worth it,"If you like this kind of music then there are much better albums for you to use your money on. I don't know, but I just didn't like the feel of this cd and it's music. I honestly don't know, I didn't connect to any of their music at all. I honestly think people have overrated this album thanks to the success of the song Stacy's Mom. It was a good song, but that doesn't work as an excuse for this cd. Sorry."
5,The last great American pop band,"With there last album ,"" Utopia Parkway"" , this band showed us how much they loved the Beach Boys, the Raspberries, and the '70's concept album.Now ,with ""Welcome Interstate Managers"" ,they dip their magical fingers into late '70's / early '80's pop.But with their sharp humor intact, it isn't the vapid American pop of that era they so masterfully perform, it's the great British pop they do more than pay homage to. Yes, there is the hint of the Cars or punk in these songs, but listen to the vocals and you hear the Finn brothers or Squeeze. With current pop being mostly prepackaged drek or overly pompous psuedo important opuses, hearing an ""album"" of great songs is more than refreshing, it is actually hopeful for the future of popular music that incredibly original songwriting can prevail."
4,A CD you can listen to (almost) straight through,"I love it when I get a new CD, and am able to listen to it straight through without the urge to skip songs. However, I have found this to be pretty rare, as I usually have to let songs grow on me before I like them.With the exception of one song (""Hung Up on You"", not a country fan, sorry), I listened to this CD three times in a row without skipping any songs. Particular current faves include ""Valley Winter Song"" and ""Hey Julie"".Any Fountains of Wayne fans should like this CD."
5,perfection?,"in the recent history of the achievement of aural perfection on a rock record, this, ladies and gentlemen, is fountains of wayne's _car wheels on a gravel road_, a collection of tunes so clean and shiney they all simply scream ""absolutely perfect modern pop music!"" ""stacy's mom"" is wonderful, but is just the tip of the iceberg. this record's only flaw are the last four songs (tracks 13-16), which would have fit much more comfortably as b-sides for the first couple singles."
5,Old School meets New,"FOW has a very unique sound and overall captivating aura. This old schooler who likes new bands with talent and flair gives the CD a 4.5. Just about every song kicks, especially the pop Cars-style hit ""Stacy's Mom."" What the hell, push it to a 5 based on the Stacy's Mom video...best video since Van Halen's ""Hot For Teacher."""
3,Nice album but...,"Got one of these because I'm a huge fan of Bloodhound Gang. If you already have ""use your fingers"" there's not much here for you. There is some different random tracks (like cheese tidbits) and the similarly named tracks are different cuts with slight different music/lyrics/bg noise.Cool album but really only for the hard core, Unless your a diehard fan, I'd suggest starting with the more readily available and less expensive ""use your fingers"" which also has more tracks and some great exclusive songs on it."
4,Great for what it is.,"This was one of the first books I ever read and have been looking for another copy for years. It's not the most detailed or thorough book in the world, but if you follow it, then you'll be shooting over a beautifully-trained dog in no time. Simplicity is the basis of this book."
1,It takes an Act of Patience to read this book,"Have you ever had a dream where you are trying to walk thru ankle- deep mud, water, sand (pick one) in heavy boots, and each step is almost impossible?? That's what I started to experience about a third of the way thru this book. The main charactors, Luke and Jessica, talk, talk, talk, deep serious conversations that go on and on, and if they are not doing that, they dissect everything-- acting, directing, etc. On and on. I started skipping pages, and when I started reading again, they would still be talking about the same thing. I started skipping more and more, and finally I just didn't care anymore. These charactors are the most self absorbed, dull people I have ever encountered. Even the grandmother who had passed away was long-winded in her letters. A lot of the book is written in the form of letters, and boy, are they boring."
1,A very slow read!,"I'm reading this book now, and I'm not sure I'm going to make it all the way through. The plot is obvious, and the ending will be no surprise. Also, the sentences just go on and on, sometimes taking up half a paragraph, for one sentence. For me, this book is a very, very slow read. I personally wouldn't recommend it."
1,What a bummer,"Having just finished with a tough year of school I was looking forward to wrapping myself up in a great book that made the hours fly by in the most pleasant way. With so much dribble out there I was having a tough time until I spy'd Judith Michael's book on the shelf. ""Yes! Goal achieved!"" All I have to say now that I've read the book is I will just keep looking. This book is slow and while the characters are interesting they have so little to do you quit caring about them. I think any two people in real life would have more interest to me. My suggestion is DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Reread some better and older books from the same author. And pray the next book is much better so I won't have to keep looking for a good book - and neither will you."
1,ZZZzzzzzzz,"Argh ... must type quickly. Before strength fails. ... Book so dull ... saps all energy. Much like kryptonite. Beware. Seriously, this book is sooooo dull! The plot moves along like a cement truck up a ski slope. Don't waste your time."
5,Timeless minimalism with a sweet heart,"I bought this album on vinyl in a second hand store not long after it was first released. Guess someone didn't like it. A few years later I sold my records to travel, and yet the dancing baselines and sweet ethereal vocals still lift me from time to time. No music I have ever heard has quite struck this blend of muscles and fragility. One song, ""Salad Days"", has just two lines of vocal. It is a bassist's record, made jagged by angled six-string chords, sweetened by Alison Statton's extraordinary voice. I still don't know what half the songs are meant to be about, but ""Wurlitzer Jukebox"" will be the song (I hope) that is playing in my head when I die. A sad, lost, secret classic. From Tracey Thorn to Portishead, Radiohead to - even - Natalie Merchant, there are debts owed here even if they never know it."
3,Five out of six Dot-Its worked.,"I appreciated the fact that the lights arrived in a very timely fashion. I used them as Christmas ""stocking stuffers."" However, one of the lights did not work properly. It was a dud. I would really appreciate being sent another that works to replace the faulty one."
2,Great at first then not so wonderful,"When I got this to put in the closet, I was very pleased: the light was bright, easy to use and it was easy to stick to the wall.However, the brightness does not last! You have to change the batteries every couple of months, even if using alkalines, to get a bright light. The color of the LEDs is a little off, too.So I could only recommend this as an emergency light or somewhere where you won't use it very often.And under no circumstances forget to turn it out and leave it burning overnight!"
4,It wasnt that bad,Ok so mabey some of the songs could be better like the nookie song and some of the others but some of the songs where beter then the origanlas i never think i would listen to n2gether now so much and the reagaged song is asome also the p diddy remix is cool too i admit could be better defently not there best but still pritty good.If your a die hard fan then this cd is for you but if your not then your just gonna turn into another cridic and say its ... without realizeing how good it really is.
4,limp bizkit hater loves it,"Limp bizkit fans hate it. Yeb. This is a hip-hop album. Neptunes, P diddy, DJ Premier, Timbaland are all here. What an album. It's no rap-rock sh1t. No wonder it doesn't get good review from limp fans. Neptunes fans would love it. I love it."
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD.....I would not say it is their best...but it is definatly up there on the list....the N 2 Gether Now Remix has a great beat and stays in your head ""Whats that I didn't hear ya come on a little louder."""
2,"Limp, you're better than this!",This was the first of a string of remix album released by artists in late 2001 and early 2002; unfortunately this is probably the worst. Did we really need three versions of four songs? You want a great remix album? Go check out Linkin Park's Reanimation; that is GENIUS!
1,this cd is wrong,Well well.Bizkit is now the latest craze to rap fans.How interesting.Wes has left and now this.LB had a good thing going with $3 Dollar Bill Ya'll and Significant Other.so maybe Chocolate Starfish was pretty dissapointing but you'd think after that they'd put out a good record to make up for it or at least make heavier remixes.I guess you couls say Limp's original rap/metal flavor has been ruined.Don't get excited for Bizkit's next album.
2,THE TWO NEPTUNES REMIXES ARE HOT!,"I don't like Limp Bizkit and I don't care for their brand of ""music"".BUT I caught ear to the two mixes that the now ubiqtious Neptunes did.And found them good.The lively funky reworking of ""N2Gether Now"" has a sick beat and their livelyremix of the otherwise brainless self-pity anthem ""Nookie"" are hot enough tobuy this remix album just for those two alone(especially ""N2Gether Now"").I don't care about Limp Bizkit BUT as a fan of the Neptunes,those two mixes make meantipate the release of ""In Search Of...""-the duo's album as N.E.R.D.-which I wonder if folks will be ready for..."
2,Waste,They keep repeating the same thing over and over. The only reason I give them 2 stars is because the beats are pretty ok. I could have gotten that in a hip hop instumental CD though. Its an excuse for no new songs.
1,Don't Bother,"I'm a fan of Limp Bizkit, I think the talk about sell outs etc is lame and if you don't like the music don't listen but I have bought all three of their Cds and I'm relatively pleased. (...) There is no nice way of putting it. There are a few tracks, maybe three that are ok. Most of the songs lyrics are over repetative where after two minutes of the same thing again and again you're ready to never play that track again. You keep waiting for the DJ to switch it up but the switch never happens until you switch tracks. I advice DL if you want a song don't waste your cash. The good songs I've found are ""N-2-Gether"", ""My Way (P-Diddy Remix)"" and ""Nookie (Butch Vig Remix""."
2,Limp Bizkit New Old Songs Satisfactory,"This Limp Bizkit cd is good (some tracks). 5-6 tracks are repeating one phrasers like Fatboy Slim. They melody of the others aren't disguishing but, they are pretty good. The best track is Counteirfeit Remix and My Way Remixed By DJ Premier (BONUS TRACK). Listen to this cd, download it,or burn it. Definitely not worth paying for but, worth getting for free."
1,Yawn!,"So unbelievabley boring , somone suggested it be good for a party ..sure if the party was full of potheads...This is the worst cd ever...if youre looking for a well put togatha ''remix/rock'' cd get reanimation from Linkin Park , i dont see how people compare LP too Limp...their both really different...But this cd is horrible!!"
1,The WORST cd of all time!!!,"This is cd is sooooooo terrible, it's not even funny. What happened to this band????? Three-Dollar Bill Y'all was an AWESOME cd and now they're producing ..this? ..."
1,Limp Bizkit+New Old Songs=Sell-Outs!!!,"Limp Bizkit was a terrible band to start out with, but this shows you that they have completely drop dead, this is so terrible, and makes me really dislike this band with a rage. Major sell outs, but wait nobody wasted their time buying this cd, because they knew limp bizkit really did bad this time!So what ever you do, don't waste your money buying this cd! It's not worth it, instead buy Incubus: Make Yourself, or KoRn self titled, or Flaw: Through the Eyes, because those are great Cd's, but this isn't!!!"
1,Limp Bizkit gone from bad to worse,"Back when Three Dollar Bill Y'all$ came out, I (and all my crew) thought Limp Bizkit was top ish in this business. They were heavy, Fred could sing, and rap, but mix it up real nice. Significant Other came out, and showed a change in the Limp, which I seen as good and bad. They were a little less hard, more pop in their sound. They were still rockin though, and great for a pit... so I liked it. Chocolate Starfish pushed the limit. Few of the songs were of great Limp like the old stuff, and this album has killed everything. Significant and Starfish each had one nothin-but-rap song on them, and that was definitely BAD ENOUGH!!! Now, Limp has released an entire album which does nothing but turn their old hits, which were great freakin' songs, into worthless vocals over RAP BEATS!!! The best part of Limp old and new had been Wes' guitar rythyms.....so much for that. This is one deadly sin Limp should never have made!!!"
1,This sucks,"If you thought the original versions were bad, then these mixes will leave your mouthfeeling like hell. For good rap-metal listen to Rage Against the Machine, Body Count and E-Town Concrete, and for good music in general listen to Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Sepultura, Metallica (hell, even the new stuff's better than this crap!), Anthrax, Sevendust, etc."
1,I've heard better from limp bizkit,"If you campare this cd to their other cd's, then this one sounds like a lot of crap. If you don't want to take my word then you can spend 15 dollars on a load of what should have been better."
1,Pure (Garbage)...,"I don't own the CD, but I have heard most of the songs on it and I have to say this is a piece of (garbage). I own the three studio albums by Limp Bizkit,have enjoyed them all, and consider myself a big Limp fan. The songs, though, on New Old Stuff(just when I thought the last album had a bad name) are just plain horrible. The remix for Nookie is one of the worst. What happened to the rest of the lyrics in the song. In the break stuff remix,, the words do not even go with the beat. I cannot say enough this album (is bad). The only people that would like some of the songs on this album are pure rap fans and the like. I personally am a hard rock fan. I like the way they mixed rap and rock. Unfortuately they are moving more and more towards a pure rap album sound. I hope they reverse this trend soon, because if this album is any indication of their future albums, they will lose this fan."
