1,Big problem with thid DVD player,"This DVD player is capable to read only half of DVD's in the market place. Is a firmware exist to correct that situation? I don't know... In many cases this Konka DVD player will stop to read a DVD in some parts of a film... But when it's working images are very good... Meanwhile, it should be always good to read DVD's..."
4,KD1800U1 does support DTS,"Just want to point out one mistake in the Amazon review above. This player does have DTS digital out. The older model KD1800U does not. By the way, the pictures shown above are KD1800U, which is replaced by KD1800U1."
1,Only plays 50% of all DVDs,"Most frustrating experiences with this DVD player. I do the same thing with any DVD disc. Open the player, insert the DVD and then this *** machine decides whether to read it or not. If it decides not then I get an ""invalid operation"" report on the top left of the screen. It makes no sense. For instance on The West Wing Series 2, it played the first and second side of Disc 1 but it refuses to read and play either side of Disc 2. I have gone to the extent of playing these rejected discs on another DVD player and they play fine. Can anyone help or is this a lost cause?"
3,BE CAREFUL,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 76 YEAR OLD MOTHER WHICH MEANT THAT I HAD TO SET UP THE SYSTEM. SINCE SHE HAD AN OLDER TV, I HAD TO RUN THE CONNECTION VIA AN EVEN OLDER VCR. FORGET IT. I ENDED UP BUYING HER A NEW TV/VCR 25"" COMBO TO ACCOMMODATE THE DVD. WORKS WELL AFTER ALL THE ASSOCIATED PURCHASES.MY PET PEEVE - AND IT IS EXEMPLIFIED WITH THIS UNIT - IS POOR MANUAL DIAGRAMS AND EVEN WORSE WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS. WITH THIS UNIT, IT'S WORSE THAN POOR. THESE COMPANIES WOULD BE WELL ADVISED TO HIRE ENGLISH GRADS TO REDO ALL THEIR OWNERS MANUALS. INSTRUCTIONS ARE POOR - POOR - POOR - HAIR PULLING TERRIBLE."
4,It Is Worth the Money!!!,"I am not a huge electronics freak so this was a great puchase for me...my first DVD player and what a good looking bargain! I don't care about a fancy remote because all of my other remotes are not backlit,and I have the intelligence to memorize button locations after a few runs. As for drive noise well... I will admit about 15 percent of the time the drive will act up and a bit of noise, but again I am intelligent enough to block it out and turn up my stereo speakers. It plays movies as well as any brand I have seen and sounds as equal. The fancy rear connections that may be missing do not mean much to me right now, but hell I have other things to worry about in life than the best of the best DVD players, when in my mind I have exactly what I need...a superior affordable Konka! Buy it Today!"
1,Philips 109 B4,This monitor [stinks]!!! I first bought one but I exchange it because it had 3 black pixels. The next one had 4!!! The next one had only 2 but in the lower corners the image was distorted. As a design it looks great but I all 19`` Philips monitor have this problem (black pixels). So if U want a 19`` monitor DON`T BUY PHILIPS!...
3,"Cold maybe, but not freezing....","Plot revolves around this female who was gang raped as a young woman, moved to Toyko and rebuilt her life. Life was good until the men from her past reappear and threaten her future. Her method of dealing with them was drastic to say the least but not too plausible. SPOILER WARNING: freezing the men and thereby keeping them contained in her past, literally and figuratively on one level, yet not on another, because she had to constantly deal with the issue of keeping them frozen, was an interesting premise (she could never keep them in her past despite the freezing and ultimately choose death, maybe?) but it never came close to fulfilling its potential. Film is not worth a second viewing. However, I would be interested in watching subsequent films by this director (Takashi Ishii) before writing him off."
4,The Ice Queen Cometh,"Is this a serious film that makes the viewer think and rouses discussion as the end credits roll? Nah, but it is FUN. You basically know whats going to happen, but watching it all (you guys out there will especially like the shower scenes) is what this is all about. Hey, the best horror movies are the ones that you can watch without feeling like the writer/director is trying to give off some moral platitude about the state of society. Horror movies are made for those of us who get a thrill out of getting scared and seeing other people die (fictionally, that is)."
2,worst game ever!,"I'll give you all of the flaws in this game,#1:the season mode in this game is worse than the shut your mouth season,because the know your role season is 4 solid years,shut your mouth is only 2 years.#2:Trish stratus is ugly.Her face is just two black holes,a big old witch nose,and she actually comes out with shean morley.And finally #3:The hell in the cell match,when you climb the cage and fall down yor opponent stays on the cage and beefs up the crowd while you lay helplessly on the ground.so if you belive me I implore you to not get this game.that was bassil 6:13 speaking,over and out..."
2,Good. Not great.,"This game is cool, but could've been better. It's much better than Wrestlemania 2000 on N64. However, the gameplay is way too fast, and the Season mode takes way too long. Buy Smackdown on Playstation 2."
3,"Come on, everyone...","""Well, I haven't played this game yet, but everyone says it's awesome, so it is!"" This is what I've been reading throughout most of the reviews for this game. Come on people, how can you say this game is great when you've only seen a few screen shots and heard some of this-and-that about it. I read the same thing about the first SMACKDOWN before it came out, and that game stunk. Don't say it didn't, because it did. If the create-a-wrestler in this game is anything like in the original SMACKDOWN this will be disappointing. I'm not saying this will be a horrible game, and I'm not saying it will be a great game, because I don't know, I haven't played it yet. I've been to a very good site with daily news and tons of screen shots of this game and it does look really good. I'm just saying don't act like it's all great when you haven't even played it yet."
3,Smackdown 2: Know Your Role,"This is the best wrestling game I had ever played for playstation. Its graphics and gameplay, it's very similar to the first SmackDown. Besides season mode, players can fight in ladder, table, and chair matches. Their battles can spill over into back areas, in which furniture and even traffic abound. Wrestlers can even drive a forklift over their opponents for particularly painful results. All of the ring entrances are there in fine detail. Players also can create their own wrestler with hair, weight, and accessory options that rival those of any wrestling game out there."
3,"For a smackdown fan, This game deserved 5 stars!","If you were a smackdown fan this game is really fun. But, if your not a fan, well this game is still ok."
4,Finally....The Game is Here!,"This was one of the first wrestling games that I truely got into. Although I may be a bit biased towards it, I enjoy many of the features that were first introduced in this game. Also the further you moved through the game, the more chances you had to unlock new characters, clothing, body parts, and even matches. It is fun to recreate some of the old matches that were popular during the attitude era of the WWF. On the downside, it can be a bit booring waiting for your chance to wrestle during the season mode. All in all I give it a 4 out of 5 stars just for replay alone."
4,the best and the longest smackdown game ever,"This is the most in depth Smackdown game, even to this day Because you have to go week by week, match by match and you can do by yourself or with 3 other people in season mode.It Actually takes longer than A couple of hours to beat the game.The create a wrestler is also very extensive, and you can also create taunts,and PPV's.Basically the way the whole game is done is perfect I wish they would do it this way on the newer games."
5,The best game from thq since pong,This game is great!I love all the differant modes you can pick.The hell in the cell match and the tlc match conquers all the rest of them.hope this helps you people.
5,this game brings the smackdown to your living room,"I've seen reviews about the game and movies and screenshots and i will be first in line to buy it at toysrus. The game features some modes you could not have imagined on sd2. There is the tag team table match, ladder match,hardcore match,HIAC match,special guest referee,new ppv,etc. I also think that this game is appropriate for kids there is no blood wich is why i will let my kid buy it. I would have to say after taking a look at the reviews i would let my 11 year old son buy it even though im not a fan of the wwf or wrestling all together."
3,Not bad.....,"This game is dissapointing considering all the hipe that went with it. The gameplay, although fairly easy, is not as good as the origional Smackdown!, The graphics are exellent but the sound is terrible. I like the amount of different types of matches there is and the create a Wrestlers is superb. The season mode is good because of all the video clips but I can't stand the way you have to see little meters for each Wrestler go down when you don't want to watch a match. And if THQ want to know, there are 9 matches in a PPV.If you're a WWF fan I would recomen it but not if you aren't. As for me.....WCW Mayhem. The King of ALL Wrestling games!"
5,Best wrestling game in the history of the playstation,Smackdown 2 is the best game ever. You have got over 60+ wrestlers. Over 20+ matches. The best match is the hell in a cell. You can create a wrestler which is the best thing about it. You can pick over 200 moves. The season mode is where you got real shows Raw and Smackdown. No more house shows. It lasts over 20 years. You just gotta get this game if your a wrestling fan. If you don't have one this game your not a true wrestling fan. This game is a lot better than No Mercy!!!
5,I haven't slept for weeks.,"This is the kind of game that keeps you up at nights, because there is so much fun stuff to do. I love creating wrestlers, you have 1,000's of options to choose from. Then you can enter those wrestlers into wwf seasons and watch them work their way to the title. The game is not too hard and not too easy; just right for hours of entertainment. The graphics are decent, a bit on the pixled side, but not too distracting. But, man, there are so many things to do: create a pay-per-view, create a manager, create a taunt, create a stable, etc. All the characters are here, and it was fun unlocking guys like Shawn Michaels. There are 100's of things to unlock in this game: from other wrestlers, to eye colors for your create-a-wrestler category. It is definately worth your money. Buy this game.Oh! Forgot the best part! The ring entrances rock."
4,pretty good but not enough for a true WWF fan,"This is a very impresive game for the PS. Good graphics, good gameplay, and very addictive. There are many flaws though. One is that there is no commontary. Second is that there is all of these old wrestlers that dont wrestle any more like Mark Henry, Gangrel, Viscera, and about half of the others. Another is that you should be able to control your charactor when he/she is not in a match in season. I hate how weapons dont do any damage. I mean punching your opponent hurts them more than a ladder. the last thing is you cant go into the audience and the audience looks like animated cardboard cut-outs. There are so many more but they are smaller things that arent really noticable when you play. I am not trying to tell you not to get this game but there are just so many problems that THQ just ignored. There is one thing i forgot. they should really make BLEEMcast for this game."
5,wcw and ecw vs wwf,part two is cool u get to do more then u could do in part one of smackdown but when wwf smackdown just bring it part three comes out it well be better then the last two on the playstation 2
1,...,This game is the worst game ever. I can't believe THQ made this dumb game. They are good game producers but they fell apart in creating this game. As soon as I played one match of this game I took it out of the system and went outside and burned it up.That is what I think about this horrible game.
3,Please read!,"Well theres not much to say than,this game is ok,but the graphics are kind of bad for this day in age.Its gameplay kind of hard too.Any playstaion 1 game from thq will probably not be good.Th best game they have made was smackdown 1 and i would give it a 2 out of 5 stars.Theres not a lot of difference in the matches.I would have to say that ecw hardcore revaloution,and wwf atitude would beat this game anyday."
5,The Rock's Cookin Smackdown 2!,"The power THQ has came back and The Rock will beat up Chris Benoit. And Y2J's gonna come in there and help The Rock do it! And maybe the Undertaker is gonna rise from the dead once more, go get Billy Gunn and together they'll be Nice Men. And maybe X-Pac's gonna come in with HHH and thogether they'll ... It! And Owen Hart's coming from th celing and B00M the string cuts and Owen lays there motionless or should I say dead. Viscera's coming rolling over poor Road Dogg and, Viscera's pinning Road Dogg and, the car comes and rolls them over in Anywhere Fall. And Matt hardy ripping off Mankind's mask. And that's it folks."
3,WWF Smackdown! 2 isn't all that hot!,"I bought Smackdown 2 about 3 and a half weeks ago, and well actually it's gonna pretty much everything you expected it to be, but really and truly it gets really boring. I'll tell you why. Because the moves are so limited and there is really little to choose from and soon u'll find urself wanting to pick different characters until you don't want to pick the loser guy or the person who sucks and ur fun is gonna be squashed pretty quickly.Also in what they call normal mode almost everything u do will get reversed when ur a beginner and u'll realise that u haft to do quick moves which get boring because u want to see the strong stuff and the special matches arent all that as well. this game is ok. and if ur not hard to please then get it."
4,great for die hard wwf fans!,"it's like smackdown 1 but twice as good, ladder matches, table matches, alot more customizable options such as the create a wrestler go into more detail. the graphics are pretty sharp compared to other playstation games i have seen. two things trouble me about the game, the load times are long and when you play season mode even if you skip a match you have to watch the power bars and wait while some scenes to load that really aren't worth waiting for, otherwise it's a pretty decent game for tru hardcore wwf fans, I think you can get your money's worth if you can't get enough of wwf like me. if you have the old smackdown it takes about a week to get used to some changes in the game (like the increased AI)."
3,A Good Wrestling Game For The Playstation,"SmackDown 2 ""Know Your Role!"" is a good wrestling game BUT dont buy it because ya'll be disappointed.The graphics are not all that good the constite waiting as you watch your favorite wrestler stare at you when you wait for the game to load.believe me its probably not worth the money to buy this game.save your money for the new smackdown game coming out for playstation 2.but if your a real hardcore fan of the wwf like me than go ahead and buy it."
2,Will someone please tell me why this is such a hot game?,"All right, Lets be honest here, SD2 isn't that great. I mean, the glitchy graphics are horrible. I don't like the fact that I can't do moves onto weapons. Then I'm on the top of the Cell closelining Kane and he is suddenly behind me preforming a Death Drop DDT to me through the cage. It's just not that realistic. And of course then there's the wonderful time I have staring at a picture of Tazz while the graphics load. When it comes out on the Playstation2 it will be a lot better, for that loading time will hopefully just about vanish. But its not all bad. I like running over Undertaker in the Commissionermobile."
3,More Like an Update,"Smackdown 2 is more of an update than a sequel. If you have the first game, then there's really no point to getting this one. Season mode is really sucks. There is endless loading time and forces you to load cutscences that have nothing to do with you. In fact, some of the load time is longer than the movies.Don't get me wrong, this is a great game with loads of new matches, but if you have the first one, there's really no amibition to play."
2,"WWF SmackDown! 2 Know Your Role: Loading, Loading, Loading","While the lastest and greatest wrestling game for playstation is much improved, it may be just a little too advanced for playstation, as it seems all you do is look at pictures of your favorite wrestlers while the graphics are constantly loading. Once you actually get into the matches though, the game play is pretty fun, with all the special moves of each wrestler. There is a need for commentary from the real announcers to give this game a more realistic feel. Overall a game that I can't wait to see on Playstation2, because all the loading time won't be there anymore."
5,"Great Game, Not Enough Time To DO It ALL","This is the best wrestling game I have ever played. The only draw back that I can think of is all the loading time. It can get frusterating at times especially during the Royal Rumble. I am 3 years into my season and have unlocked numerous characters from Stone Cold, Cactus Jack, Mick Foley, Mean Street Posse to even The Stooges and Michael Cole. All the different options and matches make this the most addicting game I have ever purchased. You never want to stop playing your season because you want to know what is going to happen next. It kind of bothered me that I had to fight Benoit like 5-7 times in a row, but its ok. The story lines make it fun and things can change if u know how(ADD A MANAGER TO YOUR WRESTLER OR CREATE A STABLE). I love this game and reccomend it to wrestling fans everywhere and I promise that you will never e-e-e-e-e-ever find a better wrestling game."
1,Sorry -,"This is only an opinion, and don't get all cranky over it. I bought this game for forty bucks after months and months of playing both WCW Mayhem and BackStage Assault for playstation, within a few days of constant playing and frustration this game was being returned to the store i bought it. while this game has great features, good graphics and endless possibilities. The play control and pulling off moves and finishers is horrible and limiting. Unless your a hardcore WWF fan i wouldn't suggest buying this if your interested in a wrestling game."
5,if ya smell what thq is cookin,"wwf smackdown 2 is one hell of a game.without a shout of a doubt this is the best wrestling game on ps1.with high flying ladder matches,cage,tables,and a hell in a cell.this game is a must buy."
4,This is an amazing game!,This game is pretty cool except for the loading. The season mode is probably the most boring part of the game because if your wrestler is not even in the match you can't even skip it. If you do skip it then have to watch street fighter-like thing. Plus sometimes you are not in an event. The rest of this the game is awesome! You can create stables and managers. The CAW part of the game is fun too. It is much more advanced than Smackdown 1. Be sure to enter exibition mode. It is truely the best part of the game.
5,Awesome Game!,"I bought this game thinking that it might be just like Smackdown1. It turns out that not only that there are updated players, (like Rikishi) or new people to unlock, there are new kinds of matches like table matches, and ladder matches, and casket matches. There are also all different kinds of videos in a season. The one bad thing about this game is that there is a lot of loading involved but with a game like this it's definatley worthit!"
4,"Smackdown 2, better than the first?","There are many ways THQ has improved Smackdown 2 from the original Smackdown. I greatly enjoyed the new TLC and Table matches, not to mention my favorite, the Hell in the Cell. I do wish that THQ would incorporate some of the ideas that Acclaim had in their original WWF games. I think if you took the features of Acclaim's WWF Attitude, and THQ's Smackdown 2, and combined them, you would have an excellent Wrestling game. For the ""DIE HARD"" WWF fan such as myself, aspects such as the entrances, and the wrestler's authentic gestures are very important. If they decide to come out with a Smackdown 3, I think they should concentrate a bit more on improving the entrances, and the oh so important Create a wrestler mode. Find a way to extend the entrances, and throw in the ""true"" fireworks, and the game will explode! Good job this time around, but there is still plenty of room for improvement!"
5,Excellent!,"My devotional group used this book for our study circle every week and we found it to be very powerful. Each week we read a new chapter and discussed it. It is a great explanation of Sai Baba's teachings. I would recommend this book to any spiritual seeker who wants a good guide for all the various all the various aspects of spirituality: Truth, Faith, Non-Violence, Devotion, and so on. This book gets to the essence. It is simple, yet naturally still a lot of work to apply in real life."
5,Jonathan Roof Himself A Pathway to God,"Thank you to Leela Press and Jonathan Roof for this beautiful book.I have one slight criticism: Sai Baba has tens of thousands of quotes about universal ahimsa or nonviolence to every living being. Re a passage on page 141 Jonathan Roof says 'we are sometimes compelled to harm small insects..in maintaining the order of a home'. Baba has never said insects should be killed. To protect from termites, build with stone, brick, or block. To protect from cockroaches, put food in sealed dishes. God bless you Jonathan for writing this book."
1,Simple Horrible don't waste your money,"ITs horrible. Its a high school film done by the kids who got a D in their film making class. Ok story, but horrible shooting, except the very first scene, horrible sound, bad music, it is just GARBAGE start to finish. Bad lighting, bad acting, bad dialog, but a good villian who's a bisexual girl."
5,Dynamic Perspectives,This movie is incredibly rich with symbolism. The ideals that are reflected... are many times what one sees in the mirror of themselves.
1,Save your money!,"If I could give this a lower rating, I'd do it. The videotape I received was a hideously butchered version of what may once have been a remarkable film. If THIS version is the one that won the plaudits claimed for it, then those who gave the awards must have been blind and mad. The publisher, Timeless Video, Inc., further mutilated the film by tacking on a ridiculously inappropriate sound track, starting with tunes from the musical 'Gigi'! (This I could fix: I turned the sound all the way down.) Photos on the tape's dust jacket are NOT from this film, and the dust jacket looked nothing like the one Amazon shows for this item. Because of the film's butchered condition, the plot made almost no sense--successive scenes often seem unrelated. Much of the film is very hard to see due to light flares, scratches, etc. Certainly I'll be very wary of ordering any videos from this site again, and I'll definitely never order one published by Timeless Videos."
1,Disappointed to read about the Quality,"I am very disappointed to read that this is apparently the shoddy public doman transfer of this film that has been around for years.The shame is that we *KNOW* that beautiful looking masters of the film ARE in existence because of the documentary THE WONDERFUL HORRIBLE LIFE OF LENI REIFENSTAHL, which presents **gorgeous** looking clips from this film.I won't be buying this one, because I already own the awful transfer being talked about here.I had hoped to find a pristineversion like the clips in WHLIFE.Hopefully someday!John"
4,Cow Bell,This was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something my mother-in-law could ring if she fell or had other problems when walking with her walker. The bell is very loud.
2,"Looks great, but design flaw.","Bought this for my bathroom remodel and loved the way it looked. From the beginning, the arm would loosen immediately. The installer and my husband redid it 4 or 5 times, and it still loosens. I agree with the reviewer that, unless you can install on a stud, it will mean perpetual tightening. I am replacing it with a dual post."
3,gg,"The item is attractive and serves its designed function well. However, there seems to be an engineering problem in that it does not remain attached solidly to the wall. It ""torks"" when accidently bumped or if any pressure is placed on the bar (as commonly happens when children use it for a pull bar arising from the toilet)"
4,Good stuff,"Looks nice and it is robust, very easy to mount too. I need nine more words for this to be approved:)"
2,Durability issues,"The product looks great and is easy to install. But, after a week of use I am not sure it is going to make it more than a few months.The horizontal bar has already loosened from the post and the toilet paper has taken on a bit of a lean. It no longer sits perfectly level.I will take it down and see if there a screw that can be tightened between these two parts, but really, why do I have to do that?Oh right... I paid $16 for a toilet paper holder.Obviously, this could be solved if the arm and the post were cast as one piece. Obviously, such a product wouldn't cost $16.If you are one of those people that doesn't notice little things like the toilet paper looking slightly crooked, then 5 stars- it looks great and is cheap.If you are like me and do notice such things... steer clear and save yourself the daily frustration of thinking about how you can't get something that performs as expected for under $100."
2,Needs better support,"I like the modern look and it goes with the rest of the set I purchased, but the hardware to keep it into the wall isn't very strong."
2,POOR QUALITY WITH MOUNTING PLATE METAL,"BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE BUT POOR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REGARDING THE MOUNTING SYSTEMTHIS COMPANY COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY (AND LESS EXPENSIVELY) MADE A FIXED SCREW OR ALLEN SCREW ON THEBOTTOM MATEING UP TO A SQUARE PLATE BEHIND THE COVER PLATEUPON TIGHTENING THE EXISTING SET SCREWS, THE TORQUE APPLIED LITERALLY DAMAGED THE MOUNTING PLATE TWICETO THE POINT THAT IT COULD NO LONGER BE USED, THEY SENT ME A COUPLE OF MORE, BUT AGAIN IT BECAME AN ISSUEOF THE LOW QUALITY OF THE METAL THAT WAS USED IN THE MOUNTING PLATE! IT WAS TOO WEAK FOR THE SET-SCREW!!!"
2,Try to find a stud,"Our contractor installed this with wall anchors (not sure if he used the included ones) and it tilted enough to be ineffective after about 2 months. We jiggled it a bit to see if we could adjust the wall plate, and the whole thing fell out onto the floor in a pile of drywall dust.Otherwise, the finish and heft are very attractive, and it looked nice with the towel bar and robe hook."
3,Great product but...,Flat end of the holder unscrewed and there is no way to put it back. Now have to purchase a new one... Otherwise I really like it.
3,Great Music Ruined By Groaning,"This is a fantastic lineup that will challenge your ear, but beware of Masabumi Kikuchi's atrocious groaning noises. You might think you know the territory if you've heard a lot of Keith Jarrett, but I can assure you, there is no comparison here. From the very first moment of the disc, Kikuchi starts in with his vomiting cat impression and it overshadows everything that is otherwise great about this record. Why Motian and Stefan Winter chose to keep these sounds so high in the mix baffles me. For that reason alone, I cannot recommend this disc, which is a shame because the rest of the band is in fine form. Chris Potter's ""Pas de deux"" is a highlight."
1,Software needs help!,I bought the Epson Perfection 4180 to scan several hundred slides and photos. In the beginning the scanner would only scan slides. I reloaded software... nothing... I scanned all of my slides and disconnected scanner so I could use my old scanner for photos. I reconnected the Epson 4180 to scanner more slides... and now it will only scan photos... NO SLIDES?!? I have spent HOURS working to troubleshoot this scanner. I recommend you AVOID the Epson Scanner!!!
2,Inadequate Software,"The software provided to operate the scanner is woefully inadequate.One of the things I need to do is scan documents for electronic filing. For this I need a fast scan and a small file. Two programs are provided for this sort of work. EpsonScan is very fast, provides small files but will not scan multiple page documents - you wind up with lots of files. No way of merging them is provided.The other program - Epson Smart panel will scan multiple documents but it is ponderously slow and produces very large files.There is no way of fast scanning multiple pages with small files. Epson support suggest third party software. I have solved the problem by using PaperPort but this is inconvenient.A scanner of this quality deserves better software than this."
2,Poorly made,"I have no complaints about the quality of the scans. But after about a year and a half, the pulley mechanism came loose from the floor of the unit. I opened it up and I can see that the pulley, which has considerable tension, is held down by two tiny, thin plastic tabs. It is easy for them to break, and once one does, there is no way to secure the pulley bracket in place. I can just see them saying that these flimsy tabs are going to last as long as the warranty period and then the consumer has to buy another unit. Unbelievably poor workmanship. I think this model is no longer in production, but if it's any indication of what current Epson products are like, beware."
1,no help,I bought my Epson perfection 4180 Photo scanner 13 months ago. After using it no more than 50 times The machine will not work. According to the manual it seems the bulb is no good. I tried to buy a new bulb from Epson but they don't sell it. It keeps saying send to your dealer. One would think the bulb should last more than 13 months. Of course it had a one year warranty. Epson sucks
1,It may have been a great scanner,It may have been a great scanner if it wasn't always out of stock every time I tried to order one. Jody Bissoon
3,Broke in two weeks,"I thought the scanner did a good job scanning etc. In two weeks the scanning arm jammed and failed to work.(I scanned 500 negitives) The troubling part is at the epson web site, they failed to answer any Email request for help. The good news is amazon is sending another scanner. So there is a happy ending. Amazon responded on the first email."
2,Worked well until day 4,"I had scanned a few slides. It was slow but they turned out well. If you have to scan a lot of slides though I would not recommend this scanner because it will take a very long time. The following two days, I scanned some photos that seemed OK. On day four when I turned the scanner on there was a loud grinding noise and the red light started flashing. I went over the troubleshooting steps and there is nothing I can do but return it."
5,Simply one of the best shows ever,"Cool cops, lots of action, interesting guest stars, great music, Edward James Olmos emoting like mad, and amazingly atmospheric cinematography combine to create the seminal TV show of the 1980s."
5,Miami Vice,"My husband and I loved this programme when it first aired in the U.K. back in the early 80's. It went out on a Monday night at 9pm and everything in the household stopped, then you talked about it all the next day with your workmates. I was devasted when Crocketts wife played by Sheena Easton got murdered. I purchased this double DVD as a suprise gift for my husband and he loves it, has watched it over and over again, I think he's reliving his youth. Can't wait for the others to follow"
5,They work,"They work, they are cheap, what more could you ask for?They work, they are cheap, what more could you ask for?"
5,Good quality cable at a low price.,"I would recommend this cable to anyone seeking a good, cheap stereo to male RCA cable. The delivery was prompt as always and the cable worked well to my standards."
4,Good cheap cable,"A good cheap cable, If it's hooked up to something you don't move around a lot it should last a long time."
4,Product works well with my Nexus One,"Does it's job, nothing special about it. Not the best looking cables but they were a good price and work great with my Nexus One connected to my AV receiver. I've had issues with other cables that were cheaply made where my phone would skip to the next song or rewind or pause because something was shorting those controls in the phone. But these cables don't do that at all - they work well."
1,4 Episodes?,"It's cool that they put these out, seeing as how THEY HAVEN'T DONE SEASON BOXES YET?? But, 4 episodes for this price and they think this is an Ultimate Villian Showdown?? I don't think so. Just rent it and burn a copy."
3,Not bad,"Ok, so it's a topical 'buy' right now, but if you've ever been a fan of the series, you'll probably appreciate this DVD. The quality is not too bad (not great either), but it does have a few neat features.Aside from the main story and that very-dated first episode of 1967, you'll also get bonus material of a select villain 'bios' (each with an accompanying interview with Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee). While Lee didn't create all of these bad-guys, the main ones are covered and their 1st introduction to our lives is chronicled in the volume/number classification (with date).The 1st episode is very dated (as I said) but could be because we're a much more sophisticated audience now. However, the perspectives are pretty amateur (surprising) as are the clearly recycled panels that are constantly being re-introduced. The editing between interview (of creator Lee) and flashes of animation are abysmal too (alas). However, as an inexpensive addition to your library, this really isn't too bad a buy."
3,It's OK,"Someone once said that if you want to see how much adults hate children, just watch Saturday morning cartoons. The thing that makes this DVD worthwhile is the first episode of the classic 60's series featuring the theme song. They would've done better to add additional episodes of that series as the ""origin"" episode is usually the weakest. That seems to be the problem with this collection of cartoons from the 90's - they have to waste time with the origins of the super-villains instead of just letting them, blow stuff up. The origin of all these characters are going to be preposterous, just run with it!"
4,"It's great, but sad not to see Venom!","Don't get me wrong, I love this DVD. I just think they picked the wrong episodes for Spider-Man's first time on DVD. But the episodes them selfs are great. I hope to see more Spider-Man DVD's in the future. If you love Spider-Man, this is a must have."
5,kids love,my sons are having a spiderman marathon and im trying to collect nost of these series he enjoys this movie and he dresses up in his costumes when he watches these movies thanks
3,"Disapointing, but if you're a spidey-fan get it","I was so psyched when I heard of Spiderman TAS episodes on DVD. Unfortunately, I felt ripped off. All the episodes (with the exception of the Green Goblin episode) were plain stupid. I expected better episodes. Perhaps the story of the Black Costume Saga(Origin of Venom). Nevertheless, the special features on this DVD were outstanding. An interactive super villains gallery, original spiderman episode, and the interviews almost made up for the disapointing choice of episodes. Despite my negative criticism, its a must-have for Spidey fans."
4,Great for the comic book fans,"This DVD is right out of the comic book. From the mention of the Hob Goblin to the Green Goblin tossing exploding pumpkins at Spidey. It has four episodes and we all know the first one all too well: Peter Parker gets bit and his uncle gets killed, etc.The next two episodes are great followed by what I would classify as a time filler in the fourth episode.Overall rating would have been a ""5"" had it not been for the weak last episode. Dr. Octopus, Green Goblin, and Kingpin are just how I remember them from my early years reading the comic.Recommended for super hero comic fans and, of course, Marvel fans of all ages."
4,A Brief Introduction to Spider Man.,"This video contains four cartoons from the 1990's Spider Man series that aired on the Fox Kids network. The four episodes are parts 2-5 of the ""Sins of Our Fathers"" story arc. Part Two gives the origins of Spider Man while Part Four illustrates the rise of the Green Goblin.The final part of the tape includes the 1967 cartoon ""The Origins of Spider-Man"". The animation is really bad (after all it was 1967), but is worth watching just to hear that great theme song a couple of times.A decent animated collection that works well as an introduction to who Spider Man is."
2,"Very, Very Disappointing","When I got this DVD, I was hoping for the classic '60s episodes, not the techno '90s which are so dumbed down and PC as to be essentially unwatchable. As for the introductions from Stan Lee, I found that after twenty seconds I would just fast forward through them.My seven year old daughter loved the origin of spider-man episode from the '60s and just wasn't interested in the '90s episodes. To be fair, the interactive menu of the different villians was well done.The origin episode is the only reason why I didn't give the DVD 1 star and is the only reason I can think of buying it. The 60's styles, clunky dialog and wooden animation are somehow much warmer and inviting than the tech'd up '90s episodes.Hopefully somebody will pull out the old episodes and put them all on DVD - I'd buy it in a New York minute!"
3,This is a good book. Don't hate!,"I tried these baths. They work! One reviewer said they are wiccan and not santeria. So what! Ashe is ashe. The power of herbs don't increase or decrease based on the name of a system. God given herbs existed long before man made systems.I suspect it didn't require a doctorate degree to compile these baths into a book so I gave it 3 stars instead of 5, but the 3 stars take nothing away from the effectiveness of the book."
1,Herbal baths of...what?,"Santeria is a spiritual Rule, not an opinion of Mr. Montenegro, the herbs in the book are not the real herbs of the Orishas..and the baths...are not the real baths of the Santeria (regla de Ocha). This is a wiccan book, if you want...but not a book of santeria. If you search informations about the real bath of santeria...don't ask to mr. Montenegro!"
4,A roadmap to the dead end.,"This is a very detailed account of the way the Chicago power elite responded to the Great Migration. Detailed, in fact, to the point of opacity. This is a scholarly work written with peer review in mind and therefore crafted for an academic audience.Nonetheless, it was able to give a person unfamiliar with Chicago and urban life (I was raised in the desert) an understanding of the forces that shaped the southside and westside ghettos."
5,Well-written historical account,I had to read this book for a college history class I took 2 years ago and I felt that it was extremely detailed and informative. I was quite surprised by my reaction because I felt it was a great read whether or not you enjoy historical books.
3,Good movie!,"I found it amazing that the film was released during the 50's. The language was harsh for the times and was very daring and un-Hollywood like. Hall of Fame great Jackie Robinson plays himself in the movie. This film could have used an established actor to play him. Even though he was rough around the edges acting wize, Robinson is still entertaining enough for the movie to succeed. The print is in need of restoration. I certainly hope the company who owns the original copy considers saving the print before it's lost forever."
4,Covering it all,"The given book is certainly interesting, and one can get a general view of what were those ""rulers of Mecca"", where they came from and so on. But for those interested in some certain period of Mecca's life the book offers only small bits of information, for it's aim is a bit vague, and it covers just too big a piece of time to give certain details, which, no doubt, are of interest. So, the book may serve as a good starting point to study the history of Hijaz, yet no more, and after reading it (if interested) one has to search further for more to satisfy his appetite."
4,"Nicely made, and well designed......","My plan was not to use this as a computer bag nor as 3 ring binder type catalog/salesman's case. But it would work well for those needs none the less. I'm aware that a valise of this type is very personal, like a purse to a woman. I was wanting a main area that would be amenable to a specific study, like a bible. Have an enclosed full sized note pad, and have various slots for related material and references. The exterior zip pocket is very handy as well, and padded on the outside. This way, I can just open it up, lay it out in my lap or on a table, and have things right there. It will do that. Funny though, there was just a slight odor of leather, so I thought there was ""imitation cow"". I expected more of a 'just walked into a leather store' smell. But they say ""full grain leather"" on all the sites that sell it, so I guess it must be. This is a very nice portfolio for the money, IMHO."
5,Classic Carly,"ANOTHER PASSENGER is, I feel, the quintessential album for Carly Simon fans and new listeners alike... This album combines the classic Carly Simon music and vocalizations that made her famous as well as showing the refinement in her talents since her first albums were released... This is THE album to have if you want to sit back, close you eyes, have a cool drink, share an afternoon or evening with a good friend or special someone...ANOTHER PASSENGER is an unhearalded classic that is destined to ""yet be discovered"" by the masses... If I could only have one albun....this would be the one..."
4,One of my favorites of Carly's,"Powerfully evocative ""It Keeps You Running-"", A hopeful Love Song that builds in it's intensity on ""Libby"".Jealous love vs. Healthy Love in the song ""In Times When My Head"". I replay these songs over and over in my head. She has captured so beautifully in lyrics and melodies the emotional complexity of relationships .I highly recommend this CD."
5,Carly keeps us running,"This is one the best albums Carly ever made. I think it is veryunderestimated. I particularly like the perfect ballads likeriverboat gambler and esp. Libby is unforgettable. ( one of thefew lyrics by Carly in which she refers to Europe. Paris, and Ican remember as a fifteen year old boy being so happy that Carlymentioned Europe - Paris. Thank you Carly. IT IS VERY SAD thatthe original picture on the back of the LP is not included inthe CD!!!. Elektra really should take care of their artwork!!Roger. Europe."
4,"Good but lacks Info on ""the other one""...","I really liked this DVD ""Twin Towers"" & thought it was a great documentary for all to see what officers, especially the ""special units"" go through on a daily basis. Det. Joe Vigiano must have been an amazing person to have known both in his job & his personal life for he seemed to put so much into everything he did.My complaint is that this video should have been called ""Joe Vigiano's Story"" for there was absolutely NOTHING on his brother John. The ""only thing""we found out was that John was a firefighter & he died in the Trader Centers & that's about it. The entire story was about Joe. VERY misleading due to the cover & the info on the back of case."
4,i sensi miei,"i first discovered mango when i ran into his ""mediterraneo"" cd , i liked the cover and the fact that it was italian, so i bought it . now i have every cd he's put out ! in the world of italian music nothing compares to mango , he's a class by himself, his voice is sweet and strong, mellow and rough ! his music is one of the best , the production is unbelievable and unlike other italian rockers that actually got their cd's issued in the u.s , mango is italy's best kept secret !"
2,I need more information,I would like to see more images and know more about the book ¿are those the whole stories in one book?
1,A waste of time,This is a very thin book that offers little practical information beside a short section on the kind of pastels that are available and what papers to use. The technical demonstration is limited to the work of one artist and there is not much progression in the exercises being provided. I do not recommend this book.
1,Not very useful at all...,"I only bought this book because I needed it for one of my college courses along with a key code for the online homework annoyance called Mastering Physics. I found the online site and this book to be completely worthless, having already studied Electricity and Magnetism with a different textbook and found this one to be much worse in comparison on many levels. The examples, the problems, the way they present concepts...all either generic or pointless or possible flawed in some way.If you have a choice in the matter, get a different one. Possibly Feynman's Lectures on Physics."
1,10 lb paperweight,"The title of this book is ""Physics for Scientists and Engineers"", not ""Physics for Science and Engineering STUDENTS"". So if you're a student, this book isn't for you.If you already know what you're doing, this book might be of some use, however the individuals required to use this book are STUDENTS. I HAD a 3.9 until this course. I found a much smaller physics book written in 1941 (back when teachers actually knew how to teach) that explains in 700 pages what it takes this book to explain in 1400.This book adopts the philosophy that pretty pictures and un-related stories can be substituted for actual information. My advice to the author is to cut the garbage and get to the point and save 500 pages. I'm an aero/mechanical engineering student! I don't have time to read fluff!"
1,Bad,This book does not provide in depth problem review. The problem solving skills are not developed well.
1,Resnick and Halliday is much better,I had myself learnt Physics from Resnick and Halliday which I found to be a lot more to the point.
5,great book for engineering physics,"I'm taking physics for engineering at a university level, and I this book was required for the course. I found this book to be great for learning. Chapters are small and broken into easily digested chunks. The examples within the chapters can be attemped using what has been taught previously in the chapter - the examples don't try to teach new things, they just show how a particular concept can be applied (this is very useful). I found this book way better than Giancoli's physics book. This one covers theory as well as problem solving strategies."
3,Just OK.,"This teakettle is not the deep indigo blue that it appears online. And it is smaller than I expected. Then the lid came apart, all by itself. I'm using it now as decoration only. I thought Copco would have been better quality than this."
3,Well...,"This book is a bit of a joke, as far as giving up any real information goes. It's written by a couple of stodgy Brits, and deals with the very most basic aspects of Scandinavian history, vital stats of each country, etc.The big problem is that the book is geared entirely toward helping Brits move to Scandinavia, which is fine, but that's not such a difficult mission; both are members of the EU. For an American, this is like a book about how to move from Virginia to Massachusetts.If you're an American looking to move to Scandinavia, this book might make interesting background study, but if you're looking for information on the red tape you'll encounter, details on work visas, citizenship, etc., you should most certainly look elsewhere."
4,Works as promised,This watch does what it says it does. It's easy to use and it's easy to see the read-out in bright light. The instruction book was helpful with a little interpretation and trial and error. I can usually get a reading without having to stop what I'm doing (usually running or walking). Only minor complaint is the face is a little large and the strap is a little inflexible for small wrists. But I'm satisfied and would buy it again.
4,Nice heart rate monitor for a nice price,"I bought this heart rate monitor to keep my heart rate up in the pool. I used it on several cardio machines in the gym and found that the HR was very similar, with in 2 beats, to the machines built in monitor. It is easy to set up. Inside the pool it is hard to push both buttons at the same time while wet to get a HR reading. That is my only disappointment which was my main purpose for buying it."
2,Should have read the reviews first,"This is the watch for you, if you don't need it to monitor your heart rate. It keeps time, nice light, etc, BUT only works sometimes........I would not purchase again."
2,not so hot,"This watch is fine if you are walking for exercise, but not for much else. While I was running I would ALWAYS have to stop to take my heart rate. If it was over 70/75% it often wouldn't take my heart rate at all. I couldn't even get it to register my heart rate while I was spinning. I would not recommend this watch to anyone who exercises to really push up their heart rate."
5,Great Heart rate Monitor Watch,This is a reallly nice watch - lightweight and attractive. The monitor result is quick. I also like the night light.
1,Poor quality,"I love the functionality and ease of use of this watch, but I've had two now in the last two years. They just aren't made well and don't last. The first one just quit working completely, everything went blank after about a year and changing the battery didn't make a difference. The second one all of a sudden started freaking out, all fields would show 8's and it would just start beeping incessantly until I either removed the battery or it died. This was particularly irritating when it happened at 3am."
2,Not for runners,"Purchased this product to prevent going too fast too soon, I'm running again after sixteen years bringing up children. Only problem is, whenever my heart rate is rapidly approaching my max, the fitwatch fails to give a reading. After I've slowed down it works, however that isn't when I need it."
4,Nice unit,"I like the design and not having a chest strap. Convenient, comfortable, and easy to use. Have to hold still to get heart rate."
2,Could have been better,"I got this about a year ago. I am a little disappointed with this watch. I noticed that there were a few times while running and trying to take my pulse it would just give up and go back to time. The plastic face piece fell off I would have to snap it back on but it kept coming off. It also did not count my laps, this is a feature I had got used to with a previous watch. I did like that it counts down from five seconds on the timer feature. That is the one feature I am going to miss when I replace it."
1,a button broken after one month,Purchased from Amazon and a button broken after one month.Contacted with Reebok but got no feedback.Bad quality and bad service!
3,chipwell,"I liked the idea of not wearing a strap while working out, but in reality they are better. This one works fine, no problem there. But in the middle of your cardio routine you have to stop enough to use the two fingers from your free hand to press on the watch you are wearing and it takes a few seconds (5) to give you the read out. By then your heart rate is already starting to go down. If you want real accurate measurements and you want them at a glance...the strap is the best way to go. You just have to look at the watch to know where your heart rate is."
2,Doesn't work very well,"I bought this heart rate monitor for my daughter who works out regularly. Her feedback is that the monitor does not seem to work very well. First, she has to stop running to take the reading, as other reviewers have mentioned.She finds this annoying because she loses her momentum Then she finds she has to take the reading 4 or 5 times before she gets one that seems reasonable. If you take a few readings within a minute or so, they are not consistent and actually fluctuate quite a bit. She's stopped using it because it appears to be unreliable."
4,Great watch for the money!,"After reading several of the reviews, I was on the fence about buying this watch. I've used mine 3 or 4 times now (during spin class, running and on the elliptical machine so far) and I really like it! It's really cute & comfortable, has a lot of neat features (like the calorie counter) and so far the heart rate readings have been pretty accurate. I haven't had any trouble reaching my wrist like some people mentioned and haven't really had to stop or slow down what I'm doing to take a reading. I'm sure the chest strap models are more accurate and convenient as far as giving you a continuous reading, but if you're no Olympic athlete-in-training and just want something to give you a general idea of how hard you're working, this is a great watch!"
1,"Heart rate function stopped working after 6 weeks, Amazon charged an $8 re-stocking fee","Worked great for the first six weeks, then the heart rate function stopped working. Returned to Amazon, but they charged me an $8 restocking fee. Huh? How can they re-sell it? It's defective. When you place your order, make sure you ask Customer Service to not ship you THIS ONE."
2,Inadequate stopwatch,"The stopwatch feature on this watch does not allow one to record times for splits. For my wife, this is an essential feature in a running watch. Other potential purchasers might not have a problem with this.The heart rate measuring function works sometimes, not always."
1,Reebok Fitwatch10SStrapless Heart Rate Monitor Watch,"Alhtough this was an inexpensive heart rate monitor I was drawn to its simplicity and strapless operation. Trouble is it only recorded my heart rate about a quarter of the time. I tried getting it wet underneath and on probes as recommended(and doing a lot of slobbering; but it still seldom worked. Just finally beeped and went back to the time. It is also difficult to press probes while running and hold and wait. If you want just a watch and timer it is ok. Does not record amount of time spent in ""zone"" that you set. Not recommended."
3,"Not perfect, but not bad","Won't always give a reading and not as convenient to use as some, but not too bad for the price."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"The calorie counter function is extremely inaccurate. In addition, the heart rate function does not work, even after I tried all the suggestions in the manual. In addition, I contacted the manufacturer to see if I could either return the watch or upgrade to a more accurate watch. Since it had been over 30 days since I purchased the watch they would not help me. Do not buy this watch, it is a piece of junk!!"
3,good but not great,"The watch is nice, but is no very accurate on the heart rate. It`s quite cheaper than most of the other heart rate monitor watches, so better know you get what you pay for."
1,Metal buckle sliced right through strap - now useless!,"I loved this watch/monitor. But after just a few uses, the pin attaching the buckle to the plastic strap just sliced right throught the plastic! Imagine butter and a knife, and you'll understand the effect of what happened. This is completely useless now. No idea how they could design such a weak piece of plastic to support a metal pin. That was [...] bucks down the drain!"
1,disappointed,"Calorie counter measures about the same, whether I am sleeping or using the stair stepper at a rate of 3 miles in 30 minutes."
3,Fitwatch,"Sharp color, nice size, but tough to monitor heart rate unless you stop your cardio workout."
1,HATE IT,"I was attracted to this watch because of the lack of chest strap...but there's a reason REAL heart rate monitors have a chest strap- because they WORK. This monitor works fine when you're standing still. But if you actually want to use it to work out, think again. It's really annoying to have to press and hold down the sensors with two fingers to get a read and it barely reads when you're moving. By the time it reads, you've already stopped your work out. Also, there's no way for it to do a calorie count because it's not monitoring your heart rate during your work out. It must ""guess"" based on the 1 or 2 readings you're able to get at some point during your work out...far from accurate.Trust me, go for the strap. I'm sure you get used to it after a day or two. Wish me luck on returning this one."
1,Did Not Work From the Start,"I recently bought this product for a gift, however from the moment we opened it up it was problematic. It would completely turn off in the middle of use and have to be reset again, this happen at least 20 times in the course of 2 days. We ended up returning this product to Amazon, and it couldn't have been easier. Amazon took it back quickly and with no problems, that was really the only bright spot in this pruchase. We may have just had a defective one, but we did end up going with a watch from Polar, and I give that one 5/5 stars. It was much easier to use with absolutely no problems."
4,Love It!!!!,This watch is lightweight and stylish enough for me to wear everyday. I use the heart rate feature all the time. Sometimes blowing on your fingers helps the readout if it is colder outside or your fingers are cold. The only question I have about the watch is if the calories burned section/screen has a decimal in the readout. I get very high calories burned for moderate exertion. I love the blue backlit feature for nighttime use. I would definitely buy this watch again or as a gift.
3,good while it lasted,"this watch kept dying on me. i changed the battery once, and it died about a month later on me. i'm not sure if the new battery was actually an ""old"" battery or whether there's a flaw in the watch. anyway probably won't buy the same item again. i did like how well it worked while i still had it! and it did last at least a year."
2,"Could Be Good, But Not For Me","All arrived fine and seemed to be all it promised. But it doesn't pick up the senses from my fingertips so is completely useless to me. I plan to send it back and get a wireless Polar model.For the record, I also have an iPod speaker unit that doesn't respond to my fingers. So could be me. Or perhaps isn't for people with smaller fingers."
2,Hard to use,I found this hard to use. Even my trainer at the gym tried setting this up for me and said it was more difficult than others out there. I wish I had bought a different brand that was more automatic.
3,Too many features,I wanted a simple heart rate monitor. There are too many modes and it is difficult to switch between them. I never know if I am in the hart rate mode. The small buttons do not work as well as I would like. When you do get to the correct mode it does work fine.
2,Reebok fitwatch sucks,I loved the idea and purchased it. It was very difficult to hold down the buttons that would not hold down very well. I was very disappointed in the item and am sending it back.
3,Hit and Miss,"I bought this Monitor Watch because a friend has a similar one. My friends is a bit larger and the buttons are bigger. This one only works intermittently. I'm not completely sure why, but I think because the buttons are so small the fingers must be positioned perfectly. Also, usually after about 1 hour of hiking or running it works better. I may return it for a new one, maybe it's just defective."
4,Good Produce,"I like that this does not require a strap. The only annoying this is that you have to hold your hand our the sensors for it to measure your heart rate, rather than automatically calculating it. But, it has a calorie counter and other cool features. Generally, it does what I want it to."
3,Reebok Fitwatch,The heart rate monitor portion of the watch is complicated. I have had difficulty getting a heart rate reading while I am exercising.
1,Not accurate - Don't buy,I bought this watch for my wife - she wanted a heart rate monitor watch with calorie counter. The watch was light and easy to use but the heart rate monitor was 20 - 30 beats per minute above what her heart rate really was. It was also hard to tell if the calorie counter was accurate since it would continue to count calories after you took the watch off. I would not advise anybody to get this watch.
4,Good Product,"Reebok Fitwatch 10S Strapless Heart Rate Monitor Watch (Blue)Works quite well, but the watchband could have been designed a bit better."
4,Good purchase,"I purchased this item to keep track of my heart rate while I exercise during my pregnancy. It works generally well. Occasionally I don't get a reading, but overall I am happy with the purchase."
1,Reebok Fitwatch,"Watch has great fit and finish. The watch measures heart rate well when you are NOT exercising hard, but is not consistent when you are moving quickly. Obviously that is the time when I want it to work... Additionally, it will not read heart rate wit dry skin underneath the watch. If you are not sweating, you must moisten the skin under the watch to make good contact. This is most inconvenient. Overall, the idea is great, but not carried out well. I would not recommend the watch to anyone who is looking for consistent, simple heart rate monitoring."
3,looks arent everything!,"It's very attractive. Not too bulky. The display is easy to read. There are still a few features I cant figure out. The main problem is it's inconsistancey reading heart rate. When your running, tired and out of breath. I just want it to do it's job. I don't want to hold the buttons down for the required amount of time only to have to let go and try again. Even when it finally does read it not always accurate. I don'r mean by 1, 2 or even 10. It's read 104 and retaken 10 seconds later and read 168. I'm not sure what to do but live with it now."
1,Did not work,"I was very disappointed by the performance of this watch and ended up returning it. The heart rate function simply would not work consistently. Most of the time, I would press the button and nothing would happen. When I did get a reading it would be wildly different than the reading on my stationary bike (which I consider to be quite accurate.) Others seemed to have similar problems with this watch and I should have heeded their advice! On a positive note, Amazon was great about letting me return it and I got a complete refund. Buy this watch with extreme caution!"
2,Bulky and unreliable,"I purchased this watch to monitor my aerobics workouts. It worked fine testing it prior to my work out. I checked my heart rate between each song to make sure I was working in my 'target zone'. The first 3 checks read fine, then it stopped working completely. The heartrate just wouldn't register. I tried wetting my fingers, drying my fingers, nothing. When I got home after the workout, it worked fine.It's also very thick and hits my wristbone uncomfortably."
2,"Heart Rate Monitor Watch Featuring 3 ""Not-So-Easy"" Steps","When starting to exercise after recovering from heart surgery, keeping tract of your heart rate is important. This watch seemed like a great way to monitor how hard your heart is working. Just put the watch on, press two sensors and you have the answer. Great premise, but it doesn't always work! Your fingers may be too dry, your skin too oily, the watch too loose, your pressure too weak or too strong, etc.. You may find yourself pressing without results so many times that it's frustrating - a great way to increase your heart rate without even trying. Sometimes it might be easier just counting out the beats yourself."
2,Did not work in the pool,I was unhappy with this. I reset itself twice in the first couple of weeks requiring me to renter date and time. It did not work while swimming laps. The band was hard to get on and off.
2,"Ok as a watch, bad as a HRM","This watch works fine and all the other features seem to be great, but as a HRM it simply doesn't do the job I need! In one 45 minute session on an elliptical it thought I burned 700+ calories, while the machine and another heart rate monitor both read as me burning about 250. I got this for Christmas otherwise I would have been shopping for a HRM with a chest strap like the Polar F6, which I will probably buy soon."
1,Great music but appallingly bad sound,It's difficult to believe that a session recorded in 1947 could have sound this bad. It's sounds worse than something from 1920 lifted off someone's old acetates. There are a lot of great Bunk Johnson recordings and no reason to buy this one unless you are a compulsive completist.
5,Simply one of the best flower painting books ever published,"If you really want to learn about flower painting, This is one book you simply cannot do without ! This book REALLY teaches you the basics step-by-step. It is beautifully illustrated and will give you the necessary knowledge in learning how to paint flowers with the help of different artists. There are very few books on flower painting that will give you this much demonstration, tips & techniques plus beautifully painted flowers that are painted so realistically that you can almost smell them."
4,not for beginners,"This book is for someone who has already gotten a grounding in watercolor. That was not my situation when I bought it, and that plus the misleading writeup is why I gave it four stars rather than five. It does have a lot of nice illustrations and plenty of information on tricky stuff like how to underpaint shadows, make realistic-looking dewdrops, etc. Once I get some experience in the basics of watercolor painting it will be a great resource."
4,A Learning Experience.,"From the very start Mr. Meinig teaches the reader, even learned ones, a new way of seeing how America was settled. His perspctive includes all members of the societies which he covers. While the book is very factual, it is written in such a way that it opens ones imagination. By using a geographical viewpoint, you are able to 'see' the topics he covers. My only criticism is that he does not reference his quotes in a traditional manner, though a quick perusal of the bibliography shows they are valid. Once you realize that he includes an extensive list of sources, this concern disappears. I recommend this to anyone who wants to discover more about the discovery of our land."
3,Good but could be better,Overall its ok. The author introduces alot of theroy and analyzes things in an almost mathmatical way. He also draws conclusions without alot of specific evidence for them. The book has some very good information however and its presented in an orderly fashion. You just have to sift through all the useless theory to get what you need.
2,unfortunate,"I came to this recording with high expectations because of Godowsky's reputation as ""a Buddha among pianists."" The recordings were a terrible let-down for two reasons.First is that the sound quality is extremely poor, making the music difficult to listen to (and this from an avid collector of historical recordings!). The hiss/buzz is extremely loud and the tone flat and colorless.The second is that the playing just doesn't live up to Godowsky's reputation. He always did terribly in a recording studio, and never seemed to do justice to what he was capable of in live or private performance. Godowsky himself was aware of this shortcoming; he apparently wrote in a letter shortly before his death, ""Do not judge me by my recordings!""I wouldn't recommend buying this recording unless you have a particular interest in Godowsky or are trying to compile the whole Philip's set."
2,UNBELIEVEABLE PRICE FOR AN IMPORT TITLE!!,"I just purchased this 3 cd boxed set from a local record store. I had my doubts at first about these cds being fakes or illegally made but let me tell you. Theyre the real thing!! All 3 cds have the original booklets and paperwork. The disc art work is all the same except for ""Cowboys From Hell"", which is different from the american one. The catalog numbers are different from the american versions and each disc is labeled with a logo that says, ""manufactured and distributed by Warner Music Australia"" which identifies it as an Import, which is cool. Overall, for Under $25 bucks, you cant get a better deal on these three albums. At $15 each, it would cost you $45 for these three albums if bought separately. Bottom line. Buy this boxed set, you'll own 3 authentic Import Pantera cds and have $20 bucks left to buy me something!!"
2,Another one bites the gunpowder,"Again we see an 'Action Encyclopedia' from Bensn, which turns out to be little more than exerpts of Paladin Press books, including quite a few titles from Ragnar re-hashed in what is generally a waste of your time. More B.S. explosives, including the 'improved C-4' formula. Interesting reading for those who aren't serious 'men of action.', but a waste of time for the rest of us."
3,Not what I was hoping for.,"I was hoping for alot more detail. Some things were covered adequately however other topics were barely covered. Either way, both volumes are a good read for the adventurer, but just know that certain books shouldn't be cut down."
3,not what i expected but more detailed than the first VOLUME,"THIS BOOK IS LITTLE MORE THAN A STORY BOOK AND A HISTORY BOOK WHAT LITTLE INFO IT HAS IS FAR TO VAGUE TO BE USEFUL EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE IMPROVED C4 FORMULA .THERE'S NOTHING ANY ""MAN OF ACTION""WOULDNT ALREADY KNOW, I WOULD GIVE IT ANOTHER STAR IF IT WAS CHEAPER."
3,Mac Users: CD-Rom is OS9/Classic only!,"I was excited to receive this book and the CD-ROM with business plan templates - until I actually tried to the use the CD-ROM in my computer. If you're a Mac user - like many filmmakers - it only works with Classic, i.e. OS 9.2 or lower. If you're on a newer Mac running OS10.2, it may not have Classic on it. I spoke to tech support rep at the publisher Elsevier who ran through a well rehearsed litany of excuses: ""every Mac has OS 9 on it... Blame it on Mac. They made OSX before they did due diligence on the [publishing] industry... It takes four years to develop a program... We have 10,000 titles."" Now I'll have to find an OS9 disc and load it on, bit of a hassle."
4,Filmmakers and Financing Covers the Bases,"When settling down with my attorney about creating a business structure and investment documents for my first indie feature film he asked me if I had a business plan. My answer was, ""I haven't even thought about it."" Movie production is a business and should be treated as such. A business plan is a roadmap for how you plan to create a movie that can return a profit to the investors. I've written several business plans for businesses outside of the entertainment industry, but show business has it's own set of performance metrics that Louise covers well in her book. Investors look for and expect a business plan, especially those who have not invested in films before. The CD is a bit disappointing in content. It would be nice to have several premade templates to get the ball rolling."
4,Business Plan...,I have been working on a business plan for well over a year. I was so frustrated. My business partner suggested we buy this book. We ended up finishing the plan in a few weeks... Her book is amazingly helpful. I look forward to updating this review once we receive the funds!! Thanks for writing it and helping fellow filmmakers...
4,A great place to start for the indie filmmaker,"A great place to start for the indie filmmakerI am an independent filmmaker. I also run a film festival called The Gangrene Film Festival. I have striven for years to get a feature length project off the ground. The task is daunting and scary for someone who doesn't know the business.Filmmakers & Financing is an excellent place to start. I found this book highly useful. The book teaches in a simple, step-by-step format how to put together an excellent business plan for your film. It teaches what investors are looking for in a business plan and how you can get their ear with a professional, well-researched prospectus.It is not enough just to be an artist and to be passionate about your craft as a filmmaker; these things won't get you financial backing. You must explore the market and analyze your future film's possible place in that market. This book teaches you how to do just that.Hope this helps.-Craig Nybo, co-author of [ ... ]"
5,useful,"I'm very happy with that book, which is specialized but quite acessible for people with a genuine interst in the matter and who want to understand the how and why. It is concise and complete, and raises your interest."
3,A great addition to an indie filmmaker's library!,"As a student of Film, Television and Digital Media Entertainment at UCLA, I found this book to be very valuable in understanding the process of financing your own projects."
4,Best Of compilation,A great collection of Ruby Turner's best songs. However Stay With Me Baby (my fave song) is not on the album. I was disappointed with this. Pleased with the album overall.
3,"Chords are Great, Selection Not Impressive","Having already purchased ""The Best Blues Fake Book"" and several others, I was prepared to be impressed with this but was not. Real jazz buffs aren't going to be satisfied with the selection in the book. The chords are exactly right and that's a comfort, but the book shouldn't be touting itself as early Jazz when it's missing many of the standards of the earliest days of jazz. I had expected to see more from the early Armstrong days, like ""Cake Walkin' Babies."" On the plus side it does have ""Body and Soul,"" ""All of Me,"" and ""Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You.""As another reviewer noted, the chords are excellent, so if you're looking for the genuine article to improvise over, this is it. It's just a shame that the book leaned more toward Glenn Miller and less toward the earlier dixieland songs."
1,Ragtime & Early Jazz,"Warning to traditional jazz musicians. Though the tunes included in this collection fill the bill, the chords given are modern interpretations, totlally unsuitable for traditional jazz performers - EVERY (yes every) major chord has been substituted with a major seventh chord (as in ""Color My World""). The editor considers this a convention.I would suggest Hal-Leonard clarify this ""convention"" on the cover ASAP.There are already enough distractions on a bandstand without adding this."
5,"Inspirational, at the very least","I am at somewhat of a loss when reviewing this movie. It was the 2nd video I ever saw as a drummer. I was of course blown away by Bruford's dexterity on the instrument; blazing around the toms and simmons pads with the greatest of ease, never breaking a sweat. The other interesting thing about what I saw that is still a Bruford trademark, is the really peculiar way he sets up his drums. The way he mixes his electronic pads in with the acoustic drums, the roto-toms, the log drum, etc. It's not so much what is in his arsenal, but where and how he sets it up. I would have a time tackling his drumset, but Bruford makes if work. Effortless work, buy this movie."
2,Bruford & The Beat,"Good sound,lousy video quality duplication crappy at most.Center video line shown pretty much through out,at least on this 1 anyway and it's to bad too,because i really like the artist and his playing."
2,Didn't download,"I can't review this book because only one percent of it downloaded to my device. In fact, the same thing happened with three other downloads that same day, but I can't make another attempt becausd Amazon says that, according to their records, I've already downloaded it."
4,Is it Me?,"A friend recommended this book to me after I explained how much fun I was having after leaving work in DC, returning to Minnesota, playing with my kids, joining a mountain biking team and genuinely enjoying my unemplyed status for 9 months. She said it was a philosophical book.I spent the entire book trying to figure out why she thought of this book after I got through telling her how great my life was at the present. Mr. Polly clearly was not living a great life and always seemed to be on the wrong side of circumstance. It wasn't until the very end of the book that I realized the context my friend applied to my happenings.The book, for it's strange accents and period vocabulary, was as riveting as any Grisham or Baldacci novel. I don't really know why - but it was. And the last few pages makes one think very hard about the meaning of life, which even for an unemployed child-at-heart, is important to do now and again."
4,Tragic and comic and good,"The History of Mr. Polly is less known than Well's sci-fi classics and it is a different kind of a book too. It pictures a tragicomic story of an unusual character - Mr. Polly. The story is quite funny, but there underneath is a deeper meaning. There are people like Mr. Polly around us. They drift through their lives wondering if it is them or the environment that determined their fate.Although Wells and Dostoyevsky are extremely diferent, Mr. Polly in a certain way reminds me of some Dostoyevsky's characters.Very interesting book. Very well read by Clive Swift.If you like this book, I can recommend you to read both Invisible Man by Wells and Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky."
3,PRETTY GOOD!!!,"For a B-movie, this didn't disappoint me. Larry Drake plays a stalker and does it well. This is one to sit back and relax to, but watch your back..."
2,"Brilliant look at post-punk, but buy the UK version","Heard about this book in a review in Wire magazine, and my girlfriend kindly ordered the book from amazon.co.uk for me for Christmas. When the book came to the States it had lost about 200 pages and any sections on music that wasn't ""as popular"" on this side of the ocean. In the day of global information and the lowering of borders, this is just absurd. Buy the full book (a 5 star proposition), it's worth it."
3,Overly academic,"It's well-researched and well-written - that much we can all agree on - but I think the writing is a bit dry. This book has been sitting next to ""Please Kill Me: the uncensored oral history of punk"" on my bookshelf for nearly a year, and I can only read a chapter or two at a time. I've tried reading ""Rip it Up"" several times, but it lacks the energy and compulsive readability of its shelf-mate. I sorely want to read this book, but my mind starts wandering every time I start reading it...it feels kind of like homework. It just lacks the energy of the music it describes."
4,Theory-Mongers of a different sort...,"I cannot say enough positive things about Rip It Up and Simon Reynolds (every review seems to repeat), so ill stop there.Onto the bad...Reynolds, especially in the first part of two, draws up an interesting confluence of events, influences, and critical theory that explains away all the mystique and creation myth around some of post punk greatest heroes.How many times must we hear of the ""blues"" parties and dub influence, in which intrepid white adventures venture into the primarily black neighborhoods in search of the deep bass?How many times must the same influences of Fluxus (Neo-Dada), Situationism, ""play,"" and Gramsci be mentioned?How many times must the entire narrative be fit into the wider narrative of Thatcher's take-over and the movement from left to right?The book's saving grace is by far the second part, which feels so incredibly refreshing by the time you've made it through the first part. Thank god for synth pop, ska, and the new romantics."
3,A lackluster mystery but great characters,"Let's be frank: this really isn't much of a mystery. By the middle of the book, the reader has figured out everything the heroine is too thick-headed to investigate and has already picked out the murderer. In fact, the denseness of the heroine can become really annoying in the middle of the book.However, this is the first of four books with the same characters and a running subplot between these characters. And really, the characters make up for the lack of mystery in this mystery.As for romance, there really isn't much. Read this one really for the characters that will show up in the following books"
3,It works...,"We use this on our two pugs when they get itchy, it certainly seems to work for the short-term relief of mild itching, although you do have to work it into their fur in order for it to get down to the skin. I am doubtful how well this would work on a long-haired dog. The relief seems to come pretty quickly, and lasts at least an hour or so."
4,Good spray,I bought this as my min pin (dog) gets rashes from various allergies. This works well at getting rid of the rash as well as soothing for my dog. She can be scratching/licking then I spray it and she's back to normal. Only complaint is it don't spray very well; comes out in a solid stream. I just rub it on and it's okay.
4,Good Stuff-- Works on English Setters,"I was in a bit of despair when it came to my bird dogs scratching and biting at their backs. This warm winter seems to have kept the allergens active.We had gone through antihistamines, anti-inflammatories and fish oil without out success. However this seems to really work in a short period of time. A brief spray when they start chewing on their skin and the behavior stops. In addition it is not sedating.I just ordering my second bottle now to stock up for the summer round."
3,I am not sure about this product,I bought this spray for one of my dogs. He has been scratching his neck for a really long time. I've checked his neck and there are no blisters or irritations. I sprayed it on the area he keeps scraching and nothing happened. He probably needs something else.
5,i absolutly love this product,thanks to alot of stress my cat began losing hair and scratching himself alot because of dry skin from stress. started using this product and within days i noticed a difference. my cat seems so much more active and the sores are disapearing. and hair is coming back slowly . even presciption sprays didnt give me this results. i highly recomend it. i just bought 2 more bottles tonight.
3,Very temporary for our needs,We don't know what is wrong with our dog right now but have tried everything. He's still suffering. This gives very temporary relief so it leads me to believe it would work on less serious skin issues though.
1,didn't get what was expected,"good product but didn't get the 4 oz as advertized, the bottle wasn't even half full, was just about 2 oz of product in the bottle, for 10 bucks isn't worth the trouble or money to send back, the product left in the bottle did seam to work."
1,Didn't work,"Didn't work. The only thing that did, and my dog has major allergies, is Band Aid spray calamine lotion. Dog on steroids = sad but we've tried everything. At least this gives him some relief."
3,too soon to tell,"received item as promised, packed well and prompt. Not sure if item is working on my dogs hot spots yet."
5,Great album,"I'm a big fan of late 70s/early 80s New Wave/Modern Rock music. But sometimes I find a hole in my memory when I try to remember which artists and songs to pick up. And even using the ""top hits of the 80s"" compiliations some great gems remain hidden. That's why I'm very glad that someone posted the Youtube video of Pete's ""Come As You Are"" to remind me how much I like this guy.Great album. Great flashback to a sound that would be hot if it was just coming out today."
5,WARNING! DON'T BELIEVE THE 1-STAR LIERS!,"FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO COMMENT THAT ALL THE JUNK ABOUT THE SCARE-TACTIC IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN, THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH. I ALWAYS WAS THE TOP BEST IN ALL MY SCHOOLS AND GRADUATED FROM HARVARD, I CAN RECOGNIZE GREAT WRITING AND THIS IS VERY VERY GOOD. I HAVE READ BETTER, BUT NOT MUCH. TO ANYONE WHO DISAGREES READ REVELATIONS. THE BOOK IS TRUE. SORRY TO SAY THAT ABOUT YOU AND I WANTED TO EXPRESS THE FACT ABOUT THE BOOK THAT IT IS NOT IN ANY WAY FALSE, EXCEPT THE MADE-UP CHARACTERS. LOVE IN CHRIST. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU HEAVEN."
2,The only thing destroyed is the quality of the series.,"I think customer demand, ironically, is wrecking this series. It's great that it's so popular and that people are reading about the things of God. But because everybody demands that the authors write the next book right away, they don't have the time to put together a quality novel. Even John Grisham only writes one book a year. Trying to do two a year, plus the kids books, is dumbing down the writing. The dialogue is mostly inane banter, and there's only a few scenes with compelling action or writing (the locust plague, or the witnesses killing people). So much of the rest feels like filler. Tell the authors to ignore the crowds and take their time. I'd rather have one quality book a year than two books that are lame."
4,Solid Read,"I really enjoyed the entire Left Behind series. While the reader must remember that it is fiction, the story is fast paced. It is a quick read and really draws you in. The series is definitely a worthwhile read and will keep you wanting to keep reading the series. I would definitely recommend it for a light summer read."
4,Great Addition to Series,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It made me feel sorry for the people who are left behind. I also have to admit that I'm anxious for the series to progress. Seems to be faltering a bit??
1,What a piece of junk!,"A cliche-ridden piece of evangelical hog-wash. The only people who could love this series are a truly frightening cult of christen's who thankfully do not represent the whole. Even if I could buy into the authors' theology, I would rather join the bad guys--locusts and all--than spend time with the stupefyingly dull, self-righteous protagonists. The writing is soooo bad, all I wanted to do is get to through last page so I could throw the book away."
5,This entire series has captivated me!,"From the very first volume LEFT BEHIND to APOLLYON, I have been captivated! I have never been much of a reader, and the book of Revelation has been a mystery that has intrigued me. But now I find myself going back and looking at with a different understanding because of the writing of Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins and the Left Behind series. This is a first rate series, and I look forward to reading the rest of them as they come out."
4,Good Fiction?,"This book continues the saga and by now the characters have become very soap opera-ish. If you've read the previous books in the series, part of the draw is to find out what has happened to those left behind. You won't be dissappointed either as their are more twists and turns to this preachy soap. The intrigue is there but something is lacking or maybe it is that the formula has been streched too thin and this information could have been condensed into less than five books. The suspense will still keep your attention but it won't keep you riveted like before. The messaage permeates the book and you cannot escape the inevitable question concerning your own personal salvation. An easy read that entertains the mind and soul, for believers mostly but fun reading for those who still walk the tightrope."
4,Starts out a little slow but pulls you in quickly,"Appolyon by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins is the fourth book in a great series about the endtimes. Bible-based the characters are discovering what it's like to live through the 7-year tribulation and God's wrath. They become fugitives against a one-world government as the world goes through the Fifth Trumpet Judgement-a plague. A great read, Appolyon is heart-wrenching, romantic, full of adventure and highly recommended! Don't miss the other books in this series!"
2,NOT BAD. BUT TREMENDOUSLY OVERRATED,"THE BOOK STARTED OUT BETTER THAN ANY OF THE PREVIOUS ""LEFT BEHIND"" BOOKS, AND ALMOST MADE ME EAT MY WORDS ABOUT THE SERIES. I THOUGHT THE GATHERING OF THE WITNESSE WAS AWESOME BUT IT WAS ALL DOWNHILL FROM THERE. I DON'T SEE WHY PEOPLE ARE SO OBSSESED WITH THIS SERIES. I MEAN COME ON DOESN'T IT SEEM A LITTLE HOOKEY TO YOU, LIKE THE ANTICHRIST IS GOING TO BE SO CONCERNED OVER A LITTLE PASTOR NAMED BRUSE BARNES ENOUGH TO KILL HIM. I'M SORRY IF YOU GUYS THINK THIS IS A THRILL TRY PERETTI HE'S A ROLLERCOASTER!"
2,Too Slow!,"I've read all the books in the Left Behind series. The 1st (Left Behind) was excellent and I couldn't wait to read the next 2 (Tribulation Force and Nicolae). They seemed to slow down a bit, but still kept me interested. Soul Harvest and now Apollyon have been entirely too slow and the characters don't really interest me anymore. The dialogue seems forced and stiff. La Haye and Jenkins need to slow down themselves and take the time necessary to generate a good product - a book that is not slow-moving, but has more action and substance. This subject matter is too important! This series still has great potential and I'll probably continue to read the books. I'll just be sure to check them out from the library next time!"
5,Excellent,"This is the best book in the series so far. It left me in complete suspence. The best part was when the Tribulation Force was escaping from Jerusleum and Buck fell out. Another great part was when the locust from the Destroyer was attacking and only the ""sealed ones"" were spared. Nicolae is always trying to turn everything in his favor and lie about it. For example, when the power is reduced around the world do to the loss of 1/3 light, Nicolae puts on a fur coat to make it appear it is cold where he is even though he has heat there. It is good even to then end when it seems Chloe's unborn baby may die, but it lives This book is a definate read for anybody."
1,"Brain candy, not evangelistic literature.","Are there really non-Christians who are becoming Christians because of these books? The vast majority of reviews on this site are Christians who just say that non-Christians should read them. I have yet to see an actual review by someone who didn't believe in God, read these books, and decided to believe in Jesus. And then I have to question what kind of vision of Christianity they are converting to. These books might be entertaining distractions for Christians, but if you want to give non-Christians real solid material, try Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewis."
3,Too Slow,Okay they took a story and decided to drag it out through more than 10 books making each one long without too much action. You keep reading cause you want to know how the story will end. But it isn't fast or easy reading because the story is told too slow.
3,OK at best. Grossly over-rated.,"I've read all five in the series. ""Left Behind"" is still the best, but even that book rates no better than a four. I found myself skipping sections to get to the point. This series is not nearly as scriptural as the bulk of the reviews suggest. A good read for the kids. But for serious reading, I suggest Michael O'Brien's ""The Eclipse of the Sun""."
5,BEATS ALL THE OTHER BOOKS WITH ITS LITERAL ART,I thought this installment was the best yet. I managed to polish it off in less than two days. I am upset now because I have to wait until till summer until I can read the next book!!! I love this series. It is easy to read and fun!
1,The Emperor has no clothes.,"First of all I am an evangelical Christian so I have no particular axe to grind with these books from a spiritual perspective. In fact the biblical scholorship here is interesting and is the sole redeeming factor.The fact is that these guys are completely incapable of writing fiction. I'll bet there are Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries that are more well written than these books and Apollyon is the bottom of the barrel.It's really an embarrasment.It's been my experience as a Christian that we always seem to close ranks behind christian anything and nobody ever tells the truth about how they feel about things lest we be judged by other christians for having a heretical perspective.Sorry,I refuse to play.The emperor has no clothes.THESE BOOKS STINK! The authors are milking these books for all they are worth and have eliminated quality completely."
4,Keep 'em coming,"These Left Behind books have the most compelling Christian characters since Wilson Lindberg in The Triumph and the Glory. The plot lines could be better, I wish there would be a little more focus on Biblical events instead of the personal lives of Buck and Rayford and the rest though. Even memorable characters like them should take second place to the apocolyptic events of Revelation."
2,Nancy Drew meets the Apocolypse,"I read all these books(five of them) in a five day period.Easy to race through, a third grader could understand them. Large type and juvenile writing style makes for easy reading. The series had been recommended and I have to admit I got hooked, but kept laughing out loud at the redundancies and the style that reminded me so much of some of the first reading I did...Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys style. My opinion, when asked, is that these writers are trying to get their message across to folks at all educational levels...point being they are working on the religious side as opposed to the literary side. Good poolside reading, they can be thrown away without your having spent a fortune on them."
4,If you liked this one . . .,"While I found much to like in this series (and I've read them all so far), anyone who thinks this book is provocative should test their nerve on the most awesome ""end-time"" book of them all--Glenn Kleier's ""The Last Day."" You can't read it without coming away with a most profound feeling that you've just been in the presence of a true divinity and a divine revelation. An extraordinarly impressive story."
2,Not bad but not thier best.,"I feel that the authors are too influenced by marketing now. In the beginning the book gave me the feeling that they were honestly trying to tell a story. It was an honest hard worked effort. Now it seems that the motive to me is making sure that thier bank account is full. In other words the books need more time to develop and they are taking much too long to tell the story. I do like the fact that the books may be druming up interest in Christ and that some may actually get the message, after all Paul said as long as they preach Christ."
4,An Excellent Book,"This is a very good, very accurate book (in terms of the Bible vs this book). While I don't criticize the book for anything it has in it, I'm criticizing it because I thought the other ones were better. The one that had me hanging by the seat of my pants was Nicolae. But still, this is an excellent book that I recommend that you read."
3,Not realistic,"This is just not credible enough in the way it's developed to create the wrath of God tension and fear you expect in a judgment day thriller. A far, far more exciting and thrilling read is THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier. If you want your hair to stand on end, read LAST DAY and see what a real End Time experience is."
5,Best of the Series! Each one brings me closer to God.,"This was the most exciting one yet! Maybe I differ from some of the other readers. Maybe it's because I have the money to purchase the books. But I want the series to go on and on. One reader suggested that none of the charactors ever suffer. What about the Captain's loss of his wife. What about the loss of Bruce in the first book. What about the fact that they all share a tiny little apt. And this book has even more losses! The story has to maintain its core charactors. Lets face it, the books are pretty close on how scary it will be, but we all still want our charactors to last, otherwise, how would we continue to relate. I say, excellent job to the authors. And I bet if anyone checked into it, they would find that people are being saved through these series of books. I would say that's a good use of our money for the cause of Christ!! And as a believer, this series only serves to bring me closer to Christ and want to serve him more!"
3,Awesome book!,"This riveting piece of prophetic fiction keeps the reader longing for more at the turn of each page. The fifth of the left behind series, Apollyon stands as a strong affirmation of how much God wants to get our attention's as a people. Giving us believers, the strength and joy to go on, no matter the adversity. Something the Tribulation force has kept in mind, and will continue to do so until the day of the Glorious Appearing. Even though the demon attack could've been detailed and described more,the book really isn't so bad. So believers out there - shout! We've got the victory. Amen? Amen!"
4,Still good....,"I thought this book was as good as the rest. After a bit, I got used to skipping over recaps and parts of the story that I had heard before. Being a non-Christian, I also skip over lots of the sermon parts written by Tsion. I am reading it for the excitement- and to see how the authors interpret what is in the Bible and how it unfolds on Earth. After 6 books it hasn't changed my religous views- but it has taught me what Christians believe.One thing I really like about this series is that it seemd very real-because they use real places, newspapers, etc. Once, flying into Dulles airport I thought about the fact that it was supposed to be destroyed. The books stay with you and I have to remind myself sometimes that they aren't real (and probably never will be, in my opinion)Overall- a very good series."
2,apollyon,"this book was too long and had barely anything good in it, the book mostly consists of speeches by nicolae and it was boring. the only good psrt of the book lasted only 25 pages."
2,Hasn't this gone on long enough....,"I've been a big fan of this series, but I am reaching the saturation point. This story just NEVER seems to take any significant steps. Those of us who continue to buy these books are shelling out a lot of money for a story that could have been easily told in one or two editions. I suggest that the erstwhile authors may be guilty of a deadly sin: GREED. After all, the more volumes there are, the more royalties come their way. I say BRING THIS STORY TO AN END."
3,Good but not the best,"This is a vary great book and I am going crazy waiting for the next book in the series, but it was not as good as the previous four. It didn't take off until the last 80 pages. But, it is still worth reading."
2,"Weak entry in Left Behind series, series begins to tire.","Although I loved the previous titles this entry is beginning to tire me out. Rather than being Left Behind after the Rapture of the Church being a bad thing reading about these characters leads me to believe that the Tribulation period would not be half bad! None of the core characters EVER suffer any permanent calamities. The series itself is beginning to remind me of the old Star Trek re-runs on T.V. All the main characters are surrounded by secondary ones that are expendable. The main characters are never in any real danger and we know it. Maybe some tragedy to a main character once in a while could add some drama, even Steele's new wife turned out to be perfect. Not that we ever doubted her for a minute.(LOL) More surprises occuring to the core group could add some REAL fear for them as characters. Lets hope we see some actual TRIBULATION in the next chapters."
5,A very thought provoking book.,I really liked this book. It really makes you think about how precious this time is that we have before Christ comes.
3,"It's a slower read, but worth the effort","Of the entire series, Apollyon has proven the longest read. While Carpathia's public addresses seem too wordy, the story is well-written and interesting."
3,Where's the beef?,"This is Judgment Day lite. All this ""Left Behind"" stuff Left me bored. End of the World literature should be brash and scary and powerfully challenging, and this is none of that. The very finest Judgement Day novel I've ever read is by far a book called THE LAST DAY by Glen Kleier (sp?). After that heart-stopper, all these other attempts seem so luke-warm. There is so much more depth to mine from this theme, and the Left Behind books barely scratch the surface."
3,"Not as good as the rest of the series, Apollyon dragged.","I've read the entire series to date. LaHaye and Jenkins have made Revelation much clearer: as a Christian who tends to put off until tomorrow what I should be doing today, I've found the series has really brought the concept of now, not later, into focus. However, Apollyon seemed unnecessary, at least as an entire book. Its content could have been boiled down into 1/2 the number of pages and included in the next one. I question why the authors wrote a book that dragged so, wasted so much time on Hattie's health, etc. Did they feel they had to get out another in the series to keep their publishers and public satisfied? If so, this one didn't make the cut. Generally not up to their usual best! If I were a reader picking up this book first instead of Left Behind, I probably wouldn't buy the rest of the series."
5,The best yet!!!,"This is the best out of all the Left Behind books!!!! I have always loved them all but this one beats them all. The book centers on how the days are getting worse and the non-Christians are starting to suffer even more. There are more plauges, there is the big meeting of all the Christians in Israel(with a surprise drop in guest!), and the tention is definately getting worse between Nicoale and the Christian(especially Buck and Rayford!). These books are great wittnessing tools or just a good Christian fiction book. A deffinate must read for those who are looking for Christ!"
4,Affirmation for the elect and the willing...,"For those already in the choir, the ""Left Behind Series"" are an affirmation of hope. For those who are on the fence, these books may nudge you in either direction. For those who have no hope in a moral ascendancy over their actions that is redemptive, this series may not persuade. For myself, I found ""Transfer-the end of the beginning"" by Jerry Furland a much more credible vision of the future. For those not already in the choir, perhaps ""Transfer"" is the best introduction to the future as it most likely will unfold."
2,"In all fairness, even a devoted loyalist must see flaws.","Even a cursory analysis of the characterization and plot devices of this volume indicates a general decline in the overall qualitative effect of the series. Most readers are no longer gripped by the minutiae of the Israeli conflagration, nor are the impending catastrophes presented with plausibility or satisfactory allocation of pagination. Major events are dealt with in a summarily dismissive manner, and minor characters consume far too much dialogue space. A more credible reading of the eschatological importment would provide far more casualties and more attention to such details as food and water and other such life sustaining materiel. In short, the heavily perfunctory and homiletic approach of the authors prevents literary and theological appreciation from taking place to any major extent."
1,"stupid, stupid book","i wish i could have given it less than one star, but they don't allow that.poorly written, limited point of view, not even really written by tim lahaye. jenkins does all the work.i should have been reading harry potter instead."
2,There are much better endtime thrillers out there,"When you have a topic as rich with possibilities as this, readers should expect: #1 terrific writing, #2 strong characters, #3 chills, thrills and hair curling suspense. Unfortunately, the LEFT BEHIND series disappoints on all levels. This is very lightweight stuff, people, in my opinion. The very finest of all endtimes novels, without question, is the quintessential Judgment Day suspense thriller, THE LAST DAY (Glenn Kleier, 1998, Warner books). If you want to read a gripping, intelligent and thought stimulating drama that will alternately fascinate you, amuse you, scare the living bejeebies out of you, and keep your mind boggled till the wee hours, there is none better. LAST DAY is the ultimate Last Day experience, and if you haven't read it yet, you're in for a soul-quaking treat. Not a one of these LEFT BEHIND novels comes anywhere close"
1,Offensive trash.,"What is this book about? If you're a pregnant non-Christian, your baby will die. If you're a pregnant Christian, your baby will be just fine. That's what it all boils down to. Just like Soul Harvest said that the only role for women was to get pregnant or die, now Apollyon says that good girls have babies while bad girls lose them. Such drivel is hardly a charitable presentation of the Christian gospel."
1,Dangerous book,"Anything that influences people to accept Christianity because of fear that they have for some fictional event is dangerous. Books should free the mind and spirit, not chain it to a faith that rarely serves as more than a heavy anchor. This book is garbage"
4,suspense throughout...,This book continues in the same style of writing from Tim and Jerry. Switching between plots throughout the book puts the reader in such a state of suspense that you want to continue reading to see how it all pans out. I especially liked the part of the story where Buck and some of the Tribulation Force is trying to escape from the clutches of the Global Community Forces after the big meeting in Israel. I thought I was right smack in the thick of the action and felt myself egging them on to escape.Great read!
1,Horrible theology; scare-tactic evangelism,"These two authors have decided that the only way to push forth their biblically inaccurate pre-millenial, futurist viewpoint of Revelation is to make trashy ""novels"" which scare or turn-off seeking people and make like-minded Christians feel self-righteous. The cause of Christ has been stained thanks to these ""books"". And evangelism has been substituted for marketing and profit. Way to go Jenkins and LaHaye . . . at least they will have to answer for this when Christ comes again."
4,"A great read, hard to pull yourself out of the story line.","A great book for believers and non-believers alike. I enjoyed Appollyon better than I did Nicolae and Soul Harvest. I got the feeling with those two books that they were being written in a hurry. It is a great series overall, made more intriguing by the ability to tie it into the events that are occuring in the world at large. Is that not a point to ponder!!! These 2 authors seem to be working well together on a tough topic. I am anxiously looking forward to the next one."
5,It is the most captivating book that I have ever read.,"Apollyon is the best written book by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins since Left Behind. If it doesn't make you think of revelations and the end of the world nothing will. I have to keep reminding myself that this is a fictional book. If Tim LaHaye left these books only for the people ""Left Behind"" He would save a number of souls during the rapture. Bring on the movie!"
5,I could not put it down.,"I began reading the Left Behind Series just before Easter. Two weeks later I found myself waiting for the sixth book to be published! I have avoided Rapture and Tribulation books in the past. They were frightening to me. Somehow this series captured me and I find myself comforted by the truths revealed from the scriptures. I highly recommend this text-based, well-written series to anyone curious about the book of Revelation, the Rapture, or End Times. This is an A-One read."
3,"Books 1,2&3 fast paced so what happened?","I eagerly read the first 3 books within a couple of days and rushed out to get the fourth thinking this is the grand finale! How wrong could I be..... I now find out that the authors intend to stretch the story line to at least 12 books - is this the Christian thing to do? Both Harvest and Apollyon and no doubt the next book could have been done in one. I am constantly re-covering old ground in the new books that I read in the first three with a couple of very minor exceptions. I don't wish to buy hardback versions of books for a series that has now decided to never end. Until then I shall keep myself busy reading the multi-chaptered, multi-storied, very interesting book - The Bible - It has a lot more action!"
5,GREAT! GREAT! GREAT! GREAT! AND GREAT!,"I loved all of them. All of the novels in the series are well done. The writing isn't the greatest, but the story is well developed. I can't wait for the next one!********* I've discovered another author named, A.T. Nicholas. He wrote a novel called, THE FIST OF GOD. I recommend it while we wait for the next LaHaye and Jenkins book. It's well written, the characters are realistic, and the plot is great. it has some cool twists. There's some strong language, but it has a positive message."
3,Where's the beef?,"I agree with readers who find the ""Left Behind"" series somewhat lacking. These stories are fine as biblical supplements, if that's what you're looking for, but they are really not very strong as good fiction writing goes. If you want to read an endtime story with some real chills and thrills, let me suggest ""The Last Day"" or maybe even ""Day of Confession."" Kleier's ""The Last Day"" departs somewhat from a conventional biblical account of endtimes, however it's a far more challenging story, with a lot more twists, surprises and suspense. And the writing is much better than in ""Apollyon"" and ""Left Behind."""
4,"Great story, great message!","Only The Triumph and the Glory can hold a candle to Apollyon, the latest Left behind book. I couldn't put either of them down, they are magnificent stories of good fighting evil, and winning. Very inspirational and TRUE."
4,5 and counting....,This book shows how God still works miracles in the lives of his people. It shows the truths about believers and non-believers in a battle for eternity. I have enjoyed reading books 1-5 in this series and I plan to continue to #6 shortly.
1,Not up to par,"I agree with at least one reviewer (""a reader from USA""). Left Behind was great. Tribulation Force was mediocre. Nicolae and Soul Harvest were very good and exciting. Appolyon was pretty bad. The only interesting part of the book was the end and the interaction with the 2 witnesses. If I had to read one more page about how much Buck missed Chloe I was going to give up on the whole thing. Hattie is tiresome. In fact, Nicolae and the witnesses are the only interesting characters. I found myself being totally turned off by these totally predictable boring characters. The biblical prophecy and the excitement of the truth of the coming appearance of the Lord Jesus is what makes these books. Stick to that and maybe the next book will be readable. The margins are wide, the print is large and the filler is immense. The book could have been done in 100 pages."
1,AMAZON.COM WAKEUP! THERE ARE TEN (10) IDENTICAL REVIEWS!,"Pardon me. Haven't read Apollyon, but have been reviewing Amazon's Bestseller List and happened to check this one out. Noticed Amazon's QA/QC (quality assurance/quality control) seems to be lacking. There are ten (10) identical reviews; that sure slants the ratings thus the 1 Star for balance, will rate again after reading the book. AMAZON.COM needs to be a little more QA/QC!"
3,Not as good as LEFT BEHIND,"Left Behind was a great book. It got me into reading Scripture again, and radically changed my view of Jesus, God and my own faith. However, the following books do not have as many quotes from the Bible as Left Behind did. The whole ""romance"" between Buck and Chloe and Amanda and Rayford feels like a mere waiting time until we get more Scripture and food for thought. I would like to see more about the two Witnessess, Eli and Moishe, and less filler like Buck's search for Chloe in ""Soul Harvest"". If I wanted a love story, I could read it anywhere else (and it would probably have better character development). Give me more of the Witnesses, and more interpretation of Scripture, and less of the juvenile romance. Thank you."
2,"Passable fiction, with an outdated '70s prophecy angle","The ""Left Behind"" series has been somewhat entertaining so far. It's passable fiction, worth reading. But the theology the authors use in writing leaves a great deal to be desired. Most Christians who HAVEN'T studied the Bible in great detail lap this kind of stuff up, without realizing that the ""Rapture"" has been predicted (without any success so far) since the 1930s. Hal Lindsey may have made it a little more famous since the '70s, but it's still an outdated concept that you really won't find in the Bible...unless you look VERY hard, and mismatch a few texts to fit your outlook. ""Left Behind"" is little more than the ""Thief in the Night"" movies turned into books, with 21st century technology tucked in to make them contemporary. If you're expected all of this to happen someday, I'd suggest you starting truly studying the Bible, and plug back into reality...the rest of the church is waiting for you to return."
5,By far the best in the series,I have read all of the LEFT BEHIND books and feel that this is the best by far. It will leave you waiting for the next in the series. I am looking forward it reading the new one as soon as it comes out.
3,Much Better than Soul Harvest but still lacking,"This book was exciting and tied up some of the loose ends in the previous books. They also had fewer ""reality gaps"" or places where the reality of the book is against itself.Attention: Lahaye and JenkinsPlease please do your research on facts of disaster survival etc. It would make your story much more believable. Example: Buck COULD NOT FALL OUT OF A LEAR JET ON TAKE OFF AND SURVIVE! Do you have any idea how fast the plane would be going? It is difficult for non-Christians to accept your Biblical interpetation. Don't insult them with natural physical impossiblities!"
3,Pulp Fiction at its best.,"Even though I am a Christian and do believe in what these books are about, I cannot get over how much these are just pulp fiction books written about the end of times. The characters are not deep enough, we rarely ever get into their heads. The plot while pushed by information in the Bible seems to be lagging as if they are trying to stretch it out for more money. Maybe its just me, but it seems to be that they could have wrapped this series up before now."
2,A good concept not taken far enough,"This is subject matter with great potential, but not well executed. Better novels are McCammon's SWANG SONG, or Kleier's THE LAST DAY. THE LAST DAY is the scarier and more nerve-racking of the two, and it has a compelling message readers will find provocative, if not disturbing. But don't read it if you're spiritual nature is easily bruised!"
1,loony tunes,"this is no more inspired by the word/spirit of god than the ""book of mormon"" is. jesus is love and i sure don't see love in these books."
2,"Unfortunately, good intentions don't excuse poor talent","I have no doubt whatsoever that the authors have the best intentions with this novel. Unfortunately, those intentions do not make a good read. This is a very poorly written novel. The message is wondeful, but I found myself turned off by the lack of talent. There are many ways to spread the Lord's message, and I quite simply don't feel that Jenkins and LaHaye are suited to doing so in a fictional novel. I understand that these novels are very popular, but I think that the message has been better served fictionaly by more competant novels such as We All Fall Down by Caldwell. The Bible tells us to make sure that our actions never appear to be anything other than holy, so that those who are looking for the truth will not be put off by our outward actions. The same holds true for novels. The messege is often judged upon the messenger, and badly constructed novels do not do the message of God any good."
1,"Boys & Girls, This is Ludicrous","The first book was not well written. By this time, I would expect some improvement, but no-o-o! Not these folks!Not only is the writing just as wooden, just as scarily unconnected, now there are active contradictions. Not minor stuff, either. Steele's wife's name. Behavior. Actions.Look, characterization isn't that hard. Neither is writing emotions that convince the reader. These people don't experience faith, or fear, or any other feeling. We're told about it.Spare me! Stop writing this stuff! Or write better, one or the other. I know you can sell millions of these awful, thinly-plotted, badly characterized screeds because believers have far too little to read that entertains, enlightens and instructs. But please, work harder! And you readers! Just because it's about Christians facing the apocolypse doesn't mean it's any good. Figure that out and stop giving this stuff five stars!Ok, I've vented. But don't read this! It's gone beyond bad to squirmingly embarassing."
2,The First Three Are Good - These Past Two Are Not As Good,"Book five continues the twist and turn towards something that feels more like a Bible tract that needs to be handed out door-to-door. Moving away from the fantastic plot and character development of the first three books, LaHaye and Jenkins really begin a downward trend of not following upon previous successes for the series. There are several new characters that get added to the mix - some believers, some not. No background is explored on these new characters - so it is as if they are just dropped into the story as convenient stage props for the story. Honestly, this is the worst of the series thus far, simply because of the poor plot and character mechanics that these two have chosen to ignore in favor of treating the story as a well-bound Bible tract."
3,"A good series, but not great","I've just finished book nine from the series, Desecration and find myself agreeing with many other reviewers. This is a good series, but not great. The characters never really come alive and the plot definitly seems to begin slowing down in order to strech it out to cover more books. Still, these novels are simple, easy reads and go into some pretty good depth when it comes to the particulars of Revelations. I could see this series as being very good for teen-agers, although as an adult, they aren't as challenging as they could be. If you're looking for greatness, I agree with many others that We All Fall Down by Caldwell and The Christ Clone Trilogy by BeauSeigneur are still the best of the genre- intellegent, well written, and very powerful."
5,Apollyon,It was very good. Kept you interested the whole time. Can't wait to read all the other books in the series.
3,"Mind boggling, scriptural facts.",A very descriptive life changing novel of what is yet to come before the coming of the Lord. A novel that leaves you searching for more.
2,Time to wrap up the series!,"I was disappointed. Left Behind was great, but each succeeding book seems to get worse than the one before. It seems like they are dragging out the series on purpose. I hope Assassins is better."
2,My analysis after three books in the set,"I know a good many people enjoy these Lahaye/Jenkins novels because they are very biblically oriented, and that's all well and good, I don't knock it. But as literature goes, to be honest, these books are NOT very well written. The characters are thin, artificial, the writing forced and simplistic. A far deeper and more compelling Apocalyptic novel is Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY. Although NOT biblically accurate in many apsects, the story is hugely suspenseful and the spiritual nature far deeper than any of the three books of this series I've read so far, APOLLYON, TRIBULATION and LEFT BEHIND. Because of this, I found THE LAST DAY considerably more fulfilling, spiritually, and certainly more thrilling from a literary perspective. If your interest is a superior story, and less the scriptural application, THE LAST DAY is a more rewarding read."
2,Wait a minute here . . .,"If Apollyon the Destroyer had his head on straight he'd vaporize every last copy of these comic books Tyndale is shoving down our throats twice a year. Rayford Steele ? Who's he, Remington Steele's brother ? Buck ? Do YOU know anyone actually named Buck ? I don't. Chloe ? That's a perfume. Nicolae Carpathia ? NICOLAE CARPATHIA ? ? ? Where did our intrepid authors come up with these corny names, an old copy of Boy's Life ? Then there's these goofy pregnancies . . . didn't Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble both conveniently get pregnant when people started losing interest in The Big Show ? These fellows have taken the sacred book of Revelation and turned it into a cheap soap opera. I'm a Christian and I'm very embarrassed right now."
2,That's exactly my point. . . kind of,"I partly agree with the last reviewer. These books are most definately not great literature. Unfortunately for me, I happen to think that they're pretty lousy reads too. The only good thing about these books is the message of coming to Christ. Message alone does not a book carry."
1,"It's become a soap opera, sad to say.","The series started off okay, but it's really gone downhill the last few books. It now feels more like a made-for-TV movie or miniseries, and an overly long and drawn out one at that. Now that they're cranking out the books twice a year, they necessarily have to drag out the action so barely anything happens in each individual book. Just like daytime soaps, where not much happens from month to month. I'm sorry, but I'm no longer impressed and don't think it's worth buying in hardcover anymore."
3,Small Version,"Apollyon: The Destroyer Is Unleashed (Left Behind No. 5)I received the small verson of this book, sized only about 90% of the actual size of books that you can get in bookstores. Also, some of these smaller versions have yellowed (inferior paper) pages. I will not order anymore ""used"" books when they're for a collection."
3,The battle for eternity...,"The battle for eternity continues, but the soap opera is becoming...well...a soap opera. For those who desire a wilder, more thought-provoking ride, try Steve Alten's RESURRECTION (read DOMAIN first). While Apollyon was good, Resurrection presents things I've never read or imagined before, and really kept me guessing what was coming next."
5,Best book in the series?,I love these books! I've thought this was the best one yet although I've thought that about Left Behind and Nicolae when I finished them. These books are captivating! I am impressed with how close they are to the actual prophesies in Revelation. I really believe that it could happen very closely to the way it is described in these books. Thank God I'll already be with Him and not be left behind. Keep up the good work! I can't wait for the next one. I think I'll start reading them over until it comes out!
4,"A good, but not great follow-up to ""Left Behind"".","I am beginning to think that by the time this series ends I will know the ending from experience.The first book had possibly as great an impact on me as anything I have ever read. It made me reassess my own state of salvation and re-dedicate myself to my personal savior. That's a pretty tough act to follow. However, I definitely feel that the authors are stretching this a bit. After 5 books we should be at least to the halfway point.But, it is a pretty good read. I read it at the same time I was reading George Stephanopoulis' book ""All Too Human"". The contrast of both style and content gave me a greater appreciation for this book."
5,Outstanding! The most action packed in the series!,"I began reading the other books in the series in the fall and finished the fourth book during a plane ride to the Holy Land. To say the least, standing at the Western Wall after reading the fourth book truly brought the whole book of Revelation to reality. This fifth book, again focusing so much on Jerusalem and Israel brought back God's power and glory to a new sense of awe. I enjoyed how closely it paralled scripture in its descriptions of the locust attack. I can't wait for the next book. Most enjoyable books I've read in a long time!"
5,Fictional yet factual - astounding!,Absolutely wonderful reading. Every book has had me captivated. I thoroughly look forward to curling up with these awesome books at bedtime. What will I do when the series is finished?
1,what a lousy series.,Our Heavenly Father has given us the free will to read better books than these.
2,This book was a disappointment!,"I was truly hooked by Left Behind. However, I thought Tribulation Force was a bit long winded. Then I was caught up in Nicolae and Soul Harvest. I thought a streak of excellent story lines would be coming. Alas! Then came Apollyon and I found myself wanting to skip pages. The ""fillers"" had returned. I know about the character's pasts, I read the books. Moreover, I really do not need each book to go over the same personal details again and again when the story could be moving on. I simply found Apollyon boring. I do not plan to give up on the series yet, because the overall story is interesting. I am not religous, but this series made me think about the meaning of the Bible. However, even with this in mind, if the next book in the series uses old details as ""filler"", I may see this as a ploy to make more books than necessary (meaning more money to be spent by readers). I would find this truly sad considering the impact of some of the earlier books."
1,Condescending garbage,"Jenkins and Lahaye have taken the sacred book of Revelation and turned it into a cheap soap opera. This whole series started out with such promise, but $$$$$$$$$ has spoken and quality of writing and the respect for those of us who used to be willing to read this stuff has been long forgotten. Jenkins and LaHaye should take all of the money they've milked out of this series and wander the wilderness for 40 years."
1,yuck,"I was practically forced to read these books by my relatives, who think they're great. If you ask me, I've seen better writing on the back of shampoo bottles. Some people have accused Lahaye and Jenkins of using scare tactics -- that's true, but the scariest thing is their complete lack of talent."
5,Apollyon my review,"Carpathia confronts the two witnesses and was not satisfied with the outcome. Hattie feels unworthy of God's grace for her part in Carpathia's rise to power. The tribulation force plans on staying one step ahead of the danger from global community officials but is that enough? As subzero temperatures engulf the earth and frightening insects terrorize the inhabitants will this bring the people closer to God?Riveting, unpredictable with lots of twists and turns this novel, as the others before it, will keep you on the edge of your seat anticipating the outcome. I have grown quite fond of the characters and look forward to reading the next in the series. So intune for today's world I highly recommend this book. Read the book of Revelation in novel form, it is a fast read, and definately hard to put down, has excellent character and scene development. I as the reader felt I was transported to the different locations in the storyline witnessing the future come to life."
4,A bit better than before...,"After reading number four in the series and being a tiny bit disappointed, the title of this one had me excited that perhaps the storyline would pick up again and really take off once more. It implied action, and while I must admit that the storyline did indeed pick up some in the fifth book over the fourth, the series itself is still losing momentum. The first three books captured my attention and riveted me but these last two have left me feeling a bit ""preached to"" and not really feeling the characters as much as I'd like. I'm not happy about the writer's decisions about what to do with two of the characters I thought were leads who seem to be absent from the plot now. It left me feeling a bit dispassionate about the series compared to how I felt before."
3,"'Apollyon' is good, but 'The Fist of God' is great!","Apollyon is a well written novel, and I enjoyed it. But, 'The Fist of God' by A.T Nicholas will blow you away!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This book is one of the best I have ever read. God and Satan go head to head in a bloody battle for souls. Nicholas' writing style is so fresh. It's quick and slick, he gets to the point like a run away train. The Fist of God is filled with tons of symbolism and vivid imagery. You will love this book. I couldn't put it down. I read it in two days! After you read 'The Fist of God' you will be telling everyone that you have a book that they have to read."
5,These books are a tool,"To all those people who say that these books would never bring anyone to Jesus, I disagree. My Father, who is an unbeliever has read them all and loves them. He now asks my Mother about Jesus. It got his attention. He attends Church with her now. Something he has never done before. Praise the Lord!! He has not yet accepted Jesus, but he is a ton closer than before these books. I too pray for all those who gave these books poor reviews, they seem angry. At what? Maybe these books didn't work for you, but you need to realize that they did for others. You should be happy about that."
4,Holds Your Attention,"The entire series, from ""Left Behind"" to Apollyon"", has held my attention. The fact that I just found out about these books has allowed me to read them in quickly in succession. The only negative thing now is that I must wait until August for the next book. ""Apollyon"" was action-packed, the most gruesome thanks to the locusts and yet keeps the reader's full attention. Whether it was wondering when Buck would get home, if Hattie or Chloe would actually have a baby in that terrible world, what would the witnesses do next, Tsion's intrepretation of the next event or if Nicholae would destroy more of the Tribulation Force, my attention was keenly focused on this material. Another benefit is that I have found a deeper desire to try and read Revelations again. Thanks for an exciting series and I look for to reading ""Assasins""."
5,The Best One Yet!,Apollyon is by far the bet book yet in the series. Tim and Jerry continue to amaze me with the excellent writing of the series and how they really bring the characters out. It really shows God trying to get the attention of the people He loves and wants. Keep up the good work!
5,The best yet.,"I received Apollyon on Saturday and finished it on Sunday. It is the best of the five thus far and I can hardly wait until August for ""Assassins"". It makes you think long and hard to ensure your faith is sincere, and if it isn't to make sure you get right with God.I encourage everyone to read them. What an encouragement for Christians and a wake-up call for non-Christians"
3,Not as good as the others,"Left Behind was a great book, it made me look at at walk with Christ. It it has gotten me to STUDY scripture not just read. However the other books leave much to be desired. It seems as if Tim and Jerry have gotten tired or have just been rushing to end the book. I look forward to the next book hopefully they will ""complete it"""
2,Are White Americans the only people the authors can write?,"The minorities ( few that there are) are written in an insulting stereotype. for Example an Iraqi is quoted as saying ""please not to be landing here..."" I have never heard any Arab speak that way. This character sounded like the satirical Apu from the Simpsons. There are no people of color, any color included in these books. I started out liking the books but was disturbed by the incidents of racial stereotyping. What is most disturbing is the fact that White Supremecist Matthew Hales is known as Pontifex Maximus of the One World Church of the Creator. Please tell me He stole this idea!"
1,buyer beware,"While this is a very nice looking ring it is not real sterling silver. I've had it for less than a few days and it's already started to turn my finger green. It is stamped with 925 on the inside, but it surely is not. The inside of the ring is already starting to 'wear' off. Very disappointing because I would have been more than willing to spend a few extra dollars on this to get a REAL STERLING SILVER RING. Buyers if you are looking for real solid sterling silver, don't waste your money here. I'm going to be very reluctant to purchase anything else from this seller.NOTE: you can even see the wear marks on the inside of the ring in their photo they provide! See the black smudges?!"
5,Great Ring!,"This is an unusual ring that looks fabulous, and looks even better in person. Given as a gift the other person absolutely loves it and gets many compliments daily!"
4,Sterling silver ring,"This is a very attractive ring. I have received numerous compliments and it is a true to size ring. The only problem is that it will bend easily if caught on something, but that is to be expected due to the length of the ring."
2,NOT Sterling Silver,"Watch out, buyers--this ring is NOT sterling silver. It turned my finger green in less than 24 hours. I love the design; it's very unique, but it is not what it has been advertised as. I had to use the clear nail polish method to keep it from turning my finger green. If you want a cool ring that is not actual silver, then this is the ring for you. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,Sloppy writing and very repetitious...,"The previous reviewer is so on point, and the book is so bad, it doesn't even merit more than a brief dis..."
3,Like merengue much?,This album provides the same three notes in ten different ways. I bought the album because I listened to it as a girl. It has a newer rendition of a great song.
4,Great for beginners,"Well, I have to say I got this tape 2 days ago. I've only used this once but the day after I was sore in my chest area,upper arms and buns/thighs!I haven't worked out in a little over a year and found this tape fun and a little challenging(especially the floor exercises)My outer thighs were burning. I think there should me more cardio, I'm used to my tae bo where I'm trying to catch my breath..(update)Ok, so after 2 weeks 3x a week I am definately noticing a difference. My legs are slimmer and I'm not sure why but the second time I used the tape it seemed a lot harder. I was actually a little out of breath at one point.You will work up a sweat for sure. I've noticed my fanny is ""up"" a bit. Just in 2 weeks! A step is a must for this tape! I use my little brothers' stepper which is about 8inches high."
4,Good Video,"I must say, I own about 12 Firm tapes, and the first time I did this workout, it felt like I didn't really get a good workout at all. I felt like it was a breeze. Then I tried it for a second time, and it was challenging, but I was not a bit sore the next day. It did bring my heart rate up, and I did sweat, so I would recommend it for beginners to intermediate."
4,Fun !!,"I found this video to be fun and intermediately tough. It's about 55 minutes long. The only thing I think it needs is a longer ab segment. I enjoy it and do it a couple of times a week, and feel like I get a good workout every time. Allie is a good instructor and easy to follow and her cueing is really great !!!"
4,newer look but not as tough,"I own many Firm videos old & new and this one is pretty good, although I don't feel as though I'm getting as much cardio in it as the older Firm videos. It's still a pretty good video, with newer moves. It's good if you have some type of a step up platform--I own the 10 & 14-inch platform and it works great...but as mentioned, it's not as challenging."
4,Pretty good workout,"I used to have all of the original Firm workouts from the late 80's but I had to get rid of them all because they bothered an old back injury. Luckily the newer generation of Firm tapes don't hurt my back and still give me an effective workout. This one is not my favorite, but still a decent workout. Allie has always been one of my favorite instructors. It's an effective blend of cardio and weights. The only part I really don't like is one move used in this tape and the Body Sculpt tape where you lay on your stomach over the fanny lifter and lift weights in a v-motion, it's an uncomfortable exercise. Otherwise a good, effective workout. BTW, using a regular height step just does not compare to the intensity that the fanny lifter adds. Recommend getting the fanny lifter, it definitely made a difference in my thigh and butt."
3,Stick to the Classics,This is a good tape if you haven't been spoiled with the Classic Firm tapes from the 80s!
4,Is ok but not the most challenging...,"This tape came included with the Body System 1...so far so good...is not quite as challenging as the older Firm videos...is a good workout when I dont feel like challenging myself...but for a good sweat I still stick to Susan Harris Vols 1 and 4...and the Tought Aerobic Mix...you see I come from the Old School..when the Fanny Lifter was made of wood...I must said though I love the Firm....however, I also discovered that Anna Benson has a new line call PrimeFit...I may check out those videos too since I dont seem to catch up with ""The Firm"" accesories.... now there is a new Fanny Lifter....I wont be buying that."
2,its ok but I gave it away,"Although I love the Firm, this one is not my favorite.It is a good workout,there is just something about it...it drags.Perhaps Ms DelRio is not quite as toned as one would hope..I don't know.At one point she has her eyes shut while she squats.I have dozens of Firms and some with this instructor, that I like.It seems that most Firm videos have a way of tricking you into working out hard before you know it, but this one falls short in some indescribable way."
2,burns out in about a year,"I've bought four of these during the last few years. Each has lasted about a year before a bulb burns out. If they were on 24/7, and they're not, that would be at most 8760 hours, considerably less than the claimed 40000 hours lifetime. They've been mounted under a laptop stand to illuminate a keyboard. That's a very well-ventilated and protected location and it's powered from a surge-protected power strip. I'm now searching for LED strip lights or other alternatives such as an illuminated Mac keyboard."
3,*YAWN* .... what else is on?,"As a an avid Morrissey fan, living in LA with a Mexican girlfriend that also loves Morrissey, I thought this documentary on why Latinos make up Morrissey's biggest fan base in LA... would be.... well, interesting. But it wasn't, at least not to me, personally. Basically this interview consists of a lot of interviews of Latinos who love Morrissey but don't necessarily articulate it in the most eloquent or original way to make them worthy of being included in a video documentary. Save yourself the 20 bucks and just ask a Latino Mozhead what he/she thinks of Morrissey... repeat this with different Latino Mozheads for 90 minutes and that's the documentary. This documentary really doesn't hold one's interest for more than 10 minutes. This would have made a good 10 minute documentary."
3,"The book ""STRAIGHT LIFE"" is better","This DVD does not compare with Pepper's excellent and shocking autobiography. Not even close. The book, ""Straight Life"" is much, much more detailed and interesting. That being said however, this DVD was good as it had clips of Art Pepper playing."
1,Nearly completely worthless,This text must be one of the worst books on ethics I've ever seen. The authors start with a basic assumption that information technology changes ethical issues and never examine this fundamentally flawed belief. The essays are extreme and manage to make their own points sound rediculous even when they are reasonable.There are errors in their references and their interpretation and use of other texts.This book is painful to read.
1,they sent me the wrong edition,"I ordered Elements of Argument: A Text and Reader the ninth edition, I was sent the seventh edition. Because of this mix up I didn't have the materials that I needed for class and ended up spending my money at the student book store to buy a second book. Over all I have been very disappointed with my service ."
2,Arguementative,"This book introduces the important elements of writing and/or reading an arguement. However, I found while reading it I was in danger of falling asleep only to be awakened by its occasional sample arguement and sample advertisements that are intresting. I am unsure if this is just a difficult subject to write about, or what."
3,Good Text,I found this book to be very help full for not only it's content but it's language and focus. Even though it could but you to sleep. I learned a lot about how to analize arguments not only oraly but on paper over all it's a great book and I would recommed it for any learning envirnmont.
1,RIPOFF!!,"If the DVD version which I have NEW at home, which includes two different movies is about $10, who in their right mind would pay what these sellers are asking, $120 USED? Seems like corportate America has some competition."
5,fit and fun...,"Finally a workout that's challenging and entertaining at the same time. Fast paced but easy to follow. Great ""eye candy"" as well."
4,Great Workout,This is a great workout with awesome music. The only complaint I have is that the lead-in is to long
2,A futile effort,What absolute rot! Diversity is not an argument for abolishing a phenomenon and a category.
5,A great CD,English Folk Song Suit is one of my favorite pieces ever! I first heard the song when I played it in Windensambe. It's an exciting piece to play and to listen to. I would recommend this Cd to anyone with an intrest in great music.
3,Vaughn-Williams- a collection of his shorter orchestral works,"Aside from the more popular Vaughan-Williams compositions-""Fantasia on Greensleeves"", ""The Lark Ascending"", ""Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis"" and the ""English Folk Song Suite"",I found the rest of the compositions on this 2 disc collection to be disappoingly banal and dull. I was hoping to find more of them in to be in the same vein as the lively English Folk Song Suite or Greensleeves but they fell far short of my expectations and unforunately my appreciation of the composer's works continues to temain inconsistent. The quality of the production of the set was fine except that I own a better version of the Lark."
2,Not good for Toddlers...,"While I can certainly appreciate the sketches and the broad choice of words the author chose to include in this book, I don't think it is at all appropriate for toddlers who are just learning to speak. First of all, my child has a much easier time manipulating board book pages than he does these thin, glossy ones. Second of all, the renderings take some slight artistic license...making it very difficult for my child to recognize the objects and associate them with things in the ""real world."" In my opinion, this book is better suited for the higher end of toddlers and preschoolers only...and young toddlers should stick to books that use actual photographs."
1,Didn't last 12 months.,"The Omega Seamaster is a great watch, but I suddenly noticed that the crown was not screwed down tight. I cannot screw the crown down and it wobbles. This renders the watch useless. I called about the so called Amazon Warranty but it does not cover the crown or most other parts. You better read the not covered section of the warranty before any purchase from Amazon. Amazon says it is not covered by Omega because it was not purchased from an authorized dealer. They said to bad the watch still works and we don't cover the crown."
4,!No lo vamos a olvidar!,"Yes, Castaneda is the number one Che fan; however, his biography of Ernesto Guevara is well-written with facts and vivid descriptions that still linger in the mind long after you finish reading the book. Definitely recommended for all looking to learn more about this argentine doctor turned revolutionary, and the paths that led him to the jungles of Bolivia. Castaneda also introduces the human side of Che, so even if one disagrees with his cause, his strong and determined spirit is one to be admired!"
5,"Che, the symbol of a true revolutionary.","Che is my hero, my mentor, my insiration. Che embodies the revolutionary spirit, the will-power to suceed, and determination of human truth; yet held the understanding to see his mistakes and errors. He lived and died a man alone in this world. Betrayed by the USSR, betrayed by the Communist Parties of Latin America, betrayed by the Cuban government, and ultimately betrayed by his guerrillas and people in Bolivia. Companero is a wonderful book and captures the spirit of Che.."
1,Would give zero stars,My husband bought me these pjs. I hadn't worn them but packed them in the bag to bring to the hospital after my daughter was born. Did I mention he got them a size to big to accomodate my pregnancy bloated-ness. I wore them for the first time at the hospital and they ripped. They are un-wearable after half a use. They're flimsy and I actually wasn't very fond of them anyways because the fabric made me feel like I had a plastic drapped around my body (it did NOT breathe... even a little). So don't waste your money. These are not worth the packaging they come in.
3,mens pajamas...in my opinion,"Sizing...Garment is quite oversized...which would be normal for pjs, however, the top buttons left over right - traditional to mens wear, instead of right over left - traditional to womens wear..that is why I gave it only 3 stars. If I had wanted mens pjs, I would have ordered mens pjs."
3,weird sizing,"Although the waist measurements seem to be almost tight, the rest of it feels like a rapper's clothes..."
1,Ain't no Alvin,"I have only listened to a few of the tracks on this CD,and I was very disappointed. It is not Alvin Lee playing guitar or singing, a new kid, Joe Gooch?Alvin Lee was such a driving force in TYA, that he really is not replaceable, and although Joe can play, he is nowhere near Alvin in talent, emotion, and raw energy.Save your money, and buy Classic TYA, or Alvin Lee's solo efforts."
1,Not all Original Members,"Just seems important to mention that even though this CD says with ""original members"" ALVIN LEE, the guitarist and singer for TYA, does not play on it."
1,Not the real deal,"What a disappointment! This CD was listed as being TYA with the original members, so naturally I thought I'd be hearing a work-out by the greatest guitarist of all time, Alvin Lee. Not so, people! It seems the rhythm section of this once great band has taken on a ""replacement"" for someone who can't possibly be replaced! The guitar player on this album is good, but lacks the fire, passion and legendary ability of the fellow he's trying to imitate. Ignore this overpriced CD."
5,Great DVD for kids!,"This DVD comes with the following episodes: Mr. Fix-it Franklin, Franklin's submarine, Franklin delivers, My Franklin, Franklin's day off."
2,Paper too big,"The paper that came with the spinner was fine, but I had to use that paper as a guide to trim a good 1/4"" off the sides of this paper because it bowed up and wouldn't allow the spinner to spin. It would be better to just buy card stock. Also, the black cards are GLOSSY and the paint slid RIGHT OFF of it. We had to use the back side (which is white). So long for cool black ones. Again; card stock! And the paint bottles it came with are TINY! Unlike the original paint that came with the spinner, you had to cut the tips off, and no matter how carefully you cut the tip off to the end as much as possible, it was too big and came out too fast.Save your money; re-use the original spinner bottles, make your own paint, and cut out the paper from cardstock."
1,Not what I expected,"I am rather disappointed. I had one of these as a kid and loved it. I have never had a problem with the original stuff that came with the spinner. The paint dispensers are terrible! The purple one exploded when I cut the tip. Mine only came with four colors as opposed to the five pictured and spoken of in the packaging (blue, yellow, green and purple). The paint is VERY thick and does not spatter correctly. I have nothing good to say about this."
1,Difficult to get paint out of dispensers,"My 6 y/o couldn't squeeze the paint out of these dispensers, so I tried to enlarge the openings by snipping the tips off. However, then the paint came out too fast & the paper got soggy. :("
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!,"This refill kit does NOT fit the Imaginarium Spin Art product. There were two different sizes of paper and even the largest didn't come anywhere near the paper guides, making both sizes unusable unless you attach a piece of tape to the back of the paper. The instructions that came with the refill set said that it included glitter--it did not. The paint was incredibly thick and two of the bottles were completely cracked all around the neck. I had to add water to thin out the paint and it still kept thickening up. USELESS, USELESS product. I recommend to try and find refill kits sold by Imaginarium if that is the product you have. Do not buy this one."
2,Max,"Better than this author's usual efforts. This is a series of spanking and cp scenes which read like a collection of 'reader's stories' from a spanking fetish magazine.Some scenes are quite erotic, but as is so often the case he tends to become repetative after a while."
1,Max,This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. There is nothing to it. All it is about is teenage girls getting beaten. To the point that if it ever happened that would probably be dead. There is not sex just one rape. Then the last fifteen girl is beaten until they kill her. This is not enjoyable reading nor anything sexual. Even a men would not be interested in abusing teenage girls unless they are really sick. This is the first book by Richard Manton I have read and will be the last.
1,Ughhhhhh,"Terrible. I like childens movies. Air Bud was far better. Poor editing and bad acting and a bad story (including a criminal after a dog!!!!!!!) made this hard to watch. When the dog plays soccer, it looks so fake. You see a goal and then a super-imposed dog going over it and hitting a ball. I am twelve years old, and I saw the most mistakes I have ever seen in a movie (and I've seen lots of movies). This movie is terrible and too mundane."
1,Not a good movie for children!!!,"This purports to be a fun children's movie about a dog playing soccer and an orphan fitting in with his new family. Instead, it has an evil twist that includes a demonic dog catcher that terrorizes the canines and mean-spirited children being nasty to other kids. I ended up fast forwarding to only the dog playing soccer parts; the other parts were either too stupid, scary or ill-conceived to let my daughter watch them. I don't know why a child's movie has to have such cruelty and nastiness.Besides the above, the plot and dialogue is terribly crafted. This is one I would definitely avoid--regardless of the cute cover that appeals to children."
1,Red carded,"We have two young boys who love soccer, so this movie seemed like a natural. Wrong. The acting and character development are just plain odd, and to top it off there's a very dark subplot about a mafioso who ""fixes"" pee wee soccer games. He actually poisons a kid at one point. The ""dog playing soccer"" scenes are very poorly done compared to Air Bud. Skip it."
1,Abysmally Bad Movie,"Where to begin?! I don't normally write reviews, but this movie was so remarkably bad that I couldn't remain silent. The plot is thin, the acting is awful, the writing is worse. Save your time and money! If you MUST watch a movie about a dog playing soccer, go for the ""Air Bud"" version."
4,FUN to watch,"The opening scene is worth the money I paid for this show. The lead female must have been having a sex dream with all the moaning, tossing and turning going on. The rest of the show was all right. But not one of there best show."
5,Much better package than the newer and cheaper release,"Five disks all well labeled. Strange packaging, with the disks layered. Works fine though. Maybe a packaging experiment in the early 90s.(The new and cheaper release is junk. Three disks, no labeling and over compressed.)These ARE grainy at times. It comes and goes. Also odd. But, overall, I don't care. The first episode seems the worst.These shows are great and at $23.95 you can't go wrong. A really unique and entertaining series."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This the cheesiest and stupidest Si Fi TV series since ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Captain Video"" in the 1950s!! The sets are cheesy, the costumes are cheesy, the dialogue is cheesy, and the acting is cheesy!!"
3,LEXX- I guess it's OK,"I am a big Sci-Fi fan. I routinely purchase ""Made for TV"" or ""Made for Cable"" series, so I had read and heard that LEXX was another well-accepted ""classic"". It ran for four years, so obviously it had a following. I found that LEXX is kind of a cross between ""Farscape"" and the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" genre. I guess you either like it or you don't. I really enjoyed ""Farscape""..... and especially enjoyed ""Firefly""..... but LEXX not so much. ""Star Trek""....."" Battlestar Galactica"".... both very elegant and engaging series. LEXX is much more ""blue collar"". Some guts and gore mixed with a little female sensuality at times and very bizarre humor. When they qualify it as ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""..... yeah, I'd say that is fairly accurate. Just don't expect ""elegance"" in this series."
5,Lexx is AWESOME...,"This is just a ridiculously fun show. If you are into Hard-core Sci fi, it falls apart, but as an entertaining ""Saturday Matinee"" this rocks! Of course I am a fan of some rather peculiar Books and Video...."
2,Is what it is.,"V ery campy. Not much special effects for scify. Acting is simplistic, as are st5ory ;ines. Very basic tv fare."
4,Second Season Winner,"The first season is the best but the second season is quite good. Pay attention to the other ""real people"" that have reviewed it. First of all LEXX was out long before Farscape so the ridiculous line about sound familiar is out of context. LEXX is unique in its approach to SciFi. It is far more graphic in violence and erotic behavior than other series you will see. I have purchased the first two seasons on DVD since I think they are the best. The rest are worth seeing but I am not sure about buying."
2,A review of the product (not the content).,"I love Lexx, but the packaging for this item is terrible. I am reviewing the boxed season two of Lexx sold by Alliance. The discs are held by plastic prongs that require the DVDs to be slid across one another and the packaging. The result is inevitable damage. Because of the poor design, it is likely any copy you buy will be damaged in shipping, as the discs can come loose easily from jarring. The same problem exists with season four, not so much with season 3. I had trouble finishing two episodes in the second season the first time I tried to play them. For some reason, the Blu-ray player was able to read them after I lent them to a friend. It was likely a mechanical error on the part of my player, but there are obvious scratches on the discs from them slipping in transit."
5,offbeat,"Good scifi action not the usual. Offbeat,Stan the captain a horny coward,Zev the love slave half lizard,790 the robot head obsessed love of Zev which to me was goofy who always wants to get rid of Stan who he sees as getting in the way of his love of Zev & the only chacter I did not like. Kai the dead asassin who kills whomever Zev or the captain wants him to or to protect them & get them out of the trouble they always seem to get into with there obsessions. Finally Lexx the most powerful wheapon in the two known univerces who is a live bug ship that obliterates whole planets at the whim of whoever is captain but needs to eat organic matter to live. Worth the price & very enjoyable."
3,some naysaying for y'all,"There are some beautiful moments here-maybe enough to justify the price of admission-but after reading the reviews here and elsewhere, I was disappointed. These Soviet pianists were conservative, there's just no getting around it. I bought this mainly for the Mazurkas, and found that Sofronitsky believes there's one way to play Chopin--whether it's a nocturne, a prelude or a mazurka. And it's an old-fashioned approach to Chopin--lots of rubato, lots of dynamic changes, and no little banging. There may still be some people who appreciate this declamatory style, but I don't think it was ever right for the Mazurkas; apart from everything else, it disfigures the rhythm. As for the Scriabin, I don't much like the composer, but if everyone says Sofronitsky is close to definitive then far be it from me... (he was Scriabin's son-in-law, I guess)."
5,"Does the job, but the photo is incorrect","Not a review so much as clarification, though the fluid certainly does the job.The listing currently shows a photo of a bottle, but this listing is for a jar of this fluid, about 3 inches across and about 3 inches high, with a plastic strainer inside.Actually this is better than just a bottle, if you need the strainer. I would consider a bottle better to refill this with, and plan to keep this jar, once empty, for soaking the pen parts in."
4,Surprised,"I thought I would hear authentic Latino songs, but many were translations of English songs . . . (I didn't pay attention to the song list in the review I guess.) Still, it is enjoyable."
4,VERY NICE ITEM,"THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL COMPUTER CARRYING CASE FOR A LADY. TOOK IT ON A RECENT TRIP ON THE AIRPLANE AND IT DOUBLED AS MY PURSE ALSO. ONLY NEGATIVE THING I CAN SAY IS ""IT WAS A MIGHTY TIGHT SQUEEZE FOR MY HP WIDESCREEN LAPTOP"". HAD TO RUB SILICONE ON MY COMPUTER TO GET IT TO SLIDE IN. HARD TO GET BACK IN THE CASE AFTER AIRPORT SECURITY CHECK. OTHERWISE, I LOVE IT."
2,"A classic, but way oveer the top.","OK, OK, this is ""a classic film""--very influential, introducing ground breaking film techniques, and all that. And yes, it ushers in the New Age by convincing us all that there is no such thing as objective Truth--just ""personal perspectives."" But holy over-acting Batman! Can anyone say that they ever, for one second, believed in these clownish characters? I know--I'm supposed to allow room for ""Japanese cultural standards of film making,"" but I have some Japanese friends, and THEY sure don't act anything like these over-the-top performances. Frankly my dear, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Blame me for being so ethnocentric, but I say skip this stuff and read Shakespeare instead."
3,"Well, yeah...it's a LITTLE short of a masterpiece...","I recently read a review -- on Amazon.com, as a matter of fact, that called ""Rashomon"" ""nothing short of a masterpiece.""I wouldn't go that far.I've heard this film classified as a bonafide classics. Old foreign films are my bag, baby, but I was phenomenally let down by ""Rashomon.""The premise is very intriguing, which is why I chose to rent it in the first place. Besides, it's a Kurosawa.But it wasn't that good! Come on, get off the masterpiece stuff. I didn't say it was terrible, it wasn't, but it's so over-rated, so MEDIOCRE that my head nearly exploded.Grrr. It don't seem like much of a classic to me."
4,Amazing,"Let me start by reminding people of the world that there are only a hand full of basic stories in existence. The rest of the stories are diverse versions of these basic hand full of plots. It's what makes Shakespeare a Classic... and the rest of those great artists.The concepts of betrayal, loyalty, love, and death. Money and murder etc.Rashomon had a plot o this magnitude, and for the time, this film is amazing. The scenes are amazing! I can't imagine what this guy looked like on set making it happen, but I imagine every time I watch this film."
5,The Outrage,"A viewer said ""Simply put this movie is 50 minutes too long."" Well, that's not the way _I_ remembered it."
2,Weird and Creepy,"A rather wierd film with histrionic acting, exaggerated facial gestures, outbursts of creepy laughter and an obtuse philosophy. Yes, I undestand the basic premise, but the execution itself is flawed. Somewhat interesting insofar as dealing with Japanese customs and rituals with which most of us be might be unfamiliar. The only real reason to view this film is that it's been deemed a ""Classic""--so it's good to find out what all the fuss is about. And make up your own mind."
3,An overated film,"While I love Kurosawa's samurai films and the great ""Kagemusha"", I think ""Rashomon"" is overrated, probably because 1) people who watch it already heard it was good, and 2) the cultured Western audience finds the story and acting exotic enough to be fascinating.I cannot say I dislike the film; in fact I like it. But I think the acting is over dramatic and the camera shots too staged. The acting in particular irks me, much like that in ""Ran"", because it looks too much like kabuki on stage. But ""Rashomon"" does have its style; it's just not a style I find comfortable with.The best part about ""Rashomon"" is its masteful editing techniques, which hides quite a few continuity flaws. In the end, very few of my Asian friends -- esp. Japanese -- like the movie because they view it portraying Asians in a negative light. I think this is something to be kept in mind as you watch it."
1,Defective,The dvd will play for 20 minutes and nothing else. Gave to son for christmas present and he lives 3 hrs away.
2,A Dud,"Okay, it's an interesting point that people who experience or witness a crime (or any life experience) can have different points of view, and that their perspectives on truth can be relative. Perhaps that was a shocking consideration in 1950. Nowadays, erg, it seems trivial. Add to that that the acting was often silly and overdone in a big way (seemed more like Kabuki than film), the silent film-esque sort of vibe got tedious, and the music grated on me after a certain point.All that said, perhaps this film was a mind-blower sixty years ago, but I can't help but think that the Wizard of Oz seems a hundred times more modern than this and came out 11 years earlier."
1,1 star because that as low as I'm allowed,Now before you come down on me for my low rating please know that I have a clear understanding of the plot and lesson this movie portrays about mankind. Simply put this movie is 50 minutes too long.
1,Kurosawa's examination of good and evil,"In Kurosawa's examination of good and evil, he missed the point, namely, that all men are evil. This is a film which featured four different accounts of a rape and murder, seeing it from different points of drunkeness. There are several reasons why this film is painful to watch. The first reason is the childish cinematography. I have a somewhat ambivalent reaction to it. Though the film is entertaining if the audience is gassed with sleeping fumes."
4,My Favorite Kurosawa Film!,"After learning about this film I became very interested to watch it. The idea of hearing FOUR different people's observations concerning a murder. What caught my attention was how TRUE TO LIFE the story is. Everything in life is dependent upon how we as individuals interpret situations depending on our different points of view. Just look at AMAZON! Here we have people voice their opinions on music,movies,books ect... And it's all based on our understanding of what we see and hear. I guess we always know this about our society but perhaps we stick it in the back of our heads. It's really amazing if you just sit back and think about it,how events and not only that but our own lives are judged just on how we delineate things. Watch this movie and it will really open your eyes to how our society works. How everything in life is about our view of it. It's just fascinating! WATCH IT AND SEE"
5,RASHOMON rush!!!,"I just want to comment on the quality and speed of delivery aspect in this case. It was very professional indeed. It is a good...NO...great delivery system. We are very appreciate on how u guys handle. (Even though we are in Indonesia). Once again, Thanks!"
5,Simply an excellent film,"Rashomon is a fabulous film. When a nobleman is murdered and his wife raped while travelling through a wooded area, a bandit, played by Toshiro Mifune is accused of the crimes and an inquest is held. The witnesses--including the spirit of the murdered noblemen--each recount conflicting and contradictory accounts of what actually happened. To what extent it is the result of simple faulty memory or the product of willful deciet is for the viewer to decide, thus making for a very thought-provoking movie."
3,I wouldn't call it a masterpiece,"Let me start off by saying I love Kurosawa and have seen many of his films, but this one was a little slow and felt too simple and shallow. I got the point of what he was trying to say almost immediately (truth is relative and depends on the person and that everyone's version of a story is told to make him or her look best), and didn't need to go through every character's perspective to get that point. It felt like he painfully belabored the point and not much else was added to make the plot interesting. And in some places the acting was overdone for the plot/genre and was actually a little bit distracting to me. I'm not saying that I disliked the movie, I just didn't think it was that it could qualify as a masterpiece."
4,"Not Kurosawa's best, but still a must see","RASHOMON was a groundbreaking film for its time, one that called into question whether or not we can really know the ""truth"" behind anything since everyone's viewpoint is limited to their own subjective personality. The film recounts the same incident from different viewpoints, taking a bold narrative approach that would greatly influence filmmakers for several years, even up to this very day.While I feel there are some parts of the film that don't hold up very well, overall the movie has a very powerful effect at the end as everything finally comes to a head.For some interesting comparisons to RASHOMON, I would suggest the Paul Newman flick, THE OUTRAGE (1964), and Italian director Mario Bava's ultra-rare obscurity, FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT (1969), which puts a campy, erotic spin on the material."
5,A film for thinking people,This is a must-see before the next time you are called for jury duty. You could probably be dismissed from serving if you tell the judge you've seen it and you no longer can believe anyone giving testamony.
1,didn't like it,it just wasn't what i expected. kinda cheap felt material. no way would the appliques survive for the life of your child and no easy way to record height and dates.
5,Scary good,"Everything is simply amazing on this CD. Even the Chopin played at the seemingly ill-advised speed of light sounds marvelous. I can't say enough good things about the playing of Samson Francois; as soon as his complete recordings of Ravel are available in the US, I'll be buying it. You should, too."
2,poorly written non documented dribble,"This book was a great dissapointment. The author rambles from topics such as secret underground military tunnels linked by 700mph mag lev trains-to the Aurora project. I should have known that the book would be a study in paranoia, anything involving the term New World Order usually is, but I had hoped for something a bit more realistic from an analysis standpoint. The only good componants of this book involved some plausible presentations of various stealth aircraft of assorted sizes. Even than, the author goes of the deep end and asserts our B-2 bombers utilizes a secret new world order anti-gravity system. Hey, how about a little credit for the aliens?"
4,"Like a ""baby"" Avalon..?","Well, not quite an Avalon...but about a third the price. When my VXP - which I loved - crapped out, I replaced it with the Eureka, which was about the only thing in that price range I could trust. It's similar to the VXP but without the noise gate which I miss. I do like the GR/GAIN meter better than just the LED's the VXP used for levels. Another feature is the variable input impedance which is supposed to allow better matching of microphone to preamp. I'm using a tube Neumann U-67 and have the control set to 600 ohms. Sweeping the control from minimum to maximum doesn't seem to yield a huge difference in sound or tone with this particular mic but might with others especially ribbons. I still have my VXP which I will hold on to as a back up should the Eureka fail. I sent the VXP back to Presonus for service and for a very nominal fee, changed some parts and restored it to factory specs....great customer service."
3,Technique is Not Enough,"It's a gimme at this level the technique is there, as we find on this CD, regardless of the age of the solist. However, von Karajan's interpretation seems hastily prepared, with a legato strategy that smothers the subtle contrasts in articulation, tempo and dynamics that is a central part of Mozart's essence. Szell's versions are a real cut above this."
5,The best Mozart Violin Concerto recording ever,"I listened to other's Mozart Violin Concerto recording but none really comes close like this. Unlike other's uncertain interpretation of Mozart, her interpretation and intonation are confident, solid and perfect. I don't think no one else can play Mozart like Mutter does."
5,A Very Funny 72 Minutes,"Ricky Gervais is a comedian who is not afraid to push the boundaries of good taste.In this 72-minute special, filmed during his successful tour of the United States, the British funnyman not only pokes fun at charities that help the mentally and physically challenged, but also the Holocaust.The amazing thing is that you find yourself laughing out loud, sometimes uncontrollably, at the humor Gervais finds in these ordinarily taboo subjects.He also does extended hilarious routines on the male sexual organ and even Humpty Dumpty.Gervais is, indeed, one of the funniest comedians of this generation.Included on the DVD is a conversation with Gervais.Michael B. Druxman"
2,Gervais is brilliant; the stand-up not so much,"Ricky Gervais is not perfect, thank goodness. Obviously his second show Extras wasn't as good as The Office. But no show would be and Extras was in fact quite funny on its own terms. So he did seem a bit infallible. But while he's been a big success doing stand-up (which is still highly regarded in the UK), his first special feels a bit forced. So, funny at moments (especially that goofy cover costume) but not SO funny that we will all feel inferior forever. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
3,Eh.,"Sort of a terrible version of his other routines. Out of England only reminds me that he's so much better IN England. American audiences don't suffer much from all of the British references, so I felt this was unneeded. Not really any notable extras, picture quality so-so, packaging very cheap."
2,"Well, it is Gervais","It made my mom laugh. I guess this is good. It just seems like he's going through the motions. I think Fosters beer sponsored this thing. He keeps drinking from his can of Fosters and it just seems like he was getting paid for it. Also, could someone who has seen this explain to me his joke about 'going commando'? I know it's a stupid point but I don't think from his routine that he knows what it means to go commando. Whatever, Gervais rules, but I think we all expected a little more from this stand up."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I watched and watched this guy's routine and just didn't find him funny. After paying the rent fee for this, I could only watch about 15 mins so I wouldn't feel like I wasted my time along with my money."
2,Not for the serious Sudoku fan,"This works OK, but every puzzle I tried didn't have enough information to actually solve without guessing.If you aren't a serious Sudoku fan it would be a good choice because it is fun to use, but if you prefer to solve a puzzle through logic don't bother with this device."
2,Sudoku,"Hi, I feel in love with this type of puzzle. I wanted to get an electronic version of it, I went with this one. The game play is very easy with this one. Very simple navagation, just select your number and touch the screen were you want to number to go. There is one draw back and to me it is a big one. The numbers are to small and to hard to see unless you have very bright lighting in the room."
2,More travelogue than cookbook,"If you want to read how a group from Chicago made a PBS documentary (which I haven't seen), this is your book! The recipes are not part of ""Hidden Mexico"". And there aren't many of them."
4,Great book for general reference,"I recommend this book as a general reference book, sufficient to get a good grasp on the topic. However, keep in mind that the design methodology for sewer design varies from one jurisdiction to another."
3,blablabla,"Before watching the film i didn't think that Disney would be able to produce such a ""good"" film. The only negativ thing is the beginning and the end. I hate such such veeery happy endings.The film is about a wolf-dog and a digger (Hawke) who became good friends. I like this film because of Ethan Hawke. I love him."
4,"Thrilling scenic,tender and bold piece of cenimatic art!!!","Gorgeous and stark,snowy scenery are the back drop for a beautifully told animal story with interesting and touching human actors filling in! Wonderful sound and scoring by Paledouras. Adults and children both, will like this exciting & touching film. My baby dog watched the Wolf cubs to my amazement when I first viewed it as he laid on the floor beside my 52 year old male carcass."
4,White Fang - a wolf and a boy,I think that the film is realistic. It's about the friendship between a wolf and a human being. It shows that wolves are not as bad creatures as people think. Ethan Hawke is an excellent actor. The scenery shows how hard it was to survive in the wildeness of Canada. I like this film because I love movies with animals. You must see this film.
3,White Fang,"Entertaining movie, good photography, but too much variation from the actual Jack London Novel ""White Fang"" to be really good. Also, the movie left out the important emphasis in the book on the very tough and vicious upbringing of White Fang while defending himself from the ""Puppy Pack"" and its leader. This was a very important part of the story as these were the hard lessons he learned of survival, fighting, and self defense that were critical to his trials and tribulations later as a full grown wolf-dog. However, if you had never read the book then these detractors in the movie would not be that much of an issue."
4,"Nice family movie, 4*","good family movie. I enjoy watching it even as an adult. I give it a 4-stars. Entertaining, good for a rainy Sunday afternoon."
3,White Fang - A realistic film about the Canadian wilderness,I think this is a very dramatic film.It is about the friendship between a wolf and a human being. It shows that wolves are not as bad as people think.Ethan Hawke is an excellent actor. The scenery shows how hard it was to survive in the wilderness of Canada. This film also gives you a little impression about the goldrush and the cruelty and carelessness of some gold diggers.I like this film because it isn't just a story that Jack London has made up in his mind. It is a story that could really have happened some time ago. It shows the problems that people had to manage during the goldrush.
3,R2 IS ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN,The region 2 version is Widescreen Anamorphic with good picture quality and optional English subtitles.
1,This isn't Right,"The movie White Fang is no where as good as the book and it doesn't follow the book at all. It doesn't say anything about White Fangs rival Lip-Lip who is a pure domesticated dog with the Mackenzie Tribe. And also it doesn't tell you about his whole life, his family his mom, etc. Born To Death."
2,Good movie ---but nothing like the book,"I had read White Fang with my 8th graders recently and thought it might be good to compare with the movie. WOAH! Who is Jack? Where was Weedon Scott? Gray Beaver is actually kind of a nice guy in this movie. It was a good adventure movie, but if you are expecting it to be like the book, think again. It WAS good to show the students that movies aren't always accurate to the book, and that was a good lesson to teach. I would have liked this production to be truer to the novel, but not a bad movie to enjoy with the family."
4,White Fang- One of the best animal-film ever?,"The story tells us about a battered wolf, who becomes the best friend of a young gold digger called Jack (Ethan Hawke). The scenery of the wilderness and of the snowy Alaska is incredible. The dog-fight between White Fang and a bulldog is dramatic. If you like animal-storys, White Fang is the best film for you. The actors are convincing and the score is good. The film is so good because it's based on a partly true story. We think that the film includes fun, action and adventure. We liked the scene in which the wolf saves Jacks life by chasing away a grizzly bear best.It's a must to watch this film!"
1,disappointment!,"I am SO glad to get this from you! I was afraid I was going to have to go through my files and look for the invoice. I gave this tape to my grandaughter in her easter basket because she loves this book!! We then went out of town for two weeks. When I talked to my daughter from out of town she said that the first time they watched it the end of the tape cut out and they never got to see the end. It is a defective tape and it was a ""new"" tape. What do you suggest? Can I get a replacement?Thank you."
4,Exciting film,"This film is wonderful. I, too, regret that the DVD wasn't prepared in wide-screen format, but it is still a super film--great for family viewing."
3,Wolf and boy against the world!,"White Fang is a film about the friendship between a boy and a wolf. Alaska, the scenery, is very realistic, but I think it's a little bit implausible that at the end everything is good and everybody is happy. What made me feel sad, were the scenes with sad music. But it's very good, if the score can make you fell with the actors. I admire the wolves, especially those which are killed and hurt in the film. They're the best actors in this film, because none of them was really hurt."
3,"Jack London's ""real life"" story","It's one of the best adventure films ever made. The story is about the friendship between a man who is a gold digger and a wolf. It's fascinating how Ethan Hawke plays the part of the gold digger Jack. The scenery is realistic, showing the great Alasca wilderness. The score is very impressing. The director also did a good job. I enjoyed this film because it is very thrilling and some parts are true. I have always had a soft spot for stories about the friendship between an animal and a human. The actors do a good job but the wolf is always at the centre of attention."
4,It Could Have Been Better,"Well, I liked the movie very much but the book of White Fang was just more detailed than the movie.Most of my friends thought the same thing.It's good but could be a little better.I LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!! wolves and if they added how it all began, such as White Fang's birth it would be more than interesting.Well, that is just my opinion.(....)"
5,White Fang,Because it was a book that you could not put down.I would recommend it to anyone who loves the outdoors and animals
3,No Widescreen??!!,"It is ""ridiculous"" not being able to get this film in widescreen--Whoever was behind the decision to mangle this movie should be firedThe beauty and scope of this White Fang as it is meant to be--and then not to be able to see-a-h-h-what else can I say.I dearly love this movie,but I will not watch it or buy it unless it is in widesceen"
5,Ethan Hawke is thwe world's best actor!,I loved this film. It was great and Ethan Hawke was excellent as he always is.
2,Not impressed,"I thought that I would like this movie becacuse of the relationship between the wolf dog and human, but I was sorely dissappointed after seeing it. I was troubled by the idea that same humans that eventually adopted the wolfdog were the ones that killed the wolfdog's mother in the first place... which was the reason White Fang was unable to live on his own to begin with. It's like the same person purposely ripping down a forest and then caging animals in a zoo and claiming to ""help"" them.Second, I know that dog fights are very brutal, but I thought the film could have been made without showing the actual dog fights (several minutes worth of dog fights are shown.)Third, the movie shows wolves as savage purposeful killers of man, which is a myth."
4,Lacks depth,* Well acted movie somehow lacks depth. * Wolf and Boy should meet earlier on in the movie...
1,Save your money,"This is by far the worst Bob documentary I have ever seen. There is no new material in this movie, the two people making commmentary about bob, obviously did not know him well. The maker of this DVD got two guys off the street, made some backdrop pictures of BOB and got some old material to put together this DVD.Please save your money. It is not worth it. Watch Time will Tell over and over or wait for something new from Tuff Gong."
5,Best Cutting Boards,"I have these cutting boards in several colors (for chicken, red meat, vegetables etc.). They are the best. They are big & heavy (which is a good thing) and the little feet really do keep it from slipping. And it's great that you can just stick them in the dishwasher when you're done. Highly recommended."
4,"Love the grips, don't like the handle","I have been searching for the perfect cutting boards all my adult life. These come close. If they would leave the hole for the handle off, I would say they would come even closer. It takes up valuable cutting space as far as I'm concerned. The grips on the back side prevent the board from sliding all over and I LOVE that feature.I also wish they came out with a small size...say 5 X 8 or so...for the little, quick jobs like slicing lemons. Would also buy a larger size if available. I usually have 3 boards in my kitchen."
2,Warped right out of the box.,"I have a smaller version of this board and love it. I got this for my daughter. It works but it's warped.Would not buy again. Too much $$ for something defective and a pain it the a@@ to send back, so I'll keep it."
4,"Right product, wrong color","I ordered grey, but received a burgundy-colored cutting board. I thought I would get used to it, but I still hate the color. So if you receive the wrong color, too, here is a word of advice: take the trouble to return it!"
3,"Great Picture, Worst sound","The picture is as clear as they come, but had I known that the sound was as bad as it is I would have bought a different tv. Other than the sound the tv is a decent buy."
4,I don't know why the other reviews are so negative,"This movie is a hybrid of Karate Kid and Rocky. It is fun, has a lot of heart and absolutely nothing offensive. Anyone who liked the Karate Kid would like this one even better; it is a much better movie.It is a great story, well told and will offend no one with inappropriate content.We came acrossed it by accident, and I'm glad we did."
4,THE KID: what to expect without ruining your watch,"The kid: In it's awesome 1990's way, it shares a timeless message about family unity, understanding, and listening to each other. The Kid may not have broken any new ground in Hollywood, but maybe that's it's greatest feat. While the movie had some cheesy moments (in my eyes), I found the overall show very entertaining. The characters are well acted out, and some you may find yourself recalling from time to time in your daily routines. In summary: It will warm the heart, and provoke a desire to box; at least for a little while."
5,nothing short of amazing,"a voice like no other, songs are beautifully written and even more beautifully delivered, even if you don't understand French this is an album you will love"
4,Feline warmth,"Very nice product, but had to open up and sew in Velcro fastener as I only wanted to heat the inner pad in the microwave."
1,In and Out Box,"The product came in perfect condition, however, there was a piece missing from the container making the trick impossible to complete. It is an unfortunate thing, but not the fault of the seller, just the manufacturer."
1,Huge disappointment!,Didn't work. Instructions didn't exPlain trick. Tried googling it without success. Many well-educated adults tried to understand written information to explain to child. Disappointment and waste of $.
4,sujata massey,"I love her Rei Shimura books, but I am very disappointed that I cannot get them all in paperback. I am NOT a kindle person!Is she still writing?"
3,A little better,"Sujata has improved slightly from the last one, more of a mystery and more interesting but the characters way to simple... more depth still needed"
2,Totally phony,The impression I get was that this book was written for effect. It is as if Massey wants to prove that she is a hard-core Washingtonite (if I may use that word). Throwing in the political angle was superflous as well - Senator Snowden - give me a break.There is no real story here - the plot about the pearl diver is just added in to connect the ramblings about the restaurant and Washington political scene.On the whole this was not a satisfying read at all.And finally why the negative review of Rei's work at the restarant? What did that achieve?
1,Read the first in the series--skip this one,"I'm not moved often to write reviews pro or con but this book was so terrible I had to act. I gave it one star because the writing is literate.I will only say that I have read all the other books in this series except the one immediately before this one. I missed it and was excited to see a new one! Alas, moving to the U.S. seems to have completely changed her personality. She has become tedious, whiny, and tentative. The plot of this novel is uninvolving and very slow to get started. The other characters, except Aunt Norie, are pedestrian.If you want exciting books about Japan, read the Isaac Adamson series with Billy Chaka or, for a slower pace and intriguing characters, the early Banana Yoshimoto. Check out Haruki Murakami. There's good stuff out there. This isn't it.Lose Hugh and send Rei back to Tokyo. Let's have some fun."
1,"I love this series, but this is the worst of the set","I love the Rei Shimura series. Rei is a smart and interesting protagonist and is usually surrounded by equally interesting characters. Something went wrong with this book. I think Massey was trying to show a different side of Rei, unhappy with where she's living and with her relationships. Rei comes off, however, as whiney, shallow, and uninteresting. Aunt Norie is the only truly interesting person in this book. The new characters are all superficial and border on off-the-shelf stereotypes. I'm really disappointed.Don't let this be your introduction to the series. Read these books in order, as events carry through the series. When you get to this one, remember that you've read MUCH better from the author."
3,Not one of her better efforts--SPOILER ALERT!!!,"I am a big fan of this series. I lived in the Tokyo area for six years and now live near the DC area. Having been to many of the places in the books makes them all the more enjoyable. I have to agree with other reviewers that I want more stories set in Japan. I understand the next in the series takes Rei back to Japan. My main gripe is the ""romance"" between Rei and Hugh. I am growing weary of their on again/off again relationship. For pity's sake! What does Rei want? Hugh is a gorgeous Scottish lawyer. He makes oddles of money and he's crazy about her. She was living with him in DC. She was pregnant with his child. She uses his car and constantly sponges off him. BUT--she can't decide if she wants to marry him??? Is it really that she just can't make herself commit or is she a glorified prostitute? Either pair them up, or write Hugh out of the series."
2,my son doesn't watch this video,"We have a handful of potty-training videos in our home and my son doesn't watch this one. While its content is good, it's not one he prefers to watch."
5,WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS NOW,"The Skin You Live In is a wonderful book for a world full of children who need to feel special and good about themselves. Everyone looks different on the outside, but the basic human is the same on the inside. This teaches children and adults with rhyme and colorful pictures, about being themselves and accepting others for themselves. WE live in a world where hate,fear and prejudice are still around. Please stop the cycle by reading to your child and instilling in him the joy of all the different children in the world."
4,Return of an old Friend!,"I bought this for my husband, who is a science fiction fan. It's a classic he read many years ago, and was delighted to see again."
1,Zigilation? This sh|t is wack,I'm 12 years old and this music is garbage. I know my hip-hop so don't come at me with the new jack sh|t. If you think this is good music you need to get chin checked.
4,Fixed Point Divider,Very Study and easy to use. The lead broke on me the other day when I was making a circle on plywood. Other than that it works well.
3,Fine if you don't want an authentic accent,"I've searched unsuccessfully to find Hebrew materials suitable for my young children to assist me in teaching them the language, and I was very excited when I came upon this item. The concept of translating familiar songs is nice, but the execution loses a lot in my eyes (or ears, actually) because they didn't bother to get speakers with native Israeli accents. It doesn't seem like it would have taken a whole lot of effort to do this and the product would have been infinitely better. If you don't mind your kids learning Hebrew with a very strong American accent, this is a good choice. Otherwise you (and I) will have to keep looking. I haven't listened to other languages in this series so I don't know if they are similarly American-accented or not."
3,"Nice Try, but . . .","I like the idea of putting common English songs into Hebrew, but I found the execution lacking. The vocals are not of good tonal quality. I don't want my children to grow up singing like the voices on this tape. Also I found it out that the transliterations in the book are different than those of the cd. It seems that there should be more uniformity than this."
3,Nothing special,"This was a story about two people who didn't trust each other enough to just let go of the past and try to find some peace and happiness. The heroine was supposed to love the hero, yet she kept him at arm's length, didn't let him touch her, didn't tell him what was wrong etc. Besides, this author obviously doesn't like her heroes - this one was shot - twice, while another hero from another book was badly beaten - also twice. This is just too much. Isn't one injury enough? I liked the part about his grandmother, though. The part about the burning house was too over the top. I think that both the hero and the heroine should trust each other more and be more honest with each other. All things considered, this was still quite a beautiful story, but it could be much better."
2,Not as good,"Heartless isn't as good as other Kat Martin books. I found the story very predictable, the plot highly unrealistic, and Ariel very annoying. I've enjoyed other books by this author so much more. I just couldn't find those enjoyable things in this book that the other reviewers did."
4,Great Book!!,"Instead of writing a long review, I'll just say that Justin and Ariel's story was excellent!! I really give this book 4 1/2 stars-it's that great!!Kat Martin is one of my new favorite romance authors. I look forward to reading more of her books."
1,Very disappointing.,This book was very boring. I couldn't get half way through it. Usually when I don't care for a book I will only read what's in the quotation marks and/or skip to the end. But I didn't even bother with this book.
3,Cat's Paw,"Three stars: Average. Though the plot was pretty predictable, in that the reader guesses from the first detailed description what the overall story arc will be. Still and all, it was an enjoyable bit of light reading, and I would read something else by this author. She did a good job of leading the reader to discover who was friend and who was foe.There was a delightful absence of grammar and spelling errors.The writing became a bit uneven toward the end, and could have used some polishing. I could almost tell the point at which the author decided to wrap things up to a conclusion. Not badly done; just a bit awkward."
1,Don't Bother,"I love quirky books that throw you off kilter with magic, science fiction, aliens, etc. Even that small aspect to this book could not save it from being too boringly descriptive."
2,Non-compelling,"I prefer mysteries that keep me guessing up to the explanation at the end, and I figured this one out by the end of the second chapter. By that time I also didn't particularly care for the main character, though I liked her older son. I found the constant references to the missing husband rather irritating, especially since the author doesn't tell us who Alexi was until his mystery-shrouded name had been sprinkled through the text five times. One reviewer liked the lack of explanations in the book, but I don't enjoy passages that make me feel like the author is trying to play games with my head. If the character doesn't know something, I'm OK with not knowing it, but pages of gloomy ""Alexi is missing"" with no explanation of who he was to warrant this attention made me grouchy. I skipped to the end to confirm my guess and didn't feel any need to fill in the missing chapters. Overall, the author uses words well, and I'm sorry that I didn't find the book more compelling."
2,Cat's Paw,"A cute story if meant for maybe 5th-8th grade readers. As an adult, I found it boring (kept falling asleep) just because Miranda was doing the same thing over and over and over, but I did enjoy the cat (figured out who she was maybe a chapter after she appeared) and the ending was heartwarming!"
3,Good story but...,Nice development of characters. Good plot but I would have liked to know more on the relation magic and the lighthouse's keepers.
3,"I read it, but wondered why.","I did make it all the way through this book, but kept thinking it was going to get better. It was interesting, but it was not a book that I rushed to pick up. I was curious enough that I kept reading until the end, but when I was finished I wondered why I had worked so hard to get to the end."
5,A Compelling Read,"I discovered this book by accident, and I'm so glad I did. Once I began reading it, I couldn't put it down. An imaginative story, simply told."
4,Interesting read,"Good story line. Predictable ending, but enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. Where the cat could have been a little more active in the sleuthing, I enjoyed the book. I do not believe that for the time setting of the book some of the things we believable. (Did people know about calcium and cholesterol back then? I do not think so."
3,slow start,"I couldn't really get into this one. I just found the introductory chapters a bit boring. I don't think it was the writing though. I just found the story not to my taste, which could just be a reflection on me. I would rather give this 2 1/2 stars but you can't do that so I had to go up to 3."
5,A great read,"There was so much about this book that I really enjoyed -- the richness of the language, the timeless setting, the interesting little details about such things as a lighthouse and a meteor to name a few. I also liked the heroine, a small town lady, who kept growing stronger as she searched for her missing husband. Also interesting was the strange cat that she took with her as she searched. I also liked the fact that the magic was more subtle than a usual fantasy. When I told my husband I was reading this book, he mentioned that he had read it a few years ago and it was one of his all time favorites."
4,Cat's Paw,"The Cat's Paw kept me intrigued by the relationship between the heroine and the cat. However, some of the mystery was answered by its title. As a result I gave this novel a four star."
3,Enjoyable,"I liked this book. It was on the short end for a novel but well written with believable characters. The main character was quite naive at the beginning, which was annoying at times but made sense in the context of the story. She was still quite likable despite that. The plot fell together well and I look forward to giving other books by this author a try."
4,well crafted story,A lovely story that draws you in and keeps you guessing. Nice character development and adventure to keep you reading.
5,Desperate to have more....,"This is a fabulous product & I've scoured to find additional. It's size is perfect for small & large alike (up to 200#). If you have a small space, but host large crowds for gathering, there's none out there that beats this little chair. It folds up almost in a ""cane"" sort of way - so it makes it extremely convenient for storage. I have two. I wish, I wish, I wish ... I would have bought more!!! I'll be on the lookout, if ever this comes back to Central Park Products, Inc. product line..."
5,Perfect for Massage Therapists,"This chair is perfect for traveling, massage therapists esp. for those working on clients in hospital beds. It's padded, so it's comfortable to sit on for an hour. It's round so it's easy to change position without moving the chair all the time. It's compact for travel and storage."
4,DIANA WAS SHOWN AS HAVING FAULTS BUT CARING FOR OTHERS.,"DIANA, HER TRUE STORY. READ THE ENTIRE BOOK AND ENJOYED IT. SHE CAME TO LIFE AS A REAL PERSON, NOT JUST A STIFF-LIPPED ROYAL WITH TITLE AND RICHES. SHE HAD A GIFT TO ENJOY LIFE AND ENJOY PEOPLE IN WHATEVER STATUS THEY WERE. ALL WERE IMPORTANT TO HER."
3,Diana: Her True Story,"I recently picked up this book on a rainy day, I finished it the same day, it is a fast read. First of all, this book is really poorly written. The writing bounces around and sentences do not flow together at all. Second, the content is appalling. Somehow this book is written to make us try to feel bad for a privileged young lady that naively married into the royal family. Instead of making the best of a bad situation, she acted immaturely and whined because things weren't going her way. Ultimately, I feel most of this book is probably packed with one-sided lies.Overall, Diana, although beautiful and iconic in her jewels and clothing (selected carefully by her wardrober, not herself of course), was just a naive high school drop out that took the best opportunity presented to her. When things didn't go her way, she made a bad situation even worse, it is ultimately tragic."
3,Good for New Players,"If you're new to Counterstrike, then this book is a pretty good bet. Lots of information to *introduce* you to concepts like podbots, scripting, control settings, etc. Some of the information is for advanced play in leagues or whatever, but if you're looking to just increase your frag count at the early stages, this will help.Yeah, some information is outdated, but the general concepts are all there, and then you can get more info from web sites, faqs, etc. Concepts listed in the book like shooting through boxes, etc aren't always obvious on the web. Yeah, you can get the same info online, but this is a nice reference with the maps and all. If you've got a couple bucks to blow, go for it.On the other hand, nothing beats experience so get out and PLAY!Later."
3,It's ok.,"Simply said, good for n00bs, no good for advanced players.I have played CS for about 4 months now, and I only learned about 2 new things. Other then that, the only things that I found helpful were the match strategies, so my team can devise ways around them, which are mainly just overpowering one route. The only people who really need this book are people who have played CS for about a week.BTW- I'm not a minor - I'm just too lazy to register ;)"
1,Counter-Strike,"The above review of OGC is BS. Sure, using OGC hacks are easy, and free, but why use them? And why buy this book? The only sure way of getting strats is to play. I have been playing CS for 3 years now, and I don't need a book to tell me how to play. When you are dead, watch the person in first place, and see what he does, then try to repeat what he did. Learn your own tactics. Just because x3 is the best clan in the U.S., does not mean their strats will help. Hope this has helped convinced you NOT to buy it."
1,Why?,"I totally agree with darkfiksta, why would you waste 20$ bucks on a strategy guide when you can learn your own?! And anyway, there are tons of sites that have more strageties than this book. Just like darkfiksta said, watch other ppl play that are good and learn from them. If anyone needs tips go look on the internet, enless you are rich and lazy."
1,how poor,ive played cs for a while now by no means long time ( about 9 months i think since cs1.1 anyway )This book is quite poor nothign usefull for anyone who can actually fire the gun and aim.The team tatics were useless Ive played many clans trying these against us and theyve lost considerably. Infact one of our best wins was 72-0 to us and it was obvious they were using this books tatics only so all we did was sit there and wait for them in the same place every timeNot worth your money just join a few pro clans servers and play against there put up with loosing and learn how they play.Like the player above saying it increased them to an 8:1 ratio pls pls pls come play against me i`ll put you in 0:negative figures
5,Fabulous book; highly recommended for all levels.,"This book works for food like Claire McCardell worked for American sportswear; mix and match, it all makes you look good, and it's not tough to pull together. Good value, spices up the dinner options easily, will impress your friends and in-laws enormously. It's enhanced by the stories that the author weaves through it, making it so much more than just a cookbook -- more of a picaresque tale of ""How I Ended Up Running A Restaurant When All I Really Wanted Was A Good Sportscar."" Highly recommended."
4,Ft Cookbook,"The cookbook is very interesting. It does have quite a few gamey recipes that I will never use - but I knew that going into the purchase, as I borrowed it from the library first -- I knew exactly what I was getting. It has fascinating recipes, good stories to go with it and some history. Anyone who is a cookbook collector would appreciate the book! Going through the book just makes me want to go to the local Fort Restaurant even more!"
5,A fine specialty cookbook,"I've had a copy of the cookbook that I bought through Amazon for a couple of years. This copy was bought as a gift for a friend who lives in the east. I thought she would enjoy having some western and southwestern style recipes... and I was right. Out of print, but there are used dealers on Amazon who have new copies at a good price."
5,Incredible Gift,The Concise Atlas of Canada was presented to me as an award and I must say that it is an absoloute beauty. It's thorough and it's maps are a work of art.
2,they ruined it,Geoffrey Matthews' and Byron Moldofsky's beautiful cartography is destroyed by the greatest error an atlas publisher can make--spreading the maps across two pages. The results are not just ugly; some information is lost in the crack.
4,A Historical Landmark in South African History,"I read this book for my course on South African History, and though it may not be very well written (English is Abrahams' second lanugage, and the prose comes off as very stiff), it is nevertheless a landmark acheivement in South African History. At the time when it was published, 1946, no book had been written about racial tension in South Africa, especially fom the eyes of a Black South African. Historically and politically a triumph, this book is as important to South Africa as ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is to the United States."
1,Perfume Emporium,"I have been using this perfume since 2004. When I saw it on line I was so happy. I ordered it and it smell nothing like the real one also the spray cap was missing. I think Perfume Emporium opened it, mixed it to make more money. I will never ever order from this company again. I returned the perfume and ask them to credit my account. I will not recommend that any one buys perfume from Perfume Emporium."
3,Technique that is not all-rounded,"Sure, Cziffra sometimes does show INCREDIBLE technique with his runs that are really smooth and contain NO ""bumps"" or accents. But I do hear faults in his technique. The Chopin Etude Op 10 no.2 in A minor is a good example. He plays it quite slow, not very clear, and uses lots of pedal to cover up the blemishes in his fingerwork. How can that be good? But some of them are pretty fine, especially the Rigoletto paraphrase."
1,Un-teaching me Math,"I come from a Physics background, so I have extensive knowledge of Differential Equations, Calculus, etc. This has to be one of the WORST books I've ever read. First of all, it's filled with almost 15 pages of ""Errata"" - including the author messing up a Taylor Series Expansion. That's ridiculous - no publisher should have allowed this book to go on the market so full of mistakes with the author so unwilling to correct them.Secondly, the book teaches you absolutely no Math at all. Half of the lectures in each chapter are obscure, random models the author picked, and suddenly is capable of making assumptions about each model that seem completely arbitrary. There is no reasoning behind half of the steps the author takes.I'm sorry, but I swear I'm becoming bad at math trying to use this textbook. Using this book is a waste of time and money. I can't wait to put it in the fireplace."
5,goofball comedy with outstanding ski footage,"Possibly the most underated comedy of the 80's, SKI PATROL is silly, stupid, funny and just plain entertaining. The scene where bad guy Martin Mull skis out of control down the slopes in a hot dog shaped food stand is worth the price of admission alone. Expertly directed by Richard Correll(Family Matters, Married with Children), this is a film you can watch over and over."
3,above average low budget comedy,"If you like screwball movies like Spring Break and Meatballs, you'll probably love this one. The ski patrol has to save the resort from sabatoge and takeover by a rival developer. Mostly no-name actors except Martin Mull, who plays the bad guy. For those who follow stand up comedy in California, you'll get a special treat when you see a young George Lopez as one of the main characters. He's pretty good in this movie but way better at a comedy club."
3,Pretty good,"I had a lot of fun watching this video, but it seems to me that I saw Pierce Bronson as one of the extras. Could that be right?"
5,"Expensive, but a great product","I first used this when i was bought a gift pack that contained this after shave balm. I keep a full beard generally but shave my head. This stuff feels soooo good on my head. It leaves my scalp so soft and smooth. I used to never use moisturizers on my head after shaving because it seems that everything would break me out. Not this stuff! I NEVER break out from using this. While the product is ""unscented"" i think it has a very wonderful, but light scent. I love the smell of it. It almost reminds me of uncooked oatmeal and cinnamon. Again...its very light and smells clean. It does not feel greasy at all and soaks into your skin quickly. It is expensive but if you want to pamper yourself, try this stuff. You don't need much so that does help offset the price."
2,Expensive and Sticky,My husband said that he doesn't like this as well as his old aftershave lotion because it feels sticky. I actually liked the very subtle smell to it when it is first applied. The scent disappears right away though.
5,An excellent reference for novice and experienced RNs,"Sheehy's Emergency Nursing is a must for any emergency nurse. I have used this book (current and previous editions) in my emergency nursing orientation program for over 12 years. It is an excellent resource for emergency nurses from novice to expert. While there are plenty of other texts available, only Sheehy's gets my vote of confidence."
2,Pamphlet from the tekno-underground,"This is an extremely short tract that weaves indiscriminately amongst legitimate (albeit math-free) science, Gilligan's-Island style improvisation (that's a toilet float atop the coil pictured on the cover), and mythical pop pseudoscience (""unlimited free energy,"" etc.).A good Google search will be far more informative, and free, too."
2,Construction notes to build a Tesla Coil,"I have reviewed this book when I first started gathering information on Tesla coil design. Much of the information can be obtained from old reprints and other sources. George has described building a Tesla coil using househould appartatus such as Tupperware containers. If you are serious about Tesla coil construction, then this manual is probably not for you. If you want a basic understanding of the Tesla coil, this manual is reasonably priced and can rest in your bookcase along with more advanced books on the subject.Again, this is one man's design and is probably not the most effecient coil you can build to give you the longest sparks, but it is a start to provide for a beginner. When I built my Tesla coil, I did not use the design information in this manual."
4,Excellent Tesla Coil resource.,With all of the designs for tesla coils circulating the internet I was curious why I should pay $10 for this book. I was pleasantly surprised. The detail and simplicity of the book make it a great beginners guide. I am using the authors general design but altering it in some ways to give it my own flair. Mine is nearly complete!!With this book you really don't need to know anything about a Tesla Coil to build one (just have some basic Algebra skills).I highly recommend it.
1,Flaky,"In this his third and ""Extensively Revised"" version the author promises to reveal ""secrets"" such as getting energy for free. Yes, he says, ""it is a real gain in power"". Actually he leaves how to do that the reader, while describing ""his"" Tesla Coil design which is so primitive by modern standards as to undoubtedly perform poorly, as further evidenced by no streamer images from it appearing anywhere in his book. A reader new to coiling would be terribly lead astray by this April Fools book.Unfortunately I know of no useful Tesla Coil book in print. Fortnately modern coilers have converged on remarkably successful designs and have generously reported their works on the web. Check out the 450 watt design by ""TeslaStuff"" that can produce 24"" streamers."
3,Kindle Version Poorly Rendered,"I purchased the Kindle version of this book to learn about the area and as a reference tool. However, the conversion to ebook format is so poorly done, that any citings MUST be verified against either the print version or through other sources. The Kindle version simply has too many errors.Otherwise, this book was an enjoyable read. Very informative and well worth the time."
4,Free pieces were DUPLO not Lego,"I realize that DUPLO is made by Lego, but it was a bit misleading when it said 40 Free Lego Bricks - I assumed they would be the smaller LEGOs, not DUPLOs. I was wrong. Still a great toy though."
5,Helpful,This video is a great introduction to operating this machine. I definitely learned some things I didn't know before and that I will use in the future!
3,"funny and ""sweet""","The orphans love living with the sheriff and are getting along fine, however his cooking leaves A LOT to be desired. When a letter comes to the house, no one can read it. Sweetness heads off to school to learn her letters and decifer the mail. And what a surprise the mail delivers! It bothers me a little that the kids think the sheriff would be better off married not because he needs someone to love but because they hate his cooking, cleaning and hygiene. The emphasis on learning to read could be stronger as well."
1,Bad Buy,"I don't see how anyone can use these phones. They are the equivalent of air tight ear plugs. The music sounded very hollow, and the plugs made me feel like I had a cold or something.A very poor choice in my opinion. I would suggest that music lovers look for buds that hang near the edge of the ear, instead of the air tight variety."
1,Dashed hopes,"The package said this jack would work with computers as well as phones, but I found that when I used it for dial-up internet service in our vacation home it was completely unstable, cutting me off every 30 seconds to 1 minute or so. Then I would have to jump through many hoops to get connected again. When I gave up on the thing and reverted to my old method of connecting by stretching a phone wire across the kitchen to get to the phone jack, everything worked just fine. I was very disappointed and had to ""eat crow"" for being so gullible as to believe the package claims without checking any further. Maybe the unit would work for a phone jack, but it sure didn't for an internet connection. My local phone company told me as much when I called them for help.GE TL86597 InstaJack Wireless Phoneline Jack"
1,"Works when it works, otherwise a non-stop headache!","I bought this to enable connecting my satellite reciever. It worked in the beginning for about a week with no problems. Then it started acting up. The extension unit would lose the connection about 2-3 times a day. Sometimes it would self-restore, sometimes needed to reset. It was a nuisance but we tolerated it. Then about a month after we bought it, it completely failed to connect. I tried all the troubleshooting tips, and even did the new channel set-up shown in the manual. I work in electronics, so I tried other ideas I knew as well. Still doesn't work. No choice left but to try and return it (and I don't have the original package either so it could be a problem). $60 down the drain :( . Don't buy it. I now am going to run a line through the walls for an extra jack!"
5,Excellent and effective product/solution!,"Even though we have high-speed internet (cable) on our main 'base' computers, we do not yet have a wireless router so we can use our notebook computer online at other remote locations in the house (we don't feel secure hooking up a wireless router- in my opinion, they are more prone to hacking and intrusion than a wired internet network). So we kept AOL and our 'dial-up' connection, and plug the 'InstaJack' remote unit into various AC outlets throughout the house, which gives us great portability for our notebook computer (even running a short line outside for patio usage). The unit works very well in this regard, and has given us no problems or issues whatsoever. Just the way technology should function! All in all, an EXCELLENT product which does what it claims. Highly recommended!"
2,Did not last,"I needed a phone connection for my dial-up internet in a remote room with no jack. This gizmo works really nicely and at a fraction of the cost of a land-line phone-company extension outlet. Easy set-up, even for a dummy like me.Update: device overheated and became useless after only 3 or 4 months."
3,"Easy Phone Jack, bulky","These are as reliable as a regular phone line, but surely the company could make them smaller these days. The size is my single complaint."
1,Does not work!,"It does NOT work, unless I am doing something wrong but it is odd that they are hard to find on the Internet so maybe they are just junk?"
3,It's ok!,"The book is very informative, but since it didn't come with the CD (as advertised) it should have at least had the blank forms in the book so you can copy them."
3,Spectra CU2051 Radiator,"Not a perfect fit. Using the radiator on a Honda CR-V, I found the height to be 1/4 inch too short. This made the weight of the radiator rest on the fan shrouds not on the lower rubber mounts. (IF you have after market plastic fan shrouds - these will bend and crack under the weight of the radiator). Also, the top posts were barely in the rubber grommets. I had to place rubber shims under the lower posts between the radiator and lower rubber grommets to get the proper fit. Everything else was correctly aligned (fan shroud brackets/nuts and hose fittings).OK fit, GOOD Price, QUALITY to be determined with time.SUGGEST Spectra to review fit and correct and/or provide shims for different car applications."
5,From within,At last an author with some real knowlage of what he is writing about. John has personal insight so that the reader can trust the advice that he or she is given in this book.
5,Urban Youth Pastor,"After over 25 years of working with at risk african-american youth i found this book to clearly denote the standards our youth must be aware of. It is imperative that urban youth workers across america make this book a reference guide in their arsenal of weapons helping our youth avoid the land mines of the criminal justice system. This is not only a must read, but a must have, and a must do."
4,Fighting for African Americans,"Having worked in Law Enforcement for a number of years, I KNOW that this book is a MUST read for everyone. Not just people of color but for all people. It will help everyone understand the inner works of the ""System"". Great work......."
2,"Interesting, but this is a home made video tour","This video hit some locations in New Zealand that were off the beaten path. But be aware, this is not a top notch professional grade tour video of New Zealand. For example, Milford Sound was not covered in any way. Neither were any of the glaciers covered.It did however show us typical weather (like the rainy days as well as the good ones) and made us realize we need to bring our rain jackets and warm clotes to New Zealand, even in the late spring. And the hostess was warm throughout.In summary, it was a bit slow, and I was expecting a much larger overview of New Zealand from this product."
4,Personal information excellent!,I liked the way B.Rathbone writes. He is sincere and very personal in his writings. Wonderful stories to hear. Colorful life with some fine people to remember.
3,"Articulate, elegant -- but not wholly satisfying -- autobiography","The world loved Basil Rathbone for both his stage and film roles, but in his autobiography he talks about them almost in passing, as though they didn't really mean all that much to him or that they just sort of happened to him without his participation. He is equally dispassionate about other experiences -- such as shooting a man dead during the First World War -- and so the reader is left vaguely unfulfilled. His thumbnail descriptions of some of his Hollywood cohorts is equally sketchy -- he made three classic, blockbuster films with Errol Flynn, for instance, and gives him all of a paragraph. There was even less for Olivia de Havilland.Yet, on the plus side, Rathbone was, admittedly, a ""frustrated writer,"" and he poured every ounce of his urbanity into this chronicle of his life. Not the best autobiography I have ever read, but certainly worth the time if you're interested in ""dear old Bazzzzzz,"" as Flynn called him."
3,"About Mr.Rathbone , not so much Mr.Holmes","Basil Rathbone glosses over his most famous role as Sherlock Holmes in this book . It is mainly concerned with his other works , his early life and his extensive stage career . But it includes some interesting photos of the early Hollywood years and makes interesting reading for fans of the Golden era ."
4,Angels in the Outfield,"Our family loves baseball and just about all baseball movies, so this is a great family friendly baseball movie to add to our collection"
4,Baseball fans,of all ages will enjoy this movie. I purchased it for my 8 y.o. grandson and he was delighted.
5,a baseball great,this is about a boy that see's angles and helps the baseball team out. i have always been a fan of this movie. they go from crap to champs. there is really nothing in this movie that is bad for kids.
4,Two Thumbs Up!,"Although I wouldn't say 5 stars, this is a really great movie. Wow! What can I say? I've watched this movie around 7 times and it just doesn't get old. It's great! I don't usually cry when I watch movies, but this is one movie I cry when I watch (the happy sort of cry). The ""angel scene where everyone stands up at the end (whatever you want to call it)"" is really moving. It's especially good for baseball fans. You really feel the excitement."
4,Good Baseball Movie,"This is a good baseball movie, but I thought this was rated PG for mild language, and the only langunage I heard was ""Jackass."" This movie is good but there are other baseball movies like ""BASEketball"" staring Trey Parker, and Matt Stone, and ""Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch."" I give this 4 stars."
3,watch the original instead,"I enjoyed this movie, but I have to say that I still prefer the original. Although you didn't get the special effects in the original, the story and acting were much better and you didn't have the cheesy arm flapping scenes."
5,Angels in the Outfield,I was very happy with the delivery of this item. I ordered it on Wednesday and asked for 2 day delivery but it came the next day.
5,purchase of used movie,The used DVD we purchased was in excellent condition and arrived in 4 days. I will use this service again!
1,"Disney, What Did You Expect?","This movie is not funny (unless you like to watch people to fall down), it's not charming, it's not warm, it's not good. Like most movies of their genre, the acting is very second rate. I could only see liking for nostalgic reasons. The same recycled plot really doesn't capture anything here. The Disney machine cranks out another loser."
2,Pretty sappy stuff,"Foster-child Roger (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) prays for the California Angels to win the pennant in the mistaken belief that it will lead to reconciliation with his father (Dermot Mulroney). Angels begin to intervene on the Angels' behalf, bringing hope, faith, and a renewed sense of self-worth to bitter manager George Knox (Danny Glover) and his clumsy team. Diabetics should avoid this film at all costs. It goes for easy sentimentality every step of the way, leading to a very predictable outcome. Kids may like it, though I don't want to be the one to explain why God would pick sides in a sports contest, especially since He and His angels ought to be well aware that answering Roger's prayers will not lead to the outcome he so desperately desires. Oh well, if you can put your brain on hold and get misty-eyed over a stadium full of spectators flapping their arms like angels, you ought to have a good time."
5,Great gift-bad image,"The ironing board was great-just didn't know you had to buy iron separately. It shows both in image for board only and ONLY if you scan down-which some of us don't, does it say sold separately. Company did make good by shipping it to us for free and charging a $1.00 less for iron. NIce customer service."
4,Disney Princes,Muy buen producto todo llego a tiempo y de la forma esperada. El vendedor es serio y cumple con lo ofertado
5,LOVE AT A YOUNG AGE,"THIS BOOK IS MY FAVORITE OF THE DONALD GOINES COLLECTIONS. WHY BECAUSE THE STORY IS SO SINCERE ABOUT TWO YOUNG PEOPLE MAKING IT, WHEN PEOPLE THOUGH THEY WOULDNT. THEY WHERE IN LOVE AND THEY SHOW IT FOR EACH OTHER WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT. THE WERE TRULY THE URBAN LOVE STORY. BORN POOR BUT NOT COUNT OUT. I JUST FEEL THIS TWO MAIN CHARACTERS THROUGH OUT THE BOOK."
4,nappygyrl,"My bestfriend bought this book for me about 3 years. I was so engrossed I wouldn't put it down till I was finished. What I find so amazing about Donald Goines books is that they were writen back in the 70's, but the situations are still prevalent today. You can look in any city; NYC, PHILLY, CHI-TOWN, LA... there's still dealers, addicts, whores, pimps. We are still hungry. Hunger makes us angry."
3,So So read..,"This book was not very good, I've never heard of this author but after reading the reviews and seeing the price..I decided to give it a go. The book moves fast..maybe too fast..pretty bland and boring really too fast. If I would've know the book was originally published in 1973 I wouldn't have ordered it, a lot of the terms in the book really let you know that it was written over 30 yrs ago. Wouldn't recommend you buy this book, it's a so so read...but not one for keeps."
2,Boo!,"Most everyone else liked this book but I did not. To me it was unrealistic. At some points it was hard for me to get off of one page because it was so boring. And the way she called Chink, ""Daddy"" was kind of corny. Yeah the pain and the love between the characters was understood, but maybe this book could have been written better. So i guess im in the minority here but I would not recommend this book to anyone. To me it wasnt worth reading (sorry David Goines).Also, in my opinion, there is no way that this book compares to The Coldest Winter Ever by Sister Souljah. That's the book right there!"
3,No Depth,"I found Black Girl Lost to not be up to Donald Goines first two books, ""Whoreson"" and ""Dopefiend"", in that it did not delve deeply enough into why and how the girl was abandoned to the life she led. The books seems to have simply been hammered out to 'get it done' and then move on to the next book. While Donald Goines is, without a doubt the best of the black genre writers of his time, this book does not come up to his usual writing.C. R. Melcher"
4,Sad story,I enjoyed this short read. I felt bad for the caracters in the end. They found love only to loose it in a tragic way. Too many young kids get overlooked because they have a bad upbringing. The parents should have some type of punishment for the way the children are mistreated. However that's no excuse for crimes done by the children. Excessive force by the police department. That's the way the GETTO is!
3,A gift.....,I was told he enjoyed this book! Not a book that would interest me; however it was a big hit with my brother!
5,I couldn't put the book down until I was finished.,"Black Girl Lost is the second book that I've read by Goines. I was really turned on to Goines after Whoreson and Black Girl Lost was just as good as that book. You can see the impact that Goines has on young African Americans because one rapper named Nas, has written a wonderful song called Black Girl Lost, except it has more of a ninety's theme. I've read all except five books written by Goines."
5,I loved this book with a passion!,"Donald Goins is one of the few Authors that can make me wanna stay up all night and read his books. I just learned about the Author a couple of years ago and I try to spread the word about his true tales of the ghetto. Black Girl Lost was so vivid, its almost as if he was writing about someone from my old neighborhood..."
5,The streets 101!,This is the first Donald Goines book that I have read and I read it in six hours flat! I mean I couldn't put the book down. I feel that this book speaks the truth about the urban community and people can relate or have seen things like explained in the book. This book gives you good visual details and is straight to the point! If you are looking for a good read this is definitely the one.
5,THE BOMB,"I am 14 yrs. old and this book was one of the many books that you can actually feels this person pain.This book is very moving and can reach different people in different ways. It might make you think about how much better you have it in this crule world. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is looking for love,heartbreak and youthfulness in a story."
5,Black Girl Lost,"Black Girl Lost is a story about a young girl named Sandra. Sandra's mother name is Sandra but people call her Sandie to seperate there names. Sandie is a drunk and she doesn't take care of her daughter. Sandra basicly raised herself, feed herself,and dressed herself. Sandra got her food and clothes by stealing them. Until Sandra was thirteen and she was offered a job and then she stop stealing. Sandra starting dating a boy name Chink and they were living together. Chink sold drugs to take care of Sandra and him.I recommand people to read the book Black Girl Lost because it is a very good book. And people also don't realize what they have. People need to remember that there is always somebody in a worst situation then you. I think that if others read this book they will have a much better understanding of life"
2,Not what I expected,"I see that my review is not like the others. I didn't like this book. This was the first book that I have read by Donald Goines and I don't care for his writting style. Some parts of the book was elementry.I do like the so-called ""ghetto luv"" books, but this one did not grab me."
4,A love story through the eyes of Donald goines,Not quite as good as dopefiend but stilla pretty darn good read. it's a love story about Sandra and chink a pair of star crossed lovers on the run. That's all I'll say about that without revealing the rest of the plot. But this is standard Donald goines fare here. Very quick reading an exciting story and two characters that you really have empathy for. A good quick enjoyable read that should please Goines fans.
4,"Don't be sad, little stars.",This cd is such a treat. The Sad Little Stars are in posession of some ginormous talent and creativity! You will not be sorry you gave it a listen. It is particularly charming that they have included some analog pops and hisses to give their music a sense of nostalgia.
5,Fascinating page-turner,"Bragg leads the reader along on a fascinating journey through time in The Adventure of English. A ""must read"" for those interested in the derivation of the terms and words we speak."
2,Good text on history of English,"This is a good ""scholarly"" text about the history of the English language. If you're interested in the history of English, this is a good read. However, the book would benefit from some illustrations, diagrams or other graphics to help convey the message and make it more interesting."
4,Not your teacher's English,"Melvin Bragg is some kind of wonderful. He gets down to the nitty gritty about the English language and its ridiculously complicated history. First the indigenous people, then the Romans, then the Anglo-Saxons/Danish/Vikings, then the French, then the...tired yet?I love the study of words and the history of how language grows, so this book is a treasure trove. English is the language with the most number of words, as if anyone was counting. It takes on anyone and anything and breeds new words or treats old words in a new way every day -- texting, tweets, sexting, the tebow -- for example.So, if you are a lingo wanderer like me, this is a great book.Liz7bee"
5,probably the best book of its category,"Written with highest precision, yet concise in delivery of information covering most topics of hematology. Illustration are diverse and clear, graphics-tables are easy to follow and understand. This is the best book I have came across for a visual illustration of hematology. Though this edition should, in my opinion be updated, but overall highly highly recommended for students or experts alike."
3,David Arquette is a study in facial expressions,The movie isn't much to shout about. The only thing which sustained my interest was David Arquette's acting and very expressive face. I think David can do more with his face than most actors can with their bodies.
4,THE ALARMIST!,"""The Alarmist"" is a BLACK COMEDY starrting STANLEY TUCCI as Heinrich Grigoris, a corrupt security system salesman who BREAKS INTO HOMES to drum up new business! DAVID ARQUETTE is his naive new employee who falls for new customer KATE CAPSHAW! This movie is based on KEITH REDDIN's play ""Life During Wartime""! This 1998 film is directed by Evan Dunsky! This is not a big comedy, but if you are fans of Tucci's acting, dollars to donuts you will get some measure of enjoyment out of watching this one! Plus, the TITLE is such a SUBTLE PUN!"
2,less than expected,At first I was satisfied with the second one I received ( the first one came broken due to poor mfg packaging ) but after short time the neck broke when popping the stopper in. All in all I'd have to conclude cheap price poor quality glass.
5,Nice functional decanter,"I ordered this decanter in order to decant a couple of bottles with degraded corks. I was looking for something attractive and inexpensive. This decanter fit the bill. It is nice looking, and has a seal around the stopper to keep air out. I was a bit worried when I received the box as I heard glass clanging around. There was no packaging around the glass. Fortunately it was the stopper clanging against the body, and there was no damage done. You really can't go wrong, it's simple, inexpensive, and attractive."
4,Great decanter for the price!,"The decanter arrived on time and in great condition. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because, like other reviewers, I found the packing material was not sufficient. Nothing was broken, but to hear things rolling around clinking together doesn't give the best impression. It's a great product for the price. I would definitely buy this again!"
5,Beautiful Decanter,This is a gorgeous decanter that sits on my kitchen counter all the time. The size is great and the stopper seals super tightly. Recommend.
2,"I can't rate, not arriving as anticipated!","I can't rate item as it's not been delivered!Looked at tracking and was surprised to find out package was damaged in transit and returned. I was expecting it for Christmes, anticipated date of deliverly was 12-20-2010, would have liked to know from the seller, not UPS, there was no way it was coming!!"
5,Fits the bill perfectly,"I never realized how difficult is was to find a decent, affordable wine decanter until I started looking for one in the department store chains and on their websites. So thank you Amazon for helping me out! This wine decanter was purchased for my parents who discarded of their old decanter because the cork seal on the stopper had deteriorated. We are pleased with the style and size of the bottle. It shouldn't be too difficult to clean and the plastic seal on the stopper won't dry out like cork does. And for the price, I felt that I couldn't go wrong. As someone else stated, it holds a full 750 ml bottle of wine. If you buy jug wine, this is easy to fill and is a lot more manageable to pour from. I'm glad I decided to purchase two."
1,no lid! arrived with only bottom part,"even though product description on Amazon page says WITH STOPPER and reviews mention one, mine came in a box with NO STOPPER and the box says ""one piece"" on it. Will have to go through pain in the you know where and return it. grrr"
3,Decanter,"This is a good decanter for ines that need to breath for a period before dringling. The decanter is not fancy, but has a classic apperance and does the job."
1,Incomplete!,"What kind of album calls itself ""the singles"" and then doesn't include all the singles? I'm not talking about their early material like ""Spellbound"" or ""Hong Kong Garden"" since those are on the earlier compilation, but this doesn't have the single ""Song from the Edge of the World,"" which isn't on any album, and it doesn't have the superior studio version of ""Last Beat of My Heart"" either... this should have been a double CD, which could have included *all* their singles from the beginning, with room for remixes and B-sides, too."
1,"What happened to ""spellbound""?","Walked into my favourite record shop to see what stuff has been re-issued, as I love my 70's and 80's. My eye's lid up to see a ""Siouxsie & The Banshees"" greatest hits sitting on the shelf. My hand races out to pick it up in full anticipation of finding my favourite punk tune on there; ""spell bound"", and ugh!, I couldn't believe it. This group finally releases a greatest hits here in Australia, and the best song is not even on it. As good as a hot chocolate in winter, without the chocolate??."
3,Chronicling the Decline....,"This shows how the midperiod Banshees (i.e. right after where ""Once Upon a Time"" left off) were still stellar, but hit a snag post-""Peek-a-boo"" and crashed and burned with the ""Superstition"" material (""Kiss Them For Me"" wasn't bad, but....) And, as pointed out earlier, NO ""Song From The Edge of the World""! Maybe a ""Thrice Upon a Time"" (w/ ""Song"" and other non-LP single and B-sides) would do the trick."
5,Classic punk/new wave collection,"I bought her lps back in the day. Wow. A trip down memory lane. And I find I like her more today...hear new things in her music. So talented...compared the [...] on the radio and in the cd racks. Good pedigree too as connected to Sex Pistols and the Cure. If you like good English rock/punk with original vocals, start here!"
5,The Best of Howard Keel,"I am very happy to have this C.D. Howard Keel does a wonderful job singing lovely songs! I especially liked ""Memory"" and ""Born Again."""
3,Howard Keel's,"Howard's undeniably smooth vocals shine on this CD. I was, however, disappointed to see nothing from the film ""Calamity Jane' on there. ""Send in the Clowns"" uis absolutly wonderful. His thick voice makes this CD what it is and that is lovely"
1,monster size streaking,HelloI have a LED tv size 37 panasonic . The screen has some dirty areas at bottom . OK went to store purchasedthe Monster flat screen cleaner and special microfibre rag...Proceed to clean screen and its streaking and worsethan before ...never again I will only use distilled water and apple cider vinegar...
3,FlatScreen cleaning kit,When I received this item I didn't think it was small. I guess that's what you get for the price.
1,Use big words if you've got nothing to say.,"Absolute drivel. Here's the opening shot from the chapter ""Communication as Communicability"" by Briankle ( a male name) Chang: ""How does one begin to question Communication? More fundamentally, how can one not begin?"" It heads straight downhill from there. On the up side, page 103 has perhaps the most spirited collection of invented academic terminology that I've seen since undergraduate days, so if you're a collector of that sort of thing, this text is a must-have. Other than that, purposeless. The contributors to this collection of essays are stealing their paychecks."
5,Waterford Kilbarry 18/10 Stainless Steel 5-piece Placesetting,"I looked over the bridal registry of several friends who were getting married, and they had chosen the Waterford Kilbarry Stainless Steel flatware. I love my own stainless steel flatware, and it has lasted and looked so nice for years, so I knew, right away, that I wanted to purchase this for them for their wedding. However, with the economy greatly affecting my budget and spending habits, I decided I was not able to buy this as a gift from the department store where they were registered. It was too pricey. Just out of curiosity, I checked on Amazon and found it for considerably less, so I purchased it. Not only was I thrilled with my purchase, but the bride and groom were equally as thrilled with their lasting gift!"
5,Baseball History Comes Alive,"In his usual, thorough and mesmerizing manner, Stanton takes us thru the times of one of baseball's true heroes. Aaron emerges at once a hero AND a normal man with wants, fears and determined expectations lived under the canopy of the race issue. This book is one that is easily read because Stanton makes the progression to the final home run go swiftly. But he includes statistics and surprises which make each page worth the close scruitiny required if a reader is to get the full meaning of Hank Aaron's life and his importance to America's Game. This is a book I'm saving for my young grandson to read and before he is old enough to appreciate it's impact, I'm going to enjoy reading it again!"
5,"""Christmas Love""","This is one of the best Christmas CD's available. The songs John choose for this CD are some of my favorites. I like all 15 songs and especially love the title song, ""Christmas Love"". The words are beautiful and so moving. I cried the first time I heard it. Another song that really touched me is ""Sleep Little Baby"". Both of these songs really touch my heart and reach to the core of my spirit.John's voice is so pleasing and comfortable to listen too. He sings with such joy and it really comes through his music. Each time I listen to ""It's Christmas Time"", I say, Yes! He sings what is in everyone's mind and heart.Everytime I listen to this CD it makes me feel like it is Christmas Day everyday of the year. I absolutely love it!"
5,Found it passing through in Sumner Washington!!..,"What a stroke of LUCK!!! My FAVORITES, all on one CD and even one that Del Way wrote and Del just won NEW ENTERTAINER of the year award and also, SONG WRITER of the year. This guy Harrison can sing! What a 'rich' voice and you can actually understand the vocals..."
5,A Wonderful Christmas Album,The Christmas Love CD - which I feel is one of the best Christmas album ever recorded - Is Great. It Just Adds That Wonderful Feeling at Christmas
5,Some Christmas Love for Everyone!,This CD offere a Great mixture of Christmas Sounds; Beautifully done Classic Carols and Lively Secular Tunes that all are able to enjoy! I also enjoy the mix of Old & New Songs on this CD.
3,Interesting tale of Roman Britain,"This is an enjoyable story set in Roman Britain. While the dialogue of this book (originally published in the mid-1950's) sometimes reads more like the script of ""Leave it to Beaver"" rather than language one might attribute to Romans and Britons, it is a fun story to read. The Druid religion and the lives of people in Roman legions and in Britain itself are stereotyped to an extent, but that does not prevent one from enjoying this romantic adventure tale."
3,Perfect Book Still Sealed.,"This book is much harder to use than previous editions, but it is what is required for the course."
3,Wrong Picture,"When I click on the picture to get a closer look, the enlarged picture displayed is of the 4th edition textbook not the 6th."
2,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY,I spent 45 bucks on this book and it was a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY...It is hard to follow and I am a second year nursing student and no stranger to the dreaded Careplans! I keep going back to the Springhouse 5th edition book that I bought last year now that is a good nursing diagnosis reference manual. This book is going to sit on the shelf and collect dust and cobwebs when that 45 bucks could have went to some thing more constructive..like my tuition!
4,confusing format,"I have to agree with the several reviewers below who said this book is confusing. I'm only a first-year student, but so far this book, which was required for class, has been absolutely useless to me.***REVISED REVIEW***I've graduated from nursing school now and entered the working world. In school, I finally figured out how to use this book efficiently, and it was useful. I never did get sold on the nursing diagnosis scheme this book relies on, and I've never made use of a nursing diagnosis in the hospital setting except to fill out busywork paperwork that nobody refers to.If you buy this book for school, you should be able to get away with a used older edition for cheaper cost. Orient yourself to the book for a while before getting into care planning. Then use the book and don't sweat the small stuff. You need to get through school, but basic pathophys, pharm, and getting the most out of clinicals are the important things for post-school life."
4,Very Useful!!,Book came in great condition and very helpful. Was a bit slow arriving but did make it within time frame. Which shouldn't have been hard since they gave me a ten day time frame....
2,did not help me,"this book is not helpful at all,its hard to follow,index and content not well organized,information inside of it is not useful,rationales and nursing intervention are lazily written .i ended up going back to using the internet as a form of patient research.at least i got it for cheaps"
1,not the same as the regular,"I ordered the Metal Edition Rocabar fragrance and was very disappointed. I have worn Rocabar for years and thought I would purchase the special metal edition but when it arrived it smelled like a cross between a wet dog's cedar chip bed and one of those pine tree car air fresheners. Just horrible. The return people were nice enough I guess but after the 15% restocking fee and shipping, I was out over $20.00. I think I will do most of my fragrance shopping IN STORE from now on."
1,Never received,"I can tell you much about Hermes rocabar(2) that I ordered through amazon because I never received them all I can tell ya Hermes makes very good products , cause I have 3 other Hermes colognes and all are very good"
5,One of the best chance scenes,"Forget the French connection. The chance scene in this movie, watching the Audi S8 tear through those narrow streets was great. Also some great Deniro action!"
5,Plenty of twists and turns,"This was a pleasant surprise - a great action flick with twists and turns in the story as well as the awesome car chases. De Niro and the rest did a great job. The DVD quality is excellent, with the widescreen captivating (adding to the excitement of the car chases). Includes a feature-length audio commentary by the director, always a plus in my book! Recommended!"
3,Not what was described.,"Only one side of the dvd worked, and the other side played for only around 15 minutes until it died. I have no problems with my other dvds or the player itself.Kara Bradley"
3,"Not good but still better than ""Analyze this""",I bought this DVD because my appartment is in the movie. And now that is the only reason I will keep this. Jean Reno is good but still his French accent at the end of the movie is bothering. It sounds childish. The car chase was well-done but that's it. The story is predictable and too many people died without necessity. I did not feel good after watching this DVD.
2,Disappointing,Yet more proof that it takes more than a great cast to make a great movie. De niro puts in his most unremarkable performance yet opposite the comatose Jean reno. A superb car chase is just about all that this film has to offer.
3,"Numbingly violent, plot hard to follow","I really had trouble following the plot of this movie, and I think it's because it bored me. It's somewhat off-putting when the stars of the film don't seem to have any values to speak of, nor respect for human life. What I took away from this film was a sense of puzzlement over how money could become more important to someone than the value of another person. Very violent and depicts many civilian, bystander casualties without portraying any regrets or consequences whatsoever.I gave it three stars because of the stylish car chase scenes and the fact that DeNiro was in it."
2,not a lot of story line,I think it's a nice movie if you like car chase and shooting. I personaly like a nice sorry as well.
2,Ronin- yawn,"I have to admit - I bought this for the car chase. I didn't expect much as a movie, so in that sense, my expectations were met. Robert De Niro is Robert De Niro - always enjoyable to watch but ""What's a nice actor like you doing in a movie like this?"" The characters generate no sympathy. The story is an inventory of cliches and formulas. As for the car chase, I was not impressed. To be fair, it may have been better on a full movie screen in a real theater. But the story seems like so much filler between the car chase and all the flying blood and bullets. Even ""guy flicks"" need some emotional intelligence."
1,I still don't know what they were all after .........,Can anybody tell me what's in the case? I mean people were killing each other like flies over this silvery case which was supposed to contain -- a pair of ice skates????!!!! Gimme a break!
3,meh,"this was kind of dissapointing, but i had pretty high expectations. it didn't really do anything wrong, but dispite a lot of action, it wasn't the most interesting movie."
4,DeNiro and company in a nice spare action thriller,"If you like films that grip you from start to finish and have very little dialogue then you'll like this European thriller directed by a master of the genre, the late John Frankenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate;Black Sunday). Not mentioned in other reviews of this film is that the script is ghost-written by playwright David Mamet under the name of Richard Weisz. Also I believe that the ghost of the great noirist director, Jean Pierre-Melville hovers over this unique film. DeNiro is fine as always as the key protagonist and he's backed by Jean Reno (The Professional;Crimson Rivers), Steller Skargsgard, Natascha McElhoe, Sean McBean, Michel Lonsdale (Day of the Jackal)and Jonathan Pryce. Full of car chases and double crosses plus the ""McGuffin"", this slick action film is one great chase reminscent of the great Steve McQueen action flicks of the 60's and 70's."
4,They are not heroes,"The main charcters in the movie are not supposed to be heroes, as the reviwer from Australia writes. Despite the fact that one is a CIA agent (I won't say who), the recovery of the contents of the briefcase outweigh any civilian loses. In addition, the people who are responsible for the deaths (The ones who shoot in crowds, and drive the cras) are the mercenary characters, not the goverment agents. I love movies where the main characters are NOT heroes...it gives movies much more new emotions and actions to explore.Ronin is a fine Friday night movie."
4,It's a keeper!,"I saw Ronin at the theater when it first came out and have been waiting for the DVD. I was disappointed that there weren't more special features. However, the movie itself was worth the cost ($17.99 at Sam's). I like to think of it as the thinking man/woman's action film. The car chases were spectacular and didn't fill in for the lack of plot elsewhere."
1,"been there, done that--better","I could write on this movie at great length, except I can put it more succinctly--this has been done many times before, by many different people, in many different styles and they are ALL so much better done that you shouldn't bother with this one. Great cast--makes you wonder what the producer had on them to make them waste their time (and ours) on this.Biggest plot device to keep us in suspense--don't tell us anything about anything!Biggest surprise at the end--none!Least surprise--what was in the case they have all been chasing since the get-go. Not even the writer could figure out anything that would make sense, so they NEVER come up with anything!!!Find anything else to watch and go for it--don't bother with this. Not worth it--even to see DeNiro."
4,Classic Frankenheimer action.,"This movie has the best car chase ever captured on film. The movies was full of action, and also had a quality story. Well writen and directed. De Niro is as good as usual and Jean Reno casted perfectly for his part."
5,greattttttt,this movie is one of the best action movies ever made i mean the part where takes the bullet outy of hisself speaks for the whole movie
3,"Great action, forgettable characters","I enjoyed the European feel to this film greatly. It had far greater depth to it than most of the ""i can make something explode most fantastically than you"" action films that are out there today. Character development was subtle yet effective for the DeNiro, Reno and McElhone characters. The other characters were either forgettable or an annoyance, and therefore it was not surprising they were either discarded, irrelevant or perished. The car chases were great, but during the greatest of them all I was tempted to hit fast forward, I had had enough. The conclusion was OK, but contained no deep or exciting twists. If even more attention was paid to the DeNiro/Reno relationship it could have made for a more poignant film, but all things considered, I've seen far worse movies lately."
3,"Worth watching for the chases, not story","It's a sort of james-bondish story, simplistic and formulaic. However, the car chases are unreal. Shot using european formula one drivers on french roads, I would rate the car chase footage as just short of Bullitt and slightly surpassing the French Connection. Best movie of all time? nahh. Worth buying on DVD? oh, yes."
2,...But the car-chases are nice...,"I can't believe people calling this movie 70's-like; it's just as fast as any of the newer Bond movies. And that's precisely why I was disappointed by it being so ""current"", after all. After reading all these great things about it - pre-MTV, slow pace, the setting, downbeat ending, talky, etc. - I thought here might finally be a movie different from the bulk of recent action flicks. But no. Sure, the colors are subdued and they may talk a lot, but here's where the misunderstanding begins. Just 'cos they talk more (which in retrospect, I'm not even sure they do all THAT much), doesn't necessarily mean it's a slow movie. -There's one vital thing which distinguish the 70's from the 90's: the editing. The makers of ""Ronin"" just didn't dare to slow that down, I guess. -In fear modern audiences might fall asleep, no doubt. How very boring."
1,Will they take a brick of gold in exchange?,This price is beyond belief! I'd be interested in meeting the person who buys the first one on here!
2,Ronin was Over-Rated,Man....I tried to watch this movie twice...fell asleep both time....it's boring and over-rated...shame in the great Robert De Niro...
2,Something is wrong!,"This movie had all the elements of success: nice story, great drive chase, good acting and elite actors... but still all together doesn't fit. I still can't figure out why.But maybe (I said maybe) this type of movie belongs to a younger generation of actors...I know it's a good movie but there's something that affected it that I couldn't figure out what it is."
5,Foreign Copy from UK,"The price on this is high because it is, in fact, an imported release from the UK.For those who are interested, it is region free and WILL play on US Blu-ray players.MGM has yet to give a date on when this will be released in the US, but apparently that date is pending."
5,Best Car Chase Ever,"Yes the chase scenes are awesome but so is the acting and storyline,the double-crosses will keep you on the edge of your seat.Although some of the crashes look staged it's because no CGI was used,all of the stunts in this film are real.The version I own is the 1999 release.The disc is a DVD-10 with fullscreen on one side and the widescreen version on the other,the PQ is very good for a 10 year old film.The DVD has plenty of extras and it has commentary by the director."
1,Mind numbingly boring - a real chore,"This film conforms to the action genre and is formulaic from start to finish. De Niro again successfully provides proof that his acting carrer is coming to an end. I was confounded by Jean Reno's performance, he was hilarious in Les Visiteurs and Rosanna's Grave, a convincingly trechorous villian in Mission Impossble and an uneducated unsocialised assasin in Leon; yet his thespian projection in Ronin was neither interesting nor accurate and unfortunately for all concerned - explosions can not compensate for a unimaginative script. The direction of this celluloid nightmare was obvious from the opening credits, its just unfortunate that the director did not have an accident to stop 'this' career changing project - he may never work again, hopefully!"
2,yawnin.,"If you love nonstop car chases through the streets of europe, shootouts, and backstabbing this is your movie. There's not much depth here, very little plot. Very long, and actually quite boring. You wait for the payoff and never get it. Watch Italian Job instead."
2,Comedy of epic proportions,"The term sharpshooter can refer to several different things:* For the standard usage, see Marksman* For the insect, see Sharpshooter (insect)* For the wrestling submission hold, see professional wrestling* For Jean Reno's renowned role as Vincent, see Ronin"
3,DeNiro can't save this one,"This is a mediocre action movie with 2 redeeming attributes. Deniro's performance as a jaded tough guy ex-CIA spy who has a world weary-Seen it all attitude that he carries off very well and a couple of incredible car chases through Nice and Paris.The plot is pretty standard spy movie stuff, some of the dialogue is contrived and wooden tough guy stuff and Natascha McElhone as the woman leading this operation is absolutely miscast and awful. Her delivery at times is almost comical it's so off."
3,only sound and chase,"If you want to watch incredible chase scenes and hear perfect sound, buy this dvd and wait nothing more."
1,"Wait for February 24, 2009","DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION OF RONIN. Just wait a few more weeks for February 24, 2009, the official U.S. blu-ray version of this movie is going to be release. I do not know why Amazon has not updated their website to pre-order this movie considering that you can do so online with Best Buy, Circuit City, and Frys. So just wait, do not buy this one, plus the new and official U.S. version is about half the price of what Amazon is currently selling this edition at. Again, just wait for February 24, 2009."
4,before it time,With films of this type being so popular now here's one from a few years back that can stand up with the modern genre.
5,De Niro,"An excellent movie, with memorable performances by a number of great actors, starting with Robert De Niro, but also jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgard, and Sean Bean."
4,One of the best car chase scene's I've ever watched,"Critics rave about the car chase scenes in The French Connection, and Bullit.... I still think the primary one in Ronin, stands head and shoulders above the rest. De Niro stands out as he always does, but some of the supporting roles, are very well done.This is one of those rare action/suspense films, that you will want to watch again and again over the years."
4,A Smart Thriller,"This is a great blend of both action and drama. Robert DeNiro and Jean Reno deliver great performances as freelance spies hired to retrieve a mysterious silver case. Director John Frankenheimer shoots some very realistic car chases and shootouts. In his Director's Commentary (DVD edition) Frankenheimer says the chases were filmed at speeds in excess of 100mph and he had British SAS soldiers do consulting for the ambushes and shoot-outs.While it may sometimes bore those with very short attention spans, the acting and well written script keep the film moving even when there is no action. If you are looking for a drama with great action, you can't do much better than Ronin."
2,Ronin - Japanese edition,I love this movie - especially watching the S8 used in the chase scenes but there are subtitles in Japanese that I can not turn off (might be able too if the set up was not all in Japanese. Get the US version that is out now.
3,A-tisket a-tasket,"I almost always enjoy Jean Reno's work. But. Rarely do I enjoy Robert De Niro. I wasn't certain if I was going to like this movie at the onset so I wasn't surprised when I found I didn't really care one way or another when it reached its rather disappointing conclusion. I just sat there and thought....so what? Two fantastic car chases do not make a good movie, especially when wedged in between a rudimentary caper flick involving a metal case that could contain anything from a bomb to dirty laundry, the contents are never revealed. I have the suspicion that they didn't know what to put in this mystery case that would justified the cons and double crosses and all the forced urgency, so they decided nothing would do just as well as something. The sad thing is I really didn't care what was in this case (worth killing and dying for) as it is not a movie I will ever watch again. Not a keeper in any case."
3,Watchable,"If not for De Niro and Jean Reno, I wouldn't have imagined what the movie would have been. The plot was almost predictable. Sean Bean added some colour to the movie. The action sequences weren't exactly fantastic although I will have to give the writers some credit for executing some rather clever parts in the movie. Still worth watching though."
3,Not bad - I expect better from DeNiro though...,The plot was ok but overall the movie was kind of dry. Not what I would expect from DeNiro.
5,"ROBERT DE NIRO IS GREATEST AGAIN AFTER "" HEAT ""","What more words to say DeNiro is the best brilliant star to enter crime movies like "" Ronin "" and "" Heat "". NOBODY DOES IT BETTER !"
4,Worthy of my name,A great combination of mystery and action. My compliments to the director on the car chases.
4,Classic action,"Robert de Niro always making the cool roles... if you wanna watch a cool movie from the undergrounds this is for you. I think i bought my Audi just beacause of this movie, really nice marketing strategy from these guys. The S8 would be always at the top of cool cars ever needed for a getaway. If you are not into action, dont even consider this movie."
4,Great Movie!,This is a classic we really enjoy watching over and over.. so had to get the Blu-Ray! The actors in this movie have made it big and when you watch this movie you will see why!
4,What does the Blu-Ray cost so much?,Love the movie. Can someone please tell me why this is so expensive on Blu-ray? Does it come in a gold plated box or something? Thanks!
1,completely uninspiring,"I was anxiously waiting to receive this dvd in the mail. I was quite dissapointed. It was confusing, boring, slow moving and had some car chases. Big deal. So did Bullitt and that was a lot better. DeNiro spouted lines from Heat, which I wish would come out on dvd already. This was a big waste of time. Don't bother."
4,A terrific action film with a great cast,"I originally saw this film in theatres, and when I saw it on home video it lost some of its cinematic edge. So I must recommend: get the widescreen version. You won't be disappointed. This is as slick of an action film as there is. It definitely harkens back to the days of ""Bullitt"" and ""The French Connection."" De Niro is his usual terrific self, but the supporting cast is equally memorable. John Frankenheimer has fully compensated for ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" (although no one could possibly save that Marlon Brando clunker) with a masterfully-directed film that boasts extraordinary action sequences. You can tell he's a veteran of his craft, and his pairing with De Niro is top-notch. The chase scenes are some of the greatest ever caught on film, and it's great to see De Niro kick some a** as an ex-CIA agent. Be careful with that rocket launcher, Bobby."
2,BAD JOB ON SOUND EDITING,"I notice there are already quite a few opinions on this movie as a whole, however, no one mentioned how poor the sound quality was throughout the movie. Maybe it's just me, but I found it so hard to hear what the actors were saying, (especially during the car chase scenes), that I had to turn on the subtitles. The actors' voices were muffled and washed out. Maybe someone messed up in translating this movie to the DVD format."
3,"Cool car chases, but a great deal of unpleasantness","I love car chase movies (my favourites being Die Hard with A Vengeance and Mad Max 2), and this has some of the fastest and best car chases I have ever seen. It's just a shame that the movies heroes weren't people I could get behind. They open fire in crowded streets, resulting in many bystanders getting shot, during one car chase they drive alongside a civilian vehicle as a shield (which results in the driver getting shot and killed), and then even more people get killed in the car pile up's (a truck drives over several vehicles). The heroes are usually supposed to protect civilians and prevent destruction of property, not the other way around."
3,This film wasn't that hot.,"This film was okay but I thought it should have more and better action.And it should have helicoptors.The thing I liked about this film was that it had Sean Bean and Jean Reno,I really like them."

5,This is the best GD movie you will ever see,"If you don't like this movie you are un-American. This has everything, car chases, gunfights, money, extortion, everything the good-ol US of A was founded on. I could go on for hours about how much I love this movie but that would take time away from me watching it again and again. Just buy it already and thank me later."
5,Ronin,"Ronin- Robert DeNiro is awesome, the movie is action packed,good car chase,good cast and locations. a very good and well done movie. Jean and Robert to me are the stars of the movie. I really enjoyed the story."
4,Better every time,"I can no longer count how many times I have seen this movie. Instead of becoming bored, I am still just as engaged as when I first saw it. This is an incredible film.Excitement and intelligence are everywhere. From the beginning, we are following professionals who plan to steal a package, and from the very beginning we know they are the best. They are working together, but they are wary of sharing too much. Among the group are a driver, a munitions expert, a computer expert, a procurement man, and DeNiro. It is never quite stated why he was originally chosen.Robert DeNiro seems to be slow in keeping up with the rest, but then we realize that he is simply meticulous in his work. The more we watch, the more we realize that he is best of the group. DeNiro is fabulous in this role. His intensity here reminds me of his intensity in ""Heat.""I recommend watching this film."
4,"actually,maybe 3 stars,i'm not sure","this is a very fine and well-crafted film made by the genius who made the masterpiece the manchurian candidate,john frankenheimer. the action is very thrilling,and the suspense decent. this film would have been a **** 1/2 star film if not for some silly scenes during the final chase scene and also a silly possibility about the case mentioned by (i forget) de niro or reno."
4,Different but incredible,"This is not a movie for short attention spans- I had to watch it twice before I understood everything. Dialogue and plotting may confuse some- so watch it again! Perhaps the most realistic action/suspense movie I have seen, and a superb cast. It lacks the ostensibly witty scripting and overdone macho characters that are staples of most American films, and substitutes grim realism and an elegant storyline."
5,Best driving scenes ever.,The driving scenes are absolutely brilliant. The director's commentary on the DVD is very informative. It turns out there's a reason the driving looks so good....
4,it still rings true,"I watched this several many years ago, late at night with a group of friends and found the plot a bit vague, the characters poorly defined, the cinematography fair to good, yet still, after all this time, the last number is clear in my head, moving and true. k.d. has a fine voice, uses it well, and has a persona to match. With all that the movie DOESN'T have, it has her and she shines through."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"This has to be one of the worst Lesbian movies ever made!! Stay away, far far away...only for the k.d. Lang fans."
1,One freaked out flick - horrible!!!,"Watching this movie was painful. Storyline impossible to follow, k.d. lang naked, scenes which seemed like hallucinations, slow, and boring. Don't waste your time or money..."
1,Unwatchably bad,"Between the poor acting, and lack of plot I just could not get into this movie. It was uncomfortably off and I took no interest in the chaaracters."
2,"Beautiful scenery, but slow and uninteresting.","Let me start by saying that I love art films. This is a feeble attempt to be one. The cinematography is beautiful, The Song is hauntingly beautiful (though repeated, ad nauseum). By the middle of the interminably long movie, I no longer cared about either of the main characters, and only watched til the end because I hoped something interesting might happen. I don't feel there was any chemistry whatsoever between the characters, and adding a sexual component to it seemed completely contrived and unncessary. There are many more interesting, complex lesbian centered movies: Aimee and Jaguar and Fire, to name just two. Steer clear of this one. (By the way, the momentary glimpse of kd lang nude is completely gratuituous and not the least bit ""steamy."")"
5,Possibly the best film I've watched!!!,K.D. is deffinately at her best with this heart rendering performance. END
2,"Worth a borrow, not worth buying","I loved Percy Adlon's Baghdad Cafe and have watched it several times, always happily: it is eccentric, kindly, and optimistic. Salmonberries is a less happy production, though it deals with a similar theme and an Alaskan equivalent setting. The script and acting are awkward. Oscar Kawagley, in his few minutes on screen, is the only sympathetic character. The persistent German fascination with First Nations culture --- as usual over the top --- called for a pretty unflattering self portrayal by the Innu cast --- who in this movie are called ""Eskimos""."
2,Not Worth The Watch Except To See KD Naked I guess,"I don't consider this a lesbian film at all. There was little chemistry between the two characters. There were many confusing hallucinatory scenes which were simply added. The scenery was beautiful and KD's song (grossly overplayed over and over) is beautiful as well. But honestly, if that's all you can say is this had great scenery, a beautiful theme song and a good acting job by KD...that alone does not make a movie good. Although the acting was well done...the scenes seemed forced and the plot was scattered amongst many scenes trying to be artsy for arts sake."
1,Not worth the money,I bought this dvd based on the reviews listed here. At the time I bought it all of the reviews were positive. What a dissapointment. This could have been a good movie but it was way too artsy and dragged on and on. I did enjoy the interview with kd lang that was included in the dvd. I also thought she did a good job with the material she was given but I would not recommend anyone buy this dvd.
3,"mildly interesting, but not what I thought it would be","This movie was ok, as I said mildly interesting, but less ""explicit"" more sensual than sexual (with only a brief ""nude"" scene by ms. lang). It was an interesting study of two people, tormented by secrets, and each seeking their respective pasts.Permeated by the ""haunting"" as it has been described song by ms. lang ""Barefoot"", it was a study in the lives of two sad, lonely, people. I was surprised to find Chuck Conners in this movie, but his role was minimal. Renting it would be ok, or if buying..."
1,Horrible,"Don't bother. This movie is just plain bad and not even worth watching for the scenery (Alaska or K.D. Lang). It is not even a lesbian movie. There is no romance at all. As someone who lives in Alaska, I can tell you this movie is not realistic nor would these people survive here. It feels like it was made by someone from Florida. Also, a plot would be nice."
1,Simply Awful,"This is one of those movies that is so self-important that if you don't like it, you are made to feel as if you are intellectually incapable of ""getting it."" I say that this is a case where the Emperor is naked. This movie is contrived and uninteresting. And heaven forbid that you watch the bonus features... Honestly! You'd think that this movie was up to getting a Nobel Prize."
5,Excellent Textbook,"If you want to learn Hungarian, even through self study, this is the book for you.Its similar in approach to the text books in senior school for French,German, Spanish etc - starts off with easy general items and phrases and builds through a series of execrises and texts to give a good capacity to understand written Hungarian. It would be best to watch a some Hungarian TV on the internet too, to get the practice for understanding spoken Hungarian."
5,"Don't understand Grace, you don't understand the Bible","Grace Pluse Nothing opened my eyes to what the Law is and what Grace is. We say with our mouth's we believe in Grace but with out actions we demonstrate LAW. This book will help. I have ever taught out of it. It works! Bob Coker, Canton, Illinois"
5,Wonderful!,"I wish this book was still in print. It is, next to The Complete Green Letters, by Miles J. Standford; my favorite dealing with the grace of God in Jesus Christ. Harkin not only does a wonderful job explaining basic biblical truths in everyday language, he does it in bite sized pieces! This book is a must!"
5,grace plus nothing,I have been a Christian for most of my life. I was never taught what grace was. I rededicated my life recently and was reading about grace and never understood what grace was. This book has given me so much insight.
4,Nice holster at a good price,Well constructed and well made. Nice fit and is as advertised. Fast delivery. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a holster for their Tomcat.
4,homeward bound 2,"this is one of the best films I have seen yet.As you already know is is the second movie of the homeward bound series starring all the same charactors sassy, chance and shaddow in this movie the family are going on a trip over seas.

5,the escape,when pets accidentally get separated from their vacationing owners chance shadow and sassy navigate the mean streets of san francisco trying to find their home across the golden gate bridge. but the road is blocked by series of hazards both man and beast. it's another incredible journey for the three very brave very lovable pets. in a thrilling funny adventure that's bound to please the entire family. made by new york post.
4,almost as good as the original,"My kids have watched this one a lot, but they seem to ask for the first more often. If you are only buying one today, go with the first movie."
1,broken,When I received this Product the package part that hold the DVD into place was broken. When I tried to contact them about the problem they never responded.
5,Homeward Bound 2: Lost In San Francisco...,This is an awesome movie. your favorite pets are back in this awesome sequel to the blockbuster hit. in this movie we find are beloved trio stuck in san francisco. this is a great sequel one of the best. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
4,Old-school Dominican bachata,"This is the fourth album, from 1994, by Dominican pop star Antony Santos, featuring a more rural, acoustic version of the now-global bachata style. If you prefer the earlier bachata style of the 1960s and '70s (which is hard to find these days -- try the ""Bachata Roja"" compilation album) then you might want to check out these early albums from Santos. It's pretty close to the old sound, and has a nice lyrical melodic core. Recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue World Music Guide)"
2,Kind of a Scam,"I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I was tricked by a deck of trick cards.This package includes two decks. One is a trimmed deck, where one edge of the cards is slimmer and enables the old ""pick a card, any card"" and a few other routines which rely on being able to pick a card out of a deck by feel. The second deck is a completely standard deck of Bicycle playing cards, and the instructions that are included tell you to mark that second deck yourself, whether with ink or by making indentations in the surface of the cards with a pin.The trimmed deck is great. You can get up and running in just a few minutes feeling out the cards and astonishing your friends and family. But since the second deck is identical to any deck of cards you could buy for as little as $1.25 here on Amazon, you're paying a premium price for a two products combined that could be bought more cheaply separately."
4,Brilliant delivery of scientific fact,"Marr and Baldwin have come up with a spectacular way to deliver what would otherwise be considered 'Dry Science'. A great intro to biohazards for the general public. This book should be read between meals, and you might want to wear gloves."
2,Try another book,"I am about 1/3 of the way through this book and already see most of the problems referred to in other reviews: poor dialogue, clumsy foreshadowing, stereotypical characters and situations, etc. I WILL finish the book because of the subject matter. If you want intriguing stories and lot of suspense try these: The Hot Zone, The Coming Plague, Deadly Feasts, Secret Agents. And THESE are all nonfiction...."
2,Fction based on true medical science,"Epidemiologists study diseases and their causes and origins, and take the lead in disease investigations. Dr. Marr has a wealth of experience in this area, and he has used much of it to provide a backdrop for this novel. As a result, the science here is reliable, and this alone is refreshing in a work of fiction (compare for example with the movie ""Outbreak""). The Eleventh Plague would provide a worthy basis for a popular movie, and as a novel it moves along at a reasonably good pace from one scene to the next. Don't look for Frederick Forsythe; the style is relatively shallow, and the characters are poorly developed, but it's a good commuter pocketbook, with just enough intrigue to get you to re-open it each day on the subway!"
1,Lurid and badly written,"Two overworked ideas combine in this exploitation effort: the serial killer (yawn) and the out-of-control disease. In the hands of a talented writer, peopled with believable characters, sprinkled with good, intelligent writing, it might have worked. But it doesn't at all. It comes over as a deeply tired idea trotted out by people who should know better. I've read a number of medical/biotech thrillers in recent years and this would have to be among the worst."
3,"Great premise, disappointing delivery","A fascinating story of a madman who recreates the biblical plagues. Frighteningly real scenario, ably delivered but falling short of truly spectacular. The scientific explanations for the biblical plagues themselves are one of the most intruiging parts of the story. Where the book falls short is in the characters and the writing itself. I found it difficult to empathize with the hero and found the characters generally two-dimensional. Discounting that, the premise was excellent, and the scientific background disturbingly plausible. I think the authors show promise and can improve with a little more practice."
2,This book is interesting from a medical standpoint only.,"""The Eleventh Plague"" is interesting only in its details of the dangers of bioterrorism. It has a poor writing style and the dialogue is extremely stilted. None of the characters is well-developed or even remotely human. The villain is a lunatic out of central casting. Naturally, his crazy mother made him the madman that he became. What an original plot line! The author knows his medicine, but if he wants to attempt fiction once again, he should learn how to write believable dialogue and how to create well-developed characters."
1,Interesting premise ruined by horrible writing,"As an infectious disease specialist and Pro-MED subscriber, I was most eager to read The Eleventh Plague. Despite a plausible and interesting premise--a recreation of the biblical plagues using biological toxins and infectious organisms--the book utterly failed to please. The writing is stilted and leaden; the characters, flat and uninteresting; and plot development, non-existent. Don't waste your time on this book; read The Coming Plague if you want an accessible and well-written text about infectious disease disasters, past and present."
2,I suppose I may have read worse,"The concept of a bioterrorist using the biblical plagues was a good starting point, and the opening chapter was riviting. From there on, however, I was more and more disappointed. The writing was disjointed, the character motivation ranged from inadequate to silly. This book will certainly never win the Nobel Prize for literature. Still, I have to admit I did finish it. But really, would anyone with any knowledge of modern forensics not immediately reveal information to the FBI?"
2,If only these authors knew how to write,"This book is essentially the combination of the movies ""Outbreak"" and ""Seven"" except you never sense the hysteria in ""Outbreak"" and never identify with villain as you do with Kevin Spacey in ""Seven"". These authors have the writing ability of 5th graders. The charcacters are completely underdeveloped. At times it seems if the writers have a thesaurus at their side judging by the use of overly complex and trite vocabulary. The authors also have a serious problem in the overuse of the excamation point. Unlike Sphere, which was a far better book than movie, The Eleventh Plague would make a far better movie than book."
1,Ugh.,"Why do authors have to put so much politics into fiction? Within 20 pages we have 3 shots at Christians, and a shot at Reagan. In addition, inexcusable editing is seen right away. A sub-chapter has a date and time listed that is obviously incorrect - I have no idea how an editor missed this.Read the Cobra Event instead."
2,Mulligan Stew Plague Story,"I truly wanted to enjoy this book, especially after reading the Cobra Event. Sorry to say that while the book was a quick read, it was also a terrible read. Recipies for bioterrorism notwithstanding, the characters were extremely one-dimensional, the killing off of major characters was a ploy to get you to read another few pages.In my humble opinion, if you want the tar scared out of you...Read Preston's ""The Cobra Event""."
4,"Somewhat interesting, but predictable","A good page-turner and another spin on a popular topic of fiction as of late. Not badly done, though. I enjoyed the tie-in with the bibilical plagues. However, the stroy was was somewhat predictable at times."
1,How can so poorly written and edited book get a high average rating?,"Crowd sourcing is great, but here it seems to have missed the boat.This book has to win a prize for poor editing, meandering prose, and typos throughout ... and it almost has four stars?This is one of those ideas that seem interesting while shooting the bull at a bar, and then you sober up. The authors, to their promoting credit, have taken that idea, and marketed it in any way they can.Read a non-fiction book about this topic - any non-fiction book - and you'll be better off."
5,A fabulous story.,"Stand back John Grisham. This is a fabulous story, and it would make a great movie. --James D. Johnston, Charlottesville, VA"
3,Worth reading despite its shortcomings,"When the first two pages had the dates of a Sunday event and the preceding weekdays mismatched, I had forebodings of plodding through another poorly edited book, but it was interesting for the various scenarios. Now John Case has a book so similar in plot that I have to wonder what went on. The John Case book has fewer gee-whiz facts, but is more compelling reading. If you've time, read both!"
5,This is one great book!,"This book is really hard to put down. I had many bleary eyed days at work because I kept telling myself, ""Just one more chapter"", while reading this book at bedtime each night.I appreciate it that the author didn't try to ""dumb down"" the writing. Using enough true medical terms and facts that I learned a few new things and a new word here and there (i.e Gran Mal seizure)."
2,Starts with a BANG Ends with a FIZZLE,The first half of the book keeps you wanting to know what happens next. The last half keeps you wanting to know when you will be out of your misery. One of the most boring chase scenes and endings I have ever come across. What a disappointing ending to a fine start. Kind of like a Stephen King book where he goes on too long and ultimately loses the reader with a nonsense ending.
4,"Good thoughts, weak solution",Great to read through. Some good brain food. But the solutions he espouses are reminiscent of some 1970's feel good scenario.
2,"Some good points, but one sided, and predictable...","I read this a number of years ago and took it to heart. P>Like Korten, I have problems with corporate rule, which is a real threat. But I tend to have more respect for a person who lives simply than I do for someone who's taken full advantage of the system which s/he then knocks down mercilessly. Further, there IS a corporate trickle down much more than from ""activists.""Ask those who're working for corporations and are making more than they thought possible a few years ago.Unless alternatives are offered, I have no use for this kind of rhetoric any more..."
1,The book is an inane anti-capitalist diatribe,"The book is a piece of inane tripe. I will not dignify it with any further analysis or comments. What does in my opinion warrant comment is that Amazon allows a reviewer to refer to an earlier reviewer as ""a complete and utter idiot"", especially when he totally fails to understand that the allegedly idiotic comments are actually sarcasm by someone whose position agrees with his own. What happened to enforcing the review guidelines?"
4,An Excellent Analysis of the World Economic Situation.,"While I found Mr. Korten's proposed solution a bit utopian, his analysis of the global economic situation is right on the mark. Anyone who believes ""globalization"" is good for humanity should read this book."
4,Good listening !,"Beautiful songs where the words, the singing and the playing come together in a very harmonius, pleasing sound. Good listening!!"
3,Something intangible,"I intentionally waited a long time to start reading this series. There was something about the hype that bothered me. But, now that I have started reading the series I am hooked. It is a fun easy read and the subject matter is fascinating in its own right. But, that said this novel was almost entirely predictable and teh character developement is weak. I agree with many of the criticisms against this book. Yet, there is something intangible about it that made it very enjoyable despite its weaknesses."
4,Slow but insightful,"Trib Force was extemely slow, there wasn't a lot of action and adventure, however the ground was laid for the rest of the series. I think neccessary questions were answered. It gave human insight into romance, fear and making deals with the devil. Without giving the story away, I say it is a must read if you plan on using this series to minister to other people. You need to understand the since of genuine turmoil and how it affects relationships. Remeber these people still have 7 years on earth to look forward too, they are going to be lonely, afraid, and hungry for knowledge. I feel the book did an excellent job of story telling."
2,"Good Idea, Weak Story","This book is teen level reading at its best. The author spends to much time telling about the first book. The comments about the Catholic Church and Catholics are not theologically or historically accurate. If you want to know what the Church teaches and has always taught, go directly to the source, not some teaching one protestant minister has handed down to another. The concept of the story is a great one. It just doesn't deliver. It moves way to slowly."
4,Forceful sequel,"As the Second Left behind book, it follows in the greatness of the first, but continues to grow the characters, making them more interesting and subsequently helping the reader connect even more with the very real and poignant characters. With Action, romance, friendship and lots of immanent danger, this book is a pager turner. you have to see what develops between Buck and Chloe, or how Rayford will cope with his challenging circumstances, and what is happening in regards to Nicolae's agenda. A must read book in the left behind series."
4,After the Rapture - Now what?,"The second book in the best-selling Left Behind series showcases Rayford Steele, Cameron ""Buck"" Williams, other family members, and the evil Nicolae Carpathia. Rayford, his daughter Chloe, and Buck explore their new found faith in God, and together forge a collation that will be called the Tribulation Force. Entering the drama is a Dr. Chaim Rosennzweig, an Israeli scientist, with an uncanny knowledge of Scriptures. Together the Trib Force attempt to survive the mining work of the world's new dictator Carpathia. The authors' latent work on the theme climaxes to what the Christian book of Revelation refers to as the Red Horse of Death.This was a book I reviewed for Tyndale House Publishers."
5,"Excellent, exciting page turner on the final days of earth","I can't wait to get my hands on the other books in this series. The fictional projection of Appocolyptic times, all based on serious Biblical Doctrine makes for a frightening thrill ride. It also provokes some very serious, deep thought and, if you will, soul searching from within. I would recommend this book to any and all."
5,Great Series,"Not many books can captivate people like this series, I have read books one and two, and am awaiting the arival of book three. I could not put thest books down. The hint of realism, or should I say the possibilty of realism make you step back and check your life and evaluate you future. I have already recommended this series to several people and they are awaiting their turn to read it. Double thumbs up!"
5,Makes you look at your relationship with GOD.,"Left Behind is a wonderful book very thoughtprovoking and make you take a closer look at yourown relationship with God. I gave the book to mysister in Christ to read when I finished and wentout and bought the Tribulation Force and NicolaeEven though the stories and not real the scriptures are true , Jesue is real, God is real,Hope Mr.LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins continue to writeBooks like these three. I have read them all andbesides from the Bible its good to read thoughtprovoking books that you can back up with the wordof God (with the scriptures) continue to write more..................wgaskins@bellsouth.net"
5,Tribulation Force,Great Series. A friend recommended this series and I was not disappointed. Really keeps your attention. The type of series that you will miss when you have read all of them
5,"Left Behind Series, Book 2 - Tribulation Force","Absolutely wonderful book that provides an easy to understand chronology of the events in Revelation. Thanks to the writers for scribing this book, and series, to enable non-scholars an aid to better understanding God's word. This series lit a fire in me to read and discover more about the end times."
4,"Long, But Intriguing","After reading the first novel in the Left Behind series, Left Behind, I was compelled to read the second novel because of becoming closer to God through the book. Though the plot was thick, I was bound to the book the entire time I was reading because of unexpected twists and turns and the death of an important member of the Tribulation Force at the end. It was excellently written and kept me wanting to read until the end. After the pregnancy of Hattie Durham, I knew that the rest of the books would be interesting to read especially with the upcoming wedding of the Anti-Christ and Hattie. I cannot wait to read the third book!"
3,I would skip this book in the series.,"The Left Behind series is the best I have ever read, but quite frankly, this was the least exciting of all of them so far. It is more focused on relationships, and moves rather slowly. You get all the info you need at the beginning of the next book. It's really not worth the time. But definitely keep going in the series. They are excellent."
1,Extremely disappointing; doesn't deserve one star!,"I read the first two books in this series simply because a friend asked me to. If I didn't have such high regard for him I would never have completed the first one, LEFT BEHIND. I am amazed that anyone could praise this as good writing! If the Bible had been this poorly-written, and the people and events it tells about had been recorded in this shallow and unbelievable a manner, the scriptures would never have survived the first century. I also find it disturbing that so many readers seem to be forgetting that this is FICTION, not some addendum to... or divine explanation for... biblical prophecy. The blatant use of wide margins and large print in the books to make them appear more substantial appears, to me, greedy and cynical. Count me as one Christian who finds this series offensive and insulting to the reader's intelligence!"
1,"Maybe It's Just Me, But . . .","I really tried to click with this series, but it never happened. I know the titles all sell well, but I'm still wondering why. While the plot of this one is interesting, it is obvious to me that the author, or authors, have no conception of how to create believable human characters or write dialogue that sounds anything like human beings actually talk. I guess the appeal of this series is ""What happens in the end?"" plus the set-up so people will rush out to buy the next installment. I know lots of wonderful people who are evangelical Christians, and they read these books with delight, but personally I think the books are kind of an embarrassment to religion. I hope there are some Christian authors who can do better than this."
1,Slow book with no plot,"""Tribulation Force"" picks up where ""Left Behind"" ended, and like that book, this one's slow. After the first one, I thought maybe things would start to happen in this one, but they don't. There are a few plot elements that are connected with endless filler. And all of the things that do happen in are completely devoid of suspense. There's one major event that we're told after the fact via a TV newscast. You might think that a book about the end of days would be interesting, but these authors obviously don't know how to write a thriller. It's just endless soap opera. This book and ""Left Behind"" should have been one volume. If all the books are the same pace, the whole series should have been a trilogy, but of course, then they would make less money.Don't waste your time on it and don't encourage these talentless hacks by buying their books."
3,Here's your character development,"In this book, the authors almost ""over-develope"" the main characters for you. You will appreciate this later as you journey through the books that follow. You get to know the very thought processes of the Tribulation Force members as they confront relationships, career changes, and dirty tricks. The strongest element of this book for me was the explanation of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the 144,000 Jewish converts, and the Two Witnesses. You might find yourself making copious marginal notes in your Bible (as I did) from this book to further enhance your understanding of this part of Revelations."
3,Misguided and oversentimental fluff.,"I have a bone to pick with how this book seems to overemphasize the romantic relationship and underemphasize the relationship with God. For example, when the antichrist is tempting Buck with a job offer, does Buck pray? No. Does he seek help and strength from the Holy Spirit? No. What does he do? He thinks about Chloe. In fact, here's what the story says:""Chloe was the object of his attention, and he realized that God had planted these thoughts to help him resist the hypnotic, persuasive power of Nicolae Carpathia.""Say what? Excuse me, but the last time I checked, the Bible didn't say that the best way to fight temptation is to think about my girlfriend. And some of the thoughts I do have about my girlfriend sure don't seem to come from God! It would have been much more biblical if Buck had relied upon God during his time of temptation, not thoughts about some girl. This book has some pretty weak theology and an over-sentimentalized, sappy plotline."
4,"Not as good as the first, but still worth reading!","I consider myself a fan of the left behind series, but #2 is just not my favorite. The reader is left to wonder about large chunks of time that disappear, I believe it was 18 months. When we are talking about a time period of only 7 years, 18 months is a substancial amount of time! However, overall the Left Behind series is excellent. I encourage my non-Christian friends and Christian friends alike to borrow these books, and if nothing else it definately forces one to think about where they would stand if the Rapture were to occur tomorrow. Many people argue the superiority of the Christ Clone Trilogy over this series, but for what they are, the amount of recognition the Left Behind books have received is amazing. I am definately looking forward to the continuation of this series!"
1,I Hope People Realize this is FICTION,"I hope people will realize that this series of books is pure fiction and are not led to believe that Christ will come first and ""Rapture"" them away. And for those who are already hooked I say, do some real study and you will know the truth. Don't be misled by the false stories of men or women."
5,It is one of the six best books you could read!,This book inspired me to have a much closer and stronger relationship with God so that I wouldn't miss my chance.
3,Dragin it out a bit.,"I thought that Tribulation Force was good but that the pace had slowed down. It was a little bit kind of stretching things out I started to think maybe these guys are writing a book about the end but they're sure building up some cash. A friend of mine did not agree he liked it even better then the first two, so you figure it out. I'll bet you want to know what happens next?"
5,Hard hitting.......,"Very insightful, a bit draggy with the romance, but that is part of life.....A definite impact on my life and my thinking."
3,"Still corny, but better than Book 1","This series will definitely NOT win any literary fiction awards. The reason I read this book is because ""Left Behind"" got really exciting the last couple of chapters and I just HAD to find out what happened to Hattie Durham, the woman everyone loves to hate, and Buck Williams, gotta love the guy! I liked this better because there was more character development and like a typical sentimental fool, have become endeared to the main characters. If you read it as fiction rather than theology, you will probably enjoy this book, which I consider light, fanciful reading. However, on the plus side, it DOES make the events described in the eschatological book of Revelation more digestible for the layperson, especially if one does not desire to work very hard to study the Biblical text."
2,Just bad,"I'll set aside the theological debates. As a book, this is not good. The writing is sophomoric at best. Especially when the authors are describing budding romances, the dialogue, pacing, everything suffers. About the only parts that were interesting at all were a) the appearance of the two witnesses, although, as someone commented, it feels weird when one of them just places a phone call later, & b) the exposition of the Scriptures on the Messiah by a noted Jewish rabbi.What's with the passage of 18 months?About the only good thing that can be said, from my perspective, is that somehow, the authors cause you to keep flipping pages. You just want to see what's going to happen. Sadly, in this book, the answer is not much ... and those things that do happen are described in plodding prose and strained dialogue.1.5 stars. I'll round up."
4,Lovely!,"This book gave me a wonderful feeling of hope. Despite the horror in which it is set, this hope shines through in the lives of Rayford, Chloe, Buck and Bruce.Apart from the Antichrist storyline, I loved the developing relationship between Buck and Chloe. I couldn't stop smiling over ""the flowers are in the trash"" misunderstanding!I enjoyed this one more than ""Left Behind"", and will definitely be reading the third in the series."
4,Spellbound!,"This book was given to me by a friend at work to read. While she knows i love to read, she doesn't always bring me the best material. This time she was dead on! At first I didn't think this kind of book would be up my alley but I found hard to put down once I picked it up. I read it in three days, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough while reading it and when I was done with it I popped right on to Amazon to pick up the next in the series! I'm sure you will too! The only flaw I could find was that the leading characters seemed to lack something I haven't quite put my finger on yet. The romance between Buck and Chloe seems a little obivious and the story would not suffer if the authors had chosen to eliminate it all together."
1,missing pages,about 25% of the writen book is missing on all the left behind ebooks Ive purchased from you? I will not purchased any more
1,"I thought this book was a very weak, predictable story line.",You'd be better off spending your time reading the Bible. What a poor literary work.
2,Lacks depth or insight,"It's become pretty standard to attack these novels, but having read them with an open mind, it's hard not to feel that there's a lot of truth behind those attacks. There's nothing wrong per-se with the books, the problem is more that there just isn't very much right about them. Essentially, it all seems to boil down to a glorafied ""We told you so!"" And honestly, I'm looking for more from a religiously themed book. When there's writers like C.S. Lewis and 'The Weight of Glory' or Brian Caldwell and 'We All Fall Down', both of whoem bring insight and depth to their ponderings of Christianity, it makes it pretty hard to recomend wasting your time with these novels."
1,Totally Ridiculous Trash,"I wish these authors would wake up and smell the roses! They really have no idea what is going on in today's world regarding the end-time scenario... How about a little research guys instead of a bunch of bullcrap! It's really sad to think that the Christian community is this shallow... but, then again, just turn on TBN!"
5,The best glimpse in to the future that I won't be here for.,"Before Left Behind came out I read another book called the Third Millenium by Paul Meyer. The Meyer book seemed to have been written more to prove the writers' theory on when Christ would return and why (statistically) instead of giving the reader a story that they were drawn directly into like Left Behind. I read Left Behind in 3 days. I felt so much a part of the book that I felt I might miss something if I put it down for too long. This book made me think more of what people will actually go through after the Rapture and how much I don't want to be a part of those Left Behind. The sequel, Tribulation Force, probably rates an 8 or 9, because it seemed to be trying to cover a larger time period in the limited space of this book and one more sequel. In all, I can't wait to read the sequel to the sequel"
2,Good post rapture stuff/sappy romance,"The authors are MUCH better at bringing a sense of reality to the post-rapture world than in their development of a connection between lovers. The ""aw-shucks"" romance between Chloe and Buck is very poorly written. Agonizing over holding hands and Chloe's coyness over whether she had been kissed by Buck - PLEASE, next time more bible-related action and less dumb romance! On with the plagues!"
2,eat of the fruit,"I still don't understand why everybody makes such a big deal over Jesus's ""left behind."" The right behind is just as luscious and one must part them both to eat of the fruit."
2,Disappoiting Follow-through,"I agree that this second book really doesn't seem to go anywhere. It spends an extrordinary amount of time on stupid misunderstandings between two characters. Almost like a bad episode of a situation comedy. Also, they don't really examine the faith of these new characters. The new faith the characters have is too perfect. These people are still human, but do not seem capable of making mistakes. And the non-believers do not seem capable of doing much right. All in all, neither is it illuminating about Christianity and the end-times, but it is also quite boring as a supernatural thriller. Hopefully, Book 3 will rev up the action and the character development."
3,tribulation force,The next book in the left behind series is one that inroduces new characters and they find out that nicolae is the antichrist so they try to keep their faith so they can fight it.
1,YAWN-boring and predictable,"This book was slow, poorly written and predictable. It was more an introduction to the series that a book in itself. At almost 500 pages, this 'introduction' was too long. I kept reading, in hopes that something interesting might happen. No such luck. This book seems to have been written at a 8th grade reading level. Pick up a Peretti instead."
2,Lame romance plot dressed up as an end-times thriller.,"This isn't an end-times thriller. It's a romance novel, and not a very good one, set against the backdrop of the end times. The characters are plastic and the relationship is inauthentic. Yeah, right, two lifelong non-Christians would have such an innocent and chaste relationship. If this was written realistically, everybody would be hopping into bed immediately because of the impending doom. And don't get me started on the contrived nature of the rest of the plot. Any episode of The X-Files has better writing than this.Don't get me wrong; I'm a Christian and I don't mean to slam Christian writers. I just think Christians should expect more from their novels than stuff that is only marginally better than Harlequin."
5,A BOOK WORTH THe READING,the whole series is worth reading . I have the books now i am putting on my kindle and reading again
5,A great story of Revelation,I am so thrilled with the entire Left Behind Series. This book was the best I have read of the series. Or that of any book. I finished this book in two weeks (for me that is a great time) because the author kept me guessing and anticipating what was going to happen next. This is a must read for people who are interested in the rapture. May God Bless you all.
4,Fast paced.,"Tribulation Force kept me turning the pages, but the resolution of many of the subplots was a little awkward. I'd just read the recently published global war novel The Triumph and the Glory, which has an ending which will warm your heart, so perhaps Jenkins second book had a tough act to follow in my mind. But I'm looking forward to reading the next one."
3,There are better Rapture novels,"I did not find this story as credible as I think it should have been. Probably the best Rapture novel on the market right now--in my opinion the best ever written--is ""The Last Day,"" which I read several months ago. It has the realism and wrath of God intensity that makes for an incredibly suspenseful, exciting and unforgettable story. The ending is inspired and totally unexpected. If you liked ""Tribulation"" and ""Left Behind,"" you'll greatly enjoy ""The Last Day."""
2,Lots of Fluff,"They could have put this book together with the first one, fit it in a smaller paperback size and only charged $7 instead of $13!!!! The story really slows down in this volume as the authors concentrate on the personal lives of the heroes. It was an easy book to read, but didn't have the grabbing power of it's predecessor. I enjoy the biblical end-time scenerio, and will probably read at least the next volume."
5,Fast paced ride though St. John's Revelation,I couldn't put this book down. As a matter of fact I went to an all night book store to pick up the sequel as soon as I finished the last page. The characters were well developed and immediately believable. A must read!
5,This chilling story will keep you on the edge of your seat!,"In their end-times novel, Left Behind...Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins told the story of those who were left behind as millions of people all of the world disappeared when Christ came for believers. In Tribulation Force, the authors pick up the story of Rayford, Chloe, Bruce and Buck who have formed the Tribulation Force...This chilling story will keep you on the edge of your seat"
1,A Variety of Problems,"The reasons I disliked this book were:1. The book was poorly written (the characters were flat and one dimensional, the plot was taken directly from Revelation with no obvious creativity on the part of the author2. It was anti-Israel and anti-Semitic (Having Israel welcome the Anti-Christ enthusiasticly, and resume animal sacrifices (How believable is that) and having all the Jews either be quick to be ""saved"" and become Christian or gullible fools who flocked the the Anti-Christ3. It was anti-foreigner (having the anti-Christ be Romanian)4. All the characters were flat and stereotypical.Jenkins and LaHaye had the opurtunity to write an interesting and informative series about the end of the world, to inform both Christians and non-Christians about the prophesized Tribulation. They blew this oppurtunity, and choose to fill it with their own beliefs instead."
1,lots of fill...little thrill,"As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat. There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book. I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point. Overall, very disappointing."
2,A Force to be Unreckoned...,"After reading Left Behind, I couldn't wait to read Tribulation Force. I was hoping things would get better. They didn't. If anything, the general quality of the series hit a new low. Originality and Depth are two features that seem to have been left out of this model. I understand the rave reviews from Christians who have nothing better to read; but maybe we can consider these a wake-up call to get some decent Christian fiction on the market. When the non-Christian world writes compelling fiction, and the church settles for English 201-level ""novels,"" it's time to work on bringing at least a smidgin of class into the Church. Tribulation Force was, in a word, depressing. The only reason I give it two stars is for the fact that it is communicating to Americans, and therefore is not a complete failure."
1,How did this get 3 and a half stars?,"The only reason I can think of is because most of the readers are christians. This book is full of illogical occurances, thinly veiled racism, sexism, anti-science, anti-semitism, anti-atheism (the list goes on but you get the picture).It's the kind of thing I'd expect from someone wno was raised in an environment that degrades peoples intelligence, reason, and free thought. After generations of this pile up the real interesting deformities appear and this book series really shows those deformities."
2,A reminder that prejudice is still rampant today.,"Let me begin by saying that I read this book because it was selected by the members of my book group. I was displeased with the first in the series and am likely to dislike the rest of the series. However, I did not dislike the book because of a lack of writing skills or creativity. I disliked it because of its strong use of prejudice and anti-Semitism.The book basically attacks the Jewish people saying that they are denied entrance into heaven because of a small portion of their beliefs. I grew up being told of an all loving God. This god would care much more about the way a person lives their life rather than their denomination. For me the book served as a reminder that some people still disrespect others simply because of a name or title."
3,Getting annoyed,"I loved this series when it came out so when I saw the free copy of Left Behind on Kindle I snatched it up. This one wasn't too horrible price-wise so I figure what the heck - imagine my dismay when I saw that the next book in the series in $9.99! Considering there are like 13 books in this series, thats over 100 bucks to duplicate on Kindle a series I already own. For a couple of Christians who claim they want to win souls for the kingdom, these guys are awfully interested in making money.The book itself is 5 stars - the authors get zero."
1,Blahh!,"After reading the first book Left Behind, I was so geared up for the second book of the 12 book series. Man, I was so disappointed. I actually found myself hoping one of the main characters would be eliminated to stop the madness of boring ""does he like me?"" ""does she like me?"" This theme was throughout the whole book. The end of the book was good and it let you know that it wasn't all for nothing because the next book which is Nicolae has to be better."
1,"like the premise, but how slow can it be...","Well, I am reading the series, because I like the premise, but why is it written so poorly? So many negatives that make me leaf through the pages, reading ""diagonally"" - to avoid all the flashbacks, uninsightful insights of the characters, cheesy dialog - just to get to actual events and action. Chloe really got on my nerves. The writers mention several times how smart and sophisticated she is, but never actually ""proving"" it - neither through character description, nor through her actions/dialog. What I really disliked about this book is how every minimalistic movement any character made had to be described - who called whom, who went to pick up/drop off whom, everyone's goings and comings and incessant (sp?) worrying about each other and leaving messages and checking messages... arhhhhhhh... u get the point - too little actual content. With such a grand premise, why subject reader to pages and pages of boring and mandane."
5,A teenagers point of view,"I just started to read the Left Behind series because my dad has the whole collection as of now. I really enjoyed Left Behind, the first book, because I was really interested in the Rapture and just the whole book of Revelation. I loved Tribulation Force! I thought it was a good mix between telling the stories of the bible and a bit of real life in between. Being 18 years old, I thought having a bit of the ""love interests"" were a good idea. It kept me wondering and gave it a little spunk that a lot of teenagers need to keep reading. Besides that, I could never put this book down, I just had to keep reading and reading. I read it in about two days which is pretty short for a lot of kids my age! :) But because I read this one and it ended it drama, I HAD to keep reading! And as of now, I'm still reading and hope to finish this absolutely exciting series!! (thanks dad!) :)"
1,Unbelievable,"So here's the logical problem at the heart of this book and the others:IF all of these events are prophesied, IF they are all bound to happen ....why do anything? Why bother with a ""Tribulation Force?"" What are they doing? What's their purpose? There's no free will at work in the world that's described here, anyway, so why bother to take action?And if you are going to take action, if you know that this guy is the anti-Christ, why not just kill him? Half the main characters in this book have ample opportunities to off the guy, even if it involves risk to their own lives (a small price to pay for killing the Anti Christ, you'd think). So why don't they at this point...oh. Because it's not in the prophecies? Well then..Do you see how illogical this is? Do you see the difference between quality fiction, which gives us a world like the one we live in - filled with free creatures making decisions, facing unknowns - and propoganda disguised as fiction?"
2,Fiction-lite,"If you're in need of Sunday-school remedial lessons you may find something of value in these incredibly light-weight novelettes. Stretched out to garner as many sales as is feasably possible, each of these commercial exploitations is a very superficial and unsophisticated read. In contrast, read Glen Kleier's complex and spiritually satisfying supsense thriller THE LAST DAY and you will see how much gold can be mined from this rich topic of the End of Time. For my money, there has to be more to a novel than simply a validation of fundamentalist Bible interpretations. I'm also looking for a story, characterization, and theological insight. These books are very disappointing in that regard.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
1,There is no intelligent life on this planet!,"Wow! I'm terrified! Either end up in heaven with billions of brain-dead sheep or burn in hell for all time... I think I'll get used to the heat...I would like to refute the childish arguments made in this book with some reasonable analysis but I understand that reason has nothing to do this... thing. Scary that 50 million books were sold. This is scary stuff... what does that say about the 5 million people who bought ten books each? ;-)As a Christian, I was brought up to accept Jesus into my heart... however, I don't like the company I find myself in. What's with these fundamentalists anyway? Can't they understand a metaphor?"
2,Not all that thrilling,"If you expect scares and chills, this book disapponts. The writing is not very challenging, nor is the plot particularly surprising or complex. A much better book in this genre is a novel called THE LAST DAY by Kleier, which is a far more chilling and fascinating look into the dark corners of the last day. Once you've read it, I assure you, you will look at these other attempts as light weight. There are many books on this topic, but very, very few deliver the huge potential of this huge topic."
2,Who is the editor of these books?,"I read these books in an average time of 4 hours. Each book I readkeeps my attention for a less amount of time. I find myself skipping over passages that are just repeats of a passage 4 pages back. Obviously these two gentlemen are not writers. I feel sorry that their editor did not catch onto this and do some cleaning when they received the manuscripts. The plot lines are ridiculous and do not flow with time. A good writer would not have to title a chapter ""18 months later"" that is a title for a television sitcom. Also if bombs were going off in the major cities of the US I really doubt a Range Rover salesman would be sitting behind his desk waiting for a customer. I think maybe I am analyzing a book that doesn't deserve analysis, it's just fluff. Fluff books are what you would see on the NY Times best seller list. These books require the intelligence of a 12th grader to comprehend...."
2,Great story but character's dialogue is unbelievable,"To be fair, I have to say I can't put these books down because I want to know what's going to happen next. However, I really don't like the writing. It's written at about a sixth grade level and is so repetitive that I skipped pages and pages of repetitive content. I sincerely hope the authors will raise the bar on their writing because I, like many others, am eagerly awaiting the last book in the series."
2,Too much Soap.,"This books left a lot to be desired. There really was too much emphasis in the first part on Buck and Chloe's relationship with missteps galore. The entire time, I was thinking, just get on with it. I was about ready to set the book down when it finally moved beyond that and got interesting again. The middle was better, but you know they were in trouble when they had to skip 18 months to get a cliff hanger so you'll be hooked for the next book."
4,"A great read, except for one thing....","After reading Left Behind, I was eager to read more. I started on this book immeadiately after I finished Left Behind. Anyway, from the start I have loved all the characters, they are realistic and not totally un-real. I thought this book was great, until they skipped 18 months ahead. I wished we could have gotten to Amanda a little better before Rayford just went ahead and proposed to her! But besides that, it was a GREAT book!"
4,Tribulation Force,"I have read the complete series. I wish I had been more knowledge of Daniel and Revolutions when I read them. However these books gave me an insatiable desire to compare the word with the books. I am doing that now. Except for the fictional parts I have found the books follow the gospel pretty closely.the wicked Pope (false profit) is predicted to be the 112th Pope. Current Pope is 111th. If this is true, time is getting close."
4,Good series,This series is well written and grabs your interest right away. you have to start with the first book to get to know characters. You need to remember this is FICTION not Biblical truth. It can help to visualize what it may be like after the rapture.
1,Tribulation Force (Left Behind #2).,"This book was terrible. I really wanted to like this book, but it was just so bad. The writing was poor, the plot was uninteresting and the characters were thin and unrealistic. Some of the dialogue made me sick - I felt like I was reading a teen romance book. In some parts I thought that I was reading a Track -- good stuff but too bland for an action novel.This book suffers from the same problem as most other Christian fiction: we settle for low quality works just because they include a Christian perspective.Bottom line: unless you like reading books at the third grade level, skip this one. Frank Peretti books are much better."
2,Simple simon interprets the bible!,"Although the story line could have produced a pretty good series of novels, this 2nd book in the series stinks of puerile, infantile writting with an overtly predictable suspense line. The idea is good, the writer could have done better reading a few Hardy boys novels and pumping them up for an adult audience. While not a believer of interpreting the bible literally, the story has good ideas. I will however read the rest of the series, but I will not recommend it to others. Only for those who are not yet at the ""hand holding stage"" of their love life (quote from the book!)"
3,The worst in the series,"This book mainly filled up space. I have to admit the first time I read it I loved it, but it was just the cute romance between Buck and Chloe that kept me going. The rest of it was Bruce preaching an endtimes sermon that was full of bad theology and spoilers about what would happen in the rest of the books, and run-ins with Nicolae Carpathia, who's starting to get more like an annoying, syrupy baddie in a kids movie than a sinister Antichrist. The real action doesn't start til 2/3 through the book, and then it finally has one of those abrupt, annoying cliffhanger endings that characterize the series."
4,It's an eye-opener!,"I bought Tribulation Force yesterday evening and finished reading it today. While I did not believe that it was as good as the first book, it was an eye-opener in regards to how life on Earth might possibly be after the Rapture. It has made me realize that I need to be fully prepared and not let everyday life get me down. I pray that everyone who reads this book who is borderline (trying to live in both worlds) or not saved will wake up so that they are not left behind to deal with what life may be like after the Rapture. I don't think life for the people left behind will be any less difficult than what is depicted in these books. I pray everyday that I will be considered worthy to be taken out of here when He comes back to get his people. As soon as I can afford to get the next book, I intend on doing so. I have become more interested in prophecy since reading these books."
2,Continuing to get even more rambling,I read the first book gave it a 3 star since in the middle it was rambling and long. I bought the second book in the series hoping it would be better. I was wrong. The book has a good plot...if the writers wanted to write a fiction book they should at least try to stay in that path. They are trying to hard to put world events and biblical references together. They haven't read the Bible where it says that nobody knows the day or the time not even the son of God. The tribulation will come but it sure as heck is not going to give us any time to sit back and analyse it. If the authors where writing a fiction book they could have made it more adventurous and not so politically involved. Nice try but I don't think I want to by the 3rd book in the series. This book was way to sanctimonious for me.
3,Good Story line - Poor literary work,"Good Story line - Poor literary workThis book is written at 5th grade vocabulary skill set. I have never been a speed reader but this book is written with such an elementary language that, I was browsing through pages. Most of the dialogue is very simple and redundant. The love story line between Buck and Chloe is very out of touch with reality (sex is taboo even in a dialogue). This is not to say that one would expect cheap love scenes from these authors but considering that this is a Christian book read by millions of readers, it would have been a good idea to approach the subject in a tasteful way for all the readers (why else do we turn to ""other"" sources?) The conversations between Buck and Chloe drove me nuts. For such an intelligent woman, she always manages to present herself less than smart. The book does not show any evidence of her intelligence.I am not Christian but I still enjoyed the book and plan on reading at least #3. I have not given up yet."
2,"Poor writing, but good plot line delivers","The plot of the book could have been condensed into fewer pages. The book was so long that the reading became tedious and repetitive. All together, the plot line was intriguing and kept me interested despite the poor grammar and writing style. I would like to know what happens in the next book. This story would make a great action movie if all of the books were condensed into one story."
4,The Follow-Up,"Book 2 of the Left Behind series finds those left behind with great decisions to make now that they've decided to take an active role in opposing the anti-Christ.Tribulation Force was a typical sequel in long series in that it didn't live up to the success of the first book. However it does build the story to launch what becomes 10 more books in the series.As with Left Behind, this re-release edition contains added content at the end of the book.They touch on the food crisis they believe is coming.Of course, this comes from their own prophecy newsletter.I think at this point, if you aren't a fan of this theology or these books, nothing will convince you. And I think people who believe this End Times theology will claim that it's how it's supposed to be.This book was provided for review, at no cost, by Tyndale Publishing."
5,Books for My Son,"I did not buy this book for myself. I bought it for my son that at this time is incarcerated. He had read the first book of the series and was very interested in continuing to read the rest of the series. When I get books for him they stay at the jail even when he leaves, so I didn't want to spend to much money for a book that he was unable to keep. I love the fact that I can get him used, god condition books and have them sent directly to him. He loved the book and is ready for the next book in the series."
3,It's just ok,"Okay, the first book I read in no time, but this one is taking so long. I really can't say much else except it's slow. And if it wasn't part of the series, I probably would stop reading. Please tell me it gets better again in book 3."
4,Tribulation Force,"If you are looking for a way to study and understand the book of Revelation in the Bible, this is a great way to do it. The authors are very educated in the scriptures but have added a fictitious story alone with the facts in the Bible. You get to live with the characters as they move through the predictions in the Bible of the end times."
4,Decent for a sequel,"While, I agree with most that this was not as good as the first book, it did a good job of segwaying to what I expect to be a great third book and beyond. Answered questions and kept up with characters well."
5,IT WAS TERRIFIC! I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!,"After hearing my aunt & a friend talking about these books in choir practice one night, my aunt loaned me, ""Left Behind,"" and I just couldn't put it down. She loaned it to me on a Sunday night and I had finished by Wednessday evening. It was just so real and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I have already read, ""Tribulation Force"" and I can't wait to get my hands on the next one. I just hope that it will open doors and windows for new Christains. The youth in our church are even reading these books and they love 'em. Thanks for putting these books out!"
4,It is a great series of books!,"I too have read the series of books ""Those Left Behind"" and I find it to be compelling! I wish though that they weren't so confused about the Catholics though! I am Catholic and I believe that I have been saved! Jesus is in my heart and life as he would be for any who follow him and his teachings! I bought the first book on a Monday and had it finished by the next morning! -Denise"
4,"Quick reading, holds the attention",The book continues fairly well from the first book. It ties in events that already have happened or appears that it might. Stories about the End Times is difficult at best. There are so many different versions of what might occure and this story is close to what actually might happen.I just thank God I won't be here to see any of it.
4,Still stirring as the story continues.....,"Great continuation of ""Left Behind"". Found myself skipping through some parts. The characters dialog was a little slow but the action was compelling."
2,The are better books on this subject,"Having read Peretti's THE VISITATION, and now three of the LEFT BEHIND series, I have to say, I'm rather disappointed. If you're reading these novels strictly to underscore your faith, then disregard this review--I'm more concerned with the quality of the story, the plot, the writing--which I found less than enthralling. If you're reading these novels for entertainment, then let me direct you to any number of better Last Day novels, including the best of the lot, which goes by the definitive title, THE LAST DAY. Written by Glen Kleier, LAST DAY is probably the best novel ever written in this genre. Stephen King's THE STAND, while not as spiritual and compelling as LAST DAY, is still an exciting, suspenseful read. Both are far more interesting and thrilling than VISITATION, NICHOLAE, TRIBULATION or APOLLYON. If you liked any of these, try reading STAND or LAST DAY for a more heart-pounding experience."
4,WOW! This is an eye opener. It really makes you think.,I wasn't a big reader until this series came along. I finished Tribulation Force in 2 weeks and the same day I finished this one I started on Soul Harvest. I encourage everyone to read them and pass them on to an unbelieving friend. These books will really make them think about making a decision to follow Christ before it's too late.
1,"Gives Christians a Bad Name, and a Terrible Extrapolation of Prophecy.","It really does give Christians a bad name. I mean, the very beginning, you have the authors explain Buck's thoughts of an affair as a product of his libido! what?!?!?! then Russia attacks Israel because Israel can suddenly make a desert productive?!?!?! (just curious where in John's Book of Revelation they got that from....)I tried reading it, I really did. But I like plots that are actually sensible, characters that have at least TWO dimensions if not three, and written as if the author actually knew how to write a book. I guess some people, apparently millions, don't really care how terribly written a book is.however, I will tip my hat to the authors, they've figured out how to make millions of dollars. Write crappy books geared towards right-wing Christians who hate the UN and you'll make millions....I'll start working on mine now..."
4,Great Book,"This book, perhaps not as good as the others, is a necessary part of the series. If you were to go from Left Behind 1 to Nicolae (Left Behind 3 ) you would be very confused. This book as a lot of character development (like Chloe marrying Buck) that is nessesary to read and understand the rest if the series, and sets the stage for the rest of the books. This book made me want to read the rest of the books."
4,"Excellent effort, decidedly so.","These are the only books I have seen that can sit side by side with Jerry Furland's ""Transfer-the end of the beginning"". I have to say though, while these are entertaining and exciting, so is Furland, but Furland adds the extra dimension of making you really believe it is possible..."
5,This book stands by itself as very fun and captivating,"This book deserves 5 stars when comparing it to the majority of other novels. Although it's not as good as the first, what book can be?This is an excellent book for all audiences, and I would and have recommended it to friends. This is a book that is not only fun to read but will help you in your relationship with Christ."
1,anti-catholic,"I had read Left Behind and about half of Tribulation Force. The series was alright. They had drawn upon a worthy subject even if the execution was rather flawed. The characters were somewhat forgettable but they were easy reads and mildly compelling so I trudged along. Then I came to the part where it says ""most Catholics were left behind"" HELLO!?!?! Can someone PLEASE explain to me what that's all about? This is a blatant and unfair attack on Catholics by two men who are trying to write Christian books? GIVE ME A BREAK! It is a clear prejudice and I am sad to say that I consequently stopped reading the book and encourage anyone interested to turn away simply because of this horrid bigotry."
2,The Modern Airport Terminal,This is a broad brush review of airport terminal planning and operations. It is light on detail and heavy on accolades for select members of the architectural field.
3,not too good,The trick is great but the preparation is a pain if you cant do it and breaks easy if pulled too far and done too many times
3,Danger Zone,"One wonders why the movie was even made. It's filled with action but the plot feels contrived and over-wrought. Worth viewing to see the quirky brilliance of young Robert Downey Jr in a supporting role. Sadly, his character leaves the film too soon."
2,Not Too Good...,"When i first recieved this item, it worked perfectly. Great sound quality, it recharched my iPod, and it was cheap. However, after about three weeks the built-in iPod recharger began to not work. After another week, only three of the speakers worked. After about another two weeks, only two speakers worked. The speakers were good quality to begin with and easy to travel with, however, now only two speakers work and most of the time, there's static. It seemed like it was worth the money at first, but now I'm begining to doubt that."
4,Good portable sound,"We have now purchased 3 of these for various members of the family. Although the sound is not spectacular, it is respectable. The volume is plenty loud for use in the home and even outside around the pool. The best feature is its portability. My wife uses it outside when gardening and the kids have one on their desks for listening without earphones. I'm sure there are products out there with higher fidelity, but for the money we have found this to be a very good buy."
2,At First,AT first it worked fine but after a couple days only two of the four speakers worked unless i bent my ipod forward. its great for trips if it works
5,Magnum Opus V.2,"I paid a little extra for it ($15 US for a beat-up copy), but the music was solid. A great value for what I paid for it. The songs, of course are first rate! Five stars!"
4,Magnum Opus v.2,"Great music, sort of brings me back to the ""old school"" days. I particularly like that these songs are the full ""12-inch"" uncut versions."
4,Good book,I like this book. I've read most of Leigh Greenwood's books and this is a little different from the others. It has good characters and a mystery that keeps you going until the end.
2,Disappointing,"Thisis.the.very.first.book.by.her.that.I.had.a.hard.time.getting.thru,however.I.will.continue.reading.her.because.all.the.pastread.were.very.good.she.is.one.of.my.favorite.authors."
4,An exellent example of the spirit of John Ogdon,"This CD demonstrates the exellent technique of Mr. Ogdon. This CD has all the pieces that make him who he is. The Rachmaninoff is almost flawless, although his playing seemed to be a bit ""heavy"" at times. I have never heard a better recording of ""La Campanella"" in my entire life then the one that is on this CD. -Matthew Weissman"
1,Too much for too little!,"München, 19.07.2001 Yesterday I had the fortune to see one copy in a Rosenthal shop in Munich, so I could avoid the mistake to buy one. Searching a dancer figurine of the 1930' you found only a - bad - picture, no description, no words about the artist who made it, nothing.... The book is too expensive for being just a collection of - many - bad pictures without historical comments."
2,Busted up in more then one way.,"This movie is a story about a small time boxer who decide to fight for charity, even after his girlfriend instisted not to, he did with the promise of never boxing again. It's also about having a love for something and coming to a crossroad with it . Irene Cara, plays a mother and night club singer who has to decide on a singing career or her family. Paul Coufos, plays the boxer and father who also has to decide on a boxing career or his family. The movie really never goes anywhere the direction is slow and the movie itself is low budget which makes it really seem dated. What I do like about the movie are its two lead actors, who do an okay job. I also like the music Cara, wrote and sang for this movie."
3,Interesting First but the second is uninspired!,"Schura Cherkasky is one of my ten Russian pianists ever (Richter, Barere, Affanasiev, Gilels, Horowitz, Sofronitzky, Ochinikov and Sultanov). he recreated the First Piano Concerto with a creative handle of the dynamics, getting so a very attractive register. Ludwig is amazing at the front of the Berlin.Pitifully, the Second was very frustating to listen. Gary Graffman, Michael Ponti, and Gilels are in top form in case you are looking for another alternative option."
4,Franklin's Soccer Adventure,"The 5 stories are Franklin Plays the Game, Franklin and the Tooth Fairy, Franklin and His Night Friend, Franklin's Fossil, and Franklin and the Hero."
5,What a Turtle!,We love Franklin! This DVD is full of his adventures and problem solving. Pleased as punch. All the kids *moan* when Franklin's mother asks him if he wants *flies* with his pancakes!!!
2,All Dexter books are not created alike.,"The story is violent, brutal, pointless, and dull. The same can be said for the characters -- and add ""cliched"". While I enjoyed ""Paris Trout"" immensely, and still see the humanity and motivation behind each of the characters, the same cannot be said for this work. A big letdown."
3,Scary,"Peter Flood lost his family due to his father's involvement in the Irish Mob. He was raised by his uncle Phil who was a major player in the mob. He grew up with his cousin Michael who enjoyed the violent life of a mobster. Peter tried desperately to lead a ""normal"" life and not be involved in ""the family"". He struggled to no avail. It was a sad and very violent story."
3,Definitely Not For Beginners,"I was really looking forward to a nice basic yoga video for beginners. This was not it. Beautiful scenery and relaxing sounds, but the movements/positions and Rodney Yee were too fast for me."
4,"Although short, a great yoga immersion","I had never tried actual yoga before using this video, proving that it is an excellent beginners tape, for I was able to follow the instruction easily. Although it is necesarry to do the yoga along with the video several times before being fully able to keep up and actually feel any relaxing benefits, but after a few viewings it becomes relaxing. This video was a great start and I plan on continuing with more advanced videos from the same series."
3,good for beginners,I bought this tape thinking that it would be a good filler to my regular workout routine. I have been doing a yoga class at my gym only once a week for a couple of months now. I don't think I will watch this video again because I found it too easy and I underestimated my ability. I guess I should n't have purchased a beginner video.
2,good workout but...,"I consider myself an average yoga-er, but this is definately not a tape for beginners. you have to know what the poses are beforehand, as he moves from pose to pose very quickly, not really explaining how to get into some of the poses, which someone with no experience (aka beginner) would get lost. I would recommend this tape to more advanced yoga fans, as you will know most of these poses and be able to keep up. My only gripe is with his billing of this as for beginners, otherwise great workout."
5,"Challenging, but not too difficult","This is a short efficient workout -- good for intermediates. You have to know a little bit about yoga and be able to do the postures correctly because the instructor moves quickly. If you are looking for a longer workout, this is not the tape for you. However, it is perfect when I am in a crunch for time and I really enjoy it."
2,Slow Down,"He goes to fast. He shows the 5 basic moves and then he takes off into the routine. It was hard for me to follow him, especially as a beginner. I allowed a family member to watch the tape. They said the same thing. I'd like to exchange this video for another beginners version."
5,"Not too hard, not too easy","As a 28 year old mother of two who is about 20 pounds overweight, I find this workout just hard enough to feel challenging, but not so difficult that I felt discouraged at the beginning. I don't get out of breath, but I sweat some and at the end I feel in my muscles that I have done some real work. I had never done yoga before, and I'm not particularly athletic, and I didn't find the poses too difficult to manage at the beginning (except the one where you're seated with both your legs and your torso elevated with your arms extended in front of you, but I can do it now). After about two weeks of doing the workout not quite every day the more strenuous poses are a lot easier, and I can feel a difference in my muscle tone. And I've lost six pounds (though I've also been dieting, so I can't give the video all the credit for that). Also, another reviewer mentioned the speedo in a very negative way - it's a little distracting at first, but I certainly wouldn't call it offensive."
5,Certainly gives you motivation,"After doing plenty of research about yoga - such as breathing technique, posture, and purpose of many positions - I was left on my own and lacked motivation to practice everyday. What good is knowledge of yoga without the motivation to practice it? Rodney Yee certainly provides that motivation! The calmness he exudes, and how easy he makes each position look, makes you want to incorporate yoga into your physical and mental life just so you can have the power of body and mind he seems to have. I've always found that the worst motivator in any exercise routine is the idea ""I have to do this so I can get skinny"". Rodney Yee makes you realize its not about your weight, its about having power, and strength, and well-being. Great for anyone who wants to feel every muscle in their body work, as well as people who just want some stress relief!"
4,Great video!,I wanted to try yoga as an addition to my normal workout routine and this video is a great compliment to any excercize program. It is relatively easy to follow once you begin and works all muscle groups! Plus - the last few minutes of relaxation exercises are bliss at the end of the work day! I highly recommend.
1,Definately NOT for beginners,"I bought this series thinking ""beginner"", that's definately for me seeing I had never tried yoga before. However, after watching 10 minutes of it I started wondering if there was something before ""beginner"" as there was certainly NO way I could keep up with this! The moves were too fast, there was no instruction and by the time you registered exactly what the name of the pose was, he was already on to the next one! I'd skip this if you're just starting, this is definately more on the ""been there done for a few years"" route rather than just starting out."
2,Not for beginners,You should at least be familiar with sun salutes before beginning this tape. The instructor doesn't take time to explain the poses and he goes through them pretty fast.A fine intermediate workout.
5,Excellent for physically fit beginners,"I love this video, it's worth every penny. I look forward to every session and feel better after this yoga workout than I usually feel after 45 minutes of abrobics. Great for a cool down after heart rate has been up for a long period of time. I am a beginner and found this very easy to follow. I will memorize this entire routine and will pass the tape along to friends and family!"
4,Another Pick for Puns and Play,"Heather McHugh writes more delightful and profound poems in Shades. Her main concerns seem to be time and language, drawing from relationships. She often pulls in unexpected parallels, and she also tightens things together by playing with similar sounds.One example: In ""Inflation"" (page 25) she compares language to money and moving pictures. (""Language wasn't any / funny money I was playing with, / no toy surprise"" and ""But now I'm dumb / to frame the stream / of stills I feel"" and, touching them together, ""a bill of silver senselessness--the seconds counted / in the hundreds, in the thousands, in the billions, till the till"")It gave me great pleasure to read this book and I recommend it."
1,horrible,It wouldn't read some cards that were put into it. Took forever to load up the drive with the card in it. And even deleted info off of one drive by itself. Don't buy--spend a little more and get a better one.
5,Flawless,"Seven Samurai is among the greatest and most influencial movies of all time. Its plot has been much imitated, including the western remake as ""The Magnificent Seven."" It masterfully deals with plot elements like friendship, caste distinctions, heroism, and a disappearing way of life. If you've not seen it, you must.If you have seen it, the Criterion Blu Ray edition is the one to have. The visuals are remastered, looking as pristine as any movie lover could desire (some artifacts and dirt remain, but such are unavoidable). The sound is great, and the presentation, extras, and packaging are worthy of display.Get this one, you won't regret it."
5,A master piece,"Don't need to say much if you know this movie. It is what it is, has it all, great story, great characters, great messages."
4,Culturally intreging,"Sub-titles, a little slow and not outstanding cinema - but well worth the time. A fun way to ""have been there."""
5,For a B&R Fan... A Must Have,"If you like Big and Rich and want more, the Super Galactic Fan Pak is the perfect piece. The DVD features tons of their great songs off the Horse of a Different Color CD. The bonus features are cool... like the interview which is like 40 minutes long and hilarious. Plus the CD is cool too. The Bob Song and the version of Drinkin' Bout You are both really good and hysterical. A very good combo of the DVD and CD... and well worth the money."
2,1 of my best purchases this year!,"I liked Big & Rich before, but this DVD made me fall in love with them. It's hilarious & it's such an insight into their personalities, how they interact with each other, & how the Muzik Mafia came to be. I whole heartedly recommend it to anyone who even slightly likes B&R, because it only gets better the more times you watch & listen to them!"
2,Hsing I,"I enjoyed some of the writing vignettes, other than that, ya stretch, ya breathe, ya throw some punches. Nice.If your only gonna buy one martial arts type book, buy another one."
5,Smart Buy,"One of the funniest, wackiest shows of all time. One of the smartest, too, although not usually given credit for that. Perfect casting, inspired writing, and wonderfully brought to life by Don Adams, Barbara Feldon, and Edward Platt. The price is very fair, I dislike DVD's that are triple the price that they should be. Great entertainment, great price, a laugh a minute and more. Bring on seasons 3,4, and 5.DVD MENU PROBLEM: Just for accuracy I should add that the menu on disc #4 is slightly faulty, there's no way to go directly to the final episode because when you select it the DVD takes you to the next to last episode. You have to get to the last episode via the ""PLAY ALL"" method. Amazon replaced the entire DVD set, but the replacement set has the exact same problem. Still a great DVD set, so I gave it 5 stars."
5,A great farce comedy,"Get Smart was a very good farce comedy that spoofed the spy movies and it could be exceptionally funny. The 1st and 2nd seasonswere excellent. After that it got a bit worn as they began to run thin of material. But in the 2nd season they were still runningstrong with lots of laughs and lots of good gags.The humor was cornball and predictable, but with the great delivery by the actors, somehow that just made it all that much morefunny. Good comedy is hard to do. And these wonderful clowns knew just how to pull it off. They had a good combination of banter,jokes, gags, and slapstick. And they could deliver it with good timing that seems all but a lost art in modern comedies."
5,"Smart, Smarter and Funnier","I Love this Season of Get Smart as much as the first season. Buck Henry and Mel Brooks have combined to create very light-hearted, satirical look at the life of a spy. Very entertaining and fun for the whole family if you want. It is very fun to see so many actors and actresses making guest appearances early in their careers. Get it, you will love it too."
4,"horrible and grotesque, but interesting in film history","Now here is a slice of poverty and corruption, in the hands of a filmmaker who would go on to create a series of classics of the grotesque. Accattone is utterly worthless, unattractive, and doomed, a destroyer who continually finds willing victims. You cannot enjoy watching this, but you've got to admit it was original at the time."
4,a sad and beautiful film,"Accatone is Pasolini's first movie and it's real magic.Pasolini shows a deep respect for his characters.Marcel Carné,the great french director said after the projection it was a wonderful movie."
3,"Educational and Boring, It's Life!","I saw this movie for a class a while back and found it to be very slow, but informative because it reflected a part of life in Italy. Though I must admit I've been to southern Italy and Accatone can still be seen in present young Italians. Poverty,lazzines,pimping sounds horrific but in this movie it sometimes becomes comical. This should be a must see movie if your looking to compare or analyse changes in Italian society."
3,"Great Film, Nearly Invisible Subtitles","Buy the other edition. How many times do they need to use white subtitles in black-and-white films?!Sometimes it is virtually impossible to read the subtitles during te film with this edition.Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie, but black-and-white films should have yellow subtitles.Or at least put black bars behind the subtitles so they can be read!"
1,Great film- shamlessly bad print,"International Film Forum presents a print of this film that couldn't have been much worse if they had pulled an abused 16mm print from the garbage. Visuals: Blacks are washed out, midtones are coarse, visual noise and scars abound. Sound: there is distortion on all significant sounds- this had been used so much that the sound is uniformly damaged. This is simply one of the most worn-out set of reels I've ever seen, in cinema or on video. Even the picture on the box looks dreeadful and has a moire pattern. Bottom line: Avoid- this version is no competition for the entirely servicable earlier release by other parties (though I forget who did it- not Film Forum)."
3,"Great Film, Nearly Invisible Subtitles","Buy the other edition. How many times do they need to use white subtitles in black-and-white films?!Sometimes it is virtually impossible to read the subtitles during the film with this edition.Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie, but black-and-white films should have yellow subtitles.Or at least put black bars behind the subtitles so they can be read!"
3,"Works well but flimsily made - great coffee, uses less grounds.","Finding a good small coffee pot is tough. Cusinart built well but can't see contents and not great. After research found elite, cheap, good coffee, but construction poor and flimsy. Would buy again."
4,4 cup coffee,good for the price but would like the coffee to be hotter. If this is important to you then it's 3 stars instead of 4
1,"Great design, does not work","The Elite Cuisine coffemaker is a sleek, modern design, but it does not function. As read in other reviews (should have heeded the advice), the water is not heated sufficiently to effectively brew coffee. Tried it several times, same result: warm brown water, with almost no coffee taste. Returned."
1,Bad Purchase,"When I read someone's review BEFORE I ordered this item, it said the glass pot easily spilled it's contents. To be honest I thought maybe the purchaser was all thumbs..........well, not so. I ordered this coffee pot and the glass pot design is really a poor design overall. It does spill even if you're super careful so there's a lot of waste. I was fortunate to find a coffee pot that fit the bill perfectly from Mr. Coffee AND FOR THE SAME PRICE I got a more features. Bottom line......don't waste your money on this one."
2,Arrived DOA,"Seems like this product has features we'd like, however, upon arrival it does not work. Power light barely flickers. It will not operate whatsoever.Fortunately Amazon has a very good refund policy, so the coffeemaker is on its way back as a returned item. Unfortunately, we still need a four-cup coffeemaker and will not have it as the birthday present it was intended to be."
2,Filter is the problem,"The coffee maker works fine but the filter cavity is not standard so you cannot use standard #2 filters without modifying them. Although it has a permanent filter that comes with it, it is fragile. The purpose of the purchase was to find a coffee maker that used standard cone filters."
2,carafe broke,I've had this unit for a backup office coffee maker so even with infrequent use the carafe cracked. The plastic is flimsy and I cannot recommend this item. I gave it two stars because it is inexpensive so I will just replace it with Mr. Coffee maker.
3,First unit broke after one use,"The first unit that was delivered boiled water once which you need to do before you make coffee the first time. It never worked again. I contacted the supplier 'MaxTool' and was told that I was responsible for the return postage. I love paying extra for getting a defective product. I will never purchase anything thing that is provided by MaxTool in the future.The second unit works fine, nothing spectacular and makes a good cup of coffee."
4,"Makes good coffee, filter holder moves around","The Elite Cuisine 4-Cup Pause-'n-Serve Coffeemaker makes very good coffee - comparable to our Cuisinart coffee maker, which is quite good.The filter holder doesn't seem to stay put after you put coffee in it and swing it closed; the top of the coffee pot seems to snag on it - need to hold the filter holder shut while removing the pot.Otherwise a nice product; quite small, but big enough to make two cups (all coffee makers have too small a cup serving).I'd buy it again."
2,Not a great coffee maker...,I was disappointed with this coffeemaker. The coffee is luke warm and the 4 cups is more like 2. I would not recommend buying this coffee maker.
5,Great,I used to be a professional cook and I think these pots and pans are great. I love the glass tops.I use soap and water and if I need to scrub them I use Bon Ami and they are like new.
2,Wouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.,"My cousin and I both got a smaller set of these as a graduation present from my parents. I love to cook, and I was excited to get a nice set of pans. DISAPPOINTED! They do stick. Very badly. I have to use ALOT of oil to get food not to stick in the frying pan, and I'm pretty sure that's NOT healthy. There is a huge outline of a chunk of Tuna on one pan that stuck after I didn't use enough oil. And I don't care if my pans get scuffed up, but it's just kind of funny. You can tell it was a piece of fish. I also don't think that they heat too evenly. And the handles do get VERY hot. However, I bought these handle covers at Crate and Barrel for a couple dollars that are made out of that heat resistant silicon or something. They slide on and off. They are wonderful on the sauce pans and the frying pans! The saucepans and the pots perform okay. I think for the money, I'd spend a little more and get a different set."
4,Great for the money,"I cook a lot and this set is great for the money. It cleans up great, just like any other stainless steel cookware. Using barkeepers friend works great. Cooks just like any of the expensive stainless cookware. I agree that the handles can get warm and the closer to the pan and burner the hotter it gets, but since it can go in the oven up to 400 degrees, it makes sense. Also the variety of pans is great for all uses. It has an 8 quart stock pot compared to many 5 qt. And the sauce pans are 1,2 and 4 qt which is exactly what I needed. I have to say I love the set, the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the warm handles, but other than that I would definitely recommend this cookware, you can't beat it for the price."
3,Too Hot to Handle,"These are decent quality for the money when compared to what else is out there but after using them for almost a year, I wish I had sent them back and spent a little more for a cookware set with handles that don't get so hot.This is such a disappointment. The variety in pot, pan size is great but the handles are way too hot. I'm surprised that Wolfgang Puck would put up with cookware with such a design flaw."
2,Poor Quality,"Everything sticks, the pots and pans stain and the handles get really hot. I had other cookware that the handles never got hot. These will burn you! I used them 10 times and put them away and went back to the cast iron, I know those handles get hot also but the food doesn't stick to cast iron the way it sticks to these pans and the cast iron are easier to clean..."
1,Not worth it!!!,"I know Wolfgang Puck famous and all, and you would think he would make good cookware set...NOT!!!! Once you use any of the pots, it will never be the same..no matter how many times you clean it, the pots have a look like they 100 years old. And I hate the pan for frying..I couldn't take it anymore so I went and got Kitchen Aid (which I LOVE)...so I don't know what's the fuss is all about...I would return it any day..but it's too late :("
5,Unbelievably HIP!,"Helen Humes is the greatest of all the 40's-50's r&b female singers(only Ruth Brown comes close). Humes is backed here by various small groups including the famous jazz critic Leonard Feather's band. This entire cd has a jump blues/swing feel, but it is all 100% great late 40's pure r&b, it it's best, and Humes vocals are liek a dream come true, like honey. She's so hip you'll flip!"
1,Unfulfilled Promises,"I ordered;Men's Ostrich Print Horseshoe Chukkas; TAN, Size 9. They did not have the item in, Tan, but instead, shipped me a shoe in, Brown. I loved the shoe but I did not like the (Brown) color they substituted. I subsequently returned the shoe for credit. GIVE ME WHAT I ASK FOR, NOT WHAT YOU THINK I SHOULD HAVE. Mr. Augustus Sam."
4,Very Enjoyable Read,"Joelle Fraser writes a very honest, sweet memoir that is a pleasant change from the usual brag memoir. She takes us on a journey through growing up and understanding ourselves and the ones we love. She allows us to see the painful as well as the pleasurable moments in that growth and I find this very refreshing. Also, being a lover of Hawai'i, I enjoyed the brief journey to that state as well!"
2,Save yourself some time,Flower-child child comes of age. Your older sister's diary is a more interesting read.
3,Definitely worth a read,"There are several points in the narrative when Ms. Fraser slows down, focuses on one particularly scene, and leaves the reader with a lasting impression. In one such case, she describes sitting wrapped in a blanket, drinking hot tea, and reading in a chilly Oregon apartment. I felt as if I were in the room myself, holding that steaming cup, bracing myself against the cold.Since this is a first book, there are some weak points, too. Some of the transitions are strained, and some points needed clarification; however, on the whole, this is a fine first book, and there are enough shining moments to keep you reading. Nice job, Ms. Fraser."
5,Wonderful Book,Every once in a while you pick up a book and know in first few pages that you are in for a great ride. This book takes you on a journey through the life of Joelle Frazer from the beginning to the present. The honesty and complete willingness to share all of the events of her life is truly moving. What courage. I can't wait for the next book!
5,I look for a gem,"I read alot of these kind of books, trying to findout what it is that makes relationships tick, that little gem of advice. Bruce Springsteen said in an interview that ""we're pretty much moulded by the time we're about eight, and spend the rest of our life trying to figure it out."" After reading the book, I learned more what drives people into relationships that don't make sense. This book answers alot of questions for me."
4,Old School Horror,"This really is old school horror. In case you are unaware, this short story was written in the latter 1800s and the writing style reflects the standard of the time. Stevenson (who brought us ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"") doles out a cautionary tale about supply and demand, and the meeting of old friends. A quick but satisfyingly grisly read."
4,This used to have a much cooler cover...,"a detailed drawing of a huge heart of stone, Cher sitting next to it(with big hair)and from a distance...it all looked like a skull! Some used-CD's stores may have one festering in their bargain bins(I found it on cassette). The music doesn't reflect that original cover(may be why they changed it): it's power pop, heavy on lovelorn ballads. Very entertaining, but not exactly varied, colorful or substantial. Probably the best Cher from this period however, as ""Cher""(with ""I Found Someone"")and ""Love Hurts"" were slim on the hits. B+"
4,80's Cher,"HEART OF STONE is a strong effort from Cher. Her voice lends very well to these songs, and it's a fairly consistent effort start to finish. The album opens with the mega hit ""If I Could Turn Back Time"", a signature song for Cher. There's a mix of a little of everything on here, from rock, to tender ballads. The feel of the album is very 80's, definately because it's from that era, but it's still a solid sounding album. I enjoy the tender ""After All"" with Peter Cetera, the theme from CHANCES ARE. Other hits spawned from this album included ""Heart of Stone"" and ""Just Like Jesse James"". My favorite tracks include ""If I Could Turn Back Time"", ""Starting Over"", ""After All"", ""Still In Love With You"", ""Does Anybody Really Fall In Love Anymore?"" and ""Love On A Rooftop"". As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a good CD to start your Cher collection with. Not a bad CD to add to your collection."
3,Interesting,"She has a few good songs and one inparticular I like on this one called, You Wouldn't Know Love. I love Cher as she's such a visual performer and her voice has just gotten better. Newer CD's show even more improvement."
2,Cher,"It is hard to know what to say about this CD.I used to think it was kinda cool but now I don't.The problem is that I dont like Cher.But if you do like Cher,well,Cher belts out rock hits with a gutso.I bought it because I loved the JesseJames song."
5,"Excellent, thought provoking book","I heard the author interviewed many years ago, and finally got around to reading the book. The author made many excellent suggestions, and it's a shame that we are so wrapped up in partisan politics that we cannot take advantage of them. Also a shame that the Democrats are beholden to the unions and the Republicans beholden to the corporations and the wealthy, so no one looks after the average voter. Still, I wish every politician in Washington would read this book and take a stand for or against the recommendations...and if they're against, make a better one."
3,An Agnostic Looks at Spiritual Matters,"I purchased this book to learn more about the functions of the right hemisphere of the brain. It was disappointing to have a sermon from a self-proclaimed agnostic advocating that religion be subordinated to ""science"". Robertson acknowledges throughout the book that there are ways of knowing beyond logic (as processed by the left brain). The science part is informative and helpful. It's his added editorializing that weakens the book. He concludes it with a push for a ""new religion"" to emerge, some odd mixture of various existing religious. His argument indicates his religion is science, which contradicts what he argues elsewhere in the book, about different forms of knowing. He lumps all religions together, seeing them as essentially being all alike, with Buddhism being his slight favorite. I learned new information on the way the brain works, however I had to tolerate a lot of intolerance to my Christian faith along the way."
5,"Detailed, Entertaining, Excellente!","A refreshing and detailed book about some of the most intense and gruesome fighting of the war. I must ask when Mr.Rhea is going to turn out more of these outstanding summarys of Grant's overland campaign. It is to be applauded that this book ignores the pro-southern tilt than many works about the Civil War invariably manifest. Clearly this enlightened author is out to provide an account of what happened, not folklore. This book covers it all."
5,Page turning account of this terrible battle,"I loved this book, it is one of the best written and researched accounts on the Battle of the Wilderness. With over 450 pages of text and 20 well presented and easy to read maps this book gives you a day to day and blow by blow account of this terrible battle. This is the definitive account of the Battle of the Wilderness and I highly recommend it to any person who loves a good book on the Civil War."
5,"This Is A Study In Tactics, & Futility","Rhea offers a vivid history of the opening efforts of the Overland Campaign initiated by Grant. This battle was an event that occurred in a hellish tangle of scrub in Virginia. Such a landscape would complicate the efforts to not only win a battle, but to survive. This book tells how the complications worked to create one of terrifying battles. Leaders could not meet the demands on them, and others would simply cease to be effective in this battle. The soldiers would struggle to execute their responsibilities. The Wilderness was a huge disaster in human terms as people were killed by bullets and burnt to death while they lie wounded. It made little strategic sense, as the fog of war clouded all who were involved. It would mark the start of a new era of fighting in the Civil War, an era that would require more heroics just to survive. Rhea captures this all in a very readable, but still very vigorous work. I would recommend this to anyone!!!!"
4,works well,"the lamps came quickly, were priced well, and we at least as bright as the OEM version for the projector. I can't make any statement about the lifetime, etc.- but it was packaged in a three pack, which was nice."
4,long wait for a solid album,It took the waterboys a long time to create something new but it was well worth the wait. The excitement when this album was released was intense at my home. I tried to explain it to my wife before the album came out-she'd only listened to the vinyl records a few times. They caught her imagination and now she too is hooked.
1,"Dream harder, indeed!","My only exposure to Mike Scott and the Waterboys was in the form of the two Celtic influenced romps, ""Fisherman's Blues"" and ""Room to Roam."" So, when I tried to listen to the over-produced, cliché ridden, New Age pomp, feel-good, self-indulgent schlock that passes for music here, I was stunned.""Dream Harder"" ranks up there as one of the all-time most annoying albums I've ever heard. No tired, overwrought, or slick contrivance was spared in recording this utterly unlistenable mess. And that doesn't even touch on lyrics here. You would be hard-pressed to pen stuff with more of a cringe factor than these words:Corn circlesMysterious symbols in the fieldsCorn circlesMysterious symbols in the fieldsNo one knows - are they phonyOr maybe are they real?Or these:Winter winter on the waybitter cold she bringWinter winter on the wayhard and deadly thing . . .Dream harder, indeed!"
1,Mediocre at best,"I bought Dream Harder after being quite impressed by Fisherman's Blues. Alas, this album had predictable lyrics (you can make a game out of guessing what the next line will be because the phrasing is so obvious), pretty but insipid and repetitive eurofolk music, and a total lack of soul."
5,Loved It...,"A great cast and story. It's so witty as only the English can make. It's not a current movie, so don't expect any of the current stars with the exception of Maggie Smith, who is one of England's greatest actors. I didn't know how post WWII England was like when it had to ration meat, especially pork, during it's lean times. The story comes to a funny and entertaining climax at the end. Without giving the story away, I felt sorry for the pig. Although, I just couldn't stop laughing. I highly recommend this movie to adults with a great sense of humor. Let your children watch the cartoon channel. They just wouldn't appreciate the adult humor. I'm a ""Carry On"" fan so expect the same humor. The quality of the blu-ray is very good, if you into blu-ray movies."
5,Them's got cream cakes!,"A vivid and comic look at dour Britain in the early 50's, just as Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen) is about to get married. Local celebrations are hampered by food rationing - and a stolen pig becomes the centre of attention. Lizzie Smith as the old mum is brilliant, Richard Griffiths excellent (he is in ""Withnail and I"" too) and Dame Maggie Smith as Michael Palin's wife is just right.Denholm Eliot, as a local bigwig, is a revelation. Buy it! Pity it's not on DVD."
5,A fantastic slice of life..by Alan Bennet,If you love British movies you'll love this Maggie Smith and Michael Palin (Monty PYthon) in a very funny slice of British life
3,A Private Function DVD,"The humor is low-keyed, but the hardships of the postwar ration come through loud and clear. Well, more hardships for some than for others, but that's the way it always go. The ordinary person usually gets the short end of the stick.PS Not a good DVD for vegans and vegetarians."
4,"For certain tastes only, but good Brit fun","It's all about the Princess and the Pig in this bleak black comedy, which takes place in war-rationed England, circa 1947. The princess, only in a peripheral story, is Elizabeth; and the pig, who takes front and center, is Betty, a sow who's being illegally fatted for slaughter. She gets a second chance at life when someone (Michael Palin) steals her. Very dark comedy, not for the light-hearted!Staci Layne Wilson"
2,I don't understand why people find this funny,I thought this film was boring. The mother in law is the only highlight amongst all the other uninteresting and undeveloped characters.
2,Snore,"The description given of the film on Amazon was enticing enough to buy it on sale. Despite a well of talent from which to draw in Michael Palin and Maggie Smith, as a comedy, it will generate a snicker or two, but the real laughs are utterly absent. If this film were an aircraft, it would never get off the ground."
4,Charming wartime comedy,"The Alan Bennett-scripted A Private Function is an amusing tale about a chiropodist's attempt to steal a pig in post-WWII Yorkshire. Michael Palin is the longsuffering husband whose wife, Maggie Smith, wants to eat pork and move up in the world during a time when rationing was still in force, and the market for illicit meat was booming.Eventually Palin and rival pig-thief Richard Griffiths, looking surprisingly porcine himself, fall in love with the hapless swine.This is an often very funny look at postwar Britain from a unique perspective. It boasts a stellar cast that also includes Denholm Elliot, Tom Postlethwaite, Bill Paterson, Alison Steadman and Liz Smith."
4,Not bad,"I also thought the story ended rather abruptly, almost noir-like. The ending, while cute, wasn't as satisfying as I was beginning to anticipate, thus a 4 star rating. Otherwise, the film does build interest as it goes, smouldering in the beginning but aquiring clarity and sense of direction as it continues - only to break off suddenly as you find your interest engaged. Either way, it is still a good, if short film at 92 minutes, with a subtle sense of humour and a recognizable cast who put in fine understated performances."
2,weak,"This last Phil Rudd appearance in AC/DC (until ""Ballbreaker"") marked the beginning of the three weakest AC/DC albuns, along with FLy on the Walland ""Blow Up Your VIdeo"". It has bad production, a sense of Deja-Vu, Brian Johnson singing his worse. For Christ's sake, just listen to ""For THose About.."" and ""Back in Black"" to see the difference!!!"
2,not the best,"This C.D is not what i'd call the best album AC/DC's made. There's Flick of the Switch, which is a decent sounding song, but after that it's really boring. I see many people puting this cd before Fly on the Wall, but I have to say that this is alot worse. Don't buy it unless u can get it cheap."
3,"OK, but not one of the best","Nothing very original here. About half of the songs on FLICK OF THE SWITCH are not bad, the rest are average. If you like ""Back In Black"" and For ""Those About To Rock"", you will like some of this."
2,Same Old Song and Dance,"While at this point, AC/DC had not hit their all time low in the ""Dark Ages of Rock"" ( the mid-80's ),it was drawing near and this shows it. With the release of ""For Those About to Rock"", the songs were still good, but sounded a little too similar. This album has only gotten worse,and more repetitive.AC/DC was clearly running out of ideas fast.While AC/DC did sve themselves in the early 90's with ""The Razors Edge"" this is just a little too low quality for AC/DC and way too repetitive, all the songs just seem to flow together..."
4,Our boys reach their peak,"For Brian Johnson and the boys, this was probably their peak artistically. Regardless of how much bigger the tours got, they really hit their peak with Flick of the Switch. I've always thought of Back in Black, For those about to rock...., and Flick of the Switch as a trilogy as the formulas are almost identical, which is what really makes them enjoyable to listen to. After this, I think the closest record is their most recent, Stiff Upper Lip. Bon would be proud, and promply have another drink."
4,This one is on fire!,"There seems to be an obsession with 'Back in Black' on the part of those listeners who are stuck in a time warp;'Flick of the Switch' is the post-Bon Scott album that comes closest to the glorious 70's era in terms of grooves,bitchy licks and attitude:if you ever tire of the black album, go for the white one instead,but handle with care:it's white hot!"
4,Superb,"A great, under-rated album. I would put the tune ""Flick of the Switch"" up against ANY other metal song in the rock universe and dare you to find one that rocks harder. This CD is worth is just for Flick of the Switch, Badlands, Nervous Shakedown and Bedlum in Belgium. Buy it. Listen to it loud."
3,RISING RAW POWER,"This album came right after 1981's For Those About To Rock.They did a really good job in trying to recapture the raw sound of the early Bon Scott albums (LET THERE BE ROCK,HIGH VOLTAGE).The truth is that most of these songs sound the same.This is the stage when they were beginning to sound repetitive a bit(or at least that's how they sounds in my ears) but the guitar playing is excellent as always.The standouts on the record are NERVOUS SHAKEDOWN,BEDLAM IN BELGIUM and GUNS FOR HIRE..An AC/DC DIE HARD FAN who would consider this a 5 star album.It's nowhere near BACK IN BLACK and HIGHWAY TO HELL.It's a really good raw rock record.If you wanna buy something from AC/DC start with BACK IN BLACK or HIGHWAY TO HELL.Not one of their best or one mentioned in conversations on their discography but certainly one of the enjoyable ones on their canon.ROCK IT!"
3,"Really good, really rocks","This CD is very good. It opens with the thundering ""Rising Power"", a true AC/DC crafted tune. It has ""Guns for Hire"" and ""Bedlam in Belgium"", and, believe me, the lyrics are not so ridiculous as others albuns by them !!! Unfortunately, Phil Rudd left the boat soon after the recording. After this very good release, a true AC/DC album, nothing was the same.. After ""Flick"", came their worst effort ever, ""Fly on The Wall""."
3,Weak by AC/DC standards,"I almost gave this 2, but a few good songs here makes up for the rest of the CD. Guns for Hire is a good headbanging tune. Badlands is good, and This House is on fire isn't bad. The rest though I ususally skip."
3,"More metal in a ""For Those About to Rock"" vein","Here's a collection of songs that sound like they were meant to be on For Those About to Rock, but didn't make the cut for that classic album. All the tracks are tight and stick in your head, but with the exception of a few standouts--most notably, Rising Power--they're all just variations on a theme. It's a solid rock album, better than most and certainly better than anything AC/DC released through the end of the 1980s, but it's lackluster next to its predecessor."
2,Sounds like an album of rejects and half-dones...,"This isn't an awful album, but it sounds completely unfinished. The songs are just there... without making much of an impact. I think THIS is the album that influenced all those bad '80's heavy metal bands. I keep expecting to see the name Warrant rather than AC/DC in the credits. But no, it's AC/DC... It sounds like an album of filler. Not really necessary to own."
5,The Gods are still on Mount Olympus!!!!!!!!,I've listened to this album for years. I believe this to be one of the best albums they ever made. They totally pushed all buttons themselves. This is for a true AC/DC fan.
4,AC/DC Does It Again,"With a straing of kiler albums already under their belt, Flick of the Switch merely adds to their collection of killers. While the production left something to be desired(Mutt Lange's abscence is sorely missed), the songs themselves still rock. My personal favorites are Nervous Shakedown, Guns for Hire, Badlands, and Brain Shake. Still, almost everything is good, with the exception od Landslide, which never really appealed to me. So if you're an AC/DC fan and already have the Bon Scott Albums, Back in Black and For Those About to Rock, pick this one up. It won't disappoint."
4,Grossly Underated effort,"I was discouraged not to buy this album for a long time. Several people told me this was a losy AC/DC effort,but bought it anyway.I whacked in the sterio and from 'Rising power' to ""Brain shake"" I thoughly enjoyed it. I personally prefer this album to ""for those.."". Its got great riffs, has more balls and truly kicks arse.A hiddeen classic by the boys and would recomend this to any AC/DC fan. still not in ""Highway to hell"" or ""back in black"" league, but a great album all the same"
5,"Raw, Hard and Rocking","Like Powerage, this is a great AC/DC album that hasn't gotten all the priase it deserves. It's the last album in which Brian Johnson has the full power of his voice and it shows the band making a definite shift from the bombast of ""For Those About To Rock..."", to a stripped down, straight-up, no nonsense affair. One could say all the songs sound alike (even by AC/DC standards) but that's THE POINT. Look at the simple black & white sketch cover and the running time of the songs/album. It's supposed to just hit you hard and get out of dodge...very punk rock aesthetic actually....although even the best punk never had a nasty groove like these cuts. Imagine if the song ""Back In Black"" just kept hitting you and hitting you, until you stuck up your hands and screamed, ""I give up! You guys are the gods of rock."" That's Flick of the Switch.The last GREAT AC/DC album and easily the second best (right after Back In Black) of the Brian Johnson era. Buy it, crank it up and rock out!"
4,One of the best kept secrets in rock and roll,"AC/DC is a great band, no question about it. When you think of their great albums, you think of Back in Black, Powerage, and High Voltage. Flick of the Switch is not in that league, but...Flick of the Switch is still a great album. The thing about AC/DC is that they are such a good band that most of their albums are good, even their bad ones. My friend and I always thought that Flick of the Switch was one of the best kept secrets in rock and roll, along with Aerosmith's Draw the Line and The Who's Who by Numbers. All had no big hits and sales for these albums were par at best. Just give them all a listen and you'll agree. Some fine, rock tunes. Enjoy them all..."
5,One of AC/DC's most underrated efforts,"I absolutely love this album. I am in the minority it seems as I really like the sound quality. (It was produced by Angus and Malcolm) I would rate it as being my second favorite album with ""Powerage"" in the top spot."
2,Wasn't very impressed,"The writing style was good, but after reading Twilight, the vampire in this story, Christopher, paled in comparison to Edward Cullen. I mean, come on...Christopher can barely lift a box of books because he's so weak from 'transmorgrifying'. Maybe some readers will enjoy this type of vampire story, but I prefer the strong, nonsleeping vampires myself."
3,Warning,"Before you by this book you should be aware that ""Kiss me Forever"", was orginally published by Avid Press, LLC on 10-31-2000. The title of the book was ""Walk in Moonlight"".I feel that I was ripped off because the title was changed and I was unaware that I had read the first story already. I would have bought the 2nd story had it been a stand alone title.Why was there no indication that ""Kiss me Forever"" had orginally been published under another name."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I was between putting two or three stars. After all, I picked three, but I tyhink I should explain why.One star for the first book: and that's given it too much. I didn't like the book, the characters had no deep, and I didn't care what happened to Dixie or to Kit, for that matter. I was relieved when it ended, and disappointed, because I had such good expectations for this one...Two or three stars for the second book: the second book is way better than the first, and I actually ""enjoyed"" reading this one, as it has good moments.But all in all, not my kind of book, sorry."
1,Had high hopes but they were dashed....,I have been looking for a new Vampire series and came across this two in one book and thought I would give it a try. I can honestly say this is not going to be a new series for me. It is soooo boring. I can barely get through it. The action...well what action?? The love story is nonexistent. There is absolutely no chemistry between the Vampires and their lady loves. and really what is the chance that both women end up dying so soon after they meet the Vampires causing them to be turned?? Belch! Horrible horrible books. Do not reccommend at all.
2,Horrible book!,"Inconsistent story line, awkward dialog between characters, luke-warm love story... not much good I can say about this book. I'm so surprised it has such a high rating. I can't understand what people see that they like about this book. I did not enjoy it at all."
5,This is one of the best of what was a wonderfull show.,This episode has everything that makes northern exposure good. If you have never seen northern exposure than this is a great one to start with.
4,Susan Bailey gives us a wonderful Advent journey!,"Susan's first album, ""Teach Me to Love"" is a wonderful gift of original songs sung with conviction and beauty. She's now given us yet another gift--this one a journey through the Advent Season. Her songs are prayerful, hopeful and offer us an opportunity to turn inward and meditate. In these frenetic times, filled with too many obligations and commitments, this album should be in every car, and in every home...simply put it on and allow the melodies, rhythms and messages pervade us and persuade us to focus upon the true meaning of this season--this season of hope--this season of the coming Savior! Thank you Susan!"
1,batman backpack,We were disapointed in the durability of the back pack. My son is in kindergarten and the zipper broke the first day.
3,Read the Borg half of the book... it is illuminating,"Borg is the liberal one, Wright is more of the conservative one. My beliefs are closer to Wright's, but, by God, his writing style is so stilted consisting mostly of jargons (""eschatology"", ""exegetical"" ""Epicureanism"" - and that's just for the letter E) and long, windy paragraphs. In contrast, Borg language is lucid and intelligible."
4,Borg Wins The Debate,"This book presents an interesting debate between two men who have different views of the truth about Jesus. Both men agree that 'the gospels combine historical material with metaphorical significance' but disagree on how much of the material is history remembered. Borg emphasizes that the gospels are heavily influenced by the theology of the developing Christian tradition during the last part of the first century and consequently gives greater weight to the gospel layers he identifies as being written earlier. I am probably more sympathetic to the traditional view of Jesus as put forth by N.T. Wright. However, Borg seems to do a better job of defending his position."
5,eye opening...,other reviews have stated better than i can write...so ill just say that the book is great...and that if you want to learn more than what they teach in church...then this is a great book to read...i plan on reading more books from these authors...
3,"Good intro to great minds, bad debate format","I enjoy the concept of having these two great minds (Wright and Borg) discuss the differences and similiarities in an open format, this does not happen in this book. The two disuss similiar topics, but rarely address the other's specific points. I would recommend buying Borg's ""Meeting Jesus Again For The First Time"" and Wright's ""The Challenge Of Jesus"", to get a glimpse into the core thoughts of the authors. Both books approach Jesus in a way that blend academic and spiritual concerns, only each offers a different conclusion."
2,The Meaning of Jesus,I find this book interesting. It needs to be duscussed in a group as there are lots of thoughts that are opposites and the fact that all of us have different life experiences when it comes to theology.The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions (Plus)
2,Meaning of Jesus,"Meaning of Jesus: I am afraid that there were too many 6-8 syllable words that I had to look up. I also found to hard to slog through all of their opposing viewpoints. Altho the book was thought provoking and created heated discussion in my Sunday class, I did not personally care for it."
4,The Slow Way Back,"Beautifully crafted novel with a pace to savor. No wanton sex or vulgarity, just lyrical prose with a plot that progresses gently and beautifully. I couldn't put it down."
3,A pleasant but lightweight read,"I wanted to like this book much more than I did. Although it was a pleasant beach read, the characters were bland and two dimensional, the dialogue did not ring true, and the relationships were confusing (e.g., Thea seemed to adore her aunt, yet the aunt, as seen through Thea's eyes and based on Thea's observations, was presented unsympathetically. It was probably the author's attempt to show the ambivalence inherent in family relationships, but it didn't work.)The big family secret became obvious early in the book, which led the march towards its revelation to become tiresome, and the revelation itself was anticlimactic.All in all, I would rate this as an uninspired but not unpleasant read."
2,Maybe I Just Do Not Get It,"I found the book to be wish-washy and short on concrete tools for overcoming resistance. The book spends far too much time identifying barriers and pitfalls to dealing with resistance rather than on how to effectively eliminate or overcome it. As a Lean Six Sigma certified Black Belt, perhaps I am jaded against non-data driven decision making. The book acknowledges that a lot of the time rationality and logic often do not play a role in resistance. If this is the case then how can you have an effective repeatable and reliable methodology?"
5,"Revised, updated, infused with value","Rick Maurer has taken the best of his original ""beyond resistance work"", ""Why Don't You Want What I Want"" and added new observations and suggestions to deal with significant change. This isn't blind prescription, Rick uses evidence based research & real practitioner input to revise, update & infuse this book with very useful suggestions to help people leading change to engage those impacted by change. I am totally biased here - I have known Rick for 15 years & have used his ideas with great results."
2,Missing Words in Kindle Edition,I bought the Kindle version of this book for a college course because it was required. Got to Chapter 2 and there are words missing on Location 346 had to get the real book so that I could get all the information. Makes me rethink Kindle versions of books for school.
5,Good read,Just getting started and the author is digging into real issues and has a way to get you thinking of how to take another view.
3,one more of those,"one more of those books we read, enjoy and forget what the heck the message was upon reading the last page.Save your money and buy something else."
5,You can taste the salt and feel the waves,"This story really puts the reader into the thick of maritime lore, feeling the big storm waves in the open ocean and the heat of the Persian Gulf. The author does a great job of writing a mystery that imparts the feelings of the crew at sea and is an interesting look at the international shipping business. As a sailor who has been north of the Arctic Circle in winter, through the Gulf and south of the equator in the summer, I highly recommend this book for a good seagoing tale!"
3,Lean Manufacturing review,"All In all it is a good book. The way it is written though, especially in the first 2 chapters, if you are not familiar with Lean you will be a bit lost. I would recommend reading the glossary first if you are unfamiliar with Lean Terminology. Also the 5S section has the terms in Japanese not: Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain. I Plan on reading it again in case I missed something. But it has some useful information.I would recommend KANBAN Just in time at Toyota as something to be read first."
2,Not what you're expecting...,"If you're looking for an upper-level view of lean programs, this MAY help. If you're looking for anything that assists in the actual implementation of ANY lean techniques, keep looking elsewhere."
5,Awesome book about Bobby and his stories,"I just purchased this book and found it to be a wonderful account of some great stories that took place during this man's life. Bobby Allison gave a lot so NASCAR could be what it is today and the pictures and stories are wonderful.I laughed out loud so many times at the stories told in only the way Bobby can tell one. Reading it was one thing, but the CD that comes with the book is him actually telling some of the stories in the book.If you're a racing fan, this is a must by for you or a friend. Bobby, you done good on this book and you should be proud."
5,Simply awesome stories from a great person and driver,"We got this book as a gift for our son who is really into racing like us. I thought I'd just thumb through it and ended up reading the whole thing. Then, I listened to the CD of Bobby telling some of the stories that are in the book and I went back and re-read those chapters. Needless, to say I have to get another copy for my son now because his gift is worn a little bit - oh well.It's nice to see a book about one of NASCAR's greatest that tells the lighter side of his career. It made me look at Bobby Allison in a whole new light and respect. If you are an old fan of NASCAR you'll love this because of the pictures alone. If you're a new fan, you need to read this so you know where the sport came from and what racing was really like.Just get the book and you'll see why. Bobby, thanks for sharing these with us. It makes me wish you were on the track, still, even more."
2,Not as Described,"Product picture depicted 12 foot 75 Ohm cable with PUSH-ON F Connectors, Screw Connectors on the cable was what was delivered. I could have gotten that from ANY local store. THANKS!!!!"
5,The Destiny of Miro--Great Book!,The Destiny of Miro is well written and thought provoking. Universal truths laid out in an exciting story of a young boy/man's search for his destiny interwoven with a love spanning lifetimes keeps you turning the page to see what happens next. I can't recommend this book enough. It's one that you will keep to read over and over again.
3,Doesn't have all the features it advertises,"I bought this item to display small videos. The manual is not very helpful in telling you what formats or sizes to make the videos. I figured out that Xvid format would display the best, but it was still choppy and had distorted lines and static. Any video with sound would lock the system up.Also Coby technical support has yet to answer any of my emails.I am sure it can play photos, but I am a little disappointed that it doesn't do what it says it does. I guess for the 79$, what could I expect."
3,"Ok item, there are better ones","Item was as advertised; however, any picture that's not bright and vibrant appears too dark. Photos appear darker than originals, and there's a noticeable grainy quality to many photos. If frame is to be used for photos without many details, that have bright backgrounds, (i.e. flowers,) then it will work for you.Remote is very small; too small for older folks to use (i.e., Grandma)All in all, the item is ok, and works as promised."
4,Coby Frame,I just now opened (12/28/07) and loaded photos on a SD card. Depending on the resolution of the photo the picture is pixelated. I would suggest taking all photos at a high resolution. Otherwise it is a great frame.
4,True weight of Product?,"The shipping weight is listed as 3 lbs. However, the product weight is listed as 5 lbs.!A clarification is needed."
4,Nice Frame,The picture frame is very nice. I simply put a memory stick in and it shows all my pictures in a slide show. I would even buy it as a gift for someone. The only thing is that it is made of plastic. I would probably buy something in a different material. But all in all it's a great frame.
5,5000 Open Salts,"I've already owned two copies of this book, myself,(one signed by one of the authors) and purchased this new copy for a fellow collector of open salts. It's the best reference for the money, and most of us would not be without it. There aren't many reference books for the specific collectible, open salts, and this one is the most comprehensive of all of them. Even the two authors of the beautiful ""The Open Salt Compendium"" a more modern and better presented book on open salts, would agree. Nina and Sandy developed their book to take up where ""5000 Open Salts"" left off."
4,Nice Source for TOEFL Preparation!,"Barron's has always been a trustable study books.I study TOEFL with this book in class.If you study by yourself, you'll defenitely need to buy Audio CDs together.They're really good.Model tests really help.Always try to keep the time and one after one another model test,you'll see some improvement.TOEFL test is not so difficult after you study for it.Good Luck!!"
2,Software does not record answers!,"When taking the practice tests, you cannot save your speaking test answers. So, you're just talking into the air... Also, you can save the writing section only in the practice mode. In the test mode, your essay simply disappears....The Longman has a much better CD-ROM."
2,Not really i'm expected,"In this package is only the audio CD's.May be this product is useful as part of teacher's material, not for self-study."
1,Incomplete!!,I opened my package to start studying for the toefl test... and I figured it out that It was missing the CD AUDIO NUMBER 3... I was so pissed because I spend $23 and it is incomplete... The person that sell it should let us know all the details of the product and of course and it should be cheaper.
2,Ordered new book- received old book,"I ordered a new book. However, the book has marks with ink and pencil on most of the pages. looks like they have sent an old book."
1,POOR,"This CD set is useless without the Barron Book, and when you buy the book the CD set comes with it. So this CD set alone is a useless purchase."
3,you need to bay another 10 cd,the book is good but you need to bay another 10 cd to use the bookso if the book come complete with its 10 cd it will be better
2,Good Book but the CD sucks!,"The book is good, it has very good content and exercises but the cd is really bad. It is really slow, and get stucks in some section. It is so bad, that sometimes the question simply does not appear! I recommend to use other books and practice with other CD because this one is just a lose of time."
4,Value for money,"The book had adequate examples to practice, some good study tips and exam strategies. I got a 110 in my TOEFL exam. It was the most cost-efficient.The most confusing thing while buying the book was Barron publishes 3 versions of this book - with audio CD, with CD ROM and only the book. The audio CD version contains audio for all listening sections but no computer-based tests / scoring. I believe the CD ROM version has that.Other things that would be good to have:- a feature to record your speaking section (available with Longman)- a feature to record your written skills and get an automated evaluation."
4,Contents are pretty good staffs.,"I like Barron's book to practice iBT TOEFL test.The Listening section's explanation is wrong, but it does not matter 'cause contents are really, really good.It contains following;1) selected possible iBT TOEFL reading topics2) quite similar to Listening material3) useful words for WritingI do not mention about speaking because it needs partner who listens response.I am satisfied with this contens, but I have one thing that I cannot accept... that is, CD-Rom materials are all the same as materials in the book. If only it had not been the same as book's contens... I'd rate 5stars.Anyway, this will improve your scores."
5,"COSMIC, sexual, spiritual",this cd has to be one of the most beautifully scored cd's and one that is so relaxing to anyone's ear. Jon Anderson from YES sings in some of this cd and his voice with Kitaro's scores are incredible. I have played this for many people and not one person has ever said take this off. Its incredible and it will grow on you. A MUST BUY!
5,Absolutely wonderful.,"I bought this CD on a whim because I liked Jon Anderson, although I had never listened to anything by Kitaro before. I was blown away. This is simply some of the most beautiful, transporting music I have ever heard: mysterious and vast (Symphony of the Forest, A Passage of Life), delicate and ethereal (A Drop of Silence), exotic and stimulating (Agreement, Magical Wave). It is like an extended daydream set to music - or the perfect catalyst for creating one."
4,Kitario's Music,"I think that Kitario's Music helps to paint a aray of mentel images of a time and place that only exists in the relm of the imagination. I used to own an old recording of the album Kitario Dream, but the casset tape had seen it's time and was awful to listen to. I was devastated. So I searched the internet to find an MP3 download or a used copy of this personal tresure, but to no avail. then I remembered your "" Amazon.com "" website. Within secconds I found more then i was looking for. not only used copies but a brand new, never opened copy. Plus I learned that there were other albums of his. So I would just like to thank Amazon.com for helping me to find this CD.Thank you Mr.J Matthews."
1,A prime example of Christian intolerance and foolishness.,"This book is sheer drivel. We Christians must learn to tolerate others, not bash and accuse the beliefs of others as Satanism. It is uncommon knowledge that many New Agers do not even believe in Satan, let alone house and worship him. I recommend this book only to the unenlightened and moronic."
4,used vinyl record,"this was a used record from an aggregate Amazon seller, so it's not a 'stocked' product. anyway, the music is good, and the cover great."
5,Off to a good start,"The author has done a good job with the story line, having multiple story lines and characters within the main story. This could possibly be a ""after school tv special"" showing a strong message to teenagers. Also a great teaching lesson for a high school literature teacher. The book is easy reading, and keeps the reader interested. The author is able to show how a Mom and Dad deal with this tradegy. The tradegy taking you into different worlds, and back out again. The author paints this story in a very believeable fashion."
4,A great little read,I liked this book very well. It gives the reader a series of short stories that opens a window to the human condition of the past. It is informative as well as entertaining.
4,Fits newer models,This set pulls and installs pulleys on newer models. Short compact design allows use on front wheel drive engines. Not Snap ON but not snap on pricing.
1,Confusing,This book is really boring I thought it would be more and it would tell you all the facts . but is has them listed in which catorgory I wanted them in alphbetical order.So dissapointed i wanted get one of theses books.
2,"This is NO Field Guide, pictues are poor","I was looking for a book to help identify the different poison ivy, oak, and sumac, against the ""lookalikes"" like the desciption indicates. This book was written for a 10 year old with NO color pictures, and the pictures are nothing more than poor hand drawn sketches. Not at all a ""Field Guide""."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"NEEDED SOME PHOTOGRAPHS. I STILL COULDN'T DEFINITELY IDENTIFY POISON IVY, OAK OR SUMMAC. BUT I DID KNOW I HAD FOUND IT WHEN I BROKE OUT."
1,DO NOT BUY,Terrible beyond belief. 10 minutes of actual footage (shot with what appears to be a home video camera). The rest (29 min) nothing but commercials for hotels and resturants.This is a horrible video and not worth a single dollar. Beware.
5,A book for those who like to think about religion,"This is a book for those who like to think about religion. Whether you are an atheist or a theist the book will challenge you. Hume arranges powerful arguments on both side of the question, and it is still a matter of scholarly debate what he really believed, however what Hume really believed is less important than the training in critical thinking he offers. This is the kind of book that can change your life"
5,The truth that they will never teach you.,"Hume is a master, one of the most important philosophers ever. In the Natural History, Hume masterfully shows the natural evolution of religion. From its crude beginings of polytheism to the more refined monotheism, comparing the value systems of each. Monotheism has roots and can be traced to a source. He concludes that any rational mind would aviod the unstable houses of religion altogether."
5,THE BEST!,"I own every Confederate Railroad album available and Unleashed is the best! The last album on Atlantic Keep on Rockin was a disapointment, but look what a label change did for these guys. The album starts with Still one Outlaw left and sets the tone for the best country album of the year filled with fun songs like White Trash with money, and the serious Time wasted these guys show everyone else how it should be done! Not ones to hide their personalities or outlaw charm make this album even better.All fans of Toby Keith, Kid Rock, or Hank Williams Jr. should pick this one up, as should everyone else. The first single That's what Brothers do should be played on our country stations."
2,Disappointed,"CR's first release is a classic, and well worth your time. Unleashed sounds different, and is different. In my opinion, not so great. Buy only if you are a dedicated fan..."
3,"Delightful, Informative, A Tad Too Ideological","Good book, well-written, broad in its scope of the mass of contradictions we call Greece. The author describes her first year in Greece, where she and her daughters and husband have taken up residence. She describes the key events during this year and uses each as a launching pad for forays into various aspects of Greek life. There is a fairly strong anti-American and anti-Brit tone always beneath the surface -- some legitimate, stemming from western support of ""The Generals"", the junta which unpopularly ruled Greece for a period. But I sense that the author is at heart a lefty who wants to take a few ideological shots as she goes along. Zinovieff is a masterful writer, who knows when to be blunt and when to be lyrical. Her anthropological insights serve her well -- well enough to dampen some of her left-wing passion."
4,Eurydice Street,"I'm about halfway thru this book. It's about what I expected - a slice of life in a country I have developed a considerable interest in. I'd recommend the book to anyone who has an interest in Greece (bear in mind, that it does NOT take place in the current period of financial crisis). While I've heard people complain about these authors not being Greek and not really understanding everything, that's not the point. Most of us are outsiders to this or any other land but our own but our opinions of places we've been can be very valid within that context. I'm glad I bought this book."
2,Disappointed,I waited 10 years for this book and must admitt that I wasdisappointed. It's not as good and the first two. I found thatit dragged and really didn't make me want to finish it.I do like her newest book Wilding Nights and hope shewill write more in that series.
2,Cover Photo Deceiving of Contents of Other Photos,"This book appears as if ALL the photographs in it will be as outstanding as the cover picture but this is quite deceiving.Considering the quality of the show, price of the book, etc... much more effort and professionalism should have been put into the photography.Very disappointing with a handful of good photographs towards the end of the book."
5,Great Pictures of the best show in the world,"I have just recived this book, and if you have ever seen ""o"" at The Bellagio and loved it and want good memories of it, this is the book you want! Buy this book if you love Cirque Du Soleil! I have seen the show 3 times and this a book of high quaility pictures taken from the show! Thanks"
5,Barthes the poet,"Reading this long essay, I was reminded of Barthes' contention that he was not a literary critic--this work goes farther than most anything that passes for literary criticism nowadays. This is a beautiful, concise essay on what makes reading pleasurable, something most critics wouldn't dare to tackle. But Roland Barthes is no critic--he's a philosopher and a poet, a gifted writer whose words desire your reading (and you'll desire the words) as much as they illuminate that desire itself. It's a rare person who can explain literature while creating it. Barthes is one such person, which is just another reason he's no literary critic."
4,Very Fine,"The text is pleasurable. The text is bliss. Barthes perforates the being of the text, he pinpoints the ineffability of the greatness of the truly great writers. He writes about Nietzsche, about Sade, about Flaubert, and many others. Unlike the general dynamic of French post-modernity and post-structuralism, Barthe's style and tone are unusually playful and entertaining. This treatise flows with the lucid readability of a good William Carlos Williams poem.Barthes relates reading to orgasm (petite mal=small death in Lacanian terms), reading is related to the act of striping, to seduction.""The pleasure of the text is not the pleasure of the corporeal striptease or of narrative suspense"" (pg. 10).""I am interested in language because it wounds or seduces me"" (pg.38)And this text will seduce you too."
2,An aikido book that requires a new edition.,"I have various versions of this book and have never thought that it adequately reflected what Kisshomaru Ueshiba could really teach us about aikido. There are techniques that one would not usually found taught in many North American dojo, and a heavy emphasis on the Japanese terminology that accompany them. These facts make the book a valuable addition to any martial artist's library. Some minor editing mistakes and the lack of a personal approach to aikido by the author make it also one of the least motivating books on aikido I have read. Hopefully the Doshu (Ueshiba) will have the book edited at least one again, and will accompany the current text with some more personalized reflections of what aikido has meant to him personally."
4,The Aikido Doshu talks about his father's art.,"Kisshomaru Ueshiba is the son of Morihei Ueshiba O-Sensei, the founder of Aikido, and is the current Aikido Doshu (Master of the Way) and head of the Aikikkai organization.The book is intended to be a help to beginners and explains basic things like breakfalls, stances, basic techniques and even goes as far as showing some unarmed defenses to attacks from jo and ken (stick and sword).It also includes a chapter on the life of O-Sensei and how he came to create Aikido. A very interesting reading."
2,Not as advertised,These sandals are advertised as having leather uppers. They do not. Shame on Amazon.
2,Meaning of Sports ??,"I really felt this was waste of money. As I recall, I purchased it in response to a Bob Edwards interview. I can only say that Edwards is a very skilled interviewer who was able to make this superficial book sound ""meaningful"". I read a lot about football, baseball and basketball which I already knew--virtually nothing about their ""meaning"" or significance to society."
3,Nice looking teakettle,"Although this kettle splashes a bit when it pours, it makes up for it with its good looks! I chose it as I wanted a kettle with a fluted spout which is so hard to find. Yet this spout splashes as do most of the kettles I have owned. The heat resistant handle is a nice touch and this is a fine kettle for the price."
1,The skin scratches the disc,"These skins fit a bit loose, so when the disc spins, the surface of the skin itself ends up scratching the disc!"
2,Good for most things,"This works for all dvd players except for the portable dvd player, which is the one we most wanted it to work on...due to that being the one my kid uses in the car and the dvds get scratched at that time."
5,5 stars must read,"okayb first off i just got this today so far its half good and half bad it plays my ps2 games pretty fine a little noise on some but not enough to effect the way it plays for use of ps2 games in the ps2 slim when ps2 slim is modded 5 stars i don't know if it plays in the slim when the slim ps2 is not modded, i tryed to play dvds in my modded ps2 slim with d-skin's on and it won't read the disk and i put it in a new dvd player it would not work so for use of protecting your dvds on a mac dvd player ps2 or laptop 1 star. for use of protecting ps2 games 5 stars... one of the reasons i rated this 5 stars i because its the thing that protects it while it plays"
3,"Great Idea, But, still far from Perfect............","This is without a doubt a Great way to protect your valuable data discBut, it all depends on what type of discs you wana protectIt works perfect with Audio CD's,DVD's it's not so good (4 out of the 20) D Skins didn't workon Both XBox and XBox 360 it's a 50/50 luck of the draw kind of dealI Highly recommend this for CD's the others not so much......."
3,It's not that bad!,"This movie is the usual Lupin the 3rd movie, not too much different than all the others. The story is the down-side of the movie, in my oponion it's an over-used plot, searching for treasure basically. The animation is not bad, the typical Lupin the 3rd animation. The music is not bad either much better than Akira, and kinda catchy. Overall if you like Lupin the 3rd there's no reason why you wouldn't like this movie!"
1,"No good, broke the first time I used it","I took this pole out and got to use it for about 30 minutes before I finally caught a small fish, and the pole broke in half! I've been fishing for years and never had this happen, and it wasn't even a big fish!"
1,Don't waste your time,"From start to finish, this story made no sense. The characters were annoying, the ""surprise plot twist"" in the garden made no sense to the rest of the story. There were several errors found throughout the book. The characters were unrealistic as was the plot. I realize this was a first time author, but this was really poorly developed."
1,Don't bother with these!,There is virtually no protection from the cold. These shoes are lined with rabbit fur which matts immediately and offers little insulation. Stay with the rubber booties. These are a waste of money.
5,"Well Built, Great Value","I purchased these to be bolted onto a 2x4 in the bed of my truck for transport to/from the trails. Works like a charm. I was skeptical as to how well they would be made figuring that I'll get what I pay for and boy was I wrong. These are made from 1/4"" steel ""L"" Bracket and have three mounting holes drilled in the bottom to accommodate a wide variety of mounting possibilities. The only ""downside"" is that they do not have a locking skewer, but I knew that when I purchased them. I doubt that these will ever ware out, but if they do I'll gladly buy another pair."
3,Title somewhat misleading,"This book has much useful information. However, the title implies that it is a general discussion of ornamentation when, in fact, it mostly deals with the ornamentation found in CPE Bach's A Minor Flute Concerto. There is only a short discussion of ornamentation not found in this concerto. Also, many of the musical examples do NOT include the original score, only how the author would realize the ornamentation. This is not helpful if you don't own the 'A Minor Concerto' or if you want to apply what is discussed in the book to other music. So, while the information is generally interesting, a more apt title would be something like: ""Realizing the Ornamentation in CPE Bach's A Minor Flute Concerto: Comparing the views of CPE Bach and JJ Quantz."""
3,"Detailed book, badly presented","I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand it excels in terms of content, tackling the more complex issues of .NET remoting including the creation of custom channel sinks; on the other hand it is severely let down by its poor presentation.The book doesn't come with a CD, although viewing the code in its entirity is essential to understanding the issues presented in this book. Fortunately the code is available for download from the net.The authors often fail to provide a substantial overview of the particular topics discussed in this book and present pieces of code in a piecemeal fashion which has no relevance until you reach the end of the chapter and are able to piece it all together.This is a good book, but if you are new to the topic of .NET remoting, as I was, then prepare to dip into MSDN and spend time reviewing the code, in order to get a true understanding of this topic."
1,THIS BOOK IS FOR .NET 1.0 -,This book is written for .net 1.0 and the samples will not work with .net 1.1 without help from you.
2,.NET Remoting-Too complex Period,"You have got to be kidding. The examples are complex, not well explained, and basically the context is disjointed with no transition between subjects or chapter contents. This cannot be an introduction to Remoting, and is definitely not an intermediate introduction either. That leaves EXPERIENCED NET REMOTING Developers. Note I mentioned both ""EXPERIENCED"", ""NET"" and ""REMOTING"", though I doubt there would be use for those folks either. Cannot explain why this book would get ONE positive comment. I have yet to try the examples, but the way each example is explained is bizarre and confusing."
3,I Loved it When I Was Little.,"This movie was the perfect movie for its time.The far superior sequel has given me a dim view on it though.The effects arnt to good and the music blows.Worth rental so you can see Anacondas,but not a keeper."
4,Fact or Fiction? YOU Decide...,"Suppose that following the upheaval of the Revolution, a single Romanov daughter eluded the clutches of those who murdered her father, the ruling Czar of Russia, to make a new life for herself hunting mammoth-sized snakes deep in the heart of the Amazon jungle; that's the intriguing premise of this live-action sequel to the the animated hit, ANASTASIA. Never feeling totally safe and always looking over her shoulder, the young Russian princess, (Jennifer Lopez in a knockout performance), adopts a new look, changes her name to Anna Conda, and embarks on a treacherous, peril-filled journey to meet her destiny - a giant snake. Entertaining from the first frame to the last, ANACONDA is also part history lesson and makes for one of the more interesting suppositions of what truly became of the heiress to the Romanov throne."
1,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE!,"WHEN I CONSIDER THAT THE REVIEWERS WHO GAVE THIS MOVIE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE, NOT JUST OPERATING VEHICLES ON PUBLIC STREETS, BUT POTENTIALLY HAVING CHILDREN AND THUS, CONTAMINATING THE REST OF THE WORLD, I SHUDDER AND QUAKE. IF YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE, PLEASE: REMOVE THE MAYONAISE SANDWICH FROM YOUR MOUTH, TURN OFF JERRY SPRINGER, AND START READING A BOOK, ANY BOOK. IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO TURN THAT 3 POUNDS OF GREY MATTER INSIDE YOUR SKULL INTO A FUNCTIONING ORGAN."
4,It's not as bad as everyone says it is.,"There is no way that this is the best movie ever, nor is it the worst. I don't understand why so many people are down on this movie. It has a lot of action, and is pretty suspenseful, granted there are better movies out there, but this is a very good one in its own right.A boat full of people are making a documentary about a lost South American tribe. The group happens upon a skitsofrenic who is oppsesed with capturing this gigantic snake. He eventually takes over the boat. This leads up until the very end: a showdown between Jenifer Lopez, a giant snake, and Jon Voight.Don't let anyone fool you, this is a very good movie, not the best, but still very good. You would be well advised to give this movie the benifit of the doubt."
1,i wish stars could be negative,"ACK! i have a few questions, like how can the guy who was hit by a trank. dart not drown, wake up, swim faster thAn the boat and still haven enogh time to set some traps?"
1,And THIS got the green light...how?,"To put it short, ANACONDA is bad. Absolutely mind-numbingly bad. It's not even worthy of being a ripoff of JAWS, because the mention of that would insult the much better movie. The sad part? Jon Voight, Jennifer Lopez, and Bill Paxton are all good actors. It's not even worth of being called a guilty pleasure. The only pleasure I feel is the pleasure that it's over, and the ""guilty"" part? I'm guilty of actually watching this. Movie Police, lock me up."
5,large snakes that you don't want to mess with,This is a good movie that you will never get tired off. It has action and suspense that will keep you on your toes throughout the movie.
2,JLO JLO...oh and the snake too....,Let's just say that this movie is NOT a msterpiece however it does have some good points well ok one actually Jennifer Lopez rocks.The special effects for the snake are pretty good too but the other actors are totaly cheesy and the story is very basic.
2,Anaconda- it stars a rapper. and goes downhill from there.,"Well, the best I can say about this movie is it's an entertaining B movie. And that's more than generous. The plot is stupid, the snake is horribly unrealistic, the acting is truly crap, and I won't even comment on the realism. I know it is a movie, and thus it does not have to be realistic, but they should do better than what they did. The snake was so unrealistic that it made the movie more of a sci-fi movie than an action show. In my opinion, that's bad. And How about the cast? J-lo and Ice Cube? What's this, the ghetto all star cast? Well, ghetto is right. This is a terrible show. However, it is entertaining for a while, so it's worth watching if it's on TV, or if you go to $... super tuesday at Mr. Movies. But other than that, there's no reason to watch this show."
2,I am fed up with the killer animal movies,"Hey, producers... Stop making killer animal movies please. Snakes, sharks, piranhas, bees, killer insects etc. OR try to write a better scenario. Even jennifer lopez could not save the day!"
3,Good to watch once,This movie i would honestly say had its good parts. I'm not gonna say so that i can spoil it for you but I would not recommend going out and buying it. Rent it. its an okay movie. Jennifer Lopez isn't looking her best in this movie. That's also another reason that this movie wasn't the greatest.
2,Not What I really Expected,This movie wasn't all that i expected it to be. I figured that a movie about a killer snake would tell me something about a scary movie but it wasn't. This was the most pathetic excuse for a movie that i have ever seen. I will admit though that this movie had its moments but there were just some pure boring parts that i think made this movie as bad as I saw it. I gave this movie 2 Stars
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:With terrible special effects, a leaden pace, no interesting characters beside John Voigt's campy river rat, and a minimum of suspense, Anaconda is barely above the level of direct-to-video and certainly not worth watching."
3,Not a bad movie,"This movie its quite good in my opinion. Even though the critics gave it mostly bad reviews and the snakes look fake at times this movie has some solid acting and good action sequences. The story (if there's any in this type of films) ain't that bad, especially for a movie of that genre. Although many people may not like this movie, this movie did started another branch in the genre of animal flicks (python, boa, python 2, boa vs. python, etc.). Recommend this and its sequel as well. (Anacondas: Hunt for the Blood Orchid)."
2,The Worst horror movie since Orca,"This is the worst horror movie I have seen since Orca. The snake looks cheesy and you can tell it is fake especially at the end when It comes down from the celling. It has some corney gag in it and very little gore.There is one nasty party when the anadaconda regregates the hunter and he winks at the girl. The snake catching on fire and moving is interesting but cheezy.If you like snake horror movies I recommend you King Cobra which is a little better than Anaconda. The best choice are Python, Phyton II and boa."
2,This movie bites.,"Ok, it's not all that bad. In truth, it's probably exactly what you would expect. Jon Voight takes a stab at playing the snake hunting scum-bag, while pretending to help out. Eric Stoltz is fine, but not around much. Jennifer Lopez does the same job as any non-actor could. Ice Cube more or less plays himself. Owen Wilson who normally is hilarious, never really even cracks a joke in this one. Kari Wuhrer I like, but she never shows any skin, which she normally does in movies. Another let down. As for the snake, it's part rubber, and part computer graphics, but never that realistic. The whole group is in the jungle to shoot a documentary before they get into snake trouble. In short, if you enjoy movies with giant spiders, rats, crocodiles, or bats, you should like this one too."
2,Stupid!,"This movie is pretty stupid and unbeilvable, the snakes don't look real, John Voight played a great bad guy as always, that's the only thing going for it, J.Lo gave a C performance as always, Ice Cube was annoying."
1,Unrealistic,"I have seen real anacondas, I have pet real anacondas. Real anacondas aren't big enough to eat a human older than 8 years old and are super slow snakes. Other than that it's an okay movie."
1,Ice Cube and J.Lo are the only interesting aspects!..,"The only reason why I watched the movie entirely is because of Ice Cube and Jennifer Lopez who both could have spent their time on another picture, but no they had to spend their time on this waste of disc space. If you're an ice cube or j.lo fan then don't watch this movie watch:All About the Benjamins or Barbershop for an Ice Cube movieorEnough and Angel Eyes for a Jennifer Lopez movie.Those are highlight movies for the both of them.DON'T, i repeat DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
4,An instant Camp Classic.,"When a Documentary Crew (Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Jonathan Hyde, Owen Wilson, Kari Wuhrer, Eric Stoltz and Vicent Casterllanos) are going to the Amazon for the search of a tribe of Legendary Indians, But when they pick up a Mysterious Snake Pocher (Jon Voight at his most campiest role), he`s on the Hunt of a Forty Foot Snake, which it`s has been following them since the Boat Trip.Directed by Luis Liosa (Sniper, The Specialist) has made one of the most campy Horror films ever made. Even the Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) are more campy. A Box Office Hit in the Spring of 1997. This film will not be loved by everyone in the modern audiences but Fans of Camp Classics will love this one. Super 35. Grade:B+."
4,Anaconda vs. Jon Voight: Who steals a scene better?,"In Anaconda, we are treated to many visual pleasures: some beautiful Amazon scenery, a 60 foot snake which looks very cool in computer mode, but really fake in model form, Jon Voight getting regurgitated, and Jennifer Lopez walking around in khaki shorts. Mmmm, Lopez. Jon Voight is awesome as a South American snake hunter who is not what he seems. Every time we don't see the snake, Voight fills the gap and tides us over nicely. Then, the snake comes along and crushes and kills people and other jungle life in increasingly entertaining ways. The plot: fairly simple, but this is not The Usual Suspects. Just show us the Snake!"
1,One of history's WORST films!!!,"I've viewed a lot of films over the years and this is simply one of the WORST EVER! I saw the film about 6 months ago, and I wanted to take time to make sure i disliked it before I trashed it. I can't lie - it's terrible. I really like Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy), but his acting in this film is pathetic. Obviously, he needed the work. The plot is cheap imitation, the acting is just sad (yes, even jennifer lopez), and the special effects are unforgiveable. This film was a complete waste of time."
3,Killer Snake!!!!,"Being a snake lover, I enjoyed this movie. Of course the plus to this movie is the fact that J. Lo plays in it and also John Voight. Both give a good performance, especially Voight. Great special effects, Cool snake and good cast. Although not a horror movie, Anaconda delivers some scares and suspense. Good movie!"
3,Another monster movie...,"Remember the seemingly endless stream of monster movies that were rushed into cinemas after the sucess of JAWS? Well, if you do, you'll remember that they were all entertaining rubbish movies (save for the excellent PIRANHA). Which brings us to ANACONDA, a throwback to those old cheesy B-movies. Starring Jennifer Lopez, Jon Voight and Ice Cube, the film is basically a by-the-numbers pick 'em off monster movie, with both originality and subtlety nowhere to be seen. But it is fun, and the special effects are impressive, if sometimes unconvincing. And it's great to see Jon Voight overacting to the extreme. However, this is one of those films that seems more entertaining when watching it at night, when you're too tired to care about wooden dialouge and plot holes. Set your brain to half-mode and enjoy."
3,Watchable B movie junk.,"This movie should only be watched on a Saturday night, because that's the only way that you're going to fully enjoy watching this B movie. The special effects are B movie type,the story is B movie type,and the acting is B movie type, with Jon Vioght giving one of the wierdest performances of his career. Jennifer Lopez is servicable, and Ice Cube could've been funnier than they protrayed his character. Overall, a good piece of junk that can be watched and enjoyed followed by another piece of junk sequel."
1,Top ten...,"Top Ten Worst Films Of All Time. This is easily one of the absolute worst films of all time. Their is no talent outside of Eric Stoltz, who has a whole in his throat for most of the movie, yet still finds some way to talk, and Jon Voight who plays his stupidest character ever, but with modest results. The snakes are nearly invisible for most of the movie, the special effects are horrible, there were so numerous editing problems that by the end of the movie, they had piled up so high I couldn't keep count anymore. Jennifer Lopez has no talent. She is not good at anything she does. Voice filters and whatnot on CD's are fine, but just watch one of her Saturday Night Live performances. Awful! It's just a horrendous movie, that, if it had a high budget, wasted it on catering because they certainly didn't spend any of it on art direction/set direction. This movie just plain stinks."
1,This movie sucks.,"Seeing this on the shelf somewhere, not seeing it yet. You might think, ""whoa, this movie looks pretty awsome."" But for the people that did see it. Would know it sucked unless you liked Jaws 3. Its extremley fake. It got way out of hand. It's so damn corny. Ice Cube can't act worth a damn. I couldn't even sit through the whole thing. I had to see the ending on HBO. Damn I wish I never saw the ending. It's so damn fake. If you haven't seen this movie yet, then keep it that way."
2,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT","I believe all movies should get a chance. Most film critics don't beleive that, using hype, budget, production difficulty, and false over-expectation to shoot a movie down before it even has a chance to defend itself. And I'll admit, in it's original theatrical release I didn't give this movie much of a chance. Then I watched it on HBO and thought it was okay, better than I thought at least. The actors are good actors but they seemed to just not care about this movie, the effects are good but anaconda's couldn't never move so fast and agressivly, the story is good, but if you do a movie like this make the snake behave correctly, get actors who give a crap, and don't have such a corny human villian."
3,Hokey Fun,"This movie doesn't need to win any awards, and it certainly doesn't need to try because this movie is not about that. It's about giving an old-fashioned horror movie a twist. ""Anaconda"" is a lot of fun, and the special effects are pretty impressive. The acting is actually pretty good for this kind of a movie. Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez, Jon Voight, and many other interesting and usually funny characters do a fine job. Don't expect a lot from this movie, but expect a good time."
2,Is this movie really rated PG-13?!,Well I thought this movie was bad. The special effects were sooo bad they made you laugh. But it was very violent and the language was high which I thought would be R rating
1,"THEY DID!!! ONF THE WORST ""MONSTER"" MOVIES OF ALL TIMES!!","THis is unbeliavable. Jon Voight being in it...Everything is so bad, so ludicrous, so lame and mean. THe acting, the sanke, the plot, the ending, the beginning, the special effects, the scenario. My God, it's awful!! It's so awful that, even resisting, you'll find a smile forming on your face, so funny it is. So, I'm giving the note the producers surely wwanted to take when they shoot this: one star. Congratulations !!"
3,It is not bad It is not good.,This movie is not bad becuse Mrs.Lopez acts in this movie and some scenes are so watchable.It is not so good because its sfx are not so well designed and the snakes are not looked so real.
1,one of the worst films I have ever seen.,"I was dragged along by friends to see this in a theater. Because they were friends I forced myself to sit through it. There is no real plot and I frankly cannot understand why Jon Voight is in it. Ice Cube, who has done good work elsewhere, is totally wasted in this. The best thing about the film is the not- all-that convincing computer graphics...in short: utter garbage!If you have escaped seeing ANACONDA thus far, consider yourself blessed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!ps: Amazon, you really need a no-star rating! In fact, you need a NEGATIVE rating!"
2,nice attacks but lame movie,i kind of liked the movie but it wasint that good attacks were nice but the movie was boring i dont think the movie is not worth it to buy
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,I love any movie with Jon Voight with the exception of Anaconda. John Voight has acted in classics such as Deliverence and Midnight Cowboy. Why on earth would he agree to act in this movie. I read the case in the video store and it sounded like a very exciting and suspenseful movie. Boy was I wrong!! I think that this movie would have been much better without the extremely fake looking special effects. Also I think that if the script and direction would have been better thought out then this movie would have been watchable. The premise was there but it was ruined by poor production. This could have been a really cool movie.
4,a guilty pleasure,"this film is very intense,funny,well-crafted,and well-acted. of course it's no jaws,but it's not supposed to be."
4,The snake is great fun to watch! I loved it!,I really enjoyed the movie. The snake looks really scary - particulalrly the last 20 minutes are really awsome and full of action. A must see for those who love movies like jaws and Godzilla. Highly recommended.
2,"FantasticDan and Bugster say ""J Lo is hot, movie is not""","At long last Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube team up to make one of the greatest thrillers of all time. Ok, that is an overstatement, a tremendous overstatement. In fact the only reason it got two stars is because we found it to be so bad its good. Plus J Lo's not bad looking. Jon Voights overacts and speaks with a very strong fake-sounding acent in the irritating role of the villian/snake hunter. As far as giant snake movies go Anacondas at the top but its a really short list. All it beats is made for video [junk] like Python. If you need to see a movie in which Jon Voights is regurgitated out of a giant snake rent it, otherwise stay clear."
5,"Jennifer Lopez in ""Anaconda""","A documentary film crew is terorized by a giant snake in the Amazon, which they find thenselves trying to capture after rescuing a crazy shipwrecked big game hunter!"
1,This Film Bites Worst Than Snake Puppets!,"The only thing good about this movie is the beginning where we get to see little naughty bits of J'Lo. Other than that, the acting is to put it nicely horrible. We're talking Manos the Hands of Fate horrible and it doesn't get any worse than that...at least it's not supposed to. John Vioght (spelled his last name wrong dang!) and his fake...accent will have you laughing if not gaging. He talks like he's a carny at a cheap mall lot carnival and the snakes ah' the anacondas! Nice puppets folks and liked it when John blinked his eyes after being partially digested and spit out by the puppet. Don't buy this movie, you'll feel cheap and dirty afterwards!"
2,"Anaconda, puh, rather grass snake!","This movie is an awful one. It is very predictable and the way the snake acts and looks is so horribly fake. How can a wasp get into your mouth and it is poisonous? How can a snake be burnt and injured in many ways and it still does'nt die? It has a few good cast members but this movie just gets dull after awhile and incredibley far-fetched.I would not recommend this ridiculous movie. Get a better movie and one that you enjoy. If you enjoy this movie, well, I don't mind."
2,Why did I watch this movie,"There is always that movie that takes a theme and grinds it into the ground. This movie ends the ""oversized creature kills a lot of people"" genre."
2,Way too far-fetched.,"I liked parts of this movie, but I thought it was way too far-fetched. Especially when you could see that guys body through the snake. You really wouldn't beable to see his mouth wide open or his eve sockets through the snakes body."
1,Poor little film,"This movie is so bad that it ends being funny. I only wish the producers have taken some time doing research. It's really annoying to see how south american animals (like piranhas, jiboias, snakes, AND the anaconda) are portraited like terrible beasts.A real anaconda would probably die of a heart atack if it ever happens to see its Hollywood counterpart...but, in the end, this movie has made me laugh a lot."
3,"The 1st hour's a bore, but the actors & the snake ham it up","Anaconda wasn't that bad, for a film that intentionally makes cheese out of snake. I bet you the director didn't know that after an anaconda eats a large animal, such as a human being, it has to lie still for up to three years before moving again, not to mention the fact that when they do, they go less than 3 miles per hour. That's quite a bit in the butt of realism, isn't it? But still, even though the first hours's a bore, and they occasionally make Jennifer Lopez look like bad, it's made up for with a pretty cool, albeit unrealistic, climax."
2,TWO STARS FOR TRYING,"I gave this movie two stars for trying. But really I cant believe I wasted money on renting it. It has got to be one of the worst movies when it comes to being realistic. You can oviously tell the snake is a fake, it looks like they cut it out and pasted it on the screen it doesnt even fit in. I am horrified of snakes and love a good movie but this was the biggest rip off I have ever seen. And think it would have been better if they would have spent more time on trying to make it look real. Please don't waste your money on this movie."
3,Not to good not to bad...,"There isn't much to talk about. This movie which actually stars Jennifer Lopez is not Jaws. But yet I can't say its awful its right in the middle. Jon Voight was a fair bad guy. Ice Cube is a bit under used but all together its okay. The thing that boosted the entertainment for me was that my expectations were so low and it turned out to be a better movie than I anticipated. Action goers will not be disapointed unfortunately horror fans you will find this to be just as bad as the 3rd ""Jaws"" sequal."
5,One of my favorite movies.,ALL RIGHT THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO SAY IS MOVE OVER WHITNEY HOUSTON HERE COMES JENNIFER LOPEZ.I THINK SHE DID A GREART JOB IN THIS MOVIE AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ALL YOU SMART PEOPLE OUT THERE!
1,I would rather be squeezed to death than watch this again!,"This ""movie"" deserves 0 stars. It is extremely cheesy. The actors are about as horrible as any B,C,D,or Z movie. while watching I was hoping a snake would slither out of the TV screen and bite my genitals, while injecting them full of painfull venom. I rented this movie back in the day, and all I can remember about this movie is it sucked really bad, and they spent way too much time on that lousy raft/boat.I bought a lot of laserdiscs, and to my dismay, this movie was in the pile....I will never tarnish my laserdisc's heritage by subjecting such a block-buster flop to it."
3,"Blood, vomit and J-Lo in a wet t-shirt......","OK, the movie was not all that great, but there was some good action and I liked seeing Jon Voight being puked up by the snake. I wonder, if his daughter Angelina Jolie had been in the movie, would the snake have eaten her too? If so, I would have auditioned for the role of the snake. As it is we have to settle for J-Lo in a wet t-shirt, which ain't all bad. And Ice Cube ain't a bad actor either. Worth a watch."
3,Snake looked to fake,The Snake's movements were too exagerated. It moved way to fast to make it believable. If only Spielburg did this movie instead (like Jurasic Park's dinosaurs). I still thought it was a fun rental as long as you don't take it too seriously.
2,I tried to like it . . .,". . . but when I finished watching it, I wasn't fully entertained. I had fun watching Tremors and Deep Blue Sea, but somehow I found Anaconda to be quite dull. What I DID like about the film was that it starred Jon Voight, and the giant snake was pretty bad@$$ and frightening in some quarters. but that's about it. J. Lo, Owen Wilson, Jonathan Hyde, Kari Wuhrer, and Ice Cube acted very 2-dimensional; sometimes they were so annoying, that I actually wanted them to be eaten by the anaconda.It was overall a mediocre movie. Voight and the snake are the only adventages, but they simply can't make up for the rest of the things in this movie.Grade: D+"
3,Fact or fiction...,"I saw this when it first came out at the movies. Decent entertainment if you don't confuse the behavior of REAL anaconda with the onscreen antics shown here. Good acting overall, some pretty hammy (Jon Voight) and some not acting at all (Ice Cube).For those looking to learn the habits of anacondas- watch National Geographic instead. For those looking to kill a few hours watching a no-brainer thats got a few thrills, a pretty leading lady and a easy to hate villian, than this just might be worth checking out."
4,"Good map, but...","Generally this would be a very good map. Has a nice contour every 100 meters. That gives you instant idea about the terrain you going to travel thru. It is a trekking map, so I expect that the trekking features are well exposed. Trails are very well exposing in bright yellow color. The distance is mark in hours. Lakes, glaciers, peaks and valleys are clear to read and easy to find. All names are in nice big font, except Camping's. I do have a problem to find them and some of them are totally invisible. The font is too weak and too small. Careful, it is printed on a semi gloss paper, rips easy."
5,CHRISTMAS GIFT ALL YEAR LONG,I received this robe as a Christmas gift from my son this year and each evening I can't wait to slip into it. The robe envelops you with softness and warmth and it reminds me of my son. The shawl collar is very flattering and although the robe can keep you very warm . . .it is not heavy. The arms can be rolled or folded to whatever length you desire. I have tacked mine in place with thread the color of my amethyst robe. There are nice deep pockets on either side of the robe and a nice long sash. If I was to use one word to describe this robe it would be PLUSH. It is well worth the price.
2,a big ass dictionary,"thats all it it. its tough to read, lots of subjects that seem to just be roughly organized; difficult to use effectively."
5,Great for all age believers! A must read!,I am loving this book. Eugene lends such great insight into why christian reading is so important. I believe it's a very foundational and formational book for young and aged christians.Read this book!
3,Eat the Bible,"Mr. Peterson was not inspired by the hippie Abbe Hoffman's 'Steal This Book' which was clearly self referential.He certainly appears to be a giant in the realm of thoughtful modern day Christianity.His experience as a long time Pastor brought him to the place of believing that Christians, while very possibly being well intended individuals, have to a great extent constructed a faith based on something other than opening to scripture and responding to it, in its entirety.While he admits there are other ways out there, none should be considered a reasonable alternative to Christianity (his passing reference to 18th century Jesuit reasoning, and Zen Buddhist practice come to mind).He treats briefly here the question of, 'Who, then, is my neighbor'. The training was the chosen people were neighbors to each other, so it seems. They have stuck with that. We've had too many bloody wars among Christian nations, though never on the heads of lecto divina practitioners."
1,In love with himself,"While the book had some valid points, Peterson's main thrust seemed to be promotion of his own Bible translation and criticism of other scholars. The argument that ""X says Y, but he's pretentious so don't listen to him."" I bought this to read for a book group and our response was pretty similiar. While it persuade me to sit down and read the Bible more regularly it didn't teach me much about ""the art of spiritual reading"". It just told it was important to be grounded in the scriptures."
3,More than mildly entertaining: A relatively original work.,"Although a remarkably depressing story, with few characters you can actually empathize with, in many ways it was a pleasant departure from some of the traditional serial killer and ""screenplay"" style thrillers.Being set back in a time before mine (1960s), in a city that I have only visited (Boston), I cannot vouch for its authenticity, but I can say that it seemed quite a beleivable cast and environment -- perhaps a little ""hokey"" at times when references to the hippie movement, tripping, and the drug culture are involved.The most disconcerting point I found was that the story never really concluded. The book ended, and we are given some information on what happens to the characters, but I can't help feeling that one or more entire chapters were left out of the back of my copy."
2,One-dimensional characters in search of a movie deal,"Cliched caricatures vie for the attention of Scorcese, or at least Ben Affleck, in this smug, reactionary hack-job. Aside from its self-satisfied, cloying style, the story also suffers from a paternalistic attitude toward women, pubescent comprehension of recent history, and complete inability to put together original, convincing dialog."
2,The words read smoothly but the story lacks power,"The words read as natural as the spoken word, there is no complaint there. Even mixing Greek and British legends/lore went smoothly and made the story interesting by association. But I was highly disappointed in the binding of these legends he brought together. The story was weak and not conclusive (leading to future books) and his portrayal of the great legends was poor."
1,Tastes like cardboard,"Sociables (and the other products in this line, such as Vegetable Thins and the bacon ones) used to be a tasty snack. But around 2001 (ahem), Nabisco changed this entire product line. Ever since then, Sociables and the other products in this series have all tasted exactly the same: like cardboard. Now they're totally and completely inedible.Why this change hasn't been remarked upon by the consuming public is a mystery to me, because the change was so sudden and unmistakable.To this day, I am infuriated by the drop in quality of Sociables."
3,Okay but not exceptional,I enjoy this series of books but found the Hershey entry to be sketchy with wild gaps in the historical continuity and quality of the photos and a mediocre text.
2,Disappointed,"I was not at all happy with this ring when it arrived. It did not look at all like the picture, but flatter and rougher around the edges. Please note that the braiding does not go all the way around. This is clear in the picture, but I did not notice before I ordered it. Also, the sizing was a bit on the small side."
2,Dissappointed,"I ordered Sunday afternoon, it arrived Tuesday, which was fantastic, but the spray nozzle was missing so not happy. It was July 3 so I didnt get rep from manufacturer til 2 days later. The company was great, sent part right away, no problems from them. The steamer however was a huge dissappointment. The steam ""meandered"" out, was not forceful nor plentiful in the least, after 5 minutes in one small area of a blouse the wrinkles remained. Tried leaving steamer on for over 15 minutes to ""heat up"" and work up more steam, no go. It is an ok product quality wise and the company was responsive, it just didnt perform well at all. Returned product."
3,Fabric Steamer,It sputters a lot but it does give good steem. I was exspecting more I guess . Not bad for the money.
5,Very highly recommended for baseball buffs,"Opening Day At Great American Ball Park by Cincinnati Reds baseball enthusiast Dann Stupp is an exciting celebration of Cincinnati's Great American Ball Park openeing day. Dazzling colorful photography and a sprinkling insightful asides fill the pages of this visual celebration of the grand sport of baseball, as well as the athletes who strive to excel, and the fans who love the thrill of watching teams compete to be the very best they can. Opening Day At Great American Ball Park is very highly recommended for baseball buffs in general, and Cincinnati Reds fans in particular!"
3,Snappy little thriller for teens,"The late Paul Zindel, most famous for his Pulitzer Prize winning playwriting, ended up his very prolific writing career with this series of murder mysteries aimed at adolescent readers. THE SCREAM MUSEUM inaugurates the series, narrated by hot shot teen sleuth P.C. Hawke and his equally brainy sidekick McKenzie. In Book 1 the kids' friend Tom, a slow-witted custodian at the musuem where P.C.'s dad works, is accused of murdering entomologiest Conchetta Farr. P.C. and McKenzie, aware of Tom's essentially gentle nature, know this cannot be the case and set out to discover the real killer.This is nothing special, and it certainly does not rank among Zindel's finer works for young people, but it has an agreeable pace and a nice sense of how teens think and live life in the early 21st century. Best of all the narrator and his friend are eminently likable and believable characters.This would make for a good intro for young people into the mystery genre."
3,"Good Story, Poor Logic","Zindel does not meet his usual quality of writing in this book. In the first chapter, P.C. says that his father left town yesterday, then says that his father's been out of town for a week. I also doubt that P.C., a high school junior, would have Jesus, a 13-year-old computer wiz, for a best friend. And the relationship with Jesus seems to be for P.C.'s benefit primarily. I will warn my junior high students that this book is not as good as others by Paul Zindel before they read it. I don't know whether I will invest in the rest of the series for my classroom library or not. The story was entertaining, but I feel that Zindel did not take the time to think carefully during the writing process. Take your time, Paul - you have great ideas to get kids reading!"
4,s.s.gotenks3!!!,"we all know that goku can reach super sayain 3 but gotenks?! amazing! this was my favorite movie until i got fusion-the last sayian. anyway, super buu creates a hole and then gotenks does and when gotenks and piccolo get out buu ate everybody! since buu ate bulma gotenks is angry and they fight! buy this movie and find out for yourself!"
3,Not his typical,"I was disappointed. The CD is more like movie-mood music, not the lively, jazzy music that he usually plays with the Armenian Navy Band."
5,This is a Magnetic Kit including a great instructional book,"HOW TO USE MAGNETS AN ADVANCED BIOMAGNETIC KITUse on aches, pains, glands, organs, acupuncture points.Discover how magnets can improve your life!This kit consists of6 Cookie Magnets 6 Domino Magnets 6 Magnetic Rectangles 6 Small Neodymium DiscsThis kit comes with a 40 page amply illustrated manual which describes where to apply these magnets to glands and organs, chakras, acupuncture meridians, and trigger points.This is the most comprehensive manual yet to be written on magnetic therapy. It's not a cookbook; it gives the key places to apply magnets and the general principles for their use.The manual also describes the technique for determinining which polarity to use. Developed by Drs. Richard and Mary Broeyeringmeyer, this technique is not yet generally known. Other uses of the magnets forautomobile, household water, and plants are described in this manual."
1,Simply horrible....,I should have checked reviews before I've bought this stud finder... it does absolutely nothing.
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"I've owned this so-called stud finder for several years and have had better luck using an old magnetic stud finder. Occasionally, this may locate a stud but the only way to prove it is to pound a nail into the drywall. Sometimes it hits wood, most of the time it doesn't. Doesn't matter whether you use the ""deep scanning"" option or the stud option. You get what you pay for."
3,Stud sensor - not so deep,"Zircon 61902 works great on sheetrock walls,but does not very good on plaster/lath walls."
1,Useless,"I have a bottom-of-the-line Zircon stud sensor that works, but this model can't even find the studs that I have located via other means (magnetic).How did this product ever get released?"
1,Doesn't find studs,"I've had this for several years and it was to replace an older unit. Very unreliable finding studs both with false positives and not detecting the stud. One time I tested it against a wall without wiring, pipe, etc. and one side free of sheet rock (garage) where I could see the studs. It would not properly detect location of the studs and would show a stud when one wasn't there. The results weren't repeatable either. My older unit ran circles around this thing."
4,"zircon pro sl-ac, works fine for me",I only used it to find a stud on my wall and it worked perfectly. I have not tried to look for damaged wiring. Read the instructions before you try to put in the battery. I like this unit.
4,needs good battery then it works,Had a used but functional energizer battery in and didn't work at all. Put a new duracell in and it worked great. battery compartment cover is difficult touse though.
5,Springs gave my Trailblazer a great look and better handling,"Had these springs installed about 2 weeks ago and I must say, my Trailblazer looks so much better with the drop. Not too low, just enough to eat up some dead space between the body and tires in the wheel wells. The handling has also improved without making the ride too stiff. You will notice the bumps in the road more, but it isn't uncomfortable."
5,An excellent introduction to Eisler's songs,"This collection includes songs written by Hanns Eisler for plays by Brecht (Die Massnahme et al.), ""mass songs"" such as the United Front Song (Einheitsfrontlied), and selections from the Hollywood Liederbuch, with texts written by Brecht while he and Eisler were living in Southern California. In some cases, Eisler set Brecht poems which were also set by Kurt Weill; the comparison is enlightening. This is a fine introduction to the work of an important, complex, and (until recently) neglected 20th century composer."
