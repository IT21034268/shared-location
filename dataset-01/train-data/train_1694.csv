1,Apocalypse porn,"This book is horror / apocalypse porn, plain and simple. This book has you in for: cannibalism, bleakness, roasting babies over a spit (yes, really, YES, REALLY), starvation, people being kept alive in a basement so their limbs can be harvested for meat, recently raped pregnant women being marched along like cattle, and a man and his child struggling down the highway under constant ash / snowfall.If I wanted to watch a Saw: The Whole World is Terrible, I would have. I wanted to read something interesting. Despite the glowing reviews (Did you know that THE FIRE INSIDE US is actually JESUS?! NO ONE HAS EVER DONE THAT BEFORE!) this is horror porn. Is systematically destroys all possible hope for humanity, shows every possible horrifying thing, and then says BUT THIS IS A STORY OF HOPE. It's not. It's repulsive and, more importantly, has no point. Read this only if you like pointless horror."
5,Haunting and Moving,"This is one of the most important books of the 21st Century. It's McCormack's best among a slew of ""bests."" The relationship between son and father, along with the sacrifice of the mother which has ocurred before the novel's beginning, is incredibly moving and haunting. This book is a must read."
3,An average book,"I feel this book is grossly overrated. A very gray, bleek story that abruptly ends. Its worth a read, but not a 5 star book"
1,Terrible,"Thankfully, I only paid a quarter for this excuse for entertainment. If someone had not asked me if I'd read it, I would probably never have even picked the book up to read the blurb on the back. I forced myself to finish it to see if anything happened besides the same overwrought, depressing, mind-boggling going-nowhere non-sequence of events that this book contains."
1,save your money,"One of the most depressing books I've ever read.Also one of the most time consuming as I had to stop and look up a word in the dictionary about every third page.This work has no socially redeeming value to it at all except that the author wanted to prove he was smarter than the rest of us.Boring and stupid plot,The ""Father"" was an idiot, the son even worse.I find it hard to believe the two of them lived as long as they did after the disaster."
3,Arid in thoughts and in dialogs. Not really impressive.,"I expected more from this reading. It is full of boring dialogs that invariably end in ""okay"" and add nothing to the story. It is no match to either All the pretty horses or Child of God."
4,Wonderfully written but depressing story,This is the story of a young man and his son walking across the country after the planet has been destroyed by an undisclosed apocolypse. Very well written. As a father of 3 boys I felt upset through a lot of the story. I am sure I over identified with it.
2,Empty Road,"I'm just a reader who wants to enjoy a good book. This novel doesn't fit the bill. After reading endless repetitive comments between father and son who are in repetitive situations, I was bored to death. Couldn't connect. Didn't engage. Waited for it to be over....I actually ending up skimming it just to get through it. Depressing novel with an incredibly slight glimmer of hope."
1,Depressing,"So much focus on the dreary weather - over and over and over again. Everything is gray, everything is damp, its gray, its damp...It's not the easiest to read, especially during the conversational areas."
1,not what i expected,"I had high expectations but in the end I was disappointed. Without giving it away for those who do buy the book, I felt it centered around the fall of society with little hope for even those who prepare for coming days."
4,Stark and hopeless no rest for the weary.,"The road was a very quick read for me and left me in a bit of an emotional turmoil. While being a lit bit short on the the facts and the back story it was enough ,I guess.. You see its one of those books that leave you changed if only for a while, but its going to impact you. The father is rather driven to keep traveling on to the coast at what cost,his life ,the boys? His behaviour left me quite mad at times moving on from safe areas to the desparation of the road again. Also the time and the setting of the book dont really jive with now or the near future. you get the idea that the story is set in a post nuclear war 70's. No mention of computers or any number of things that grace our modern lives. All that being said I did read it, I DID FEEL FOR THE CHARECTERS but mainly I felt emotioanaly gut punched when I wasn't looking ."
5,Eerie,"EerieThis is a very weird book. It starts with the punctuation. But it sure doesn't end there. A dismal story about a man and a boy, his son, survivors in a post-catastrophe world, all soot and ashes and cold and cannibalism. A grim world where the few living envy the dead. A savage world such as the dinosaurs must have faced 60 million years ago. This isn't your Lucifer's Hammer, or Road Warrior or I Am Legend. Those are uplifting by comparison. From the New Mexico author of No Country for Old Men and All The Pretty Horses, this is eerie, depressing, because you know it's not all that far fetched. McCarthy's imagery will disturb your sleep. You will crunch through the book in record time, anxious to put the nightmare behind you. I give it five stars."
3,Is this a good book? Of course it is.,"Is this a good book?Of course it is.Is it a very good book?It's okay.What is the book about?The book is about a father and his son.What are the father and son doing in the book?The father and son are on a long road trip.Is the road trip real long?Of course it is.Is the road trip real interesting?It's okay.Is it one of Cormac McCarthy's better books?It's okay.Is it worth reading?Of course it is.On a 1 to 10 scale, how does it rank?It's okay.Of course it is.It's very, very okay.Of course it is.Etc., etc., etc.,etc.,................................."
1,It couldn't be worse,"My first and (most likely) last book by Cormac McCarthy. The plot is simple, uneventful, repetitive, depressing and the end utterly laughable. Sorry, I can't find anything positive to say about this book, which is a pretty extraordinary fact!"
2,Why I won't be reading this book,"Why am I going to take a pass on this book? Because I have an eight year old son. Maybe it is a failing of mine, but I can't read about kids in peril (real or fictional) without mentally transposing my own child into that peril. Having read ""No Country for Old Men"" I can pretty well imagine the depressing nature of this book and quite frankly, I don't need to walk down that road. People with children have to continuously try to keep themselves positive and hopeful for the future. I almost feel bad for this writer (despite his fame and fortune) for having such a bleak outlook on things. Unless he writes to exorcise himself of that outlook, in which case he should pay us for the therapy. Either way, trying to raise a family, got no time to spend in the wallow. I realize the shallowness of rating a book I have not read. But thanks for the warning from those who have read it."
2,Waste of my Friday,"I checked this book out at the local library on Thursday and read it yesterday. What a waste of my time. I've read better books in this genre that were written well, provocative, and just more interesting. This book is what I refer to as a beach read, and a depressing one at that.If all the noted awards and the inclusion of it as an Oprah book club get more people reading, great. But, I will not suggest this book to another.Many others have outlined the plot, so I won't do so. However, the sparse dialogue did nothing for me. At least with Hemingway, you can read between the lines and less is more. Not the case with this book.I actually would have preferred more of an explation about:1. what really happened2. what happened to the mom/wifeJust relieved that I checked this out from the library and didn't purchase it. Stick to some of the author's other books."
3,"Intensely depressing, unsatisfying","A few reviewers jump to conclusions by stating it was a nuclear war, or that it takes place in a certain region of the US. Untrue. The author specifically leaves it completely ambiguous and NEVER explains either issue. In fact, one can only surmise that it was NOT a nuclear war as the characters are never concerned with radiation. One flashback mentions streaks from the sky and low booming sounds in the distance. Based on this I guess it was either an asteroid hit or a super volcano. Both would rain huge chunks of debris down across the globe, causing all the fires and devastation explained in the book, and have no radiation issues.But, the big problem is that he never explains it!!!"
1,Wish I could unread this book,"I suppose I should know better than to pick up a book just because it says that it won a pulitzer. Who decides who wins that prize? What were they thinking? I began and finished reading ""The Road"" yesterday evening. So, first of all, it uses some large type font and doesn't have a lot of content. Even considering the lack of content, I felt that toward the end even the author was getting worn down by the bleak picture he was painting. One page in particular read something like, ""They woke up, they were hungry, the man coughed, they kept walking"". OK, so I'm paraphrasing in a simplistic way - but it's not far from the actual content. I do not understand what people see in this book that makes it receive such rave reviews."
1,Sick,"I read half of this novel and put it down. So disturbing, so sick. The author needs therapy and really shouldn't have taken it out on me. I'm stuck now with the images in my head that no one should have. I don't think I'll read anything marked ""Oprah"" again. If she really read this and STILL recommends it, I don't think I'll be watching her show anymore either. Someone that twisted shouldn't be giving life advice to anyone. By the way, I skipped to the last page. It doesn't improve, so if you've looking for hope or a happy ending, forget it."
1,The Road,This book was terrible. Depressing and not that well written. I have never done this before but I actually threw this book away rather than giving it to someone or the local library! If this book has and good points I missed them.
1,Painful,"I should write to Cormac Mccarthy and demand my money back. I bought this book based on the glowing reviews I read here. After finishing I was speechless. This book had the dialogue of two dogs barking. Seriously, how in the name of good fiction can anyone call this ""brilliant""? The story drags and drags and ends up nowhere. I could have started this book on page 200 and still have gotten as much of the story. I feel cheated and fooled to have spent time I will never have back on this seemingly endless novel. Please don't be fooled. Skip this one and save your self!!"
2,Hope Springs...Artificial,"I thought this book was frustratingly vague. It didn't seem so much a way to force the reader to use his/her imagination as it did more a limited effort on the part of the author to tell a complete, coherent story. The endless descriptions were torpid. Worst of all, most scenes ended in a total cop-out. So, whatever they desperately needed, they just seemed to find, like the cache of food when they were starving. Huh? I guess it was just easier to finish the book that way. And the ending? This wonderful family just happened to be right there when the kid needed them? With the exception of a couple of scenes (the people in the basement or the fate of the mother, for example), it just wasn't very good. If that was truly the real world, the kid would have ended up as a catamite or someone's dinner."
3,Beautifully wirtten with unconditional love for your child.,"Beautifully written, shows the man's unconditional love for his child in the face of horrible end of the world calamity. The end of the world as we know it. The only motivation that keeps the man going is his love and protective instinct for his child. But also very depressing to read. The whole tone of the writing leads towards calamity, one after another. If survival really so important in the face of such adversity? Maybe yes, maybe no."
5,Grim and Painful,"As others have mentioned this is a very grim novel. But what I found most remarkable, is the love the father and son had for each other and the hope, against all one could sense or imagine, the father had for his son. McCarthy created a hell on earth to illuminate in the starkest terms possible, the power and endurance of love and hope. To love someone is painful thing in this world or any other, but it's love and hope that animates the man and his son and preserves their humanity. Well done."
2,Good Writer...Unreadable Story,"The aftermath of some apocalyptic happening is detailed in excruciatingly horrific detail while a father and son journey to a better world. I cannot blame the writing on this books boring nature; Mr. Mccarthy can obviously write very well. But the storyline, which is not original, does not really provide an interesting read. You just sort of wallow in the disaster that the world has become and wonder what will become of the father and son. Unfortunately, there is no explanation of what happened, or why. There is little explaination of where the father and son are going...and a poor explaination of why they left where they were. So, there you have it, I hate to give the story away; but that's it. I assume that the rave reviews are more about the style of describing the imagery of a destroyed world and the hope of a father. Sorry, it didnt do it for me; Putting more of story around the imagery would have made this book worth reading."
2,Too slow for me...,"After reading the rave reviews this book received, I picked it up with high expectations. I was extremely let down. The repetitiveness of the story completely put me off. I kept waiting for something more to happen. I guess I was looking for a little more action in a book about post-apocalyptic earth. The prose was eloquent throughout, but at times McCarthy was long-winded in his delivery. The ending was apparent by the end of the first few chapters. My recommendation is to buy it used. Don't make the same mistake I did and pay full price."
1,The Road... to nowhere,"This book is hands down the worst book I've ever read in my entire life. Boring, poor writing style, choppy sentences, poor descriptions of time and place. Do not buy the hype on the book. There is no point to any of it. It is a page turner mostly because you keep turning the page hoping something actually happens. I can sum it up like this: Man and boy walk on road avoiding a handful of ""bad guys"" (any confrontations in this book are lame) while running out of food and water and then just when you think all hope is lost they find some food and water. Then, they start walking again to some unknown destination while running out of food and water. There isn't even a logical ending to this. Waste of time and money."
1,Not a masterpiece...not much of anything,"If you're reading this, you know the premise of the book and that many reviewers have given it high marks. I fell for the hype but I hope you won't. 'The Road' is like one of those abstract paintings that some people see as incredibly brilliant while the rest of us think it looks like a five-year-old got loose with mom's oil paints. Who doesn't get it - me or them? Who knows, but I'm pretty openminded in trying to appreciate good writing and my advice is not to waste your time or money on this book. If an unknown writer submitted work like this, publishing house editors would be laughing about it over lunch."
2,boring,why is this getting such good reviews is beyond me. nothing happens. i was expecting something but it fell short. they walk. theyre freezing. they go from one abandoned home to another looking for food and supplies. they push what they own in a shopping cart. thats the story. no action. disappointed.
1,Infuriating pricing by Amazon,"I'm cheating here, 'cause I didn't buy this. I was about to. But Amazon wants nearly 20% MORE for the Kindle edition than they do for the paperback. So, by (a) shelling out big bucks to Amazon for my Kindle, (b) saving Amazon their entire cost of a physical book, and (c) saving Amazon the cost of shipping it to me (I'm a Prime member, so they'd pay the shipping) I am expected to pay them 20% MORE. I am outraged. Send a message to Amazon: do not buy this book on Kindle until they price it appropriately."
1,Dark but hardly haunting......,This was probably the worst book I have ever read and although I did force myself to read the whole thing it would not be something I would reccoment to anyone. I will carefully screen any future Pulizer prize winning novels because my reading taste is obviously not suited to their standards. I gave it one star because it was printed and many people must like it so there you go.
2,Reviews here are more entertaining than the book,"If you're not one of the pretentious fools who gave this book 5 stars, give the 1 star reviews here a read. They are much more entertaining than the book itself. In particular, Russell T. Stodghill's review is a masterpiece of satire. All of the irritating aspects of The Road have been well covered by other reviewers, so I won't repeat them here.The one positive thing I will say is that the book kept me sufficiently interested to read it to the end in the hope that *something* would finally happen. But it never did. So I'm more annoyed having finished the book than I was while reading the book.Okay?Okay."
2,Overly dramatic use of descriptive words makes for a hard read,"I read this book some while back, prior to the release of the movie. I must say that I really wanted to like this author, but ultimately I cannot. Don't get me wrong, I do like the story. My issue is with an overuse of what I'll term ""over the top"" descriptive words which makes it hard to follow. I found myself having to read certain paragraphs over and over again before grasping what was being said. Sorry, not for me."
1,A character story with no character,"The premise sounded interesting but the book was horrible in my estimation. From beginning to end this book has no plot, no action and you never find out anything that happens. I guess that the lack of a plot makes this book a character piece. You are looking at the lives of a couple of people after the end of civilization. I found that I could not be less interested in the characters in this story though. They were flat, uninteresting, and really at the end of the book I really was just hoping they would die."
4,Simple yet effective tale of a father and son in a post apocalypic world.,A nameless father and son make their way across a desolate landscape trying to survive.Writer Cormac McCarthy doesn't waste words and his stripped down prose is a little disconcerting at first full of 1 word conversations yet for the tone and setting of this book it's perfect.All the father has left in the world is his son so he focuses solely on his comfort and survival and in that narrow focus The Road is a compelling tale of survival.This isn't a The Stand style epic but a riveting testament to the power of love when everything around you falls apart.
2,Not Impressed,"Maybe I'm a bit simple, but I thought this book could have been summed up in a couple of pages. Dad and boy on dreary road. Dad and boy looking for food. Dad wants to go look in a house for food. Boy doesnt. Boy finally agrees. Dad sometimes finds food, sometimes doesnt. Dad an boy continue on road. Creepy people all around. Some would like to eat the dad and boy. Others just want to steal their cart. Canned Fruit Cocktail never tasted so good.This could have been a fascinating story, I would love to find out exactly what happended? Was it a war? Was it a meteor? Someone forgot to put out their cigarette? Are there any ""normal"" places left in the world? Where have all the apostrophes gone?Yes, I'm a simpleton, but I wish there was more answers. I just kind of felt like the book just end..."
2,Only for those who've never read McCarthy's previous novels,"Not a fan of this book. I enjoyed Cormac's previous novels, including ""Blood Meridian"", ""All the Pretty Horses"" and ""The Crossing"", which is my favorite, but I was bored out of my mind with this novel. The unimaginative apocalyptic world or the dynamic between the father and the son weren't enough to sustain my interest. What kind of conversation did the father and son have? Example:Son: I'm cold.Father: I know.That's about it. It's just an exercise in metaphors, and a pretty obvious one at that. A real disappointment because it just pales in comparison with his other novels, which are so textured and layered, they're amazing. If you've never read any of McCarthy's previous novels, you might find it good."
2,Just not my cup of tea,"As an unpublished writer, I hesitate to criticize my peers who have been published, however, I must say that I was extremely disappointed with Mr. McCarthy's story. I thought the way he structured the novel was interesting in terms of there being no punctuation to distinguish dialouge (I took it as metaphor for the post-apocolyptic world he describes, formless in nature). Perhaps my most pressing issue with the novel is it's aloof and impersonal nature. I found myself being told that the two character in the novel loved eachother, rather than experiencing it through their interactions. I know this novel has received critical acclaim, so perhaps, like I said in the title of this review...it's just not my cup of tea."
5,Amazing,"Despite the stomach-turning content, the first word that comes to mind for this book is ""beautiful."" The book celebrates the survival of goodness despite complete hopelessness and despair. The atmosphere of the novel is utterly dark and at times disgusting, but the beauty of the relationship between the father and son and the other elements of goodness that continue to survive shines through the darkness. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who believes that the light shines in the darkness and that the human spirit can survive any catastrophe."
2,I really wanted to give it more stars,"The book is touching, in terms of the love between father and son and the termoil they endure; however I cannot seem to get past the fact that everyone was over the moon with the story and it fell flat for me. I actually felt as though something was wrong with me that I wanted more and it did not deliver. Perhaps it is not my kind of read."
2,"He's a brilliant writer, but...","I wish I loved this as everyone else seemed to. And line by line, it's pretty much impossible to deny that McCarthy is one of the greatest living writers. That said...how familiar was this conceit? How thin was its execution? How many descriptions of the grey, grey landscape do we need? We get it! Things are reallllllly bleak.He seems (to me, at least) to be ripping off his own themes from earlier works. That people are very, very bad is driven home for about 95% of the book. And then: surprise! A vaguely happy ending. Maybe there IS hope. Maybe SOME people aren't that terrible. But nah, most of them really are. I know, Cormac. I read your other stuff too. Get a new angle, would ya?"
5,Buy this book!,"From the first paragraph to the very last I had this overwhelming feeling of sadness envelop me throughout this entire book, and it's been a long time since a fictional book has been able to do that to me.I read the reviews before I purchased this book, and to be honest, I was kind of skeptical, because it's rare to find a really good book that so many people can agree on. I had a feeling this book may have been over-hyped but I wanted to see what the big deal was, and having since finished it I can honestly say: believe the hype, this book is amazing. An absolute read for anyone who demands emotional and character driven plot. Easy to pick up and read, and incredibly hard to put down.Buy this book!"
1,Is everyone kidding?,"I have read Blood Meridian and No Country For Old Men, and enjoyed them both. But The Road? I wondered about halfway through if someone had a played a joke on me. Like maybe McCarthy said, you know what, screw it. I've been writing books for years with very little recognition, so I'm going to throw out this piece of [...] and see if I can fool them. And he did. Nothing happens, but it happens over and over. It was snowing. It was dark. They built a fire. They ate a tin of peaches. It began to snow again. It reminds me of when Faulkner finally wrote a crappy novel and won a Pulitzer for it. The world never ceases to amaze me."
4,Either you hate it or you love it.,"Ok, it's a good book. It's moving, and it's a little disturbing. Yet the lack of punctuation is very distracting for the first 100 pages, then you get used to it. I liked it personally but it also left me feeling dirty, because of the cannibalism and the terrible things that people can do, like when they left that man naked in the cold to die."
5,Harrowing,This book is like a train wreck - an awful truth that is impossible to look away from. I hated it yet didn't want it to end. I also found the ending a bit unsatisfying. It is however an excellent read.
3,"A One Time Read, but Probably Overrated","While I found The Road interesting and at some level gripping, in the end I thought it was overrated. Sure, love and hope are a reason to live, and the stark struggles of life in a wasteland always have that attraction that is not unlike driving by a bad car wreck on the highway, hard to turn away from, but difficult to look at also. However, the writing is so sparse that I couldn't help but wonder if it was overly simplistic. Occasionally, especially in the last paragraph, I found myself wondering if McCarthy was being simplistic and obtuse just to be simplistic and obtuse, but without any real point (or willingness to reveal that he did not have a point).Read it once, and enjoy it, but it doesn't deserve the Pulitzer."
1,Mr. McCarthy needs some serious meds,"What a sad state of affairs when all someone as talented as this guy is with words can come up with is this bleakscape of a novel that goes nowhere, adds nothing to our understanding of what life is, and forces the reader to pitch this manic depressive tell all into the fireplace and go out and build a few new nuclear power plants. This is just more of the humans are the devil and the earth would be better off without us silliness. Cormac, please take some of your money that these poor folks who thnk this is 'deep stuff' spend on this self flagellation of yours and get some therapy. Human life is a really joyful thing and please try to lift folks up with your considerable talent with words. That would be a considerable contribution instead of this suicidal morass you seem to live in."
2,The World Is Depressing Enough....,"This is the most depressing book I have ever tried to read. I say it in this way because I did not have the stomach or motivation to finish this book. McCarthy's writing style is elegant and his passion for father and son stories is admirable. However, the story line for this book was just horrific and bleak. I felt like I was in a cold, gray fog the whole time I was reading it and I did not like the utter hopelessness I felt. After I realized I was not going to be able to finish the book, I skipped to the last few chapters and felt even more validated in deciding not to read the rest of it. Maybe it's because I do believe that God provided all of us with His plan of redemption and hope. This book exhibited none of that."
3,Left hangin',"This story is a quick read because you keep yearning for more complex encounters...page after page the same bleakness. You actually start imagining in black and white. After you finish you think,""did I just read an excerpt?""."
5,Beautiful.,"I am an avid reader and it has been a long time since a book has moved me the way ""The Road"" did. As soon as I finished I picked it up and read it again. It is a mesmerizing, tragically beautiful piece of work that I cannot recommend enough."
4,Fast but deep,"This book went as fast as a light summer read, but the subject was anything but. It was very dark or more accurately grey. McCarthy pulls you into his bleak futurescape and purposefully telegraphs his ending as much as any author that I've read. Yet the impact of what you know is coming isn't deadened at all. Don't let the Oprah seal fool you or dissuade from reading this book. This is not the first time she has picked an edgy and dark novel. Read on.(Note on my 4 stars: I almost gave it 5, but I am a huge reader and this didn't quite make it into my top 5 books.)"
4,Haunting,"I read this book nonstop - it's easy reading. However, I found it frightful, haunting, loving, and just plain weird in some places. I've passed it on to friends and told them ""it's not a happy book"" by any means but interesting read about a father and son in a hopeless world."
4,The road,Very intense book. This is the kind of book that sticks with you afterwards. I would definitely read again. I will be searching for more from this author.
4,Great Read,This was a great read for the other post-apocalyptic junkies out there. It can a little slow in the beginning but the author does hold your attention. The writing style can be drawn out with metaphors at times but overall an easy read.
5,Keep an open mind,Great book if you like personal struggle and internal conflictOkay?OkayOkayDon't compare the movie to the book
5,"Dark, Dreary & Hopeless","This book is the story of hopelessness. It is captivating and ironic, and macabre at their finest. You have not felt desperation until you've read this book. I was chilled to the bone the whole way though."
4,Brilliant writing no story,"McCarthy at his top. This is all about style. Two caracters, ""the boy"" and ""the man"" in a sort of ""huit clos"" in an unreal environnement. The story it itself looses all interest when it comes to feeleings, emotions and ethics. If you look for action don't buy this book. If you do buy it, take your time to read, think, re-read, re-think, you'll love it!!"
5,The Master,"Cormac McCarthy shows why he is one of the most consistently fine writers in America with this thought-provoking and entertaining tale of post-apocalyptic America. The characters have no names, little history and no real destination, yet their encounters in a bleak and dusty world are gripping.Altough McCarthy is probably best known for ""All the Pretty Horses,"" I recommend ""Suttree"" as his masterpiece."
1,"50 cent words, 10-cent quality","McCarthy is so clever. He adapts Hemmingway's spare writing, mucks it up with 50 cent words, then applies it to a book with no plot, no motivation, no character. Also, he uses a lot of British-style grammar, even though he is not a Brit. He divorced a Brit a while back but that's as close as he got.It works okay as a mood piece, and might have been a decent short story. The large print and line spacing suggests he was reaching to make it a novel.If you want a mood piece that actually moves you, try some Kazuo Ishiguru. Hit the road, Cormac."
2,Despair,A homage to the most depressing novel I've ever read:DespairWhatAll I see is despair papaPlease dont cryI cant help itTake half of my prunesIm not hungryYes you areIll save it for laterOkThank you papaYoure welcomeThe man watched the fire flicker its orange flames to the starless night. Soon the boy ate the prunes one each. He placed the empty tin gingerly on the tarp. After while he fell asleep.<repeated for 284 pages>
2,Hated this book!,"Slow, slow, slow and slow! Yes, it brings the point home, desolation, fear. Thank goodness it was a short story."
2,Overrated,Overall i felt that this book was given too much credit as a literary piece of work. I felt that the book lacked many things that MCarthy had placed in his previous novels. This book was 250 pages of nothing that could be summed up in about 10 pages if not less. Im sorry if i'm being heartless but i felt this book did not deserve the raves it was given.
2,The Road 2006,"Plot Kernel - It's the end of civilization and the people are nearly gone. A man and a boy walk south. They have a plastic tarp, a grocery store pushcart with a mirror attached to see behind them, and knapsacks on their backs. The man has a revolver. Along the way they speak in grammatically simple, short, childish sentences like characters in an old Dick and Jane learning-to-read book. There are no quotation marks. Do you see that? Yes, I see that. What is it? I don't know. Of course you don't. Are we going to die? Of course we are. Oh, I am afraid. The narrator drops his verbs. The wind cold. The hunger and thirst and cold. Everything ashes and dried and burnt. Memories of her. Fear inside them. The poetry of apocalypse around them. He breaks sentences in two. They sat down. Sipping water. Such poetry. Give the man acclaim. This is so wrenching. Award him a Pulitzer. I am about to weep."
2,The Road,"The Road is a tedious journey to nowhere. The characters are one-dimensional with no personality. I loved the premise thats why I attempted the book, however it was a huge disappointment. They journey to the coast because I don't know?, avoiding certain people because I dont know, cannibals? right? No background to the story and no future either. Just the road. So if you want to travel down the road with a no name man and boy, hope you like poor grammar and sentence structure as well as big holes in the story that will leave you annoyed or even pissed off that you attempted what should have been a good story of a father's love for his son. It left me cold."
3,Decent read.,There is so much hype about this book I was kind of disappointed. The first fourth of the book is extremely boring but it picks up eventually. I am anxious to see the movie as most of the book is very well written.
2,The Road that goes no where,"Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" is an extremely slow read. I found it to have long stretches of boring repetitiveness followed by a short burst of some excitement. The story is like a bad song with a repeating chorus and the only excitement comes in the bridges of the lyrics. ""The man and the boy walk, get hungry, get cold, build a fire, sleep, REPEAT x2, find some food, eat it, see some people, survive it, REPEAT chorus again."" It was certainly not one of my favorite books but I did enjoy the strong relationship between the man and boy. They only have each other and it makes for a touching father and son relationship. Other than that I found ""The Road"" a dismal and depressing story, set to an equally bleak and depressing back drop."
2,The road to nowhere indeed.,"This book was totally overrated. Everyone loves to praise how ""revolutionary"" the writing style is, but as far as post-apocalyptic stories go, this book goes nowhere.Yes, it is a ""heart wrenching"" tale of a father and son's love, and yes, the book is a metaphor for the challenges, disappointments, and journey of raising a child. But the author is so full of himself that the ""unique"" writing style completely overshadows any of these messages.It really just is sloppy and poor writing that everyone is digging because ""it's different and deep"". Screw this I want my money back."
5,Loved this book,"I loved the writing, characters, story, and style. This is a page turner. Will haunt you forever."
5,"A powerful, remarkable novel","This post-apocalyptic novel, written by an author we associate with his previous classic novels set in the American southwest, is a remarkable achievement. It is hard to imagine a father reading this book without being tremendously moved. The story of a father and his son, trying to survive in a world destroyed by human stupidity and evil, told by one of our greatest living writers. A great book."
2,Can I spoil it if it's already rotten?,"Honestly, I found this to be a very enjoyable read. I looked forward to getting back to it every evening. Yes, as some of the harshest critics have noted, at times the word choice just seemed absurd. But overall I found the prose to be superb. This is easily the best book with virtually no plot that I have ever read.And then the boy is saved at the end and there's some vague Judeo-Christian pseudo-spiritual/philosophical crap that is supposed to pass for seeds-of-hope and a book ending. I was surprised how much McCarthy ruined it in the last few pages. Seriously, I re-read the end three times just to be sure I hadn't missed something in my initial read/reaction.The ""good guys"" live to ride again, and the story is totally ruined."
3,Quiet,"I must admit that for once, I liked the movie better than the book. I think the movie captured more of the depth of the personalities and situations than did the book. So I say congratulations to the movie makers and actors. It is interesting.I listened to the OverDrive version borrowed from the library while reading it. Rupert Degas's voice was dull and quiet as the narration of a dulled world. His character voices were also quite appropriate.It's the kind of book to make you think, ""what if?"""
3,The too-long road to. . .nevermind,"Where have you gone, Maxwell Perkins?Perkins is the editor who helped trim Thomas Wolfe into shape. He would have made ""The Road"" into a great short story. But he's gone. . .and he didn't. . .and it isn't. Yet it is still good--at times tender, at times shocking--despite too much ash and too many pages."
4,a good read,"a good read its a whats round the next corner sort of book,not easy to put down,as a lot of good books a good story about very little."
2,Disappointed,"OK, I know the Pulitzer prize is political, but I thought an author who received one would be good. This book was just plain bad. It dragged along from start to finish unchanging. Just read the first part ten times and you have the story. Then it ends. Don't waste your life reading about two wasted lives."
3,Didn't captivate me like I thought it would..,"Upon reading the reviews for this book and the plot summary, I bought this book thinking that it would be one of those that I just fell into love with. I was horribly wrong. It was very difficult to read, not because of how it is written, but mostly because it was boring and there was really no climax in the book. I kept waiting, but in the end I was truly disappointed. I will say this.. McCarthy is very talented in his choice of words. If he were to write a collection of poetry, I would buy it and most definitely enjoy it. Otherwise, I will probably not read any more books by Mr. McCarthy simply for the fact that this story failed to grab my attention."
2,Probably not the right author for me,"This is the second work by Cormac McCarthy that I've read, and the resulting disappointment was the same. The first was Blood Meridian, which I was nearly unable to finish. The austerity of the writing and the bleakness of the stories fails to engage me. I suspect that I will never be able to enjoy a book in which none of the main characters has a first name. The Road was more palpable to me, but not by much. The ending was mildly hopeful, but certainly not inspiring. The struggle to survive in a post-nuclear world was described with some interesting details, but I never developed an emotional attachment to either the boy or his father."
3,Gray.,"This is perhaps one of the more realistic apocolyptic books I've read, but it left me with one word at the end, ""gray"". The world, the characters, the sky, the water, the trees, the soil...it's all gray. Well-written, but this will definitely set the reader into a sober, somber frame of mind."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This is perhaps the worst book I've ever read. There is no plot, no characters, nothing redeeming about it. It's 300 pages of walking and making fires. If I want to see walking and making fires I'll just watch Lord of the Rings."
1,Sadly disappointed!,"Sorry to say I was disappointed. Another reviewer described it best...minimalism. There was no meat to the story (no pun intended). It wasn't original, epic nor educational. I found myself skipping distracting poetic jibber jabber. It may make for an interesting movie but for a book it was plain boring. If your looking for a good post apocalyptic read I'd recommend ""Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse""."
2,just didn't pull me in,"I've read many of the mostly glowing reviews about this book, but THE ROAD just didn't pull me in. A boy and his father are traveling to who knows where on a planet that has been struck by some unspecified catastrophic event. Almost everyone in the story has devolved into savage-like behavior, including the father, although the boy somehow retains his humanity. This book is one depressing lessen in how little we can expect from our human brethren in seriously dire times (though the ending does offer a bit of hope).At first I found McCarthy's 'cut to the bare bones' writing style unique; but after a while, the lack of punctuation became tiring. The author was probably trying to make a point here about the fluff of existence being unnecessary in the midst of genuine catastrophe. Ultimately, instead of finding McCarthy's writing profound, I felt the author was just a bit too full of himself."
5,An American Quest,"Cormac McCarthy continues to astound me with his virtuoso performance writing ""The Road"". While I have been a rabid fan of his for years, I was slightly disappointed in ""No Country for Old Men"". This story however, is so bibical in nature and it appears to me that Christian symbolism resides everywhere in the narrative. However, it still is a base post apocalyptic survival story and very readable without exploring the Christian context. As always I will look forward to reading Mr. McCarthy's next book."
2,Falls short,"Just finished The Road. Knew that it was featured in Oprah's Book Club, but decided to read it anyway. Have mixed feelings. I wasn't wowed by this book. I didn't know what to expect - but it seems like this would have been better as a short story rather than a novel. The characters don't really develop in a way that compliments the rich descriptions of the world they inhabit. It is a powerful book, but it was missing a ""heart"". Even the innocent boy is one dimensional. It seems to me that if one is going to write a book in which a post-apocolyptic cannibal-infested hell on earth is merely a backdrop- there needs to be more depth to the characters.It is really just a vivid description of completely random events - the story doesn't build at all. Maybe it isn't supposed to. Seems like wasted potential."
1,Get It Out Of My Head,"Some books don't teach you anything but the arcane depths of despair that human beings can reach. Very much like 'Life in the Time of Cholera', this book was a tour through a macabre mind, a desolate wilderness of the desperate soul.If by some feat of technology or magic, one could take a guided tour through the hell of another's life, any sane person would ask - of all human experience why go here?McCarthy scores for those who are such tourists of despair. But even on technical merit, there is no redemption for this exercise in spiritual torture. Get it out of my head - it's like the mind chewing grubs from the Wrath of Khan."
5,Genius Read,"This was -hands down- the best book I have read all year. Cormac McCarthy is genius. From the very first page, I was riveted and could not put this book down. McCarthy is an amazing writer and -in a word- this book was ""unforgettable"". I can't stop talking about it!"
5,Loved it,"I'm not much of a ""reviewer"" but I couldn't put this book down. It was a very quick read and I highly recommend it!"
4,If the world were to end...,"This book was so dark and gloomy. I kept expecting something horrible to happen around the next corner. I had bad dreams for two nights in a row thanks to it, yet the relationship between the father and son was most inspiring. The only bright thing in the whole book was their love for one another."
5,One of the Most Moving Books I've Ever Read,"This is unquestionably one of the most moving books I have ever read. Set in a post-apocalyptic America, this book is neither about the apocalypse (never described) nor its aftermath but rather about the relationship between a young boy and his father as they travel ""the road"" together. The relationship between the young boy and his father is described in such a way that their love for each other and the boy's trust in his father are almost palpable to the reader. The dialogue is sparse but moving and powerful. I doubt if in the history of English language literature the simple word ""Okay"" has ever taken on such profound significance. Cormac McCarthy deserves the Pulitzer he received for this novel. If you love books, do yourself a favor and read The Road. I'm sure I will revisit this book many times in the future."
5,Be prepared,"Don't sit down with this book and expect to be joyfully entertained. But, do expect to be treated to visual images, heart-wrenching love and devotion amidst chaos and despair. Mr. McCarthy's style of writing in this story is fascinating - he doesn't even use apostrophes - don't for example is missing the needed mark to denote the word - one wonders why but it successfully creates the complete sensation of so much that is missing - color, light, warmth, life.Enter this ashen world and be transfixed - you won't come away the same person.Perhaps you will rub the top of your child's head and appreciate all that's around you."
2,What did I miss?,"I know it won the Pulitzer and much critical acclaim but I think it is terrible. I bought this before it won the Pulitzer based simply on my regard for McCarthy's earlier work. I think his Blood Meridian and Border Trilogy are great works but I cannot say the same for ""The Road"". I read it twice (thank goodness it is a shorter work) and failed to find any redeeming qualities.In my opinion, ""The Road"" failed on many levels: the thematic content was as barren as the landscape the novel depicts, McCarthy's attempt at minimalism was sophomoric, and fictional continuity was appallingly lacking(all animals are dead except man?) Of course, any novel depicting apocalypse will evoke some human emotion just as visiting a slaughterhouse will evoke much emotion - but neither can be rightfully called art simply because they evoke strong emotions. I expect art to also entertain, enlighten, and provoke deeper thought; I did not experience any of these with ""The Road""."
3,Could have been better,"I think this book was good, but the ending was a bit much for me as I had recently seen a movie that had a VERY similar ending, so much so, that mid way through this book I joked with myself saying what if the book ended the same way this movie did, and sure enough, it did.The book is very dark and depressing, and the fight for survival is an intriguing plot line, but with the end of the book being something I guessed correctly, it kind of took away from the magic that I think it gave other readers."
2,Not credible,"This book has had so many reviews, so mine will be brief. What kind of natural disaster leaves large mammals as the only survivors? Was it nuclear war? Volcanic eruption? Strike from a random meteor? Fellas, it's the big things that die--the little ones find hidey holes and later evolve to become the next big thing. There's nothing to eat but each other because there is no one left except humans and... dogs? The plants are all dead, and other animals appear to have been evaporated by the same ray beam that zapped most of these reviewers' powers of reasoning. A little more imagination would be welcome & next time give the kid a few more lines than: Papa I'm scared. A kid that age would have quite a bit more to say than that."
2,"If You Are Depressed, Don't Read This Book","This book is bleak and depressing. I am not a depressed person, but I felt like jumping off a cliff after reading this book. My husband even hated this book and he has read every post-apocalyptic book there is. There is no hope, no love, and no good character interaction. Just doom and despair. So if you want to feel bad afterwards, by all means read this book. Why Oprah picked this book, I have no idea."
5,"we're the good guys, right?","I think ""The Road"" is a masterpiece! My new ""best book ever read"". I'm sure I'll return to this amazon forum for years to come to read readers reaction to this great work of fiction. For me, it turned out to be an eerie tale of good and evil. One day I'll try to understand better why I started weeping during the last paragraph. I'll just say that the the boy (the son) will always be a storybook hero of mine. Suspenseful, unique, riveting, 6 stars!"
5,"Stark, Beautiful, Terrifying, Hopeful...Brilliant","I've just finished reading Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel The Road. I found the experience to be profound. Out of the ashes of this sad, sad tale of post-apocalyptic America rises a hymn to survival, to the love between a father and a son, to the gift of a strong human spirit, and to the notion that good does trump evil, even when evil is all around and the lines between good and evil get murky. I admire McCarthy's bravery in furthering his stark, sparsely written tale by eschewing common punctuation, superfluous adjectives, and even in denying the father and the son names. McCarthy hasn't just written beautifully, he's crafted a novel as only a master can. You don't often read brilliance. The Road is filled with it."
1,Did the cannibals eat the punctuation too?,"Crossing a burned America, a father and son fight to survive. There is no food, no plants, no animals, and worst of all...no punctuation.I wanted to like this book. It could have been so good! Confusing, slow, and crazy use of adjectives, this book completely failed to draw me in. The only reason I kept turning the pages was in hopes of something more exciting that a canned peaches and the occasional cannibal sighting. What the hell Cormac McCarthy? It could have been great!"
1,Waste of time,The book had its moments but for the most part was slow and boring. I trudged through it hoping for a good ending that wold stir my emotions and intelect and was disapointed.
1,"concept interesting, but plot fizzles","When you got to a few interesting spots, they quickly fizzled. No background information at all into what had happened... perhaps the author thought that would detract from the story? bad boring dialogue and anticlimatic. I mean, where were they going? down a freaking road with a shopping cart? not even plausible and actually downright ridiculous"
1,Highly predictable with little meat on the bone...,"Although the book is a quick read, I wish I could have the time I spent reading it back... Highly predictable, without any real surprise or insight, and of course numbingly depressing.It went into the trash when I was done, a *very* rare event."
1,NHot impressed with authors ability,"As an avid reader of 2-3 books per week I sometimes have difficulty finding new books that would interest me. One of my perennial favorites are books on the future, and that is why I chose to purchase this book.To say I was disappointed would be a great understatement. This is not creative in the writing sense at all. Nothing is easier then to produce a piece that is 100% one thing or another with no nuance, no thought of entering even a clue into the writing of where the author is coming from. All is settled from page one. The worlds is a sewer and it ain't getting any better.This book could have been written as a short story of 15 pages instead of a 250 pp novel that just keeps getting more and more gloomy."
2,Redundant and boring,"A man and his child walk and find some food. They walk some more and find more food.I basically just described the whole book.One of the most boring and redundant books I've ever read. There is probably 10 pages of interaction between the main characters and other people. Every time you think something is getting ready to happen the book disappoints you. I have no idea why this book was so highly recommended.It only received two starts because of how well it was written. Other than that, there is nothing to this book besides two people walking around for 280 pages."
1,"Oprah Book Club, I should have known better...","Am i the last sane man on the planet? the absolute poorest work i have ever attempted to read. I knew it was on the oprah book list but, purchased it anyway. I should have gone with my gut and stayed away."
2,Too grim and depressing for me.,"If you feel that in the end the human spirit distills down to primordial need to keep ourselves and our children alive at all costs, then you will find the ""The Road"" redeeming and reaffirming to your world view. The story of the man and the boy on the ""The Road"" was well told, but too grim and depressing for me."
5,A haunting tale...a barren landscape...beautifully written,"McCarthy's book won't take you long to read since it is a very ""sparsely"" written book. Many pages take only a minute or so to read, but there is a method to the madness. The post apocalyptic world finds a father and son (both are nameless) trying to find their way to the coast in hopes for some better existence. The dialogue between the father and soon is moving and the story is terrifying at times with a world that has fallen into anarchy.The brilliance of the book is the ability of McCarthy to barely fill a page of text, but have you scared, worried, fearful or dreading what will happen to these two people. Each page takes you on their journey knowing that there is no real hope for either of them in a world gone mad.I cannot recommend this book enough."
5,The Art of the Sublime,"The Road delivers a double punch to the reader's solar plexus:First, there is the horror of its nuclear winter - a world emptied of everything but burnt stumps and ashes, traversed by son & father on a road likewise emptied of any real destination. It is terrifying.Second, there is its language - without herald a bleak description becomes a soaring, gorgeous metaphor (a swimming trout, for example, becomes all the brooding history of the world). A flat, brief exchange of dialog suddenly carries all the emotional intensity of impending suicide. All this comes without warning, and it comes on every page.For the reader it is eventually as frightening and breath-taking to broach the next sentence as it is to travel the next mile of The Road.This is a horrible world, brilliantly written. The Road has nothing to do with science fiction and everything to do with the high art of the terrible and the sublime."
2,i would like a happy ending,"I read it in two days and I couldn't put it down, however i was hoping for the blue sea and white sand with survivors on it , not black ashes and the man dying coughing his blood up. The style of the book was hard for me to read. I'm not too amazed by this book"
1,"Bleak, boring, no plot to speak of!","Father and son wander aimlessly, almost get eaten by cannibals, father dies, child gets ""adopted"" by a new nuclear family that is also wandering aimlessly on the road. The end. There is no identifiable conflict or climax, no redemptive message about love, deliverance or anything else. The characters are uni-dimensional and really have nothing to say. What IS the lesson or message you're supposed to glean from this novel? Answer: There isn't one, so don't bother searching for one."
1,just awful,"Like some of the other reviewers who do not want to be swayed by public opinion (I particularly liked the ""emperor's new clothes"" analogy)--this book has got to be one of the worst things I have ever read. The prose is bad, the characters are uninteresting, and the story repeats itself over and over with no resolution at the end. The only reason I didn't throw it out the car window was that I was sure it had to get better. It didn't. Depressing start to finish. Sometimes you just wish you could get your money and your time back. Find something worthwhile to read--this book is not it."
1,A Boring Read,"Hated this book from the first incomplete sentence I read. It's so full of grammatical errors, for effect obviously, that I was unable to visualize his very colorful use of adjectives. Would NOT recommend this book to the casual reader like myself, only ""readers"" can appreciate the ""off the wall"" phraseolgy he uses."
1,What?????,"I am an avid reader of ALL genres of books. This book left me shaking my head.......from side to side, thinking to myself, okaaaay. I've read a few books in the past that left me doing the same thing.I guess one will read into a work of fiction what they want to, just like music. It affects all of us differently. This left me thinking...... what other book could I have spent my money on?"
3,Could have done more...,"The story had so much potential!! First off, I don't like McCarthys style off writing. He try's to be so poetic, for which he does a good job but to me it just seems like too much fluff. Second the book is predictable as the dreary nature of the book foreshadows the ending... I don't know... it was a good book but I guess I just expected more of an adventure / suspense. To use an example from the movies; I was expecting ""Independence Day"" but I got ""Signs""...."
4,A brilliant and gutsy piece of work.,"THE ROAD is a difficult book to review. It is definitely not for the squeamish. The story is brutal and horrific and exposes the baser emotions of man, while addressing the more noble and tender virtues of fatherhood. That in itself, would be a challenge for any writer, and McCarthy is certainly up to the task.The book is written to make you think, not to just take you for a joyride, and it does that very well. This book is not light-hearted entertainment, it is an experience that will never be forgotten."
4,The Road by Cormac McCarthy,It was so sad but the author did a great job of tying it all in. I would recommend it.
1,read this book - and get depressed,"I really disliked this book intensely. The author did a good job of developing the characters, but I had to stop reading it - I felt like I was falling down a deep, dark, hole. It is one of the most depressing books I've ever started reading.I would never recommend it to anyone."
4,Art Imitates Life,"The Road is one of those rare books that stays with you, and every once in a while pops into your head at certain moments of your daily life. It goes way beyond its foundation of basic survival in an apocalyptic environment.To add to all the observations, what I got out of it was that this is probably a personal reflection on McCarthy's part, whether he intended it to be or not. McCarthy has a young son, and given his advanced age, probably feels himself that he is on a compressed time frame to instill as much knowledge and wisdom as possible into his son before his time is up. This is exactly what is going on in the book. Brilliant."
3,Hoping for a little more....,"** spoiler alert ** I really really wanted to like this book, but i found that i was dissapointed. After reading ""No Country for Old Men"", i had high expectations and i felt let down. I needed time after reading this to really think about how i wanted to rate it and what i wanted to say in the review. I honestly felt like it missed out on a lot of key elements for me, particurally the beginning and the ending i felt were really weak. What led to this whole postapocalyptic world and what caused humans to be dangerous and eat other human beings. Also the ending didn't satisfy what happened to the boy, his father passed away, but what the heck happened to him?? did he make it or didn't he? I just really thought this book would be more then it was, and left me dissapointed."
3,"McCarthy's ""Road"" is dark and lonely...","This book did not measure up to ""All the Pretty Horses"" though the author has not lost his touch where description is concerned. I felt hungry and cold every time I picked this book up. ""The Road"" was a depressing story of a father's futile love for his only son. The tale wanders through one frightening scrape after another with unfailing courage and when there is a glimmer of hope--it becomes the only reason one would continue to read."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I read this book in 2 days, I really couldn't put it down. This book kind of opens your eyes to what may be happening to the world we live in in the near future."
3,The Road by Cormac McCarthy,"A science fiction book by Cormac McCarthy, better known for books of the West (No Country for Old Men), The Road is a sparsely written story of a post-apocalyptic world of what may be nuclear winter. A man and his son are trying to find home and food in a dead land. Not given to a happy ending."
1,"One of the most depressing books I've read in a long, long time...","I've read quite a few of the reviews here and obivously, I just don't get it. This book just left you feeling depressed. There is no real ""uplifting"" point in all 287 pages. I kept waiting (and hoping) it would get better, but it never did. The setting is bleak, hopeless and barren. The writing style left you with no real feelings for either of the characters. By the time it ended, you were wishing there would be another nuclear attack just to put them out of their misery. I would not recommend this book to anyone, but especially not to someone reading this author for the first time (like I was)."
1,Absolutely Terrible!!,"Don't buy off on the good reviews for this book. I wish I could get my money back. One of the most boring stories you will ever read. The main character responds to his kids concerns with, ""I know"" This occurs about fifty times in the book. I was ready to throw it in the trash if I read one more ""I know"" response. So the planet is destroyed and all the guy can say to his kid is I know?? Kid says, ""I'm scared"" dad says, ""I know"" Kid says ""I'm hungry"" dad says, ""I know"". What the hell? In addition, one moment they are deep in the woods, the next they are in a residental neighborhood, or pilfering through a supermarket. Then back to the woods.This goes on and on and on. Trust me, don't get hypnotized by the Oprah sticker on the front. But another book!"
5,You either get him or you don't......,"That McCarthy is no easy read is obvious. This is not for the shallow minded people of today's generation who think they are hip. This is utterly devestating, and the best book of the year that qualifies as modern day literature. I finished it a week ago and cannot stop thinking about it. It paints such a powerful image of love, hope, and survival in the face of extinction. It's not quite on the level of Blood Meridian or the Crossing, but it's vintage McCarthy. For those who don't want to question themselves, their own morality, and are looking for cheap apocalyptic entertainment....go watch The Postman."
1,Hot-flash of vocabulary in ashen night means what asks the man? Nothing papa.,"I just don't get it.What's that?Don't get it. This book, that is. All they do is push a cart and look for shoes.But it's the one they all love. Isn't it Papa?Yes, because they are hungry for anything that sounds interesting.But this?Yes, this. Choppy sentences, over-hot language, no plot, no character. An isocline of nothing. No sense of place or meaning. No hope.Why do they love it Papa?Because empty barrels make the noise.The man looked at his copy of The Road and thought, this all there is? And thought the book might be best as kindling for a fire. A fire to warm them against the unexplained ash.The best that can be said is that such writing punctuated with hot flash of vocabulary like from a thesaurus glassed by a youngster can be read so fast that it don't matter what hours you use on it for they are not many hours and can be got back without much fuss thought the man."
2,Too dreary and boring to finish,I started to read The Road but only got to about page 20. It is just too dreary and boring. A boy and his father traveling in a wasteland. In the end the father dies. What's to like? I give it two stars because it is not just crap. But it is a real downer of a book.
1,Tedious,"I purchased this for my book club's choice this month. Am I sorry I wasted the time and the money (especially since I feel it was over priced to begin with- being an ebook). The lack of dialouge quotes and the going nowhere plot was really irritating. I also felt I was reading the same thing over and over the entire book. Perhaps this would have been better executed as a short story to avoid so much repetition. I would never recommend this work to anyone and will, in fact, tell everyone to steer very clear."
5,The Road is a Unique Journey,"I'm really surprised by how much The Road affected me. It's so unlike most anything I've ever read. Who would have thought that a post-apocalyptic father-and-son journey would be so moving and haunting.And it's not just the mysterious journey, the plot, that moves the book along. McCarthy's prose is itself beautifully unique--sprawling and jagged at the same time. The Road is a book I'd recommend to anyone who appreciates literary fiction or questions how love can be sustained in the worst of conditions."
2,The Road is a flop,"I could not find in The Road what I expected after following the advice of so many helpful, favorable customer reviews. It has a bleak storyline devoid of a plot, with tedious, repetitive contents and actions, no character development and meaningless dialogues without truly pieces of wisdom to reflect on. However halfway the book I could not anticipate the ending, it has one indeed, so in a way, thrilled, I skimmed the pages to get to it and find out what it was all about. After I brought myself finishing reading this book I was relieved I could get rid of it"
2,Not as good as I though it would be,"An unnamed disater has stucked a man and his son are stuggling to lived in a new lawless world as they head down the road, towards the shore. All the way the man and his son hunting for food, avoiding people. The Road is the Pulitzer winning book by Cormac McCarthy and while other seemed to enjoyed I really didn't. I found Mr. McCarthy style of writing a bit unnerving and there seem to be little delevopment of the character's. It seem that this book could have been written in a weekend. I had been looking forward to the DVD but after reading the book, I am not sure if I going to waste my money on the DVD."
2,An Abridged McCarthy for Dummies,"Unless you suffer from attention deficit disorder, Oprah or the tender ministrations of the Uhhmerican education system, skip this puffball and go straight to McCarthy's real body of work, which ended abruptly upon completion of ""Blood Meridian."" In my opinion, ""Suttree"" is McCarthy's crowning achievement, and one of the great American novels of the 20th century, while ""The Road"" amounts to little more than a $ellout $creenplay and a tragic waste of the author's monumental talent."
3,Why this book?,I have always have been a Cormac McCarthy fan. I cannot understand why they this book received the Pulitzer prize when so many others he has written merit it so much more.
1,the road...the road,"Im in with the rest who found this book redundant. When they werent writing about the road he used the word macadam. Had to look up the word and almost threw up when I found out it meant pavement. I kept reading thinking certainly it must get better, how could it be on the best sellers list if it didnt have some substance? Boy was I wrong. Also, kind of hard to write this review without using the apostrophizes, even my spell check had a hard time, yet the writer didnt!"
3,Book is good!,I want to say that I loved the book it's a great story about the love a father has for his son.But that being said am I the only one that got tired of hearing the author refer to the kid as the boy.And the father as the man.I mean really do any of these people have first names?
1,Very disappointing,"I have to put myself in the ""hate it"" camp for this book. I read more than half of it, always hoping that it would develop, or the characters would develop or that SOMETHING would happen. I finally gave up when I read so many reviews that said nothing ever really happens even at the end. It was a relief to escape the unrelenting misery of the characters, as well my unrelenting misery reading it. For the people who find the spare prose and obscure language poetic or majestic or some such--I can only shake my head in disbelief."
1,Just because it's realistic doesn't mean it's a good story,"This is a boring, uninteresting story.There's no point to the story. No moral. No ultimate redemption. No twist ending. No payoff to the entire depressing tale.Perhaps it's great art.But that doesn't make it a good story."
2,I think I missed something here,Not sure why this book got so much attention from Oprah. I thought it was boring. I read the first 50 pages then put it down to read something else. I went back to it and found it a page turner but not sure why. I realized I would read pages but my mind was elsewhere so I wasn't sure what I had read.I'm not sure if it was because there was no real explanation of what happened. The characters were nameless. The relationship between the father and son didn't grab me. I just don't know why I couldn't get into it.I wouldn't suggest reading it.
1,Dull,"I can't believe I fell for the hype and bought ""The Road"". It is one of the most boring books I have ever read. A lot of walking, watching, waiting. ""The Road"" is a good book if you are having trouble going to sleep."
5,"Not usually a fan of McCarthy, but The Road is brilliant and a significant departure","In terms of its seeming simplicity, from other novels he has written. Dark, terrifying and powerful, this is one of the finest American novels in years. Its structure and muscular prose are so stark and well-crafted, this story picks you up, shakes you and won't let go even after you've read the final page. Also, if you missed Tino Georgiou's masterful novel--The Fates, go and read it.It is the first novel of the century that could rightly be called a masterpiece"
5,Brilliant,"All the favorable reviews here below say it all, so I'll just comment on the language McCarthy uses. The author's apparent flouting of the normal rules of grammar in favor of stark, harrowing rhythm works beautifully. Also, he uses all those wonderfully precise words we somehow almost forgot - skifts and catamites, gimbals and gambrels, stoven faces and balefires .... A bleak, beautiful read."
1,Depressing,"Couldn't finish it - terribly depressing. May have been the intention, but I just couldn't bring myself to turn another page..."
3,Just because Oprah recommended it doesnt mean it was great........,"This was pretty good, the main thing I did not like about it was the diaglog. There are better end of the world stories out there, The Stand, Swan Song, Earth Abides, Alas Babylon, Lucifers Hammer.I enjoyed this story far more than the diaglog.Would I recommend this? Yes, would I rave about it, no.Some of the things the characters went through were horrific and scary. I was glad the ending was uplifting."
2,Very disappointing,"I read this quickly to beat the movie, which was also praised by critics. Now I'm not sure I want to see the movie. Will it be a dull and incoherent as the book ? The Pulitzer committee must be desperate and clueless, or both. This certainly undermines my faith in critics. (also ""No Country for Old Men"" ) was only fair and it won best picture !!!! Maybe it's me ."
2,"Overrated, but interesting.","This book has been described as one of the best books of 2006 and I disagree. Though it's an interesting premise, I got bored with it. The characters are underdeveloped, there is not enough introspection, and though it does a good job of detailing the life at this kind of survival of the fittest stage, I got tired of the ""The man sat. The boy watched the man sit."" etc."
1,Buy McCarthy a new keyboard,"Other 1 star reviews state the weaknesses of this book better than I can.As a grammar nazi, this author needs a new keyboard. Contractions get apostrophes. You try to say one without the apostrophe...bet you can't. Secondly, if you want to write without using apostrophes, be consistent with it.It is also a nice thing to use quotation marks to denote conversation. But, as his keyboard was glitchy when he wrote this, I get why he never used any.Also prepare to be bored out of your melon with this book. And sickened to death of the word ""Okay."""
2,"OK book, not Pulitzer Prize level","I have read any number of apocalypse books and this is just one more. It pales in comparison to the best of the genre. Perhaps critics liked its absence of explanation of the apocalypse, the absence of explanation for virtually all life being apparently eradicated . . . but its lack of background information made it nothing more than a narrative with little of educational value or interest and, it seemed to me, a shallow work with little to commend itself."
5,A Morbid and Disturbing Trip,"This father's road trip with his son is more morbid and disturbing than any other apocalyptic fiction that I've read. Yet, I couldn't put it down. It's a stunning story about parental love and sacrifice that overrides the overwhelming violence, and a destroyed environment that the protagonists did not create and cannot control. The story pushes further the theme of hope, which is embodied in the small, brave man-child. That the man and boy are never named served to make the story more intimate, more personal to this reader. In the telling, McCarthy is repetitive, but never boring. Best of all, he knew when and how to end the story. The book doesn't bear a second reading to uncover its beauty. You will either love it or hate it with the first reading."
4,The Road to No Hope,"I read the paperback version of this book before I listened to it on CD, and I didn't notice until I listened to it how monotone was the post-apocalyptic world as McCarthy describes it. I guess I read the words in a paper---real?---book so quickly that I don't stop very often to paint pictures with them in my mind, but listening to the CDs, I was constantly reminded how colorless---and therefore hopeless?---the new world had become. I was hard put to describe what I thought about the printed book because it's very different from most of the books I've ever read, but I enjoyed very much listening to the audiobook being read to me. Cormac McCarthy is definitely going on my list of all-time Favorite Authors."
3,The Road,"The content and storyline of this book was alright. However, it seemed to be written by a 10 year old. Some parts of the book were heavily researched and well detailed while others seemed to be very thin. Consistency, one way or another would have good."
1,Nightmare,"Strong imagery, depressing, one long pointless video game. And please, spare me the Eastern slant. Funny though, the author's talent is heavy enough to penetrate and light enough to soar. The one star rating signifies nothing, like the book."
1,Cormac McCarthy: low class thief,I liked The Road a lot better when it was a film by Michael Haneke called Time of the Wolf.
1,"If You Must Try This, Borrow It!","I made it exactly nineteen pages into The Road before kicking it to the curb. Mr. McCarthy's way with imagery and description are such that I am inspired as an author to better my own craft, but well-written vignettes do not a gripping tale make. I am therefore left wondering how this book made it to the NYT best-seller list and many other books I've read this year haven't come close.Let me conclude this review with a public service announcement: Libraries Are Your Friend. Had I been reduced to finding this book at the store, I would have flipped through it and set it quickly aside or else bought it on impulse and been rather angry after the fact. Instead, I was able to borrow it from the local library and sample it. No harm, no foul."
4,Fast and Affordable Service,The shipment was delivered quickly and the price was great. I had no problems.
4,Easy read that touches your heart.,"I have to say I didn't start out enjoying the book. Once they hooked me, I couldn't stop reading. I didn't want the book to end. Their journey was incredible, lonely, tough, scarey, but most of all the human capacity to survive under any conditions. It left me feeling grateful for what I have, materially and emotionally. I called my kids later on and reminded them how much I love them."
4,AMAZING,"Bleak, dark, depressing, surreal, riveting, hard to put down. That basically sums up my feelings for The Road, McCarthey's best book yet.This book is incredibly compelling. Whether you love or loathe McCarthy you must read this book. Also it reminded me a bit of Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle, another highly recommended book.Cat's Cradle"
4,"Bleak but engrossing (also known as the 2,183rd review)","Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" is literally a book about not much (as some reviewers note) and a book about love, fear, despair, hope and sacrifice - which is everything a great book should be about.Set in a post-apocalyptic world of death and destruction that makes Mel Gibson's iconicThe Road Warriorlook like a hopeful romp along Sesame Street, ""The Road"" is bleak and spare, but I was driven to keep reading because I wanted to know two things: what caused the world to end and what happens to this boy and his father. I plowed through it in near record time and only one of my questions was answered."
5,Mind Bending,"Is this a 'summer beach book'? Decidely not. Does it make you see our society in a new way? Resoundingly yes. Did it make me think? Yes. Did it make me feel? Absolutely. Would I recommend it? Only to those who are not extremely depressed already by our common culture.My experience was reading the book, from cover to cover, one lovely summer afternoon outdoors. When I returned to my house, I had to check every door, window, closet, room and other possible hiding places. It was one of the most unsettling books I have ever read. Sadly, it does not read like fiction and I find it impossible to ignore."
2,"Boring, detailed, well written, wordy...","I don't want to bash this book; but talk about over hyped. Spoiler Alert: NOTHING HAPPENS. We're walking, now we're talking; OK let's walk and talk some more. Look out one chase scene, more walking and talking. No wonder the movie was only out for one day.The book is a great literary work, but the story is blah."
1,The Road,"I found this book to be far too long, boring, depressing and quite simply GRAY! I would not recommend it."
2,Bleak,"I think he is a great writer, but this story was so dark it made me wish it was over after 20 pages."
4,Skeptical but pleased,I didn't know exactly what to make of this book but I couldn't put it down. It was depressing and simple but somehow profound at the same time. I never would have picked it up based on its description but Oprah came through again.
2,---> A Bitter Disappointment,"I did not have sky high hopes for this book. I've been through that and knew better. My hopes were moderate. Even so, they were dashed. I realize that the minimalist approach the author took was meant to create a haunting atmosphere and it did work, but there was SO MUCH MORE he could have done with the 'story'. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Heck, I kept waiting for ANYTHING to happen. Unfortunately, the entire book can be summed up as follows;We have to keep walking.Okay Papa.We should eat.Okay Papa.Okay.And that's what passes for a 'great book' now in our TV, WalMart, McDonald's culture."
1,Lackluster prose,"After plodding my way through this novel,I too am in full agreement with those who gave it low marks. The repetitiveness as others have commented on nearly compelled me to abandon the novel at midpoint. At times I would flashback to my Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot' whilst in mid dialog. The difference here is that it worked for Beckett but not for McCarthy. I too agree that his other writings kept me spellbound. Thus the disappointment when I anticipated the same from 'The Road.'"
2,Repetitive,"The plot is similar to that of ""Cold Mountain"" a desperate, dangerous journey, ending in tragedy and hope for the future.Cold Mountain""The Road"" makes for a haunting read, but do yourself a favor.Go to the book store.Read the first 10 pages and the last 10 pages.Book the book back.You will not have missed a thing.The book is so repetitive."
5,The Road,This one is a fabulous read that juxtaposes in one place and time the compassionate and loving dimension of human nature along with its dark and merciless side. It is unremitting in reminding the reader of the terrible side of our nature; but it is simultaneously a story of great hope and an unambiguous declaration of the love that humanity is capable of. It has made me very curious about the authors other works. Not for youngsters.
4,Unbelievable!!,I've never read anything like this...beautifully written...bleak...terrifying...beautiful...full of love...courage...I would highly recommend this book to everyone...whether you enjoy reading it or not it will leave you with a great impression and a character (the father) you can try to emulate if you are ever in difficult circumstances. Unbelievable!!
1,Very Redundant,"I read this book for a forms of literature class and I was very disappointed...It has just about 300 pages of the same old thing...OVER, and OVER, AND OVER!I did not like the ending either..."
2,"A good book, but really, the Pulitzer?","The language is very good most of the time, with sentences that are carefully gone over and tightened. But the book is a bit too precious and the stream of events don't really go anywhere and it gets repetitive. Science Fiction has been writing the same story for years, maybe not with such a mastery of the thesaurus but the story is pretty old at this point.Still worth reading, but far from a masterpiece. Try Samuel Beckett instead."
1,Disappointing,"This was a very strange book and a complete waste of my time to read it. I avidly plugged on looking for answers to questions I had, but they were not forthcoming. For instance, where were they? All we know is that they were heading west to the ocean. What happened to the mother of the child? I got the impression she went off and committed suicide, but again, not clear. One of the paragraphs near the end really puzzled me making it unclear who was the child and who was the father. And of course, I'm assuming it was a nuclear holocaust, but that's not clear either. So overall, I thought this book a big waste of time. The only thing I'm glad about is that it was a quick read. I would not be interested in reading this author again."
1,This guy must have less than a 6th grade education.,This is a complete waist of time. Terrible author. No country for old men is terrible also. You can't make heads or tails out of who is talking when. Who in the world said he could write or who would publish this garbage. Must have a good backer to promote it.
3,"Beautifully written, but in the end comes up empty","The story is beautifully written, and the sparse dialog says much more than could be expressed in twice as many pages. Unfortunately, the narrative itself is repetitive and doesn't move to a conclusion of any kind. You could skip whole chapters and not loose a beat. In the end, the bleak vision feels like it takes you nowhere. I gather the author's point is that life is a pointless struggle, but I don't care for books to be."
3,Agonizing,"We read this book for our bookclub - at my suggestion - although it did give us a lot to talk about, it left all of us feeling so frustrated. I felt as though I was dumped into the middle of the story and got yanked out before it ended. I understand that it is a love story about a father and son, but there wasn't that much dialog between the two which, until I saw the interview with Cormac McCarthy, I would never in a million years would have gotten that. At any rate - it is a quick read.Would not recommend this book - especially not for a Fathers Day gift as Oprah did, she must have missed a few pages or something. YUCK!"
4,Beautiful reading. Sad and strangely inspiring.,"The Road is one of those books that you feel you must recommend.In essence, it is not an apocaliptic father-and-son journey, but a look into our soul.A sad cry and reproach from a future where all our nightmares have come true and all our indifference towards the world and to each other have come to bear.It is a sad remainder that the world -and everything in it that we love- is fragile and rare, and as such should be much closer to the center of our attention..."
5,Exquisite,If you can ignite the fire in the heart of a child then you have passed on the secret of the universe and communed with the intuition of God.
5,Couldn't put it down,Wow - what an amazing book! I couldn't put it down. The book is extremely well written and a completely different subject matter than what I usually read. It was amazing..
5,An exceptional read,This was the first Cormac McCarthy novel I read and absolutely loved it. The way he describes the setting and feelings the characters are experiencing is second to none. You can't help but feel for them. I can not recommend this book more highly to anyone and everyone.
2,I didn't get the hype,I finsihed it. Wasn't that impressed. Enjoyed his other novels more. Read a lot of reviews later about how great it was and wondered what I'd missed...
1,Poorly written and boring story. What is with all the attention?,"This is a poor book. I can not understand all the fuss over this novel. It needs a proof reader. Why is poor grammar a good thing? Reads like a middle school kid wrote it over a weekend.Repeated cannibalism? Get real.I felt like ""The Road"" was overtly copied from many other better novels and movies.""Mad Max"" and ""A Boy and His Dog"" and ""Cherry 2000"" are some movies that come to mind.""The Earth Abides"" is a far better novel.""Alas Babylon"" is a far better novel.The movie ""Carriers"" is a far better story.If you want to read ""the Road"" that is your choice, but I found it a waste of time. In my opinion, had it been written by an new author, it would NEVER have been published."
1,"Buy a copy for your shelf, just don't bother reading it.","Some have called this masterpiece trite, dull and depressing. How silly can they be? That's what makes it a literary work of genius. It's an easy read because it is puffed up with white space and large type. No need to slog through it. Just put it on the shelf so folks will see you read cool stuff. For speculative fiction you don't need to pretend to read, try Jack Vance orSisters of Glass. Literary writing doesn't have to be a bore."
3,Close but no cigar,"Its too bad that CM didnt either have the courage, talent or desire to complete what could very well have been an absolute masterpiece. His utterly convincing, albeit bleak world is simply heart stopping in its fundamental horrors. CM is a genius with the imagery of details. Shame on CM for dropping the ball on his most precious element... the interaction between man and son. As a father, the only thing I was convinced of was that CM most likely did not have children of his own. SPOILER ALERT! Upon reflection I realized that CM did not have the courage to really project himself into the world that he creates. CMs refusal to relinquish his stitched together scenes of 'just in time luck' and his utter cop out of an ending mirrored the mental journey of the father... CM knew what he had to do... but couldnt bring himself to do it!Too bad... it had so much potential."
1,Frustrating Writing,"First time I ever wrote a review. Sad that it has to be a negative one but thats how frustrated I am with Cormac's writing. The sad truth is that after reading 20 pages I'm thinking this book is a waste of my life, I don't have time to re-read every page trying to make sense of it. I wish I read the other 1 star reviews before buying this book. Hope this prevents somebody from wasting their precious time & money."
1,Complete Waste of Time,"This book was a complete waste of time. If you are looking for a ""literary masterpiece"", i.e. a book that says nothing but is chalk full of stupid metaphors and allegories, then you might like it. It is annoying to read due to it not having any punctuation, for starters, but I guess if you are McCarthy you can get away with it. In addition, I hate to be a spoiler, but nothing happens throughout the book!! I will admit it is a page turner, because it leaves you thinking any minute something will happen, but it never really does. One or two interactions with other people on the road, and that's it. 95% of the book is their pathetic cling to survival. Read the first 20 pages and you can put it away, it is the same thing for the rest of the book, and that is not an exaggeration. Unless you are a literature professor, or just a glutton for depressing stories, you will probably be as pissed as me for wasting 5 hours reading it."
2,Not happy with book's appearance,"I received this book in a very timely manner, however I am not happy with the appearance. There is no wear on it; it looks new and never used, but the manufacturer, I'm guessing, cut the pages into several diagonals along the outside edge. I have no idea for the reason behind this. It looks trashy and cheap. This should be in the description of the book. I knew I didn't like shopping online for a reason."
3,post-apocalyptic world destruction,"The Road is a depressing story of an unnamed father and son wandering south through post-apocalyptic world destruction. Most of humanity is dead, all wildlife is dead and all hope is lost. The father and son are starving and barely surviving from the last vestiges of the material world, old cans of preserved food are found amongst the ruins.Ravenous marauders are cannibalizing what remains of humanity people are enslaved, children are born and eaten. It's truly an awful outlook and depressing to read. One senses that McCarthy sees the world as 99% evil and the boy and father as the exception - carrying the fire they would say.The only uplifting part of the book is the father's love for his son. The book ends with some sort of hope, although I am still not sure what it is. It's a good book, not the best I've read in this genre. I'd also add that I found Jose Saramango's Blindness to be a better attempt at this type of work."
1,Can I tell you something? Of course.....ad nauseam,"With the opening description of the obsidian ashen landscape, stark jagged rocks, unrelenting rain, shivering cold, impending death - readers are given imagery that repeats (with word variations) ad infinitum. Surroundings are absolutely, totally, unequivocally, omnipotently bleak and barren. Peppered with human jerky-like bodies and a few random troves of ""goods"" to keep the pair alive through the book, readers ""got"" it from the ""getgo."" Interspersed with the apocalyptic adjectives are stingy offerings of communication between father and son that could be double as caveman speak. Dad has a pat litany of ""of course"" (with no quotation marks, naturally). The paragraphs are spaced widely apart so as to give the illusion that this is, indeed, a full-length novel.Boring, boring, boring!!! The only good thing about this book is that you can knock it out in a few hours. All The Pretty Horses was so superior to this."
3,A little too much,His writing style didn't bother me. I could accommodate the lack of usual punctuation quickly. His jerky narrative ... no problem. It even enhanced the experience a bit. The conversations weren't bad either. How would YOU pass the time in a post-apocalyptic landscape?However ... I think he could have achieved what he did achieve in about 85 to 100 pages.Just my opinion.
3,Rather Depressing,"I found this book interesting, depressing and scary. I realized this is what could happen one day if the world more-or-less almost came to an end except for a few people, or maybe it was a nuclear bomb that was dropped. I felt that I wouldn't want to be one of the survivor's regardless of what happened. I finished it because I wanted to know the ending, which was as depressing as the beginning and the middle."
4,The long road...,"I started this read fully intending to finish. Not soon after beginning, I realized the dark, depressing nature of the long, drawn, similar days would be repetitious and though well written with poingant foreshadowing, I flipped to the end and read just what I expected to read and decided not to continue on the road."
5,Perfect metaphor for the fragile beauty of goodness.,"The overriding metaphor of the novel is somewhat heavy-handed, and certainly impossible (we are more ingenious at survival than he allows), but as a statement about the nature of goodness and love in an empty, meaningless and brutal world, I have never read better."
3,A deep and dark psychological book....,"This is a good book that provokes a lot of reflection on the father and son relationship in general as well as larger questions of life. It is intensely psychological and dark, almost like a good Russian novel. There is some sacrifice of plot our linear movement for depth, but it will engage your attention and move you at a deep level. Other reviewers have talked more about the plot and other elements of the book. As someone who works in a psychological context, I wanted to offer something different by looking at it as a ""deep dive"" into human nature for better or worse. I'm a rather tough reviewer of fiction, so when I give it a 3 that is certainly not negative. You will no doubt enjoy this book, if you like this kind of fiction writing."
4,A Good Novel to Read by Dimming Booklight,"*The Road* is a well crafted survival tale, and McCarthy keeps a small candle burning in its window at the end. If there are high schools one hundred years from now, and teenagers still read novels in high schools, McCarthy's trimmed book may keep company with novels by William Golding and Russell Hoban."
3,"A quick read, but not a page turner","Although there are many things I admire about the way McCarthy writes, story-telling is not one of them (based on this and another of his books). And consequently reading as entertainment falls by the wayside with this book. I've heard that McCarthy doesn't care if people read his books. I think he writes as some sort of personal cathartic experience. I'll let him continue to do that while I select other authors to read. So many books, so little time!"
3,Dark is an understatement,"This book, though well written, is a black hole for the soul. Dismal & dark is an understatement for this work. I had nightmares for 2 consecutive nights after reading it straight through on a Friday night. As a glass half-full type of guy, I can't imagine the darkness in the heart and mind of the author."
4,Easy Read,"For me, it took a while to get used to this way of writing. Once I got used to it I enjoyed the book fully. A father that did everything he could to teach his child how to care for himself was, for me, the high point of the book. The courage and strength of the little boy was amazing and was shown in the writing.A beautiful story with deep meaning."
4,Captivating,"I thought the book was interesting and I wanted to keep reading to see what would happen next. It was not depressing in the sense that you would not want to finish the book. The author has a realistic account of what could happen some day, if there was ever a nuclear war."
5,Wow,"I can not remember the last time I paid so much for a book,nor stayed up so late to read it. From front to back an amazing story. I read it all. My heart pounding. Absolutely amazing."
2,stark,"the stark, sparse writing style of this book suits the subject matter, but is somewhat tedious to read. The seemingly endless travails of the father and son go on and on too long for me. I had to wonder how there were still food, clothes, tools, etc left for the duo to find after years of scavenging by the other survivors. How did the boy learn compassion when all his life was a struggle for survival with other people being the enemy? Also, people are essentially herd animals and probably would have grouped together to survive by cooperation in farming,for example, rather by eating each other. That could only go on for so long before the people ran out. Anyway, the book seemed to me to be haunting in its atmosphere but ultimately not very compelling."
1,Unrealistic and depressing,"I wouldn't waste my time. Everything on the planet is dead except humans and dogs? Really? Everyone IS going to die. I was looking for the happy ending. Boy, was I depressed when I finished reading it...it really never got any better."
1,Depressing Waste of tTime,I wasted my time on The Road. How mundane and depressing. I thought this would get better so I continued to read but it never did. Repetitous and uninspired & dull; it was too boring to pass on to the public library used book store.
1,The Road less taken would be preferable,What an overrated book! I 've heard it was on Oprah's book club so one can only assume she' s getting old and desperate (she should stick to politics she does better!)This is not the consummate book on the after effects of nuclear winter and if the father -son relationship is the apogee of realting we're all in trouble!Real time waster from the literary as well as story line aspect.
2,Planet of the Apes without the Apes,"The writing and descriptions at times are pretty cool but not enough happens in this book. Its walk down the road, get off the road, hide, don't hide, walk down the road again. If a little more was revealed or there was more story included this could have been a cool book. It felt just like Planet of the Apes without the Apes and without the shocking ending."
4,Lives Up to the Hype!,"What a great book....I now can make the (somewhat dubious) claim to have read a book in Oprah's Book Club. This definitely appealed to my fondness for post-Apocalyptic sci-fi. Just unrelentingly bleak; the ""plantation house"" scene is up there on the Gruesomeness Scale with the best of Stephen King. Really glad I picked this up, and now understand what the fuss was all about."
2,"Well Written, Too Depressing","I was impressed with the author's images and writing ability. However, the story was so depressing, I couldn't finish the book. I certainly don't plan on seeing the movie."
3,Not a bad book... not really a great book either.,"Definitely well-written and an interesting glance into a view of the world after the apocalypse but that's about it. I can't say it was captivating or even all that entertaining to read. One of those books that ended and I shrugged and put it aside and really didn't think anymore of it. I find it interesting that The Road elicits so many raves, often times hinging on the development of the characters. In addition to robust characters, a captivating story would be nice."
4,"The Road- the end of the world, not the end of hope","I could not put this book down once I started it. While I knew the tale would be mostly bleak and tell a saddening tale, I did not realize it would spin such a story of hope and faith. I can easily see how this book, and later film, can be used to demonstrate the power of a greater good beyond our expectations and the power of mankind.Despite some disturbing images (which I figured would be present- it's a Cormac McCarthy book), the momentum of this book built its way along until the very last page. The end does not disappoint, and neither does anything else in this epic story."
2,"Should be a short story, not a novel","I love ""end of the world as you know it"" films and books, therefore I jumped into ""The Road"". The book, though, is mostly boring. I do not need detailed explanations for plots, I can fill in the blanks and imagine, but there are plot problems (I will not give them away, it is not fair). If the story had 40 pages it would be great. With hundreds more you keep looking ahead just to see if something finally happens."
4,Worth a read,"Terrible and beautiful, I keep telling people. Sobering. Easy to read but a bit difficult to come to grips with. Excellent read."
3,Sad,"Very difficult read. For such a long painful journey,the book seemed to end too quickly and too vaguely. So sad."
2,Lousy,"I'm a big fan of apocalyptic literature. Hey, I grew up in the 80s under the spectre of Soviet nukes- how could you NOT enjoy something about trying to survive after the bombs drop?Well, this hunk 'o cheese isn't worth buying. When an author can't be bothered to write complete sentences or include punctuation, then I can't be bothered to consider it in any sort of serious light. I understand he was trying to convey a sense of oppression and desolation, and he did. There are some pretty decent scenes that really put you into the moment in this book. It's not a total waste.But I have to ask: how many times can you read ""they walked through ash"" in one single volume? Apparently I've exceeded my limit, because it just didn't work for me. You can read into the story if you like, and try to throw a deeper meaning onto the bare bones of the events in this novel. Personally, I didn't care for it, and don't understand all the hype about it."
1,The Road,This is the last time I listen to Oprah regarding any book. This book is dark but meaningless. I had to force myself to finish this pointless tragic story.How this became a best seller is beyond me.
1,Reader Beware,"I read barely half of the book. Who would guess that I couldn't get through 114 pages?I suppose whatever happened could happen but I found it to be a profoundly depressing and disturbing book.Didn't read any reviews first,just downloaded it from my library. They don't have a huge selection soI took a chance. I read for pleasure; this book made me feel ill. Although unfinished, I still think aboutthe parts I did read. Haunting.Lesson: read the reviews first."
3,Boring,"Honestly, I was bored at about the half way mark. I get tired of reading of other people's journey's as though there is some hierarchical order."
4,B+,"The grammar and wording of Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is a metaphor showing the slow decay of humanity through the breakdown of speech and the written word. There are a lot of things McCarthy throws at the reader, some of it painfully obvious, some of it challenging. The former are the religious overtures, which by the end of the novel become tiresome; the interjections of the author feel contrived. The latter are the numerous symbols McCarthy uses to convey the ideas of destruction, tenderness, and sacrifice. The novel is a bleak one: repetition drives the narrative (there are only a few ways to say 'gray' and 'cold'), and not much happens, but it moves surprisingly quickly and the horrifying images will stay with the reader for a long time. The ending is hopeful yet didactic in an unsatisfying way. Darkness is faced head-on, and the author artfully and sparely creates a character study that examines human survival in the face of total ruin."
5,Brilliant!! But not for the faint of heart.,"McCarthy requires the reader to draw upon their own deepest strength to follow ""the road"" with his characters."
2,Life Sucks and Then You Die?,I finished reading the book and asked myself what was the point of the book supposed to be?
2,Just did not do it for me,"I guess after the apocalypse there is no need for quotation marks because this book does not use them. Occasionally you are not certain if some one is doing something or speaking. I found the deviations from the writing norms annoying rather than ground breaking.This book is lacking. You are thrown into the life of these two wanderers without much explanation. Through the course of the reading you assume the explanations are coming but it just does not happen. They never tell you what trigger the apocalypse nuclear weapons, asteroid? I'm still not sure. How were people able to survive?They say the themes are love, loyalty and devotion but what about stupidity, obsession and insanity? Could go either way. Maybe, i'm too much of a skeptic or lack imagination, but i'll wait till the movie is on TV. I did not pick up on any true endearing qualities in this tale."
2,dreary and grey,"I read the book ""The Road"", after I had seen the author interviewed on Oprah. I disliked it intensely. It is well-written as a novel, but thoroughly depressing and dreary. Oprah and others said how hopeful it was in the end; I didn't see it. I can't remember being so sure so early that this was a book I disliked. I sold my brand new copy right away to the second-hand bookstore, so certain was I that I would never read it again, or recommend it to anyone.I also had a feeling as I read it...this is very familiar; what book does it remind me of? Suddenly it came to me - ""Waiting for Godot"" and ""Endgame"" by Samuel Beckett - two plays I love, by an author who has long been a favourite of mine. He can be extremely depressing in the view he paints of man's life and the meaning of life, but there is always humour, at least to me. ""The Road"" was humourless."
1,Disappointment,"This is easily one of the most disappointing, boring and poorly-written books I have ever read..... really! I could barely stay awake and finish it. I find the glowing reviews curious. Strange, since the other books by McCarthy were very entertaining and well-written. Perhaps the film will work, the book didn't. Not for me."
2,Why all the hype?,"I ordered this book due to an interest in post apocalyptic fiction, and after reading it, I still can't see why this book was so hyped. I kept reading hoping it would get better, but it never quite went anywhere. If you're looking for an interesting read, look somewhere else."
4,Solid and sturdy,This was a gift for my grandson who loves wolves. It's sturdy enough that he'll probably lose it before breaking it. This is one of those simple gifts that might possibly evoke memories for a lifetime.
5,Daughter loves it,"Our daughter loves playing with this and the other wolves she got from Scheich. She has so much fun playing with them, and I know they won't apart like some other brands do, it is well made."
4,Cute candy bars,"These make great BARS. They are really thick, but you can just not put as much chocolate in and they would be fine."
3,Contextually Useful,"This was useful in context. If you had to write crossplatform javascript for 4.x browsers, it told you what features worked in which browsers. Overall, it merits 3 stars because it saved me a lot of time back then.The book is utterly useless if you aren't already proficient at Javasript. There are no examples. It seems like other reviewers were expecting a ""how-to"" book, and this was not a how-to book."
1,I cannot believe wrox put this out,"I cannot belive this is a Wrox book. All it lists property methods and events. There is hardly any explaination on how to use them, very little examples, and little on what they do. This book makes me think twice about buying a Wrox book and I usually go to them first. The only thing this book is good for is for giving you clues as to what to search for on the internet when you have a problem or a question. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Very much useless,"This is alphabetically arrangement of unrelated concepts that only have in common that theyre are linked to JavaScript.This is pretty much useless if you are looking for an anwer to a meaningful question. It is only useful in the case where you know the class/method and are looking for the table ""which browser does it support it"".I definitely do not recommend it."
1,This is not a Book. It's a JOKE!,"It's unbelievable, that WROX has published this book. As a matter of fact it would be unbelievable if any publisher printed this book. It's so worthless and unusable it's a shame. No more comments. This pile of paper is not worth even one second of my time. I'm lucky that I can still return it to the bookstore. It's like someone wrote all of the words of English language without any explanation in a book and called it a dictionary."
2,Confusing Title,"I found the title of this book completely misleading -- I would never refer to this book as to ""Programmer's Reference"". It is more like JavaScript language history overview. If one wants to know about the history of JavaScipt or what the difference between some implementations is -- it may be right book for that purpose. But if one need to have the language reference that is easy to navigate and which contains the details important for programmers, like method arguments description and what that method does -- then this book may be a disappointment."
2,Organization Is Horrible; No Index....,I was thinking about buying this book and read through it at a bookstore....I was completely confused. It did seem like a great reference book on JS but everything is organized by alpha and THERE IS NOW INDEX!!!!It's just a cross reference which I found completely confusing and illogical.Sorry Cliff.
3,Works,"What can I say, it's cleaning solution. works well, gets my airbrush clean, ummm, it's really clear? Nice bottle, the top opens and the stuff comes right out. Ready to go!"
1,Ambiguous cross marketing representation resulted in the purchase of an unusable product,"Bought the MASTER Care Decorating Airbrush Kit as gift for my pastry chef daughter and this product was recommended during the ordering process. When my daughter saw the cleaner, she informed me that you use only alcohols to clean airbrushing used for food so this cleaner is a waste of money. Amazon should not have cross-marketed a food product with a non-food airbrushing product."
5,Dose a good job,Dose what it's supposed to do. Cleans my air brushes. I use it also to clean my brushes. works well
2,For amatuers learning about their new DLSR,"For some reason I thought this was going to be a fun photoshop-tricks type instruction guide. And even though I am pretty good at PS, I don't normally do ""trick"" stuff. Hence, the purchase.However, I had this on my kindle for less than five minutes before I deleted it and applied for a refund.The ""tricks"" are such basic things such as how to do depth of field (and why), filters, angles, extended exposures, etc.I mean...there is even a small chapter on why to up the contrast.Good info for people just getting into photography,and who want to know what interesting things they could do by adjusting manual settings and/or fussing in a photo-editing program...but not really for anyone more advanced than that.It should also be noted that even if you have a kindle fire or are viewing a kindle app on a computer or iPad...the kindle version only has black and white photos of poor quality. Not particularly helpful when discussing filters and such."
3,Not as satisfying as you'd think,"Macaroni and cheese is the ultimate comfort food, and anyone who does a lot of hiking, definitely wants comfort food. Unfortunately, this one just doesn't hold up.First, there is far more sauce than macaroni, and you'll end up drinking half of it, as the sauce doesn't thicken adequately either. The macaroni itself is good, there just isn't enough of it. The cheese sauce, however, leaves a little to be desired. I can't quite put my finger on what is wrong, but I think the best way to describe it is that it has too much of a powdered milk taste to it. Definitely not one of the better Mountain House dinners, and this surprises me, as Mountain House dinners are usually pretty good.Try the Mountain House Turkey Tetrazzini or Chicken ala King, which are much, much better."
3,DISNEY COLLECTOR,"I recently ordered this book for my niece because she & I love WALT DISNEY story books as well as the films,but this book came very unprotected and bent but it's ok because at least we were to read it and enjoy!"
3,A nice story.,"This is a paperback story about the growth and adventures of the young Emperor Kuzko as he tries to cope with being turned into a llama. It's a very good story, especially since it's one of only a few Disney films where nobody gets killed in the course of the story. My complaint with the book is that The Emperor's New Groove, more than any other Disney film, relies heavily on pace, humor, and mood to sustain interest; the plot itself is really only a window-dressing for the back-and-forth character interactions, most of which are lost in the transition. Oh, and the artwork is beautiful."
5,Excellent customer support!,"We bought this program for our 13-year old twins. They will be heading to high school next year and feel they need every advantage we can give them. My son started the program and, in less than a week, his reading speed has improved. The drills are diverse and fun. He loves that the computer counts his words for him and times him. I have talked with customer support twice now regarding loading the program onto more than one home computer and upgrading so we can have multiple users on one computer. The customer support response has been FANTASTIC! Support has been patient and really explained all my options and how to best use the program. This program and its customer support are great."
5,Ace Reader,We are very pleased with Ace Reader! Our son is using it to help his reading skills. He really enjoys using the program! This is a huge help to a homeschooling mother. The customer service was incredibly helpful when we had questions! Well worth the investment!
2,sound driver problems,"I tried it on 3 different PCs of different platforms. All gave the same error message. I LOVE the idea of software, and we always want more educational fun titles!"
1,didn't work,"I bought this for my son and it never worked on his computer. It said it was compatable with his operating system,but it had problems from the moment we started to install it. My husband is a computer programmer and has been fixing computers for 15 years and couldn't get this to work."
1,doesn't work,"I couldn't get it to work on my computer. My husband tried and couldn't either, and he's a computer engineer."
1,Dangerous toy,"We bought four of these hat umbrellas for our vacation with our grandchildren. While this umbrella hat is a novel and fun idea, it turned out to be dangerous, as the spokes from the umbrella came loose from the stays and stuck out. Being that this could've poked the wearer in the eye, we disposed of them. Not a good buy by any means. You really do get what you pay for."
1,Zero stars. Waste of money.,The first time I tried to open this it was broken. I bought it as a gag gift and never even got to see it worn. I am not happy with this item.
1,Not cool! It broke already! :(,I would not recommend this toy to anyone as it broke within 2 days of my son receiving it as a present. :(
4,Safe in the sun,Keep the children safe from the sun for their protection. Great at the beach or out hiking or just sitting for a game.
2,"""show off"" music","I found this selection disappointing. I am a lower level intermediate player, I guess, but I probably could have learned most of the hymns if I thought they were worth the effort. The variations are quite predictable--the same techniques for nearly all the hymns. They are too ""fancy"" for most worship circumstances, I would say. Also - it seems to me that one would have to be more acrobat than pianist to master all the crossed hands nonsense."
1,Unhelpful Guide,"Not a good guidebook. Mostly useless. Not enough detail or unique info to justify the purchase. If I could get my money back, I would."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"I have a Samsung D807, and this works fine- charges quickly, good chord length, pretty simple."
3,"Great sound, tweeter problems","When the tweeter isn't blown, they are nice. However, I've blown two of them (in the same speaker). Now that Klipsch owns them, it looks like it might be harder to order a new one. We'll see.Yes, I listen to loud music. Driven by a Yamaha HTR 5590. AS f2's in front (right tweeter blown), AS F1's rear surround, JBL studio series for front and rear center, and a Klipsch 15"" sub."
4,Athena AS-F2.2,"After reading the review of the orignal AS-F2 in Stereophile I decided to check these out. I saw a great price on Amazon so I said why not. To be fair the speakers are still in the 50 hour break in period recommended by the owners manual and I have not finished tweeking my system to optimize the sound. That having been said these are good speakers for the money. As advertised they deliver a lot of pretty tight bass. Right now I find them a little harsh in the upper ranges but that could be because of the things I mentioned above. I am running them with a ADCOM GFA-5400, and an Acurus RL-11. The primary sources I have been using are an NAD C-660, an Acurus ACD-11 and a Polk xrt-12."
2,2.5 stars,"I'm afraid I don't share the sentiment of other reviewers regarding the merits of this recording. I found the band to be unexceptional and uninspired. The drums and bass in particular are often unimaginative and stiff. The keyboard player isn't much better. Where the leader and guitarist Mario Millo is the strongest musician he too lacks fire and passion in his work. His vocals are somewhat similar to Ambrosia, a bit too high in register for my taste. The compositions are lengthy but they go no where and unlike with other epic minded bands (Yes, ELP) you lose interest in the pieces. If you like the mellower side of prog-rock you may enjoy them (Ambrosia, Moody Blues). I'd suggest you look elsewhere...Simon"
4,fun while it lasted,"My daughter received this piano for her 2nd birthday in November 2005. She absolutely loved it. She played with it every day, that is, until Christmas brought her new toys. After the excitement of the new toys wore down she grabbed the piano to play with it, just to find out it didn't work! We replaced the batteries, but still nothing. I contacted Little Tykes. The response was ""sorry we didn't manufacture it"". I still plan on contacting the manufacturer. I know it was inexpensive, but I expected much more use from it. I am still thinking of purchasing another to try because my daughter liked it so much. And, yes, the volume starts out way too loud."
3,Too many Christmas carol melodies!,"My 20-month-old son loves this toy. It's very durable and provides a lot of interactive opportunities. BUT what neither the online product description nor the packaging tells you is that about one-third of the 19 ""demo songs"" are Christmas carol melodies! With all the children's songs in the world, I cannot understand why Little Tikes didn't include a broader selection. Since small children play the same thing over and over and over again, be prepared for Christmas tunes year-round with this toy!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this for my 3 year-old. The volume on the toy is too loud, we have to constantly ask him to turn it down. As another review stated, the demos are mostly Christmas music.Our biggest dissapointment is that the learning feature doesn't work the way we thought it would. It doesn't matter if you press a lighted key or a regular key, the piano still plays the same tune. There really isn't any learning involved with this toy.My son has had the toy for about a month and only picks it up occasionally. He has other musical toys that he plays with more frequently."
3,Acoustic Troubadour,"Having created a body of work in Aztec Camera that seems destined to remain overlooked, Roddy Frame has embarked on a solo career that, in its sheer modesty, will only add to the public's ignorance. On Surf, his second release, Frame continues in the vein of modern acoustic troubadour. These thirteen tracks comprise no more than Frame's aching voice and beautifully strummed and/or picked acoustic accompaniment. It's a lovely record, with two songs that will be in Frame's repertory until the day he dies: the radio heartbreak of the title track, and the cad's lament ""I Can't Start Now"". If you're a fan of singer-songwriters and you don't know Roddy Frame, you could do worse than starting here."
1,don't waste your money,"I was truly disappointed with this book. It is not so much a comparative synopsis of the feminine in the various world religions, but more of a lengthy, personal account of excuses for the author's sexuality. It sounds as if he is defending himself throughout the whole book, rather than just being happy within himself and his relationship. He uses his knowledge of relgions of the world to try and show how his relationship is ok. I did not even resell this book; I put it in the trash to get one less out of the world. What a shame that the book couldn't focus on the subject to which it professes."
5,Unbelievably Good Service,"I ordered this product on 09/07 and it was scheduled for delivery between 09/13 and 09/16. Much to my pleasant surprise, I received my order on 09/09!"
4,Helped thru weaning time,"Good product kept all things 'in balance' when puppies were wormed, event sent some home with puppies to their new homes."
3,Not for 7-12!,Much too young for middle school students. Great for elementary. I was disappointed that the book implies it's good for 4-12!! It's definately NOT!! I can't use it for my students.
4,Good material for younger students,I thought the book had a lot of good ideas if you are teaching a younger age group--elementary or middle school. Most of the activities were too basic for my high school students. I have juniors and seniors who are enrolled in a youth apprentice program so they have had classes like anatomy and physiology that make them much more advanced than most of the activities in the book.
3,"Good magazine article, but not meaty enough for a book","Chapter 4, about the fall of Sustainable Competitive Advantage and the rise of Situational Monopoly, was worth reading. But most of the rest of the book is fluff.If I had had to pay full price for this book, I would have given it two stars. There is a useful concept here in chapter 4, worth the fiver I paid for my copy used.All too many business books, especially from first-time authors, fall into this trap. They take their model, which has some utility in some limited space, and arbitrarily expand it to cover the entire business universe. Such is the case here.Fortunately, as of late 2007, this book seems to be available as a remainder only from third-party sellers. Find a cheap copy and read chapter 4!"
4,Good cross section,"Good tracks, nice cross section of hits. There could always be more and many will argue for the inclusion of their favorites. I enjoy the nostalgia of the ones on the three discs and even though not all were my choices, they still represent the decade of the 80's. Turn up the volume, sit back and return to the good ol' days!!"
4,LOVE 80s music,I am such an 80s child. This box set is great. Has a lot of the great songs of the 80s.
1,not worth it,"Too expensive, no rap, missing too much to be worth [amt]. There are many other better compilations, especially those from Rhino."
3,Lots of memories (of better songs),"It's a good collection of tunes from the 80s that appeals to those of us who came of age during the time. But, after a listen-through, it left me craving a collection with a few more of the high-points from the decade."
3,Do my ears decieve me? Is that NFG??,"sounds like a water-down version of NFG but since they are like NFG, then I like them."
2,Saves The Day? They wish!,"When I heard this EP sounded "" a lot like Saves the Day of old,"" I thought awesome, I'll get it. Please...this is so little like them its sad. I play Saves the Day as loud as possible in my car, The Starting Line? Well, it only makes me feel like crawling up in a blanket and sucking my thumb. Not as good as NFG even, pretty pathetic. This is barely even pop-punk, it is so soft. I do like the first two songs though, catchy if anything.If you want Saves the Day, buy Saves the Day, they are easily the most talented, creative band out. They absolutely rock like punk should!"
2,Not A New Found Glory's latest release.,"Come on, people, don't you realize that this is just a big ripoff of ""Nothing Gold Can Stay""-era New Found Glory? I guess that's why all the NFG kids in my school like this so much. Because it's a band that's not big yet (so they can feel like they're deep in the scene), yet they also have a sound that's not anything we haven't already heard before (so as not to scare them, and not confuse them vs. their Jay-Z records). I guess these guys would be good if they were SO much like NFG, and if NFG didn't exist I'd be telling you how good the Starting Line is. But in reality, they're just another pop punk band. ""Killing the scene, one band at a time."""
3,too much of other bands like NFG...,"it's sad that Starting Line tries on this CD to be a kind of NFG Copy. their ""own"" songs they wrote earlier were real good, they had a lot of ska in it, very sad, it's not a bad CD, but the earlier ones are much better"
2,Not so funny,This movie is ok but not that great i was expecting more but it is just a movie with a bad exagerated plot.Save money by renting it first.
5,Amazing!,"This is the kind of movie that makes fun of the worst possible tragedies that could happen to you... and in the same Day. made me laugh during the whole movie and I watch it over and over again, the best thing about this movie is the slang spanish used, but english subtitles will make you laugh just as much."
3,Very Intersting!,"This movie is a little crazy, to say the least, but entertaining. It is in Spanish, but has English subtitles. I found this movie funny in some parts and violent in a few other areas, but overall, I found it to be a pretty entertaining movie."
3,Best of the Main Trilogy,"As others have noted, Cook's ""All Darkness Met"" is the best of the three main sequence books in his ""Dread Empire"" series (I read the version contained in hisA Cruel Windomnibus). Unfortunately, that's faint praise. One big point in this book's favor is that Cook finally overcame his tendency to write using descriptive text instead of using dialog. So, this book read just like the novel it is instead of like an historical description. Another plus is that the plot is much better developed in this book than it was in the previous one. But, like the previous book, this one suffers from too-many-names-and-placesitis. Trying to keep all the major and minor characters straight was a chore in itself. The plethora of places described (mostly for battles) became irritating enough that I stopped trying to keep them straight. So, even though this is the best of the three books, I'm still only rating it at an OK 3 stars out of 5."
4,Essays - First Series,"This is Emerson. The language is old fashioned, probably was in the mid-nineteenth century. But this is the intellectual foundation of transendentalism."
2,unfortunate format,"This edition is meant for young people or students, not serious readers. It has large print and a format which makes one think of an elementary school textbook. Not appealing to me, nor what I had expected as there was no indication of this simplification."
2,LOW KEY CD,"Back in the 70's I loved Lenny Williams dance music""Choosing You"" and ""You Got me Running"" so I figured it would be a good dance CD but it's not. Other than those 2 songs the rest of the CD is all slow music which is ok. Not recommended if your looking for dance music."
5,Lenny Williams Sings For Lovers,This album contains the pain and passion of one man's experiences that are similar to our own experiences.
1,Never received the item,"Ordered the dictionary on June 5, 2008. As of July 6, 2008, have not received the item. This is not the way to do business if you are ordering an item from a vendor that is supported by Amazon."
5,Gr8-Dophilus by NOW Foods,Fantastic product! Straightened out my digestive system and excellent to take traveling to other countries!!! Handles both diahrea and constipation. Have recommended to family members and they too find it an excellent product.
1,another author capitalizing on religion,"This is just another author trying to make money off people's superstitions. Instead of inspiring people and teaching them to look within themselves for strength, he tries to make them think they are weak and should look to a deity and mythology for answers. Clifton says that 80% of Americans are Christians - that is because it is what they are taught. If children were taught all religions, they would probably choose a religion other than Christianity upon learning that Christianity is based on fear and intolerance. This book was very disappointing."
1,What went wrong in Ohio??,"The only thing that went wrong in Ohio is that it gave the idiot Dems another thing to WHINE ABOUT!! Which we Republicans are pleanty tired of!! Mrs. Miller, please don't quit your day job!! The book really needs help."
3,More Edith Wharton than Charlotte Bronte,"The sequel to Gaywyck, this is more Edith Wharton than Charlotte Bronte, set as it is among the ""smart set"" in turn of the century New York and Newport. As with Gaywyck, this concerns ethereally beautiful heroes in love, struggling to come together despite society's disapprobation and the marriage of one of them. Much mental anguish is suffered by the main characters which leads to much brooding by the sea in both fair weather and foul, the only really ""gothic"" element in this novel. The dialog has some jarring modernisms and sounds a bit too fey in places. (Virga's transcription of a New York dialect is also embarrassingly risible.) But it's a page-turning, entertaining read, nonetheless."
1,"missing piece, bad quality","I only received one of the two pieces...I tried to inquire but received no response? So I don't know what to do? It wasnt chrome either it was painted black,and had a poor finish, wasn't debured, and it cut my finger. Very disappointed, I think I'm finished with Ford and any of their products for good, and I will tell everyone I practice with how poor their quality is!"
3,Mushrooms are not plants,"Summary:1. Plants have chlorophyll and can produce their own food, fungi live off others, and they cannot produce their own food.2. Plants reproduce through seeds and pollen, fungi reproduce through spores3. Plants have roots, stem sand leaves. Fungi only have filaments which attach to the host.4. Plants are the producers in the eco system, fungi are the decomposers.5. The cell walls on plants are made of cellulose, while those of fungi are made of chitin.Read more: Difference Between Fungi and Plants | Difference Between | Fungi vs Plants [...]"
2,No show,"I have greatly appreciated the excellent service I've had for years from Amazon.com however, on this order I was disappointed. Although I was advised that this item was shipped,and my VISA was charged, the order did not arrive, and I was notified that it could not be delivered to my address. Given that this same address is saved in my Amazon account and the address I've used both before and since for similar orders,I suspect this order was in fact out of stock. My VISA was reimbursed but of course I paid the exchange costs. In future if an item is unavailable I would prefer being advised of this rather than incurring VISA and exchange charges and being delayed in acquiring the items I need."
4,it sounds like this: -l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-,"This music strives to be upredictable. No element wants to reveal where the next will go. In fact, while listening to it, the best you can do to predict direction is to reason that where a section seems like it will go is the opposite of where it will. The music directly juxtaposes sounds that are almost attacking with ethereal bits & surprising electronic things. Stockhausen's description of the aim of the piece is that it not resolve or have any noticeable build toward climax, that it present the standard horizontal perception of time with thorough verticality, which results in a sense of timelessness. It's so...[almost] random that it's not music that ever fades into the background. That it's always surprising makes you stare at the speakers for answers until the cd ends without warning."
3,"It's true what said ""A Customer"" in his review here?",I know and like this work from school (conservatory) and I would like to have a cd version without be forced to go in Germany at the Stockhausen Foundation to have an enormous tape copy of the original tape...
5,This Is Probably Stockhausen's Best,"I like this one or _Mantra_ best out of the ones I've been able to get my hands on. And that's the beauty of Stockhausen: you like each piece on its own terms. Each piece comes from its own set of suppositions, guaranteeing a unique experience every time. This one here is certainly one of the scariest pieces, but this is a horror that is transformative as you realize that the uncanny electric glissandoes are perfectly in tune with the glissandoes of the human psychic mechanism."
2,Only an OKAY cookbook,"Some of the recipes are okay. Unfortunately, almost every recipe in this book needs to be reworked somehow. Though generally veggie-friendly, the recipes are completely UNHEALTHY! Lots of heavy cream, eggs, whole-fat cheese, mayonnaise, etc., are featured in this book. Many of the recipes, if you lighten them or substitute, are fantastic. However, if you are not a seasoned vegetarian and not used to doing this for every other cookbook you own, this book is not for you. If you are a new vegetarian, start somewhere else!"
2,I guess the book is almost vegetarian.,"I received this book as a gift and I am going to try and return it today. Some of the recipes call for chicken broth and others for worcestshire sauce, hardly vegetarian ingredients. Also, these recipes focus so much on eggs, cheese, and butter that many are hardly any healthier than eating meat.Since the author is a meat-eater, I guess this book would be good for someone who was trying to transition into a vegetarian lifestyle, but, if you are already veggie, there are much better cookbooks on the market"
5,Short and Sweet,"One of the best in an excellent series(although more James Bond-like than the previous eight). It's a shame that many dismiss the Helm books as just another bad action/adventure series(this is largely due to the horrible titles, horrible covers, and horrible Dean Martin movies). This is the greatest hard-boiled spy series ever written and puts Ian Fleming to shame. Great fun!"
4,Great Stuff Typical Matt Helm,Not for the faint of heart. No sissies allowed. If you like James Bond you will love Helm.
1,His last good one,This was R. L. Stine's last good book. All of the ones after this are really stupid. As a matter of fact his writing has always been bad. Now this freak is just in it for the money and his 800 word vocabualary. He blew it big time. He is a weird writer. I suggest a good book. Animorphs that is a good series that will be good for a while.
2,It was'nt scary at all!!! Dont bother buying it!!,"I saw the show and it sucked! I just wonder what ""Return to Terror Tower"" is like, I HOPE not like this one!!!!! I think it deserved more than 1 star just because it wasnt ULTRA BAD!!!"
3,This is o.k,"I just read the the book A Night In Terror Tower. Eddie and Sue are brother and sister. They are going to vist London,England for the first time. They was visit the Terror Tower. I liked the book better than the movie because the book tells alot of information."
2,I EXPECTED MORE,"I expected more. R.L. Stine would make a better plot with the background of the story, but he preferred to chose the easy-way-out. Contradiction's, incongruitie's and........ oh sorry! i was forgotten this is a child-focused story!"
3,OK book i guess I'd give it a thums up,"A Night in Terror Tower was an ok story. Some of it was confusing, it wasn't explained. The story was coinsidental, everything was planned out. Some parts of the book popped out at me and some parts were very boring. You should read this book and see what I'm talking about."
5,Great Book!,"This book's a bit controversial among established writers, and I know wonderful and successful writers on both sides of this fence. It seems you either ""get"" this book and can use it, or you don't. Personally, I love it. But then, I love movies and plotting and dissecting stories to figure out why they work or don't work. You have to decide for yourself."
5,Take The Journey Yourself!,"If you love telling stories or listening to them, you will love this book. It helped me write 2 very successful screenplays. MGJ"
2,Failed Aims,"I started reading _The Writer's Handbook_ with great expectations and ended up disappointed.While the author tries to appeal both the novices and the veterans alike, he fails in both accounts.For a veteran writer looking for a precise and practical guide, this book is too verbose, too repetitive, and needlessly redundant.For a novice looking for help, her situation is far worse. Immediately she will be confused by all the things the author throws at her. All these talks about archetypes, psychological functions, and dramatic functions without any concrete examples (with detailed analysis) are mind boggling. Going through the journey without a comprehensive case study is disorientating.The book is further hampered by the lack of an index, a more comprehensive bibliography, errors in mythology, and the totally distracting bit about the Seekers."
5,Start here,"Best Tracks: Dead Egyptian Blues, Park Avenue & Tyson Street, LullabyThis CD, originally released in 1992, has several songs that were previously released by Keith and Ezra when they sold only tapes.Sam's Last Boogie, Sing It One More Time Like That, Park Avenue & Tyson Street, How Many Times A Fool, and Lullaby have all been slightly revamped for the additional instruments--which doesn't take away from the originals.This CD showcases what they boys are all about. Good music, good musicianship, and just a great album."
5,Best Horn EVER!,"OK I have a big truck, and don't want a wimpy horn...Who doesn't? About three years ago I bought a cheap set of WOLOs with a two plastic air horn set up and a small on demand compressor, and they sounded ok...for a while. Living in Alaska, where we are subjected to lots of crazy weather, the ole plastic horns deterioated and sounded worse than stock. Thats when I decided to ""Go BIG or Go Home!"" I purchased the cannonball express and the only complaint i have is they are so big i t took forever to find a place for them. I finally mounted them inside my bumper where it has a mount for a winch. These horns are HUGE! you need a spot approximaly 1ft wide x 1ft high x 1.5ft long to get them mounted in. Is it worth it? OH YEAH! These things will make an unsuspecting person wet themselves!!! AWESOME!"
5,Only Amazon had it!!!,"Our daughter received this doll as a gift almost 2 years ago and has loved it so much that it's really weathered and tattered now... which is why we desperately needed a new one. I have nothing but perfect praise for it. It's soft face makes it perfect for babies and young toddlers (our daughter is almost 2 now). You can make up all sorts of stories with it. It's got little legs under the nightie, which you can't see in the picture. It washes SUPER well (gosh, ours must have been washed & dried thousands of times!) and it has kept its shape. The seller, through Amazon, was super quick too. We did not buy it for its collection value. We think it's a cute, nice ""first doll"". All in all, 10 on 10 for this purchase!"
3,"A Beautiful Book, But...","I am going to be honest with you, while The Gift of Southern Cooking is a beautiful cookbook, just be careful before picking it up. This one is certainly not for the health-conscious chef. I hate to even say that because I sound like an uptight party-pooper, but many of these recipes cook with lard or bacon fat--I was a little shocked. Needless to say, there isn't any nutritional information about these recipes either. That being said, this is a beautiful cookbook with many interesting and traditional recipes."
4,cookbook,"Some items are difficult to find in local grocery stores, but alternative ingredients are provided."
3,Missing Miss Lewis,"I just received my copy of this book, and it's lovely to glance at. I was very disappointed, however, that Edna Lewis's voice cannot be found in its pages. Also, from the description and reviews, I was expecting a well-researched book with good historical background for the recipes, particularly about the influence of enslaved Southerners on the cuisine. It's not there. The recipes seem well-done, but it's just a standard Southern cookbook."
4,Southern Memories,I have read and reread the pages of this cookbook like a friendly novel. If you are exploring Southern cuisine for the first time or hunting for an old family favorite from your childhood this is the book. Both authors have opened their minds and hearts for THE GIFT. This book will be passed down to one of my lucky children.
3,Trow & Holden wedges and shims,"The wedges are a fair bit shorter than the ones that I have used in the past but I don't think that that will make much difference in performance, however, the combined taper of the shims is not equal to the taper of the wedge. This results in all of the splitting force being delivered at the top of the drilled hole and not equally along the entire length of the shims. There is 1/4"" difference in overall cross section from top to bottom. I would think that the force should be equally applied. They way it is now some of the splitting force could be lost to crumbling of the stone at the rim of the drilled hole."
2,two and a half stars,"This is not a bad book, just not nearly as good as the usual Teach Yourself series. The Teach Yourself Beginner's French Grammar is much better, and no less advanced.This is very poorly organized as a reference. Even the index is skimpy. It mostly follows the organization of a ""topics"" test -- which is not how I want a grammar book organized. That said it does a decent enough job of running over basic French grammar. But there are a lot of books in this area and this is one of the weaker."
5,A good source of enjoyment and education,"We will never know exactly how these songs sounded when the citizens of Boston were darting black looks to the British regulars on the streets, but I would wager quite a bit that these renditions come pretty close. Of course the ""American"" accents are an anachronism; but most listeners might be puzzled to hear British accents used for these anti-British songs (with one exception, composed by a British regular!)I have already used selections from this CD to a groups of 3rd and 5th graders and they loved it. So teachers, take note, but be sure they have the words in front of them. A very valuable educational tool that also happens to be a very enjoyable program to hear for its own sake. And as with most New World releases, the annotations alone are worth the price of the product."
1,Review of the CD Birth of Liberty,"The Good News; The music in the reels, marches and ftc. are great. The harpsichord is wonderful.The bad news; The singers have opera quality voices and they're much too polished for the Revolutionary era. The common soldier and people would have been the ones who would have sung these song."
5,The Patrick System is first-rate,"None of the previous reviewers have mentioned the most important thing about this book: the Patrick System. This method of playing craps, which he explains about two thirds of the way through the book (and which begins with the brilliant move of betting both the ""Pass Line"" AND ""Don't Pass"" at the same time!!) gives the bettor the lowest vig (best odds) against the house of any system I know..."
2,Too preachy.,"While the basics are described adequately, the author's personal preferences are forced upon the reader without qualified support. The methods and approaches described are not statistically correct and the author ""talks down"" to the reader. There is relatively little new insight offered into the game that other books offer in a more readable form."
1,A waste of time,"John Patrick's gambling strategy espouses a risk averse philosophy that does little to help the player in the long run. For example, he advocates placing the any craps bet to hedge the pass line wager. Any ""gambling expert"" can tell you that hedging does not work. Furthermore, the house edge on the any craps bet is over 11%!Another problem with his book is the ""big four"". First of all, money management ""systems"" have no effect on the long term winnings of the player. No matter what ""system"" the player uses, his/her winnings will fall on a curve dictated by the expectation of the game being played. According to Patrick, however, they are a cardinal rule to gambling success. Lastly, trends can only be seen in hindsight. If you are interested in learning craps, buy another book."
4,Pawn structure and long term planning!,"I did hear that saying that, ""pawns are the sole of chess"", and ""chess structure is the backbone of your position"". Mr. Soltis shows you the importance of planning ahead and having the right pawn structure, or making your opponent have the wrong one - especially looking toward an endgame. Now this not a book for a beginner, who should be learning basic tactics, traps, ideas behind opening moves and basic endgames. This is a book for someone past that stage that needs to learn the more advanced idea of recognizing how to use pawns and the importance of planning ahead keeping the the pawns (the little people!!) in mind! Don't forget the ""little people"" would be a funny but true statement."
3,Interesting but definitely not for beginners,"He makes some interesting points about the pawn structures resulting from various typical opening systems. However, since you probably only play one or a few of these a lot of the book may not interest you that much, also it is quite advanced and I simply couldnt make sense out of much of it. However, this book is reccomended by many people, including Jeremy Silman in his book Reasess Your Chess. Perhaps if I go over it later I can understand more--definitely not for beginners."
2,Way too advanced for even intermediate players,"The only types of players that this book would benefit are tournament-level, who have memorized all 50 major openings. For the rest of us, the book is a study in arcane gibberish. The only thing I found helpful is how to position the pawns and pieces for a ""break"" into the opponents pawn structure. All other information was confusing. Even after Soltis described ""why"" one player's position won or lost the game, I STILL didn't understand why. The only advice I have for intermediate players is that, if you play black, the most important square to defend is e5. I use a variation of the King's Indian Defence (with Nd7 instead of Nf6), to close the center with black pawns at e5 and d4, then launch a kingside attack. Everyone thinks that getting pieces outside the pawn chain is an advantage, but if you advance pawns wisely, the opponent will be squeezed for space, and control of e5 by black hampers any white kingside attack."
4,A good introduction to pawn structures,"This is a very nice book. Soltis outlines in a very systematic way and in great detail the various plans connected with a given pawn structure. This book is certainly of great value for every intermediate chess player. However, I disliked the choice of games which are given as examples for the various strategies. Usually they are too one-sided, you will hardly get such an easy win in your own games. Some additional examples, where both sides play according to the requirements of the position resulting in a tough struggle, would make this book a five-star book."
2,"Interesting approach, but just another tactical book","You should note immediately that this book is about pawn STRUCTURE, NOT about pawn PLAY. The author classifies the different pawn skeletons typically encountered into similar types or families, and explores the most commonly encountered plans adopted by either side arising from those structures. A good point of the discussion is the lack of connection to specific piece placement. The examples are connected by structure, not by opening variation. Unfortunately the treatment is superficial with limited analysis and vague references to strategic themes that go largely unexplained. Treatment of the Benoni formation is particularly lacking.For insights into pawn PLAY, read the all-time classic, ""Pawn Power in Chess"", by Hans Kmoch."
2,Not enlightening at all. Way overrated.,"I can't understand why so many people praise this book. Sure, Soltis devotes chapters to many different structures, but he doesn't teach us anything in those chapters that a good specialized opening book wouldn't cover. The advice is very basic and the prose he gives is, to me, insufficient.He provides supplemental games that don't always fit well with the content of the chapter, and even if they do the notes to these games are very scant.This same author's Opening Analysis for Advanced Players (I have the 2nd part but have never seen the first part) is EXCELLENT. This one is not.There are a handful of chess authors (chess fans who have been around the game know who I'm referring to) who pump out tons of chess books. 1/3 to 1/2 of them are decent-to-well-done, and the remainder are trash. I wouldn't place this book in the ""trash"" category, but it leaves a lot to be desired."
2,NOT THAT GOOD,Highly over rated . Too much so . This book is not as good as Pawn Power in Chess by Kmoch . Save your money . Buy the book Pawn Power in Chess which is cheaper and way better . The main disadvantage of this book is it deals mainly with openings . Not many concepts are given about pawn play -- mainly how u handle pawn structures in some openings. Your play will suffer if your opponent does not play the openings or if some variations turn up . U will be a sitting duck on the chess board . Get Kmoch's book --- please . U won't be disappointed .
5,Smokin' Joe: The Autobiography of a Heavyweight Champion,"Entertaining and informative biography of the great former heavyweight champion. Joe doesn't pull any punches here, and his anger and disdain for Muhammad Ali is straight forward and sometimes seems somewhat extreme, but Joe makes a great case for his side of the story. If you're a fan of Smokin' Joe, and remember that greatest era of heavyweight boxers, then you'll enjoy Joe's story written in his words and from his viewpoint. Joe tells his life story honestly and with sometimes surprising humor. Well done Joe. Good reading."
3,"Correction to my review, below","I dropped a word in my review, below. The sentence in question should read, ""definitely tells you A few things you didn't know."" Sorry for the mistake, Smokin' Joe! Don't hit me!"
1,A Dreadful tirade!,"This is a truly dreadful book, filled with bitter tirades from Frazier about Muhammad Ali. I could understand if he dealt with this subject in a chapter or so, but GOOD NIGHT! This is simply awful!"
4,STILL SMOKIN'!,"Smokin' Joe give a good history of the game in and out of the ring. The politics in this sport is obvious, and Joe lets the reader in on the grind. From his humble beginnings to his determinatin for a brighter future to finally grasping the prize, his end is bridged by his son, Marvis climb to the title fight. Smokin' Joe deserves high props for eduring when most wouldn't, in and out of the ropes! God Bless the Champ."
3,"Where there's smoke, there's someone Joe Frazier knocked out","SMOKIN' JOE, the autobiography of heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier, has its share of interesting and amusing stories. Its tone is one of getting the job done, not unlike Frazier's boxing style - he would take several punches just to land one, because one Smokin' Joe left hook was all that was necessary to finish the job. SMOKIN' JOE definitely tells you few things you didn't know, but it left me with the feeling that Joe Frazier wasn't saying everything on his mind. Maybe a more assertive editor or co-author would have gotten the quiet fighter to open up a little more."
2,"Basic care yes, training no.","Covers horse health, feeding and care. Description is mis-represented that there is 'training' in this book."
1,Freeze-Fest!! Avoid This Player,"Like two other reviewers, I've run into the freeze issue. I believe it occurs at the layer transition, but am not completely sure. The problem is replicable and does not happen with the same disc on any of my other players, even the Sony NS575P (one lvl down from this...but no optical).So, its time to return this nightmare....please learn from our mistakes."
3,Decent Player.,"i've had this player for a few weeks now. i bought it to replace my older Sony 725 DVD player. i noticed 2 things right away. it takes awhile to read the discs after tray closes. with my 725 player, you can press play as tray was closing and disc would read & play in an instant. i also notice that the picture is slightly darker than my 725. i suggest going into an electronics store and test out the player before buying. for the price though, it's still a good player."
1,must be a joke??,"If anything, these songs are notable for their ***lack*** of guitar. Lots of Hammond B-3 though, if you're into that kind of thing. Altogether, a thoroughly passionless and forgettable effort on all counts."
3,"Good Blues, So-So Jimmy","This is a very nice session of blues, but it doesn't seem to challenge Jimmy very much."
1,not satisfied,This game is texas hold'em poker but it's not well suited for computer play on vista machines. The graphics are good but the game requires that you surrender control of your computer while playing disabling windows.Spend a few more dollars for a more usefull version.
1,Buggy software can't rank hands properly?,See the images that I uploaded showing how I lost a hand with a straight flush to a regular A-high flush using this Texas Hold'Em game by On Hand Software.
4,Flexible and Fast,"I recommend this product. I purchased another game by Simply Media, which was far inferior. I like On Hand's game b/c it provides a lot of variety with limit & no limit games, cash & tournament. It allows significant customization of the games, and it includes a number of interesting scenarios for ""training."" It is also fast."
5,Great book!,"I thought that was an awesome book! I could hardly put it down once I started. If you are wondering, I don't know if we are related."
1,junk!,This fan is not only overpriced but 2 out of the 3 I purchased broke w/in 2 days!Buy the Honeywell instead!
4,memory lane chicano style,"hey ,i can float down in my old rides with pretty girls by my side if i only close my eyes in old cali.i savor every song along with those long ago besos....."
1,Serious flaw,"Almost verything about this is great, I know ur looking at it because of the grid in the lid that keeps very small flat items in place. Well the lid has a grid so that it can be carried or stored vertically. But the latch is terrible, it will not hold, so whats the point of a grid lid if the latch wont keep the lid closed. I bought two of these, its not a defect flaw, its the design. Trust me dont buy these unless u will store them flat and carry them flat."
1,1 big flaw,"This storage case had everything I was looking for: Large size, molded-in divider slots in the lid and bottom, good lid hinge, and enough dividers for the number of slots available. One big problem though, the latch ""hinge"" which is really just a thinned down section of the plastic is very thin, in fact mine arrived already cracked and I had to return it."
3,A Little Piece of Everything,"Scattered Pieces, by Diane M. Marbury and Vivian J. Perry, was an exciting change of pace. Scattered Pieces features twelve short stories, each highlighted with a beautiful piece of poetry at the end. While Marbury crafted stories which danced with a ""new school"" twist, Perry spun stories from an ""old school"" web of wisdom. Each story meshed together to create a book on love and life.Although I found Scattered Pieces to be an enjoyable read, many of the story plots left a little to be desired. Just as I was getting to know certain characters, the story would come to a screeching halt, leaving me with a desire to see more of a resolution. Overall, the stories were well-crafted, but some of them left me with the feeling that the author rushed towards the ending. For the most part, I found each story to be entertaining and the characters to be memorable. If you are a fan of short stories, I recommend you pickup a copy of Scattered Pieces.T. Rhythm KnightAPOOO BookClub"
4,Oracle Certified Professional DBA Practice Exams,"Very well put together. It looks alot like the Oracle8 Certified Professional DBA Exam Guide and works well as a supplement to it. The book is divided into 2 sections, an Exam section and a Terms and Concepts section. Each exam section has 2 tests (i.e. the database administration has Test1 of 60 questions and Test2 of 60 questions). The questions are similar to those in the DBA Exam guide, and others, but different in content. I've gone over the questions in the DBA Exam Guide to where in alot of cases I've memorized the answers. This gives you a new set of questions to work with to identify weaknesses after you've gone over the DBA Exam guide. After taking some of the tests, the Oracle Press books seem to be the way to go. This one's no different."
3,"I loved this one also, but...","Alexander McCall Smith is indeed a masterful writer. I bought & read all seven books in this series, and reading them was always a special treat.Traditional values (hard work, craftsmanship) are stressed, and yet somehow in the midst of this 7th book, I started to see some irony (in the repetition of these values) in that the author seems to be getting a little lazy, repeating himself -- almost as if he copied and pasted passages from earlier books-- over and over.I wish he'd spend less time repeating himself and more developing characters and plots, because there's so much to develop!"
1,great series - lousy book,"i absolutely love the ""No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency"" series, up to this dreadful book. launch yourself without pause or hesitation into the series withThe No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency 5-Book Boxed Setwhich contains in order:""The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency""""Tears of the Giraffe""""Morality for Beautiful Girls""""The Kalahari Typing School for Men""""The Full Cupboard of Life""as to ""Blue Shoes and Happiness"": don't start here, don't end here, don't pause here. the other books were leisurely in a good way, this one is just lame. it spends a lot of time contemplating the heroine's relationship with her figure. it got so i was thinking, if the author writes ""traditional figure"" or even just ""traditional"" one more time, i will scream. i was perpetually looking forward to the latest installment in this series & this one now has me worried that the author is all out of ideas for our detective."
2,"A great series; this one, however, is dull","While I absolutely love this series and all its characters, this Blue Shoes and Happiness tends to ramble on as though meant to simply produce one more book rather than a good book.If you can't get enough of Mma Ramotswe, of course you will read this, but if you are just starting, pick a different one than this."
4,Blue Shoes is a bright spot on a blue day,Once again the #1 Ladies Detective Agency makes an otherwise dismal day alive and hopeful. The detectives bring humor and good old common sense to solve a few of life's daily challenges. Blue Shoes and Happiness: The New Novel in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency Series (No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency)can be a matchmaker or solve a crime with the same penache. Great fun.
4,Another good book in the series...,"Although these books will never end up on a list of significant fiction, as always they are a quick and enjoyable read. This book continues the delightful story of the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency."
5,Another great book in the series,Alexander McCall Smith has done it again- a sweet story with humor! YOu don't have to read all of the books to enjoy a good read.
5,If Only Precious Could Tour America!,"This series gets better with each book; that is saying a lot, because the first one was terrific.The various small mysteries which are solved along the way are fun, but they take a definite back seat to the author's flair for character development.Precious personifies the Proverbs 31 woman, whether Mr. McCall Smith intended that or not, and her depths of compassion and forgiveness are almost super-human. Her meek self-evaluations keep her believable, though, and I admire her very much.Fantastic series; may it never end!"
3,good fun,"This episode develops some of the characters a bit more. Like all the other books in the series, it's a good, relaxing read."
4,Not quite as good as the last one,"When I finished No. 6 in the series, it left me feeling as if I had been hugged by a friend. I felt all warm and cozy. No. 7 (this book) was good but not as great as the last few have been. It is still a good read, just not on par with the others. I'll still be looking forward to the next installment."
2,first book was good - these are quite dull,"The first one or two were good, but there are not many capers anymore. The series is getting dull."
1,Blue Shoes @ Happiness/ full cupboard of Life/company of cheerful ladies,I only want books available on kindle e-book Please inform me when or if these are on kindle J Griffin All the books sound like what I would like to read but due to age and RA regular books are becomming harder to old without bending the books and taking the chance of breaking the binding Thank You Hope you get these someday
3,love this stuff!,"Yet another in a series of insanely addictive Mma Ramotswe novels! I simply go nuts waiting for each new book to come out.This particular installment is funny and engrossing. I wouldn't say it is as good as a couple of its predecessors (less compelling mysteries, too quickly wrapped up side-stories), but...who cares?! We get all the characters we love, and the personal side stories continue to keep you reading.Keep it up, Alex!"
5,Blue Shoes and Happiness,Blue Shoes and Happiness is another great addition to the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. This is a simple sweet story. Characters are not multi layered. My only complaint is that the book is over so quickly.
2,?,"I don't know why - but this novel read like a report on the effects of fertilizer 24 hours after being planted. This was my first try at Alexander McCall Smith and I don't think I will revisit this mockery of detective fiction again. The only reason I am giving this book two stars and not one (for the failed plot, or lack thereof) is because Mr. Smith is a fantastic writer, all he needs is fresh characters and plots that progress."
3,"A ""different"" kind of detective novel, alright!","It's a mild sort of book, rambling along on a sunny, slow African day. Though you get a few glimpses of that leisurely Africa (Botswana) that the author wants to portray, its moral high ground is off-putting.The style is a little too contrived in its quaintness. Also the lack of intensity in the prose, makes this style somewhat boring for me. For a detective novel, the pace is too slow. It can possibly grow on you, but that hasn't happened to me yet - this is my second Mma Ramotswe book, the first one being ""In the Company of Cheerful Ladies"".I see a lot of other reviews here finding the characters delightful, so I must be missing something. But I could not particularly relate to or even like any of the characters.It's not the sort of book I'd prefer to buy or take on a travel, but if it's lying around, I can pick it up and read to the finish."
3,The author needs to improve the wit and satire.,"Having enjoyed this series when I was much younger but not having read the last 40 or so installments, I was eager to reacquaint myself with the world of Sinanju. I was both pleased and disappointed. I was pleased to find Remo and Chiun bantering as always amid self-absorbed parodies of national political and cultural figures, but I was disappointed that the satire was not fresher and more pointed. I think the author needs to take a more sophisticated approach to the core material, understanding that the audience over the last 15 years has been exposed to modern-day events that are often more absurd than the best Destroyer parodies."
4,"better, but a ways to go","Ok, OK, OK. I guess this book is better than the last few, but I am still tired of finding inconsistencies in the books. Whomever Gold Eagle gets to write these books should not be allowed near a typwriter or word processor until they have read at least the first 100 books in the series so they have a clue about what is going on. I have not completed with the book, but over all I like it. The banter between Chiun and Remo has improved, but Smith isn't himself, Remo isn't himself, the writer thinks Chiun is the Master of Sinanju (and Remo isn't) rather than the reigning Master.... I could compile a list here, but why bother -- you'll see them for yourself."
3,the house is pleased,"LO The pale piece of pigs ear that has chronicled the movements of the house of Sinanju, Has suffered the death of 1000 broken bones. The new writers beware of the night tigers in the shadows and keep the stories on track lest they suffer the same fate. Chuin the wise"
4,great product bad packaging,received this product with some knicks a scratches. The box was torn and damaged and was too large for the intended use. I wich they had some formed styrofoam to help with the packing. This product is heavy and should have been packed heavily
3,Combines practical metrics and academic theory,"Research findings in the field of software measurement are thoroughly reviewed. Both traditional and object-oriented product metrics are examined. Methods for determining the mathematical validity of metrics area assessed in the chapter on ""A Rigorous Approach to Metrics"". Intriguing presentation of cognitive complexity models including an analysis of programming tasks, code chunks, and code landscape."
5,A very nice book for every computer student and professional,"I bought this book as a gift for one of my best friends, he was making his thesis about mashups in Computer Engineering and he just loved it. Is a really good book if you wanna know everything about your system and how the metrics can be tested. A nice book. The shipping was fast and the book was in perfect conditions. Thanks"
4,Same as simply titled 'Horrid Henry' - EXACTLY the same!,"Don't do what I did. Don't fall in love with Horrid Henry books and expect THIS one to be anything new. This was released in 1995 with this cover, and then again in 2009 with a blue cover and Henry wearing a pirate hat. It is exactly the same book, word for word. I was thrown by the words 'and Other Stories' - there are NO new stories in here. Buy the newer one unless you're a collector and simply must have every single edition of the Horrid Henry series!"
4,A treadmill to nothingness? Haunting Beckett ghost story,"Despite its mathematically precise stage directions (there's even a diagram), pinning down the dramatic events, 'Footfalls' is ultimately as elusive as its heroine, pacing endlessly up and down a strip of light, tending to her sick mother. The pacing is interrupted by two monologues which may, or may not, tell the story of May's life - it is typical in a play with a literally self-effacing heroine that her story should haunt others' stories, that others should speak for her, that the imagery should be ghost-like, inchoate, tantalising; one voice doubled, splintered. Her mother is a mere voice; by the end of the play, May is on her way - is this the natural fate of women for Beckett?It goes without saying that such a visually precise play doesn't read very well, although there is an accumulation of words and feelings that is tremendously powerful."
2,arrived broken,"Ordered eight, and while packed in a lot of bubble paper, two arrived quite broken. This may not be a best product to order by mail."
2,Leaves a gap at top of Radio,"Installed it fits in dash and holds radio properly. However, it leaves 3/4 inch gap above the radio and this is because it was made to fit in a bunch of vehicles ranging from the Mustang to Explorer to the Expedition and a few of Ford's other brands. Its not attaptable to put the gap at the bottom or comes with an extra filler panel. Thus, my two stars"
4,Could have been 5,"I really liked this story, loved Johnny. The bad boy (or not good enough boy) storyline gets me every time, and when its two people who loved each other when they were young makes it even better. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 was that I would have liked to have seen alot more glimpses into their past together. The only one we get to see is when they first begin talking to each other. I wanted a little more than that, such as their first 'time' together and so on...Johnny is wonderful. Rebecca Brandewynne did a good job of retelling the past in her book Dust Devil. Similar storyline."
1,No Way!,I just don't get it. I can't understand what all the hype was about this book. I found it be quite unbelievable at best. The character of Leah was boring. Johnny wasn't too bad. I just found his model /movie star status a bit hard to swallow. The story just wasn't well developed. I found it boring and because of this I just couldn't believe all the things that took place. I would've preferred reading more about them in their teenage years. I guess it was just hard for me because once you start reading the story the love is alredy there betweenthem. All in all it was a big disappointment.
2,"Hackneyed plot, trite characters...","The poor, hardworking heroine w/ the handicapped son, the BigSexy Movie Star boyfriend whom Leah dithers about marrying(yeah,sure, who wants to be rich and happy? Not her!)the always-supportive sidekick black nurse/housemaid...the cruel father, the dead mother, the evil Hollywood agents, the pitiable sick boy...come on. Nothing in the book is believable or original."
4,Good but no surprises,"When I read Green's book, I was startled to realized that I could predict what was going to happen next. It was one of those bad guy/good guy books that have not a whole lot new to offer. Except the ending. I wouldn't have guessed it in a million years. It's worth reading just for that."
2,rechargeable electric razor,My husband bought this and after a month of using determiend it is only good for him as a between shave razor.
5,shocking,"Very good service, everything arrived on time and intact. One of the boots was really smashed up, didn't even want to use it but i put it in the microwave and it came out nice and round. Good price and will use them again."
1,Very Bad Game - Stay Away From It - Waste of Time and Money,"This is a very bad desined game.Units not reacting to commands.Units taking fire and not returning fire.Production of units is too slow.Resource gathering is too slow.Units sometimes don't get created for no reason, they just sit in the queue, stuck in there.AI on easy is too hard to beat, even with cheat codes.The game may look nice but it is unplayable.Save your money for another game.Rise of Legends is one of the best RTS game around, try it instead."
2,"Not the worst, could have been the best.","It has a fun campaign, the graphics are really amazing. Skimish gets boring quick. Online play, leaves alot to be desired. YOu wont be able to play unless you have the same version as other people, and thier are many version floating around, and nobody seems to be using the version supported by the developers. I would not recommend buying this game if you are into online play. Otherwise, a good game"
4,Still playing years later,I have enjoyed this game because it allows you to build different structures and different vehichles. I bought Earth 2150 and found the graphics to be so poor I quickly lost interest. I am anxious to see if Earth 2170 comes along...
4,"Nice additions, small annoyances","Earth 2160 picks up shortly after Earth 2150. Humanity has been evacuated to Mars with the Earth no longer being inhabitable. The game has excellent graphics for the buildings, vehicles and landscape. People are done well but facial expressions leave something to be desired. Unlike the other Earth games, 2160 has voice actors and animated mission briefings. The voice actors are a very welcome addition. The interface looks pretty, though I miss the different tactics you could use for units in the other games. Also it can be difficult to manage large selections of units. Four different factions have 7 missions each. More missions would have been nice but the existing ones tell the story well enough. Three factions play similarly, but the fourth is very different and refreshing. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it as a solid game with some nice additions."
3,softwalk clogs,"Very cute shoes. I get many compliments on them. I wear them for work, and at the end of the day my left foot is in pain. I got medium, but I should have gotten wide in these shoes."
3,It was a horrid experience!,"I bought the shoes on July 1st and returned them a week laterand two nervous emails (wondering if they even got them)..I onlyreceived some sort of ""stock"" reply for me to wait until a laterdate.....It is now Sept 5th....I actually got the refund..With a$19.95 restocking fee....I do NOT recommend this store!!!"
2,Look great but feel bad,"These shoes certainly are beautiful, but they aren't very comfortable, at least not for me. When I first tried them on, even though the egg crate foot bed was cushy but my foot just felt smothered and like it couldn't breath. The shoes felt a bit too crowded, and yet the heel was sliding off every time I took a step. I hoped it would go away but it just got worse. By the end of the day my feet were sweating (and thats very unusual for me) the outer sides of my feet both hurt significantly, enough that I knew I would have to return them. I had ordered an 8.5 wide size because I had a sneaking suspicion that they would feel narrower than most shoes, from all the cushioning. And I do have feet that are slightly wider than most. (this was the first pair of Wide shoes I've ever ordered - I wear normal shoes all the time without any discomfort) I bought the open backed soft walk shoes instead and they are much more comfortable no pain at all."
5,So creative and unique -- parents and children will love it!,"I initially borrowed this book and CD set from the library on a whim because the cover looked interesting. Two renews later, I am purchasing one for the house. I have a 2 and 3 year old who listen to this CD non-stop. My 3 year old knows all the words, and I must confess I DO TO. The songs are so creative and catchy -- you will find yourself humming along with the alligators. This is certainly a smart collection of songs that will introduce your little one to various styles of music. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!"
2,Boring,"The book came without the CD of the music, so I cannot say if it would have been transformed by the songs, which get so much praise in the other reviews. The story by itself, though, was pointless and boring, and I don't think it could possibly hold the interest of a child at any age. I sent it back because it was missing the CD, but having read it, I didn't care to get the complete package."
3,Modernism vs. Modernism in Art,"Gablik makes good points but needs an editor badly, as well as distinguishing from Early Modernism, Greenbergism, and Late Modernism. She simply throws the blanket term Modernism out far too much, and if you have read any philosophy about Modern Thought, well then you might be doing a double take here and there. In general though, it is useful, to introduce problems in the art world, while a little bit dated it is still relevant."
1,Sloppy work by amazon (not the first - not the last),"Amazon doesn't check all the details of its merchandise. This book is 133 pages at last check - not 160 pages as stated in Amazon's product specifications. Sloppy, lazy work for a legitimate peddler."
1,Warning - False Advertising!!,The picture and title says 90 minute tape - but the description says 60 minute tape!! No wonder the price is so cheap - you were warned
2,Unwilling Pooch,My dog would not get into the bed. The bed would also not stay upright so everytime I put him into the bed it rolled over which freaked him out more. This seemed like such a great idea especially since I have a dog who loves to burrow. Unfortunately it turned out to be a disappointing waste of money.
1,small size is non-functional,"the small size has the bed surface touching the top, there is no cavity for the dog unless the dog knew to push its way into the bed. My dogs won't go in the bed for this reasonJRF"
2,"Nice idea, I thought, but my dog doesn't","I really thought my dog would like a bed like this. It seems like a good idea: so cozy. However, she won't sleep in it. I have no idea why not. I actually think it's the cushion she doesn't like."
3,Snoozer bed,I like the bed but my dog not so much although he likes to be under cover. He was afraid of it at first and I thought about sending back. After contacting seller decided to keep as would not be worth returning.( Better to have someting than be out money and have nothing) The seller charges restocking fee and S/H is not refunded. I would recommend buying only if you are 100% sure your pet would like bed.
5,Love It,"As soon as I took it out of the box, my 16 lb dachshund mix jumped right in and made himself at home. I bought this in hopes to ween him off burrowing in my bed at night, but unfortunately he rarely goes in the cave to sleep at bedtime. It's his daytime home, and it's great quality and plenty spacious for him. My friend with a larger dog (catahoula hunting dog) recommended it to me since she has one for her dog and she absolutely swears by it. They really are cool beds and everyone who sees him in it oohs and ahhs at how adorable he looks going inside his little cozy home."
4,Cozy Cave Dog Bed,"Purchased this for my Mini Pin. Very well made. Quick shipping. A little too much stuffing, but you can take some out. Wish it was a little lower to the floor, it is a little difficult for the dog to get on. Looks like it is going to topple over when dog is on one side."
5,Safe From Drafts,"My little guy (5.5 pounds) has three beds, and this is his favorite by far. He loves to burrow into it, and the internal wire keeps the hood up so he can peek outside. The small size would probably fit two 5 lb dogs, and would be fine for one 10 to 15 pound dog. My house is drafty, and I'm happy that this bed will keep him warm--it's like a sleeping bag with sherpa lining. This product is a little pricey compared to others, but it's worth the cost."
4,My doxie loves it,The only complaint I have about this bed is that it tilts off to the side . If the cushion could somehow be made more stable so that it didn't roll around so easily when the dog is in the bed it would be perfect for your little burrowing pup. The bed cover washes well and it is easy to take on and off.
1,Too small and unstable for any but tiny toy dogs.,"I have a 25lb burrowing dog who wouldn't go inside this bed and for good reason. The one time I was able to bribe him inside, he had to worm-squirm to the back (no headroom) then the thing tipped over on him when he finally made it all the way inside.Took my tape measure out and found the bed is barely 23"" in diameter and that is when bed is flattened to the floor after the top has been removed. With the top on, the diameter is only 21"". The materials are pretty flimsy, and I see after 5 minutes of dragging the bed sans roof around, my basenji has torn it open and is proceeding to empty it's contents."
5,"A must have, I can sleep again!","I must admit I purchased the Snoozer Cozy Cave more with myself in mind than our dog. My hope was that our Fox Terrier would quit sneaking into bed and under the covers so I could get a good nights sleep. I've tried sweaters, doggie pajamas and blankets but nothing worked. My package arrived last night, I took it out of the box and put it on the couch, before I could look at it she zoomed and dove right in!!! All I can say is WOW and thank you so much for restoring my sleep. When we went to bed on Christmas Eve she went right into her SCC with her blanket and she was still there when we woke up this morning!!! Success and Merry Christmas to us!!! Our Cavalier also tried to get in but she defended her bed, he went to his own bed like the good boy he is. I might have to buy another one for him too."
1,"Seller, Please change your Ad - Item is NOT as pictured","Sorbie ""Cleane"" for Normal Hair pictured (black bottle), but was sent ""Cleane for Chemically Treated Hair"" (white bottle). I wouldn't have purchased this if I knew it was Sorbie's shampoo for chemically treated hair. I much prefer the shampoo for normal hair by Sorbie - it cleans much better and leaves my hair shiny and manageable."
5,Definitive Performance,"Back in 1974(when this series of performances were recorded at the London Coliseum)I attended as many as I could and found that Mr. Goodall managed to obtain performances of rare power and authority.He was already 74 years old at the time(he died in 1990)and was a very shy man but put him in a pit with a Wagner score and he became a magician.He spent years before performances coaching his singers and the orchestra so that they fully learned their parts and understood what was required. Norman Bailey - a great Wotan,Rita Hunter sweet of voice,Alberto Remedios a superb heldentenor,along with the whole cast who perform well.If you want a Ring that gets to the heart of Wagner this is the one to buy!"
4,Wonderful performance...,I have written elsewhere of my appreciation for these performances. What I don't understand is why anyone would pay over $200 for something that can be downloaded on good MP3 for about 1/3 of the price.
1,An atrociously stupid non-performance.,"Goodall's ""interpretation"" of Wagner consists of playing almost everything verrrryyyy slowwwwlllly. (Or should I say ""vehwy swowy""?) That's it. Literally.These performances are indescribable because there is nothing _to_ describe. There is no ""insight"" into the music -- either inspired or misguided. If you programmed a synthesizer to simply play the notes at a very slow tempo, without any sort of phrasing or inflection, you would have a ""performance"" indistinguishable from the Goodall.If you have nothing better to do with your time than waste it listening to pointless, meaningless ""music-making,"" or you enjoy staring at a blank wall, you will no doubt enjoy the Goodall Ring. If you believe your time should be more-profitably spent, there are more-entertaining, more-stimulating versions available.As Gertrude Stein said about Oakland -- ""There's no _there_ there."""
3,A dissenting opinion,"This is certainly a lovely book, but I don't completely agree with the other reviews. Although the renderings are beautifully detailed, the vast majority are two-dimensional profiles; I found very little of anything else. If you have a fair amount of discretionary cash, it may be worth the full price. I have books that are as good that I've paid half as much for (used for $23); but, I can't say I regret the purchase (well maybe a little). The major faults are the number of flat side views (for all the lovely detail, most of the plates are very much the same) and lack of depth in the text (for a book that lists for $120). It may delight someone as a gift. The seller was very straight-forward about the minor defect."
5,A true account of the inhumanity of war,"I knew Dr. Bardach from my residency training at the University of Iowa. I am sad to say I never read this book until now. He never spoke of this personal nightmare to his trainees, but reading this book helped me understand him so much better. He was a caring surgeon beyond all others I knew. After reading this book, I now know why. I literally could not put this book down. It was a real account of the terror of war and the extent of human suffering that shapes one's soul. It makes one truly fear the realities of war but gives one hope for continued life. Bravo Janusz, for bearing your innermost thoughts from the darkest period in your (anyone's) life. I wish I could have thanked you personally."
5,A good story.,"The author Janusz Bardach plainly is someone who never grew old. Even as he wrote this account in mature years, his experiences were etched so deeply that nothing could remove his young man's point of view. That impression upon the reader, along with Bardach's characteristic way of taking something reinforcing from most every chance event, present him as a very fine and even unique personality."
5,Outstanding Narrative of Human Survival with a Twist,"What a great story. I couldn't put the book down. It is a view of WW II and Soviet Terror told from a unique perspective. I was enthralled to read the first hand accurate descriptions of human suffering and maladies. Then to my suprise the Author revealed himself to be one of my professors during Medical School! He never talked about this part of his life during my brief and peripheral association with him, and was a hard but just teacher with glimpses of remarkable human tenderness.The first hand description of vitamin deficiencies was insightful.Buy this book and read about human courage and survival"
4,One Man's Tale Reminds Us Of The Millions Who Died Unknown,"We have read about the millions who suffered, died and were forgotten, and sometimes the sheer number numbs us to their suffering. Yet here, one man steps forward, like Ivan Denisovich, and tells us his story, and makes it all real again. Dr. Bardach has been able to convey a difficult, sad, tragic experience into a eminently readable account that does not leave one depressed by its witnessing of the dark angels of our nature, but treasure the ability of hope and humanity to struggle on and find something to strive for against all hope."
2,"Broke after 8 months, had to replace","Well, I bought this particular DVD player, and loved it for about...8 months. Then, it wouldn't recognize any disks that were placed in it. I brought it in for repair, figuring if its cheap, i'll just get it fixed, since I liked it. Turned out the ""laser assembly"" had failed, according to the technician. It would be more expensive to repair than to replace, so I tossed it, and bought a different model from Phillips"
3,Uncomfortable but effective,"My ears really don't like these. For the price they are very functional, but I couldn't wear these all day non-stop."
1,The worst GPS on the market,I have a 550 and have had nothing but problems. Sent back to Navman after 6 mos. of very light use because the touch screen stopped working. They took 6 weeks to fix it. Now trying to buy updated maps for US and told Navman does not support map updates for this product anymore. What a joke.
4,The Louis L'Amour Companion,I found this book entertaining and informative. I have just begun to scratch the surface of quality westerns and this book allows some insite to one of the genre's best writers. If you do like Louis L'Amour and want to understand the background concerning this man... don't pass this up.
2,Not for fans,"This book might be useful if you want to know the chronology of L'Amour's works, but it offers very little else for readers who are familiar with his books. The author's opinions about the value of particular stories might lead you to skip some very enjoyable reading. If you have read L'Amour and like his work, skip this book."
5,bubble fun!,My 2yr old daughter loves this toy! and it blows bubbles out faster then I ever could. It has wands close together so there is always bubbles blowing (other machines don't) it is easy to take a part to clean. It is also easy to fill. this is a great buy! it will save you from endless bubble blowing.
4,best bubble juice on the market,"We have tried them all...have a 2 year old that just loves bubbles. The wand in this doesn't work good for just regular bubbles (it's for huge ones), but we just use the juice out of it and pour it in little containers that are his size and easy for him to use. You can blow dozens of bubbles with one dip...it's thicker than regular bubble juice."
5,"Bubbles, Bubbles and MORE Bubbles",My son (heck my whole FAMILY) LOVE these bubbles!!! If you can find a product that gives you more bubbles with this little effort than you have a winner on your hands.Until then these are simply THE BEST bubbles you can buy!!!!!
1,No Bubbles,Apparently I got a bad bottle of bubbles. One little blow with maybe 3 or 4 bubbles is all my granddaugher could get out of a wand. She never did get a big bubble to blow. We put the solution in the no spillable bucket thinking maybe this would work better. Some of the time she could blow 1 or 2 bubbles and often no bubbles at all just the drip off the wand. She was a very disappointed girl.
5,Ornithological Explorations of New Guinea,"In this book one of the leading experts on the birds of New Guinea shares some of his experiences on this fascinating island with the readers.Similarly to Flannery'sThrowim' Way Leg, most of the field trips described took place in Papua New Guinea, where highlands, lowlands and off-shore islands were all visited.In one chapter, the author ventures across the border to Indonesian West Papua, where he visited the central highlands.Not just a mere personal account, the text is full of information about the ecology and fauna (especially birdlife) of this unique land.I have had the fortune to be able to visit New Guinea repeatedly myself, but reading this book made me want to return there ASAP!"
4,A very good value,"I decided to try these toner cartridges because of the very low price. I had read some of the reviews here about the printer not recognizing these cartridges, and I was expecting to have to do some reconfiguring if necessary to make them work. I must say I was pleasantly surprised when my C5200 had no problem at all with them. The colors are even and bright, and the only negative I found is that they only seem to last about 75-80% as long as the OKI originals. But usage is difficult to accurately measure because of varying printing requirements. Considering the price, they have been a very good value for me. I will buy them again."
3,DID NOT WORK FOR ME,I'M GIVING THIS A 3 STAR ONLY BECAUSETHEY REFUNDED AS PROMISED.IT WAS VERIFIED THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE WORKED.KEPT GETTING SENSOR ERROR AND MY OKI C5100 PRINTER SIMPLY STOPPEDI DID FIND IT A BIT DIFFICULT TO FIND HOW TO CONTACT THE COMPANY.THE PRICE FOR THE FOUR TONERS WAS VERY GOOD BUT JUST WOULDN'T WORK.I DID READ GLOWING REVIEWS WHICH MADE ME THINK THEY WOULD WORK.
3,"Good price, but not as high a quality replacement as OKI original","These non OEM cartridges work ok, but if you want the sheen of the ink like on business card or on a good flyer the stick to OKI original cartridges!"
3,doesn't last as long,"I printed 960 sheets of full color and I was already running low and getting warnings from my OKI. affordable, but you get what you pay for."
5,Works Great!,"Much cheaper than Okidata toner, works great. I have reordered this product several times. I have had one bad toner cartridge, but the shipper replaced it very quickly."
3,ok but black does not work that great,black is not working correctly. other colors are ok. not sure how the originals would differ. but black i would return
4,Confusing situation regarding CDs,"The image shown on Amazon indicates on the CD cover that it is the Orignal Score from the movie. Yet, the item I received from a seller shows the same cover art (on the beach), but the actual contents and even the wording on the cover are ""music from and inspired by the motion picture"" which obviously is not the original score.Not quite sure who is to blame for this mix-up. It may be simply a packaging problem. However, I do like this CD, but love more the movie score. I'll be sure to contact a seller before trying to purchase this item again to ensure it is the score and not music inspired by the movie."
5,Reaches into the depths of the soul......,Words are inadequate..only the soul and the fire within the heart can express how really lovely this music portrays what it is truly important in life: being lost and being found again...and being loved without boundaries.
5,Reaches into the depths of the soul......,Words are inadequate..only the soul and the fire within the heart can express how really lovely this music portrays what it is truly important in life: being lost and being found again...and being loved without boundaries.Yared never fails!
5,Music to sooth the soul and lift the spirit...,"One of the most moving and beautiful music written for a movie. Gabriel Yared, who also composed the score for City of Angels has created another collection of music that is soothing, uplifting, and touching. Every note speaks to the listener in the most emotional ways."
5,The best iron that I've ever had,"This was the best iron that I've ever used. It was well worth my money. I owned it for two years before the cord got a shortage in it. This iron was very easy to use, heated up really quickly, and ironed our clothes perfectly. It never leaked one single time during the entire 2 years. It's not too heavy or bulky. You can quickly and smoothly iron your clothes."
5,Great marinade,I really liked this. I am on a low sodium diet and this marinade worked like a charm and made the chicken tasty.
4,"Simple ""Shimmery"" Elegance",My daughters loved this as a present for Christmas---it is for everyday wear as well as special times.
4,Vertigo Deluxe - Loving It!,"This CD is spinning in my computer at work 24/7...oops, I mean 8/6! Perfect mix of hip & kickback grooves. Seriously great album."
5,Good!,"Bought these and they worked great with my Digitech delay, reverb, chorus and Jaman. No noticeable noise added to my ears. They continue to work to this day. They are built tough enough for moderate use and do the job for cheap. GOOD VALUE!"
3,Hosa Jumper Cable for Pedal Effects (6 Inch) (6 Pack),"they do the trick for the money. it seems the molded ends could be more solid to the cable. i have better ones, but they work."
2,Don't waste your time,"These used to be the standard, but of the 3 packs I've bought this year only a handful still work. They come apart, leaving the tips inside my pedals' jacks. This requires disassembly of the pedal, sometimes replacement of the jack, to fix. I am not rough with my gear and my pedals sit in one spot. On some of them the tips will easily pull off by hand. I say go with the nicer Hosas with the all metal jacks if you know they'll fit your pedals, otherwise find another brand... these were once good and cheap, now they're just cheap."
3,Does the trick,"These cables will hold you over until you can buy nicer patch cables. And I 100% recommend buying nicer cables. You'll spend more, but you'll notice a quality difference a few years down the road when the 6 for $10 Hosa cables you bought are all shorted out and your other cables are still running strong. I'd recommend George L cables if you can afford to drop the cash. If not, check out the Planet Waves pedal board kit.I would only buy these if you are a new beginner with one or two pedals or if you just need something to hold you over for a few months until you can buy something better."
3,Exactly as expected,"I bought these on impulse while checking out with a pedal tuner on amazon. I've used Hosa cables before and know exactly what to expect: standard cables, molded connectors, solid quality but not spectacular. I got what I expected.I'll probably buy some more ends for my pedalboard eventually, but since I'm not made of money, these will have to fill the holes in my signal chain. They don't sound bad, and I am not in a huge hurry to replace them. For the price, I really can't knock these cables."
4,"works fine, inexpensive","Not much to say about patches...they haven't given me ANY trouble, which is as good as it gets with cables!"
5,Masterful collection of a master.,"This book is a collection of Emanuel Tov's essays on the Septuagint. The collection displays remarkable breadth, as well as methodological rigour, making the end product an indespensible tool for anyone wishing to seriously study the Septuagint."
2,Just for the collector,"This is a collections of tracks recorded mostly of Eric Clapton, and if I remember the original liner notes along with Jimmy Page with a few cuts featuring Jeff Beck. (Beck sounds the most proficiant to me) A friend of mine had this album (or at least an album with some of this material on it) back in 1973. I believe it was called Guitar Boogie. It's very dated sounded with a few of the tracks just having 2 guitars (Eric on lead and Jimmy on chords I think)and sounds like they had a small reel to reel sitting around someone's house in an informal jam. I bought it just for the memories, a little bit of the earlier jamming by Eric, Jeff & Jimmy. I believe this was probably around the time of the Yardbirds, or shortly after Beck split from them, around those years. I would only recommend this for those searching out everything these guys have done. But there are some good moments on there. A few tracks have vocals in what sounds like sessions one of them were playing on."
4,"A good book, though need to be updated","This book has long been in my wishing list. As many others here, I hope a new version that agree with the latest codes could come up. However, I finally decided to buy it. They sent the book quickly and immaculately new. I like it."
5,Needs more animal pictures,I give it 1 star for having a 5000:1 text to picture ratio... but 10 stars for helping us determine that a tornado can not flip an M1 Abrams tank.
5,Parson's Chairs,"These chairs were well packaged and arrived without a scratch. They are extremely comfortable and attractive, especially for the price. Unfortunately, one of the chairs arrived with two left front legs, rather than a right and a left. As of this moment, I'm waiting to hear back from customer service to resolve the problem. If they simply send me a pair of new matching legs, in trade for the two lefts I have, I won't hesitate to order from this company again. I'm very pleased with the quality of the items I received (aside from the one packing glitch)."
3,disappointed in quality,"the chairs look great but are not the greatest quality. You definately get what you pay for and in this case, you are paying little. The chairs are very light and there is no support on the seats for heavier people. If you are petite and don't mind chairs that are average at best, these are for you. If you want a heavy duty that will last for many years to come, these are not those chairs."
2,Too much tofu,"I returned this cookbook after looking through it. I'd been hoping for recipes that use combinations of natural ingredients to make a complete protein, such as corn and beans. I do not cook with tempeh or tofu; I use milk, eggs, and butter, but am leaning towards a vegetarian, not vegan diet. My favorite meatless cookbook is Meatless Meals in Twenty Minutes by Karen Levin."
5,An excellent cookbook full of delicious recipes,"I checked out this cookbook from the library and as soon as I cracked it open I knew I needed a copy of my own. It is full of simple, tasty, and easy to prepare recipes. I really like how most of the recipes don't require many special ingredients and how simple the directions are. I was a little apprehensive having made the decision to become a vegetarian but this cookbook gave me confidence I'd still be able to enjoy a flavorful variety of cuisine."
5,Don't judge this book by its cover.,"I received this cookbook from a family friend years ago when I was a freshman in high school. I remember thinking pfft teen? Please, I'm practically an adult and didn't even bother to open it... Boy, did I miss out!!! When I looked through it years later, I wanted to kick myself. This cookbook is not only full of easy and delicious recipes, but also tips and advice on being a vegetarian, like what to snack on. The tempeh bacon is my favorite recipe hands down. I've made this countless times. Awesome! The curried tempeh and sesame tofu triangles are also wonderful.I'm 23 years old, way past my teens and this is one of the books I go to most. In fact, a few of the pages are getting quite messy with grease stains and whatnot..Please, treat yourself and get this so you can fall in love with these simple and tasty recipes!!!"
3,So so Recipes,"Nothing new here. It's a good book if neither teen nor parent can cook but if they have eaten anything prepared at home (and seen it done) they can probably skip this book. The recipes are very simple. Nothing new, nothing exciting. I didn't find any of the recipes that great. My girls will use it to make a few meals for themselves (I am teaching them to cook) but I do feel that a copy of Vegetarian Times would have been a better choice. The offerings in this book are mostly pasta and faux-Mexican meals. I am not sure that anyone needs a book to teach them how to produce either?"
5,totally practical,"Everything in this cookbook is easy, practical, good, and creative. It gives helpful tips, and a big variety of vegetarian recipes. The recipes also appeal to my non- vegetarian family. This is definetly my favorite cookbook."
2,"Well, it's flexible!","The Gorillapod is very handy and is the right size to pack in your bag. You have to be careful though about what size lens you have on your camera before using it, it's not very stable. You also have to find the right type of surface for it to rest on, such as a flat table top or some rocks. You also have to be careful about what you wrap it around for higher up work. It grips, but not well. I would recommend the product for a point and shoot or a light camera with a smaller lens, but not for a serious kit."
3,Meh,"I love Moon's fantasy series, but the space opera books I find somewhat lacking. Can't really put a finger on it per se, but in general, the language is a bit stilted, the characters are not quite as interesting, but, perhaps, most importantly, what's missing is the author's passion for the work. It's just meh. OK when there is nothing better to read - that is, not too boring and not irritating."
5,fan,This a great story. A good addition to my collection of her work. The book it self i in better condition than expected. the cost made it a great deal.
4,Best of the four,"It's nice to see this series kick into high gear. Ky's finally gotten over herself and has taken charge of a small fleet. Rafe has gone from irritating pretty boy, to a man who is fair and level headed. The stupid stuff with kids and dogs has gone away, leaving a good story about standing up to a bunch of pirates and getting ready to take back what's been stolen. It's a pity that it takes three other volumes to get to this point."
4,space epic,"The first thing you need to do is get a hold of the other three books of the Vatta's War series. They are fast moving and full of excitement throughout the series. There are space battles, spies, other people who do not like what is going on, murderers and a lot of plots and some of those in your own family. If you like SF and space travel, and are looking for something exciting... you should give this series a try. You may be more than entertained; you may have a great time... of course that is up to you.Anna del C.Author of ""The Elf and the Princess""The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"
4,Command Decision a pleasant Saturday afternoon read,"Command Decision (Vatta's War Series) is a ripping good yarn. The story is nicely paced with many realistic touches that deal with the trails of trying to sustain both military and business operations. I would recommend this book to any avid science fiction reader and especially those that are space opera fans.However, I do have three small criticisms of this book. First, the book is not as much a stand alone work as Ms. Moon's previous works in this series; you should read the previous works to fully appreciate this book. Second, I felt it the ending was a bit contrived and hurried in its development - although I found the ending very enjoyable. Third and foremost, I felt that Ms. Moon has far too many characters that each deserve their own separate stories rather than rolled up into one book.Again this is a very entertaining story, that is part of a very addictive series, and is a top notch read."
3,"Wooden action, wooden characters, wooden villains. Disappointing.","In a word, disappointing, especially since her last,Engaging the Enemy(see my review there), was so good.Full of wooden action, wooden characters, wooden villains. And largechunks of it depend on characters being blind to the obvious. Mind, Ifinished the thing, and will (probably) read the next, but Moon may berunning low on ideas for this open-ended series.Your mileage may vary. Sherwood Smith liked it a lot more than I did:""She gives us a cast of complex, interesting people as they cope with,and learn from, experience. I found it almost impossible to put thisbook down... "" [google for her review at SF Site]Heh. I had no trouble whatever putting it down....Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"
3,Good starter stamp kit,"I liked the pictures and reviews of this stamp set plus I like M&D stuff. My small children enjoy this. The pictures are perfect for their age and they have fun with the color assortment. My problem with the set is that it isn't durable (especially if you let little kids use them). After only a couple of sessions of stamping, the stamps look like they're already wearing off the wood. The ink on the pads was weak, the pictures came out light, even when I was stamping. I still like this set but don't think it's high-quality M&D and wish it didn't have their logo on it."
3,Cute stamps but came with dried up ink,"The ink was pretty dried up upon arrival. It was surprising because the ink pads have a plastic lid. The stamps are cute, though, and a good size for little toddler hands. We'll be keeping the stamps but looking for different ink pads."
4,Cute but should have a lid,"My 5 year old was so excited to receive this as a gift and loves the different images on the stamps and multi-color inkpad. However, I wish there were a lid on the case to keep the stamps from falling out. It needs to be stored flat, which is not always practical for a child cleaning up art supplies. Otherwise, the stamps are well-made and sturdy."
3,So much potential...,"I was really excited about this, because my daughter loves making projects with paper, scissors, markers, etc. So I thought adding stamps would be super exciting for her. It wasn't, but it was mostly because the ink pad is mostly dried out. I'll have to go to a craft store and get one so she can use this. The stamps are cute, though."
3,"Cute idea, but the ink pad needs work","My twin girls, 3, loved these stamps but they had a hard time getting enough ink on the stamps. It was almost as if the ink pad had dried out or something, but the package came completely sealed. I will buy other ink pads, and I am sure the girls will continue to use the stamps."
4,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Happy Handle stamp set,"I purchased this set for a 2 year old. He understands how to ink the stamp pad and is able to press down on paper so that he gets an image. The handles are a convenient size for his hands. He enjoys using the stamp set when he's being creative and though he doesn't use it daily, it seems to be durable for his needs. It would be nice if they could design a similar stamp set with pictures that boys prefer. I think he would play with it more if it had less hearts, flowers, lips and butterflies."
3,Make them Self-Inking,"I love the fact that these stamps have a handle, as so many wooden stamps do not. However, it would be much better if they were also self-inking. I bought this set after searching high and low for ""fun"" self-inking stamps for the office (the standard red inked ""Entered"" was beyond boring), and the excitement was palpable when I ran across this set. Once the set was received, the excitement wore down quite rapidly as the ink pad that is shown in the picture, was dry as a bone, and a trip to the store was needed in order to use the stamps.I don't know why ""fun"" self-inking stamps have gone out of fashion, to be replaced by the bulky square wooden, and all the awkward wooden stamps. If versatility of ink color is an issue, rather than a child's-watercolor-set of ink pads, have a strip of individually packaged cartridge-ink-pads!!This is just my opinion, I could be wrong.......but I bought two of these sets, and both ink-pad-strips were completely dry and a waste of money."
3,Stamps are fun but ink quality is poor,"I bought this for my 3 year old who loves stamping. She does love the stamps (as do my 10 and 12 year old nieces). The handles are very easy for her little hands to hold, however the inks barely show up at all...even when I press down very hard on the ink pad."
4,stamper set,Stampers are nice but the ink is not such a good quality. I bought extra washable ink pads at a craft store.
3,Wooden Happy handle stamp set,I bought this for my granddaughter and she acted pleased. It is well built and a lot of fun for little kids. My only complaint is the ink for the stamps was pretty much dryed up. We added water and that made it usable.
2,"its ok, ive had better","Being a Melissa and Doug product i had very high hopes, however these stamps didnt do justice. My daughter has only used them a couple of times and 3 of the stampers have fallen off already. The ink has dried up quickly too. It is a cute little stamp set and lots of fun, great for 3 year olds i just wish they were a bit more durable!"
3,"Great stamps, disappointed in ink pad","I bought this for my 2 year old daughter, she enjoys it very much, she's able to grip these easily. However the ink pad arrived dry and adding water helped, but didn't completely fix it. When buying this I would suggest purchasing a separate ink pad unless you already have one from another set that works well."
1,Dry ink pads,"These stamps were completely useless because the ink pads were bone dry upon arrival. I tried wetting them, but it did not help. What a disappointment!"
1,Not as great as they look,"These stamps look like great quality, but they're actually harder for my daughter to use than the simple plastic stamp sets with lids in the dollar bins at Target or Michaels. The Melissa & Doug ink pads don't work that well and the wooden stamps are a pain to get in and out of the case. With kids, it's much easier not to have to wash the stamps after each use, and it would also be nice if the ink colors were separated with separate lids. OVERALL, this is an okay stamp set for adult use but not worth the money when you can get easier and cheaper stamps for kids."
1,"If it had cost more, I would have returned it.","Simply put, this is not sealed well enough to sit in whatever warehouse Amazon has it in. We ordered this for Christmas. Christmas morning comes, my daughter tries to use it... and all the ink has completely dried up already, before it was ever opened. Not only that, but the stamp pads are thin and hard and don't remoisten well.So sad."
1,Not worth the price,My kids made one or two pictures out of these stamps. They just aren't worth the money. The ink dried out after the first use because the babysitter didn't put the lid on tight enough. I imagine the ink wouldn't last that long anyway. I wouldn't purchase this item again.
3,Basic stamp set but MESSY,"I purchased this stamp set for my 2 year old daughter. The stamps are made of wood and rubber and the quality is good enough. However, the ink pad is a mess! It's all one piece so the colors get all smudged together, especially if you don't keep all the stamps and ink separately (which is impossible). Also, it comes in a storage box with no lid, so it all falls out anyway. Maybe this would be better for much older children."
5,Easy and fun,"Both my children love these stamps which are just the right size for their tiny hands and since the stamps are fairly small, they can fit lots of stamps on each page."
3,Toy is fine,"The product is what I expected--rubber stemps with wooden handles. They work just fine. I do have an issue with the little wooden box it came in--there's no cover, so the contents fall out if you don't hold it level. I was hoping to store this on a bookshelf, but it must be stored horizontally to prevent items from falling out, taking up much needed surface area."
2,it's ok,The stamps are cute but the stamp pad is not great. The top dose not latch on so have to use a rubberband to keep it closed. I guess it is worth what I paid for it.
4,Cute set,"It's a cute stamp set, and I like that it comes with multiple colors. The ink itself comes off easily and is washable, although the rubber stamps themselves are hard to clean out the nooks and crannies. Good toy, kids like it."
2,Not for young children,"I got this set for my 2 daughters (2.5 and 5 year old).The ink is not well washable, which can be a problem if they put some on carpet and clothes. They put stamps on their bodies and it took 2 baths to get the ink off.The variety of color ends up making all the stamps brown / black since children don't bother whipping them off of the previous color.They still had a lot of fun with them but I am now looking for washable inks with individual containers to avoid mixing."
1,Ink stains everything!!!,"OMG the blue ink is everywhere! The washcloths I used to try and wash the kid are stained blue. My bathtub is stained blue. Somehow ink got smeared on her plastic training potty and now it's stained!! Seriously, seriously false advertising."
4,easy to use,I bought this product for my son's second birthday. Is is easy to use and he has lots of fun with it.
3,"Simple, Small but beautiful","This stamps are really small, and they are very simple, whichever the use u wanna give it, its going to work for sue, but i thought they were going to be bigger. The handles are amazing but the ink doesnt last long"
1,Unworthy,"I'm a huge fan of the bagpipes, so it takes a lot to get me to speak ill of piping CDs. This CD, however, is not pleasant. The piping is done adequately, but it is marred quite a bit by being accompanied by organ playing. Additionally, hearing the same song more than once on a CD isn't what I'd choose. There are MUCH better CDs available; overspent when I found it at thrift store prices."
4,Same old archetypes,"I own three copies. A Russian friend of mine likes the retelling of the old tale- thinks it's a hillarious take on it, in fact.The writing isn't quick or biting. It feels more like a rote reinterpretation than an expression of creative inspiration. Most of the characters are repetitions of archetypes found elsewhere in her writing, especially the protagonist.The description of how the protagonist keeps himself awake through the firebird's sleep-inducing song is somewhat gruesome, and not as descriptive as would be most effective on the reader. She's taking too much of the middle path, imho.The firebird's reappearance in a later book makes this one more fun to read, though."
5,A Classic Fairy Tale Retold,"Mercedes Lackey fares best when she strays from the world of Valdemar. This work a retelling of a classic Russian Fairy Tale shows her at her best. Working with the original tale, she embellishes with fascinating glimpses of the hero's home life. He encounters not only the Firebird, but a dragon and a kitchen demon all of whom keep him from his fair princess. Let's hope that Ms Lackey sees fit to spin some more tales of old Russia."
5,One of my favorites!,"Wow, I recieved this book as a present by a friend who accidently thought it went with the Heralds series and ever since i cracked it open and read the first chapter its been one of my all time favorite books! When I'd finished reading it I couldn't believe it was over! I want a sequel!"
2,Just not very good.,"This is a pretty bad book. It's not the worst thing I've ever read, but it really wasn't worth my time. The prose is clunky, it seems poorly edited, the characters are either boring or unbelievable, mostly both, and the plot is not even a very good re-imagining of the classic Russian fairy tale. The pacing moved along all right, I suppose. It was quick to read. But it's just a really unimaginative book, and I found myself groaning and rolling my eyes a lot at the main character."
4,The only reason it was not a five. . .,was the rather rushed ending. I think that Misty was setting up for a sequel which hasn't yet gotten itself written.
3,"Good story, but terrible ending","I loved Lackey and everything, but this wasn't one of her best. I stayed up late nights trying to finish reading it. I even got in trouble at school just so I could find out what happened next. Then I finally reach the ending and it's just suddenly over. He gets what he wants only to discover he doesn't want it. So he runs off and the stories over. What happens next? You can't just end it like that it's just not right!"
4,Interesting characters make an enjoyable read.,"I recommend this fun, fast read for the wonderful characters that populate it. Lackey adds a new dimension to the classical fairy tale by describing the characters in a lively, realistic way. The world of the hero seems like a normal, real world with the typical jelousies, greed, and love. However, when the Firebird makes an appearance, the hero uncovers the magical aspects of his world as well. The combination of the hero's wits and Firebird's magic make an entertaining story"
2,it's an 'ok' book -- but I expected better,"I found the book just a little boring -- I couldn't finish it and actually skipped to the last few pages so that I could just find out what happened...only to find that I'd skipped the main thrust of the whole storyline. I expected better from Ms. Lackey, especially after _The Fire Rose_, which in my opinion is far better. I wouldn't recommend this to someone just starting to read Ms. Lackey's work."
5,Mercedes Lackey spews out yet another excellent novel...,"Being the ballet fanatic that I am, I expected the story of the Firebird to be similar to that of the ballet, and recieved a pleasant surprise when I found that there were several very interesting deviations. For example, they made it much more difficult from Ilya to get to the magician's soul (in this case his heart) which definitely made it more interesting. The beginning dragged a little, but as Ilya left his home and went out on his own, the story took on a completely new atmosphere, and it picked up from there. I definitely would recommened this to anyone looking for a good fantasy book to drown themselves in."
3,Worth reading...,"This is the first Lackey book I've read and I found it interesting.It was not that catching to start with, but soon the story unfolded. Ilya, the main character, is charming and smart. Once he sees the Firebird he's given the gift of speaking to and understanding animals. The bad part about seeing the Firebird, is that she brings bad luck. Well Ilya sure gets his share of that.The ending really disappointed me and that's why I rated it down. After building up a good story the book comes to an abrupt ""happily ever after "" ending"
4,A Little Less Snappy,"If you have seen the movie, That Thing You Do, you probably remember that Tom Hanks' character always wanted to hear tunes that were snappy. That's how I feel about practically all of my favorite Sandy Nelson tunes. The best ones offer the ultimate in snappy. This disc of Sandy's material from the late Sixties will definitely please his fans, but in my opinion, it has to grow on you a little, as we used to say. Right out of the box, this one seems to be a little too dense with horns and it has a little too much affinity for Motown, but the smoother sound improves with multiple listenings. I still prefer the ultimate snap of Let There Be Drums, Drums Are My Beat, and Boss Beat, but if you like Sandy Nelson half as much as I do, you will still try to wear this disc out."
1,poorly executed,This book lacks example problems and has an errata almost as thick as itself. Poorly explained topics complete this debacle.
2,not enough examples in book,"I'm using this book for my graduate class and i wish there were more examples. For some of homework questions, I don't even know where to begin."
5,A very satisfied costumer,"I got this movie 4 my hubby,as we started watch'n the movie it was so funny that we called over his brother & his wife & we all watch'd the movie & laugh'd so hard,I got cramps,if u like Katt Williams,Kelvin Hart,D.L.Hugley then this is the movie 4 u we give this movie 5 stars. Thanku,"
1,Better options out there!!,Don't buy this b/c you think it's the only hip carrier out there!! I almost bought this and after reading about how DANGEROUS it is and how many babies have fallen out (product was recalled 8/05) I decided to check other options. I found a GREAT alternative on babystyle.com and it is only $40!!!!!!!!!I was thrilled to find a much nicer (comes in three colors) and safer hip carrier!
1,Cheesy and cliche,"This book admits being some sort of tangent among success novels, but it really isn't the retrospective insight it promises. I can't believe it's had 11 straight 5-star ratings. I'm going to keep my anonymity here (in case of being flamed) by using the kids review option. The author just may be on the narcissistic edge. He has (I recall) around 15 lists, where (t)his book is number one on 10 of them. He names the lists things like ""How to be a happy college student"" or ""Live rich"", or some corny post modern infomercial lifestyle ideal catchphrase. It's impossible to escape this sort of stuff, so instead of buying this book, get an iPod, a toaster, a video rental, whatever. I'd say it's fine well and good if you want to read this 'manifesto', but this book is over-rated."
4,Got everything I want...,"The last person said this did not have the multi-disc shuffle or program mode. If he read through the manual once, he would have found it.One small issue is the SA-CD does not play through the digital optical output. You need to connect the full 5.1 audio set. This means I am doing double cabling just to make it work that the digital output could do by itself.I am very happy with it!"
4,Progressive Scan 5 Disc DVD Player - Very Nice,"Excellent features on this DVD player. The remote is a little confusing, but that is only due to the fact that I didn't read the manual. Most electronic remotes are intuitive, but the one supplied with this DVD player has a small learning curve. I would definately recommend this DVD player to anyone. Excellent piece of electronics."
1,wake me when it's over,"Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library.If I wouldhave spent.. I would have cried.The book started with a hbang and heldmy interest.However once I passed the ""fail Safe"" zone thisbook went downhill very fast.Almost could be described as childish.Ithoroughly enjoy medical thrillers but this is no Hot Zone or theCobra Event. Readers BEWARE!!!!"
1,What a piece of garbage!,"I can't believe I actually paid good money for this book.I'm not normally a person who stops reading books in the middle, but I could not bring myself to finish this. The author's grasp of medical science was almost nonexistent. His characters and dialogue were stock. And his depiction of life at an Ivy league university was truly laughable. (My friends who are university professors would definitely like to know how to make as much money as Scott's faculty characters. In reality, academia pays quite poorly.)Normally I like biotech thrillers, but not this one."
2,Odd street fighting,"Bas Ruttens lethal streetfighting DVD covers various situations that could occur in real-life confrontations. In this DVD Rutten shows the techniques that he thinks are the best for different situations. Here comes the biggest problem of this film, the techniques that Rutten shows may work great with Rutten, but poorly on normal people. Most of the techniques shown on this DVD demand a lot of power from the people performing them. And as you know, a typical MMA-fighter isn't a portrait of an average man. Therefore, this DVD doesn't work very well for most of the people.The most positive thing about this DVD is that it allways underlines the fact that its about street situations. Rutten seems to know a lot about real-life fights, and makes very good points that many people haven't even thought before.Bas Rutten also tells a lot of good things about the use of improvised weapons, a part of the DVD, that I would have hoped to be a little longer and more thorough."
3,A bit dangerous,"Thanks to this DVD I started Krav Maga. The video is well directed and the techniques are well executed. BR gives you some great tips on what to pay attention to when in a violent confrontation.After years of Krav Maga, i now find this DVD a bit dangerous. Some of the things it shows could get you hurt :)On the other hand some details are very difficult to be taught from a DVD.Nevertheless it is is a good try, but not a ""Lethal Street Fighting"" self defense system!"
1,BEWARE!,"This DVD is more like a $2.00 movie packaged in a $1.00 jewel case. What I received was a copy of an original (?) DVD. There was no instructions, no labels, and the DVD had a printed sticker on it. The product was not shrink-wrapped, but scotch-taped together. As for the DVD itself, I couldn't tell, since it wouldn't play on my player. However, eventually I was able to view it on a PC. There are no menus and the quality is terrible. The DVD must have been recoded with a very low quality-threshold. For the most part, this was an extremely disappointing experience. I contacted the seller (ShogunMedia @ 1-800-517-7445) and I was told not to start a pissing contest with them. If I didn't like, just ""ask Amazon for a refund"". If you _do_ want the DVD, try to get it from someone other than ShogunMedia."
1,Don't do it!,"I currently have a claim filed for this company, I never recieved my order , my account was debited and they never responded to any of my emails or inquiries.If I were you I wouldn't order from this company, buyer beware!!!"
3,Not Quite a System...,"Bas Rutten's LSFSDS is not what I'd call a fighting system. It's more like a collection of techniques and ideologies. So if you are currently studying another fighting style or martial art you could integrate as much of this material as you thought appropriate into your ""Tool Box"". It may also help you in defining the difference between sport fighting and/or demo arts AND street fighting. If you've never studied a fighting style this could be a good thing to get your head in the right place about fighting and what it takes to win a street fight. But regardless you need to train with the techniques and study the ideas so that you can use them when/if the time comes.Not to mention that there is a certain entertainment value to Bas' humor. Production quality is not the best and packaging is sophomoric (just so you know) But all in all its was a good purchase for me."
1,Bas Rutten Lethal Street Fighting,The supplier never delivered the DVD and Amazon is dragging it's feet in refunding my payment. I don't recomend either supplier or Amazon. This review will never make the review page!
3,not the best out there,"While Rutten is obviously a great fighter, that doesn't necessarily make him a great self-defense instructor. Many of these moves just are ""street ready"" and would fail the average size, average skilled man or woman in a confrontation. That, combined with the high price and poor production values here make this a second string choice for a martial arts DVD library. I have a huge collection of street defense type DVDs and if I had to recommend one or two this wouldn't be at the to of my list. If you want something that's packed with techinques that will work in a pinch, especially for those of us who aren't built like UFC champs or linebackers, check out Sang Kim's Junsado Fundamentals DVD."
4,a fascinating American discovery,"An amazing complex, compelling, and powerful work for a young American composer barely out of his twenties when he composed an entire Catholic Mass in the 1860's. There are a few awkward moments, such as bizarre vocal lines or slightly clunky orchestration, but still overall very effective. Very Victorian as well, but in a good way. Among the choruses, the Dona Nobis Pacem is a real knock-out, an ethereal and moving piece that fades into eternity. The finest solos include the yearnful tenor solo ""Quoniam"" and the delicately tragic ""Et incarnatus"" soprano solo. Recommended for all interested in the development of American classical music and in 19th century American cultural history. Could it be dubbed ""The Civil War Mass""! The orchestra is lush sounding under the baton of Schuller, but the chorus is rough, squawky, and somewhat imprecise, which is a shame for this piece of music."
2,Pilot the boat,"If you need to know the proper signals and lock procedures and tie-up protocol, this is the book for you. Not for me. I just want to sit and watch the country pass."
2,Tourist Map,"We ordered a typographical map for back country hiking. We ordered a map with elevation we needed to figure our lengths of hikes. We received a small folded map with tourist attractions, business locations and other popular places to visit. They left a price tag on it for $7.99. We feel as though we paid 3x times the price for a worthless planning tool."
3,It's ok,"Very detailed map with a lot of minor roads not shown on regular road maps. However, its quite large and can be difficult to read at night because of all the detail. Good supplement to a standard road map."
5,Map of the Big Island of Hawaii,"This is THE map you want to have when visiting OR living on the Big Island as we do. It is clear to read, everything well marked, and my son-in-law even laminated his, so he carries it in the trunk of his car, so he won't miss anything here on The Big Island!!"
1,Very dissapointed and truly upset,"I ordered the map, told there was going to be a delay, then told it was not available to order again from Amazon. Now this folded map i $975 for a $10 map? Someone punched a hole in their heads. This was a gift for my cousin who is coming over for her birthday and now it is rediculous.Map of Hawaii: The Big Island : Reference Maps of the Islands of Hawaii"
1,Hawaiin Map - want to exchange,"The description of this map was not clear and I would never have ordered it had I known that. I would like to exchange it, but, don't know how to do that."
3,"Good Map, but better ones on the island.","We moved here and I like it, but there are better ones that I've seen around."
3,Fine if you get others with it to fill in the blanks,"This map is fine if you need a wide-shot of the island, but if you want to really explore and want a map with every conceivable attraction/waypoint marked, you should buy The Ready Mapbook of West Hawaii and The Ready Mapbook of East Hawaii (depending on where you plan to spend most of your time). These mapbooks were indispensable to us."
3,"Good, Not Great","This is one of a series of CDs from Motown that repackages earlier works from different artists in an attempt to maximize corporate revenue. Having said that, there is some good stuff on this CD, and it is cheap, making it a respectable value. Rick James is a talented musician, singer, and songwriter, so if you want an introduction to one of the kings of the bass line, this is a good place to start. It is not all inclusive, by any means, but does at least have the one thing every Rick James fan needs, namely ""Super Freak"", probably his ultimate recording.This collection isn't great, but it is good. For an introduction to Rick James this works very well."
1,Poor quality,"The pictures are dark and blurred and it is hard to make out the alphabet. It is not useful for teaching children the alphbet, it is not even attractive."
2,Wait a second,"This book is very handy, but one should not underestimate the impact that the lack of structure has. After reading the book, you will be overwhelmed by the redundancy and repitition. Yes the book is filled with handy tips, but in the end, that is all they are tips, which treat the symptoms of bad communication; NOT THE CAUSES. Without a structure, explaining the root causes, some tips are contradictory, some say the same thing in a different way and in the end one is stuck with a huge volume of data, but little information. I am afraid the scope of this book works against it, not for it."
2,napolean book of fate and oraculum,The published took what appears the original book and photocopied it into a large format paperback book....creating a small page in the middle of a large page with large margins on four sides. The quality of the print is poor and not easy to read....some of the type is blurred. Reading the type is what I call WORK. Other than that its fine but its not something I'd recommend to someone else.
5,Intriguing,Whether you believe or not this book is definitely a fascinating study of occult divination.
1,"Is Like Car Wreck, You Want to Turn Away, but Can't","Besides, I couldn't find the remote, was working on my laptop and didn't want to get up to go hunt for it. Also, I thought, man.. this is beautiful scenery. And it's Christopher Lambert - The Highlander! Lord Greystoke! He wouldn't be in a horrid film. It has to get better.He was. And it didn't. It only kept getting worse. It was seriously so bad, I kept thinking maybe it was the Monty Python edition.Dialogue.. ugh. Character development, cliched and nonexistant. Acting was nothing short of pathetic.Nothing. Made. Sense. Who made this film and why? A hundreds of year old strong immortal gets sidetracked by a girls boobs and gets ""staked"" by a 20 year old? Are you kidding me? Now.. if you can watch this for FREE, and have a bottle of booze, make it a drinking game. That might be fun. But if you ""drink"" at ""any ridiculous part"", you'll be schnockered 1/4 way through.Good for a laugh, nothing more."
2,Angst,There's so many films with vampires who suffer angst about being a vampire. This is one of them. The best scene is easily obtainable on YouTube - where Elizabeth (Irena A. Hoffman) extends her fangs and ALMOST bites Keith (Corey Sevier).When the best bit is where the bite never actually happens you know you can give it a miss. Unless you like seeing Christopher Lambert look really old
3,I've seen worse!,"This was not a great vampire movie but it was fun. I like the relationship between Elisabeth and Keith and how she's attracted to him for his compassion of her ""misunderstood"" mother. Christopher Lambert is funny-after he becomes a vampire; he's a dud before. I also love the shaking crosses, big and small...If you are kind to vampire movies you might enjoy it."
4,Good for kids having gap of 0.5-3.5 years,"Very good stroller but since I bought when I had second kid with an older sibling of 5 years. But still I use it but cannot take full advantage of it. The very first thing I had to do was to remove the rear canopy and rear seat; cause there is no way a 5 year old can sit front facing. And in that case I should have bought the one without rear canopy and seat there by not paying the premium for having having extra seat and canopy.I would have loved this stroller if my kids were 3 years apart and would have given a 5 star rating but just this is not perfect fit for me; I have given 4 stars.Overall, the stroller is a value for money. Other cons are same with any other double stroller...little difficult to operate, too big, bulky.One thing I didn't like it was if there is anything in stroller basket, it is difficult to close and stuff in the basket may fall also."
4,Be prepared.,"We've found this stroller to be capacious and sturdy, but be prepared, you will feel like you are piloting a dreadnought, especially in crowded places. This particularly applies if you have a carseat mounted in the front."
4,Just buy it!,"I researched double strollers for three months before finally deciding on this one. What a great choice! I love it. So easy to assemble and disassemble when it's time to switch the back seat.A few things to know:Front seat does not recline fully.Check that your infant carrier fits before buying, doesn't accommodate all infant car seats.Will forfeit basket space for loving everything else!No tray for backseat passenger.I gave it 4 stars because nothing is perfect."
2,"Loved the stroller until it broke, support is terrible","I loved this stroller until mine broke. I have only been using it since December, and I rarely use it (4 or 5 times a month) but the 'sturdy' platform in the back is cracked. I contacted support last week to find out where to get a new platform. So far all I have received is questions regarding when I purchased it and how heavy my kids are. I have a 3 year old girl and a 9 month old and they are not heavy kids (30lbs and 19 lbs). Still the platform broke and I need a replacement. I wasn't asking for anything for free, although many good companies would have been more helpful. So here I am a week later with no solution. Apparenlty timely communication is not their strong suit. In the meantime I am considering getting a different brand of a double stroller so I am not without for any longer. If we wouldn't have had an issue with the cracked seat and the related support I would have given this stroller 5 stars."
4,perfect stroller for growing family,"I got this stroller for my 2 yr old and a newborn. It is perfect for them both and will grow with the toddler as he decides he is too big for a stroller. It is lightweight (you have to remember DOUBLE stroller), easy to steer, and has great features. One thing that makes it 4 stars and not 5 is that it says carries most major brand infant carriers. A little misleading. Other brands simply just rest on the bar and you have to use a strap to secure it. The strap is adjustable but only one side and was extremely difficult to adjust for the carseat I had planned on using. Even strapped in, the carseat still slid around a little and made me feel uncomfortable about it. We ended up buying their carseat so it would securely ""click"" in. I am VERY happy with the stroller and carseat. Even considering the cost of a new carseat it is still cheaper tp have this system and grow with it than it is to purchase another stroller later."
5,Great double stroller!,"I bought this stroller through target and we love it! I have a baby and a 3 year old. My toddler loves it and my baby car seat(Eddie Bauer) fits just right. Easy to push and stir, a little heavy but it is a double stroller. Easy to fold."
5,stroller for TWO,"Gift for mother of one, expecting 2nd child. So excited she can hardly wait to use, so I cannot review the USE of this stroller, but can say that it looks like the Mercedes of strollers."
5,Deluxe Sit N' Stand,I am very happy with the service and product I recieved!! I will shop here again.
4,CD-R Music: as advertised,"These are reasonably priced discs and, so far, they have all recorded music from my computer as advertised."
3,Not great for stand alone CD recorders,"Stand alone CD recorders need blank Music CD's, which have an OPC code on them, so they can be recognized by the recorder allowing the disc to be recorded on. Maxell has had a very good Music blank CD in the past, but this is not it. I've had some work, a few work only for a song or two, and some don't work at all. Don't waste your money on the Maxell Music CD's (or the TDK, which are even worse - they just don't work), but go for the Sony Music CD's (I tried the ones in the purple package and they work fine). Sony Music CD's have the OPC code and they work in stand alone CD recorders."
4,As good as it gets,These CD-R's are perfect. The sound quality is good and they are less expensive than many others.
5,just what i needed,"I love how quick amazon ships items. I have purchased several items from them, and have not been disapointed yet. thank you"
2,Don't waste your time or money,"Of all of the CD-R Music media I have used, Maxell has been by far the worst. Out of a spindle of 30 I have had to throw at least half of them away (and a number of the CD's that ""worked"" I burned pictures to, so it wasn't just a music issue).When I contacted Maxell they agreed based on my feedback that I was using the discs correctly and asked for information from the packaging (which had been discarded; there is nothing of note on the packaging beyond what is on the shrink wrap). Then they asked me to send the bad discs in for replacement (and since I generally don't sit down to burn 30 discs at a time, most of these had again, been discarded as the problems occurred).I think that Maxell will work with you if you save all of the ""garbage"" (shrink-wrap, bad discs) - but it seems unlikely that someone is going to save/collect these things over the course of using the entire spindle."
1,Cheap Imitation of Real Maxell Quality,"We own a recording studio and make fine classical compilations. Maxell must have sold the quality rights or are making these ""pro"" discs on the cheap. Maxell USED TO BE a brand we could trust (their high-expatial metal cassette tapes are without compare - THE BEST) but now every third on of these CD-R discs are defective (can't record) and then when you do get a recording down it lasts for a few plays then skips. These are almost as bad as the worst - the Memorex discs. What a waste of money - no wonder they are so cheap. If you want to get the REAL quality get with FujiFilm CD-R Pro. If you can find them in the US (we get ours from the UK). We wouldn't use another Maxell disc if they gave them to us. What a cheap defective product they now are (like so many other American goods) - they sold out somewhere along the way. Too bad for them and anyone that still uses their discs."
4,The Perfect In-Flight Distraction,"This relatively brief volume (184 pages in paperback) is the perfect departure-to-arrival gate light read - and I do mean light - for any plane prisoner wishing to isolate him/herself from the petty annoyances of modern day air travel, and harvest a few chuckles in the process. The travel misadventures described therein brought to my recollection the time I locked myself INSIDE my car in Portsmouth, England, the time I was grandly fleeced by gypsy pickpockets in Rome, and the experience of donating blood in Leningrad (St. Petersburg). I found the most amusing of the 28 stories to be Sterling's ""The Deep Fried Potato Bug"", Mayle's ""The Great Goat Race"", and Wallace's ""Shipping Out"". So, unless you're so unfortunate as to have never journeyed outside of you own neighborhood, you're sure to find something here that strikes a cord of sympathy or remembrance, or an outright funny-bone."
3,"Cute, diverse, and frequently laugh-out-loud funny","These brief excerpts from larger works are enjoyable slices of travel humor. Each story ends, Reader's Digest style, with an unrelated one-paragraph anecdote. Also, dotted throughout the text are boxes of quotations. This is a fun introduction to humor writers that you may not have heard of before. For politically correct sourpusses, there's one funny story about an Irishman who comes to Virginia and endures various cockups. And yes, the one about the baboon in the movie theater is indeed startling and funny. All in all, a fun read."
4,Thoroughly delightful!,Was I reading the same book? I didn't find the authors whiny nor bathroom humor abudant. I thought the book was fun -- although I'm glad I waited until I was back home to read it!
1,happy then sad,"This was a 20th wedding anniversary gift from my wife and after wearing this watch only four times (on Sundays)the seconds hand became loose (detached). I always wanted a Bulova and was very happy with the price paid. I called Customer Service at Famous Brand and she was very nice & helpful. She also was very surprised that the watch was deffective. I was given the option of shipping it to Bulova for repair or return it to Famous Brand for a refund. I chose the refund. Not sure if I will want the same watch again, very dissapointed"
2,Going through the motions,Water's Edge or (as known in America Sweet Six) is the groups second release as a 3 piece. It's predecessor: Cut Above The Rest had came off quite nice. The band sounded reborn and ready to take on the world. A lack of single success however caused sales to drop off quite a bit from the Level Headed record (which had spawned the titanic hit single Love Is Like Oxygen) the previous year.It seems on Waters Edge that the group is going through the motions. Churning out eighties synth pop is an attempt to get a hit. A mdeiocre effort from an otherwise great band.
3,THIS BOOK IS FOR NON-FICTION AUTHORS!,"While the information in this book is useful, it is specifically aimed at non-fiction authors. In addition, NF authors aiming at the mainstream - NY top 10, Oprah etc. Much of the book is given over to the NF NY Top 10 game, sadly.Authors like myself, who neither wish to write NF or subscribe to the the tiresome values of the mainstream - instead, wishing to write literature or fringe work - will be severely disappointed.[...]"
4,"Excellent, relatively inexpensive short aerobars.","These short, highly adjustable aerobars are almost everything that I'd hoped they would be.Be warned: they take time to configure on account of all the options. That is, don't expect to get them just right the first time.All adjustments are easy to make, and the whole assembly tightens down securely. They seem pretty well designed and made. They seem sturdy.By the third or fourth ride, they were just right (surprisingly comfortable) and I've been enjoying them the last few months.My only complaint is as follows: the last few inches around which one wraps one's fingers could be longer. I tend to keep them angled slightly more to the vertical than most, perhaps, and when I tuck tightly down I practically run out of bar (propping myself against about a half an inch). But, one of the reasons that I bought them is because of this preference. So, in that sense, I am a little disappointed."
4,helpful aerobars,"First pair of Aero Bars. Wonderful for a different riding position. Extremely adjustable. Everything on these can be adjusted so that fit perfectly. The only reason I didn't give it a fifth star was that I wished they were a little bit longer. I'm 6'-1"" tall and would like another half inch on the bars. Very well made and they supply you with additional bolts so you can take full advantage of every possible position you can think of."
2,Tri Bars,"Good product, had to modify to fit the bars on my bike. Would be nice to see a stats for the minimum circumphrance of the handlebar that this fits.I am dissappointed that the bars are not an inch longer. But overall they are working well.Longer bars from elbow to hand, would be nice, just 1 inch or so. Circumfrance of the handlebar cannot be the small bars. (I fixed with sprinkler pipe PCV."
1,Please Enter A Title For Your Review,"I only like two songs on this CD, ""The Fitz,"" and I Fought The Law (radio edit); and now I'm even tired of them. I guess I'll be giving it away like I did the last CD I had by this band."
5,Illuminating,"When you read this book you will find it to be informative and enlightening. When I first recieved this book I did not have the time (or so I thought) to really read the book, until I had a day of crisis. That afternoon I sat with this book in my hands and just asked for guidance, opened the book and there it was, Divine guidance at my fingertips being delivered by a genuine, loving woman who touched my soul. I carry this book with my all the time along with my journal, I have read it many times. I feel a connection to author, She writes as though she is writing directly to me. I can gaurantee this book will change your life, I know it has changed mine. Mary Balchi CHThe Little One Diaries, Volume One"
4,I don't even like Elvis!,"Okay, so he was hot, but I've never been much of an Elvis fan... you don't need to be with this book though! I was so impressed by the authors in this book, particularly the hilarious piece by Mcclintock who managed to incorporate all the writers I've studied in grad school into a piece involving Elvis. It was genius! So even if you don't care much for Elvis, I strongly recommend this book!"
4,Good stuff,The Star Brite waterproofing and fabric treatment worked as expected. I used a garden pressure sprayer to apply and the wand gave me additional reach to cover the bimimi top. I don't know how long the waterproffing will last but I will find out.
5,sonic aqua planet,"This book was really neat. I love Sonic s stories because he is so fast and brave. You should by this book for your kids too, they will enjoy it!Geffry Fahey"
5,Charlotte does it again!,The Sonic books by Charlotte Fullerton are real knuckle-biters! She writes thrillers and keeps your full attention----each page is a cliffhanger! My son has never seen the television show-LOVES her books!
4,"Interesting, but not as radical as you might think","Rushkoff presents a thesis that the main tenets of Judaism are iconoclasm, radical monotheism, and social justice. Using this framework, he then suggests that many have gone astray by their preoccupation with issues such as Jews as a ""people"" or intermarriage.This work is ambitious and well-written. However, it is not really as radical as the author has packaged it. For instance, the final chapter of his book emphasizes how practicing Jews must become more versed in Torah to revitalize and re-invent rituals. This is common belief in the Reconstructionist movement. He also underscores the critical role of social justice and universalistic themes -- which are hallmarks of Reform Judaism.Actually, I agree with many of his assertions, but find it odd that he doesn't connect these themes into the major movements which currently espouse such ideals..."
4,Something to chew on,"The author is not a Rabbi but it is clear that he has done more than a bit of research on the topic. His position, while decidedly different from the mainstream, does give one pause to think about the relationship between the religious and the religion.As one professionally trained in Christian Theology, I find this approach very refreshing and appropriately uncomfortable. As I read pages, my mind kept saying ""and this applies to non-Jews as well."" Anyone from the three traditions that see their roots in the story of Abraham should find this a really thought provloking read.There are portions that do drag a bit, but read through them because there is always a wonderfull insight following the slow portion."
2,"A few interesting ideas, but","mostly just another attempt to conform Judaism to someone's preexisting ideological vision of the world, arrived at completely independently of Judaism."
1,A life without faith,"Going through life without faith is a sad existence.All ideas shared in the book are a fine presentation, better said compilation of thoughts by Conservative and Reform theologians.The paradox is to give such validity to the early thinkers of Judaism with the absence of a Divine mandate."
1,Nasty and Profane,"This is a horrible book written from a very nasty point of view. Basically, this is a systematic dismantling of everything sacred about Judaism - to the point where the author actually uses the sacred name of God in the book. Obviously, the author knew that his use of the name of God would deeply insult those devoutly Jewish, and just as obviously, the author did not care if he insults deeply held beliefs.It's important to understand that this is coming from a man that feels that what is now Israel will soon no longer exist as the Jewish homeland - and he demonstrates absolutely no concern for that, either.No concern for the basics of the Jewish religion, disdain for the Jewish homeland, and disdain for the future of the Jewish race. Anti-religion, Anti-Judaism, Anti-Israel. There's a word for that."
1,Worthless,"It is ironic, Nothing Sacred : The Truth About Judaism is nothing but lies.Rushkoff's understanding of Judaism and scripture is hugely limited and flawed. Not sure what his point is, save to say it is quite wron"
4,I agree with most reviews...,"This is a decent read, teaches you some important topics like collections, strings, etc. But if you buy this book, supplement your reading with a complete VB book."
2,"Nice, but way to small for most dSLRs","Pros:*Nice looking bag*Fits nicely at hip*Plenty of pockets*No zipper when you open the flap makes it SUPER EASY to pull your camera out for a quick shotCons:*Very narrow front to back and very deep top to bottom which makes it very, very difficult to position dividers*Dividers are too tall for my dSLR leaving too little room between the top of the divider pad and the top of the cavity (camera rides too high)*Can't put camera and spare lens inside AND have dividers between them*Velcro is too hard to position and peel on and off; I wonder how durable the velcro straps would be*No zipper on top flap may be off-putting for some"
2,scratched my xsi,"bought this based on the quick review that it fits my Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XSi and it does. however, after two weeks of usage, i noticed a few scratches on the pop up flash part of the xsi body. ignored it the first day as maybe the clip from the bag accidentally nicked it. the second day, the scratch got bigger. the velcro holding the bag's adjustable panels developed into a hard plastic edge and was scrapping the camera body inside the ""protective"" case as i was carrying it while walking. now my Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XSi has ""battle damage."" turned me off tamrac products altogether.btw, it's not like a little messenger that doesn't look like a camera bag. it's more like a lunch box size thing that still garnered me a ""man-purse"" comment from people on the street."
5,Great stylish bag,"It fits (barely) a Nikon D40 w/ either 18-55mm or 55-200mm lens attached and the other stored, extra battery and charger, assorted filters, SB400 speedflash, lens hood, remote, and assorted small cleaning/data storage/personal stuff. If you've got any more than that or like a bag with some room, get something bigger as the camera/lenses/flash are VERY snug and the bag couldn't comfortably tolerate anything much wider. I don't have a problem with fitting the strap to the side of the camera like other reviewers. As everything fits snugly and looks GREAT (not like most camera bags). I couldn't be more pleased."
4,"A small, well made bag","Trust in the reviews that this is a small bag but as long as you are in the market for a light-weight, sturdy bag that will hold a mid-sized DSLR and maybe a few small attachments, you will be happy with this bag. I would say the schematics in the product profile may be a bit skewed to make it appear larger but trust in the users reviews that it is a bit smaller than pictured.Luckily, I purchased mine in a camera store and could see it first hand before buying.My only drawback concerning this bag is that the shoulder strap is not removable. If you are carrying it by the hand strap, the shoulder strap dangles in the way.The sections inside can be removed or reshaped to suit your needs via strong velcro.The build is tough and there is a stylish, leathery/velvet front design that catches the eye."
3,smaller than I expected,"I purchased this bag with the intention to fit a Canon 60D with a 18-128mm lens and a Canon 430EXII flash. The bag barely fits even after removing a divider. The velcro is in the way when taking the camera in and out of the bag. Kind of clumsy. The front lock does not work sometimes when the angle is off a little, which should not happen. Otherwise, it is compact and seemed to be well built to last."
2,Nice bag but too small,"I purchased this bag to hold a Nikon 3100 with an 18-55 lens as well as a 55-200. I like the design but found it too small. A previous reviewer indicated that this was a good fit, but I don't agree. If I tried to squeeze both camera and extra lens in, they would have been very difficult to remove. I returned the the bag and ordered the Tamrac Rally 4 instead, but not before checking it out at a local store. The Rally 4 is about two inches wider and a bit deeper, making it a lot easier to insert and remove things."
4,pretty awesome smaller bag,"I'm a dentist and have a Canon rebel xsi I use for intraoral photos. I was looking for a smaller bag that can fit in a narrow space. I can fit my macro lens (100mm), the standard lens the camera comes with, the body, and the macro ring lite flash (MR-14EX) inside the main compartment. The ring part of the flash won't fit unless I tuck it into the front zippered pocket. You could probably fit another smaller lens as well.I thought that the front lighter part of the bag was a pale yellow color. However, it really is more of a weird brown color. Not quite what I was expecting, but still nice.The shoulder strap can be tightened, but if you do, the ends are loose and hang funny. They are not attached to the rest of the strap and are not a loop like I'm used to.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase. All of my gear fits in a compact bag."
3,Attractive Bag Could Use Some Minor Improvements,"Great looking bag but the inner velcro straps are rather sharp so you have to take care lest it rubs on your equipment. The side pockets are not very useful either, would be better if they were fully enclosed for small items that are often used.Otherwise, it affords good protection for your equipment."
4,Great for less,"I have been using this bag for a year now and it works fine. For the beginner photography who just wants to carry around there camera and lens plus the cords and a book or two, this bag is for you. Its very easy to organize everything, and with the deviators that are adjustable, it just makes it more easy to keep things where you want them. So if you dont have too much camera stuff and want a small easy bag, then this is for you!"
4,Too small for basic equipment.,"I'm not sure how everyone is stuffing this bag but there is no room for this basic equipment;Canon XTI with 24-60mm attachedBG-E3 battery grip580EX II FlashForget about an extra lens. I like a little more protection than a thin coat of canvas busting at the seams for a $400 flash. This is my second purchase based on reviews and the second bag that is not adequate for basic equipment.My next trip is to a brick and mortar to actually see the physical capacity of a bag before purchasing. Otherwise, if you have a small camera and few accessories, this bag would be ideal. It is well built and sleek."
4,"Good bag, but not enough space","The Tamrac 3536 is a beautiful bag and the suede adds an air of professionalism to the package, however it's just far too small. I recently bought a D80 and with the stock lens with lens hood inserted into the bag with padded inserts intact, the lens would zoom out as I tried to remove the camera. I now store the lens hood elsewhere. Also, it does get quite packed once you add the charger and other items, so be careful.I did however use the bag in some fairly dirty environments, and it cleaned off perfectly with a damp cloth, so that's a pretty big plus for me."
5,Tamrac 3536 Express 6 Camera Bag,"Great camera bag Well designed and well made. Stylish design. Dividers cushion lenses, camera, etc.Dividers are cushions protecting camera items. They are held in place well with velcro and can easily be memoved if desired. Bag is comfortable to wear and to use. A very good buy."
4,This is a really nice bag!,"This is a really nice bag for a small camera, just kind of small for a Nikon D300. I can put my camera in it, and one backup battery, maybe my cell phone, too. But if you have more than one camera lens, I have no way to put it in."
3,"Nice, but too small for my camera","I was looking for essentially a single camera case that didn't look like a camera case. This case was well made and didn't look like your typical camera case. It was small like I had hoped, but it ended up too small for my Nikon D200. There is also no way that this would have held a camera and a couple of other smaller lenses as described. Probably good if you are looking for a small and light carrying case with minimal accessories and a camera that is smaller than the D200 (maybe good for the D40 & D40X's)."
1,Deceptive!,"This bag is expressly advertised - via the provided cross-sectional of the bag - to fit not only a digital SLR camera with large lens attached, but also a flash unit, lots of pocket space for small things and two additional lenses. Nothing could be farther from the truth.This bag could barely fit my camera body with 14-16mm lens attached (not that big of a lens), much less any additional units. I attempted to fit my 430exII flash, a 35mm prime (small lens) and a 50mm prime (very small lens) - it wasn't close to fitting. Furthermore, as soon as you fill the bag up - the outer pockets become squished so you can't fit anything in them either.Get the larger bag."
4,Good bag; not as big as they say.,"Bought it for a Nikon D40x. The info says you can get a couple of extra lenses in it, but there isn't enough room. I can only fit one extra lens in it and it makes things quite crammed. The construction, feel and look of the bag are excellent, though. Next time I'll go larger on the space side of things."
3,"High quality, not so big","This bag is really well made and water-proof. It wasn't as big as I had hoped...hard to fit much else in with my Nikon D70 or Nikon D80. The adjustable inside dividers are also quite hard to move as the velcro sticks right when you put them in. Would suggest not moving them if you don't need to. Otherwise it's great. The outer pockets expand nicely and fit more than I though. Overall I would recommend it, but maybe for a smaller camera unless you don't need extra space for lenses and wallet etc."
3,Not as large as I thought.,I was disappointed.....then I got a double shipment.....so I am sending them BOTH back!
3,Keep Your Remote Close By At All Times,"Better yet, were it not for the Daleks' cry of ""Exterminate!"", just mute the sound altogether. The dialogue's not that great anyway; but it's the music that's absolutely ear piercingly horrendous. Maybe they were trying to mimic the ""Doctor Who"" electronic sound; but whatever they were trying, it came across as blackboard scratching with a vengeance. That's a shame, because the film itself was quite good. The setting and story both followed the original ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" almost scene by scene - with the exception that the ending was actually almost believable. Whereas the original ending was a hodge-podge of incredibly far-fetched events, this ending at least pretended to be ""scientific."" And, as others have noted, there was way too much gratuitous slapstick (for the kids, no doubt). All in all, I'd give the visuals and the story-line 4-Stars; but the music drug it down to a 3-Star movie at best."
3,A feature film of a television serial,Interesting to have a full motion picture of the classic Who serial. Good special effects and pace. Don't know where to fit this story in with the rest of Doctor Who continuity but it is pleasant nevertheless. Peter Cushing does a great job as the Doctor and the Daleks are superb! END
4,Doctor Who-Daleks-Invasion Earth 2150 AD,While markedly DIFFERENT form the British SERIES Peter Cushing's performance as (the human) DOCTOR WHO is great fun.
4,Coast Guard oft overlooked victory.,The Cutters of the USCG served an invalueable role in the Battle of the Atlantic. I wish this book had looked at some of the other ships used by the USCG in the war. Like the bouy tenders.
3,lagging,"Really excited to start this, as my dad was in the Coast Guard and his vessel is frequently mentioned - but halfway through feels like it isn't going anywhere. Maybe it'll pick up if I stick with it."
5,Horror in the Atlantic,Mike Walling backs up for a running start: he describes the sudden attention paid to the Coast Guard by the Navy before WWII was even declared. I wonder if the record of 1 hour and 45 minutes still stands for painting a white ship battleship gray.In chapter after chapter he delineates the torpedoing of merchant ships by the dozen and the storms never seemed to let up. The rescues of a pitifully few men are nothing short of amazing. It reads like a whodunnit even though we know how it comes out.Mike takes some statistics and breathes life into them making the reader really care what happens to the ships doomed or not. I'm guessing that surviving U-boat commanders are reading it and learning how it all came out.The judges of the Samuel Eliot Morison award for Navy literature are to be commended for tearing themselves away from the book and awarding it the prize.
4,Very touching and personal.,"Kudos to Louie Anderson for revealing his private and candid insight regarding his father's alcohol abuse. For any of us who lived with alcohol abuse, reading this book is worthwhile reinforcement that we are not alone.The book is an easy read and can easily be finished in a day, but the message is one that can have lasting effects if the reader allows it to sink in. It also reminded me to try to be a little more forgiving and open-minded. I felt it was absolutely worthwhile."
3,Not an entirely satisfying read,"This book hopes to explain why the world is currently facing a childhood obesity crsis. It places blame on multimedia and national apathy, rather than on individual action. While most of the authors points are well made and researched, the book covers material that has been widely available to most North Americans. Solutions are suggested, but some are not well thought out, and perpetuate other social and global concerns such as child labour in third world countries. While educational, this is not an entirely satisfying read."
4,Great Buy,"I received my Futon sooner than expected and love it. I have no complaints about this product and would recommend it to anyone who needs a spare bed. It's very well built and was fairly easy to put together. I still haven't had a guest sleep on it so I don't know how comfortable it is yet, but it is a quality futon mattress (extra thick) and I'm sure it is very comfortable-my Boxer Booder sure thinks so!!!"
4,Would give it higher rating if instructions were better,This is a well built piece of furniture. Very comfortable. The instructions are horrible and their website isn't much help.
4,Would definitely recommend,"The unit is very comfortable with the 9"" mattress. The materials are sturdy real wood -- no MDF boards. The only draw back is that there is assembly required."

5,Great British Mystery Series,My wife and I love British Mysteries and this series is one of the best. The acting is top notch and the writing and banter are superb.
3,Dalziel and Pascoe Season 1,The first episode on this disc was a real disappointment.We got to the last two scenes when the DVD froze.Amazon was great about getting a new package to us the next day - andthe same thing happened. The rest of the disc was fine.SO I thought I'd order it on InterLibrary Loan in RI - and the sameproblem. So this is a give-up situation!BBH
4,amm6,"I am sure that this is an excellent book, but I bought it for my great-grandson for his birthday at the suggestion of his mother. However, his guinea pig died before he received it."
4,Kids book,Obviously. My daughter loves it. Hopefully it will help stave off the desire for an actual pet for a while.
2,I love Guinea Pigs: Read and Wounder,"This book was more like first grading reading, I didn't like it very much. It didn't have the information I was seeking in it on how to take care of guinea pigs the grooming and what to do if one gets sick and so forth, so I just gave it a 2 star rating."
4,Easy to Use,"For all of you who have spiral binders or those huge 3-ring binders of the CMMI model, this is the book for you. It is condensed, addresses both staged and continuous representations and has from what I can tell all the information from the 725 page version available from the SEI website. It is organized a little differently but, it is pretty user friendly. It has tab like features that identify the process areas and the process areas are in alphabetical order - very easy to use. I know carry this around with me like I used to carry around the CMM hardcover version."
4,Really Smokin' Jam,this was my Jam about a Year ago.Cee-Lo was truly feeling it as a Solo Artist.this Jam had alot of fun&the Video took it to another element.One of My Favorite Jams from last Year.
1,fake bamboo looks really cheap,The fake bamboo looks really cheap. A lot of the descriptions don't tell you it's not real bamboo either. Poor construction also-it does not consistently empty when full. Not very soothing or meditative. Overall a waste of money and once you have it the cost of shipping to return it is not even worth it. Unsatisfied.
4,The best I've found -- but not perfect,"Pros: Accurate to within 5 seconds a month, as measured by an atomic clock. Simple to operate. Two time zones easily available. Being able to turn off unused features.Cons: Alarms are too soft and not adjustable for volume. Customer service has never responded to a single email or phone call."
3,Timex watch,"I have used Casio G-Shock watches for a few years but decided to go with this Timex. Good looking watch with large easy to read face. Indiglo 'Flix' is a nice feature and it is easier to read than a G-Shock. But, watch is showing wear after a short time. The resin band scuffs easily and tilts the watch away from easy view. Wish Timex had alternate time/world time but the 3 alarm times are nice. Some lettering on the band came off on the first day of wear, not a show stopper but irritating. Watch looks good but I think it will be back to the G-Shock in the future."
4,"Good watch, Great price","For the price, this watch is great. Many features and the watch will obviously stand up to much abuse. A little heavy but nothing you don't get used to after wearing a few days. Overall my favorite Timex yet."
3,Sort of great.,"I love this style watch. It has everything I need for a decent price and looks good doing it.I purchased a similar watch from Kohls except mine had a velcro band attached to, what appears to be, resin connectors on the watch body. I hate the resin. It doesn't last more than 6 months before cracking... but none of that matters because the watch got moisture in it after 2 months.Yup, it looks more expensive than it really is... because it's cheaper than it looks."
3,Too large!,"To be fair, I should have checked the watch's height, which is 17 mm, 2 mm thicker than my Casio G-shock. I'm not a large man and the watch was simply too high on my wrist. I did run through the operations, and it's very simple to operate. I've had good experiences with Ironman watches in the past and have ordered a 100m WR model (13 mm height) which should fit better.This type of watch can't be worn with a long sleeved shirt, but of course it's not the kind for that purpose. If you don't mind the bulk of the T5F821, I recommend it. I'm returning the watch for a refund, but as stated above am ordering a more appropriate model."
4,good,"I like the watch it is easy to read & looks good, it is slightly larger then I would like. The indiglo is different then my old timex in the numbers light up instead of the whole face of the watch."
3,"Great Watch, but missing the Users Manual","I really liked the watch, but it was missing the Users Manual in the box. Could you send me that? Thanks, Gustavo"
1,Does not last long,"I've bought this watch on February 2011. It stopped working around July 2011, which I consider a very short life for this product. At first, I thought it was just the batteries that died. I've replaced the batteries, adjusted the time/date but it keeps restarting as if the batteries were dying again. After a few times I readjusted the time/date I gave up.It's a shame, this is my second Timex. The first one lasted almost 5 years and that's why I've purchased another Timex. I still think it can be fixed (it must be a short-circuit that keeps restarting itself every other day). Does anyone know where I can take it to have it fixed?"
5,Great for freedivers,"This is a great watch for freedivers. Large easy to read numbers, Indiglo for night operations. I have used mine underwater in both fresh and salt water and for timing static apnea. I have used it so much I wore the coating off the start button. There were never any issues from using the buttons under water. I am buying another one as my old one is pretty beat up, strap broken, and not so pretty anymore. I would replace the strap, as the battery is still going strong and all the functions work just fine, but it is simpler and quicker just to buy a new one. Interestingly, I bought my original one in Singapore where it was pretty expensive. Much cheaper now by a factor of about 4. I will keep buying them as long as they are available."
5,Timex Men's T5F821 Ironman 30-Lap Shock,"Thank You Very Much.Very good and qualitative watch.I pay this item at Amazon.comOn a hand they look even better, than on a picture.Hours very conveniently sit on a hand. Also are made of very good stuff and are pleasant to the touch.It is pleasant that G-Shock and it is possible to swim easy in them.Also are convenient in management of buttons. Very much it is pleasant Indiglo - time at night is well visible.I yet haven't found out lacks.From advantages - Three times can show one pressing of button Start Split. And also the attractive price 40$.I am very happy with these watchVladimir."
1,Don't buy..........,"bought this watch in August or September 2008 and then the Indiglo flex light stopped working in October. Sucks cuz I am in Iraq and it is always dark here, so it seems. Now I have to buy another watch...."
1,Loved it for 3 yrs until had to change battery,"I loved this watch. Very rugged, and I am outside in water and very active. Great watch until battery went out. You cannot put in a new battery unless you tear up the plastic because you cannot put the back on it after taking it off. Even the lady at the store said this style was a pain to get the back of the watch back on. This is about my 5th Ironman, but it is a terrible design. Timex should be ashamed of this product."
1,ironman timex watch,"I ordered the watch for someone as a gift. I thought it was a good buy for $50.00 with the shipping included, then I saw the exact same watch in Target for $25.oo. I am mad!"
4,Swiss army knife of watches,"Basically, whatever you need a watch for, this does it and does it easily. I've noted that the fifth button really makes it easier to use all the functions on a watch, and the functions on this watch seem intuitively arranged. I'm going to read the manual someday but I haven't yet.The overall color scheme is actually very sharp looking, better in person than the picture. But, yes, its a big boy - more like a fat boy. It took me a couple of days to get used to it. But hey I'm a big boy too so it looks fine on me. In addition to the shock absorption, the bigger size also buys you total waterproofing even when the buttons are pushed under water.I will say though that while the black face and white numerals look cool, they are a bit harder to read. Readability is fine in fairly bright light and when you need the backlight, but in other light you may need to take a closer look."
5,Great Watch,"This is a great watch. It is accurate, as you would expect, good looking and easy to set up and use. It has many features I do not use like keeping golf scores, but for running, it works really well. I especially like the band, which is stronger than ones I have had. I tend to be hard on watches and this one stands up to the test."
4,good,"I bought several times on this website and the truth that the quality of their prices is good, the price is very good and the attention to the customer is good, for he who seeks anything Informatica, appliances, toys, video games , and even jewelry, very nice by the way, I recommend this website"
5,Excellent watch for the money,"Paid a great price (just $39) for this watch. Good looking, great color combo (especially if you're a SF Giants or Detroit Tigers fan) too. It's been very durable. I use it on workouts, runs, and it takes a beating. Never even bothered to look at the manual, as it's pretty easy to figure out all the functions.Pros:StylishIntuitive, easy to use controlsCons:Could be a little on the heavy side when running for longer distances"
3,A good watch for the money,"The Good: This watch is very fuctional with a big readout. I found it easy to use.The Bad: It's hard to read in direct light and light itself is pretty dim. My biggest gripe with this watch is the band. The little ""loop"" that the excess band goes into has a big notch in it that secures it to the band. That's good for keeping it in place while exercising, but in the beginning I had issues removing it. Felt like I was always going to break it. Found out if you squeeze the sides of the loop it releases the pressure and makes it easier to remove.What I would have done differently: The blue is a lighter metallic blue than I anticipated - I would buy this watch in silver if I had a ""do over."""
1,broken quickly,"It broke within one day. The stopwatch feature does not work now. I have had luck with Timex's in the past, but the last two have been terrible. I will try another brand next time."
1,Very Unsatisfied,Was not impressed with the pan at all-it is not a 12 inch but only 11 1/4 - the quality isn't worth the money-sent mine back and order the mill.farberware 12 inch that I had before.
1,Finish was sketchy,The finish on the pan was not applied evenly and it looked already worn in some areas. I sent mine back.
4,Nice Product,I bought this fry pan for my mom.....and she loves it. Easy to cook with and easy clean up.......and she should know.....she's been cooking for 70 years !!
1,MERDE!!!,"Vive la musique pour le $$$, vive la télé réalité! Cé a la vraie vie, le monde parfait, la raison de vivre. Merci. Non mais sérieusement, dire que des arbres sont coupés pour imprimmer cette MERDE!"
1,Invitation au personne n'aimant pas le fife de Wilfred,J'invite tout le monde qui n'aime pas Wilfred et sa bande de cave à pirater son disque et à l'envoyer à Julie Snyder ou à Quebecor média avec comme titre pirater la musique poche !!!Plus de place pour les VRAIS artistes !!!!!!
5,MacBeth as a horror movie,"From the first moments of this inspired re-imagining of Shakespeare the viewer is gripped by the creepiness of the tale. I can't help thinking Shakespeare would approve and applaud this interpretation. It is very disturbing and at times you'd think you were watching something like Saw. The witches were especially creepy, and were utilized in scenes where they'd normally not be included. My only complaint is that it should've included the Paula Zahn interview that was available at the Great Performances website. Patrick Stewart remarks on how scary his co-star was, and she was nearly a vampire in this. It remains true to the original text, and is not simply using the story as in many modern adaptations. Everyone in the cast is excellent, though I had trouble understanding the insolence of the porter. I suspect this MacBeth is not for everyone."
3,Macbeth DVD Patrick Stewart,"Patrick Stewart is a consummate actor, especially when performing in Shakepeare's plays. His Macbeth is riveting, intense, and pleasing. When he speaks Shakespeare's words, the audience can follow them easily. Great contemporary version of the play Macbeth."
3,"I was looking for this in play format, but this version wasn't bad","This version of Macbeth wasn't bad, it did go along way toward making it a lot more comprehensive, it is shakespear after all. But all of the actors were outstanding, worth seeing just for the talent!"
3,Unsure why others rated it so highly,"If you have Amazon Prime you can easily flip between this adaptation and the BBC's every few minutes (Prime lets you play 2 videos at once). If you have the RSC DVD you can flip between the 3 of them. You will be able to judge what works and what does not work in each of the 3 adaptations very quickly and quite easily.I'm also a bit surprised with the discussion on ""time displacement."" I have seen it as far back as I can remember. IMHO it neither adds to nor detracts from the play. Still, bad(good) choices are bad(good) choices in any century.Do the comparison above if you have the chance."
2,What's Going On Here???,"Macbeth is a 5 star script, but the movie is 1 star at best; hence the 2 star rating. It's impossible to tell what the director had in mind. Montages from battle, subway scenes, references to communist regimes, some kind of weird Russian dancing...a skinny, scary Lady Macbeth, robot nurse-witches (who do a sort of satanic rap) , a manic-depressive Porter...I am usually a fan of Patrick Stewart, but he got himself into a nightmare here. I feel like I need to wash my eyes with acid."
2,Painful to watch,Sorry guys. Patrick Stewart can't keep this movie alive. It's overwrought and overdone. The actors are stiff and lifeless. They read their lines as if on tranquilizers. I've seen worse adaptations but not much worse.
4,MACBETH,THE ACTING IS VERY INTENSE AND PATRICK STEWART WAS MADE TO BE THE TORMENTED MACBETH. SIR PATRICK DOES AN EXCEPTIONAL ACTING PERFORMANCE. THE STORY IS WELL TOLD AND I LOVE THE UPDATED VERSION OF MACBETH THAT THE ACTORS GIVE US.
2,Had high hopes!,"I was really looking for an appropriate production of Macbeth that I could show to my senior English class; one that stayed true to Shakespeare's play and kept the attention of my students. Talk about weird... this certainly held the attention of a group of 17 & 18 year-olds, but not in the way that I had hoped. It was strange and had several inappropriate scenes. It is very frustrating as an English teacher to not be able to show what should be a classic, but is instead turned into... a horror film??? Actually, I'm not sure what this production is supposed to be. Maybe I am a little too traditional, but come on!!!"
5,remarkable,Brilliantly executed. The transposition of Mcbeth to the Stalinist purges is chilling. Well done.
5,Brilliant.,Saw this on PBS and WOW- just a brilliant adaption. Stewart does not disappoint. Best thing I've seen through a TV in ten years.
5,Such a fair and foul Macbeth I have not seen!,"Steward is an anchor; he delivers on taking us with him into madness. Fleetwood gives us a dynamic performance, beginning as a sultry temptress (an aspect too often neglected), shakespeare's evil Eve, with all the relentlessness of a Richard III; as her mind is mangled she becomes less and less creative and active until she falls into a frigid nightmare, a perfectly ""poor player,"" a ""walking shadow."" The witches are too uncanny for description, they need to be experienced...they are truly the stuff of nightmares!"
4,King of the Plushes!,"Got this as a gift for my lady last Christmas and it's fantastic.I mean it's hard to write a review for a stuffed animal, but here goes.The build quality is very impressive on this little guy. Unlike a lot of TY Beanie Babies, King Ghidorah is stuffed nice and plump. This give him alot of rigidity, which makes display easy. He stands on his own and his heads don't fall over.All the detail work is really nice. The wings are patterned and his eyes have little pupils.All in all a top notch plush. The only thing that would make it better would be a voice box so I could hear him roar."
5,Ghaddorah Rocks,My plush King Ghaddorah and plush Godzilla sleep in my bed and I play with them before I fall asleep. I make up battle scenes for the next day.
5,godzilla fanatic,"my 4 year old, like his father, is a godzilla fan...he loves this toy, I also got him the Godzilla plush one and he keeps them both in his bed."
4,"A useful book, though some fat could be trimmed.","This book is an excellent resource for any writer, professional or not. It gives insight into audience, word selection, and proper (his interpretation) style of writing. Learn the conventions so that when it comes down to breaking them, you will do so KNOWING it, instead of accidentally doing so.That said, the placement of the graphics was odd, almost never fitting on the page in which they are used to illustrate the point and causing more work for the casual reader. Much of his point goes beyond making it and into flogging it.That said, the book is darn useful, and will continue to be so for a while. It's timely and fashionable."
4,He should practice his Second Great Law.,"In his Second Great Law, Herschell Gordon Lewis comments that cleverness for its own sake might become a liability. Unfortunately, he attempts to write with cleverness and sarcasm. His style often gets in the way of the excellent points he makes. The points need no ""I'm-as-hip-as-thou"" embellishment. Chapters 26-28 are worth the price of the book alone. But he runs out of steam in the appendix. It truly is vestigial. In spite of his writing style the book is a must read."
1,"You no longer have to look up the word ""didactic.""","I'll admit to being a little suspicious when I saw the precious title on Amazon, and chose not to order this. But someone on staff (we are the Children's Department of a public library serving about 50,000) did. We are all sorry.The songs are dreadful. The ""rhymes"" often don't. The meter is appalling. And with obvious, hit on the head lessons, we have all the force and application of a morality play.If this were a parody, I would laugh, but the fact is that new librarians will actually try to use it! I can't imagine a more effective way to make a young person loathe the library than to make the poor thing sing, ""I am a non-non-non-non-fiction book book book with lots of facts facts facts...""Any (well, almost any) children's song book will be of more use than this self-concious and desperate attempt at cuteness."
4,Having the Beginner's Book Helps,"I used the ""Teach Yourself: Beginner's French"" book and cassettes first, which made it easier to use this more complex follow-up book. I think this is what made this book easier to follow, given the complaints others have listed in their reviews. I think the two should be used in conjunction, and I am satisfied with the results, although I credit some of that satisfaction to having already been exposed to a Romance language, Spanish. Overall, I think this book is worth the money, considering how expensive many other learn-at-home programs can be."
5,impressed,i have to say of all the jewelry purchased over the years sabrina silver has the highest quality for the price!!!!!
4,Very Nice,"I ordered this thinking I might not like it after I got it. When it arrived today, I was very pleased. The fit was perfect and it looks great!"
4,double trouble,great book about twins who get to be groupies for a weekend when a teen singer comes to townbut things didn't quite turn out as aspected.fun reading for young readers. happy reading!
2,Rehash from the 70's....,"Richard Winer is best known as the author of the Devil's Triangle books in the Devil's/Bermuda Triangle craze in the 1970's. You may be wondering how this relates to this ""new"" book. Basically this is the story of a publisher who has 3 old Devil's Triangle books sitting in their vaults gathering dust....So how about combining stories from the three books, throwing a new title on it and seeing how much money they can rake in. And that's pretty much what you have here. The stories vary in quality ( just as the original books did ). If you like ocean mysteries it may be worth a look."
3,A hit and miss affair,"Well I'm sitting on the fence on this one. The subject matter is appealing to me but the manner in which it was written coupled with the research (or lack thereof), enabled me to knock a couple of stars off.Critics would say that Winer has pulled out some old manuscripts from his office drawer, dusted them off and re-submitted them as a new book. At times, that seems pretty close to the truth. Nevertheless, some of the stories Winer writes about are interesting.This book blows hot and cold. Buy it and enjoy the hot spots."
5,Easy to the ear,"I am the type of person who rarely buys music CD.. like many I download them.... and so I did for Massari...and since I liked all of the songs.. I decided to buy the cd,, to support him. his music is very nice and pleasant to ear ..can't go wrong with this cd.. very nice songs"
5,Buy this Pedal!,"Great deal. Instead of buying a new amp with more high end, I bought this $60 pedal instead. It has allowed me to use ALL my guitars instead of just those that give me a higher end. You can sculpt your sound radically, or very subtly. I Put the EQ after my other pedals & before the amp. The pedal is more responsive that way. you can also use it as a boost (eq levels above zero). I notched up the high end so when I hit the button I get a nice sparkle for solos. My clean channel on my amp did not have enough treble. It is a great amp with this one deficiency. That problem has been solved with this pedal. It's not glamorous, but it's the best pedal investment I've ever made. The pedal is small, rugged, & the lighted faders are cool. Cheers!"
5,Great pedal very musical,"I have been disappointed with the last EQ pedal I owned witch was a Boss GE7, it was very honkey and colored my tone to much, this pedal is much more musical the layout of the essential frequency's is great, plus they are lighted and very ez to see. and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and will last for ever"
3,Not what I wanted,"This thing is so noisy I sentit back. TheThey returned it the EXACT same way- the tech told meThat if you raise any of the frequencies past ""0"" it will be noisy- so best use is to remove what you don't want rather than add what you do want. Wish Dunlop had said that in their product description."
3,"Works well with some equipment. Other equipment, not as much.","Bought this on a whim. It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion. When used with a pedalboard rig, it doesn't add much except for hiss, unfortunately. Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit, though. Does not sound good with updated equipment, Line 6 equipment, Roland units. I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head. Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal. It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar, amp, wah, and guitar, or amp, wah, guitar, and expression pedal. Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out, though. Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player, but good for beginners and intermediate levels. Into King Crimson/Fripp styles? Don't go for this for modeling."
4,A decent sample of radio drama from the '40s and early '50s,"This collection showcases a range of different radio programs, from comedy to mystery and suspense to westerns and sci-fi. Some of these shows were just okay, but others were better---for example, Jack Benny was better than Burns and Allen, The Lone Ranger was better than The Green Hornet, and Suspense was better than Escape. Other highlights are the Dragnet and X-Minus One episodes. Also featured here are The Whistler and Inner Sanctum Mysteries. A bit of a mixed bag, but on the whole a fairly entertaining ten hours of listening. Three and a half stars."
1,disgraceful...,"as much as I appreciate The Residents, this has to be one of their worst albums.. probably the second worst (that honor for first goes to Big Bubble).. The Gershwin side is ok.. next to the James Brown side, it is almost reverential. The James Brown side is horrendous-- it is just plain bad, and I will venture to say that it is bordering on racist."
3,Interesting but clinical,"The Gershwin tracks are minimalist deconstructions sounding a bit clinical although they have their eerie phases. The James tracks have their amusing moments, especially in the audience participation and I suppose they go a long way to deconstructing James Brown' legendary Live At The Apollo set, but of course it lacks soulfulness, thereby completely missing out on the point of James Brown's music. The structure is there, but it's like a mere skeleton without the flesh of the soul, with the possible exception of Night Train which is quite rousing. I can't imagine this music having anything but an intellectual appeal. Rather give me The Residents with Snakefinger doing their own stuff!"
2,The Resident's Miss Their Mark,"It is unfortunate that such a good idea as the Residents doing reworking of other's music did not work out any better than the first few cuts of the Stars and Hank recording. This recording, like Stars and Hank, was originally released as a plastic LP with one side being the George Gershwin and the other a reworking of the James Brown ""Live at the Apollo"".It starts out promising enough, with an air siren melding into the first few notes of George Gershwin's masterpiece ""Rhapsody in Blue"" (a decent job by the Residents). Unfortunately, the rest of the Gershwin works pale quickly.The James Brown side is amusing, for a bit... but never quite makes it as a decent parody of the works of that troubled artist.Two stars, but not recommended."
4,Quick and Delightful to Read,"I finished this book in a day. It was entertaining and amusing, not requiring a lot of deep thought. I thought Fforde did a fairly good job of character development even if the plot was a tad predictableI liked the way the family was presented with all of its faults: the disagreements, the messiness, the lack of planned meals. This was very realistic. I also liked the way Althea met her financial problems head-on and made the best of things.The only false note was the way Althea treated Patrick....there were too many times when she decided to let him go and pushed him out of her life.But overall, this was an enjoyable way to spend a day of reading."
5,Katie Fforde produces a REAL PAGE TURNER...,"then, towards the end, you realize you've been racing through this story, and oh, no ... it's going to end soon, and you JUST DON'T WANT IT TO. Our heroine is NOT your typical mom; she's much too involved in her kids; perhaps that is why they're so likeable, and you wish they were your own? And the messes she gets herself into, couldn't possibly happen in real life; perhaps that's why you find yourself laughing out loud so often. A light hearted, fun, read-it-in-one day novel. Katie Fford is a new favorite author!"
2,Not particulary interesting,"I wasn't sure what to expect being that this was my first novel about the modern England. I guess I just am left feeling let-down. I was not drawn into the story at all. In fact, I found the plot a little too predicitible. I also felt that Althea worried too much about her kids for almost half of the book. No real person worries that much and pushes off the man as many times as she did. I couldn't quite understand why Patrick kept coming back to her. It is a good book to read if you just want something for here and there, but don't waste your time if you want to get into the book and the characters. I found myself having to put the book down because I was feeling ""bogged"" down with reading it. I did finish the book, which does say that it has some redeaming qualities, but there are not many."
5,satisfying read,A thoroughly satisfying introduction to an author I intend to read further. Shades of Joanna Trollope in Fford's astute depictions of real families' ups and downs.
3,"Not Bad, but Life Skills is Better","I found this Katie Fforde to be the second best of her works, full of enjoyable details about gardening in England and the Chelsea Flower Show, all expressed in Fforde's delightful, slangy modern British diction. Unfortunately, one soon tires of Fforde's self-centered and in this case unnecessarily martyered female characters and wonders why the men they keep pushing away come back for more. This results in predictable endings as well because one knows from the start that the women will come to their senses in the end and marry."
2,Happy ending but tedious and too tidy,"It started off interesting enough - but it seemed a bit unrealistic: Althena pushing off an attractive and honest suitor for the upteenth time, Althena being such a matron/martyr that she comes off frumpy but has extremely attractive men pursue her, Althena's kids that seem so good-natured about everything, and finally Althena getting the guy (as you know she would from the beginning) and it all being much too pat and perfect. I lost patience with it mid-way, and then I realized that I would have preferred a re-read of Pride and Prejudice instead."
5,TRULY- A MASTERWORK OF MODERN LIVING SCRIPTURE.,"I have enjoyed many noteable works of great inspiration, but reading ""God Talks With Arjuna"", was literally a breathtaking experience. Not just another Gita commentary - this work contains many original spiritual insights and practical, balanced, religious approaches to life that are desparately needed in to-days world. But most of all, PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA was a Living Example of that ideal Christlike perfection as taught in the Gita and has inspired millions with his ""Autobiography of a Yogi"". A rewarding in depth revelation awaits any serious, sincere seeker of truth. Especially recommended for the serious religious scholar and devotee. If you have not yet found a satisfying answers to lifes most profound questions, this would be a good place to find clear, simple, practical, spiritual direction and understanding. A complete reference book for living the Spiritual Life and guiding your journey to Self-Realization."
5,"A Humbled Reader from East Quogue, L.I., New York","After reading ""Autobiography of a Yogi"", ""The Holy Science"" and other Self-Realization Fellowship books and pamphlets, I thought I was given the ""complete"" treasure-trove of The Truth. Wrong! ""God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita"" is the most detailed and truthful book on creation, life and ""death"" that I have ever read! It strikes a solid chord within and doesn't let go! Not only that, but it seems to ""coincidentally"" answer questions that just happen to present themselves in my daily life at just the right moment. It is not an easy read, but in the words of the Great Illumined Master Yogananda, ""...the charcoal does not burn red by itself"". Don't waste another second--read it now!"
4,Spiritual warriors on the battelfield of daily life,"Yoganandas purports are great insights in the souls struggel for enlightenment. He takes the Bhagavad Gita as a symbolic description of inner forces of human life: the field of Kurukshetra is the human body, the Pandavas are representing the functions of the different chakras and Krishna is the divine aspect of the soul. Yoganandas explanations are generally based on Kriya Yoga."
2,Poetry of the Gita broken up by the commentary.,"This is not to knock this version for those who are yearning for a paragraph of commentary following every line or two of the Text, and DEFINITELY not to knock the Gita itself. But I would think that the commentaries would come at the end of the chapters or on the facing pages, so I could enjoy and relish Yogananda's own translation (maybe his organization will come out with his straight translation, no commentary). But for the shear beauty of the poetic translation of the Gita itself, I love the version of Eknath Easwaran (I confess to owning and loving most of his books, and especially love his Upanishads for the same reason)."
1,Not my cup of tea,"Judging by all the positive reviews, I wonder if I'm not getting it. I was first exposed to the gita when I was a teenager and it spoke to my heart. The best analogy I could use to describe these books would be if you took a butterfly and looked at it under a microscope. You get to close to see the beauty. Instead I would recommend the translation's by Swami Prabhavananda, Eknath Easwaran, or even Juan Mascaro."
4,Recieved in good time and book was in good condition.,Recieved in good time and book was in good condition.
5,The Best Book on Successful Business,"I received Zero to One Million a few days ago - it was awesome. I spent the better part of the night (when I was supposed to be sleeping) reading it. I was doing the old flashlight under the covers trick since I had to be up at 6:00 the next morning for school, and mom would have sent me to bed had she known. No matter - I felt it was good preparation (after reading your 'day in the life of an entrepreneur) for me becoming an entrepreneur. I really wanted to thank you for that book and let you know that you have made a difference in one life. All books I had read previously (Kiyosaki, Robert G Allen) while containing good information had left me still a little confused as to where I was going. After reading your book, there was no doubt in my mind. I am going to be an entrepreneur - and a successful one. I really liked your book's down-to-earth style with practical examples. Thanks a million (pun intended)."
1,"Overall, a pretty horrible book","Business books of the personal finance ""genre"" are pretty bad to begin with. Most don't give any information other than which is only common sense. Suze Orman's books, for instance. This book, essentially, doesn't do anything new. It chronicles one 19 year old's ""rise"" to success. This kid doesn't have the inside information. If I (20 years of age) were to give you advice on how to succeed in business today, you probably wouldn't listen to me, let alone give me 15 bucks to give it to you in book form. There's absolutely no reason to spend money on this. My Business advice, Mr. Allis, save the money you're making on this venture and spend it trying to get stains out of your futon."
5,Loved this sweet little baby of a book!,"This was one of the sweetest, most lovable books I have ever read! The photos and quotes worked so well together and really made me ponder the wonders of babies and the joy they bring us. I'm planning on giving this to all my friends and families with babies. Finally, something to give new grandparents, aunts, uncles... anyone who loves babies! This book is such a simple, yet profound look at the wisdom in babies, not to mention filled with beautiful photos of the magic they bring to our lives! It charms me every time I open it, I completely recommend it, I'm sure it will bring everyone the same twinkly smile it brought me."
3,what women from the 60's had for career choices and what hap,I enjoyed seeing what the carrer choices were for smart women of the 60's and how they now feel about what they did with life. It was a view into the past with hope for the future
1,Horrible! Don't Buy It!,I bought this and started to put it together. The material it is made out of is very cheap. A lot of the pieces had bends/creases in them and some of them would break (a chunk would break off) when trying to connect to another piece. The overall picture looks cheap up close. I ended up throwing it away!
3,Its a cable...,"Wow, what a wonderful... cable. Good price and it works well. Its in a permanent installation so it doesn't get moved around. I'm guessing it would work fine anyway."
1,Only half on track,"Anyone looking for an authoritative book on Bin Laden would do better to consult either of Peter Bergen's works, or Rohan Gunaratna. While many of the details in Bodansky's book are plausible, and even correspond with those of other authors, no footnotes are given throughout, and many details (such as Al Qaeda's possession of nuclear weapons) are highly suspect if not patently false. Bodansky portray's Bin Laden as largely a state-sponsored terrorist, and I think he fails utterly to show the grass roots genesis of Islamist resistance. In fact, most of the book isn't even on Bin Laden, save one chapter, and deals with background events of Islamist terrorism. Most damaging is Bodansky's failure to be transparent about his sources and convincing about his facts. A critical reader should suspect an agenda or ideological lens in this work that is absent from Bergen and Gunaratna."
1,"Bin Laden, The Man Who Delcared War on America","I'm sorry I was forced to give this book one star--it deserves none. This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. Many other reviewers have commented on the bias, lack of footnotes for assertions which are incredible, nonexistent order and coherence in the story, and the many other faults. I wish I had read these reviews before I reccommended this book for my book club. I may lose my membership over this one."
1,Unreliable,"Several books have now been published on Bin Laden. I have read a number of them. Bodansky's book is - unfortunately - among the worst ones, and I feel frightened to see how people rate it positively. Bodansky's book primarily consists of unproved allegations. It is easy for him to do that, since everything supposedly comes from ""intelligence"" sources which he cannot disclose, etc. But people with some knowledge of the topic soon realize that it is a mixture of accurate information and mere allegations. ... I would much more recommend Bergen's book, for instance - another early book on Bin Laden. Gunaratna's book is also significantly better, although it does not entirely escape criticism"
1,False Colors,"I purchased this book because of an opening excerpt available at Amazon.com, which was well written and informative. The book as a whole however is untrustworthy. One comes upon this realization as a reader given the fact there are no sources cited. At the same time the author writes as if he had been present at all sorts of terrorist confabs. One example that took the cake for me was the description of a meeting between Saddam Hussein and his two sons. My sense was also that Arabic newspapers and Islamist organizations have been quoted out of context; the quotes are partial and limited, and a reader realizes these quotes could have been part of an explanation of terrorist acts, not an endorsement of them, as the author states or implies."
2,UBL: The man who declared war on America,"I found some of the reviews to be quite accurate. In my field this book was ""required reading"". I found it difficult, long-winded and most important....not factual! Some glaring inaccuracies such as the explosion of flight 800 off Long Island... I found Bodansky had a penchant for a cut and paste style writing when it came to Arab newspaper editorials. He included many! He also went into fine detail about meetings involving Bin Laden and many of the Islamic terrorists known leaders. Although sometimes accurate.....Many times not!! He also assumed the purpose of these meetings, which did not always reflect the truth..."
1,Tom Clancy Where Are You?,"Save your time & money, this book is neither fact nor fiction.A tatal waste."
1,unreliable,"There are an incredible number of broad statements that leave the reader gasping at the audacity of the writer. A host of assertions are difficult. For instance, no other source agrees that Saddam Hussein's son participated in Al Queda's ""work"" anywhere but there is a statement to that effect in this book given without any citation or sources. We are in trouble if this sort of work is the basis for any counter to jihadists."
2,Decent read on face value,"I've owned this book since it first was published in '99. The book reads well with the excepetion of a few boring parts. For the most part, Bodansky gives the straight facts about bin Laden and definately covers his history in depth. My only real complaint is the anti-bin Laden spin Bodansky puts on his writing. Some chapters seemed to carry a little too much of his personal agenda with them. Bottom line: take this book on its face value and ignore the [personal] input."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing if you are looking for information on the man himself and his way of thinking. The author loses his focus on the man from the first pages of the book. The title of the book was misleading. The best book I read so far on Bin Laden is from Kirk Fianzcanna and is called ""Bin Laden by Bin Laden - In His Own Words""."
4,This guy dares to let you have fun at the concert hall,"Imagine Varese refusing to take himself seriously. Or imagine Carl Stalling writing for concert halls instead of for WB cartoons. This guy's music is the antidote to the dry academic layer of dust that coats most modern classical composition. This music is about having fun. It's raucous and noisy, even in a chamber setting. He makes sopranos squeak like mice; performers with touchy egos probably can't perform his stuff at all. I think he's now my favorite living composer."
2,not for gaming!,"I've had this card awhile and i can tell you, the only game to get acceptable gaming performance is thru a 7800gtx. If you're short on money, buy a 6800! its faster and a better deal.I only hit about 35fps on HL2, an appalling 14 on COD2, and only 24fps on FEAR. The only good thing about this card that i can think of is that it is dirt cheap. But, like i said, if you're thinking of upgrading, buy at least a 6800, because this card just can't keep up."
2,Not happy,"I am rating a MONROE calculator 8130 model, as this was sent instead of the model 7130 by Ace Depot, LLC I ordered through Amazon.com on 8/11/2011. Two months of light use and the number display has a ""ghost"" display of the same number you enter. We called MONROE to see if there was some technical issue to resolve this but it must be sent back. We inquired of Ace Depot if they stood behind their sale and were told only for 30 days. MONROE was notified and we are in the process of sending it back for repair.Anyone dealing with Ace Depot, LLC should have this information before purchasing. MONROE calculators have had a great track record but I am not happy with this Model 8130."
2,Broken right out of the box,"I'm giving this 2 stars at the moment because I can't tell you how it worked -- right out of the box it was broken; when I turn it on it turns itself off within 6 or 7 seconds. Very frustrating, because after waiting for it to be delivered I have to now wait for the return to make it back, then the new one to be delivered.This doesn't bode well. Has Sony become the latest company to follow Mercedes into unreliable territory? Has anyone else had this problem?"
2,I am still undecided,"I bought this DVD Player/Recorder thinking I would be able to burn DVDs or have the option of creating a VHS of over 100 Hi 8 tapes (non digital). I connected my hi 8 camcorder and used the line 2 jacks on the front of the Sony DVD RDR-VX500 machine. I wanted to do partial recording of scenes on about 3 different hi 8 tapes and burn then on a DVD RW+ or a DVD RW- (I tried both). Then I wanted to take a few scenes from a few other VHS tape and burn them to the same DVD to have all the scenes I wanted from my HI 8 tapes plus those on a few WHS tapes on the same DVD But I don't seem to be able to do so. I then was going to load the DVD on my SONY laptop and then do some Digital Editing using Photoshop Premier editing.I may be screwing up in the finalizing process or even the recording process itself but I seem to be able to get parts of the Hi 8 tapes to transfer to the DVD , but not all, and I can't seem to get BOTH Hi 8 tapes and VHS to transfer to the SAME DVD[...]"
2,No Upgrade to use 16x DVD-R/+R media!,"Save your money!This thing only writes to 8X speed disks AND SLOWER!Not faster!I have 400+ DVD-R disks in my house now that this thing will not see.Sure - in the manual on page 10 it says blah-blah speed or slower, but please! no accounting for faster media tecnology?Come on!I have had this thing for about 18 months (obsolete?) and 8x disks are VERY HARD to find. They are all 16x now.Sony, what were you thinking!?! ~$400 paid! BOHICA.Buy a Panasonic."
3,Okay as a player but not as a recorder,"I have had sporadic results with dubbing, especially with trying to dub from DVD to VHS. I follow the user manual step for step, and yet nine times out of ten I cannot get the dubbing to start.Not a good product."
2,DVD recorder is unreliable,"I have been having trouble with the dvd recorder aspect since the first year I bought it. It made loud clunky noises during finalization, and then about half the time lost the data. I used the warranty and sent it in to be fixed. A couple months later, the recorder was unreliable again.Now the warranty is expired, and I just lost all the data of a program I spent 3 hours recording (and won't be airing again). I've had it. This dvd recorder/ vcr combo is out.Note I gave it two stars because the dvd player and vcr player work."
3,Could be better,"The RDR-VX500 recorded flawlessly when I used the SP or HQ record modes; however, when I wanted to fit more than 2 hours onto the DVD and used LP or EP mode, the image played back as a DOUBLE IMAGE. I returned the machine, tried it again, and it happened again."
3,"What are you talking about, Michael?","I did exactly as you suggested...went to Google and did a search on sony ch:13. I didn't find one bad thing about this unit in the first three pages of the search results and stopped looking after that.Epinions show that of about 10 buyers, 76% gave the machine a thumbs up and 22% give the unit a thumbs down. If you look at the ratings of all the recordable DVD/VCR units, you will find that is at the higher end of approval ratings."
1,Need a Zero Star Option for this one.,I have a complete sony AV system from over ten years ago that is rock solid and performs as well today as when I bought it. So when a standalone DVD burner dropped below $500 (and a Sony!) I bought it.This was a terrible mistake.Pros:Component output from DVD.Cons:Slow to open disk tray (over 15 seconds - annoying).Won't play most DVD-R backups.Won't play back recordings made on it!Front panel 'one touch' Tape->DVD works intermittantly.Off white 'sticker' on front actually embedded on front.Freezes at specific points on certain disks - disks that play fine in three other players!Bought a Toshiba big screen - done with Sony for a while...
1,Sony could do better,"This unit is not one of Sony's best efforts. The one pro I can identify is the easy one-touch recording. It seems to work jsut fine. The cons are fairly significant for one of the more pricey VCR/DVD recorder combos. The menuing system is clunky by today's standards and does not meet the expectations of a Sony product. The worst of the problems is the VCR unit does a very very poor job of playback. I have tried both home recorded and purchased tapes and they do not track properly. So the glitches and jitters show up on the recorded DVD. I have tried adjusting the tracking, but it does not help. I will be exchanging my unit for another brand."
3,Dubbing Creates Interference get an A/B Switch,"The Sony RDR-VX500 has one serious fault. It offers one touch dubbing but if you dub while watching TV your picture will be interfered with by ""Snow"". Sony technical says yes that is how they ""designed"" it. If you intend to dub you cannot watch TV too. There are only three solutions. One, crawl behind your TV and unhook the RDR-VX500 input co-axial cable and connect it directly to the TV everytime you dub something. Two, buy an A/B switch and run the cable co-axial input into it and use the switch to select TV or send the signal to the RDR-VX500. Sony was too cheap to include an A/B switch. Three, return it and try another manufacturer."
3,It's OK but I couldn't finish it.,"I bought this book because I have liked some other stories Jane Ashford wrote. She does write well, wonderful similes, but all the elegant prose in the world will not make an unbelievable story better."
5,Era respiration-byte:,"""Abnormal living body-Joe Coleman controlls the drug fetus's guerrilla=sex brain and thinks about the psychedelic anus of a chemical=anthropoid with the era respiration-byte."" - Kenji Siratori, author of Blood Electric"
5,Fantastic,If u are looking for rare oldies this is it. Very good selection of songs. Really opened me up to songs i've never heard. love it
3,Ok book,This book was okay. Its about two brothers Tom and Dylan. Tom is popular and Dylan is not. Dylan takes it out on Tom trys to start a fight with him one day in the cafeteria. Tom is nice to Dylan but Dylan is not very nice back. When Elizabeth discovers Dylan is going to run away can she stop him before its too late?
3,Not the Dylan McKay from 90210,"Dylan is unpopular and geeky while his brother Tom is handsome and funny and popular.Dylan is becoming so jealous of Tom that he even lashes out at him,physically.HE gets more and more angry and snubs everyone who talks to him.He feels so inferior to Tom and it's killing him inside.When he is not invited to a party it is the final straw and he decides to run away.It is Sweet VAlleys own guardian angel,Elizabeth,who may be able to help him."
5,Good history for breaking the sound barrier,Lots of small bits of information that were here-to-fore unknown but very informative. Great with the details and technical information and a super addition to my library
1,Confusing; not enjoyable,Writing is awful its like having the cart before the horse. Confusing--either stick to the name or the persons nickname. It felt like having Mexican jumping beans in your pocket or something. Didn't even finish it.
3,Telluric - but this premiere recording is not a first choice,"See my review under the disc's other entry on this website:Birtwistle: Earth Dances(where you might also find it cheaper). This version by the BBC SO under Peter Eötvös was the composition's premiere recording. There have been others since: Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra (Earth Dances/Panic), paired with ""Panic"" (a saxophone concerto), now reissued on a convenient two-CD set from Decca's British Music Collection (The British Music Collection: Harrison Birtwistle), and Boulez and Ensemble Modern Orchestra, on DG's 20/21 collection, paired with Theseus Game (Birtwistle: Theseus Game, Earth Dances). I have Dohnanyi: it comes in much more present and vivid sonics and the orchestra has an extra bite which, added to its availability, makes it a better choice."
5,Humidor seasoning,A perfect product for humidor seasoning and a great seller. I recommend the seller and the product for your cigar needs.
2,A waste of time and money,"I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews. I bought these to season my humidor. After seven days the relative humidity had gone from 40% to 44%. I know the instructions say to wait 14 days but a 4% increase in 7 days is pretty slow. I don't think it would ever get to 84%. I bought some distilled water and seasoned it the old fashioned way by wiping it down, leaving the sponge in the box for a day and wetting the humidifier with a 50/50 mix of polypropylene glycol and water. The RH went to 52% before I even closed the box. Next day remove the sponge, wipe it down again with distilled water, wait another day and your ready to add the cigars."
3,Many good reviews,"This product has many good reviews, but my experience was not that great. This mat be due to my own impatience. I removed the product after 10 days of 50% humidity. Many reviewers have had good luck with these but I will stick with the traditional seasoning meathodes."
2,14 days to season your humidor!,It funny the item description doesn't mention the 14 day seasoning process as compared to the traditional 2 - 3 day wipe down process with distilled water. 14 days!?! Come on!......oh I'm an impatient person. lol I threw my packets away and wiped down with water. I see this as a waste of money. Just another gadget for those wanting to simplify an already very simple process. They got me. Grrrrr!
2,Not getting the job done,"Didn't seem to help my humidor. Can't seem to get the humidity stable. It seems pretty easy to use, but then again maybe I did it wrong. A bunch of products with lousy documentation."
2,Didn't get near the promised humidity,I used two of these as recommended for seasoning to 84% humidity a 50 cigar humidor and after two weeks with nothing else inside the humidity never got over 73% as measured by two hygrometers.
2,Voodoo that doesn't work,"I don't think these packets do any good. Maybe it is my hygrometer, but I don't see these packets holding humidity levels. I have found that a shot glass of distilled water works much better. I do not plan to buy again."
3,There Are Three Guys In This Band,"Singer/songwriter Myles Kennedy has a great voice. Too bad it sounds a hell of a lot like Chris Cornell's. This middle of the road rock album has its moments but suffers from copycat syndrome. ""Loose Cannon"" sounds like Soungarden and the power ballad ""Eden"" is a ringer for Collective Soul. Luckily for Kennedy, the songs here are strong enough to overcome their originality deficiency. Zeppelin is referenced both in ""Lyla"" and the Kashmir-like ""White Flag."" Kennedy's voice range is also apparent in the latter, reaching, at times, Geoff Tate(Queensryche) heights. Only on a couple of slower number does this album falter, sounding like bad top 40. Without them, Second Skin could have been a lot better than average"

1,Alter Bridge I think not.,"I got this one in the mail about a week or two ago. I bought it after hearing a few Alter Bridge songs, the best of which was Metalingus. Myles Kennedy has an absolutely fantastic voice. BUT, it seems to me he wastes it in this band with these no-talent panzies who can't even play decent music. I'm not a BIG Alter Bridge fan, i just think they're not bad, there's a couple of songs on there that made me want to buy this in hopes it would be better, but in fact it is MUCH worse. Basically don't buy this if you like Alter Bridge, you'll be horrible dissapointed. A little too radio-friendly rock, which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so darned boring and not catchy in the least. And as for the guy who says the guitars are more distorted than ever and the riffs are chunkier, you sir, are an idiot. There's no hard rock on this cd. Not even what i would call Rock."
2,Tasted hollow.,It wasn't even sticky. It had no weight or taste to it at all. Like my rice with a bit of substance. Didn't find it in this rice. However it did cook really fast and easy.
5,Good buy,"I prefer the Kasmati rice to plain white rice. Easy to cook with and goes well with many sauces, meats, and vegetables."
3,It looks nice and it works but...,"I bought this tv cart based on its functionality and the Home Source name( I have a Home Source computer desk and a hutch which are the best I've ever owned and very solidly built too). It was easy to build but its not constructed solidly; it over-uses the wooden dowel connectors and lacks the locking screw connectors...in short it sort of wobbles...but since its not meant to move it works for me but this is not an endorsement. Its been said that the cd/dvd holders are too small, I dont know it wasn't a need for me. The adjustable shelf is among the worst I've owned; the holes meant to hold the metal supports are too wide and with the wobbling it fell twice while positioning the cart."
3,Cheaper at ACE Hardware,"I read some of the reviews saying this product can be bought cheaper elsewhere. I had already put my order in but Googled it before ordering. Sure enough, it can be bought at ACE Hardware online for $13.85. I bought it from ACE. Then I came back to Amazon to cancel the order I had on record and typed in 3M8000 Repirator and another the screen showed another seller offering it at the same price as ACE, $13.85. So, out of curiosity, I typed in just Respirators and it took me back to a screen showing the same item on sale for the $19+ I had seen originally."
5,amazon requested review,"The product was as advertised and received in a timely manner, and I wish Amazon would NOT pester me with the requests to provide reviews."
1,how do you expect a review when you don't send it,how stupid of you to ask for a review when you did not send it
3,Accounting Assistant,"Status unknown. Purchased because of H1N1 virus. Don't have any expectations for success. Purchases for peace of mind. What I have read, says the use of the N95 mask has no value and to have value it would requires a 20 minute fitting, which is able to be done. Failure is impossible because expectations are missing. Rating is also impossible without expectations."
3,"Good Mask, Band Problem","While they may not be a problem for one time use, the rubberized bands used on these masks don't hold up under repeated use. I use them for working outside in the colder months.(COPD) The elastic bands are more suited to repeated use. If you're buying for the job and people are tossing them at the end of the day, they're great. Hard to tell in the photos what kind of bands you're getting."
4,"Good Masks, Meets CDC recommended N95 or higher","Great masks. I bought 2 packs to keep in our family ""emergency kit."" They fit my small head pretty well. I'm a female with petite frame. They also fit my husband who is medium build. I am not so happy with the fluctuating costs, but lucky to get these at a decent price. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to be prepared for any unforeseen events. Personally, I'd rather be safe than sorry."
1,DON'T buy from them,I ordered 2 of these on April 28th 2009 at a price of $13.95 each. Four days later in the evening on May 1st I recieved an email saying they were out of stock and would have to cancell my order. Now I see that the item is back in stock on May 5th at $22.95 each. Talk about FEAR PROFITEERING. Canceling my order and repricing 65% higher. This company should be forbidened from doing business through amazon.com. If Amazon continues to use companies like this they will lose my business.
1,Another Plague Profiteer,"In the 10 minutes between when I put this in my cart and shopped for other items before checking out it went from $13.99 to $16.99. It's the only one of 5 different sizes not shown as out of stock, still it's 3 to 5 week shipping time. What gives? Again, I refuse to buy from people profiting from the swine flu. Based on the review from 2 hours ago the price bounces all over."
1,"Uncomfortable, unreliable fit, and foul odor","I bought these masks to wear during various dusty chores around the home, but after wearing them on several occasions over the course of a few weeks, I'm throwing the rest away. It is hard to get them to fit all the way around, especially around the nose, even with the adjustable metal nose band. So they are not only uncomfortable, they don't fit well enough to be a reliable filter. Furthermore, they smell really bad out-of-the-box. When I put on a new one, all I can smell is a foul chemical odor, and it doesn't go away. If I HAD to live with it because of dangerous work-place particles, I suppose I would, but there has got to be a more pleasant, better-fitting respirator mask out there. When I found myself making excuses not to wear this one, I realized it was time to look for alternatives."
1,3M 8000 RECALLED 010410,"Quoted from a Safety News ""Flash-Report""Cal-OSHA Reporter's Jan. 4 flash report about the recall of 3M 8000 respirators made reference to the ""8000 series."" That term has triggered a deluge of questions to Cal/OSHA about whether other 3M respirators are affected by the recall, which was ordered when health-care employers reported an unacceptably high failure rate during fit tests.For instance, Craig Brown, senior industrial hygienist for the VHA Center for Engineering & Occupational Safety and Health in Pittsburgh, Pa., notes that there are several sub-series of the 3M 8000 N95 respirators with different face molds, such as 8210, 8211, 8511, 8612, 8670 and more.The only respirators that have been recalled are the 8000s, says DOSH Senior Safety Engineer Deborah Gold. ""Other N95 respirators are not affected by the alert,"" she says.Maybe OK for dirt or dust particles but if your considering this mask for protection against virus or illnesses, think again..."
1,Not recommended,It is pretty well useless. I have compacted soil where I use it and it is difficult even to turn the machine around. The instructions are incomplete but the dolly is pretty easy to put together without. I keep wondering if I missed a step because of the performance.
5,Great Product,Ordered this product and it arrived in just a few days. Assembly was easy- just look at the photo and a two year old can put it together in minutes. I lined up the lift rods and tightened everything down and it works perfect on all my sleds. This one works better than the one I purchased a year ago for $250. I would recommend it.
1,"missing hardware, poor directions, shaky fram","After 4 week they said item was shipped, 5 weeks ups said they had not received item, the sportman guild said I would be refunded and shipment would be cancelled, they lied! 2 days shy of 6 weeks incomplete item was delivered. I am very sorry I bought this item!!"
2,Misrepresented battery capacity,No capacity of battery stated in specs but picture showed 7800 mHr capacity. Received 6600 mHr battery. I could have chosen other vendors at much lower price for a 6600 mHr battery. IHMO this is very sneaky.
4,Battery time again,I needed a replacement battery and ordered the battery along with adapter. Now my Sony Vaio is working like new again.
2,This battery just last 4 hours after charging complete,I bought this replacement battery for my viao TX 650. I tried 3 days. It just can last 4 hours after charging complete.

5,EXCELLENT,"You can't dispute facts, and those are exactly what Niall Ferguson provides in this thoroughly informative documentary. This production should be required viewing in every high school and college if we want our future generations to have a true and clear picture of the genesis of of world finance, its history, its present state and where it is headed if things are allowed to continue on their current course."
1,A pack of lies and misinformation,"All I'm going to say is that this documentary, rather than attempt to inform people about what money is and where it comes from, diverts away from the subject entirely, and turns it into an entertainment about Incas, jews and Shakespeare. This is a really horrific piece of propaganda from the ever declining BBC. I doubt very much that the documentary writers were ignorant to the basic, simple mechanism of the fractional reserve system (whereby banks, rather than lend you money that they already have, create it out of thin air!), so my conclusion is that they have purposefully ommitted such a discussion to divert people from the real problem. This film is a filthy load of propaganda for the status quo, and the presenter is an irritating mongrel, who was probably too stupid to grasp that the theory of the documentary was wrong. If I could give this 0 stars I would. Absolutely awful."
5,A Wonderful Introduction for those new to Philosophy!,"I have been looking for a good introduction to philosophy text for a long time for high school students. This one is it! It would also be good for a college Philosophy 100 class, or even adults who have no experience in philosophy. What makes this book so great is that it is not tremendously pedantic not oversimplifed. Rauhut includes every subject one would expect in an intro course from God, personal identity, free will, epistemology, ethics, and ontology. What separates this from others are the Food for Thought sections which take extremely difficult concepts and formulates them into concrete easy to understand examples; they also provide exercises that are perfect for a classroom setting and include discussion questions that actually promote discussion and get to the heart of the matter! I highly recommend this book"
5,TOKYO MEW MEW ROX!!!,"Oh boy, this is the best book yet! I LUV Kish, he's soooo HOTT. I'm so mad at Ichigo for liking Masaya instead of him. If I were her, I'd consider myself lucky. I cried when Kish died, it broke my heart that he would die to save the girl that doesn't even love him! ANYWAY.......I HIGHLY recomend that you read this book.By the way, im not a kid. Im just a girl who used the kids review so i wouldn't have to log on. im 14, seriously. Luv ya!-Rezurii"
4,Routing Audio through DVD Recorder,"I just purchased this DVD-Recorder and think it is a good product. However there is one oddity I found, which I don't know is common with DVD-Recorders. When routing the cable box through a VCR and then into my stereo, I am not required to have the VCR ON to play my cable box(in this case, my cable input)through my stereo. This was my original setup.However, I can't seem to hear my audio from the cable box(Motorola with DVR)through the Stereo (Yamaha) UNLESS the DVD Recorder is ON. I have no problems with video or audio from the DVD recorder into the stereo, nor any problems with cable box playing through my normal TV audio. But I cannot get the Cable audio through the stereo unless the DVD-R is on.Any help/guidance would be appreciated."
1,redorder,"I have the sony rdr gx300. It was a very good recorder until recently. Disks that I recorded on this unit suddenly stopped playing. One disk that I recorded on just two months ago I tried to watch; the picture was there but no sound, Then later the unit said 'disk is unreadable' 'cannot play this disk'. This just happened, until now it played them fine."
1,An Expensive Paper Weight,"Don't buy SONY! After owning this product for little over a year, it fails to read any disk. All disks, commercial, -r, -rw,+rw, even disks it has created on it's own, generate the ""disk error"" message. Brand new disks (straight from the packaging) even generate this message now. Sony was uninterested in assisting me, simply telling me to send the unit in, at my cost and they would let me know what it will cost for repairs. Best case scenario was over $120.00 plus shipping. Costs could be $300.00 or more. Or course then they could keep the paperweight and I could tell them not to repair it. Don't take my word for it, before you buy Sony, google ""Sony disk error"" and see how many hits you get. The most knowledgeable claim the problem is a faulty laser assembly, which Sony is aware of but refuses to make right. I realize things do not last forever, but modern electronic equipment should function longer than 18months. I don't see myself ever purchasing another Sony product."
3,Not worth the Money,"I ordered this DVD Player and I am not able to use the main feature, which is chasing playback. For some reason the DVD player will not let me use this function, and after several hours on the phone with Sony's customer service the problem is still not fixed. I wish Sony had better customer service. Would not purchase this item online, make sure you check out all the features right after you purchse this item. And purchase this item in a store so that you can return it if it doesn't work."
1,Piece of Crap,What can I say? It's a piece of bullcrap. It does not do what it says it will and I have tried this product for months with the cream(like it says to do). Any slight fading is all in your head or dependant on the light in the room. I have since gone to a thoractic specialist and let me tell you no cream or capsules is going to get rid of your spider veins. There's often a deeper issue involved and you're just wasting your money. I've done it-twice.
5,Excellent Phone,"Bought this phone in January and boy am I impressed! The battery life is excellent as well as the speakerphone. This would be my 4th Sprint Phone since 1999 and overall the best of the bunch. My only gripes are that this phone lacks a camera, and the color screen is hard to view in bright sunlight. But this seems to be a problem with all these color gadgets these days. This is yet one reason why my GPS will remain in monochrome. Maybe one day companies will get color mastered, and devices will be viewable in the bright sun. But so far nothing beats monochrome for this."
3,"Nice design, battery life...horrible speakerphone feature","I've been a big Sanyo fan for some time (of the options provided by Sprint). Great battery life and consistently strong reception on digital and analog roaming situations. I was excited to get this one as a replacement to my dead 4900.I love the size, keypad, battery, etc. What is the deal with the speakerphone? I can't hear anything on it...all garbled. With all the speakerphones I've seen lately, none of them match a Nokia that I had YEARS ago!What's the deal?"
3,Close but I don't get the connection,"According to Sprint this is the upgraded ""sister"" version of the Sanyo RL2000 PCS Vision Ready Link Phone, which I also own and will never trade up or in. Unlike the RL2000, the 4920 truly lacks the reception and battery life of the RL2000. I've always been a fan of the ""candy bar"" style phones for their better reception than the ""flip phones"", but the 4920 fails in reception in my area. Some of the newer features are nice; ringtones, screensavers, and smaller size, but nothing is worth the comprimise of dropped calls. Do Not use this phone if it going to be used as a business line; you may be out of business soon. Based on research, candy bar phones have better reception than flip phones, but don't bet your money on this one. FIND A Sanyo RL2000 PCS Vision Ready Link Phone. It may be a bit bulky, but the battery life is enormous and the reception is unsurpassed by other phones I've tested."
1,Ugh,"First of all the good things about this phone are its durability and it size. This phone is definitely tough, and its compact size is great (especially for a bar phone). The bad thing about it is that the jack for an ear piece stops working after about one month of regular use. I have gone through three of these phones, and am finally just getting rid of it. The third one stopped working two days after I received it. Two of the phones I've been through also had a few buttons stop working (the back button and the right arrow button). I'm not the only one with this problem, either. Evidently this happens frequently according to a rep I talked to at a Sprint Store. I am not happy with this phone at all."
1,Sensitive But Not To Bright,"The 4900 was a far superior phone. The 4920 display cannot be viewed in sunlight (you cannot even tell the phone is active). The push buttons frequently require a second try/entry. The optimum sensitivity for the pushbuttons is when the phone is in a pocket . . . the buttons always seem to work. The Hold Functions (back key) requires pressing and holding twice. To undo the hold function one needs to push and hold twice or place the phone in your pocket to activate.I purchased the phone for its ""outstanding"" reception,"" but have found the reception fair at best (frequently no reception at all where the 4900 had strong reception).On the plus side, the battery life of the 4920 is outstanding.So . . . if you are looking for a phone with fair reception, you cannot read in sunlight, where key works best when the phone is in your pocket, with outstanding battery life, this is the phone for you . . . want mine!"
1,Attacking Christians and not the Y2K issues.,"Hank has written a short review of the ""Y2K"" problem without any real computer expertise. This book spends more time attacking some Great Christian leaders like, Dobson, Kennedy, Burkette and not enough time doing any real research on the actual computer Y2K problem. This book seems to be a quickly written thesis (not a book) to sensationalize on the Y2K problem, before it was too late to make any money on it."
4,Pleasant yuletide dixie sound,"What I've found somewhat unusual is that this group is made up of a clarinet, trombone, guitar, and bass. No trumpet!! But it's a nice easy listening cd. Don't look for any wild improvisations so there's no mistaking the melody. It has a dixie sound but not much more than that.It's one of those cd's that probably most people would find enjoyable. It's a good buy!!"
3,The event that could have been...,"Plenty of highs and lows. See Keith Hackney (215 lbs 5'11"") up against BIG Emanuel Yarbourough (600+ lbs 6'8""). Great match Kimo v. Gracie but the winner can't continue...Shamrock in a good bout with Felix Lee Mitchel but the winner can't continue. The highly anticipated Gracie v. Shamrock rematch is put on hold as an alternate gets into the final. The matches are good but too many disappointments."
3,Great pacing....mostly accurate,"Ruth Heller writes a compelling and entertaining story. The illustrations are great and the pacing of the book is engaging. However, as a scientist and informal science educator, I was disappointed by a few inaccuracies in the text that could be easily corrected if a new edition of this book were published. First, an anther is part of the stamen and rests on the filament (in the book she writes "" From an anther on a stamen""). Second, fungi are no longer considered a type of plant. Minus these two things this book is a great teaching tool which I've used with many students to discuss floral anatomy and plant life cycles. I've sidestepped the inaccuracies by using it as an opportunity to discuss with students the importance of using multiple literature sources when studying a topic."
5,Great Book!,"This book covers everything you can imagine related to plants, flowers, and seeds! I use this book all the time with my gardening students. LOVE THIS BOOK!"
2,Flashlight,"This was a gift purchased for someone else, so we know nothing about reliability, etc. Thus, the four stars instead of five. However, it looks like a good flashlight with a broad beam, which is what the recipient desired. Shipping was very prompt and easy.UPDATE: After seeing the flashlight, I am lowering my rating to two stars. I had to work on the flashlight to get the direct beam to work. The batteries were not making contact with the light, and the light didn't work. The fluorescent area light worked, but not the direct beam. After fiddling/bending the contact point, I was able to make it work. Really, Coleman, this should not happen."
1,Thing never worked - not even once,"Put the batteries in, thing never turned on. I looked up on the internet and apparently it is the switch mechanism that malfunctions, or never functions... I even tested the batteries. Unfortunately I lost the receipt as well. Oh joy."
1,Not durable; un-reliable,"I wanted a flashlight-lantern combination for power outages and camping. I found only two models of this type in my area and went with the Coleman. I've used it three times and on the last time in my time of need: (Hurricane Ike and the ensuing power failure), this thing failed me. Thought it was the battery but it was not. It is the switch. The switch won't activate the light. Luckily, I had another one but a different model that I've used for many years that keeps coming through for me. The fit and finish of the coleman seems flimsy....almost frail. This product shouldn't use the coleman name. Get something else that is more durable and reliable."
4,Changed My Review,"I was originally disappointed in this flashlight but have relied on it numerous times for lighting during power outtages. If you are looking for just a flashlight, I recommend the Big Kahuna 95 LED for under $30."
2,"Great when it works, fix found","So, this is a great flashlight when it works correctly. Unfortunately, it didn't work correctly for very long. Mine stopped working and I thought that the batteries had gone out, so I changed them and it still didn't work. A couple months later I decided to fix it. After tinkering with my volt meter for a while I thought that the switch may be bad, but then I discovered that the only problem was that the batteries weren't in tight enough to have all of the contacts touching.I fixed it by removing the batteries and bending the contacts in the bottom of the battery compartment up with a screwdriver. I didn't have to bend them very far and it fixed the problem. The batteries are now snug and it works. I assume that I will have to repeat this process once they become loose again. Seems like kind of a poor and/or cheap design."
2,Beautiful until it breaks. which is soon.,"This was a really great flashlight in both modes, once I figured out how to install the batteries. But it did not survive tumbling from the cupboard under the sink to the linoleum kitchen floor. Now nothing works, and I've only had it for eight months.It seems like the switch might be flaky."
2,"Interesting concept, but could have done better","I read this book with much interest, mainly because it has the same name of a wireless internet company that I've heard of in Hong Kong. This company, Mindbond claims to convert internet sites to the mobile phone, and uses this page to demonstrate it's capabilities. I think the story is well stated, and the figures are full of depth, but i could only hope that the interaction between them would be more tenseful and exciting."
3,Drag Queens go to sea.,"I would not call this a history of gay life at sea. I would call it a history of Drag Queens at sea. While a very interesting book in some respects - the gay slang, while making sense, was new to me. Very interesting book in the very, very narrow niche that it does cover, it is in no way it representative of what I would consider the whole gay community at sea."
4,iT'S A CUTE BOOK,"MY LITTLE GIRL LOVED THIS BOOK! THE TONE AND THE TEMPO OF THE STORY ABOUT THIS LITTLE GIRL, WAS A JOY TO READ. IT REMINDS ME OF MY GREAT UNCLE AT OUR FAMILY OUTINGS. THE STORY IS TOLD WITH FUN, LOVE AND PRIDE."
3,A couple of things about Nappy Hair,"A couple of things about this book: The author implied that all people of color have nappy hair. This is untrue. Many people can have nappy hair, regardless of race or sex. I also found it interesting that all of the characters in the book basically had the same features. The only difference between any of the town folk, the family, the angels was different types of hair. I think the focus on the hair may be a bad thing. She was different, because she did not have the same kind of hair as everyone else did. I think this is a negative impact, because it is basically saying that if you are not the same as the crowd, then you are not a part of it. I think that this book could have a negative affect on a child. If a child that was reading this book was as different as the little girl, s/he would be uneasy about going out and being exposed to the community. It would take some time to be proud of what s/he may have to offer."
1,It is the most degrading book by a black woman author,"My daughter brought this book home to read. I was appauled.This book written by a black woman is degrading Afro-American people as well as black women. I feel Afro-American people haven't reach the diversity to talk about our hair. The language(Black English) is not how Black people talk today. I feel Herron need to be sued by the Black community .She has allot of guts writing some insulting literature for other cultural to relate to in the class room. She is slapping her race in the face, as well as calling us ""Buck Wheat"" off the Little Rascals.I feel as a Afro-American Historian and educator. I couldn't get away with teaching or reading this literature to a class of white children or any other ethnic child. I would be fired not resigned to another school."
2,Disappointed,The illustrations in this book are gorgeous however the actual storyline is disappointing. I thought this book was about the empowerment of nappy hair however I found it insulting. The beginning and middle of the book was one put down after another then the author tries unsuccessfully to put a positive spin at the end. I would not recommend this book for anyone.
5,Correction needed,Correction to the review from Book News Inc. The Authors are professors at the UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS and professional filmmakers. Everything else in the review is correct.
4,A must-have to add to your collection!,"Many new and unusual ways on preparing fruit, from the common to the exotic. Dishes range from savory to sweet, main dish to desert. The format is easy to read and work from."
5,Great Book!,"I needed to understand everything I could about Futures and Options in a short time and this book was perfect for that purpose. The introduction about futures and options is great and the content in general is very easy to understand and follow. I really liked the examples and the way the author explained each topic. However, I have to confess that maybe my engineering background helped me to understand the math behind, but I believe that even if you don't have much mathematical knowledge you can follow the book.A big plus of this book is that it contains a chapter about Value at Risk and one focused more on more recent types of derivatives contracts (e.g., energy, weather, etc.).In general, I think that with this book you could cover more ground more quickly than with other books."
3,You better know your math,"The book is a good book IF you know your math. It has been a while since I have done calculus and finance classes and needed to review other books in order to understand all the math. I laughed at the introduction when the author stated math is not needed. While this is partially true, it is because the author expects the reader to memorize his formulas and so omitts some of the steps of how the formulas come about. Do not try to do this book without help or even better yet, without the solution manual. It was a grueling class with more than 1/2 the class dropping it because the book was so hard to understand."
5,A must have for anime collectors,This is one of the series that started Japanese anime in the USA. The graphics isn't the best but I still love it :)
4,Pilot Brake Controller,I ilot Rrake Controller in very good condition and time. Very satisfied with performance and installationwas very easy.
3,Pro Digital ... Nude & Glamour Photography,"This book offers numerous good pointers and advice on choosing location for setting, lighting, and composition. I had a tough time getting past the author's ideas of what constitutes subtle and glamourous. He may have strained something patting himself on the back for his accomplishments. Then again, this IS a very subjective matter and I may be a wee bit opinionated. The author's idea of sensual and galmourous is a bit more on the ""Penthouse"" side than I find 'sensuous.' Nonetheless, it offers some good insights and is a worthy read. I also purchased Garage Glamour by Rolando Gomez and found that even more helpful."
2,"Good, but thought it would be more technical","Photos were good and some poses were interesting,but thought it would be more technical in what the shoots were Light positions Exposure settings,etc"
3,didnt cut it,"After reading all reviews here, i bit the bullet and bought book.After 20 mins of getting through i am largely dissapointed. Book consist of basically ""well, i was there and i asked {ModelName} to do this, and she selected this pose, which makes this nice image"" paragraphs. About few of those photos actually are glamour and artsy and good. Hence it worth about 3 stars..Rest is making me question how well author can photograph.I am off to cancel pre-order of his another book. Eeek.."
3,"This is rather a photo book, not book about taking photos.","A said before, book consist of basically ""well, i was there and i asked {ModelName} to do this, and she selected this pose, which makes this nice image"" paragraphs...So this book is collection of images with few not to detailed sentences about every shot.I certainly expected more from this book."
1,Disappointing,This book is disappointing compared to many of the glamour books for digital photographers that are now available. Author Bill Lemon offers little that is new and rehashes much of the same info that is already out there. Save your money on this purchase and look around a little more before you buy. You can do much better for your money.
2,"Poor Quality photos, no real information","I brought this book a while back and was not happy with it, lucky for amazon I'm a lazy person when it comes to returning things, especially onine. The photos are poor, they look like someone used a compact camera to take the shot, and with no artistic or creative skill either.There are maybe a few pictures which may be considered close to pro level but as a non pro myself I can already acheive better quality pictures. i expected more than this, there was no depth to the pictures on how they were designed or envisioned by the photographer, just a bunch of random pictures."
4,Clears Away the Cobwebs!,"This fine, detailed & user-friendly book opens up a director's view of the world of cinematic movement & how it relates to good story-telling through film. Staging scenes, blocking, camera movement, choreography of scene movent, reverse shots, camera angles, tracking, exterior & interior shooting, staging multiple characters in a scene...it's all here, with drawings that clearly illustrate the informative text."
4,Good for small salad...,"This is a nice little colander (smaller than I expected). It works well for small salads or fruit. It also works for draining boiled eggs. It only has a small edge on bottom, so won't lift very far off of a sink bottom, so perhaps not the most sanitary in a sink. Because of that, I am not sure I would want to use it for pasta, but at least it is up off the sink surface a teensy bit."
5,"Biblical, Innovative and Practical","Rick Richardson does a good job here of getting 21st century Christians to THINK about evangelism in new and innovative ways. He encourages readers to get a better understanding of today's society, emphasizing that we as a church can't provide Biblical answers if we don't take time to listen to the questions. The author stays true to his title and draws outside the lines to explore new means of bringing people to Christ.Some people may misunderstand this book, thinking that Richardson is forsaking the time-honored gospel by substituting church growth gimmicks and man-made strategies. Actually Richardson is very conservative in his theology, but very progressive in his methodology. Unless the reader distinguishes between the two, he/she will have a difficult time benefiting from this work.I recommend this book to all believers, especially church leaders, who are looking for new ways to cultivate relationships with the lost and to bring them to salvation in Christ."
4,Spidey fans will not be disappointed,"This book is a real treat for Spidey fans like myself and it was great. The dialogue gets weak in spots but it is just like the comic book so no real complaints there. Spiderman flings the one liners and sometimes they're funny and sometimes... Otherwise the story is full of great action and even a glimpse into the life of MJ. The author has done a really good job at putting spiderman into a novel and not making it unimaginative. This is great buy for all action adventure fans and a even better read for those who love the Amazing Spiderman. Sometimes, if you concentrate you can actually see that great marvel art work as you read."
3,Super Reader,"Just another fun superhero romp. Venom being evil crazy venom and all that. I am not a huge Spider-Man fan, but I am happy to read Diane Duane Spider-Man books, no problem. Venom as big slobbering fanged crazyman, with a bit of a thing for wanting to indulge in arachnid appetisers is what you find here. Hell hath no fury like a black alien bodysuit symbiote scorned."
3,another rubber band,"I'm happy with the facial mechanical works, but I'm disappointed with the quality of the rubber band. This is the second rubber band I've owned."
4,Overall great watch,"I was searching for an everyday watch that was rugged, manly looking and of hight quality, yet affordable. I wanted something a bit more grown up than a Fossil or the like.This watch did not disappoint me. It is heavy, but not overly so. It feels extremely durable. The pictures on the web site do not do it justice. It is an extremly handsome, manly watch. It does a great job balancing it's ruggedness with beauty.It keeps time well enough. It is a Bulova, afterall.My only small gripe is with the rubber watch band. It is very sturdy, but also extremely thick and tough. I don't have small wrists, yet there is a lot of band ""left over"" after I buckle it that kind of free floats and tends to snag. I have noticed that after a little bit of time, the band does become a bit more maleable and managable. It's still a little bulky.Overall, I think it's a great watch at a great price."
1,wrong catalog #,This item DOES NOT fit the 2002 Ford Explorer XLT. it is too short. The correct item for this vehicle is #65032 Reese.
4,very pleased,"very very good. it's as new (clean, clear, crisp and non-smelly pages)except that the spirals are a little bent but new ones can be like that as well. love it! thank you."
2,Not great,"These tracks are taken from live concert recordings, and the sound and performances are not as good as the original WB recordings. If you want a concert recording, fine. But if you're thinking this is a compilation of studio tracks, beware."
2,good only for live concert lovers,"It is recorded in live concert. But it is disappointing that I cant't see It in any part of the box of this CD, I don't like live concert music with voices and other..I am not happy of this purchase"
2,good movie ..Bad DVD quality,Saw this movie on theater long time ago.It was a very nice thrill with beautiful filming.the DVD quality of this one is blur and sounds not clear.Wish someday someone will release a better version of this nice movie.
4,Best Jermaine Collection,"Forget Arista's too short Heritage Collection, this is the one Jermaine Jackson collection to own. All of his Pop Top 40 hits are here (kudos to Hip-O for remembering the Top 20 ""Let Me Tickle Your Fancy""-backing vocals by Devo!), and it ends with 1992's ""I Dream, I Dream."" The liner notes are 2001 up-to-date, the sound is excellent and the worse I can say is that it's missing his much-played (but never charted) 1984 duet with Michael-""Tell Me I'm Not Dreaming."""
2,WHERE IS MY TOUCH OF MADNESS????,"...THIS SONG SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON ALL OF JERMAINE'S GREATEST HITS RELEASES. I have to tell all of you out there (and there may be some who already know the record. Many of those who are Jermaine Jackson fans know what I'm talking about) this is a BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL song. It is a shame that the song has never received the airplay or the credit it deserves. It is simply gorgeous and I feel has EVERY, and I do mean EVERY right to be considered as one of Jermaine's all time greatest hits...Thanks for listening."
4,wonderful voice,"Jermaine has one of the most soothing voices (next to Michael) I've ever heard in my life. He really knows how to either relax you or help you to get up and dance around the room. This cd was worth every dime. If your thinking about buying a cd by Jermaine, this the one you may want to purchase."
5,Jermaine Jackson Ultimate Collection,"Jermaine is a very underated singer some of the songs included show you that he is a talent on his own .don't forget he sang lead on some Jackson 5 songs like I Found That Girl etc.Michael is my favorite singer of all time but Jermaine never got due respect.Let's Be Young Tonight,Let's Get Serious,Let Me Tickle Your Fancy Dynamite Daddy's Home and Don't Take It Personal are all classic songs i remember on fm pop radio growing up in the .also there are some lesser known songs like Castles Of Sand You Like Me Don't You that are catchy and should of been big hits also.i used to have a greatest hits and classics cd by Jermaine with some of these songs included but this collection has more songs and better sound quality.any fan of Michael Jackson or Jackson 5 like me should give this cd a listen you won't be sorry.a great way to sample some of Jermaine's best songs."
4,"""let's get serious & dynamite...Jermaine Jackson!""","Hip-O presents the lone Jackson of the '70s at Motown...listen to the ""Ultimate Collection""...18 tracks from ""My Name Is Jermaine"" era. Stand out, is the Stevie Wonder tune ~ ""LET'S GET SERIOUS""...which hit the top of R&B charts...big time, a dance beat that would make the ""disco-clubs"" proud...another highlight is ~ ""DYNAMITE"", the dance-exuberant-carefree number with Jackson written all over it...if you're a fan, this is a must have!You might try other albums from Hip-O, all worthy of a good listen ~ ""J.T.

1,A Waste of Time and Money,"I ordered this book because I had received so much good information from Trendfund.com, the website that Tiny is affiliated with. What I got was a book that does an incomplete job of describing a limited number of general technical analysis tools. There are so many other book that are more complete, like Kamich ,""How Technical Analysis Works"", which I also own and would recommend hands-down over this book."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"There are so many other books on technical analysis that are more comprehensive than this one (e.g. Kamish, How Technical Analysis Works). I bought it because I had received so much good information at Trendfund.com, the website affiliated with Tiny. I had hoped that this book would continue with great real life examples of successful trades. The book does a poor job of discussing general technical analysis tools. I was disappointed. I'm willing to sell my copy for $10. I can't imagine anyone giving this book 5 stars unless they have a financial interest in the book's success. Of course, you can get all this information for free by logging on to Stockcharts.com."
5,Great book for Beginners,"It's a great book if your just starting to get into trading, a bit pricy but worth the info. On the bad side is that alot of trading info is on the web now. If you look really hard you could probably find all of the stuff scattered over the web. But a beginner wouldn't know where to start. Like how he goes over TA indicators like ADX and RSI, but if you didn't know what they were in the first place then you wouldn't know where to look. Concise and full of info."
2,Difficult to digest or put into action,"This will be brief.Although I like Laura Day's other works,I found ""Practical Intuition in Love"" to be very vague, even though I have read it several times. Perhaps it just didn't communicate with me specifically.A book I prefer, which is similar, is the out-of-print but WONDERFUL ""Finding Each Other"" by Mary Olsen-Kelly and Don Kelly. You can get it on the internet very inexpensively. Go look for it!"
3,Disappointed,"I really like Laura Day's other books. This is the weakest book she has ever written. The idea that ""pleasure"" must be the major component for romantic relationships is pretty unrealistic. It is a major theme of this book. She states each person should find the interaction ""pleasurable"" to connect. I do not find this to be the case in real life. People connect for many reasons and not just ""pleasure."" Also her exercise on contacting people to quiz them about what they think of you is just weird. I found Sherrie Dillard's Love and Intuition and Servet Hasan's Tune Him In, Turn Him On much better books. One thing about Day compared to other authors is she is not into auras or any new age terminology, which is great in some ways and limiting in other ones."
2,Disappointed,"I liked her first book ""practical intuition"", but this one was a reach. I have had a hard time finishing it, not sure I will make it. Some of the exercises were vague so frustrating..."
4,mostly lots of fun,"i heard that demi moore and courtney cox are both super lauraday fans so i figured, hey, why not read this book and find out why...well. to be honest, it's kinda schoolish. she gives you all these little exercises to do. it felt a bit homeworky. i was a rebel and sorta just flipped around the chapters to the parts that looked like the most fun- like the magazine-ish discovery quiz things- you know, ""you're walking in the woods, you come to a house, there's a key...""all in all, the exercises are mostly lots of fun and helpful... and isn't FUN helpful stuff the best type of helpful stuff? i would definitely encourage anyone to get the paperback version. it's great vacationy or just-before-bedtime reading."
5,"Wonderful...simply wonderful""(JC,Forced Entries)",This book is a great book for avid JC readers and newer ones. Void of Course reinforces what a true poet Carroll really is.
3,Coulda Been Better,"Carrol shines on two poems: the fragmented ""...Kurt Cobain"" and the epic and magical ""While She's Gone."" Allright, COULDA BEEN BETTER!!!!"
1,Well worth waiting for.,The new collection from Jim Carroll was well worth waiting for. Carroll's perspective of the stark city life is well represented in this work. A must read for fans of contemporary poetry.
1,There are a few good lines in this book,"Jim can be clever and funny and there are a few memorable lines in this book. The last poem is cool. Jim always had an intangible quality that I liked but he really lost me with this book. There is not much art to it, lots of times it seems like he isn't even trying. The writing is lazy. He is also too crass at times. I thought it was stupid."
1,Very Poor Presentation of the Topic,"While this DVD course has much interesting material, the presentation given by the instructor is unsatisfactory. The instructor simply reads from his notes. There are very very few graphics supporting this (even simple power point slides are missing for the most part). The camera wobbles back and forth as it tries to follow the instructor rocking back and forth. This would be an excellent resource if the production company would simply use the narration given by the instructor and replace the video portion with supported graphics to support the topic and details. As it is right now, the DVDs are very difficult and boring to watch."
3,"Okay, but...","You'd think that with such an expensive watch, the manufacturer would spring for some numbers on the dial."
1,Save your money!,I got this for my 3yo son for Christmas last year. It was returned to Walmart the day after Christmas. Not the quality Little Tikes product we are used to. It was broken within 5 minutes. Do not buy this product.
1,Dissappointed,"I purchased the Little Tikes drumset for my 2 yr old son. He loved it because he likes to bang however it lasted for just about 5 minutes of druming.First of all the item is very frail. The cymbal broke off in the first 2 mins of play. The snare and tom tom drums flies off after every hit leaving me to always have to connect it again. The electronic panel worked only for the first night and stopped, and the headset doesn't work.This toy is not suited for 2 yr old. I don't know what purpose it serves because a one year old would probably only bounce it over because of how frail it is. I had to use crazy glue tohold some of the parts together so they would stop flying"
1,Horrible!,"My daughter loves the drums so we thought that this would be perfect for her 2nd bday. It broke the day after we got it and would never stay together. We took it back and thankfully got our money back. Found out it was not even made by Little Tikes, but another company and Little Tikes slapped their name on it. they may want to rethink that."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,My son recieved this as a present for his 3rd birthday. He was so excited because he loves music so much. The first day the cymbol broke and the small attachable drums kept falling off. Don't waste your money on this!!!
1,Constantly fall apart,The drums constantly fall out of the set. Even Crazy Glue can not keep this drum set together. If you want to put it together every time your child hits the drum 4 or 5 times buy this product otherwise I recommend staying away!!!
1,Don't buy this toy,I bought this toy for my 2 year old son and was very disappointed. At least five minutes after I put it together the piece that holds the cymbal broke off when my son hit the cymbal with the drum-stick. The pieces that hold the other 2 smaller drums onto the large drum do not stay in place and fall off when hit. I plan on returning the toy.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! BREAKS BEFORE ASSEMBLYING!,"I was VERY DISSAPOINTED. Typically Little Tikes is known for well-made toys; however, this is the exception. It started breaking and falling apart while trying to take it out the box and put it together. DO NO BUY!"
1,Zero Stars,"Unlike the other people who bought this drumset, I didn't have the pleasure of being able to use it for seven minutes before it broke, it came out of the box broken. The microphone/lights didn't work at all, and within a matter of hours, parts started to snap off and would constantly need to be put back together a few minutes after playing. I finally got so fed up with it breaking and parts snapping off, I returned it. This year I already bought a generic brand that I put together in advance, and it is 110% better than this. Not recommended. Shame on Little Tykes."
1,Do Not Buy!!!,"I heartily agree with all the other reviews-do NOT buy this drum set. The two side drums constantly fall off, and within 20 minutes of playing, the drum set tipped over on it's unsteady feet, and the cymbal snapped off. I took mine back to the Toysr'us where I got it, and they took it back happily. If you want a good drum set for a 3 year old, they have a great one at Target in the Kool Toyz section-much better made than this one, and cheaper too!"
1,The CHEAPEST toy ever!!,"This toy is a joke. It is the flimsiest and most unstable toy and I can not believe that Little Tikes allows their name on it. The side drums do not stay on, the plastic pieces broke in 1 day, and the foot drum thing when pressed make the whole set fall over. The most frustrating thing about it is that after you have to take it away from your child any try to explain why they can't keep it, is that the concept of this toy is great. If a quality drum set like this could be made with the music and lights etc. it would be great. I haven't found any other drum set that's really appropriate for a 2yr old.My son also received a Little Tikes CD Player with two microphones for his birthday and they literally worked for 1 minute. After that only the CD worked and not the microphones. Both of these toys have the Little Tikes name but are actually manufactured by another company. I will no longer buy Little Tikes item that requires batteries because they are sooooo poorly made."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I wish I had seen the other reviews before I recommended my sister purchase this for my son's third birthday! Within minutes of putting this toy together, my son and nephew (both 3) had destroyed this set. The cymbol and both side drums snapped off. Don't waste your money on this drum - you are better off using pots & pans!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Within 7 minutes of taken this toy out of the box it was broken. When my son hit the cymbal with the drum stick it fell off. The little drums to attach fall off. The plastic pieces to hold these to the main drum are so flimsy that they crack off.This toy is said to be for a three year old, but when I put the headpiece on my 18 month old it was too small. The stool is too small for him also.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS WAS THE WORST TOY I HAVE BOUGHT FOR HIM YET!!!!!!"
5,Should be required reading!!!,"Robert Bly's book should be required reading for everyone associated with sales and marketing! This includes everyone that produces, hires, and/or works with copywriters. I have worked in sales and production in the construction, engineering and architectural industries since the mid 1970's. Mr. Bly has filled in the gaps and given me another view of copywriting that personal experience has not taught me. His ""Copywriter's Handbook"" will be on my reference shelf for a long time! I appreciate his writing style and information so much that I am currently reading his ""Online Copywriter's Handbook"". I can't wait to give my review on that book also! I appreciate you Mr. Bly!"
5,Exceptional Guide for Writers,"Simply put, this book is an exceptional nuts-and-bolts guide to copywriting. I highly recommend it."
2,Pass on this one!,"I bought this book because it was supposedly the new and updated version on Bob Bly's classic. Well, let me tell you, there was nothing updated about it. It uses computer and word processing terminology from the early 1980's. In the section which talks about what the freelance writer needs to get his/her business off the ground, it tells the reader that you can get a good computer for around $2,500! Personal computers havent cost that much since the late 1980's!! These are just a couple of examples, but the book is filled with 1980's references. You can tell that a proof-reader simply read through the original copy and missed such references. Then, the publisher gave it a new cover, and sent it back to press! Overall, I found this book to be a pile of badly outdated references and advice which is useless in 2005! I re-sold my copy on Amazon yesterday!"
5,One Of The Best Books On Copywriting,"A great back to basics book on the craft of advertising. I recommend this book to all junior copywriters out there and to those who are interested in writing advertising copy. Although a little out dated but the facts and insights remain extremely useful and enlightening. In fact, this was the very first book on copywriting that I got and it is still one of my all time favorites till this day."
5,The name says it all: this is the copywriter's handbook,"After looking for a decent book on copywriting on Amazon (where else?), I decided to buy this one, based on the positive reviews it got from other readers. And, I must say, they were right. This is an excellent book if you want to learn the basics of copywriting and start off as a freelancer!"
4,Muy bueno pero se centra en cómo trabajar para una agencia,"La primera parte es excelente, con buenas ideas y ejemplos. La segunda parte, de cómo trabajar como copywriter, está enfocada en cómo trabajar para una empresa de publicidad más que en cómo trabajar freelance directamente con los anunciantes. Me hubiese gustado que explicara más esto último. De cualquier manera, es muy recomendable."
3,Buena ayuda!,"Compre este libro para mejorar mi habilidad para escribir COPY para promos y comerciales. Lamentablemente no tiene mucha cobertura sobre spots de TV y Radio, sin embargo es de muy buena ayuda para escribir Copy de material impreso.Debes leerlo si estas buscando tener un conocimiento más sólido sobre como escribir Copy que sea efectivo."
4,An entriguing twist on a ghostly story,"This short book is just being released and I received it as a gift. I couldn't put it down. From the first moment the bloody ghost is described to the awakening of the young girl in the Sea Wing kept me intrigued. A wonderful description of a family in crises and the strange events of the past that surround this deteriorating castle. I felt compelled to read on, finishing it in one night."
2,Weak Mix,-I have been taking ZMA off and on for a couple years now and TwinLabs usually make a good product BUT thier ZMA fuel is not one of them. I don't know if it is a bad mix or a bad batch I got but it didn't produce the same effects as the other ZMA mixes I have used from a couple other companies. Therefore I do not recommend using this particular mix.
3,Asprin Please!!!,"I rate this toy right up there with those popcorn popper toys. Cute at first and then you want to pull your hair out. Yes it does have a volume control, but the tones that come out the toy are just unbearable. The prerecorded tunes all sound the same, just a slightly different tempo. Overall I am not impressed, and when the novelty of the present is gone...so will be the guitar---anyone want it??"
2,Fun buttons for kids but annoying for parents,"This has survived my 5 y.o. boy and now my 2 y.o. boy old enjoys it because buttons are fun - even nonsensical buttons. I don't enjoy it and am shopping for something better - more educational, musically related, and pleasant to the ear. The main buttons are drum keys, not notes. The volume control has little variation and the standard songs and beats get annoying quickly due to the overly synthetic sounds. But the kids still pick it up and play with it now and then. Arggh!"
2,What a disappointment!,"I was so looking forward to a good read, but no-o-o-o! After 80 pages I was so disgusted that I threw the book to the floor. Yuck! This author is so careless in her story telling which is sad because the fundamental plot is such a good one. However, dialogue is stiff and falls erringly on the ear. You know no one speaks like that. The characters are shallow and only knowable on the most technical and superficial level. What makes a good or great detective story is a good plot plus exquisite attention to the details. Whoever edited Sun Storm for Ms. Larsson has done her a great disservice. Asa has some raw talent which needs a lot of honing. My hope for Ms. Larsson is that she works hard to develop some real writing skills."
1,Terrible Book,"Do not buy this book! I can't believe it would have been any better even before translation. I cant understand how it received any awards. This book seemed like it was written by a high schooler. The errors in translation are distracting and obvious. There is no plot, silly characterization,and stilted, non-sensical dialogue. This is the worst book I've read in a long time."
4,Nice start to an interesting series,"This is the first of what the author states will be six stories featuring tax lawyer turned crime solver Rebecka Martinsson and policewoman Anna-Maria Mella. Set in the snowy terrain of northern Sweden, the story gives the reader an introduction to Rebecka's past (which most likely helps to dictate her present) as it pulls you into a murder involving Rebecka's former friends. There is a bit of horror in the story and a disquieting solution to what appears to be parental neglect. Nonetheless, it is a good read that made me seek out book 2 and 3 in the series."
2,disappointing,"I went into this book with high hopes but I didn't get more than halfway through when I finally decided to skip to the last page and even that was disappointing. I love Scandanavian authors, but this wasn't very well written. There are better books out there, like the Kurt Wallander series by Henning Mankell and any of Karin Fossum's books."
2,unimpressive,"I was quite disappointed with Sun Storm. It is similar in style to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but much less satisfying. It reads like an imitation by a novice writer."
3,Not up to Dragon Tattoo,Read for mystery book club as recommended by Oprah. We were divided--some liked the plot and characters but others felt plot was jerky with too many loose ends.
3,Animal Cruelty,"I liked the story and the main characters. I liked the setting and learning more about Sweden. I did not like the useless cruelty to a poor small dog. It brought tears to my eyes and I can't get the image out of my mind. Also it seemed that the main character underwent so much brutality herself, and that was hard to read at times. I did't enjoy the abuse of power propagated by the church officials and how they mentally abuse their congregation, especially women. Really a dark story, but it definitely leaves an impression."
4,"Good stuff, but............","This CD is good quality and Authentic Irish music at a very good price. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought there would be more drum music in it, considering the title."
4,Great performance - hard to find,"This recording is very good and the Martinu play very well. This is the first Vranicky that I had ever heard. The local radio station played one piece from this that engendered my search for it. I was happy with the purchase, but it took a while just to find it at a reasonable price. There are some memorable melodies here and some interesting textures, if not the brilliance of some other 18th and 19th century European composers."
3,a bit too trashy,"While I like the basic story of this woman, I have a problem with her behavior, especially as a mother of a local police officer and herself a former D.C. cop. Her manner of dress, loose sexual behavior and aggressiveness is contradictary to those roles. Clay must have been embarassed by his mother. I found her actions hard to accept as plausible as well as those of her sister. Missing for 18 years without a single contact. I can't accept that. The Russian guy was a bit too much to believe also. Slightly too far fetched to be believeable."
1,Boring - when does this book begin? Too descriptive,"I am still awaiting the plot to thicken in this book, I'm more than 1/2 way through and ""it ain't happening""! Too descriptive for my taste - totally boring book"
4,recommended!,I had no idea what to expect when I picked up this book - I'd never heard of Tawni O'Dell. I was very pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to read her other two books. The characters and plot were great and I enjoyed learning so much about coal mining.
5,Loved it!,This is the first book I've read by Tawni O'Dell (don't know how I missed her) and I enjoyed it so much that I just ordered her first two books. Can't wait for them to arrive. Highly recommend!
3,"Great beginning, lost momentum at the end","I really enjoyed the first half of this book. Great, snappy dialogue, wonderful characters. I definitely enjoyed a sexy, good looking heroine over the age of 40! (Sex does not end at 30!). After a very enjoyable build up, the ending just fizzled. I would have rated the book much much higher if I hadn't been so disappointed in the ending.*minor spoilers ahead* While I appreciated the main character's sex appeal, I was put off by her promiscuity - 2 lovers in the same day, no protection in either case. How hard is it for the author to have the heroine pull a condom out of her purse?"
5,Thunderbird 36-Amp ESC,This a very good ESC for the price. I fly two of them now with no issues at all.
2,Okay if a little fading is needed,I purchased this product the first week of february and was hopeful that the spider veins on the outside of my thighs would vanish. The product promises to rid u of spider veins...it doesn't do that. The most I've seen is slight fading of one of my several but none has diasappeared. It is now April and I've gone through two jars. The product says it may take up to six months to see results but by then you'll be out some cash.
2,I can't tell a difference.,"I've used this for a month now and really can't tell a difference...it feels good when you apply it to the skin, but in terms of reducing the appearance of reticular or spider veins, I really have not found it to be effective."
1,Not good,"This product did nothing for my spider veins. The lotion is in a very small container 2.5 oz. The container is so small you might get 10 days use, if you have lot of spider veins less than that.. The lotion really smells bad too. I picked one spot on my leg and concentrated on that spot every time I used the lotion. Never saw the slightest improvement. I also took the pill recommended with this product and ""no"", nothing there either. Please do not waste your money, save up if you can and go laser.."
1,caused breakouts,I am Jeremy's wife...I put this on three times a day for about a week and then my legs got a bumpy rash on all the areas I had put the cream on. The rash is still there and it's five days after I stopped using it. I have never had an allergic reaction to any cream or lotion before.... this stuff seems toxic.
4,"beautiful example of ""Conduction""","Butch Morris made a significant contribution to music with his practice of ""Conduction"" -- spontaneous composition (not quite ""improvisation) for ensembles of any makeup, by a conductor using a well-defined vocabulary of hand signals. Dust to Dust is a beautiful example of Morris at work with musicians who understand his technques well, and also contains some of his enduring composed lines, such as ""The Long Goodbye."" Extra added attraction: Butch plays cornet throughout some tracks. This music is not ""conventional"" in any sense, but it is extremely satisfying to people who have open ears and like to follow the flow."
5,Great Advice for Sales & Marketing Managers,"It would be very difficult to read more than a couple of pages without being challenged on your management approach or to be reminded of a proven solution to a problem. Managers of sales and marketing operations will find creative ways to approach their craft as well as those devices and methods that have always worked (and always will). Written in bite-sized chunks, you might find it helpful to simply meditate on one concept per day. They all apply to the successful management of sales and marketing. If you apply these principles, you will be successful. It's as simple as that."
1,For those who give this item good reviews....wait,"Up until yesterday I would have given this player 5 stars (as I see some customers have). But now I have a nice silver paperweight on my electronics stand. Because I wasn't as lucky as some (to have the unit die after a couple of months) I have passed my warranty and would have to shell out another $188 for an ""exchange."" That sounds more like buying another DVD player and shipping them mine to ""fix"" and send to another poor sap for another $188. DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE IT IS FLAWED!"
2,not what i expected from a sony,"i had the same problem as the previous reviewer. after 2 weeks of fine playback, the player suddenly wouldn't play my dvd's. i also couldn't eject the disc unless i turned it off, then turned it on. ended up returning the player since it was within the 30 days. i also had the same problem with the samsung 841 player. i own a sony 60xbr950. i've heard about problems with dvi connections? i had to go with a hdmi/dvi monster cable. maybe a hdmi/hdmi connection might be alright.i own all sony products, and this is the first time i was not satisfied with a sony. the picture was great while it was working...but to be honest, the picture with my sony rdrhx900 recorder/player (component video) is just as good. i'll stick with the component video till they work out the bugs with the dvi connections."
3,upscaling only works from HDMI output,"I bought this DVD player because the advertised video upscaling. But please be careful that the video upscaling is only from the HDMI interface and NOT from the component video interfance. I returned it since my HDTV is SONY KD34XBR2 from two and half years ago and didn't have the HDMI interface. I was a little disappointed because that ""HMDI only video upscaling"" is not clearly described in Sony's marketing sheet. I found this out by reading the user's manual and a clear product description from Crutchfield."
2,Great picture while it lasts,"I bought this DVD player because it has an HDMI connection. On a 55-inch flat panel HDTV, the picture exceeded my expectations. I watched the movie ""Hero"" on it and the picture was crisp and the colors were both true and breathtaking. The player, however, cut off midway through the film. Fortunately, it relented in its malfunction just long enough to allow me to finish watching the movie. Afterwards, no matter what disc I put in the player, it erroneously recognized it a ""multitrack,"" churlishly refused to play and obstinately locked up. I did as I recommend all people do who have had the misfortune to adopt children who are churlish, obstinate or should be locked up - I sent it back.I have replaced this player with the Denon 2910. Even though this player costs more than twice as much as the Sony, the picture on the Sony was just as good, while it was there . . ."
3,Great picture but hope it does not break,"Three weeks after I purchased this unit, the player developed problems playing DVDs and opening the drawer. Because I mail ordered the unit, I had to return it to the Sony Repair Center. Since it was withing the first 30 days, they said they would ship out a new unit. When I filled out an online return, they said a replacement would be shipped out in 5-7 days. When it didn't show up, customer service stated it would take 10-14 days at the minimum. I like the player. Hopefully, some day I will be able to use it.I'd recommend purchasing Sony products from a local store as you could probably get an exchange within the first 30 days."
1,Absolute crap! How the mighty have fallen.,"Sony of old is gone. The new sony is just plain crap. This DVD player is the best example of how horrible they have become. less than 5 months, very light use and it's DEAD. To replace it I have to pay $33+.Avoid!Sorry Sony, but I simply don't trust your products anymore."
3,Seems good,"Looks like Sony did a little 'biting' off of the Samsung design. Then again, I wonder if the two companies are together. I recall that Samsung supports memory sticks....It could also be why the Samsung did not come out yet..."
1,Great while it lasts . . . but it doesn't,"I bought this player on 12/20/2004 and have used it heavily until last night, 5/28/2006, when it inexplicably just quit on me. Online research has revealed that this unit suffered widespread firmware issues. Mine is now out of warranty and I can pay $182 to have it exchanged for a refurbished unit ""of comparable value"" or $133 to ship it out for repair. No thanks, Sony.It's too bad - it really was a great player while it worked but I'm not going to sink $133 more into technology that is two years old. My last Sony player cost less than this one and was eventually replaced after 4 years just because it was so old school (non-progressive). What's up with that, Sony?"
4,Balderdash,"I read a lot of the reviews of this and they don't square with my personal experiences nor many reviews.Picture quality is very good to excellent and I have had absolutely no problems with the player. WHy not five stars? Simple, having to still use analog cables for SACD output is clumsy and expensive, music is very good, excellent on SACD.I even noticed one of the ""reviewers"" paid over list price for this player. Had it break, golly its under warranty, so get it fixed."
1,My $25 DVD play in my kids room works better,"We paid $300 for this piece of junk. We hardly ever used it, and now it won't play DVD's and won't open. In reading the reviews, it seems to be a widespread problem. I was told by Sony, and I quote, ""this is a rare case. This DVD Player has received rave reviews from the customers."" Apparently they haven't been reading the same reviews I have!DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT and seriously consider NOT buying a Sony DVD player. They aren't reliable and Sony won't admit that they have a problem."
1,The HDMI output will ONLY work with HDCP compliant Monitors,"Yet another reason NOT to buy this poorly designed DVD player. Sony has doubled the price of this DVD player after it included a HDMI digital output capability. However, the encryption is turned ON all the time! This means you can NOT feed the digital input of ANY monitor thta does NOT HDCP compliant. You must use the old fashioned component or S-Video inputs with your expensive digital flat panel monitor."
2,Seemed great but quality and stability issues...,"I was very impressed by the audio and video this unit provided for me. However am very disappointed with the quality of the hardware. After only 6 months the unit started acting up... door wouldn't open at first then it just started shutting off at random. Tried all Sony's proposed solutions to no avail. Had to send the unit back (pay for my own shipping) and am still waiting (over a week now) for the ""replacement"" unit, which I fear will go south on me too. It's really to bad since the unit truly is impressive (when it worked).Based on all the other similar complaints i would think Sony would want to provide an exchange program or recall and save some face with there customer base."
1,Worst. Sony. Ever.,"Died after 9 months of light use. It's true: Sony quality is a thing of the past. I used to pay a premium for Sony products. Once it was worth it, but not anymore. Go with another manufacturer."
1,"Don't try and watch ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane""","Upconverted video looks very smooth and filmlike, but any non-anamorphic disk will not play properly over the HDMI connector as it will stupidly be stretched to fill full widescreen rather than window-paned with black bars on left and right. This is just unacceptable. Sony, I'm disappointed in you."
1,"This thing is JUNK DON""T BUY IT",I bought this SONY dvd player on 02/24/05 and it just died on me on 05/08/05 it's got my new $30 dvd stuck in it. I bought it because i got a new SONY TV and i wanted it all the same name and it looked good.I should have bought the SAMSUNG one don't buy this SONY DVP-NS975V you'll be sorry you did i had a cheap PANASONIC one that played better than this one. This should be recalled i payed $314.97 for this and im sorry i did now now it's a paper weight what junk now i got to look for a new one and it will not be SONY.
1,It really does not explain how to build a wine cellar,"At best, I would recommend this at the end of a very long reading list of wine cellar construction books, as it touches on some odd facts and eccentricities, especially concerning the physics of wine cellar construction. It seems to practically ignore the fact that most wine cellars are made with a foam barrier, automated refrigeration, and humidification/de-humidification systems, making his techniques of measuring soil temperatures for passive wine cellars practically obsolete. It is not organized very logically, spending long periods of time obsessing over hand-drawn formulas that are clearly the work of an intelligent man but not very pragmatic or applicable to ""building your own wine cellar,"" which is ostensibly the purpose of the book. It does practically nothing to help you build your own wine cellar."
2,Needs updating to the 21st century,I found only 25% of the book contained any relevant information. However this information was very useful. I'll be looking for a newer version
5,Excellent How to Build a Wine Cellar,This book is a must for anyone considering building a wine cellar. The book is very complete and describes exactly what is required to build a wine cellar in an easy to understand format.There is also information on how to buy wine and why.
2,how & why to build a wine cellar,"not what i was hoping for. virtually no plans on actual racking of any kind. gives the why's, not the how."
2,"Dated material, needs modern design illustrations","This book was published in 1986. I have no doubt the author is well qualified on the subject matter. However, because the book is so old the author provides no modern useful drawings with current building materials or information on modern cooling devices. The book would benefit from diagrams and drawings that any engineer would use in preparing a text on building. The book disappoints in this regard."
5,The Source,"If you are planning to build or are building a wine cellar you need this book, it is the source. Dr. Gold draws on his experiences and research in building his own cellar and offers clear explanations as to the ""why's"" and concise specifications for the ""how's"". I bought edition 3 for myself and my contractor to guide the construction of my passive cellar that has maintained a steady 54 degrees thru its first winter and 60 degrees thru the summer.Picked up edition 4 to see what's new - updates on newest construction materials and new information on sourcing wines and wine info thru the internet."
3,"Great, But",I do believe that this is the best authority on the theory of building a wine cellar. Practical building advice is slim. Drawings of wall and insulation use are rudimentary at best. You will learn the importance of outside soil temperatures but no guidelines on what they may be in different regions of the country. This is a great book but it will leave you with questions. Not a step by step guide.
4,Wine Cellar Cautions,"I was giving serious consideration to building my wine cellar and decided to perform some research. The Gold book was by far, the most in-depth and informative material I read. A little high-brow in places but extremely thorough. Actually, I got freaked-out and never did build the cellar. My wife really frowned upon the idea of digging up the front yard to lay down a plastic barrier. When I suggested we drill into the concrete floor to create a dry-well, she took my last bottle of Haut Brion, poured it into the pasta sauce and said, ""There- no need for a cellar now do we?"" The book was over the top, scared the ba-gee-bees out of me and still, after 2 years of thinking about it, I haven't built the cellar. Good book, read it and make your own decisions."
3,Good enough for a light boat,For the price it's an OK buy. I honestly expected it to be a bit more sturdy especially being that Reese is a brand name I felt I could trust for quality. When it is not being used it seems a bit flimsy. When in use it leans a little from the weight. I would have expected that the swivel would be much tighter. For a light Jon boat it will probably be fine. Of course I was shopping for price and I got what I paid for.
3,Reese?,"Is it a Reese jack? Reese is a known name in trailer products, but there was no Reese insignia or labels, just a plain jack. It is rated at 1000 lbs, but it's too early to tell how long it will last (tongue weight is 800 lbs.) After attaching it to the trailer I noticed it was very loose at the swivel, more wobble than most and there wasn't a grease fitting at the cylinder(it wasn't a sealed system.) I will be very happy if it lasts the season. You get what you pay for. At least, it was shiny."
1,"Looks good, but is very poor quality","As I assembled this swivel trailer tongue jack, I noticed that component parts were missing. After installon the unit on my trailer I noticed that there is lots of play in the unit. I would not recommend this product."
3,Easier on my back,"This is a great idea poorly executed. It seems to be heavy duty construction which is nice, and it is galvenized so it 'should' last a while. The 2 things that let it down are the wheel, which is a light duty plastic thing, and the swivel joint which allows the jack to flex while I push the trailer around my back yard. It shouldn't be flexing at all.The ground in my yard is soft, so the hard plastic wheel easily digs in and gets caught. Overall not a terrible product and gets the job done...but would I buy it again? Really not sure. I did buy one years ago in Australia for $20 which was far superior to this...but that's a long way to go for a jockey wheel."
4,"Great jack, bad instructions","This jack works perfectly for my jon boat trailer, feels nice and solid and does its job. My only two complaints would be the small handle that came with it and the instructions. I think I am fairly handy with tools so I really didn't have much problem installing this jack, but the directions didn't seem clear at all to the different ways you can install this. For this and the small handle it came with I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise a good jack for the price. (Note: after buying this on amazon I saw the same jack for the same price at walmart, may be worth calling a Walmart to see if its near you.)"
5,Great addition to my utility trailer!,I bought a utility trailer from Tractor Supply and it had no jack up front. I hated the idea of the front just sitting in the dirt. I quickly bolted this up with no issues. Works as advertised and Amazon had a great price at the time of purchase.
4,Review of Reese Trailer Jack,"The Reese Trailer Mount Jack Arrived within two days per Amazon Prime, product was well packaged and arrived without damage. It is silver color painted not chrome as appears in the picture. It is a good sturdy wheeled jack and went on easily and seems to work well! Would by again."
4,"quality, easy to install, solid",the headline says it all you wil be content with t he pur chase..teh spelling is deliberate to get minimum words in
5,Reese Trailer Swivel Mount Jack,Jack is very good quality for the price and was easy to install. Jacks works great. Shipment was received quickly and with very good packaging.
2,OK - IF TRAILER IS EMPTY,I HAVE NOW HAD THIS ON MY TRAILER FOR OVER A YEAR AND THE 3 STAR RATINGS COVER MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE DESIGN. SWIVLE WHEEL IS THE WEAK POINT OF THIS. WOULD I BUY IT AGAIN - NO.
5,Packs a Punch!,"When I first knew Dorothy O'Donnell Uhlman, I did not know that I would one day be congratulating her on her ""writing""! As my mentor would say, she uses an ""economy"" of words! She packs a punch! Barbara Murray Klopp, Children's Author"
5,Great product.,"I may be a neat freak, but i like this stuff. I'm redoing my garage cabinets and i put down Duck Liner. It keeps my tools in place when i open up draws. I like it because now all my tools go back exactly where they came from and don't shift around. It also helps to not scuff up your draws. Works as advertised."
5,Double Fighter Knight,"This is the World War 2 history of Finland's greatest fighter pilot and his accounts of his astounding 94 combat victories against the Soviet Air Force. In the great air battles over eastern Finland he he scored 21 victories in the month of June 1944 alone. In almost constant combat from the Fall of 1939 to summer of 1944, he remarkably, never took a single bullet in his planes from an enemy fighter. For his great achievements he twice received the Knighthood of the Mannerheim Cross, Finland's highest military honor. His book was edited by Heikki Nikunen, former commander of the Finnish Air Force; and Admiral Paul Gilcrist, US Navy carrier fighter pilot. Admiral Gilcrist cites Juutilainen as one of the most successful and deadly aerial tacticians in the entire history of military aviation."
2,Disappointing,I find Thelma Hall's Too Deep for Words a much better short introduction to lectio divina.
4,Great alongside travel guides,"Used this map on our last two trips and found it to be a useful tool alongside our travel guides. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the map can be somewhat ""busy."" You probably could tour the island alone with the map, but a good guide like 'Maui - Mile by Mile' is perfect with this map."
2,"good map, but not needed","I was in Maui for the first time so I bought this map. I was there two weeks and never used it. Maui is a really easy place to get around, and you're actually better off without the map and exploring a bit on your own. The map itself looked great, and I'm sure some people love it. I, however, found it unneccessary."
4,Very Interesting,"As a Chinese living in America, I found this book very interesting. True, not all French people dislike Americans. But it is also true the differences between American and French people toward food and eating style are part of reasons why 60% of adult Americans are overweight. This book reminded me how much Chinese and French are alike in some aspects, and how much American culture influences has impact on both French people and Asians. I enjoy reading her two books. It gave me different points of view on different cultures."
5,Harriet does it again!,Another tour de force from the author of French Toast! The flavor of France is vividly captured and she makes it easy to understand why so many of us who discovered this wonderful country have never left it. Tired of ingesting garbage that calls itself food? You'll never do it again once you have read French Fried.
2,"Fonville is wonderful, Reynolds is mediocre","John Fonville, the flute soloist on Transfigured Wind II is quite good. Sollberger and the San Diego Symphony Ensemble do a nice job on the performance, too. The computer generated tape was masterfully created by Reynold's graduate student TA's although they received no credit for the thousands of hours that they put into the project. ""Whispers Out of Time"" won a Pulitzer Prize and is quite an ugly work - formless, void, ponderous, uninteresting. Roger Reynolds is a legend in his own mind, without the ears or imagination of a decent journeyman musician. Nonetheless, the disc is worth getting just for Fonville and Transfigured Wind II which is an excellent work. I guess that even a broken clock is right twice a day!"
2,Your Usual Amateur Black Spring Break Documentary..HO HUM,"Well the camera work was shotty and the filmmaker didn't shoot the things, a viewer would want to see, thru out the whole thing it seemed like he or she didn't even know what they were filming, PLUS everything was shot at nighttime in nightvison almost, that sucks. As a spring break film you need to focus on the women, the souped-up rides ( not the regular rides, unless there are a group of females in them), the type characters you see there and the parties and activities. This person clearly didn't do that. The only good part was the last 2 minutes of the dvd, which was like a quick collection of clips of the things you wanted, and also you can see this part by itself labeled as a bonus video."
1,Cheaper for a reason,"Dr.Natura is more expensive but MUCH higher quality. This stuff was like stirring sand, never mixed with the water, just sat in the bottom of the cup. I was able to gag one serving down before I threw this crap away."
1,"Doesn't work on my HP color laser printer, ruins printer","I see a previous review that says it works perfectly on CP1518ni. Unfortunately that's not my experience. My new HP CP1518ni color laser printer prints fine on regular paper, but on this paper the ink doesn't seem to stick. There are large areas where the ink has been wiped off the paper as the paper rolls through the printer mechanism. What's more, if I subsequently print on regular paper, the next one or two pages have ink on the back side of the paper, which means this paper is probably ruining the printer too."
2,Not really that great,"It may be just me but, it seems like every ""HP"" product I have ever purchased has given me nothing but problems and this photo paper is about the same. First time I ran it through my laser printer it totally melted to the inside of the imaging drum of the printer and caused a major jam. I told myself I would never buy another ""HP"" product again as long as I live. Hopefully if you decide to buy these you will have better luck than I did."
1,Didn't work at all with my generic compatible HP toner cartridges.,"When I tried to print a photo with my Generic/Remanufactured compatible CP2025dn HP toner cartridges, I got a smeared image and had to clean out my printer. Don't know if this was because of the toner cartridges or the paper. Now I buy only Genuine HP Toner, but have yet to try to print a photo on this paper."
4,Pricey but as advertised.,This product was hard to find in brick and mortor retail. Gald I found it here. Just what I ordered.
1,HORRIBLE LASER PHOTO PAPEr!,"This is the worst photo paper I have ever purchased. I do not have an HP Laser printer, and the ink was smeared everywhere, even on the back of the following page. For some reason this paper can not hold the ink. Not only did it affect subsequent printings, but I wasted so much ink, and therefore, money. What a crappy product. Horrible quality."
2,Image is not this product,"Please note, the image in this add IS NOT the packaging for the product you will receive. It is the 200g paper, Q6608A (many HP printers will only handle up to 170g), but the packaging I received did not say 'photo paper', rather it says 'brochure paper'. My first thought was that the vendor sent me the wrong paper; although the description and product number is correct it is in a different package."
1,Not what I wanted!!!!,"This item is listed as GLOSSY COLOR LASER PHOTO PAPER but, it is actually semi glossy brochure paper. I was looking for some nice glossy photo paper to print photos from time to time and this does not cut it. Won't order this again as I might as well throw it away."
2,Not good for the Samsung 310 series color laser,"This paper looks and feels to be good quality, but it did not perform at all with my Samsung 310-series laser printer. The ink variously smudged, lifted, smeared and flat out refused to adhere to the paper. It worked out much better in my Kodak inkjet (where I have had no issues with any type of paper). Apparently this paper was designed only to work with HP ink and printers, so if you are using any laser printer other than an HP, do not invest in this product."
2,"Geronimo Stilton is a negative, winey wimp","I started reading the Geronimo Stilton books to my 7 year old son to try to get him more interested in reading. The books are well written. My sons enjoys books, but the more of them you read the more you realize that Geronimo Stilton is not a good infulence. We curently on book #9 and this it no more.Geronimo Stilton is constantly complaining and wining. He is pushed around and manipulated by his sister, his cousin, and to a certain extent his sweet little nephew. The books are very formulaic. In almost every book I have read so for our hero, Geronimo Stilton, is dranged into an adventure kicking and screaming like a two year old throwing a fit. He eventually has fun in the end but on the way he excessly complains and wines the entire time. I have never read any childrens book before with phrase ""I hate .."" in it so many times. If you want a positive role infulence on your child through reading this isn't it."
3,Nine Year Old Wish,"For whatever reason, our nine year old granddaughter had several of these books on her Christmas wish list. She couldn't get enough of reading this author."
3,"Distracting print, but kids loved it...","Our kids read this as part of Reading Olympics, and most of them (in fourth and fifth grade) loved it because it was quick, easy, and colorful. However, I found it distracting to read as so much of the text was in different colors and had little gimmicks, like the word frozen made to look as though the text were cold. Cute...but there was too much of it.However, I can see the style of the book and the non-challenging (and uninteresting to me) story as being wonderfully attractive to reluctant readers."
1,Fonts are too small,"Very difficult for my son to read the story on kindle as fonts are too small for reading properly, and it cannot be adjusted like other books..."
4,A Silly Treasure Hunt,"The setting is at an island of the emerald eye. There is shining blue water and birds squeaking in the trees. There is soft sand and a crowd of people in the water. Geronimo , Trap, Benjamin and Thea were looking for lost treasure .They found the emerald eye a wonderful treasure. They were looking for hidden treasure . They found it at the end of the story the emerald eye. They had many problems like there ship sinking, falling in the quicksand running away from many bees. They could not find the treasure but they found it at the end of the story by using a map and they saw the emerald eye from the airplane. I think that this was the most funny and interesting story I have ever read! It was cool. And there were many exciting parts."
4,Keeps my daughter busy,"My daughter (11) loves all his books. It keeps her busy on our tablet when my husband and I need to attend a course and we take her with us - due to no babysitter.She loves it and I think those pictures are very nicely drawn, it is easy to read and just a nice relaxing reading for children."
1,horrible !!!,"I received those bra pads from my friend and she loved them. I hate them. They make my breasts hot and uncomfortable. I felt like wearing plastic shell. Yes it does not leak but the price is red, sweaty breasts... I will not buy them again."
3,Second-best nursing pads,"I have a box of these that I'm trying to use up. They are okay, but I would buy Lansinoh next time instead.For pros -- they are thin, so it doesn't bulk up your shirt as much.Cons -- more leakage problems with these than Lansinoh, notably at nighttime. They also tend to fold over onto themselves due to thinness. The plastic lining on each one is slightly thicker, making them tougher to open.I don't hate them; they're fairly decent. It's just that Lansinoh pads are much better at the job, in my opinion."
1,awful smell,"These pads develop a very unpleasant chemical-like smell every time they get wet. Also, the absorbency is not as great as you would think. I much prefer the cheaper alternatives like Lansinoh!"
2,"Doesn't stick well, tissue bunches up - I prefer Lansinoh!","I've tried both these and Lansinoh nursing pads, and these Medela pads pale in comparison. There's only a weak adhesive strip on one side of the pad, which means that they get dislodged easily, the tissue filling is thin and bunches up easily, which means that if the pad shifts (see weak adhesive), you don't get full coverage. Lansinoh's pads are much better - at the very least, they stay stuck on!"
1,Great if you like wearing a wad of newspaper in your bra!,"Medela makes great pumps but this product is TERRIBLE! They dont stick well, they bunch up inside your bra and feel (and sound) like paper! I bought them on sale and HATE them. I didnt even use them. Johnson &Johnson and Lansinoh are far better. But you get what you pay for with these :-("
2,Lansinoh is better!,These pads do not stay put! There is only one tiny adhesive area as opposed to the Lansinoh pads which have two adhesive tabs. By the end ofo the day they are totally bunched up. I also think they're annoyingly large -the edges stick out of my bra.
2,Great if like wearing a plastic bag,"They do contain leaks but the wrapping is a pain to open, and they feel like you are wearing a plastic bag in your bra. I prefer the lansinoh pads as they are less plasticy and more breathable."
5,Old School Art Theory,"If your interested in oil painting and the theories behind it, this book is for you. Written about 100 years ago, the author treats you as a student as he explains the various materials and methods for a successful painting. From early sketches, to rough studies, to completed works, you should find what your looking for here."
2,The Painter in Review,Good basic information. I wasn't familiar with this book when I ordered it. I didn't realize this was a 2006 release of a 1930 revision of a book published in 1898. Since I was looking for more up to date information the book is basically usless to me.
1,boring,the story was boring. the hero was boring and the heroine was boring. it was a waste of time and money.
3,Shipping not great,The poster was what I expected and I like it!The flat shipping envelope and the poster were bent in the mail. A round shipping tube would have worked better.I'll frame around the bent part.
4,Cattleman's Club continued,"This is a continuation of the Texas Cattleman's Club series. This is Forrest and Becky's story. Becky and Forrest have been friends and neighbors forever, but Becky has been in love with Forrest for years. Forrest suddenly decides it's time to settle down and, after some thought, decides to propose to Becky. He says that he's saving her from spinsterhood and Becky, of course, refuses him. She tells him that she's already engaged (a lie)because she's so insulted at his proposal. Forrest becomes jealous and tries to win Becky's affection."
2,I bot a good game .,"I like Ed ,Edd and Eddy / they where fun in the videos I looked at . But I could not run the game in my desk top . So the game was too old for me . Sorry"
1,Berware...Wrong Fit,"Ordered this for my 2010 corolla,says it fits but it does not. Save yourself aggravation when ordering and get correct part number off web first.."
3,Eraser,"To be honest, you get what you paid for. They work better for chalkboards than whiteboards. It will do the job with some power behind it. Not the best for kids. But if it's not an every day use, you should be fine."
5,"Disk 5 Air 07/11/38 ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker","We are now jaded by DVD's that tout extras and have information though lost for all time; or we get hindsight insights from authors and actors.This package of six audio CD's does the same for Orson Welles. We get not only to listen to great broadcasts but interviews and a feel for the commercials at the time such as Lux soap, and Blue Coal heating.I was surprised to find an interview of Orson Welles and H.G. Wells together in San Antonio.This collection comes with a 51 page supplemental pamphlet; the pamphlet contains pictures and descriptions of what we are listening to.I bought this package originally to hear Orson's rendition of ""Dracula."" However most people remember his ""War of the Words"" rendition."
3,Decent,"I don't listen to this too often, but when it comes up in shuffle mode, it's not bad to hear."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this toy for my two sons ages 5 and 3 and was quite disappointed. The ""silly string"" tends to shoot out in globs instead of in web-like form. The ""silly string"" container will last your child all about 5 minutes before you will need to replace it! I thought it was great that they included a water-gun attachement-type shooter but it stopped working by the 3rd refill for one of my son's. The gloves are quite large and I can hardly see where they would fit on a child's hand. The fingers of the gloves kept getting in the way of the silly-string/water shooting that I had to tape them down. I know the price of this toy isn't high but it's not worth the money either! Sorry!"
2,Unhappy Spiderman Fan,"This is definitely for older children. My 4 year old saved his birthday money and could not wait for this. It should have a different age group on it as the fitting is definitely for older children. It was even too big for my 6 year old. They loved the 'web' stuff, but it was gone quickly and we have not been able to find more. I would be very careful before choosing this fairly costly toy."
1,waste,my son really wanted this toy for christmas and sad to say it is a waste of money. the glove doesn't fit a childs hand the fluid doesn't even shoot out like a web then it has strong smell and is messy....it will also stain your clothes and walls. the person that thought of this toy had a great idea but the person that designed it wasn't in the right frame of mind.it's a piece of junk...very disappointing
2,fit for adults,My son was given this for his birthday. First of all it didn't come close to fitting a childs hand. It did fit all of the women at the party. The string is also very messy. It looks like silly string but does not clean up quite as easily. I would defenitely think twice before purchasing this toy.
1,wasted money,"The company that made this piece of junk should be ashamed of themselves for producing a very poor quality product that seriously fails to meet up with the expectations that are put forth to the public in deceptive advertising. If your child is under the age of 12, forget it because it will not even fit. As for the web, do yourself a favor and go buy some silly string; it will be much cheaper. The water pump has near-zero pressure which accomplishes a 1 foot stream of water. It is garbage like this product that gives so many toy companies a bad reputation."
3,Web Blaster - A Real Waste of Money,"I bought this for my grandson and he was so excited. After 5 min, he was out of web fluid. I cannot find refills. I am not sure who is more disappointed, my grandson bacause the toy is not what it appears to be or myself for wasting my money and building him for for a great toy!!"
1,This Stinks,"This was probably the biggest waste of my money this season. The web blasting fluid got clogged several times. When it was working the gloves are made so big that the fluid would squirt right onto the tips of the fingers and then go no further. When we used it with the water attachment, it kept falling off. I feel very bad because my seven year old son was so looking forward to playing with this and using his ""super powers"" and it was nothing but a big disappointment."
1,WEB BLASTER IS DANGEROUS!!!,"My son got some web in his eyes and this toy, the box, the can, and the instructions did not indicate active ingredients whatsoever, and we had to bring him to the emergency room. The glove does not fit and you cannot direct the spray. It is pure junk. Save your money and your kid's eyes."
1,Disappointing!,"The idea for this toy is cool....but once you get it home and try it, it's not what it's cracked up to be! The glove was way to big for my son and the silly string just hit his finger tips. So I had to tape all the fingers down so that it could spray. The cans of silly string ran out in about 10 minutes of playing with them. You are going to go through alot of money fast...too fast! The water blaster part was even worse. The water wouldn't spray out very well...sometimes it wouldn't come out at all. We returned it!"
5,They started good and continue to excel,Favez has yet to put out a bad record. This one is no exception.
5,Love This Rice!,"I was introduced to Jasmine rice when I was in California. I did not know what a difference there is between rices. I also like the fact that it is grown in the USA...in Texas. Product is always good, cooks perfectly, and is light and flavorful. Just can't find a better Jasmine rice anywhere. HIghly recommend."
4,It's Alright!,Hunts Katchup is not the brand of katchup that we normally use but it's not bad and seems to be the brand of katchup that is used in many fast food establishments. My one complaint is that its just a touch to sweet.
2,Bath tub scene,As a whole the movie blows. The only redeeming thing is a scene in which Hauser is shot at while taking a bath. He must exit the tub (naked).
3,Nice Scope with Plastic in all the Wrong Places,"OTA scope seems fine, but the EQ tripod itself is constructed of plastic where it counts most -- at the moving joints. The leg tensioner broke on the 1st night out. Need to find a quality used mount as a replacement."
2,9 Songs,A couple of good sex scenes bracketted with terrible music. I would not have purchased the item had someone given me this review.
3,It was okay,"The music & some of the filming was good but I feel as though I was not given anything new by this film. I have no problem with actual sex scenes but I need substance in them. I need to feel that one of them was more in charge, more experienced and by all means give me some emotion! They didn't have to even be in love. I needed them to need something more from each other. I needed this film to provoke and awaken me. It did not. It felt like I was just looking at your average sexual relationship between 2 people who have barely experienced anything. tying one up and getting a lap dance from a women does not make a sex life cutting edge. mixing sexual adventure and sexual awaking with emotional & psychological warfare would have made the film really stand out and really mean something.just my little opinion."
3,Erotic but scattered and noisy adult film,"Some good adult scenes but band sequences way to haphazard, skittish, and confusing in story line - too blasting noisy too. Good and very intimate interactions between lead characters esp. in finale!"
4,Sex and Rock and Roll.,"Daring. If movies are as uninhibited as this movie is(although this cuts to the chase on the sex part as it could have more romance before sex). It reminded me of the movie ""Intimacy"". Sex and more sex plus Alternative rock, it can't get any better. x"
2,Sex and drugs and sex and rock 'n' roll.... and sex,"It's not easy to review this movie objectively. On the positive side, it is a refreshingly honest depiction of an intimate relationship, spliced with some OK-ish music and a few brief, stunningly beautiful scenes of Antarctica.What will the film be remembered for though? The sex of course, which is certainly every bit as explicit as you've heard.Apart from a few amusing snippets of dialogue, I didn't particularly warm to the characters though. Matt is pretty dull and doesn't come over as intellectual enough to convince as a scientist, whereas Lisa is selfish, concerned primarily with her own pleasure.Michael Nyman's piano piece was good (but irritatinly truncated). So what is there after the shock value of the sex? Not a huge amount.I expect viewers will buy this out of curiosity. Watch it once then cast it to the back of a drawer.Sure it breaks new ground, and in that respect it has a certain importance, but it's no masterpiece.Caveat emptor."
1,Calling this art?!!,"I am generally fond of most movies many critics find fault with... However on this one I have to agree with the majority of the negative reviews I have read. The acting (Or attempt at being real and true to life.) is horrible. Although I will say that Kieran O'Brien is relatively natural in his role, Margo Stilley however should be banned from going in front of a camera for the rest of her life... Yes it was that bad. And as far as those of you looking for a erotic film, look elsewhere because there is nothing overly erotic about this film and you would be better purchasing an adult video, nor is there anything remotely groundbreaking or artistic. All you have is two people on screen whose attempts at improvisation are juvenile at best. I hate to be so critical of a film especially when the director was truly trying for something new and special, it's just unfortunate how he fell so far short."
2,Not worth my time,"My husband recommended this movie to me while he was deployed, so I purchased and watched it. First of all, there is practically no storyline. It's like a bad porn movie without the pornographic aspect of it. Yes, there are explicit sex scenes in this movie, and on first glance, that's what appealed to my husband. But, the characters are awful, the storyline is non-existent...even the soundtrack is bad. Upon further investigation, my husband agreed with me on all these points, and would no longer recommend it, either."
3,Hot Sex Scenes!,"I thought the sex scenes that Margo Stilley did in this movie were hot scenes that's why I gave this film 3 stars. However, the actors perfomances were not all that great. If you rate the movie by it's sex then I'd say great sex scenes. But if you rate the movie by the acting and story I say it lacks in that area. In my opinion the acting was moderate, and the actors performances could have been better."
2,dstick15,If you like loud music and sex scenes as boring as late nite T&A movies this is for you. Had to fast forward thru most of the movie to try to find something interesting. A real YAWNER!!!!
2,"9 songs, but it felt like there were 20.","All this movie is, is a mediocre band playing, with softcore scenes spliced in between. Well, mostly softcore.The movie seemed like there was nothing said in it. I know there was stuff said, because I was there, but all of the script seemed meaningless.I can't give only one star to a movie with a prominently-featured, hot naked chick in it. But I can't think of anything else positive about this movie."
3,Mis-Titled-Only 8.5 Songs,This is a hardcore adult movie with music mixed in. It's also a lesson about the dangers of co-dependency.
2,boring movie!,"I regret ever buying this movie! If you're looking for a porno flick, then this is one for the books. Otherwise I would not recommend it to anyone. Big disappointment!"
2,"A hot, edgy premise doesn't necessarily mean a hot, edgy film","You'd think that a short movie that alternates between edgy, alternative music performances and extended sex scenes between two young people would at the very least be minimally engaging, but I found ""9 Songs"" to be fairly dull. The music is murkily shot from the cheap seats, the presumably high resolution video photography doesn't seem very high-res at all, and the two young people just aren't very interesting as movie characters. The girl is kind of cute, I'll give the movie that, and some genuine steaminess seeps into the proceedings here and there. But the smattering of good sex is done in by inane acting, frequent dull stretches, and mostly unmemorable music. If sexy indie film fare is your occasional cup of tea, you could do a lot better. The DVD has a fair amount of special features, but my lack of enthusiasm for the movie has thus far kept me from watching many of them."
2,Huh?,This movie was very hard to follow. The only thing I got was the fact thatshe left him at the end. I didn't care for it too much.
1,WARNING: THIS IS NOT CAPTIONED NOR SUBTITLED!,"despite the assertions that it is captioned and subtitled, it is NEITHER. i rented this and wasted my $$ because of this deception!"
3,HOW DID THIS PORN SLIP BY?,"I AM NEW TO THE "" FOREIGN FILM "" SCENE, AND AS I GET OLDER- I THOUGHT I'D EXPOSE MYSELF TO SOMETHING A BIT MORE CEREBRAL. WELL- IF THIS IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS "" FILM "" AND NOT A MOVIE- I'M IN TROUBLE. I KNOW ENOUGH NOT TO KNOCK SOMEONES ART- BUT THIS MOVIE DEFIFNITELY IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. I REALLY LOOKED FORWARD TO THE MUSIC CONCERTS BEING WOVEN INTO THE PLOT. BUT I WAS TERRIBLY DISTRACTED BY THE GRAPHIC SEX WITH PENETRATION AND EJACULATION TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF THE "" FILM"". THIS WAS DEFINITELY AN ADULT MOVIE WITH AN ATTEMPT TO HAVE A STORYLINE/BELIEVABLE PLOT SPRINKLED IN. I EITHER HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT FOREIGN FILMS....OR FOREIGN FILM MAKERS HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE GOES FOR...AND THIS AINT IT."
1,how not to make a movie that incorporates real sex,"I like art house films. I like the idea of using real sex to tell a story- if it a story worth telling.This movie has no story. This movie has no characters really, simply songs and sex.This movie could've worked had there been an actual script, character development, and some cinematography. There was none of that.The concert scenes were uninteresting. The sex scenes were cold and yet the audience is supposed to believe that Matt actually loves Lisa. There's no emotion between the two, no sense of attachment, no feeling that they even like each other.Many people argue that this movie isn't porn but I completely disagree. I think the director had a vision that was good in his head but failed on screen. There are far sexier, more erotic, more romantic movies out there and I'd highly recommend you not waste your money to see what the hoopla was all about it because that's all there is to this movie- sensationalism."
3,"Interesting premise, thin execution","I keep wanting to like movies like 9 Songs and Shortbus because I believe in the idea of them...but the reality doesn't ever live up to the concept. Yes, it's nice to see someone at least *try* to deal with sex -- real, actual sex -- in film. I only wish the story supporting the sex in 9 Songs wasn't so thin and forgettable.The main problem I had was not caring about the characters. We get no real sense of them -- why do they even like each other? What is the attraction besides being physically nice to look at? Without any sense of that, watching them have sex never rises above the level of spectacle -- it's interesting insofar as there is some novelty in watching people actually have sex without the self-conscious and moronic trappings of standard-issue porn -- but I never felt moved or connected. And that's a pity.I also wish the concert footage were better shot because there are some excellent bands and good songs featured. Oh well."
4,Its a cross-over film,"There were a few films in the 70's that used adult content in main-stream cinema thinking that a majority would accept it. Obviously, it never took off. 9 songs uses its adult content in a similar way. There are several hard core scenes, in this love story. Personally, I think it gives the film a certian... real-ness. Theres certain things in here that are tough to put together. Antartica, (did'nt get it.. symbolizes the isolation of the relationship..?? perhaps) The songs.. (dont see what if anything they mean here... ??..why these songs?) Its an enigmatic film. I watched it (short c.a. 1 hr & change), thought about it, then watched the director & actors interview(s). I think I gave it way more credit than it deserved. They wernt going for any of the concepts I thought they were going for.Nevertheless. A good film, even if it was an accident. 4.5 stars"
2,svae your coins,"this was on netflix. If the video alone was the cost of one month of netflix (trial), I still wouldn't purchase this video.."
3,OK,Was ok. Sex scenes were real. And the chick was kinda hot. Some of the scenens I could not believe what i was seeing. Should have showen more sex scenes. But the ending sex scene is really hot!!!!!
1,"Yes, but what is the main thrust of this movie...?","Damn! Sorry, I really can't help myself. So puerile and immature;a man of my age, what am I thinking?Anyway, I found this film really hard to penetrate. The storyline(such as it was) being quite bare, my mind just wandered and Ifound myself thinking about lots of other things. Sex, for example.And naughty bits of the body. And sex. Not music. Sex again.The characters were quite engaging (fairly often) and the storyline(such as it was) was quite bare and I found myself................This film is an oddity and I can well see how it divided the critics.I'm not sure where I stand on the subject at hand; for while the sexscenes were fairly tedious the central theme was weak and contrived.The nine songs were largely uninspiring and I failed to find anyconnection at all with them and the characters.What would have been nice was for this movie to blow me away.(sick, sorry)."
3,Relationships are boring,"There are some who have said that 9 Songs is a terribly boring porno flick. I have to disagree. The best part of this movie is how it showcases an actual relationship. There isn't that much excitement day to day in a lot of relationships. Things get boring. The sex and common interests are what hold them together, and that is what this movie focuses on. I call this a romantic movie about two people joined by their love of music, and the bands used in the movie are amazing. The songs become the soundtrack of their relationship. As far as the sex scenes, they are intense and just about every other scene involves some sort of physical encounter. They didn't make me feel as though I was watching a cheap porno, however, but more that it was a normal part of any relationship. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys great cinematography, live music, or examinations of real relationships."
1,misleading,"Dull story, decent music, absolutely NO sex. I'd rate this a 'very mild hotel' version of a supposedly hot movie. There are numerous breast and butt shots of the female lead but that's about it. Why would they label this movie 'unrated' when it really should be labeled 'heavily edited to remove anything remotely erotic'. Very misleading and disappointing. Send me the postage and you can have this piece of crap."
1,Concert Go-ers have sex,"..and there you go. That's the entire movie. There is no substance or merit within this film what-so-ever.This is NOT an art film. It is not controversial and/or thought provoking at all. This belongsin the trash. Sure, it's graphic, but it's not even obscene enough to be entertaining. Good Music. Bad Movie.Really horrible...and I like great Bad Movies."
1,"As the call, so the echo...","If you want to get something back - you have to put something in, either thought, or feeling, or hard work, or imagination, something. If you have none of this - you got nothing in a result. Director in his intervew mentioned that he has no script, but just wanted to make a love story, improvising. But then at least a Love should be there to improvise around. But what we see - just casual boring copulation without feelings (from both sides). Eyes are empty, time they spend together is doleful. Hardly believe that such relationship will be remembered in a couple years - memories will be melted away with the next spring waters. Even rock music (which is also pretty averaged) , cocaine and explicit details doesn't add emotions to this plain, causal, pointless movie. Another example that if a person have nothing to say - no tricks will make his creation an Art."
3,its OK,didn't like the story much. too much rock and roll. There's an incredible penetration scene towards the end of the film. Was quite surprised with that. could have merited an x-rating. good sex scenes.
4,This is real,"This is a movie which depicts what life for the young,free and beautiful is about; sex, party and just fun.There is sex here and it's good sex....there is not much to learn here, just a few lessons to those who have a grudge to bear against those who are young and just want to live life uncomplicated.This is a Big recommend from me...good to watch with a gal pal who doesn't care too much for big named block busters but enjoys a simple good movie."
3,Won't Play on PCs,"Leaving aside the films content and notoriety, I was unable to get the DVD to play on my PC using any of the following software: Power DVD, QuickTime Pro, or RealPlayer. Perhaps they've encoded it to prevent PC play."
4,Hot movie,I was suprised by this movie in many ways. The concept was interesting with the music blending in with the sex scenes. The sex scenes were surprising as well especially when the female actor gives the male actor fellatio and brings him to ejaculation. You don't see that in non-porn movies which makes me think this could be considered a porn movie after all. No wonder I liked it.
3,9 Songs,I had no preconceived idea other than the reviews online. I didn't hate it. I would say it was ok.
2,boring,"The couple live on hot sex (xxx) and live concert. Between hard-ons and concerts, the film is boring. But this is my point of view."
4,A real sleeper,"Not a sleeper in a sense that it was bad, this movie was one I thought was going to be one of those boring movies. I actually watched it 2 times the first day and shared it with friends."
2,"Too soft to be porn, too hard to pay attention","This is a story of images. The dialog consists of about 2 pages worth of material so don't expect there to be a lot of talking. The run down is basically Sex, concert, sex, concert, sex, concert.Admittedly the sex scenes are pretty sweet and filled with tender moments. They are tastefully if explicitly done. You really get the sense that you're watching a real couple make love, at times it feels almost voyeuristic and wrong.Sadly there is not much in the way of plot to this movie, and the concert scenes end up feeling more like filler material than actually contributing in a meaningful way to the film. I wouldn't recommend buying this film, if you're really intent on seeing it I would suggest to rent it. Weighing in at only 69 minutes long it's hardly worth spending more than 5 dollars for this film."
3,it ain't bad.......,i gotta say that i give the director of the film credit for trying to come up with a piece of work that FULLY explores intimacy ALL THE WAY. But this film falls short particularly on the emotional level. The physical level it's all there but something is missing otherwise. I didn't feel anything for the characters to be honest after i finished viewing the film. You could tell the guy falls more deeply for the girl but you don't walk away truly touched by the story. At least i didn't.All in all it was a good effort but unfortunately it falls short. Imagine what this film could've been.oh and the guy well...he's nice. ;)
4,Not for Mainstream US Theaters But.,"I purchased the Uncut version. Although I'm not up on my Current Rock n Roll.The concert footage was good.Just your Classic Boy meets Girl, Girl meets Boy and let the sparks fly.By America Studio Standards it would be condidered Porno, because they actually performed sex. However it is an honest depiction of that one relationship where you do love the person but do not get married and live happily ever after.The affair that will always going to be full of fond memories.I hope the young actress Margo Stilley did not sabotaged her future film career as a serious actress. She did a good Job and an overall good movie.Considering it basicly was a Film shot on a shoe string. It was well worth the purchase."
2,"Great sex, awful movie","I'm not sure what the difference is between a porno flick and a legitimate movie. Supposedly legitimate films have a plot. This movie claims to have a plot but it's hard to find. We know almost nothing about the characters, or how they got together or why they're together and through the course of the movie we never do learn anything about them except they love to have sex. We don't have any compelling reason to care about either of them. I guess this is considered an art film because the lighting is bad, it especially gets bad during the explicit sex scenes. The story consists of having sex intermixed with rock concert scenes. Somewhere in there they insert a few minutes of some kind of documentary with clips of Antarctica. The bottom line is the director did a great job of capturing some pretty hot and explicit sex that's better than most porno films but like porno films the plot is hard to find."
1,9 Songs DVD,Nice box but the DVD would not play on either of my DVD players. Region is correct but the players could not read the menu.
1,Mostly Porn,"I bought it for the curiousity factor and because I had heard that it was 'interesting'. I soon found my self fast forwarding through the concert sequences to get to the porn..and there was plenty...the 2 actors in the sex scenes are not exactly scene stealers but as porn actors, they get the job done. It really could have been more of a relationship piece except that the musical interludes just distracted me..."
2,Plot? What plot!,Misses the mark if it's aiming at uplifting soft porn to an artistic level. Does not match the hype.
3,"Well, what did you expect?","The whole movie felt a little disjointed to me.Here's what you get:* Socializing/interacting between the two chars* full on sex, uncensored and quite real* a concert songBundle those up 9 times and that's all the movie is. It's a little boring. The sex wasn't made to take over the movie, but it was only as well integrated as any other part of the movie."
3,Great Music and a not so great ending,I loved the music more the movie itself. The ending left me hanging... is it becuase I was more tuned into the music itself than the movie? Maybe...The extras has the full versions of the songs played on the movie plus a couple more.
1,Boring,Well if this movie had a story then I must have missed it because there is none no matter how you look at it. they don't even fully play the 9 songs and the sex scenes are pornographic that's true but it would have made sense if they were within some kind of context and no there is nothing shocking (as one of the reviewer declared) about 2 people having sex.I don't recommend it.
1,Boredom in the Flesh,For no apparent reason but proximity these two young people gettheir clothes off and engage in sex day and night until it's time for them to go their separate ways and let the viewer gohis. They both look good naked but that and the for-real sex both pall after a while.
4,Concise overview of the importance of the constitution and how it relates to the Mormon religion.,"Whether you are a Mormon or not, this book has some interesting insights into the importance of the Constitution. Read it with an open mind and you'll definitely learn something."
3,"Decent, but not as good as the bodyshapers","I still wear these tights, and I've had them for a few months. However, the elastic has sprung in the tush, and I know it's not because they're too small. I find Assets' quality to be as good, if not better, while their price is half. I'll just be sticking with Assets from now on (for tights, not bodyshaping panties or whatever the hell the nude bike shorts are called.)"
4,Looked good but smelled awful.,"The tights were good looking in terms of opaqueness, comfort and body control, but had a horrible mildew musty smell that required 2 washes to remove. I have had these tights before and never had this issue."
5,These are the best,"I have tried many brands and own many pairs, but nothing is as comfortable and durable as these. I love them!!!"
4,love spanx,I always love my spanx. I just wish they weren't so darn expensive. I will continue to buy them though.
4,"Spanx are Durable, But Expensive","I am a recent purchaser of the Spanx Tight End Matte Tights and have been extremely satisfied. Have found no problem with the quality -- they wear well and provide the shaping I desire. My only complaint is that the price seems pretty high for a product of this type. I used to buy Haines Opaque Shapers, but those are no longer offered. I think the Spanx are better than the Haines product."
3,Not Worth the Money,Basically just control pantyhose. I bought total control pantyhose at Target for less than half the price that are just as good. I wouldn't pay for these again.
4,Who doesn't Love Spanx,"Don't wear anything bur spanx tights in the winter. Love the fit & colors. Howver, I could have bought these cheaper in Bare Necessties with my coupon."
1,Returns,"I wanted a brown color to wear with brown boots but the bittersweet color is very very dark and couldn't really pass for brown. The waist band rolls down to the hips when I bend over or sit down, very uncomfortable and unflattering. These will be returned."
3,Well written regurgitation of known story,"This book is typical of Hoyt; very well written and nicely presented, but also unoriginal and non-innovative. Readers wanting to learn new things about Stalingrad, or even to get a detailed analysis as opposed to a mere chronicle, will find this book disappointing. So buy this book if you want a good yarn, but buy Joel Hayward's STOPPED AT STALINGRAD, Antony Beevor's STALINGRAD: FATEFUL SIEGE, John Erickson's THE ROAD TO STALINGRAD if you want substance, new findings and real analysis. Stalingrad enthusiasts are unanimous that these are the three ""standard works"" on Stalingrad. Although I give Hoyt's book three stars, I give all the other three five stars."
4,Good book,"Reading The Triumph and the Glory heightened my interest in WWII, particularly in the savage fighting on the Russian Front. Wishing to delve into the subject further, I bought a copy of Hoyt's book from Amazon and have to say it was very well done. Hoyt has written quite a number of books about WWII, all of them good. He doesn't quite go into great depth with any of his topics so his books are more for the general public than for more serious students of the war. ""199 Days: The Battle for Stalingrad"" is well worth reading, but not as definitive as Beevor's ""Stalingrad"", nor the classic ""Enemy at the Gates""."
3,A good starter on the eastern front,"If you have not read much about the eastern front, this book may be a good one to start with. If you have read several books on the subject, this book may be disappointing to you. I, being a casual reader, enjoyed it very much. It gave me a good general understanding of the war in the eastern front and more specifically, around Stalingrad. The author does not give first hand accounts of battles like Stephen Ambrose would. If you want a first hand account, read Guy Sajer's ""The Forgotten Soldier."" But Sajer's auto-biography starts with Sajer trying to get to Stalingrad. Stalingrad falls before he gets there. So if you want to read about Stalingrad, ""The Forgotten Soldier"" isn't the one for you, although it is a must read. In conclusion, if you are a casual reader, and want to know about Stalingrad, I recommend ""199 days the Battle for Stalingrad."" If you are more than a casual reader on this subject, this book will not give you anything you don't already know."
4,Good book but at times too deep.,"The book was pretty good but at times seemed over my head. Maybe I need to read through it again. But, it presents the book of matthew like never before. really cool."
4,Great book for instrumentation,"I am the proud owner for around a dozen arranging textbooks. Though this isn't my first choice, it is a nice little book, and makes for a good reference guide. I particularly like the instrumentation section of the book."
2,An incomplete score,"Regrettably this reproduction includes only the basso continuo parts. Without the other parts it is useless for anyone wishing to recreate the pieces and impossible to evaluate their merits. Two stars for effort - on what could have been a five star contribution to our knowledge of this eighteenth-century ""wundermann."""
1,Dr. Orpheus? More like Dr. Orifice,"Dr. Orpheus is nothing more than a crude, softcore porn covered in context through witty lingo, clever symbolism, and disturbing subliminal messages. Worst book I've ever read but kind of arousing."
4,A time capsule of great pulp SF,"Damon Knight digs deep and rescues an excellent selection of SF stories from the BC era (Before Campbell). While some suffer from pulpy writing, each story is bursting with flashy, grab-you-by-the-lapels-and-shake-you ideas. I also feel a lot of wry amusement reading stories with ideas that Hollywood has tried to rip off and present as their own.Great fun!"
2,"Bad, bad bootleg","This CD is a disaster in that it's a poorly recorded and badly produced bootleg of some of Basie's greatest music, deserving of being in everyone's collection (except for the absolutely pitiful sound). Submarine Records should be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the market at any amount of money."
2,Save your money,"I bought this item two years ago specifically for my then-5yr-old daughter. She wanted a drum set, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on one. My daughter enjoyed pounding on the drums, but the drums are not of great quality and the electronic crash of a cymbal or thump of a drum pad is hardly heard above the din of a wooden drumstick against hard plastic. The unit is top-heavy and can easily be bumped and fall over. The footpad is essentially useless. In sum, I should have either paid more money to get a nice Yamaha electronic drumset, or a real drumset, or just forestalled the decision entirely. After I couldn't take the rukkus of my kids pounding (not playing) with the thing, I hauled it up to the attic and there it's been ever since. Interestingly, my kids never asked for it again."
4,It's ok,"My 6.5 month old loves to play in the water. great toy for him. it doesn't float that good though, but for him it's good."
4,Licensing Parents,"Good book, i wish there were more like it out there. a very true and interesting subject."
1,Think it Through!,"If you think the drug war is putting a lot of people in jail, imagine the ovum war!And imagine how this would be enforced. Automatic reversible sterilization for all citizens which is reversed upon grant of license? At what cost? What penalties? What cost for enforcement? What effect on the birth rate? Will there be ovum tourism, where people go overseas to have a baby? Will the state take the babies away? Where will they all be taken? He says there are plenty of parents that want to adopt, and that social agencies will have time to handle the licensing and so forth because there will be so much less crime and poverty. Dream on!And then there's the Constitution. How do you get around that?By the way, his book was written in 1994. At first, I thought it was a joke, like A Modest Proposal was so long ago, but no!Disclosure: I read his paper, but not the book. That was enough!"
1,Did anyone proofread this book??,"I was enjoying this book for the first sixty-seventy pages until I read Mr. Lengel's description of Ft. Ticonderoga. He places the Fort on the Hudson River. (????) Ft. Ticonderoga, so important a location in the French/Indian and Revolutionary wars is, in fact, on Lake Champlain. Mr. Lengel also incorrectly writes that Henry Knox, after retrieving the cannons from Ft. Ticonderoga takes them down the Hudson. This too is incorrect. Knox and his men took the cannons across land to Lake George (which was frozen in winter), down to Lake George village and south to Albany before turning east to Boston. I'm totally shocked that no review of this book mentions these inaccurate statements. Anyway, after about 100 pages I took the book back to the library. I couldn't depend on the rest of his facts-so what's the point of reading it?"
4,Well done,"I thought this was a well written and informative book. Sometimes we try to portray Washington as a God, but not in this book. Edward G. Lengel gives an unbiased fair view of Washington's military life. Sometimes I believe he was overly critical, but then, I am not a military historian. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the American Revolution."
