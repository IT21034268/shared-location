5,Beautiful Book,"This is a wonderful book for not only the people of the northern states, but anyone interested in sharing the beauty and knowledge of the wilderness in winter. Good for classroom teachers and all children."
2,Poor discription,"Don't get me wrong, it is beautiful. Unfortunately, I was looking for a tea pot that my wife could use to make tea. When it showed up, it had a label that said ""not for drinking purpose."" It should have said that in the listing. I have checked many of these that were listed as not for drinking. This did not and yet it did list that it was solid brass. I thought brass was good for potable liquids. It is too small to be practical as a steamer. It is also made in China."
5,Great Product,This was purchased to be used on our fireplace insert and it is working well. We are very pleased with this Tea Pot
2,Teapot not recommended,Very small unit. Much smaller than led to believe. I would not buy it agin nor would I recommend this product. It's the size of a child's teapot.
2,Printing Problem after 1 year,"I bought this printer a little over a year ago (1 year warranty!), and it worked fine until recently. Now I am getting a gray backgound on my print-outs. E-mailing tech support, I hwas given cleaning steps, which I performed with no result. They then suggested replacing the toner, and if that didn't work, replacing the drum. I did try another toner, again with no effect. Before replacing the drum, I asked why that should be necessary when I had only used one 3,000 page toner and maybe half of a 6,000 page toner and the drum is suppose to last 20,000 pages. Their response was that the drum could only last 8,000 pages! Well, I did replace the drum...and it did no good also..."
2,Falls short of your expectations,"This series is over rated. For the price I expected more than it delivered. We own a real estate office, have 5-6 laser printers ... Was looking for dependable individual printer. Found this one to constantly jam, when you have to hand fed the printer. Only prints envelopes one at a time, and invariably jams on the 4th or 5th envelope. May be good for someone who justs prints simple letters."
2,Toner smearing and bad service,"The 1450 I purchased seems sturdy enough and basicly works well except for the print quality. The background of the printed page is smeared with excess toner! Forget about calling tech support! I had to carry on a conversation via e-mail and it would take up to a week for each reply. After all this nonsense I was basicly told to replace the toner cartridge, and if that didn't work, replace the drum unit. All this, of course, was to be at my own expense! Brother only warrenties these items for 90 days. If you get one of these printers be sure to pound the snot out of it or you may have a warrenty problem when you discover a defective toner cartridge.I should have gotten the Lexmark!"
2,A Very Disappointed small business owner,Worked well for one year. Then it started to jam several times a day. Brother support responded quickly but their suggestions didn't help. Then told me to get it serviced..certainly not worth the cost these days. Would not recommend this printer.
3,Don't buy for use with XP,"To install with Windows XP, you have to download a driver from the Brother site. It is very difficult to install the printer, and it doesn't work very well. Support is weak."
5,Teaching Middle School Math,"Teaching is difficult enough and when I was reviewing books for a research paper I came to this one from the College library. I now have it full of post-it-notes saying I want to try this one, and this one, etc. So I figured I should buy the book myself since I want to try about half the activities, materials, or problems next year with my classes. I also want to share it with my co-workers, but it was close to midnight and I had to wait."
3,Still Waiting,"Our order arrived damaged (a broken bottle of liquid minerals).It was returned, with a request for replacement.Apparently, the product is out of stock (since August 24 +/-).Still waiting."
4,Great Multi,"This is one of the best liquid multi-vitamins I have been able to find. It has more Vitamin C than most and absorbs really well. Surprisingly, my daughter loves the mango flavor so she has been using it also and it has really worked well for us. The only negative on this is most online retailers seem to be out of stock a lot on this item. There are only a few retail stores that carry it and they price it significantly higher than the online prices."
5,Love this liquid multi!,"Such a great value at such an amazing price! I am buying two!! Plus it is a full 30 servings, it's only 16 oz but the daily amount is only 1 tablespoon. Real high quality too, very dense, not watery. I even like the taste!"
5,Someone you can relate to,"What a great book! Any adoptive mom (or bio mom, for that matter) can relate to Jeanne Marie Laskas as she chronicles daily life - the fun, the nonsense, and the intense emotions - of being a mom to 2 daughters born in China. This book had me laughing out loud sometimes (really!) and shedding tears at others. I recommend this book to moms everywhere!"
1,"Entitled, angry author","I'm shocked that a publisher would publish this book. The way the author writes about the Chinese is horrifying--calling them monsters, accusing them of terrible things. The reason for her anger is unclear--it seems she blames the entire Chinese population for the fact that her little girls are available for adoption.Laskas' second daughter is a bit quiet and withdrawn at first--and Laskas seems to consider rejecting the child! And yet she dares to criticize the girl's birthmother! Unbelievable.This book is the work of a very angry, entitled person. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Coaxial Staple,"This item is labeled as Coaxial Staple which leads one to believe that it could be used for standard coaxial cable (quad or R6) such as for TV. I don't know what cable it is supposed to be for, but it's too small for coaxial cable. It is big enough for phone cord or maybe speaker wire."
5,Fantastic,"This is probably the best DVD Bruce has put out to date. I'd still love to see a few different songs performed live, but every fan wants something different. Three very different concerts and the documentary make for some interesting viewing (and listening), especially if you're into more than just recreational listening."
3,Not what I expected,"I expected to get this splitter and have it take the original 4 pairs of wires and have it generate 16 pairs using a mcroprocessor--sort of like what is used for satilite signal splitters. What this does is seperate the 4 pairs of wires (typically seen in cat5 cables) and send 1 pair to each of the ports on the side. I needed a port replicator, so I opened the box, cut some individual wires from some spare cat5 cable, and soldered my own connections so that each of the side ports is an exact duplicate of the original port, except now I have 4 instead of 1--essentially a ""dumb"" hub. It works great now and exactly what I wanted."
4,Good design but a bit shallow,"I really like this piece. The one gripe that I have is that the design is a bit too shallow for older televisions. There is only 18"" of depth for your television, make that 17 3/4"" when you use the lower latch on the door. I had to do some quick cutting on the rear plywood boards so that the backside of my television could sit inside with the doors closed. Other that that issue, the design is very simple with a nice rustic finish. There is plenty of space for media storage in the lower cabinets and it is small enough not to overpower the living room."
4,Delicious Froth,"I love Perry Mason books. Mason is a little bit fast and a little bit dangerous and always on the edge of making a risque and witty joke that the slightly cynical Della Street would be sure to get-- even though the clients he defends wouldn't. The Case of the Drowning Duck has all the elements that make Gardner books great. Even if it's not exceptional, it surely is enjoyable."
1,Hunting Camo blind material,"The product was not as advertised. It is way to ""see through"". The whole point in setting up a blind, is to be blind. You can see right through the netting and any movement within. Do not waste your time buying this product. Buyer beware."
4,A Good Translation,"With the old comedy of Greece (i.e. Aristophanes), a more common language was used, therefore, a common dialect should be used for the translation. Roche does that here, much like any of the other translations. This should not direct one away from the text. It is very readable, and brings out the great humor of these works. It is also the one of the only ways to get all of Aristophanes' extant plays in one collection, and for a good price. Very worthy of your bookshelf."
2,"Decent Modernization, Horrible Translation","This translation of Aristophanes takes many liberties with the Greek. The translator has a knack for adding profanity wherever he sees fit. This gets in the way of the humor, and makes Aristophanes' admittedly crude humor much cruder than necessary. Furthermore, there are random lines that the translator adds, including one in The Suits that seems as if he is just trying to slip in his own political views among those of the poets. Significant lines have also been removed or altered beyond recognition. Though this translator does make an honest attempt at modernizing the puns and jokes used in the play, he fails utterly at maintaining the original meaning and vibe of the poetry.In a nutshell, there are much better translations of Aristophanes out there."
2,Local Dialect Detracts from the Plays,"Paul Roche, attempting to give his plays a more ""familiar"" feel to an English-speaking audience goes too far.He has the irritating habit of occasionally flavoring the words of a minor character in such a way that they sound more like an English country bumpkin than the character they are supposed to represent.As an example, near the beginning of The Acharnians, Roche does the following; pay close attention to the Crier:AMPHITHEUS: Have the speeches begun?CRIER: 'oo wishes to speak?AMPHITHEUS: I do.CRIER: 'oo are you?AMPHITHEUS: AmphitheusCRIER: That don't sound like a 'uman being.This is but a single example. If you prefer a feeling of authenticity in your ancient Greek drama, stay away from Paul Roche."
4,Unmasking Male Depression,"I ordered this book, because I am married to someone who struggles with depression. I found this book to be very informative, as the symptoms and underlying causes of male depression are very different from women who struggle with depression. I haven't yet finished the book, but have been very happy so far with the purchase."
3,Evangelical,"Dr. Hart is an Evangelical minister, he says so in the forward, there are entire sections of the book you can skip if you are not Christian (Depressed males in the bible, and was Jesus emotional), but there's better information than in ""I don't want to talk about it"". There's real tratment options and sypmtomology, things your doctor should be looking for. It doesn't quite make suggestions for what questions you should ask your therapist, or psychiatrist, (Depression Fallout DOES do that though!)Now it was published in 2001, there are new Anti-depresseants out now that aren't mentioned, new treatments that weren't being used yet when it was initially published. It'd be great if Dr. Hart could update it and republish it without the religious claptrap, or do two versions, one for the Xian male and the one that is strictly clinical."
4,Perfect Explanation,"I was amazed at how informative this book was. I suspected my husband of being depressed, but I wasn't sure. After reading this, I was certain and was able to make a case for my husband so he would get help; he had almost every symptom listed. I may even get him to an anti-deppresant, which he adamtely refuses to even discuss. After just 3 weeks of counseling I can see a difference. He still snaps at me and verbally takes his frustrations out on me, but he now recognizes this and apologizes. Also, I'm not reacting to it and let it slide off my back, now that I know it's not directed at me. I recomend this book to anyone who has a husband who's personality has changed for the worse."
4,Advise Helpful,"This book is very helpful in understanding depression from a male point of view. The last chapter explains how those around a depressed man can be supportive and understanding towards him. These ideas, I know from experience, do wonders and can really turn a situation around! A problem that I do have with this book is that it is written from a religious, church oriented viewpoint, and that can be a turn off. The author gives the reader a feeling of cramming his spiritual viewpoints down the reader's throat, and if the reader isn't of this perspective, it can be a problem. However, the book, in general, does provide a lot of helpful advise that really does work and can very much help a loved one understand the inner perspectives of a depressed man and how to be supportive in that crucial time."
5,NOT STICKY SUNSCREEN...BEST EVER...,"I searched alittle obsessivly to find a sunscreen that wasnt sticky. I dont like that sticky feeling where everything sticks to your kids...sand and such...this is the best sunscreen. It smells great and literally 1 minute after you put it on your kids, you cant even feel it. It's powder dry and I use it on myself as well."
1,"Rubs off, expired","first off, i think banana boat has stopped this product, so these are all leftovers and are very close to expiration date. It dries pretty fast, but comes off right away... Doesn't work for me"
5,Simply Beautiful,"I sometimes think the world of days past was better than the rat race we now live in, after reading this book, I think it is proven, wounderful illustrations, and a well written text, if the reader wants to relive the days of a past life then this is the book for you"
4,easy to skim,"What i like about the book is that there are multiple pictures on each page. Granted it makes for smaller pictures than the other wildflowers of michigan books, but it makes it so much easier to glance through the book and find a flower quicker. The other book you have to turn page after page, but this one is like looking at six pages on one. I very convenient factor in my opinion."
5,Great sign!! Mets Fans Beware,This sign is well made. Have it posted outside and through all the humidity we have had it has held up very well. Any Yankee fan will want to have this sign. Great purchase
4,Nice sign,The sign is plastic so it's not super high quality but it looked pretty good for the price. Shipped on time so no problems there. Thanks.
3,"Good fashion, but too light","It's a good hat. Looks great and gets a lot of compliments. However, in breeze, there is not enough mass in the hat. The visor flies around, up, making you look like colonial, or down, blinding you. These problems are compounded when the hat gets wet (I took it on a sailing trip).Ultimately, I'm looking for something exactly like this with a bit more heft, and a wire in the brim so that it's easier shaped. This hat is just a halfway imitation."
2,Not that great,Was way too large and the side flaps awkwardly button way too low on the main part of the hat.
4,pretty dam close,"I bought a hat, long ago, when I was in Australia. After innumerable washings over time, it finally wore out and I had been looking for its replacement for years. This one is great (in the world of hybrids). The brim looks the same as the old, but is less flexible and lacking tooth, thus a propensity to crease where the old one would merely curve, when snapped up. I don't regret having bought the hat, after all said and done, however."
1,Worst hat ever...,"Packed too folded up, can't make it to look right! Order a medium but it feels like a large. This hat is worth $5 in my book not $15. Save your money and get a better quality hat. I'm still looking for one...."
4,Survived Africa!,This hat was AWESOME!!! It protected my face and neck from the sun. (I am an extremely pale person and came back after 3 weeks there with no sunburn!!) The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was cause when it was windy the brim kept flying back. I wished it had a stiffer brim like a baseball hat but otherwise it was great!!
2,Packaging,"Would've been a great hat if it wasn't packaged so folded up. It was so wrinkled and bent I can't get it to look right, even with ironing and tyring everthing else."
2,Flimsy,"Very light cotton, brim blows in the wind, shrunk at least 30% in first wash. Very disposable."
3,Good sun protection... but floppy!,"Nice hat, very easy to pack away, washes well, too. I wear it to the beach where I don't mind if it gets wet, dirty, etc., since it is easy to clean. If it's even moderately breezy, however, you need the cord to keep it on; and even then, the hat will flop around quite a bit. No structure and not heavy duty by any means, but convenient -- fits in any pack or even pants or shorts pocket."
3,To flimsy,Brim of the hat is to flimsy no way to make it hold its shape. Wore this hat at the beach couldn't keep it from flapping in the winds. Quality materials just needed to be more sturdy.
5,Great hat.,This hat has been great for keeping rain and sun off of my folically challenged (bald) head. The BIG PLUS is that they are available in many sizes - including large ones.
2,Large was bigger than expected and thin material,"I am not impressed by the hat. The fabric is thin. I typically soak the hat first and wash prior to first use. After the wash, the hat is wrinkled and the shape of the hat droops pretty badly. I chose large size when I typically order a 7 1/2 hat size. The hat is still a bit large."
5,Fantastic 7 disc set,"The Janacek Quartet seems most remembered for its recording of Leos Janacek's two string quartets. This set, somewhat hard to come by, will likely elevate their reputation for those who hear it. Three and a half discs are dedicated to Czech works (mostly Dvorak, but also Smetana and Janacek).The Janacek Qt. plays with the lyricism and athletic technique one expects from Czech groups, but avoids going over the top or heavy handedness. The Dvorak performances especially attention-grabbing. Also included are 4 Haydn quartets and a work each by Mozart, Mendelssohn and Beethoven. The Mendelssohn Octet (performed with the Smetana quartet) is absolutely top shelf, as are most of the other performances. Get one now; who knows how easily it will be located once its gone. Their disc of both Janacek quartets is still available on Supraphon."
5,Christmas Gift!,"Having been born and raised in the South, this book brought home memories of my own Christmases in the South. I could assign my own family member's names to his female family! I have to read this book every Christmas or something is missing from my celebration!"
3,InDesign CS2,"No one for books and more of a hands on learner. I used the book for reference but you can really figure out the software yourself if you were a previous QuarkXpress, Photoshop, Illlustrator user."
1,What about CS3?,"I'm only giving it 1 star because CS3 has now been released, so the book is of modest value except for those who wish not to take advantage of the new and improved. Try taking this one to a used book store and you'll see that at ""1"" it's over-rated.Aside from that, this is an excellent series of manuals, particular valuable as software publishers no longer include manuals! As they say at O'Reilly: ""The book that should have been in the box."""
3,Good book but not a reference book,"I bought this book and yes, it is a good book but it is not the reference book that I was looking for. I need to be able to look up how to do a particular application or what a certain button does. I have to figure out which lesson this might be found in and then go through to the lesson. This is time consuming and I do not always find the information I need. I am really looking for a great index with step by step on how to perform certain funtions."
4,excellent product for the price,"I used to have a larger powered board and wanted a smaller board for my EQ/tuner and wireless transmitter. This pedalboard is well made and sturdy and suits my requirements. 9v power outlets are always a plus and this board has plenty. The padded carry case is well made and has a large zippered pocket to carry extra cords and whatnot, plus a shoulder strap."
3,"Not as pictured, but acceptable","Received the board and case on time, with all pieces intact. I agree with the other reviewer that it would be a better package (more convenient and worth slightly more) if there 6"" audio cables were included. Nevertheless, the board is simple and funcional.I'd give it a 4 star rating, but what I received is not the same as what's pictured on the website. The board itself appears to be the same item but the case is different (NO zippered pocked on the outside). Amateur musicians know how important a convenience like that is. I would have bought this item anyways, but it's mildly disappointing to receive something different than expected."
3,Gospel and Early Pop,"This collection contains a lot of the gospel recordings that Cooke recorded as a member of the Soul Stirrers. Also a few of his early pop-recordings like ""You Send Me"", ""I'll Come Running Back to You"" and ""Loveable"" are found. All these songs are fine in their own rights, but for me the CD doesn't have much of the real interesting and influential Cooke, who would later be known as the father of soul.Moreover, as a far as I can see, all songs are available on other more attractive CD-collections, with informative liner notes, oictures etc. None of this is available her."
5,Great product that reduces airborn dust,This is a great product that worked exactly as described. Was very easy to install and cut the slot by slowly raising the blade. I find that much less sawdust flies in my face because the slot is the exact width of the blade. Most of the dust goes into the base where the vacuum hose pulls it away.
3,Charm and Good Cooking,"What a charming peek into year round Southern living. This read, peppered with photos, is an entertaining combination cookbook, story book, and history of growing up in the South. Whatever the season or occasion, you'll find a recipe to try.If you are a collector of cookbooks, this is definately one to add to your collection!Brenda Nixon, author of Parenting Power in the Early Years and The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the Start"
4,"Not a Cook Book Fan, but Love this Book","I am not a fan of cook books. But I was attracted to this one cause it had a definite southern theme. This is much more than just a cook book. It's got cute little antecdotes about southern living. As a former Tallahasseean I found this to be a very entertaining read. And the cover art is just outstanding.Giving this 4 stars only because I'm not an expert on cooking, so I can't really judge the recipes. But they sound delicious.Eric Dondero, Author, Worldwide Multilingual Phrase BookHouston, Texas"
4,Wonderful reference book,"Culinary Kudzu has it all - recipes, great stories about growing up in the Delta, and tips to ease your time entertaining and in the kitchen."
5,A Wonderful Find,"Culinary Kudzu is a wonderful glimpse into southern life. Depriest Reed really captures ""growing up southern"" in this charming recollection of stories and recipes. In addition to the wonderful recipes, Culinary Kudzu provides the reader with inventive tips for entertaining and weaves these all together with personal rememberances. This book truly is a great find."
2,not as pictured,"Pay attention when the description says it is ""distressed"" wood. While in the photo the cabinet looks solid black, in fact it looks like a used and abused piece of old furniture. As another reviewer noted, there are vertical yellow-ish stripes on it which are either bare wood or carelessly applied paint. On the plus side, it appears to be solidly constructed, arrives fully assembled, and will serve its purpose. I thought about ordering two but am glad I just bought one."
4,Looks beautiful,Great bang for the buck! Beautiful design and the faded antique look is eye catching. Shipping was slow though but other than that no complains
4,Small but nice,It only holds about 25 dvds or so... but cute! I set a fun candle lamp on top. The review I saw was correct that it looks alot more than I paid. It is antique or a rubbed finish. Not solid black like the pic. I like it more though than I expected! Better as a end table or to put decoration on.
1,Not as described,"This item was not as described in the listing. It is not a DVD cabinet, it is a small cabinet with one shelf. Can maybe hold 15 DVDs. I expected it to have DVD compartments up the length of the tall cabinet, not one shelf in the middle. Also, it is not all brown as the picture indicates. It has yellowish ""rustic"" looking lines going up the cabinet vertically. This did not fit with my furniture. If that is what you are looking for, then it is an ok cabinet. It is cheaply made, but then again it is very inexpensive. Also, if you buy it and want to return it, the seller will make you pay shipping. So don't buy it hoping it fits in with your furniture. Make sure it is something that you want or eat the $30."
1,what a mess!,"color is great and true to picture, but this scarf leaves little pink tuffs everywhere!"
5,DYNOMITE,"SIMPLY OUTTA this SPACE & SPAN of tyme.i couldn't wait till i got it to hear this lady and i wasn't disappointed.The disc was Clean & played superbly without a scratch. It didn't take longeither to get to me, once funds were recieved.I respected that from the seller also."
3,I feel just a little cheated.,"When we buy gloves, it's expected that we are purchasing a PAIR of gloves unless it is clearly noted otherwise. The write up for this says ""set of 2"" and to me that means a ""set of 2 pairs of gloves"". In fact I did get 2 gloves, one left and one right, that is one pair. I consider this to be a bit of deceptive advertising."
2,Item title misleading..!!!,"The item title says, ""Condiment Jars and Rack Polycarbonate Jar With Lid"". This led me to believe that I was getting the whole rack. This is not so - all that arrived was one plastic jar - no rack, no other jars. Not very useful..."
4,"Moderate-Paced Action, But Still a Good Read!","This isn't an action-packed story but it is well-written, I loved the characters, and it is very scenic. The whole book focuses on a journey for this group of people ranging from young teens to an old, crusty farmer. There's a prophecy that has to do with this group and they encounter help in unexpected places along the way (as one person foretells) and there is a lot of adventure going on. I enjoyed reading it, didn't have to skip through ""boring"" parts to get to any action fight scenes because the whole story just seems well-balanced. I found this book at a used book store (good place to find something new and different) and I'm planning to get the next in the series off Amazon."
2,"Promising, but a no-go","I really need to stop being taken in by the pretty covers before I buy an entire series. The cover is about all this book has going for it. Didn't even make it half way thru the book, much less on to the 3 of the series and the following trilogy. This book has a lot of detail that I like, but the constant jumping POV just destroys any sympathy or understanding you build for the characters. It comes unannounced and sometimes after just a sentence or 2, sometimes after a couple of pages. The author put a lot of work into building his world, but really had no idea what to do with the population. Maybe the next series, but unless I read some really good reviews, I won't be reading anymore of his books."
1,Really Boring,"I agree with the reviewers who said the pace was too slow. It took me forever to finish because I kept putting it down and doing something else. A book this long needs more than one task that the characters have to complete. Following after kidnappers for hundreds of pages - boring, boring, boring. I wanted to see how it ended, so I skipped here and there for the last 200 or so pages. It wasn't worth the time it took to read it. A much better choice is Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series. Those are books I have a hard time putting down."
1,Are we there yet?,"When I was younger and naive I had a rule that I would always finish any book I started no matter how bad the book. Now that I am older and hopefully wiser I have decided that life is too short to waste finishing a book you don't enjoy. This is one of those books. OMG is this book boring. Let me summarize the book for you. ""Today we got up and headed east. We saw trees, mountains and rivers. We camped outside. It snowed."" Now repeat that for 600 pages. If you are in to detailed descriptions of mythical scenery then this is the book for you. The characters are uni-dimensional and unsympathetic. There is nothing new, original or innovative in this story. It is a thoroughly average fantasy quest novel. I finished two other books while struggling to get through page 299 of this sleeper. I give up. Life is too short and there are too many good books to read. Needless to say I'm going to pass on the next two installments in this series."
2,"Good ideas, just not executed well","While the story is the typical 'group of wanna-be heroes goes on a quest to save the world' the author has built a very believable world (seemingly set in Europe in the far future? <shrug>) and I really wanted to become immersed in it. The problem is that he cannot tell a compelling story! I felt no connection to any of the characters and the action sequences were laid out almost matter-of-factly. And it's too bad because the setting is remarkable and deserves to be inhabited by people to match it. The story never grabbed me and while it can be argued that the book is setting the stage for the next two the plot isn't all that complex and needs dynamic story telling to bring the whole thing off. 2 stars for the world and history, I won't be reading the other books of the trilogy."
2,watching paint dry,"it's pretty dull stuff. two books and 1200 pages later, i still don't care a lick about any of the characters. plot twists are by them endlessly being taken captive by some group and getting free again someway. it got to the point where i said ""if they are taken captive one more time in this book, i'm done."" they were, so i am."
2,Enough is Enough,"I tried to like this book. I wanted to like this book. I just can't like this book, nor can I finish it. I have reached about 300 pages so far and I have just thrown in the towel today. I can reiterate what a previous reviewer wrote about this book: Woke up, walk, walk, walk, freezing, snow, mountains, a paragraph to describe a stream, camp for the night, wake up, repeat for another 100 pages.One word - BORINGThe only reason I gave it two stars is the author does have writing talent and paints detailed, descriptive pictures of the scenery. Now If I was reading an atlas, this would be superb, but I'm not .. enough said.Skip it"
1,Fabulous Cover Art,"The books of this series have the most breathtaking cover art. The simple but stunning image was a big factor in my decision to buy this book. Alas, do not judge a book by its cover!The author has a couple of decent characters but he seems unable to focus on them. His pacing is leaden. He spends pages describing the landscape in passive, adjective-laden prose. Unable to move his plot along dramatically, the author focuses on small details of setting until I felt I was reading a travelogue. Worst of all, some of his details about horses and winter travel were wrong. Had I been swept up in an action fantasy worthy of Tolkien, I wouldn't have noticed. This is a book that cries out for editing.Unlike sleeping pills, this book has no side effects as it sends you to sleep. In that sense, I can recommend it."
3,A Quick and Easy View of An Amazing Woman,"Picked this book up at a used bookstore well off the beaten path and had finished it in 48 hours. Its author does not belittle her audience, but also focuses on making the fairly complex world of theatre readable for anyone with an interest. Thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. A great book to read on the train or in rehearsal downtime. Not the most complex book in the world, but definitely worth the read."
5,GRIT DISK,"The hook and loop is the only way to go. Easy on and easy off, when installing on the grinder. The 7"" size means longer use and more sanding accomplished. This disk will not fall apart."
5,AZ Reader,"Author Gilb brings to the reading public a marvelous work of short stories depicting life in his culture with an indepth knowledge of human behavior. He peers deep into emotion, love, and the commonality of ordinary life with wisdom and honesty and displays his keen artistic ability touching the pulse of human mankind. He equates his vast abilities using bits and pieces and brushes for all of us via the pen, stories that touch life's precious moments. This evening Author Gilb I was privileged to view your interview on national television. May I offer my congratulations to you as a fellow American, on your outstanding contribution to the literary world. You build your stories with great ability. Wish you much success and I'm looking forward to your novel, which I believe you indicated is under construction."
5,Neurology made accessable for the pediatrician,"Straight forward yet complete, it covers the most trivial and common problems of pediatric neurology as seen in routine pediatric care. Clear explanatory diagrams and flow-charts for easy decision-making. A must-have for the pediatrician and pediatric resident."
4,Poignant!,"If you are familiar with Fairouz's music, this album was a bit of a disappointment and a surprise as well. Stripped off her signature styles, Fairouz's Wala Kif sounds like an aged Arabic version of Norah Jones on valuum! The album mostly sung in Lebanese slang delivers an honest, tired and drained Fairouz who's lovestruck and sick at the same time. Dramatic and livid with a full bodied musical sound Wala Kif has made a landmark for Fairouz's musical career. Perfect for a sunny,rainy or snowy day, Fairouz here puts you in a chilled out mood, leaving you pondering about life's mysteries accompanied with the Armenian orchestra's 2 cents in this album is a keeper. I just can't believe how many times I've played this album. My favorite tracks are Sabah oo Massa, Sobhil Jeez, Ana Faz'aneh and Bizzakar bil Khareef."
5,helpful,i got this book before i got my french bulldog and i felt very prepared and informed after reading the book. Once i got my puppy i was ready to make the right decisions
3,Has most of the basics,"The book goes into detail about the history of the Frenchies and puppyhood. Nothing that you couldn't get off the Internet, though. Still, great to have a hard copy around."
2,Eh.,"Not very insightful. Should be labeled ""Dogs for dummies"". Didn't really provide me with any knowledge I didn't already obtain from looking on the internet for about 30 mins."
4,Support non-existence,"The product is brilliant. The installation was smooth. However, the instruction manual covers primarily fax functions only. There is effectively no part for the printer. The scanner function is also poorly covered. The software suite is not explained anywhere. I sent an e-mail to Brother asking a couple of questions. There was no answer for two days. So I sent another to their support. I have not heard any, even confirmation, for a week. Due to their no response, I ended up buying an unnecessary thing. Again the product is great and I will recommend to anyone. But if you need help. You have to take care of yourself. Brother does not seem to have any intention to help their customers."
1,Do not buy untill the software is updated,I cannot scan. I called technical support and I was told that I need to reinstall window XP professional. The problem was not fixed. I am still under warranty and I do not knwo if brother will take the machine back. I can see from the other reviews that I am not the only one with software problem.
1,Mac users beware!,"Mac users, as of 10/11/02, this product doesn't really work with OS 10.2.1. You may be able to print if you're lucky, but the scanner and the manual feed aren't supported according to the Brother website (a page that's impossible to find). The worst part of my experienec so far is Brother's technical support for the Mac. If you try to reach them by phone, they'll actually ask you to FAX your question to their Mac expert who can ONLY be contacted by written fax (no email address, no telephone number). Just a customer service nightmare. I wish I could return this, but I'm stuck now. Get the HP multifunction instead."
3,Mac Users: Good bang for the $ but,"not the best printer. Using the 8500 with an ibook and OS 9 and find that its great to have a fax, copier, scanner and laser printer in the same package. Print is decent but took a while for the toner to even out. I suspect HP has a better system. OS 9 driver is ok. Can stack >50 pgs for scanning. Scanner is fast but software is unacceptably slow. Tried Omnipage pro X but it doesn't readily recognize the 8500. Photoshop is fast if saving as images. A great stand alone fax/copier. Most other buttons don't work with mac. Biggest limitation is the quality of the oem software and manual. Tech support is easier to access and better than many other venders. Overall- satisfied."
2,Real problems with XP,"As reported by other reviewers, my 8500 worked well with Windows 98, but I've had nothing but problems making it work using a new computer with Windows XP. Most of the time neither the native printer driver on the installation CD nor the one downloaded from the Brother web site work. I never got the inbox XP driver to work. After numerous installation attempts, I gave up and am using an older, but much more reliable Canon inkjet. Unless Brother gets a trouble-free set of XP drivers out to users, they shouldn't advertise this product as XP-compatible."
5,Pretty reliable printer. Owned four for many years.,"Pretty reliable printer. Very helpful for sheetfed scanner. 2nd paper tray available still some places so you can use it with two different forms loaded in the trays plus the manual feeder. I have had four of these running reliably for around five years. Toner and drums are dirt cheap too. Use these all day for scanning documents, printing letters, stamps dot com postage, faxing, etc. Occasional error messages can be deciphered and/or cleared with info available by searching the web. Definitely rated 5/5 at my office."
5,like the energizer bunny!,"I have had the Brother MFC 8500 forever. I use it constantly for printing, often for faxing, and occasionally for scanning and copying. It has been awesome. I was online searching how to send faxes since I just switched to Vonage and the answer was a quick little switch in the settings to overseas mode and now it is perfect. I am amazed at how much I print and how little I have to change the toner (about every 2 years!) I honestly have loved and bragged about this machine for years (since 2002 I think). I don't think they sell or make this anymore and I'm sure this review is irrelavant but I saw the mixed reviews on this and I was shocked, so I had to put my 2 cents in just for the heck of it. This machine is still going strong, but when it does finally kick the bucket I will definitely be going with a similar machine from Brother and I hope I have the same great expeience with it too (just maybe with color added)."
2,No Support for 2003,"I am generally happy with the quality of printing, faxing, and copying, however scanning does not work. I run Windows Server 2003 and there simply are no drivers for it (nor, as far as I can tell, intention to create drivers)."
3,prints gray background,I bought this less than 2 years ago. All of a sudden it has started printing a light gray background on all printed pages. I am using high yield toner cartridge and it is not showing toner as being low. I tried cleaning the toner/drum components with compressed air - it doesn't help. Has anyone experienced this?
4,Good all in one product,"This is used in my husband's office. We like the all in one feature because it takes up less room and is less expensive than buying a fax, a copier, a printer, etc. It is a little bit difficult to use at first, but once you get the hang of it and get familiar with all the features, it is a breeze. We would recommend this product to others."
3,RE: No Support for 2003,"Thought I'd update everyone as I use the 8500 on Windows Server 2003. You can get it to print by downloading a patch from the brother website, and then use the HL-720 print driver, but all other functions such as scanning and such are not available. This work around is merely to print.Overall, the machine is OK for a laser printer but sub-standard for faxing etc."
5,WONDERFUL!,"A wonderful new look at a classic. Dr Who has been one of my favorite shows for a very long time (well at least since the 60's). This new Dr Who ,Matt Smith, is marvelous! The story is branching out in many different directions! I'm certainly looking forward to more!"
2,Vanilla pack only---waiting for the entire set PLUS extras!,"I'm not going to critique the episodes themselves...people have already done that. What I'm going to focus on is the release itself. True fans, this is just the ""vanilla"" pack. Notice that there are no extras, no commentaries, and it doesn't even include the 2010 Christmas special. Granted, it's dirt cheap, but you get what you pay for.I for one will wait until they release the entire set, all 14 episodes, with the Confidentials, the episode prequels, the commentaries, and all the other goodies. Frankly, if you don't get those, then why should you pay for something you could just as easily torrent?"
3,DTS Audio Only,"Warning: This Blu Ray edition only has English DTS-HD 5.1 audio, no Dolby for older systems.The find print says Dolby, but I got my 2 disc set in the mail today after pre-ordering and the actual episodes are DTS-HD audio only. The menu is in Dolby, but once the episode starts, no audio.... Bummer.....I guess I really will have to upgrade my home theater audio sooner rather than later."
5,Love It,".Interesting, good and unexpected. Lots of variety in the stories. Loved ""Let's Kill Hitler"" and ""The Wedding of River Song""."
1,Worst quality I've ever seen in a DVD.,"There is 3 hours on a DVD here, so the result is a horribly pixellated picture, which is odd, as typically the DVDs of other seasons were stellar. Why is this so bad?"
5,Doctor who : series 6,Matt Smith takes the doctor to new heights in series 6 introducing new bad guysand a old friend. An absolute must have for fans and newcomers alike!
5,Bset Dr Who Ever,I did not actually recieve this DVD I had mailed to my grandaughters in Texas. They loved it. When they were here in Virginia we watched Dr Who evry Sunday when Amazon posted the latest epesode to my account. Season 6 PT 1 was simply Brilliant to borrow our british cousins expression.
4,Matt Smith one of the Best New Doctors,I love Matt Smith as the doctor. He is quirky and fun to watch. I equate him to being a cross between Tom Baker and Patrick Troughton. I'm 64 years old and never get tired of the Doctor. Been watching his escapades for years. I love all the stories written for Matt Smith. I find River Song an exciting and intriguing new character. I too feel pangs for Rory. I read something that makes me wonder if Matt Smith is going to be replaced. Say it isn't so!!! I was hoping to buy the complete Seasons 5 and 6 as a package. Maybe they will wise up.
2,Season 6 Part 1?,"BBC series' are already short (like 10-12 episodes per season). I love the show and have been a fan for years. The spin this season has seems to be geared towards drawing in American audiences, but is still entertaining. I think Neil Gaiman's episode ""the Doctor's Wife"" is my favorite since the last Christmas episode with Michael Gambon. BUT, and it is a big BUT (no puns please), Whats the deal with breaking up the seasons in to seperate discs??? Battlestar Galactica did this half way through and I refused to buy them as well. Give us one box PER season and stop milking your fan base!! jerks!! I give it 5 stars because I like the show. This multi disc per season gets -3 stars"
4,"Early IMAX, but Thrilling","I watched this movie about 50 times when I was a counselor at Space Camp years ago and it was always my favorite of the IMAX films. While The Dream Is Alive, Blue Planet, etc. have much more IMAX footage, none of them compare with the adrenaline rush of Hail Columbia. The other space-oriented IMAX films that I have seen are much more documentary, while Hail Columbia is telling the exciting story of the first Space Shuttle launch. That storytelling aspect alone makes the difference for me and keeps me on the edge of my seat each time I watch it."
5,I will buy this DVD,"I have always been a fan of the Space Shuttle IMAX films. And after the events of Feb 2003, now is a great time to pick up this collector's DVD to appreciate the power that Columbia brought to the world."
5,MY COUSIN RACHEL,"DVD IS GREAT QUALITY AND IT HAS LOADS OF TWISTS AND TURNS ALWAYS MAKING YOU TRY TO FIGURE OUT ""WHO DUNNIT"". DID SHE OR DIDN'T SHE? VER GOOD BLACKS AND WHITE, GREAT FOR SUCH AN OLD MOVIE. A MUST HAVE FOR OLIVIA DEHAVILLAND FANS."
5,my review,i'm a fan of olivia dehaviland. she is a wonderful actress. the reason i say that is because she is still living. i'm looking forward to seeing a very young richard burton in this movie.
4,an inspiring film,"As with most of Ken Burns' projects, I really enjoyed this film. I've noticed some reviewers faulting it as incomplete in some respects, and although I'm no expert on the subject, I don't doubt that this is not the whole story. I do think the film does a good job of providing insight into the life and thinking of a truly amazing man, and I doubt whether it would be possible to capture on film all that we know about Jefferson from existing literature, even if we were talking about a multi-volume DVD set. In my opinion this film excels in its potential to help spark an interest among viewers about the man and his times. I wouldn't be surprised if this film will lead many to dig deeper, picking up a book or two and learning more. Personally, I was amazed that there is so much information included in this single DVD. Well worth the time spent viewing, more than once."
4,great personal introspective,"Very good on personal life, just a little short on personal philosophical concepts of democracy. Could tell the resolution was only VHS but pretty good for a commercial tape (much better than most purchased VHS tapes). Not encrypted, so can be recorded to DVD for long term durable use."
5,Thomas Jefferson - A film by Ken Burns,"Excellent, it has gone into my T.J. Library! Like him, My robot IS his Monicello...it will be finished, someday."
4,Thomas Jefferson - A Film by Ken Burns,I enjoyed this film very much. You can alway expect a in-depth program from Ken Burns. My only complaint is that when they got to the area of Jefferson life regarding Sally Hemings they really just skimmed the surface and really did not have the interviews or research that I thought would occur. I found it very insulting that two of the historians thought it was impossible for him to have had a relationship with a slave. After that I lost interest in anything that they said. Besides that issue the program was very good.
1,Not Worth The Money Or The Hassle,"We loved this TV when we first purchased it but... 3 years later, 2 replaced lamps, and over $300 spent for those lamps, the TV is now no longer working. In the end, not work the money or the hassle."
1,GREAT TV UNTIL YOU REPLACE LAMP,We loved the Sony KDF-46E2000 until 2 weeks ago. The projection lamp needed replacing. I purchased a new one and replaced it. Tv came on for about 10 minutes then wouldn't come back on. I had 3 blinking red lights on power button. I contacted Sony and they said the lamp door was not on right. I checked and it was. So I called a tv repair man. They came out and fixed the activor switch. 140.00. Tv then had a red band at top of screen. Contacted Sony again. They told me to take it to a certified Sony repairman. The problem is there are no Sony repairman in my area. They are 2 hours away. After arguing with Sony they finally offered me a new tv for a discounted rate. A 1599.99 tv for 768.00. But I already spend 300.00 for new bulb and repair service. The engine light is failing on the KDF-46E2000. TV is only 16 months old. Very disappointed. So don't try to change projection bulb without a repairman.
5,Sony's Grand WEGA... W-O-W!!!,"We ordered the Sony 46"" Grand WEGA from Electronic Express on Amazon. We received the TV in 3 days- the delivery service was extremely helpful- right to the TV's stand! Sony has it easy to lift off the packaging and unveil your new TV. Setup was automatic and simple. Color is beautiful and so clear. Amazon amazing deal!"
1,Poorly Edited,"Philip K. Dick was a brilliant man who, like many brilliant men, has been posthumously mishandled by editors, biographers, etc. In Pursuit of Valis, I believe, is a further example of this. The editor's introduction is poorly written and riddled with assumptions and errors. The material in the book is choppy and poorly edited. Phil Dick never intended this material to be sold, he never will see any profits on the sale of this book, so who profits from its sale? The editor? His estate? His fans? I don't know. I am sure Sutin is getting his cut. Some of us wish that he would leave Phil Dick alone. But, that aside, if you are going to publish works not written for public consumption, at least do it properly. Surely, the volume could have been edited so as to make the material easier to comprehend? And what of the sloppy printing? Fans of PKD will buy this and enjoy it as they should, because at least we get a glimpse of the man. But at what cost?"
5,Moving in the Apostolic: God's Plan to Lead His Church to the Final...,This book is amazing. It is so easy to understand. There are awesome revelations. It has been a blessing to me.
5,Moving in the Apostolic,It is true we perish from lack of knowledge. This book opened my eyes to what God really wants from us as a church. I encourage everyone to read this book so the release of the apostolic can be taught to all.
4,What is the apostolic?,"In order to know where you're going you have to know where you've been. This book paints a clear picture of the origin of the apostle. Knowing it's origin, we can clearly see what an apostle really should be. Excellent book on apostolic ministry."
4,Great Book for understanding the Apostolic,This book was very informative about the apostolic call in the church and the need for the apostle to be given rightful place in church government. It was an easy read and clear in its objective to enlighten the body of Christ.
2,Poor value for money,"Despite being a space anorak, I was disappointed. At around 35mins per DVD, it's clear they'd all fit on just one - it'd be a good deal at 1/5th the price. The packaging is basic; no further content or data on the cases. And cheap-looking DVDs...Content is fun, but only fascinating in part. About what you'd expect from a decent TV documentary. The IMAX format is lost even on my widescreen setup, and the resulting wide-angle distortion is sometimes a distraction.Tech note: I also noticed poor colour resolution - distinct colour graduations which I've not seen on other DVDs. Perhaps a coincidence, but I doubt it.Very disappointing. Sorry to be curmundgeonly."
4,IMAX films are almost always 4:3 format,"That's because IMAX theaters are that same 4:3 format. To get widescreen you'd have to either lose picture on the top and bottom, or stretch the screen out over two blocks."
3,IMAX Space Collection in standard format,"I love the IMAX films but was disappointed that these DVD's were in standard 4:3, not widescreen 16:9 or 2.35:1.Also, the audio narration is often drowned-out by the background music and is hard to hear.Otherwise, the shots and scenes are outstanding."
3,disapointing,"If you want to get a lot of brilliant space and launch shots, you won't find them here. The best parts of these movies could fit on one disc. ""Dream"" and ""Destiny"" are the better ones.It's kind of creepy watching all of this taking place onboard Challenger."
2,Way too basic,This book is for someone who has never even used a computer or Word. It is very nicely put together with lots of color photos and screen shots but I wanted to know more than how to insert clip art or justify type which is what this book covers. If you are complete novice to the PC this is the book for you.
5,LOVED IT!,"I have read the reviews after I played the game. On a few negative points I agree, but overall this game was excellent. I know a lot of reviewers had negative opinions on the plot. As in the reviews, I didn't get why her boss was so interested in finding her and bringing her back, but I did understand why she was following an old man to end of his dream, even if Kate doesn't know herself. My five year daughter even got caught up with finding the mammoths and Syberia. That should tell you something about this incredible journey. I must say finally a game with excellent graphics and a story that you can't get enough of. There sure isn't a lot of games out there you say say that about."
4,a good continuation for kate's story,"I really enjoyed the first Syberia game, so I couldn't wait to get this one out of the box. I really did enjoy the story to this game, possibly even moreso than the first one. A lot of the puzzles were well thought out, but some were almost impossibly difficult. (And I'd like to see a modern adventure game without a puzzle dealing with sound, thankyouverymuch. Or a better system to skip ahead to where you want to be without having to go through a million screens of walking.) The plot is mostly what held me, though. I liked the characters and their interaction."
5,"Very fun, but shorter than the first","This sequel was as much fun and as beautiful as Syberia I. However, some of the puzzles at the end were rediculously difficult, and the game was much shorter than Syberia I. However, I recommend it, and wish there were more games that were this interesting, fun, beautiful, and stable."
2,let down,"I thought that Syberia I was one of the best adventure games ever produced. Syberia II continues the story line and has superb graphics just like the first one. I believe more work should've been put into creating relevant, logical puzzles for the game. There were too many puzzles that required exhausting random permutations (rather than logic) to reach the solution, e.g., the fishing puzzle had 27 combinations, the 'heart' puzzle had 121 both with no apparent logic to the final solution.I'm not disappointed that I bought the game; but I was expecting a better, fully thought out experince like in Syberia I."
2,not nearly as good as the first,"the first syberia i really enjoyed, a few boring parts but in general, very nice. syberia 2 on the other hand is less than what i had expected. the main issue i have with this game is dialogue. lets face it, its terrible. for example, you talk to a girl in which she says her name is anna voralberg. when you talk to her next, your character says: ""are you anna voralberg?"" its things like this that bastardize a game. unfortunately, its like this throughout the entire thing. at one point your character is yelling and insulting a priest and right after that, youre calm and wishing him a good day. its poor planning in the dialogue department. oh, and another thing... the puzzles are weak. they seem like theyre going to be a chalenge, and its not... and other times your wondering ""why the hell did i pick this up?""."
4,Good follow up to Syberia I.,"I bought this game because I really liked playing the first Syberia. I wasn't disappointed here either. Even though this game was by a different company than the first, the characters, look and feel of the game are the same. The only thing I really didn't like about this game was some parts of it require you to do a lot of walking back and forth to get things, combine things, etc. This made the game kind of boring in spots. Otherwise, it was a lot of fun."
3,"Good graphics, but the gameplay falls apart","The first two days I played this game, it was really cool. The graphics are really great. The gameplay is good, and the puzzles were solveable if you were careful and thought about what you were doing. Then, about halfway through the game, things start to fall apart and some crucial items become nearly impossible to find. At this point, you realize that there really aren't many objects and puzzles in this game period, and that you just spend most of your time walking by endless, empty backgrounds. I don't know why they can't do a little more testing on these games or at least spend a little more time thinking of what would make good puzzles to solve."
1,You can really tell that this was self-published,"Yes, granted, I do not agree with her theological concept of the Godhead, but I have seen better pro-trinitarian arguments from oneness preachers! Not to be mean, but you can really tell that this book was self-published (not that I am putting down on self-published books, but truly this was the only way that she could have this on the shelf). She has no clear understanding of oneness thought, Greek, or even Tertullian's Latin. She butchers Magee's book and often goes on rants about things unrelated to the topic at hand. Amazing enough, she is still attending a oneness church, although she is a trinitarian. She never does once approach the topic with any scholarly sense and instead leaves you wondering if she is still on the same topic. If I was a trinitarian, I would, after reading this book, begin to consider a change in my dogma, if, after 1800 years, this is what trinitarian apology has come to. I recommend French's book: ""Our God is One"""
1,poor quality band,"I have reviewed this watch 2 other times on Amazon, but the review keeps disappearing. It must be because it was honest and not to their liking. The band on this watch started coming apart before it was a year old. I bought it last March and the band looks so bad I cannot wear it until I have it replaced. Tag Heuer provides NO WARRANTY on the bands. Buyer beware, its beautiful when you first buy it."
2,Before you consider buying this book...,"I compared this book with the Japanese verb guide I actually bought, called the Complete Japanese Verb Guide. I highly recommend that book over this one. I agree with the other reviewers here that 501 should have Japanese characters. The Complete Japanese verb guide gives the kanji for the verb as well as romanization for beginners. It's a better book all around, so I would suggest turning this one down."
2,"Fair, But Would Be Better If It Used Japanese","I originally bought the book as a resource for teaching a Japanese class. Then I returned it to the book store because it was not useful enough. I found it useful because it shows how to conjugate verbs. However, the one important thing that it is missing is ACTUAL JAPANESE CHARACTERS. Japanese can be written for foreign language learners using the Roman (or Latin) alphabet, in the way this book does. However, if you want to learn Japanese, you have to see it in Japanese characters. This book does not use any Japanese characters."
1,Is this a book for Japanese language learners?,"I bought this useless book and a similarly useless book for conjugating Korean verbs before Amazon started publishing reader reviews, so I didn't know the conjugations were romanized. Any serious learner of Japanese learns the Kana right away, so using romanized Japanese in this kind of book is silly. I could not read it."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Do not buy this book. Unlike English Japanese verbs are extremely regular and easily congugated. It is more important that you learn the rules and not very difficult, then you will be able to congugate every single verb yourself."
2,Sigh! Another Romanized Asian language book,"For serious students of Japanese, this book is useless because all the verb conjugations are done in Romanji. I am an American learning Japanese in Korea, and here students learn Hiragana from the first day of class. If this book is published in REAL Japanese, then I will buy it."
1,Badly Thought Out,"Because this author uses his own original way of transcribing Japanese into Roman characters, this book is, at times, somewhat confusing. For example, normally the hiragana character 'tsu' is written in Romaji as such. The way it is pronounced, there is a very definite combination of 't' and 's'. This book writes it as 'tu.' I fail to see how that makes it more accurate. It makes it LESS accurate. I don't know who he is aiming this book at, but the pronunciation of many of his transcriptions, in everyday spoken Japanese, would clearly be wrong.Better to buy 'The Complete Japanese Verb Guide,' by the Hiroo Japanese Center. Far more useful."
1,It is a mess!,"Apart from being a waste time, since there are only a few conjugation patterns in Japanese, and almost all verbs follow them regularly, the phonetic transcriptions are very confusing. Japanese has its own accurate phonetic transcriptions using the Latin alphabet (Romanji), and anyone who learns this system, will have to re-learn the proper one, which is used in Japan and in any decent book.I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
1,Waste of Money~~,"First, it does not use anything but the Roman alphabet- no furigana whatsoever. If you have a desire to know this many verbs, you will be annoyed that this book doesn't use furigana. This book attempts to directly translate all those verbs- a misleading way to learn another language. Some words have a direct translation, mostly nouns. Verbs are not this easy. Definately not 501 of them!!Also, I had a Japanese friend look at this book and tell me which forms I will use and which I won't, and he scratched out more than half listed on the page!! I wouldn't even recommend this for a Sunday learner..."
3,"Decent reference, just no Japanese characters","This verb reference is good for remembering the conjugations, but it doesn't have any kana or kanji at all, which is rather annoying, since that would make the patterns more visible. Many reviewers have complained about the transliteration used, but the fact is if you know Hiragana, or have studied linguistics in Japanese beyond beginner/intermediate level, it will make a lot of since. Any book that says Japanese consonants sound almost just like English ones (and I have seen a few books that say so) is full of crap. Anyway, since characters are very good to have, I would say check out ""The Complete Japanese Verb Guide"" which is also on Amazon. It would be more useful all around, although this 501 does have its merits."
1,Useless,"I don't know how this book ever got made. Who could possibly have thought this was a good idea? A book like this makes sense for a language that has lots of irregular verbs (French come to mind). Japan has less than a dozen irregular verbs. This makes the book utterly worthless.If the book included example sentences or detailed discussions of usage or anything else useful, I would be less harsh. The closest thing to being useful is the humble/honorific forms, but a table of 1-2 pages takes care of the special cases for that.There are plenty of other *good* ""Japanese verb"" books out there, go buy one of them instead.If I could give this book zero points I would."
2,Not very useful,"This book doesn't even spell ""shimasu"" correctly with the ""H"" it would confuse a non-native speaker like myself as to how to pronouce and spell in Japanese. As far as I'm concerned the book is not gramatically correct. Even my teacher wouldn't use it.I was very disappointed with this edition."
4,Valuable resource . . . almost,"While Roland Lange provides the information needed to help the student conjugate verbs, I find the use of this particular type of Roumaji to provide a disconnect for newer students. For example, the ""tsu"" sylabble is notated ""tu,"" and ""shi"" is notated ""si."" While this is faithful to the system being used, it is counterintuitive for newer students. And I do feel that for the more advanced student, the use of hiragana (or more genuinely, kanji) would be better."
3,Not for RV use,"You see this unit advertised for RV use, but it fits into a normal household wall socket. For an RV you need something to test the power BEFORE it gets into your RV."
4,Great Travel Bag,This bag is great for sightseeing. It is made very well. Fits a small camera and wallet and phone. The best feature is the adjustable strap and locking hooks in addition to other anti-theft features.
3,"Nice bag, but too small for me","This is a well made bag - I liked it's size as I had it over my shoulder. However it wasn't big enough inside. I needed something for 3 passports, traveler's checks, change purse, digital camera, Ipod, keys and small wallet. I wanted a zipped compartment for passports & extra money that I wouldn't have to open during the trip. There were too many compartments inside, and none big enough for 3 passports. It did have a nice look too it and not bulky, just not enough space for what I needed & I ended up returning it."
3,Too Small,I am going to Italy in a few weeks and wanted a secure purse. I should have paid more attention to a previous review that stated it was hard to open and was used by a gentleman just to use as a small camera bag. I agree and have returned the bag. I was very impressed with the quality so I ordered the next larger size.
4,good while it lasted....and then a cheerful replacement..,"nice bag until, at the 5 month time, the zipper broke..It lost several track 'teeth' and then finally separated from the zipper body.. Of course, return date was only 30 days from purchase.. unknown if I will replace with same model..leery ..am leaning toward another brand.. again, good while it lasted..seems zipper/track/plastic teeth are the weak point.. guess it will look nice as a hanging plant pot on the rear deck rail :(good luck..**********update..Although the Amaz description said warranted only for 30 days, I found out by checking the main PacSafe website that the warranty was good for much longer..contacted the company, sent the old one back and received the new up-dated model in return....excellent service needs to be commended..so thats the reason for this review edit.. good job pacsafe.."
3,Too Small,"This took a bit to arrive and when I saw it I realized it is just too small. It is meant to wear and keep close to body and will hold a phone, small camera and necessary cards/documents. That's it. I am not sure if it is worth it to have or just use a money belt instead on my trip to europe. What I like best is the strap, solid and secure. The bag itself, not so much. I will probably return and either get the larger size or do something else (the photos showing a person wearing it/them doesn't help apparently)."
3,Not the kind of film I was expecting.,"Do you know what an Allegory is? That is this movie. It is really abstract. This movie is written like a Greek play, or a Shakespear play. If that is your thing you might like this movie.However, given that I went into the film, expecting something more B-Movie thriller, less Oedipus or the Odyssey, it was kind of a disappointment.Now some would say, ""Deception"" was a complicated film with layers. Comparing that film, to this work, is like comparing Pre-Algebra to Linear Calculus.Overall the movie was somewhat entertaining. But not in a going out with your friends and partying sort of a way, more in a putting together a puzzle kind of way. I was expecting something different going in to the film.If this is the kind of film you want to see watch it. If not, you won't enjoy watching it. If you don't know what an Allegory is off the top of your head, this film will likely be very unsatisfying."
2,Too bad,"The writing, directing, pace, acting and entertainment are all here.TOO BAD...... the full story line is completely incoherent.For me, the bizare (string you along with events that make no sense at all) story is only worth telling if it actually ties together in some way eventually.I enjoyed looking forward to experience the conclusion of this tale, until it never arrived."
3,I liked it,I thought it was a watchable movie. it had a nice couple of plot twists and a good ending.Not bad at all.
3,good simplified pictures but lacking a lot,"I purchased this atlas for anatomy lab because it was recommended by my professor. Looking through the book, it has wonderful pictures and really simplified structures so you can actually see what you are looking at rather than a portion of it and the rest hidden behind other structures. However, it is not a very complete atlas. The most glaring example - there is nothing about the head and neck. I had to buy another atlas just to get through this past test. I personally recommend Netter's as a reference atlas because it has EVERYTHING in it. I know the pictures and millions of lines coming out can be overwhelming, however, if you are looking for a specific structure you are way more likely to find it in Netter's."
5,Good movie,Very inspiring. We should apreciate more our gift of practice the religion of our choice. I do not know how many of us will have the courage this young man had. With a brilliant future in front of him he decided to stay in his country living in danger to help other christian.
5,GREAT TO EXPERIENCE THE LEGEND !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I LOVE SAM COOKE AND ALL THE MUSIC THAT HE HAS CREATED. THIS CD MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS ACTUALLY THERE IN CONCERT EXPERIENCE THE LEGEND HIMSELF. GREAT CD. I LOVE IT.
2,Unhappy customer,"The Bible I ordered was advertised as ""Like New"".>> The Bible I received was not like new. It was barely acceptable.>> Like New does not contain -> 1. Red, blue and green sprawl in large letters on the inside cover.> 2. Numerous areas highlighted in yellow marker throughout the bible.> 3. Numerous areas circled in pen throughout the bible.> 4. Dirt and pencil markings along the top, side and bottom sides of the bible.> 5. Dog-eared points on the cover of the bible.>> The condition of this bible does not match the expectations I was promised. I am not happy with this purchase.I have contacted the seller about a reduction in price to match a bible in this condition but he has not responded."
2,Napoleonic naval guns,"Not much new information for anyone who has already studied this era,and I would think a bit confusing to someone who is new to it, since many of the descriptions for the gun photos are not with the correct guns. It is a good source of general information on british cannon."
4,A Brilliant Cross-Cultural Look at Totalitarianism,"Weschler is a brilliant and amazing storyteller. I had followed his work closely in the New Yorker and other publications. Written like a novel, this book is a fascinating true-life look at three totalitarian regimes through the eyes of exiles who fought dictators in their own ways. The juxtoposition of the threee unrelated experiences provides some interesting insights into what totalitarianism is at its root and how it affects the people who live under its governance."
3,Printing is off; content is great,"The printing in the book is off on the left hand page, so that the first part of each line is cut off. It's worse in the beginning of the book, where up to 2 letters are cut off. Other than that, the content of the book is great!"
4,Well done book,"I convene a Clan tent at various Scottish Games, and this is always displayed on my table. Great illustrations and historical notes."
1,Not received yet,"Product is taking longer than expected to be delivered to El Salvador, where I lived.. Can't talk about it yet.Jorge Garza"
2,Come on people...,"Look. Pay $99.00 USD, for a game in which you have to pay money monthly for an RPG, which, let's face it, isn't anything new. As I understand it, the graphics on this game aren't THAT special, I mean, I've seen better much better, and I don't see how this is any better then any MMORPG on computer, except for the fact that it's set in the FF universe. I mean, you can get something alot better on computer, I dont' see why on earth you'd want a PS2 and an Xbox when you can have a PC which can do everything those systems can do and more, for just a little more then you'd pay for a gaming system and several games. Especially if you know what you're doing and buy a custom made computer.Squauresoft is trying to screw you over... just go back to playing FFVI and Chrono Trigger, or if you want an MMORPG get one for computer. Keep them away from Consoles."
1,Square Soft Is A Bunch Of Money Scammers!,Well when I got the game I was installing it and everything then it told me I had to enter a credit card number to pay for some more things for PlayOnline... I was like what the heck i jsut pay $110.00 for this game now I have to pay $13.00 a month... Or did i jsut do something wrong and they jsut want your card number... So yeah they make you pay for having an account... That balognie...
1,"Not worth it, HDD doesnt do enough",I found FF11 to require long tracks of running to do meniel tasks. i did not enjoy it. To some it may be the best game ever made but to me it was a waste of money and time. Also the HDD doesnt do anything but play FF11 i hope this changes in the future.
2,Final Fantasy XI,"I paid alot for this game, the HDD, the PS2, and the other acessories. Now I have to pay $12.95 a month more just to play this one game. What a rip off. I can play Socom II for free. After my free 30 days trial period is over I am going to try to return the game."
4,ITS A GREAT DEAL WITH HDD INCLUDED!,"check this.-Linux kit costs 200 dollars! but it comes with a network adaptor thats ""only broadband""!!! including other stuff too.-Final Fantasy XI with the HDD thats only 100! and a keyboard is only 20! and Network adaptor is 30! <----- this is all you need! for only 150! and the only thing you need to play FFXI!plus! if you only need the HDD, this is probably the cheapest available!check this! about 30,000 people play SOCOM 2 and the game is HDD compatible! so you kno alot more people will buy this and probably play FFXI for the heck of it...i wonder if they took out FFXI, will it still be 100 dollars for the HDD and 50 for FFXI?this is a good price you guys reserve your copy now! and save intill the 23rd!!!"
5,Hmmmm,"just to say I have a JPN PS2 + hard drive and you cant copy music or anything to it like an xbox can (i am fluent in Japanese so i know from the instructions). It may be different for this HDD but i don't think so. It dosent do much for other games though (you install FFX to it and it decreases the loading time by about 1 second, and you still need the DVD to play it). All in all, unless you are planning to play FFXI or other games with HDD support its not really worth it."
1,I bought it for the HD to play SOCOM2,It currently add no benefit to SOCOM2 game play.Final Fantasy game is not a game I like.
1,waste of money,"Unless you are never going to cancel your subscription, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! The stupidest idea anyone has ever thought of: if your subscription is cancelled for more than 3 months, you must buy a new copy of the game, subscribe, and start over. Unless you paln to never cancel your subscription, I would suggest NOT buying this game."
2,You buy it for the hard drive,"When I first heard about XI I was pretty excited and could not wait for it to come out and when it did and I bought it, I was pretty disappointed. Granted the first month free got me to play it to give it a chance, but after that the monthly fee was not worth it even with the expansion. There is no plot it is just hack and slash. So for people like me who like some content to a game then this is not a game for you. This game reminds me of the original Diablo. The only good part about the game was the Hard Drive. You'll never have to buy a memory card again."
3,Great game!!! terrible support!!!,"This game is great when you can get it to play. I have cable and was unplugging my computer then plugin in the playstation 2. Sometimes it worked sometimes it did not. I called playonline.com ( the people who handle final fantasy) and they said I need to contact my cable provider. My cable provider does not support online games. I bought a router and it worked good for about a week then I got error messages. When I called customer service again they said I need to configure my router. IF that is true then why did it work before? I got tired of all the run around so I just cancelled. Like I said, the game is great, service is not. Oh yeah, NO TOLL FREE NUMBER!! When you have a problem count on a long dinstance call and count on waiting 35 minutes. I wish it would have worked out but I had enough of the run around. Funny thing, I can and have play other playstation games online fine with no problems."
1,I hate the RPG's,"What about the people who dont like RPGs? There are a few games out there that support the HDD, (SOCOM II, SP: Omega Strain and many more coming)but I have to buy a game that i really hat in order to have my HDD!!!! That's really s**t"
4,Another sad Irish story of the Civil War,We read all 3 of the trilogy for our Irish book club. Macken is a great writer. He uses the analogy of 2 brothers fighting on different sides in the civil war to show how Ireland was ripped apart once it achieved Free State status. I would argue that members of the same family were rarely if ever on different sides.
4,Scorching Wind,This was an enjoyable read and this book completed the(Irish Trilogy )for me. This is a book that was difficult to find in a local book store.
3,They could have been great..,"They had the potential of being great chips, but of the entire carton of 12 packages, none of them were fresh. I would not order them again, being apprehensive of receiving a stale item again."
4,Hearty Chip,Not a bad tortilla chip. It is very hearty and handles any type of dip with no problems. This chip travels well and does not taste overly salty.
1,12 bags of expired chips - NOT GOOD!,I ordered 12 bags of these chips in September and when I got them I found that the sell by date was 10 May 2011. What disappointment!
3,great chips,These are great chips but Amazon has went up so much on the price in the last few months that they now cost as much almost per bag as my local grocery store. I cant see buying 12 bags of tortillas at once to only save a few cents on each bag.
1,Chips were rancid,"Like other reviewers, our chips were rancid. We received our chips only a month before the expiration date and they were already going bad. We made it through a bag and a half before we had to throw them all away. It may have just been the box we received, but other reviewers have commented on it, too, so it may not be isolated. In any case, I don't think we'll be buying this brand again."
1,expired,I ordered these hoping they would be crisp and healthy. My experience with Amazon has always been prompt with fresh not expired food but not this time. The bags I received had expired 5 months previous to when I ordered them. My chips were stale.
4,Very good for organic!!!,"We were overall pleased with these chips. The only drawback is that they are a thicker chip....not the usual restaurant style, but they do have good flavor."
3,"very good until expiration date, really bad after that","I thought these chips were really good, tasty, and very few broken chips. But it took me a long time to go through 12 bags of chips, so I opened my last 2 bags after the expiration date and man they were bad - very rancid smell and taste, really inedible. But it was about 2 months past the expiration date, so I really can't complain."
2,"Rancid smell 3 months before ""best by"" date","The ingredients listed ""canola and/or safflower and/or sunflower oil,"" and I gotta assume there was a problem with canola oil since the smell of the chips gave me a Proustian flashback to my days as an aspiring artist working with oil paints. Such flashbacks can occur because of the close family ties among rapeseed, canola and linseed oils. So I guess the lesson here is don't buy these chips within, say, 5 months of the ""best by"" date unless you're an artist, because if you're truly an artist, then you're starving, and if you're starving, whaddaya care if the chips smell bad."
4,Icon of Folk Songs & Storytelling,"This is a great box set by a true master of folk songs and stories. I've been to many a Utah concert.Yet I can't give it 5 Stars. How can a 4 CD compilation omit two of his classics? :Hallelujah I'm A Bum, and Moose Turd Pie."
5,"""One big story, and we're all in it""","AK Press has really accomplished something amazing by making this boxset possible. It really is the best testament to Utah's entire musical career. As he himself puts it: ""This is what I've done with my life, kids."" And what a life it was!"
5,One of my top-5 favorites!,In one word this book is epic. It is a family-saga/ historical fiction wonder. Absolutely must read!
5,Nostalgia,"What can I say? This was a favorite of mine when it came out and I haven't heard it since turntables went by the wayside years ago. I couldn't believe it, but I remembered every song, word-for-word. It's a great disc to sing along to in the car."
2,Not so good!,"I tought that this movie was going to tell you the real secrets of Air Force One, but it only talks about the story of the airplane since Nixon, and then it just tells you that it is cassified everything about it, so not so many details. I didn't like it."
3,"its ac/dc live, what more do you want?","although ac/dc has always been great live, this isnt the best recording of them. the sound is just okay, the songs go on a little too long (bad boy boogie in particular keeps going on and on, & without angus's flashing to distract from the boring boogie, its a skipover), and the band isnt as tight. i'm not saying its bad, it just could've been better. it is better than their much later live album, but not as good as the live material on the bonfire box. one of the great covers of all time though!"
3,It rocks but questionable song selection!,"This album should have been awesome. Bon was at his best, Angus was ripping and everyone else was top notch. The only problem I had was the song selection. Riffraff, RnR Damnation, and Bad Boy Boogie are good songs, but they are definitely not as good as Sin City, Live Wire, TNT, and Down Patment Blues. How could they leave those off? What they play here rocks but it could have been a lot better."
1,I Can't Belive It,"AC/DC was doing so great before this, then they runed.Bad song selection and mastering."
5,the real live album from the boys,"Bon Scott at his lecherous,leering animalistic best.The crowd was totally into it and you will be to.You can count on 3 things in life: death,taxes and AC/DC concerts!"
5,"If you want the best, you found it!!!!","Gotta tell you all I'm now 34 and have been an avid DC fan since the age of 10. This album is the ultimate in Rock n Roll without exception. You will NEVER EVER hear anything like this. It's raw, mean, smutty, loud and massive. If you die without hearing this, pray to God that it's playing in heaven coz this is the most phenomenal recording ever produced, trust me. The legend that is Bon Scott along with Angus and the boys make every other Rock band embarrasingly ordinary . . . Oh yeah, one more thing, play it so loud that your ear drums are in danger of bleeding. It's the best way . . . . . Buy it, buy it, buy it . . . . ."
5,They know what Rock'n'Rll is really about!!,"When I listened to this live recording for the first time I was not really interested in AC/DC. At that point of my life I just cared about Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer and stuff like that. It was a close friend of mine who convinced me (after half a dozen beers) to listen to it and, oh hell, it was just GREAT!! You can get the real spirit of rock'n'roll in all of its chords. Angus is simply a force of nature in this concert and Bon Scott... Well, let's just say that he's one of a kind."
5,Powerful,"This live set is amazing. I am recently turned 30, and remember listening to it over and over in junior high school right after Bon Scott died. The interesting combination of metal, blues and kind of a rockabilly hasnt been heard this crisp and clear by THESE ears since. You MUST buy it!"
5,Question ?,"Yes, this is one of the best the almost original AC/DC came up with, but I have one question. On the album/CD sleeve it claims the album is made up of concerts in numerous continents including Australia. Being an Australian fan, I recall AC/DC never toured this country as a headline act before 1981 (when Brian Johnson was singer). So, which tracks are included from Australian concerts ?"
1,Poor Choice for Busy Office,This machine actually has a piece of carbon paper on a roll that you have to re-roll or replace every time it runs out. It's unbelievable in this information age to have to deal with such a rinky-dink set-up. The copies aren't consistent at all. There are much better choices available.
1,Not worth the paper,"This FAX machine is not worth the paper you'll print messages on. It comes with a ribbon reminiscent of some manual typewriter you discarded in the pre-computer era, except that that old typewriter did a better job. Incoming FAXes are barely legible, a fact you'll discover after you've spent your entire evening trying to set this bozo up. Outgoing FAXes work better. The phone part is a lightweight piece of junk. I didn't get so far as any incoming messages. ..."
3,slow send and receive,Tried everything stated in manual and find that you really don't know when you are sending or receiving a fax without checking the log after the fact. A fax receive is forever and you sit there and wonder if it is going to happen. Also hard to control the volume on message center when in the MC mode. Would not be a machine I would use if I were in ANY type of business climate that would require professionalism (if that's a word).It's O.K. for the price but don't look for a gem and also don't look for too much support. Had some trouble with send receive response with Brother.
3,Buy it only because it's an excellent fax machine,"This ""Brother 885MC"" is an excellent small office fax machine; not fast but does what it needs to do. However, I miss my Panasonic because it had an excellent ""Message Center"" (i.e. answering machine) while the MC on this product is poor and it's remote capability is even worse. While it does support paging it is frustrating to retrieve messages remotely and you cannot selectively delete mesages. Apparently the Message Center was somthing they did not really want to add to this product. Buy this product for the fax capability, pretend it doesn't have a MC. BTW: they allow you to connect an answering machine to a supplied jack; plan on it!"
1,"Crappy, flimsy cartridge. Impossible to replace.","I hate this fax.Trying to insert a new cartridge is an exercise in frustration. I've been at it for a half hour now, and can't figure it out."
1,disgruntled,"Sometimes we received our faxes, and other times we got blank papers. Also had problems faxing. Called Brother and they are in the process of replacing it..... hope it works better. We know it isn't our phone line because we have an all-in-one printer and when we hook it up to that machine we received every fax."
1,drywall dolly,when it arrived there was no hardware with it. The company said they would send me a replacement. i never recieved it. I bought the required hardware myself and put it together. This product is garbage. This wont even hold 2 sheets of drywall without falling over. And wont hold much of anythign else either without falling over.
3,Drywall Cart,"Price is good. All four wheels do not swivel. Would work better if all 4 swiveled. Not for heavy duty jobs, but works well for smaller projects."
5,Great shoes!,"I got these shoes for my husband, and he loves them. They look nice with jeans or khakis."
5,Excellent,This is great. The Lousianna Purchase is a deal I would like to make. This is a very interesting and informative look at the expedition that I really enjoyed. You like history? You will like this.
2,Rose Colored Presentation,"I do not appreciate the white washed, candy coated version of history that Ken Burns frames. The G-rated-NPR-on-the-weekend vibe is a wet blanket on the fire of real life events. Sure, this will resonate with people that subscribe to the half alive way of life. But don't forget dummy, you're being fed a formula. Sorry if this ruffles your synthetic feathers.I read Empire of the Summer Moon this past year. If you're interested in an unfiltered lens check it out. Or, stick to your rose-colored glasses. Hey, on a positive note: if you don't filter things well yourself, you might as well stick with someone who does it ""well.""Have a nice day suckers. : )"
3,Beginners Only,"This would have been great if I was doing a report in school and had no previous knowledge of the expedition. After reading Steven Ambrose's, ""Undaunted Courage"", the movie did not provide any new knowledge. The book is obviously way more detailed. It's the details that make the journey...not the highpoints."
4,Moving Documentary from Ken Burns,"The documentary by Ken Burns covers the travel of Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery. In true Burns style, there are talking heads about Lewis and Clark especially from Stephen Ambrose who wrote a bestselling history book about the Corps. The story is very moving and provides essential information about their journey. A difficulty with the story which I found tested my attention span was that there is only one journal and one point of view about the travels. Burns does provide some supposed insight from native american groups along the way but most is speculation on how they might have seen the corps. The photography is limited to nature pictures and historical photos of native americans from about 1900. This can't really be helped but sometimes tests my ability to really pay attention to the story. Well done but Burns has been able to use his style in other series better."
5,Lewis and Clark Rock!,Ken Burns triumphs again with this fascinating documentary about the Lewis and Clark expedition. These men were amazing and Burns captures their stunning achievement brilliantly. Well worth the viewing!
5,BURNS BEST WORK,"His big series on the ""Civil War"" and ""Baseball"" get all the hype but,with Hal Holbrook narrarting and a ""who's who"" in history backing him up with the running color commentary, this is his most engrossing work. This documentary gives you a real sense of accomplishment when you have finished and if you can resist reading about the expedition after you've seen it, then check your pulse I think you need a doctor. The basis of the movie is the journals kept by Lewis and Clark during the trip. They were truly diverse men that could not only handle the hardships of the journey but, eloquently place the events in writing. Any fiction writer would be pressed to keep you as interested as the actual events recorded. This is fantastic stuff."
5,"Lewis & Clark, The Corps of Discovery","Excellent, Awesome photography. Narration very well done and the historians made the story come alive."
5,Lewis and Clark DVD,"I am a history buff and have read books on the Lewis and Clark expedition, and this movie is a terrific complement to the cold information in the books. I have recommended this to all my friends. If you liked this movie, you should read ""Undaunted Courage"" by Steven Ambrose; it is a real page turner."
5,great book,"This is a great book, an easy read, and a new way of thinking to better manifest what you want and how to help others with their manifestations (whole system thinking)"
1,A Lot of Hot Air,"If you're looking for a book to tell you how to manifest something you want, this book is NOT it. The first third of the book is just an introduction about the author's life at Findhorn (who cares?). The book is extremely repetitive telling you ad nauseum about how everything is all one and you're divine (heresy?). The prose is so dense that reading it is like walking down a long hallway filled with cotton candy. He doesn't give clear directions on HOW to manifest anything (e.g., do A, B, & C, and you'll get result D). If you want to learn to manifest, this book is a waste of time."
1,This is not an MP3 player,"Read carefullyI returned my product shortly after purchase.+ The sound in this machine is pretty good I must admit.- It is NOT an Mp3 player. I forces you to use a software program produced by less skilled programmers. It flat out refused to work in my computer. Had to resort to ""SonicStage alternatives"", to load the player.It's slow- Loading the player is painfully slow. It takes forever. (One of the alternative programs even warned me before transfering a big chunk of music ""Warning this may take a lot of time do you still wish to proceed"")- Wind/Rewing painfully slow.- You have to sort everything (every track) yourself, I mean it 2007 now.If you are a user who frequently change your audiofiles in your MP3 player this product is not for you.Rumor has it that Sony will release a ""unlocked"" player which will work as a ""normal"" MP3 player shortly (no SonicStage necessary). I recommend you wait for that one."
1,Don't waste money on this one,The included software is very hard to use and most stupidly written. I add wma files to the library and convert them to Sony's supported format. Then I delete the wma files from both computer and library from within the software. The software will delete the converted files also from the computer though they are neither in the library nor in wma format. How stupid can Sony get?The player sometines doesn't recognize some wma files. All files have to be converted to a different format. The player control itself are hard to use. The player's USB port stopped working within 45 days of purchase. Sony support says that my only repair option is to have the player exchanged with a refurbished one even though the player is under full parts and labor warranty. DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER.
4,Too bad for Atrac,"Atrac is a far superior file format than MP3, but this plays MP3's too. Too bad Sony didn't just drop the proprietary nature of Atrac."
5,ótimo,"Very good purchase.Only the Sony software to send music to player is not good.Because if you put a file "".MP3"" in pen drive, the music not will be played. Only if you put the file through Sony software."
4,great MP3 player,"Bought it a couple of weeks ago and love my new MP3 player. It is very easy to use, charges quickly though the USB port and it is just so cute (girl thing)."
3,no flag pole,"Good product, although I thought it would come with a the small flag pole that is pictured. I probably just didn't look close enough, but it's hard to find a flag pole the right size for the flag."
4,A great book for the beginner/intermediate writer.,I picked up this book in the bargain section and was glad that I did. The tips and advice that McCollister gives are based on his experience but are presented in a way that makes them useful for just about any writer. Definitely a good source of ideas for turning one's creative energies into something profitable.
5,BEST BAND,"I DON'T HAVE THIS & DO NOT GET INTO BOOKS BUT, BECAUSE THEY ARE MY FAVORITE BAND I'LL GIVE IT A 5 STAR rateing"
1,cheap binder rings,My son used this for only a few weeks and one of the rings broke already! Needs stronger binder rings!
5,"Small, sleek and sexy",A must-have for any Ravens fan- it looks awesome on the back of my car and it was super easy to put on.
1,"Looks great, but doesn't work","I recently purchased this clock as a Christmas gift. The graphic on the clock is cool, but the clock does not work. I even tried a new battery but within an hour the time is way behind. A waste of money."
5,Awesome!!!,"""Because of You"" as the young folk say is ""Off The Hook"" :). I am a Gospel Radio Announcer for AM 1240 WAVN out of Southaven, MS. On Saturday mornings I host a Ministry called, MARY'S Radio Outreach Ministry, 7am -10am. One of the songs I play for my Praise and Worship segment is: ""Because of You."" Today I saw Joohnny perform ""Because of You"" on TV (Jeff's show); after seeing and hearing Johnny, I now have greater respect, appreciation, and feel for the song.There is truly a message that need to be heard.Keep up the good work & Please add me to your mailing list.Evangelist Mary ""Mockinbird"" MartinMy Ministry Mailing Address is:1784 Nellie RoadMemphis, TN 38116901-494-5412"
4,RED -- not white led's!!,"Product is great if you're looking for a RED LED bulb. Product page does not say specifically what color it is, I was thinking it was going to be white, but turns out they are RED LED's.Whatever, luckily red works for me just as well."
1,RED,"These are RED LEDS!!!!!! I thought they were white, I wanted them for my backup ligths, and turned out to be RED!!!! The color is not specified in the product description."
1,bummer!!!,"I thouht I was ordering a clear, white bright light for back-up lamps, but the bulb I received was a red one, not as expected. Did not reurn the bulb as it was not worth the time and bother to hassle with it and drive ti the post office to mail it!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THESE!!! They are supposed to be WHITE LED's but they sent me six RED ones!,DO NOT BUY THESE!!! I bought six white LED's and was sent six RED LED's which are wothless.
1,TOTALLY MISLEADING AD,"What a bunch of BS this turned out to be we needed to replace 1 bulb and wanted to switch to LED so we ordered this one it came today and guess what? IT'S RED LEDS?? Why wouldn't you say something in the ad or description? Show a red bulb, say it's a red led...anything to let the buyer know..And to make things worst Amazon won't replace it with a white one, won't give us a refund, won't do anything!! Heck of a way to run a business BUYER BEWARE!!"
1,Dead on Arrival,Dead on Arrival. I never seem to have luck with the cheaper LED lighting.. I will just have to buy the more expensive ones.Returning an item this inexpensive is non productive in my workday.
3,Disappointing,"The book is nearly 30 years old, and when published caused a considerable political and cultural storm. It attempted to discuss/analyse the social and poltiical mores of Australia, and tried to provide a critique of what was then 'good' and 'bad'. Having read the book recently, it surprised me how this pamphlet could have caused the fuss it did. Perhaps as the sequel to THE LUCKY COUNTRY, and given the title the hype preceeded it a little. Worth a read for hisotoricval context, but not much more."
1,Weak Build,"The tripod head was never strong to begin with and after only a few uses with a Powershot SD630 the tightening screw cracked apart the entire head.Naively, I purchased a second Mini only to have the same thing happen in the exact same way. I think I'll stick to camera beanbags nowadays."
1,cheap junk,"This is the type of product where you either get lucky and it works correctly, or you don't an it's completely useless. Mine was junk."
3,"Explicit, but not really that hot","Generally I love ""wet""-themed soft-core, and I love explicit soft-core, and this title is both (more explicit than most Peach titles). But still, something is lacking. The women aren't the hottest (not enough all-naturals) and the vignettes are paced a little poorly where the timing of everything feels a little bit off. There has to be some build-up and anticipation to these things."
2,Some girls need to shave!,"It's kinda boring. Some girls look good but it's not very entertaining. I was surprised that some of them didn't shave their bush. I mean a little trim would be nice, it doesn't have to be bald. Another chick had sand all up in her crack which wasn't to apealing either. I wouldn't buy it but I would borrow it."
2,"Ponderous, elephantine, somnolent","It's fun to run through the thesaurus of invective when you hate something and get a free shot at it. I'm glad for anyone who gets pleasure from Claudio Arrau's sleep-inducing ""majestic power."" Every bar of these two Brahms concertos is offered on a platter of self-importance, without the slightest imaginaiton or inner life. Arrau is the perfect curator for dead music, and if Brahms ever had a chance to lose his reputation for over-earnest clumsiness, Arrau nails it right back up. Giulini plows along in tow. There's a reason these recordings have been out of the catalog for a long time--they deserve it."
4,Tony Watkins--fan and critic,"I'm a big fan of the Philip Pullman books. I consider him to be an excellent writer and storyteller. However, the ""His Dark Materials"" books deal with issues that need to be thought over and discussed carefully. I appreciated this book as a well-thought out and interesting look at Philip Pullman's background, his personal views, his goals in writing the books, and the historical and religious background behind the books. I especially appreciated the author's candid expression of his enjoyment of the books. He admitted that he was a fan of Philip Pullman, while disagreeing with his message. I enjoyed seeing a Christian opinion of the book that fully appreciated Philip Pullman's wonderful storytelling, but still seriously considered anti-Christian or anti-Church messages in the trilogy."
5,"For once, an intelligent, not embarrassingly biased, contribution of criticism.","This is an excellent read for all those who are at all affected by Pullman's trilogy, directly or indirectly. It provides thorough understanding without scathing criticisms; even when Watkins has a disagreement with Pullman, he does not go on to verbally bash his material. He provides an EDUCATED opinion, then goes on to the next subject. Watkins is so far the most respectable critic that I have read, simply because he himself respects the views of others without denouncing them. Sometimes I myself disagreed with his arguements, but not disrespectfully, because again, his arguements and stances were educated instead of condescending.Narrow-minded writers and critics like Peter Hitchens should take a dose of Watkins's style."
1,"Good, but not good enough...the heroine just wasn't there!","Mountain Laurel was a pretty good book...but I just didn't thought it was complete enough because the heroine, Maddie, just wasn't the heroine that should have been there. In my opinion, I think Jude made Maddie way too concieted, selfish, and and way too vain. First of all, Maddie keeps on saying that her voice is the best in the world, and in my opinion, that's way too vain! I couldn't stand it! And she's selfish because all she cared about was herself and not anything about 'Ring. She just wanted him to follow her around the world to listen to her sing, and she didn't care a cinch about 'Ring's Warbrooke Shipping Co. All she cared about was her own life, and how she has to sing...blah blah blah! But I'll give Jude some credit on 'Ring, the hero. He was nice, kind, and sweet. All he did was think of the best, but no...Maddie didn't care. All she thought about was herself. In my opinion, this book does not even deserve a star."
4,If you love Jude Deveraux...you'll love this too!,"Basically if you like an easy read with a romance, funny comments, and declarations of love in the end...then this book is for you. It's not highly intelligent or factually correct, but it's cute and warms your heart. If you then also have a little knowledge of opera, or just like it, then you'll probably get this book and the characters a little bit better too. I loved it! Hope you will too!"
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I love Jude Deveraux's other books, but this one was so hard to relate to, I couldn't even finish it. Pompous opera singers are just not people I run across or care about. Sorry. Give us more like ""Wishes"" or ""Knight in Shining Armor""."
3,The best Jude Deveraux novel,"This is the best Jude Deveraux novel. I have read most of her books, and this is by far the best. It is the least sexist, and the man is not as arrogant as some of her other men have been. The fact that most of her men are arrogant -- along with other non-desirable qualities -- turns me off from some of her books. So if you want to read a Jude Deveraux book, read this one."
3,Laugh out loud dialogue,"This book was a good read. The dialogue had me laughing outloud. The author portrayed a very real dilemma between a dual career relationship. It was nice to see a historical romance take the heroins career and give it equal importance to the hero. Opera parts were a little boring, but all in all, this book was worth reading."
2,I was bored.,"I like the montgomery series, but I was bored with this one. I just like how in some books small details from other books in the series are mentioned. Like Ghost Island was briefly mentioned in this book and I had just read The Raider. I think stuff like that is creative and cute. But over all the story was just not interesting to me."
2,Silly,"I've liked alot of books by this author, but not this one. If you are over the age of 15, it seems rather silly that the man and woman are forever fighting, acting like they don't like eachother, but of course, are attracted to eachother. And I got rather sick of him pinning her down and her clawing and fighting to get loose. Oh, please...I listened to this on audio, which often times makes a not-so -good book okay, but in this case it made it even worse. The reader was really bad, kept speed-reading and added nothing to the characters. So be warned, if you are considering this on audio, don't. Even if I had been reading this in print , I still think it's basically a stupid book. (sorry, but that's how I feel it is)"
1,San Ignacio de Loyola,Can't watch & understand the movie at all and also no subtitle to read. I want to return the movie back to the sender.
1,Warning,"Perhaps a warning to people who think about purchasing this book: apperantly it's made by scanning in an older version and using a computer to recognise the letters or something like that. This means the book is full of annoying SPELLING MISTAKES and that there are NO TITLES AT ALL (!). The book is just text, nothing to organise it, while a book like this REALLY needs structure.If this is the only option to get your hands on this book, if you can read past the numerous mistakes and if you are organised enough to think all the titles along, then you might consider buying this item. Otherwise I advise you to STAY AWAY FROM IT."
3,Gotta love them to own this one,"Being the 80's nut I am, I was excited to get my hands on this CD. Track 1. Popmuzik helped define an era I loved. While it never fails to thrill me, the subsequent tracks bombed with one brilliant exception. Track 12. Moonlight and Muzak ['92 Remix] was an unexpected (and until then an unheard) treat. A bit pricy to find out you only like two tracks. Buy the tracks if you can and save yer dough."
4,Interesting...,"I heard of this album from my son and decided to buy it for my collection. No regrets at all. Very nice disco music. All songs are good, a couple of them outstanding."
3,The American Sign Language Puzzle Book,I was sort of disapointed cuz someone already wrote things in it I knew it was a used book.. I assumed it was an old book but didnt realized that things were written in it.
3,Good,This book is pretty helpful. I found that the answer key didn't match the signs on a few pages but very helpful none the less.
5,Fun way to keep up with your sign skills,"As a ASL 103 student I was looking for a fun way to study my ASL when I don't have a second person to quiz me. .after browsing many of the ASL books on Amazon, I came across this one and I love it!! It has good illustrations and there is also a tutorial at the beginning of the book that tells you how to read the illustrations.I would suggest this workbook to anyone who is serious about learning ASL and need a little something extra to study on the go!!"
5,ASL Puzzle book,"Daughter loves it, can't wait to start using it. Lots of variation and interesting. Good for various skill levels. Easy to read."
3,Diminished Expectations,"I have been trying to find a suitable production of ""The Nutcracker"" ballet to entertain my (adult) children when we gather here at our home for the holiday season. The word tradition has crossed my mind. I have a very good home theatre set up.Upon viewing the Kirov version of this ballet, I was both pleased anddisappointed. The sound was okay and the picture quality was so so.What shocked me was the blatent emission of several key scenes from this production.The ""growing"" Christmas tree, The woman who hid all those children under her extra large dress and the ""Sugar Plum Fairy"" episode were very annoying.While the two featured artists were quite talented, I think, given all the talent of the Kirov, other dancers should have been featured in more scenes."
2,Favorite author of mine but,"Egan is great at non-fiction but at least this fiction attempt held nothing of interest. Weak story, phrasing and word skills lacking and character development mostly missing."
1,Zero Stars,"I've never read such a crummy, outdated and useless computer book in my life. Korn shell? Sure, 20 years ago. File management is just links and grep? Riiiight. You really use dtmail? That's the best one I've heard in a long time buddy. I'm returning my copy pronto."
3,Lack of Description,"I am a novice attemting to acquire sufficient knowledge to select a service! I can't determine what specifically the ""National IN Calling"" means is this usable only on weekends and nights, to whom and from whom? Also incoming calls from say Canada how is this charged. I'm lost at this point. What phones recommended for this service? Thankyou for clarification!"
5,Just what I wanted,"I put this heating unit in my 18' X 24' well insulated shed and it is just what I wanted. When I leave it for the day, I turn it all they way down and it keeps the shed warm enough so nothing freezes. It got down to 1 degree outside a couple of days ago and the unit worked fine. I would recommend this item."
2,A Fancy Pot Boiler,"There's a big hole in the center of this book where the personality of the protagonist ought to be. It seems that the author, after having spent time in a German think-tank and needing to mine some gold out of it, hobbled together a novel from his impressions of Berlin, to which he added an incredibly thin plot revolving around the crisis of his 60ish film-making hero. The writing is very, very pretty, but not always clear. Sentences don't just run on but run amok. Everone talks alike. The action, what there is of it, is poorly motivated. There are numerous digressions, while seeming essentials are absent. The saving grace is what one learns about political and cultural thinking in today's re-unified East Germany."
5,Great sequel,Read when in high school & loved it. A great follow up to the first book & very much enjoyed to read it again. Great ghost story.
4,"High quality box set, but no new DVD material","Length:: 0:20 MinsThis review is for the Complete Series; this box set includes all five seasons of the show.Each season has between four and six discs (20 DVDs in total), and the discs are stored inside five standard clear DVD-sized cases (one per season). The five cases are stored inside a very thick and sturdy box. Also included is a slipcover that wraps around the outer box.Overall, this set is very high-quality box set that fans of the show will love. However, in terms of actual DVD content, there is nothing exclusive to the complete series set. So if you already own each season separately then there really is no reason to upgrade (unless you really like the outer box)."
5,crossing cultures,The last reviewer commented on being african american. I am japanese american and can contest that the same behavior occurs in japanese community. It is any man that could follow this Script...it IS behavior crossing culturaL boundaries.
3,100% Absolutely Predictable? Dubious Title.,"I read this book quickly cover to cover. I did recognize the behaviors described and, yes, lots of cheaters display them. 100% of cheaters, though, absolutely not. The authors seemed to write the book based on guys with good jobs with lots money. I know cheaters who just want out. They have no money to hide and they just bolt. It is still a valuable read, though, for anyone suspecting infidelity or wanting to prevent it or nip it in the bud. I think it was candidly written with an eye on helping spouses face a difficult situation. Most importantly, it will let the reader know that they are not alone and not going crazy."
4,Spot on behavior.,"I read this 7 years ago while my husband and I were splitting. He followed the script almost to the letter, but would never admit he was cheating. For years, I wondered - trying to figure it out, as his mistress is also married - to a really great guy who treats her way better than my ex ever treated me. I finally got the proof I was looking for. Despite my doubts, the script was dead on! I'm not sure all the advice is good, but if your husband is exhibiting this behavior - don't second-guess. If it will help your emotional state to know for sure, hire an investigator and let yourself move on."
1,"worst book ever - trite, offensive, bad advice","The authors give advice of either be compliant or get a divorce lawyer. No deeper insights into human psyche or human nature. Authors seem to have no business or credentials to be giving advice, which in some cases seems dangerous. Offensive to all parties involved. Gave me absolutely zero insight. Could have gotten better insight from a teen magazine. Don't waste your money or time."
4,Insightful and Spot On. A Book Every Married Person Should Read.,"This is an extremely good summary of how men and women behave during the final stages of a marriage break-up. In almost ALL breakups, there is another person involved, i.e. the person wanting to leave wants to leave to start/continue an affair with a third party. This book tells how men behave when they're the ones doing the leaving.The authors insistence on a ""script"" that is followed is most clever and makes sense based on what I've observed among my friends. If you're over 30, this book will ring very true to you. We've all seen this behaviour again and again.My one complaint is that the book tends to bring issues up and then ignore them or not give them the exploration they deserve. All in all, though, this book is an important addition to the popular literature on marriage and divorce and is well worth your time and dollars."
5,Clever!,"Very clever! I love how The Script is written like a screenplay with an overture, acts with scenes, and a finale. All the different scenes and scenarios make for a quick and easy read. Plus, there's lots of useful ""props"" to help ""pause"" and ""stop, "" ideally ""rewind,"" but even ""eject."""
1,Silly Bitter Hogwash,"Equally insulting to both men and women, this book is short on research and long on bitterness. Reading this was like spending a long car trip with your most whiney, negative, self-deluded friend. Painting women as dupes and men as predictable is so cliche, I can't believe any publisher thought it was a novel subject."
1,Chick-pocrisy,"I may be a little cynical, but women who write books like this seem to regard infidelity as a ""crime"" perpetrated exclusively by men against women, and this is not so. Would the authors of this book consider writing a book about how a husband can tell whether or not his wife is engaging in an adulterous relationship?Chick-pocrisy, obviously, is a combination of chick and hypocrisy. Chicks tend to believe that events like infidelity are heinous crimes when committed by men but are just unfortunate when committed by women or ""chicks"". If a man cheats on his wife, he should suffer the most severe penalties. If a wife is unfaithful to her husband, we must understand what her husband did to drive her to infidelity."
1,The Script: The 100% Absolutely Predicatable Things Women Say When They're Bitter,"This book should be in the Adult Humor section of your local library or bookstore and should under no circumstances be taken seriously. Its an interesting read have you need to fertilize your lawn or if you just need a quick laugh. This book is written from the perspective of two divorced women, they say all men follow the same script when cheating, and it must be the men. If they can see that pattern with all the men, why not flip the script and see what all these women have in common to drive these men to commit such acts of selfishness, cruelty, and hatred. Certainly these women arent your 1950's perfect housewives."
4,Book arrived as described. Decent content. Nothing Earth moving inside.,"This book is funny. There is no ""new information"" in the content, however. Well, I guess that depends on your life experience, but not for me. Still, it is good for a laugh and to spend a little time with others that have walked in your shoes."
5,An outstanding volume,"What if all text books were this gripping and balanced? They'd all be classics -- and would be read by many types of people, not just students.This is the best textbook I have ever read. It is full of insights and information that are unique or difficult to find anywhere else.Wish there was more up-to-date material on prions and a discussion of fibromyalgia, but they can be considered for the next revision. I'd also like to see greater consideration of bipolar disorder, which seemed to get less treatment than it deserves.Even scholarly readers will reach for the dictionary occasionally. A glossary might be considered for future volumes.Well done, gentlemen."
5,Lovely Music,We have these chimes just outside of our front door. Their tone is such a friendly melody in a cheerful major key. It's a pleasure to ring them just as we head out the door!
4,A trilogy that ages well,"I first read this trilogy as a kid and although I enjoyed the dinosaur stuff, I didn't quite get the evolutionary subplot. Re-reading it now, I find a lost world story with a difference. The beings who evolve individually over days (rather than the gradual evolution of centuries) are a unique concept in the sf/fantasy genre. Burroughs manages to meld this concept with a sharp adventure story that involves several groups of lead characters to create a fascinating story. A must for those who only know Burroughs by way of Tarzan."
2,"Great ideas, shame about the books","I loved these books as a kid. Reading them now, I am confronted with the fact that Burroughs was a very poor writer, with little literary ability and a poor ear for dialogue. What he did have was an imagination, and the concept of Caspak- a place where evolution happens to the individual is a fascinating one. However, Burroughs' leaden style weighs it down, and the fact that Burroughs was clearly an obsessive racist (a subhuman race is described as 'negroid') makes this a hard book to read. A rare case where the book is worse than the film (those who have seen it will know what I mean!) I not with amusement that this is a large print edition, which, combined with Burroughs' amateur scribbling, would make it seem like a kids book."
3,cases,"I ordered this cd GROOVE ON and when i recieved it, the case was crushed. I was very dissappointed"
2,Movie director's input ruined a good (not great) ballet,"I've watched a lot of movies over the past 50 years, and I think I'm in a position to say that it's very likely that the director of this movie never got a job as director of a movie again. That's how badly he directed this version of Giselle. I also have watched some excellent ballet DVDs in the past year, so I knew that this ballet had to have been performed better. I bought the Giselle by the La Scala ballet company with Alessandra Ferri as Giselle, and thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Giselle on film,"We just bought this DVD. Images are beautiful and sound quality is excellent. Carla Fracci's dancing is superb. At times, the filming adds value e.g. by including snapshots of forests and lakes. At times, the rapid-cut editing and the close-ups are a bit disturbing. In spite of those minor grudges, we warmly recommend buying this beautiful DVD."
1,A horrific Giselle!,"I want my money back! what an awful Giselle! Poor Carlotta Grisi is probably doing turnsin her grave. Carla Fracci, who is usually divine in the part of the exquisite Giselle!wasawful! What an insult! she did not let her hair down during the Mad Scene! The hair must belet loose during the sublime scene of madness. Carlotta Grisi did it, and, it should always bedone! Please, do not disfigure the classics! Show some respect! If you want modern, go toTwyla Tharp, the idiot who owns the stupidest ugliest must repulsive taste in ballet (if youcan call Frank Sinatra ballet!) retarded! Chany Catala"
4,Plenty of Tippy Toe,"I can see how the fast-jump cuts of this film would annoy the ballet fan. Not being one, however, the over-active camera didn't bother me. I appreciated seeing the performance from different angles and the close-ups of the dancers' faces. This sort of thing makes up for the loss of the immediacy of a live performance. Perhaps a less aggressive director would have done a better job, but there's really nothing wrong with this film.I bought the DVD since I realized I'd never watched a non-Tchaikovsky ballet. Adolphe Adam's music sounds rather anonymous in comparison. I did enjoy the dancing especially that of the corps-de-ballet. I still prefer opera though."
4,Sudoku is supposed to be done on the toilet!,"As I've told more than one person, Sudoku is supposed to be done on the toilet. Much more simple thanThe Essential Book of Su Doku: The World's Most Popular Puzzle Game, this set of puzzles is for the novice at best. Ranging in levels from ""monkey with a pencil"" to ""slow 7-year old,"" this set of puzzles only provides a minor distraction for someone who has done more than a few Sudoku puzzles. Given that I'm essentially aRain Manof Sudoku, this collection lasted no time at all. Appropriately titled, because each puzzle took me a single sitting, it's a good thing it wasn't titled, ""Sits & Solve Easy Sudoku,"" because that would have been false advertising.Highly recommended for the logic novice or person confused by Tic-Tac-Toe strategy, it's a fun beginning to the phenomenon of Sudoku.Jason Elin"
1,DO NOT BUY!!! Buyer Beware!,"I fell for this too. Big error by production company Laguna Films. This is not the right movie that is on the cover of the DVD Box. Production company wanted to put this movie out right away to make money and did not even bother to check if they put outb the right one. On the DVD box they have the titled film which was released in 1971; however, the DVD itself is another movie from 1953 titled ""Padre Nuestro"" featuring Eva ""Chachita"" Munoz. What a big goof off confusing the two movies. I recommend caution when buying DVDs from Laguna Films...Shows you the side of companies just caring to make the fast buck.....Despite this, the movie on the DVD is actually good movie from 1953, but buyers are expecting to see the one featured on the box."
5,I have a bunch of cd's for beginners and no one compare to this one.,"If you care about the visual then you won't enjoy this cd and you prob won't learn dancing, trust me I tried quiet a but of cd's and some are ok but nothing gives you the simplicity and detailed information, with simple steps that are explained good and someone who actually take his time so you can fallow his steps. this is an actual learning cd unlike most of them which have nice background, and some guys dancing in dark and just trying to look cool.Bottom line I'm not a great reviewer, but from someone like me and you, since you are looking for a beginner cd this is the best first time cd!!"
3,Perfect for work,These are sitting in my cube right now. The sound is just fine if you're not planning on cranking the volume.
4,"Love this printer, but ...","I haven't run into any of the problems mentioned by a few reviewers. I love the speed and quality of this printer for the price. It's worked very well with both text and images. And upgrading the memory was a piece of cake, and well worth doing.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that, after you've printed PLENTY of pages, it starts hassling you about the toner cartridge. That is, it won't print even when the pages are still coming out with plenty of toner. I keep having to fiddle with it just to get out another few pages. And YES, I am using a Brother toner cartridge and not some ""compatible"" cartridge.I would appreciate having it tell me when I'm low on toner, but don't like that it keeps me from printing when the pages still look good. Now, off to order a toner cartridge. ..."
1,Not good for the casual home user,"I started out with the Brother HL-1240 printer. After only having it for 3 months, and still being disturbed with its light printing quality, it started to print gray and black bands on the edges of the paper. It progressed with time. Customer support, after a week of waiting for a response, told me to replace the drum/toner.I did. It cost quite a bit for a new drum -- almost as much as a new printer!Foolishly, 6 months ago, I bought this HL-1440 as a replacement. BIG MISTAKE! It started doing the same thing. Turns out, the drum is the same one as used in the 1240.I'm a casual user, printing only a couple pages at a time. Perhaps this printer isn't built for it. You can find my printer on eBay..."
3,Gets Ugly after first year,"The first nine months of owning this printer, I would have rated it a 5-Star. But starting in the tenth month, the vertical and horizontal lines started appearing, and then grey-out of more and more of the pages. The printer indicator lights tell me it needs a new toner cartridge, but that's not the problem, as the toner cartridge is relatively new. The instructions say it's time to install a new drum when cleaning it myself no longer works. A new drum [is expensive]. I guess I'm going to have to just trash this printer now."
1,"Good at first, downhill to VERY BAD!!!","At first, the printer seemed too good to believe. Fast, no jams, just perfect for lots of printing. Within 6 months, it started cranking out GREY PAGES. Like everyone else, I bought new toner but that didn't help. The grey pages obliterate any printing I try to do. A new drum costs at least $130. Be very careful of the reconditioned ones because they can hide the grey page problem for a short while but it's the drum that is bad. All in all, Brother took me for $250 and the new toner which is full but unusable. When someone posts on here after having a printer a week, you do everyone a disservice because you say great things without any experience to back it up. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BROTHER."
3,Printer eventually had trouble grabbing the paper,"It was working reliably for years but it had trouble grabbing the paper eventually. My previous printer, a HP inkjet, had the same issue. Do the rollers lose effectiveness over time? I had to help the printer grab the paper to successfully print. The problem went away eventually. I am a casual user who is still using the original ink cartridge. I don't think I will replace it when it becomes empty. A new printer on sale would not be much more than a quality ink cartridge replacement. The print quality is great."
4,Great for home-office use.,"I bought this printer a number of years ago when I got sick of the cost of ink-jet ink. I mainly use the printer to print checks, receipts, and forms, so the lack of color isn't an issue. Linux compatibility is very good. The only downsides to this printer is that the print speed is rather slow, and it only comes with 2 MB of memory installed. If you're going to print anything with lots of pictures, you're probably going to need to install additional memory. I added 32 MB to mine shortly after I bought it, and it works like a charm."
2,"Pretty Solid, but flaky reliability","My co-worker and I started buying these Brother HL-1440 a few years ago because he had one and home and swore by its dependability. I found that about one out of every three has problems with the print drum or jamming. This is of course, for high volume government users used to creating many pages of documents. Another thing I didn't like about these HL-1440's was that whenever there are errors, the lights blink flash flash yellow/green only, and that's for all errors! It could be a damaged drum, out of paper, out of toner. And another thing, when you replace the toner, you should replace the drum that fits with the toner. Another $135! So after one toner and drum replacement you're looking at the price of a whole other printer. Do yourself a favor--get a good old dependable HP laserjet."
2,Great Printer - for about 6 months,"I debated between the HL-1440, Samsung ML1250, and an HP model (1000?). The HP was out of the running early because I found sales on the Brother and Samsung but not on the HP. I read good and bad things about both printers....I have yet to experience any problems with the HL-1440. I was concerned about paper jams, but I've had no problems at all. A great overall printer (much better than my Lexmark inkjet), especially at that sale price.*** update *** Watch out for this printer - I started experiencing gray pages after about 6 months. Brother's web site says the only way to fix the problem is by replacing the toner cartridge. This completely negates the reason for me buying a laser printer (lower cost per page) because I was no where near through the toner cartridge. For now, I am living with gray pages. I'm not sure that I will bother replacing it - might just switch to a different printer."
1,Beware,"I had to throw this printer out. It was simply too unreliable.The first unit I had streaked. After three exchanges of the printer, they finally sent me a new drum.This printed for about 4 months, and the streaks re-appeared.I have never been so aggravated by a printer and suggest extremecaution before buying."
1,Oh Brother!,"I bought this printer because it was rated highest by Consumer Reports. Like others, I experienced the grey background problem after limited pages printed. Replaced toner and experienced the problem again (and continuously) after about 100 pages. Its going in the garbage and I won't buy Brother again."
5,Excellent buy,I bought this printer in December and it's served me excellently. I've had absolutely no problems and the print quality is excellent.worth every cent!
5,Brother HL 1440,"It does what they say it will do.Easy to set up, great print quality, fast and quiet."
3,Beware of toner cartridge!,"I own a HL-1240 which is the predecessor of HL-1440. [Both almost have the same specifications and use the same toner cartridge]. I enjoyed the superb print quality for a few months (I print less than 20 pages a week) then problem emerged. A vertical line appeared on every page I printed (about half-inch away from the right edge). The problem remained even I cleaned the drum unit and wire (many times). Replaced the toner cartridge with a brand new one, problem gone.I surfed the net for solutions (don't bother with tech support, they will tell you to clean the drum unit), I found this toner problem was not unique to me. Also, because the problem emerges months after purchase, it doesn't get reflected in customer reviews and feedbacks. While the printer is features-rich and well priced, I think consumers should be aware of the quality of the toner."
1,Don't trust brother printer!,This concerns not exactly this Printer-Modell but the HL 1030 and HL 1240: I own both and have same problems with toner spread over the paper. This turns the hole Paper from white to gray. For concept-quality you can use it but not for office recommendations.Don't buy it! Take HP!
4,Solid Performer - Sturdy Construction,"I've had the printer for a few months, and have generally been pleased. It's quiet, pops out the pages quickly, and with great detail.The only problems I've had have cropped up lately--it seemed to have a problem pulling up paper from the tray, which was solved by flipping the papers around and shuffling them. Also some [apparent] software conflicts with my iMac with it hanging up during a print job--but I haven't had a computer yet that didn't have some kind of software conflict eventually. It was nice to have substantial documentation and support for Mac.There are cheaper printers out [I considered the Samsung] but I didn't think they would last as long or be as reliable as the Brother. So far so good."
1,Gray Pages and Flickering Lights,I had the same problem as many others. After about 6 months of light use the pages come out gray covered in toner. The power drain also caused serious problems. Without a UPS it pulled enough current to reboot the desktop in the same room. I've returned to HP.
2,You get what you pay for,"I researched several printers and settled on the Brother HL 1440 because of initial price and cost of replacement cartridge. After several months of very light use, it started smudging the paper. Using the cleaning procedure shown in Brother's visual instructions did not help. I have to print three pages to get a good one.My advice to those relying on these reviews is to be selective. some of the beaming reviews come from well-intentioned people who just bought the printer and have no previous experience with laser printers.I will let my level of frustration dictate when it's time to junk it and go back to HP."
1,It is awful DO NOT BUY,At first it printed well but after 6 months prepare to be dissappointed. It leaves streaks on your papers that make the printed pages look like bad copies from of copy machine. DO NOT BUY.
1,Brother HL-1440: Don't buy unless you got $$$ to burn.,"I bought Brother HL-1440 about seven months ago because some people said how good it was. It turns out to be a disaster! I am not a heavy user. My toner still has 99% of its capacity. Now I am getting vertical lines every time I print. These vertical lines will gradually disappear after about 20 pages of printing, but then come back after a few hours. I tried to clean every part I can get my hands on. I contacted Brother's customer support. They told me I need to buy a new drum/toner unit, which was almost at the same price as the printer itself. They refused to send me a new drum unit because the drum unit was consider as ""consumable"" and therefore only had six months of warranty. So, unless you have some $$$ to burn, don't buy this printer!"
3,Good priner possible failure prone,"During my first year of use this pritner was good to very good I used it for light office printing, maybe 5- 10 pages a day. At about 13 months just out of warranty it failed. Brother was unable to fix it. This was while it was still on its first toner cartridge (original one that came with it. I think it would be a fine pinter If you buy a 2 or 3 year warranty. Also the manual paper feed rarely worked but usually jammed or failed to take the paper and print to it. Maybe i should have given it 2 stars but it was a good printer for 1 year and with the way things are made today and for the price paid this is what we should expect I guess. Im going to get a Brother 5140 but im going to buy that waranty just in case. I also have had a HP 2600N color laser which after a few months of use is great but kind of slow at only 8 pages a minute or less."
5,Reliable Printer!,"I've had this printer for over a year now... actually two years now! Got it at Office Depot and it was a Consumer Reports Best Buy. So, based on that, I purchased it. It works great - all the time. I think it may have jammed once or twice since I've had it and that was probably my fault. The toner is expensive, BUT it does seem to last a long time and the printing is GREAT qualiy. We are only printing in our home office, so it's not extensive. We've had to get new toner once or twice and it runs about $80 (which I think is pricey).I'd recommend it to anyone without hesitation."
2,Jams frequently - Difficult to clear paper path,"This printer is a good value and, aside from the paper jams, works well. BUT, the paper jams are a stomach-churning hassle and have taken a lot of time to fix. The paper path can be difficult to access. Why design it this way? When I brought it in to be serviced after a series of paper jams the technician said, ""I've been seeing a lot of these lately."" I have never been able to feed an envelope through the machine successfully. TIP: when you feed in anything manually, be sure to click on ""options"" and choose ""thick paper."""
1,Gray background printing,"We purchased this printer and after just six months of light use, it told us that we needed to buy a new drum unit, which is about the same cost as buying the printer itself. Every page prints with a light gray background. It would be better to spend more money to get a better quality printer since you'll only get a few good months out of this one."
1,Noisy printing means spending $$$,"The problem with the Brother HL-1440 Laser Printer is that when the gearing goes you're only recourse is to replace the drum and toner cartridge which will cost you more than the printer is worth. Brother was smart, they made a shell of a printer that is covered, but you have to buy any important part that wears out. My HP laser keeps going and going. The Brother keeps wearing out. Brother finally agreed to replace the printer shell, but only after I replaced the drum and toner cartridge, which costs more than the printer!!!!Total cost of ownership -- terrible.I'd be embarrassed to represent this product."
1,"I agree with the ""Don't give praise too ealry"" review","I have not had this printer long enough to even go through one toner cartridge and am already getting streaked and grayed out prints. I saw this printer as a good alternative to expensive Lexmark inkjet cartridges and expensive HP laser toner. Also, I had an earlier model (300 DPI) Brother laser that worked great for 4 years. . . .beware of the low price . . .or, buy two. The first one will need to be replaced before the toner runs out."
1,Terrible,"I've had experience with two of these machines, one at work and another I later purchased for home use. Both started spewing gray streaked pages within a year of purchase. New drum costs as much as the printer. Avoid this printer."
1,Nothing but trouble,"I have bought hundreds of items from amazon.com, but this is the first that has inspired me to write a review. I bought this printer about a year and a half ago and had print quality problems with it from the start. To their credit, Brother replaced my original drum at no charge, since it was apparently bad when I bought it, and I have replaced the toner cartridge once since then, as well. The print quality has never been very good, even when the drum and cartridge were new, but it has been getting even worse over the last couple of months--the pages are now all gray, apart from the lovely vertical streaks of white that run down through the text. The drum light is not on, but even if I knew that was the problem I wouldn't replace it. I'm not buying anymore replacement items for this. I give up on this printer."
3,"Overall Good, but one question? sharing the printer","Hello¡KI just got a brother 1440 last week, it worked ok so far. However, I am having problem sharing the printer. It wouldn't let me change the setting by right click on the print icon. I have to double click on the icon. Anybody knows how to share this printer? Thanks¡K"
1,Where is it?,"Okay, the product probably rates a 5 from everything I've read. Unfortunately, I have no personal knowledge to judge this product; despite a claim of being ""in stock"" and shipping ""in 1-2 days"", its now been several weeks and I still have no printer! Its been charged to my credit card, but every day I check the status of the order & every day the delivery date keeps getting pushed back. But notice, potential buyers, that this item *STILL* says it will ship within days 2-3 days of your order. If you need this item shipped in a timely manner, perhaps you should buy it elsewhere. Beware!"
1,Request for free software package,I would like to have a free software package for my new brother HL 1440 15ppm. I have a Compaq computer that I would like the Brother HL 1440 install on.
4,Great printer,"Just got this printer and I really love it. I do not do a lot of printing, but what I have thrown at the 1440 has turned out great. It is FAST and high quality. The only downside I can see is the initial RAM amount (4 megs), but I can upgrade that if I ever run into a bottleneck down the road. Warm-up takes a few seconds and printing is a little noisy, but not bad. When in sleep mode, it is whisper quiet.Installation was easy (using a USB cable) - just run the installer and then plug it in, no problems. The only strangeness I encountered was a new service being added to my computer (XP Pro) that doesn't seem to accomplish anything. I can disable the service and print without a problem, so I'm not sure why it had to be installed and running in the first place."
1,Buying a World of Trouble,"This would be a real deal -- if only it was compatible with Windows XP, which it is not. Before you buy it, use a good search engine to find user comments, and you'll discover that (1) Brother is still negotiating with Microsoft over XP drivers, and (2) Brother's support is non-existent. Even their website is useless.Not good."
2,It works well for the original toner,"I bought this printer since that's the cheapest one on the market 3 years ago. After run out the original toner, my drum light start to flash. That means I need to change the drum as well. I do not know why the drum only works for one toner? Witheut changing both of them, I got a new printer and hopefully, it will work better than brother."
3,Consider Tech Support,"This printer arrived yesterday and I'm sending it back. It was very easy to set up and did a good job printing plain paper. I moved up to mailing labels and the first sheet jammed. I then discovered that there was no owner's manual, but a CD-ROM. After loading the CD, discovered that it was written at a kindergarten level (open cover, remove page, close cover). I tried to log onto their web site for tech support, but found that it was slow and contained little troubleshooting information. Customer support is very important to me, so I decided to send this back. I have not been impressed with Brother. This may be the best bargain out there, but be careful."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I don't know how many ghost accounts the PR department at Brother created to boost the rating of this printer but its a lot! Anyway, I've suffered the same problems as many of these other users - the printing gets spotty and grey about a year after I started using it. I was considering buying a new drum but not after I read the reviews. I don't want to waste my money. I'll look into a more realiable brand."
5,real workhorse. after 9 years running strong,"update:problems i thought i had were just a tiny piece of paper on the back roller. pulled it out. running good again.----------------been through thousands of sheets, dozens of toners and 3 drums.this thing still is a workhorsenow i am having problems paper jams. (see update above)will try to clean and fix it up.but if no go then i will buy a new brother.found piece of paper on back roller. removed it. working fine again.after all these years it is ready for pasture.it was a true workhorse.but it is still running strong so not getting rid of it yet.and besides, i have two more tht i bought and are still being used. it was cheaper to buy them on a big sale than to buy drums and toner separately.for the price quality and convenience this gave me many good years. not sure why the 1 star people are complaining. maybe they used 1 star refurb toners and drums or cheap paper that does not work well."
4,Great value...,"Of course there are faster, meaner printers out there; but, for the money, this is a pretty decent piece of equipment. It is very easy to hook up (especially if you are replacing an existing printer and already have a cable -- not included with printer). The driver practically installs itself. I was up and running in about 5 minutes. I did not purchase additional memory and find I could live without it. The printer is still much faster than my old inkjet, and the print quality is much better than I expected."
2,If you like a light gray background on all of your documents,"I purchased this astonishingly low priced printer in December of 2002. It was used casually, maybe an average of 5 printed pages a week (not much). It worked great for about a year. Then the annoying light gray background developed, which appears to be a common problem judging by all of the reviews; apparenly the drum unit is poorly designed or manufactured. It's not a big deal if you're just using it to print receipts and personal items, but the faint gray background makes it unsuitable if you need to print out a resume or anything that needs to look professional. I haven't had any other problems with it besides this one.With rebates I've seen this thing as low as $89 in recent months. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy it even for that low of a price. Spend your money on a better model or different brand."
1,Absolute junk,"After only a couple of weeks, the printer started printing streaks on the first page of a print job. Cleaning the corona wire 30 times and wiping the drum with a cloth (as suggested by technical support) did not fix it.Worst printer experience I have ever had (and I am responsible for 20 printers). Avoid."
4,inconsistent behavior,"First the good news: I've had this unit since October, and the printing is fast and clear. I'm not a really heavy user, 20 - 30 pages per week, printed from text apps. But... here comes the caveat......I've had problems with this printer suddenly refusing to print. The solution offered by the phone support worked once, and then the problems started again.After following directions on the website for Windows XP, uninstalling the driver, reinstalling, the unit is back in operation.I'll report back on how consistently it works now. Considering that XP has been the Microsoft OS on most new computers for over a year, driver problems shouldn't be coming up."
4,"For the money, you can't beat it!","In terms of bang for the buck, you can't beat it. Easy to setup in Windows 2000, slightly more challenging to setup in Windows XP since you need to go get drivers. Not a big deal. Print quality is great for home/small office use. My only complaint was the power thing. It drains electricity when it's running and causes the lights to dim in the room. Good foot-print and bottom paper feed works well. I've seen too may top feed printers jam after light use.I'd buy another Brother 1440 if I needed it."
2,Great Throw-Away Printer,What's Hot - 1.5 years effortless operation. During that time excellent printing!What's Not - Changed the drum when toner ran low - ever after - the fatal symptom of streaking and poor print quality. No support for EPS files.You wanna like it for what is does well but can't help being pissed off that it's designed to fail.
1,Attention Mac users!,"Attention Mac users! Everithing is wanderful about this printer, including the price. However, there is one little thing you should consider: THIS IS NOT A POSTSCRIPT PRINTER!!! Per Brother Solutions Center: ""...if you are using a DTP application such as QuarkExpress or Adobe Illustrator, it is often better to use a Postscript emulation driver such as the BR-Script driver that might be supplied with the printer. Please note the BR-Script printer drver will only be supplied on printers that support the Brother BR-Script."" Since brother HP-1440 does not support the BR-Script drive, be prepared to see jagged edges, poor res images, dot-matrix look when you print copy from Acrobat, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc."
1,this Brother never helped me out,"This printer is bad news. Its problems involve a horrible design that causes it to work poorly mechanically resulting in frequent paper jams. I know because I have purchased two of them. If you buy this printer and expect it to work on a regular basis for any length of time, you will be dissapointed."
5,Best Laser Printer,I've had this HL-1440 laser printer for about 1.5 years now and I've never had a issue with the printer. The printer can do massive volume print jobs without the slightest hint of smudged printout or an encounter with an unpleasant paper jam.
2,Problems,"Within one week, the printer produced a first page with toner residue all over it every time it went to print from idle. Calls to Brother were answered within 15 minutes, but the solutions did not work. The printer unit (but not toner nor drum) is being replaced by charge card hold and cross shipment.This is the first time I have had trouble with the many printers I have so soon after I bought it. I lack confidence in this manufacturer"
1,Worst printer I have ever owned,"My old HP Laserjet 4L worked for about 15 years. In fact it is still working today (I have never needed to replace the drum on it, btw). My Brother 1440 lasted 8 months.It was quite nice when it was working - fast with good quality text. But that nice quality text goes down quite a bit when your entire page is smudged and streaked. It was sometimes so bad you couldn't read the text and my printouts resembled a bad photocopy.Like many others, I will never own a ""Brother anything"" again. In fact I recently traded in this piece of junk to HP as part of HP's 2006 fall laser printer trade-in program, and got $75 towards a nice HP laser. So I guess the Brother did come in useful after all..."
2,Serious flaw,"As long as you want to print in portrait orientation this printer does a fair job. However, if you want to print in landscape mode (and who doesn't from time to time) this printer has a serious flaw. The Brother HL-1440 will not accept landscape orientation if you have any other print drivers installed on your machine. And to make matters worse the only solution offered by Brother is to remove all other print drivers (I guess Brother finds this to be an easier solution than actually fixing the software).I advise anyone who is considering this printer to carefully investigate this problem. First, check this problem out for yourself on the brother website... they at least acknowledge the problem. Second, make sure you will never need another print driver installed on your machine. If I had known about this before I purchased the Brother HL-1440 I would not have bought it."
3,Printing quality not as good as I expected,"I read a lot of reviews about how great this printer's printing quality was, so I decided to purchase it. Although the quality is OK for text, anything other than text is below average. I also own the more expensive ... and its printing quality is far better. I guess you get what you pay for..."
5,Nice printer!,"After owning a variety of inkjets, and not really needing color capability, I decided to look into a laser printer. I read several positive reviews on this printer so decided to get it.I am glad I did. It is a very nice printer. Compact, good quality, good speed, and a good value!Tom"
3,PRETTY GOOD BUT NOT PERFECT,"I have had the printer over a year now. I was very impressed by it at first.It had few jams, ran fairly fast, put out good print, and it was cheap.But the cartridge rain out fairly fast, and even worse the drum and some of the rollers seem to have worn fairly fast ( we are talking well under 5,000 prints ). Now to be fair to Brother I should point out that I have often recycled paper (turning it over to reuse as this is not a duplexing printer) and the environment is pretty dirty with lots of cat hair, dust, dirt etc.Still overall, I guess I give them the benefit of a doubt and believe it could have lasted longer under better conditions. Another thing to really compliment them on is the low price. Even if the thing did wear quickly, it was cheap, and as technology changes to fast now anyway who needs a permanent machine. I am ready to move on to a duplexing machine and will probably by a Brother again, but be much more careful in protecting it from possible contaminants."
1,Garbage product; do not buy,"When I was young, I used to work at a flea market selling cheap electronic equipment. Some new, some rebuilt. The person I worked for had no problem selling items that he knew did not work. He assumed that the person would come back and we would exchange for another one. I was never comfortable with this approach.I think that person now works for Brother. This printer has a profoundly defective design. Brother must know about it (just read these boards, or others such as at CNET). Mine was defective out of the box. Smudged print output with lines down the page. Fortunately, I purchased it at Staples so I could easily return for a full refund. I will never buy another product from Brother. I used to think that they were a reasonably reliable brand name. Not any more.My advice: for a low-end high-quality laser B&W; printer, get the HP 1012."
2,No print density control,"In general, the HL-1440 is pretty good. Easy setup... practically plug & play once I downloaded the latest driver software for Mac OS 10.2. Have printed at least 500 sheets since I bought it with nary a paper jam. Only one limitation: unlike other laser printers I have owned, the HL-1440 has no density control to make the printing darker or lighter. Mine prints very light in normal settings (and unacceptably invisible in toner saver mode). Some fonts print darker than others, so it's possible to get acceptable print density if you don't mind limiting your choice of fonts. The flip side is that because the HL-1440 is stingy with ink its toner cartridges last a long time, making it dramatically cheaper to own than competing printers. I'm finding it a capable draft printer -- 90% of my printing -- and keeping my old ink-jet printer for finished work."
5,What a gem!,"For the money, this little workhorse can't be beat! I'm an independent writer working alone and this machine pumps out everything I need, quickly, cleanly, and cost-effectively. I highly recommend it for independent workers."
2,Fine For Text,"This printer was, at the time, a decent value for printing typical text-based documents. It's biggest problem is that it doesn't print graphics well at all. For instance, a Google map is virtually useless as you can barely make out enough detail (street names, thin road lines, etc) to make it worth while. I would look elsewhere."
4,Good Printer,"This printer works really well. We do a lot of printing, and this printer has held up. We bought a high capacity toner cartridge when we bought the printer. The cartridge that came with the printer ran out of gas fairly quickly, but the high capacity one has lasted a long time. The print quality is good for the price, and we have not had any problems with ink dropping."
5,Helps with Unblock,"I find that this deck, unusual that it is not ordered in traditional ""tarot suits"", is excellent for unblocking our intuition by getting rid of our preconceptions that may come with order and language given to tarot cards. Even though I don't use this deck for divination, I have written many short proses using these cards and they are excellent tools for creative inspiration."
5,My method,The way I added meaning to these cards was by having people pick their favorite card and telling me what it meant. I've found that each person is able to tell me something about the card that I couldn't see before. I now have tenantive meanings for almost all of the cards and I find it really helpful for actually doing readings with them.
1,Sole art,"I can embrace quite a range of spiritual paths and was interested in the concept of this deck. My problem is with the ""art"" on these cards which is all so ugly and depressing. Every image is so dreary, foggy and down beat that I needed a good walk and fresh air after looking at them. I will try to give it a few more shots, but something tells me these dreadful images are going straight to the recycle bin. Most of the ""people"" look like deranged homeless people with extreme mental and hygiene problems. It sort of reminds me of ""therapy art"" for people in recovery programs or who are mentally challenged. Even the box is poorly constructed and fell apart when I unwrapped it from an enormous, wasteful ""overbox""."
2,Soul Card Review...,"Really did not care for these cards. I thought it was a book so that was my bad. But even with that the cards were not the size of regular soul collage cards (again probably my bad). The interpretation of the creator was not as creative as some of the cards that I've seen on-line through other soul collage sites. The cards themselves were rather dull. At any rate, I would not recommend them to any of my soul collage buddys."
5,Phenomenal Work !!!! ......Fisher,"I confess...I have never played a Tom Clancy game before...but I am glad I did this one ....its not mindless shooting and blowing things up like the genre of games I am used to playing like Golden Eye (N64), Night Fire or even like the legendary HALO. The stealth missions and non use of lethal force makes this game remarkable. I was mad at my brother for buying this game (thinking only HALO 2 will be worth the 50 bucks this year) but now I am glad he bought it....this is truely one of the masterpieces for X Box :)"
5,SplinterCell Stealth Masta,"I bought this game the Saturday after it came out so I got the deal(the t-shirt and demo discs).Well when i turned on my xbox on I froze looked at that opening cinematic and said:HOLY CRAP!this looks amazing.I was right.If I were u i'd vote it 5 of 5 stars because UbiSoft has worked hard in making the best lighting in the world and it turns Splinter Cell into my absolute FAVOURITE game.For Ubisoft I hope u see this message I love ur company.When im able to get a job I wanna work for Ubisoft my favourite company in the world.I have 3 reasons to to explain that:They are very nice, They make awesome games and they have a buiding near me in Montreal.Even though im in Toronto its not that long away once u think about it.I have a billion more reasons but it would take u about wat 30, 40 years to finish reading em.Well if u can forward this thing to Ubisoft I want them to know they have an Ubisoft FANATIC out here right near them."
5,The best damn video game period!,"This is the best damn video game period! You heard me, this is the best damn video game period! You heard me one more time, this is the best damn video game period! I mean, how do they make games of this quality! Finally, a game worth buying. Finally, a game that is going to keep u occupied for AT LEAST 1 year. Finally, a game named Splinter Cell, Pandora Tommorrow. Finally, a video game that earns the great award of ""The best damn video game period!"""
5,Solid Game if you have xbox live,the single player portion of this game is short but the online multiplayer is insanely fun...i suggest getting this game only if you have xbox live or system link
4,Frustratingly Addictive,"Firstly, this game is extrmemly difficult (Thanks again Tom). Despite this the gameplay is, simply put GORGEOUS(real-time shadows rock).The storyline is perhaps the most original I've ever seen(sarcasm intended)tell me if you have heard this before. A spy functioning for a classified govt. organization*stop* must save the world*stop* from a renegade terrorist*stop* who has gotten his hands on a deadly chemical weapon*stop*. Get the picture . The music certainly isn't on par with Halo or Medal of Honor(s). I wish the x-box live play was more than 4-player but in all honesty with 12 or even 8-players would have made the game too frantic but 6-players might have worked. Put these minor mistakes on Ubisoft's behalf aside however as i am distacting you from my main point. This game has done exactly what its predecesser acheived, it single-handedly has blown away the already high bar of the stealth genre and left us wanting more.Semper Fi carry on"
2,I don't really like stealth games.,I first bought this game because i heard from a friend that it was really fun and that the online play was awesome. So i went out and bought it. The thing i hated the most about it was that in some missions you can't kill the terrorists. Such as in the first lvl. Why the hell can't you kill the terrorists. If you don't they will just come back to bite you in the ass. I didn't enjoy running around and doing the same thing over and over again. Such as grabbing a terrorist by the neck and knocking him out or shooting out a light. It gets boring. After the first day of playin this i shoved it back in with the rest of my games and haven't pulled it out since. What a worthless piece of crap.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"The game was not nearly as challenging as the original. Whereas the original got me several months of play (I am not an avid gamer), I completed this one in less than a week. The missions are easy to complete and do not require you to use most of the moves/equipment in Sam's arsenal."
4,Interesting But.......,"not as good as the first. True, it may have better graphics, more gadgets, and more cool ideas(new alarm system), but the fact of the matter is that Pandora Tomorrow just isn't as good. The plot is lacking and, if you've played the first, the voices are different(Lambert and Grimsdottir). In Pandora Tomorrow you just don't feel as involved."
2,this game isnt very fun,this game isnt very fun. a few reasons. 1. you dont get to fire at your enemys sometimes. 2. not much help. poor graphics
1,OK GAME,"HARD TO CONTROL, INPOSIBLE TO REMEMBER CONTROLS, IMPOSIBLE TO BEAT THE GAME WITHOUT CHEATS. THIS GAME IS REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
3,Slow going,"Well, i bought this game because Conviction was mind blowing and a ton of fun! but this one is not the same. it is very slow passed and if you are seen by anyone you minds well give up. you might have the same amount of fun trying to sneak around your own high school if you have a ton of security."
2,"Good looking, bad playing","I probably should have rented it first because this game is horrifically difficult. I didn't play the first Splinter Cell, but bought this one after reading glowing reviews and listening to my friends who said it is the best game ever made. I've put 30+ hours into it so far and haven't gotten past the second level. I never will because I'm sick of doing the same thing over and over. My copy of this game has been earmarked for the ""Previously Played"" bin at the local game store."
2,XBox Live experience is terrible,"The game is good but the simple things ruin it for me. For instance having to re-enter the Optimatch search every time. It takes forever to find a good game. If the game is full or closed by the time you get there (it happens a lot) then you get to do the optimatch search again. If you want a good online experience try Castle Wolfinstein, it is very easy to find a good game on there. I recommend against this game for online play.The rest of the game is pretty good."
4,Extremely fun game,"Tom Clancey's Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow is probobly one of the best games that i have ever played besides, Chaos Theory and Halo 2. The graphics are great, the gameplay is awesome and best of all, it is online! Plus there is downloadable content.PRO:1.Graphics are superb2.Gameplay is awesome and fun.3.So much that you can do...4.Online5.Downloadable content6.Huge replay valueCON:1.Single player can be extremely challenging and frustrating at times.2. Controls are difficult to master.Besides the two cons that i just listed, this game is definetely worth your money!"
5,:0),LOVED ITgreat game can't get enough of splinter cell series..makes you feel like your apart of the game a job well done....very entertaining
3,"This was fun, but the first was better.","I thought this game was great, but I enjoyed the first one more. Instead of trying to find where you should go and what you should do when you get there, they have idiot proofed this one. I enjoyed the trial and error in the first one. There was much more thinking in how you should do things, a lot more brain stimulation. The second one when you walked up to a door it gave you options on what to do so there was no question if you should go that way or not. It took me a bit to beat the first game, but this one I think I beat in the first two days which makes me wish I rented it instead of bought it."
2,"good, not great","Very good graphics and sound. The problem I had with this game was that there seemed to be a VERY specific route you were meant to take throughout the game, down to every move or maneuver you made. If you strayed from the path the programmers determened was the ""correct"" one, you would be killed. The end result is being killed over and over until you figure out...was I supposed to go left or right at this part?...should I shoot this guy or pass by him?...do I open the door to the right or the left? Every decision seems to have a ""right"" decision, and it is TEDIOUS trial-and-error figuring out what the programmers had in mind for each minute detailed decision you make. You get killed, you try again, over and over until you find the one ""correct"" path. Very little, if any, freedom to move around...this game is an exercise in tedious repetition... go through the same scenarios over, and over, and over...until you stumble across the one solution. Should entertain adolescents, at best."
3,ok game,"i think it is a pretty good game and that you need to pick it up.it is not the best in the world but it is good.the best splinter cell i've played so far is chaos theory,but it is still worth getting.i like it how in this you can do the swat turn.it is very long so you wont get to bored.17 levels i think that is impressive."
1,The producer should be run over by the reindeer,"Way dumb. Cousin Mel is trashy, both how she dresses and how they have her ""accented"". Too many references to Santa not being real, causes kids to ask lots of questions. Don't waste your money."
5,I love this movie.,"This movie to me is funny and very good for kids, to me I watch it every chrismas making it traditonal to ma and hopefully to you too."
3,Movie for kids & adults,I always loved the song and this is why I bought the video. This is a cute movie and it's fun to watch. The movie goes further than the song and tells a lot more about Grandma and her relatives. It'll cheer you up and you'll probably want to watch it every Christmas. The song always makes me feel good and it was great to hear it again.
5,"""COAST 2 COAST READER"" ""KNIR""","THE AUTHOR HAS DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THIS STORY... YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF LAUGHIN, SAD, HAPPY, ETC. THE AUTHOR TAKE U ON SUCH A ROLLERCOASTER... YOU DONT KNOW WHERE YOU WILL END UP!!! CHECK IT OUT...A REALLY GOOD BOOK!KEEP DOIN YOUR THANG RAHSAAN!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I ORDERED THIS BOOK.. ON DECEMBER 16TH.. I RECEIVED IT ON DECEMBER 20TH.. AS SOON AS I GOT IT OUT MY MAIL BOX.. I BEGIN TO READ IT.. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.. THIS AUTHOR TOOK MY ON THE JOURNEY WITH HIS STORY.. I SEEN MYSELF IN EVERY SCENE.. AS IF I WAS A WITNESS TO THE STORY AS IT UNFOLDED.. ALL THE TWIST AND TURNS KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT.. I AM RECOMMENDING THIS BOOK TO ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.. I GIVE THIS BOOK 10 THUMBS UP.. WAY TO GO AUTHOR RAHSAAN ALI.. WELL DONE..
1,Waste of Money,"Pouch offers little, if any, protection and is too small for GPS if the electrical interface is attached to unit."
3,Not big enough with attachement,This fits well only without attachment on the back. Should be a bit wider to fit comfortably. I would not order again
1,Over priced and wrong product,"It was sold as a bundle with the Magellan 3050T. But, it was not even close to accepting the 3050T. It is also way over priced. For $[...], I would expect at least a ""real"" protective case/pouch (like those for digital camera) instead of a flimsy thin pouch that probably does nothing to protect any device from dropping, banging etc. Fortunately, Amazon.com has good return policy. I got prompt response and refund, including shipping charge."
5,Low Budget Protection,"This is a great little ""sock"" to protect your Magellan while it's in a purse, backpack, or other carrying case. It's sufficiently padded to protect against bumps and scratches."
1,Piece of junk!,"You have to remove the cradle, and the antenna for this to fit well. You can leave the antenna on and jam it into the case, but what a poor design. Then you have to find someplace to carry the cradle, and then put it back on when you want to use the Roadmate. I bought it and wish I had not."
3,Okay... But...,"The overall product is okay. It offers pretty good protection for the Magellan unit but I feel it should have a flap that will wrap around the edge and seal with velcro. It also does not have extra space for the anntena meaning you have streach the case around the anntena. It's obvious that the product was not ""customized"" in deatil. My wife said she thought the extra heavy insulated sock we cut and used was easier."
4,Nice protective pouch,"Nice protective pouch for the RoadMate. Thicker polyester case provides nice padding, it's not a thin carrying case at all. Small inside net pocket that probably is there to stash a SD card.One feature that would be nice, but it lacks, is a pocket for a PDA style ""tapping pen."""
2,Facts,Pouch is a bit short in length for full protection of the Magellan 700 unit. Helpful but not adequate. Another form of protection for the 700 would be best.
3,"OK, but","Yes it is a good idea to have a protective case, but it is a VERY tight fit. Expensive for what it is, probably a buck for the materials and $5 for the embroidery on it! That said, I am sure it will come in handy"
2,Magellan RoadMate Protective Pouch,"I was greatly disappointed when I got it. The pouch did not accomodate for the attachment in the back for hanging on the windsheild holder. Therefore it was an extremely tight fit, hardly fit at all. It is OK if you are not going to put the attacment on the back but if you do it is worthless."
2,Cheap,The locket looks really cheap...almost fake. I did buy it as costume jewelry for my stepdaughter...but I expected something of a higher quality...
1,A poorly-told pointless tale,"A half-dozen characters gradually join together, sort of, and an enormous amount of space is wasted on backchat, while the central action gets slighted. The only real drama comes from scenes of burned out massacred villages, as if the author must keep our interest by evoking real historical horrors, because otherwise the book's contents are so uninteresting. I like fantasy tales, but to work they require storytelling skill, a sense of action and direction which this book lacks."
1,Badly written and unoriginal,"This book was painful to read. Important events are just sketched in and force the reader to pay close attention, lest he miss something significant, but the obvious is overexplained. No new twists are added to a fairly standard tale. The reader ends up working hard to wring a story out of the text, only to find it wasn't worth the effort."
3,"Ordinary, unimaginative","I bought this book because the sequel had such an interesting cover. The sequel had recommendations by authors I liked, and I wanted another fantasy.This was disappointingly bland. The world had neither depth nor realism, nor did any of the characters. The plot is ridiculous, and no adequate explanation was later given for it. The characters are all shallow and stupid."
1,I guess the others said it first,"From what I've read by this writer, I would say this is very typical. You can read far better things online for free. Why waste your hard-earned money on this junk?"
3,A reading adventure.,"The story idea was great, but it lacked a little bit of charcter depth. For the most part, the story was interesting and I really enjoyed the ride that it took me on. I'll keep Amy Stout on my mind in the future."
3,Just Desserts,"Good movie. Love Lauren Holly. Not too long. Great to see a good wholesome movie,no violence just good fun"
2,just lame,"As a baker and former FoodTV competitor, I couldn't stop rolling my eyes during this film. It was just poorly executed. Their competition ""showpieces"" were pitiful, and pretending to almost drop them when they were obviously not even heavy was lame. Also, if there was a baking contest that paid a top prize of $250,000 and they advertised it on TV as open to any chef, there would be a LOT more than 8 teams show up! Oh yes, and what channel would air a two-day baking competition live? This could have been a cute movie if they'd taken the time to be more realistic with the details."
4,"""True love has true flavor!""","If you are in search of a little light escapism to take your mind off the stress of the day, you won't find a more fun outlet than Just Desserts. The characters are adorable, there's a great love story, and the villains are sometimes laughable.Will the boy and girl be united? Who planted the chocolate at the competition? Who does she really, really love? You won't lose any sleep pondering the answers to these questions, but you will have a very good time on the way.There's also enough tension generated with the secondary characters' story to keep the whole family watching this old-fashioned, frothy romance!"
4,Predictable but Relaxing,"This was a very enjoyable film to set and watch. You know what is going to take place in any given moment, but you can relax and enjoy and feel good about it. Something to set down and unwind to. By today's standards it is a family film. Well worth a look at."
5,Video Review,"This film is very enjoyable, a simple plot by a film to be enjoyed when you need a no brainer."
4,First book I read by Leib and I am impressed,"This is a very good story and I spent about full time reading it until I was done. Cobra is the main character, a long distance shooter/assasin, but a good interesting fellow. I enjoyed the tie in to JFK and the life of Cobra (I would have loved more details, at least another 100+ pages more). Tolliver is the other main character and a man of problem that makes it to the White House. The only thing I did not care for was the book's layout, it started in 1963 for a few chapters than jumped to 1999 and while going to 2000+ it interspersed chapters filling in some of the years between. I like more sequential stories, but it still was very good and I highly recommend it."
5,Great Quality,"What a great cartridge! Save money, better quality than the HP, more pages. I'm a convert!"
1,Never again Rhinotek,"Bought 2 of them 3 months ago. Popped in HP 950 this weekend. Nothing printing. Opened another one, popped in, the same story. Cartridges did not align, cleaning heads did not help. Soon I have found out it carries only 30 day warranty. Ink dried out, I guessed. Shaking vigorously and wiping ink outlets with damp toilet paper made it print, two rows of letters ok, the third one pale. Repeating shaking and wiping then printing 10 dense pages made the cartridge usable, though not perfect. And all of that to save 8 bucks? Never again. I will stick to HP brand."
5,Sunday School helper,"What an amazing book! My friend had a copy from her father, a minister. It's a wonderful simple book to use to teach about God. It's really adaptable to use for Sunday school."
3,"Lots of Sex, No Soul In This ""Love"" Story...","The beginning of this book was VERY promising.. it had moments where I actually laughed out loud and couldn't wait to get into it.... then as story slowly unfolded, it just went downhill... to fall further down, where I just ended up spending the whole time frowning.... and I had to force myself to actually finish.The hero is just unlikeable, in fact, he never redeemed himself in my eye. I couldnt see WHY the heroine was so in love with him. Then we have the heroine who in the beginning seemed like a quirky, sensible, intelligent woman... but somehow turns into a totally different character, a clingy, spineless, doormat. What happened to that strong woman I met in first chapter? Who knows?!With two characters like these, who would care what happens....Expect to see plenty of sex scenes with strong sexual language... However, if you wanted a raunchy, steamy romance with a heart, this isn't it.This is why I felt this story only deserved 3 stars."
1,Ashamed of myself for reading this...,"I'll admit that I usually like my romance novels to be steamy. I felt the sex scenes in this book however were positively vulgar in some ways. It almost felt the sexual encounters were written by a man, no emotional connections, just the man telling the woman what to do to please him. If you want ROMANCE and not just sex then I suggest you read something by Julia Quinn or Laura Kinsale. I thought maybe it was just one poorly written book, so I read two others by the same author and couldn't finish either of them. Stay away from Cheryl Holt!!"
2,tale of two heroines,"This is my first book by Holt - and probably the last. The book started out so promising with a strong heroine. Emma was a hoot the way she stood her ground and overwhelmed John and Ian. The dialog was sharp and humorous. However...something happened...maybe she was replaced by a twin. Her character turned into a weakling with a muddled mind. The author made her so sharp and intelligent in the first half and a sex-weakened puddle in the latter part of the book. Just a finger (if you read the book you know what I mean) and she's mush. Ugh. Please, Ms. Holt, be consistant with your heroines and keep them strong and sharp."
3,Mediocre at best,"Oden begins by dismissing all modern commentaries (anything post-Reformation) as unworthy of his attention. This leaves him with his own ideas mixed in with a few quotes from the ""classics"".He does manage to squeeze a few helpful insights out of the text. The commentary is neatly arranged according to concept rather than verse-by-verse exegesis. Oden makes a somewhat compelling case for Pauline authorship.Yet, he repeats his main ideas excessively. His wording is at times archaic and his syntax convoluted. I had to read many sentences over again to get what he was saying (and they weren't any better the second time through)."
3,Auto Ventshade 94434,"This deflectors has an excellent quality, but poor functionality, they are not preventing wind.The reason I bought them is to prevent cross-wind flow in the salon and reduce outer noise.Even after I installed all four deflectors I didn't achieve any result."
1,Poorly put together,This video was very poorly put together. I couldn't take more than a few minutes of it before I fell asleep.
1,Warning: Not what it sounds like..Christian fundamentalist film!,I didnt expect this to be a christain fundamentalist film.. watched it for fun but in the end its not what i expected it to be. I guess we are in the age of Deceit! ( If i had read the reviews which are not available on my roku i could have found it out) .
1,Promotes Fear.,"If a Christian wants to share the teachings of Christ, let him not manipulate through media images and quotes to try and pursuade the innocent viewer into fearing evil, but rather looking deeper into oneself to allow Christ consiousness to shine through. This movie is rather poisonous and causes fear. Fear keeps Christ consciousness from flowing freely. I do believe there is a conspiracy, such as new world order. Thrive, however, is much more valuable in this sense, and certainly much more uplifting particularly with the suggestions for a more peaceful world shown at the end of the film."
1,Religious propganda.,"More religious propaganda, disguised and presented as evidence, (which is twisted & bent to amazing extremes) in a documentary format."
2,"All very interesting, but...","I wonder if the person who made this film really wanted to get his views across? If he did, I can't imagine why the entire thing was plagued with a sound-track that was at times louder than the dialogue? And why the small screen images?If you have something of great import to convey, which I think this film does, you might want your viewers to be able to see and hear the material you are offering for consideration. Just a suggestion.The intrusive soundtrack, and gimmicky presentation, will likely ruin what would have been a valuable learning experience for a great many people: people who will assume a low credibility of the film because of its noise and lack of visual clarity, and turn it off after the first fifteen minutes."
5,"real knowledge, not false rhetoric","""Well done, my good and faithful servant""This is so needed in a time when both the church and the world stands on a precipise ..could be a good one and could be a bad one. Depending on WHO OR WHAT YOU SERVE!Watch it and pray, it may save you and your families life. Remember whatever ""beings"" the world and its leaders are talking to, do not have our best interests at heart ..they are coming to destroy ""all"" that God called. ""good"""
5,easy to apply,Test fit first to make sure the final fit is not crooked. The fit was perfect for my vehicle and application was a breeze.
5,Long awaited,I owned my vehicle since 2004 and wanted the shields but for some reason never bought them at the dealer. One reason was they were too costly. One day I found these on Amazon and was amazed at the cost and they were the same brand as I saw on the dealer vehicles. I am glad I found these. They are great and were very easy to install.
2,Oh Well!,"This product works but is not what I ordered.I ordered an in-channel vent and got an adhesive appliqué, but since we needed it for our trip and didn't have time to wait for a new one we went with it."
3,Intricate with Good Detail,This Chinese cork carving provides a very beautiful landscape that is a complement to most office or home settings. It was a bit smaller than I expected but the carving is done out of soft wood and has good detail. The whole scene is set in a glass case that is removable. While the wood scene looks great the display case seems rather cheap with small areas of stain/paint overlapping onto the glass. These areas of overlap are not highly visible but they are annoying. Another problem I had was that one of the glass panels on the side had a small crack. I did not notice this when I first inspected the item after receiving it but the recipient of the sculpture noticed it after she put it in her office. Overall this is a good deal for the money just make sure you inspect the item after receiving it.
4,"Very good, although I think he made better ones later","A very good CD, although I think Brian made some better ones later. It does feature a good cover of ""Save the Best For Last"", and ""Come To Me"" is a very good up-tempo song, but no others really stand out. That's not bad because it's a very good start-to-finish listen."
2,"Made while The Wiggles were on tour, and it shows","Whoever wrote, directed, and especially edited this DVD really forgot the roots of The Wiggles - in early childhood education. Each song is introduced by The Wiggles, but before the song begins, there is a long scene of Captain Feathersword and his crew. For younger viewers, it's just asking too much of their attention span, and for parents watching with them, the break in the pacing makes it frustrating to watch. It seems like they're really pushing pretty hard to make Captain Feathersword the star of this DVD. The Wiggles also seem to have less of a presence than usual - several songs are accompanied by poorly-animated caricatures of the Wiggles rather than live action, and there is much less dancing than in other Wiggles DVDs. Overall, this DVD just seems to have been made in too much of a hurry, and it does not do justice to the excellent music from the Sailing Around the World CD."
2,Bummed,"My daughter is in LOVE with the Wiggles. I was excited about the Wiggles exploring different parts of the world in this DVD, but it turns out the Wiggles are hardly in it! The main cast is Captain Feathersword and his crew."
3,"My Kids like it--I however, am not impressed",My mom got my daughter and step son this for Christmas and I specifically wanted this one because this is the concert we went to see right before Halloween. I was kinda disappointed because it was NOTHING like the skits they did at the concert and this one is all about Capt. Feathersword and his ship mates. The Wiggles are barely in this one. The Wiggles have far better videos out than this one that's for sure. You can get the Top of the Tots DVD and have a good selection of songs from this DVD on that one.
3,The Wiggles have abandoned ship,"I've had this one for many monthsBut delayed my review`Cos I kept drifting off to sleepBefore the show was throughThe Wiggles have abandoned shipThey must have writer's crampThey've made the S.S. FeatherswordNo bigger than a stampThe Captain ""travels"" round the worldand makes us twitch and groanThe Wiggles pop in now and thenAnd call this one their ownThey ""go"" to Sydney, London, GreeceAnd Sicily as wellThis ocean faring fairy taleGives off a fishy smellSan Francisco's cable carsThen on to MexicoHow they can look us in the eyeI guess we'll never knowThe set is cheap, the props are tooThe costumes a disasterWait `til you see the rainy gearYou'll roll around with laughterSome of the songs are pretty goodI wouldn't call them greatAnd when they're stuck for filler stuffThey simply animateSome older kids may like this oneThe young ones will be boredWhen I think of what they used to doThe Wiggles have me flooredAmanda Richards, January 28, 2006"
1,Very disappointed,"We were very excited that a new video was coming out, since we have watch our other Wiggles dvds until they are about worn out. My 2-year-old son loves the Wiggles. In fact, we are even going the their concert in August. This dvd was a total disappointment. We usually love to sing and dance to the songs. This dvd, however, did not have songs that children would enjoy. Most of them were completely over his head and hard to understand, even with subtitles on."
1,Sailing Out of Creativity,"This dvd was truly a disappointment. We are huge Wiggles fans around here, but this particular video is scattered, way too much talking and quite frankly, too much ""bad"" acting by the wiggley dancers.Too bad"
1,Yawn.....,"This is the most boring Wiggles video I have seen. I bought it because it received good reviews on another site. I was so dissppointed, my son was completely disinterested. He LOVES the wiggles, but he turned away and left the room when this DVD was on. He has NEVER turned away from the Wiggles before. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,"Waste of time and money--when the toddlers don't like it, you know it's bad","Our children love the Wiggles. They love to dance to their songs, and, though we find the Wiggles simplistic and staid, some of their albums and videos are, we must admit, catchy. This video, though, is definitely one in which the Wiggles are past their prime. In fact, there are more animated shorts of the Wiggles than there are shots of the Wiggles themselves. You get to see a postcard or two of the not-so-fab Four every so often in the movie. I can hear them now: hey, let's take an all-expenses paid tour around the world and get the parents to pay for it. Heck, we won't even have to play anything. No kidding. Borrow it from the library. Do not make the same mistake we did."
1,Very boring,The wiggles hardly played a role in this dvd. Captain Feather Sword and his crew were the main characters in this dvd. My kids didnt even pay attention to this dvd. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
2,Not for young Wigglers,"This is not a video for younger fans. There is a lot of dialogue and too much time between songs. We're big Wiggles fans here, but this movie isn't suitable for under 3's and parents with short attention spans. You might want to borrow this from a friend or rent it before you buy. Be sure that your child is able to sit through an hour of the Captain and his ramblings before you commit to the purchase.For anyone going to the live show, don't worry. They play a nice mix of songs, lots of old favorites and a few stand outs from this video. Even if your little one doesn't like this video, they'll still have a blast at the concert."
1,A Real Disappointment - Don't waste your money,"Our daughter is a huge Wiggles fan, and a huge fan of the Sailing Around the World CD, so imagine our dismay when we watched this DVD and realized that most of the songs on the CD are not on the DVD. Most of the DVD is ""acting"" by Captain Feathersword and his crew, and, lets face it, they were not meant to be lead characters! The acting is bad and the dialogue between songs too long and too boring. It will not hold the attention of a young child (our daughter is 22 months) or the parents who will be forced to watch it with them. I had been warned against this DVD but hoped for the best when I bought it. Don't waste your money like we did... get ""Wiggly, Wiggly World"" instead."
1,Horrible,"My son absolutely loves The Wiggles and this video he wont even watch for a couple of minutes. Where is the fun from Murray, Greg, Anthony and Jeff??"
1,Wiggles,"The Wiggles Around The World was a huge disappointment. It rarely shows the actual Wiggles, and mostly focuses on the Wiggles ""dancers"" and Captain Feathersword telling a story that is difficult, at best, to follow. When they do show the Wiggles, it is in flashback songs. Don't waste your money on this video!!!"
5,Hilarious!,"Totally bizarre premise. Will definitely appeal to those with a soft spot for art, music, civil disobedience, occupy movement, etc. Charming and unique."
4,Finally a region 1 release of this film,"Saw this at the 2010 Seattle film fest and have been waiting for a region 1 dvd or blu ray release ever since. Well, it took a couple years but I can finally watch it again :P The fact that I've checked periodically for this release for years should tell you it's worth watching."
2,classic lounge,Boring.Bobby Darin music does'nt inspire me like dallas holm or The Bee Gees.I could only tolerate about half the cd. Wish I could give it more wasted $2.00.
4,"Good, for a start","If you're interested in a wide variety of college elements, then this is the book for you. It doesn't go in-depth on any single topic, but it briefly covers almost everything related to college life.Buy this book if you're curious about college and don't mind having each and every one of your questions answered thoroughly."
1,Lame,"i'm 17 and I got this as a gift -- pretty worthless. nothing in here i didn't already know, and yeah, the dude shouldnt have made his Pro-Life opinions so obvious. he should have tried harder to be neutral. it's supposed to be for everyone going to college, not just bible thumpers."
5,Good,I really liked the characters. They were intelligent and likable. It was a quick easy read. I plan to read more of her books.
5,No Body's Perfect,"I read the book No Body's Perfect. It was written by Kimberly Kirberger. It's written about teens and struggles with their everyday life, including eating disorders, boys, and learning who to hang-out with and who not to hang-out with.This book gets points across to you, for example, ""Accepting yourself just the way you are may seem like a pretty big challenge. It may even seem impossible. But it's not."" This is one of the great quotes in this book.This book would be very helpful and influential to teenagers struggling with these problems. I recommend this book to 12- 18 year- old girls. You will love this book!"
5,Woooow!,You won't regret it! I guarantee it... in the process you'll sigh and learn on worth living things... a master piece!
5,An excellent film,"The Secret Life of Words is about a relationship that develops between a very troubled young nurse (Sarah Polley) and a patient on an oil derrick in the North Sea (Tim Robbins). Both have secret sorrows, and they slowly open up to one another. The script is excellent; the acting, superb. Even though it is in English, I suggest using the English subtitles because it is sometimes difficult to understand what is said."
3,I wish I could have liked this more,"The Secret Life of Words is a well intended film, but like good intentions, it gets derailed by its own earnestness. The film opens with a child's voice: are these words from the main character Hanna, representing the remnant of a childhood past, a fleeting ghost of safety? Or is it the inner voice, the inner words, that only Hanna can hear, since a violent and brutal war in the Balkans left her deaf? Or is this child's voice a vain attempt to make the movie deeper than it really is? I vote for the later.The acting in the film is adequate; the location, an isolated oil rig, tenuously and temporarily alive in the middle of a threatening sea, is apt. What seems to be amiss is the dialogue in the script. We just dont get the secret life of the words in this film.I would give this movie an extra half star for wanting to please."
1,"all talent, no technique","too many intonation problems to be overheard and very difficult to make out counterpoint where its excentuation is essential. do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a good recording of these magnificant pieces, however large a temptation Menuhin's talent may be"
2,Nice to pinpoint it,"With ""weird"" music, it can be very difficult to transcend ""something somebody made"" to become a ""freestanding work of art."" Deerhoof has some bizarre elements and riffs here strung together in a repetitive litany, failing to impress. To date, this is their last release that does not fly."
5,Excellent!,I bought this magazine subscription for my daughter and her husband for Christmas. I have been receiving it for years so I knew it to be an excellent culinary mag for foodies and novice cooks alike.Thank You!
4,Bang for buck,"I subscribed to this magazine because I read about it on a blog and there was a deep discount for a subscription. I had never even picked one up before. My first issue arrived a couple of days ago, and I must say that I am really enjoying it and look forward to future issues. I was a little concerned at first that there were too many ads, but the content was interesting, and the photography is beautiful.I believe that I will end up reading pretty much the entire magazine -- not flip through and put it aside. It will take several issues before I know whether I would pay full price for a subscription."
2,Really not that great for the home cook.,"I enjoy cooking a hobby, and I love using the freshest produce, fish, cheese and meats in my region. I'm not sure the magazine is helpful to those who cook at home with local ingredients. This magazine is really for the serious foodie, or industry professional."
4,A serious magazine for serious foodies,"Saveur is a serious food magazine for the person who is serious about food. Saveur focuses on the cuisine and food customs of a region and highlights a few authentic recipes from that region. The recipes include ingredients that may be unique to the region, and the ingredients may often be hard to find in your local supermarket. Saveur is not so much a ""recipe"" magazine; it is a magazine for people who enjoy reading about local food, customs, cooking techniques and ingredients. The magazine does what it does very well."
3,Saveur needs to work on customer service.,"Love this magazine. The consistent problem I have with this magazine subscription is.....they need to work on their customer satisfaction more. Have sent in several requests over the last 3 years.......several times I have received my magazine damaged due to the shipping process and moisture from weather. Why do other magazines protect their mailed out issues to customers with plastic sleeves or a paper protector and this magazine refuses to do the same ? At 2 times in the last 2 years, I have called to request a back issue and they simply never have them. Never. I mistakenly left last months magazine on an airplane and they don't even have an issue from last month. The customer service seems to be lacking regarding what would seem to be understandable requests. I get several magazines a month and this is the only subscription I have problems with."
3,in depth coverage on a few foods,My first copy covered a wonderfully in depth section on lamb. After that there was little to recommend it. I hope for many ideas from a cooking magazine and will hope that future issues give me more to work with.
1,"Food writing is overly pretentious, obtuse, and irritating","The magazine is run by food snobs who prefer complication and pretension over good quality non-frilly food. If they were a restaurant, I'd doubt they'd ever get their Michelin star.Secondly, their publisher is a very unkind dowdy person who has watched 'The Devil Wears Prada' far too many times for her own good."
5,I love this mag!,"One of the most mouth watering cookery magazine out there...This magazine will make you want to get out of your secluded house and taste what life has to offer. It takes you to the furthest reaches of Argentina and pulls you along a meander through a farm in Greece. Great stories, great pictures, and great recipes. There is no doubt that this is a fantastic magazine."
2,Try Intermezzo instead.,"I subscribe to several magazines--Bon Appetit, (ex-Gourmet), Intermezzo and Saveur. Saveur is lovely but there is a disconnect in its new direction---it used to be lovely and sophisticated (almost too sophisticated), now trying to be more hip and geared toward quick weeknight meals (like on their website), which is what I want from Bon Appetit, not Saveur! I like the simple yet sophisticated recipes in Intermezzo best, plus their travel and wine features are better than anyone else's."
4,Every issue is chock full!,My subscription to this magazine had expired over a year ago and I was paying cover price every time a new issue would hit the stand becuase it seemed like one not to be missed. A great title at a terrific price. Whether you love to cook or just love food this is a foodies dream mag!!
5,Exactly what I was looking for,This was just the book I was looking for: it is nice to browse through or to look up a foreign phrase or word--love the pronunciation helps and the nice layout.
1,Fear the rip off....,"I normally hate people who do this...but i'm pi**ed off. I just ordered this CD ,my 23 rd BOC album. Kinda completed the collection i thought. However , now i read in the reviews here (no reviews,on amazon.co.uk. Where i ordered it from), that i actually bought the music contained here 4 years ago. If you don't have it ,you need, 'Long Days Night', you don't need this . 1 star."
1,A completely unnecessary album,"Being a big BOC fan I thought I had hit the jackpot when I saw this album for sale and ended up buying it along with ""A Long Day's Night"", thinking I was going to get what was advertised:extended versions of certain songs. WRONG! It turns out the ""extended versions"" are 10 of the 13 songs on the live album ""A Long Day's Night""!!(can you say ""rip-off""?)So,as a warning to all fans, I say ""just buy the live album and shun this worthless piece of shishkabob""."
3,A good album...but...,"This is pretty much the exact same album as ""A Long Days Night"", the live album that was released about two years ago. Though the tunes are great in this one, you're kind of missing out on the packaging of Long Days Night. The value price of the CD is nice though. The CD makes no reference to the dates recorded, nor does it make any reference to the fact that it's already a published CD. The picture on the front of the CD isn't quite accurate either, as the band has gone through lineup changes several times over the years. Bottom line: cheap, good music, but there's a better version of this CD out there."
5,Celly Cel is a Westcoast Legend,"This DVD is one of the best DVD's ever put together by a rapper. It is a great collection of footage from the beginning of his career to where he is at now. The DVD has everything from radio interviews, live concert footage, autograph signings, hip hop breezies, mtv superbowl special and appearances from some of the biggest rappers, athletes and actors including: Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, The Outlawz, Yukmouth, E-40, B-Legit, Jamie Foxx, Cuba Gooding Jr., Baby Bash, Joey Porter, Mack 10, Daz Dillenger and more! A must have for any true westcoast rap fan."
2,Bad Purchase!,"Seller was poor at communicating. Didn't respond to message's both voicemail and email.Product sent was not what was requested or purchased. Actual ring was of lessor quality and value and sapphire was a darker blue than shown.Very dissapointed with purchase and extremely annoyed that I am now out of pocket approximately $400 NZD dollars in tax, duty and freight costs for receiving an incorrect product from one of your merchants.This will affect decisions to purchase through Amazon again."
5,Be aware,"This is a great book that any Christian should read. Be aware that who ever put it into Kindle form did a really poor job.. There are many pages where the spaces between words has been removed such as ; ""there was a timewhen I thought"". Unfortunately this is through out the book. There are some pages where the formatting code is showing as well. This will make the reading a little difficult, but well worth the effort."
1,Strictly a NO-star movie !,"I have 3 words for those who are thinking of buying this movie: save your money!Justine Bateman, who was so good and so cute as Mallory Keaton in ""Family Ties"" made a bad choice when she agreed to star in this bomb. It is badly written, amateurishly directed, choppy and disconnected. It goes from slow all the way to boring! The plot is thin, the dialogue worse.Andrew McCarthy has almost a bit part in this waste of film, as Bateman's husband. Actually, he provides the best single scene in the whole sloppy thing, when Bateman dreams that her husband (McCarthy) is trying to kill her. He is fully menacing and intense, and this is the only good scene to be found anywhere in this nonsense.The beginning is not so good, the ending is predictable and, well - boring!I repeat: Save your money."
5,Loser Anthems is amazing,"This CD really makes the difference for me. Being a huge mg fan, i had to have it. Got it off Ebay as a gift. was worth the fifty bucks, and it really can speak to me. Man from Harold Wood is a deep song, though i think some people dont see it that way. Just love it :)"
5,And EP that's better than most LPs,"Isn't it sad that MGB's EP has songs that are better than almost every other band's LPs? It is just pathetic. I mean, tracks cut from some of their cds sound too good to be on most band's cds.This EP holds some of the best songs I have ever heard. Flashdance II is brilliant! Just a nice classic MGB rock song. The Fine Art Of Falling Apart did not quite grasp me at first listen, though after listening to it more, I can say that it is simply incredible! And... the best track on the cd, Flight Recorder... I cannot describe how beautiful this song is. I was just completely shocked the first time i heard it. And i still get in a trance every time i hear it. Very errie and slow, but it is just fantastic."
3,Not Matthew Good Band's best,I bought this cd and I was excited bacause of it's limited availabilty. But the cd itself is not that great. The band even apologises for the quality on the inside cover. I'll give it 3 stars just because it's mgb and it's still listenable.
1,would not purchase shoes on line,did not like the shoes they were not in the best look.the suede looked like dingy. 2 days to take money out ofthe account. but it has been 1 month and I still have notgotton my refund
1,Not worth it,"I make frozen drinks 3 or 4 times a week. After about a month, I was mixing up a frozen SlimFast when it started leaking all over. The blade assembly had chips missing from the plastic and the blender is now unusable. Total waste of money."
1,Works great...for a while.,"First off, I will say this is one of the few I've owned whose motor lasted. Nice job, villaware.The reason it only gets one star is simple. The nut holding the lateral cog (this cog spins the blade assembly in the container) to the motor arbor stripped on mine after about 3 years. For some reason, this .03 cent part - unavailable at home centers or from their customer service department - has relegated my machine to a 7 lb. paperweight. This cheap nut, which is unattainable but could easily have been a standard issue, easily replaceable part, means I need to buy a whole new machine. To me, $49.95 is a tad high for a nut."
4,I'm a little dismayed,"Everyone seems to be having a good ol' laugh at this (reputedly) fine woman's expense. I'm appalled. NOBODY sings the Beatles like Mrs. Miller, not even the Beatles themselves. Her vocal chops are honed, she's got the look, plus, judging from the cover, she can BAKE! (They did make her head look strangely large on the CD cover, but in real life it was well-proportioned and quite fetching.) I'll bet that in addition to her vocal stylings and great interpretive skills, she would be a great person to hang out with. I deduct one star for poor liner notes and the omission of her spectacular cover of ""In the Year 2525"" Now, if only someone will get around to releasing her concept album on compact disc."
3,"At last, a pop compilation equal to Florence Foster Jenkins","For way too long, we have not had a crossover in the pop culture to compare with Florence Foster Jenkins, and Darlene Edwards. But now this triad is complete. A miracle of dusty vaults has returned to CDland, making all of us joyous in extremis. Mrs. Miller brings the same elan and joy of singing to the popular genre that FFJ brought to classical concerts. This is a must for every would-be karoke fanatic. It even compares to the imcomporable Faust trio on the reverse of the FFJ CD/LP. Away with technique, away with precision: true joy in performing is all that matters to the true artiste. Even Rise Stevens singing pop standards cannot match the excellence put forth on this tangle of versimiltude. Buy it now, before the Boston censors act!"
1,Do not buy this CD for the love of god.,"What a stink fest! I can't believe the other reviewers! This is not only way ""off beat"" and ""makes cats howl"" but is just outright terrible. People who think that this terrible timing, warbling singer are ""funny"" are clearly sniffing glue. I threw this one in the trash and can't believe how many other reviewers haven't done the same. I think this recording was done as a joke, thinking no one would ever purchase it because it is just so darned BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Yoooowwwwlll-O submarine,"THis reminds me of listening to siamese (yes they are cute but they have very little musical potentional which if you rearange it (potential) spells ""Lipton Tea"" i swear it's true) yowl an eardrum blasting redition of Le Miserabe( a french author,curse his lack of soul,is making a sequal to in which many dead characters miracously are resserectedand and is just generally bad) I'll be frank(nah I think I'll be Robert or maybe Greg) anyway it 's only use is as a means of torture DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRUMSTANCES EVEN IF YOU ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE TRUST DEATH WOULD BE BETTER THAN LISTENING TO THIS!"
1,What a farce!,"Thank God I didn't waste any money on this, listening to samples was bad enough! Even if I was drunk out of my face or dropped acid this would sound awful beyond belief! Let's hope any money made off this goes to a well-deserving charity!"
5,this CD always puts me in a great mood!,"The first time I listened to this CD I laughed so hard I almost peed my pants, it's wonderful. Here is a woman who tried so hard to share herself with the world. She sang her heart out, even on a USO tour. But she really can't sing, especially not the 60s chart-toppers that she tries to cover. When singing ""Downtown"", she seems to totally forget the tune and rhythm at one point, and the backup singers start singing ""Down - town"" before her, and she has to jump in late, laughing. It's like listening to great aunt ethel singing in the shower. I've had some friends question why I would purchase a CD that sounds like a compilation from the song booth at a Six Flags Theme Park, but it puts me in a good mood and gives me a really good laugh whenever I listen to it. Absolutely worth the money."
5,GUARANTEED TO CREATE HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER!!!!!!!!!!,"This is absolutely HYSTERICAL!!! There is NO ONE QUITE LIKE Mrs. Miller!!! Sneak this into the background music at your next party & the conversations will stop DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS as your guests overhear the one & only Mrs. Miller singing 'The Shadow of Your Smile'!!! They will at first wonder if it is a wounded animal or an interplanetary visitor!!! And once they realize that it is indeed HUMAN, they will double over with laughter & want to hear MORE!!! So then you can treat them to 'Downtown' (like Petula Clarke NEVER sang it!) or to the upbeat version of 'Sweet Pea' that will have your ears ringing for days!!! But her crowning glory HAS TO BE 'These Boots Are Made for Walking', sounding sort of like Nancy Sinatra during shock therapy!!! This CD is a GEM!!! You'll find NOTHING remotely like it & you will LAUGH UNCONTROLLABLY each time you listen!!!! ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!! Mrs. Miller RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Enjoyed for the most part,"Overall, a nice work, entertained me but didn't wow me. A story needs more fluidity and substance. It did have it's moments, but that's about all. She needs to take advice from new author Brian S. Pratt who wrote The Unsuspecting Mage. He keeps it flowing, and the action never dies.I will continue to read her work as it does pique my interest and several passages made me think. could do a little better though"
5,Very fast delivery,"I ordered this book, and was informed it would take 4 - 14 days to arrive. It showed up in 3. I was happy and impressed to have it sooner than expected."
5,"Lush, lyrical and vibrant conclusion to the series.","The TALES OF THE KOLMAR series is neatly wrapped up in this third installment. Elizabeth Kerner's vibrant prose and first-person perspective has made this a very enjoyable series, and the coming of age adventure is sure to appleal to a wide audience. High fantasy of the grand tradition, told by a most worthy wordsmith. Highly recommended."
3,Nothing Special,"I won't spoil anything, but Redeeming the Lost by Elizabeth Kerner is an unenthusiastic and simply written fantasy novel. The writing style is dry, and the book changes perspectives every other page. The supposed main character, Lanen, is nothing remarkable, besides being six foot and strong as a man. Every problem is this book is resolved through convenient and numerous lucky breaks. I would not read this book again, and would hesitate to recommend it. It is only decent to read only if you have absolutely nothing else. Four stars is generous, but it was better than the second book. Also, Elizabeth Kerner is an American, yet she uses the word ""bloody"" a whole lot - I don't think anyone ever said this book takes place in Britain. If you must read Redeeming the Lost, I strongly suggest checking it out at the library."
4,Good Things Don't Last Was My JAM!,"Why did all of my good cds walk? UNV...Small Change...Men at Large...I wore this cd out...especially ""Good Things Don't Last"" (ain't that the doggone truth)."
4,My first ebook - loved it!,My first experience with an ebook and was most enjoyable - good story line - loved the characters. Just wish the book was longer and the characters and story line more developed and in depth. All in all a good clean read. Will look for more work by the author.
4,Overall well wriiten,"The epilogue has some formatting issues with whole pages and paragraphs being repeated but the story itself was very good.I liked that the author brought up religious beliefs, in particular Christianity, without making it forceful or portraying it as the only viable religion."
3,Sweet,I really liked this book. It was an easy read and super cute. I really like short stories like this one.
4,Great opposites attract love story!!,"Persephone and Jason couldn't be any more different they are the total opposites attract couple.Persephone owns a herbal healing store and Jason is a big top lawyer,she views sex as something sacred and love as special,whereas he thinks of it as just an end to a means after being with someone for so long.Their relationship is fire from the beginning and throughout the story they are just trying to figure out if it's worth being with some someone different from yourself or should they quit before they are in too deep.Overall this story has great characters,a great plot,and real problems.I recommend it!"
5,Charming...,"This was my first Kindle purchase and I found the story adorable and the characters charming. An easy read with a happy ending. Ain't Love Grand? Yes, indeed it is."
2,How Christian can it be? 2 stars for a review,"To be honest, I haven't read it yet and almost didn't make the purchase all because of a review. The story sounds boy-meets-girl, flick chick storyline. But the review I read stated ""For instance, when Jason suggests that they make their relationship more intimate, she demurs. For her sex is an important step, indicating that marriage is on the horizon."" Sorry, but that isn't Biblical. Sex isn't for ""indicating marriage is on the horizon."" So my beef is really with the review at this point. How sad to think people have so gotten away from the Word of God and bought into the world's thinking that sex is a preview of marriage--which is sin. When I read the book, I'm hoping the review writer was wrong or worded his/her thought badly."
1,"badly organized, not useful for a real practitioner","I was excited to get this book, but found that it was one of the hardest to use ""practitioner guides"" I've ever laid my hands on!Practitioners need a layout that is easy to reference: before, during, and in-between sessions.Not only was the editing and layout sub-par, but the information presented was very basic, didn't give me a single new idea, and I learned nothing that I didn't know already as an NGH-certified hypnotherapist.I immediately returned this item and will not be buying another book by this author.Don't waste your time & money - there are MUCH better books out there - maybe not much on past life regression, but if you are a hypnotist/therapist, you already know how to do it - just apply the principles you know."
2,Poor production quality,"The content on this DVD is good. The problem is the DVD itself. No chapters. Looked like it was burned just in time to ship. Spotty quality. Didn't play on my PC. Played fairly well, but far from perfect, on my DVD player. Overall, a real disappointment."
2,Don't bother buying this....,This is actually more like a pamphlet. You can find the same information on the internet and not have to pay for it. Save your money for something else.
4,An Excellent Overview of Goddess Concepts Through Time,"This book is wornderful for learning about concepts of Goddesses from Prehistoric time to the Present. It is a historical overview with well researched information. The book is an anthology of experts on the subject by anthropology, religious studies, archaeology, and other fields. This is a must have book in anyone's library of Goddess information."
4,nice,the porcini and black truffle are very decent. The white didn't hold flavor or scent. The 2 have held flavor opened for 6 months.
1,micro edge easily damaged,"I used for 1 day and and it destroyed itself with a pine needle. Now I get streaks where the pine needle, or any other item I assume, has been dragged. So unless you are meticulous and clean your blades before you use them everyday and or get out of your car and clean them immediately anytime any item may fall onto your window, do not buy these. Unless you do not mind streaks. The damage is permanent, not only when the item is still on the window."
1,wore out quickly,"One would expect a name like Bosch to build products that hold up. While their power tools do, their wiper blades do not. These wiper blades wore out in a matter of months, being no better than the cheapest blades you could find at an auto parts store. I will be replacing them with another brand."
2,Disappointing,"I have one of these on my car and also a 24-inch wiper of the same type. Neither one works well. I bought Bosch because I though it's supposed to be a good brand, but in reality these wipers leave streaks as they go back and forth and just don't work all that much better than the old wipers they replaced. Get something else."
1,Bosch Micro Edge Wiper Blades,"Will never buy Bosch wiper blades again. Paid almost 50 bucks for a pair of Bosch Micro Edge wiper blades about 8 months ago, now find out they do not offer refill inserts for the blades any longer. Now you have to buy new wiper blade assemblies instead of just replacing the inserts. Rip Off."
2,Unexpected,The blade is not perfectly in touch to my accord windshield. You will see half of the watermark left when it swipe. it could be just my blade is defected.
2,Does not fit properly,"I have a 2002 Jeep liberty, and this particular wiper blade has a hard time staying on. I actually have it taped on so it will not fall off. It will not lock on with any of the attachments that are supplied with it."
1,Broke apart in my hands,"Well. I know Bosch to be one of the better brands of windshield wiper, or so I thought. This blade literally fell apart in my hands as I was putting it on. It was rediculous. Would not recommend."
1,Just awful,"I've tried these on both my 2005 subaru impreza and 2007 jeep Cherokee. Unfortunately I can't say anything positive about them. They are loud, squeaky and generally do a bad job of clearing the window. They do not inspire confidence while driving and prove to be very loud and annoying.Spend the extra money and go with the Bosch Platinum's, they are much much, much better wiper blades."
5,Wiper Blade,"Instructions were vague, but was able to install the wiper blade using one of the included adapters. Blade wipes the back window clear in the rain."
2,Streaks and more streaks,"I'm disappointed in the wipers. I bought the Bosch because I though it was a good brand, but the fact is these wipers don't work all that much better than the old ones they replaced. They leave streaks as they go back and forth and just don't work like new wipers should (and I've had them on my car for three months now). They work better when there's heavy rain, but still they're not great. I won't be buying these again."
1,Do not believe Bosch,This blade was incorrectly listed on the Amazon & Bosch web sites as being for a 2002 Ford Escape. It does not fit! The people at Bosch tech support admit that there is a mistake but will not stand behind replacing the blade. I suppose there marketing department sold another one.
2,"Product works, confusing to install and the rubber moves about 1cm.","Product works, confusing to install and the rubber moves about 1cm.Wouldn't buy this product again. Wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Not a good choice for a Jeep Wrangler - rubber residue forms on windshield,"Hi folks,I've had several sets of these windshield wiper blades for my 1997 Jeep Wrangler. The good news is that they are cheap (much cheaper on RockAuto.com than here) and work great for a few months. After less than a year however, a rubber residue begins to deposit on my Jeep's windshield. At first I thought the residue was due to my pitted original windshield but after having it recently replaced, the pitting continues.I've recently ordered the PIAA Silicone wipers to see if they're any better. Considering they're more expensive than the Bosch and have rave reviews on Amazon, I'm hoping they will live up to their ratings. I've typically had great experience with Bosch products (spark plugs, fuel pumps, even home appliances) but this just isn't one of those items.NorCalRoots"
1,Wouldn't fit no matter how hard I hit!,"The blade looked wonderful - all shiny and new - and then I tried to put it on the car!This POS is best avoided! It didn't fit because none of the adaptors were correct. I had to ""steal"" an adaptor from one of the old blades - how cheap is that?!"
3,bosch wiper?,"Ill just say this is not the quality you expect from bosch. With that said it functions fine, at least here in cali. I don't know about back east or up north a little more rain there more often."
4,this blade size is hard to find,"I have a 2007 Dodge Caliber and the back windshield wiper size is hard to find. I looked on here and found one so I thought I would try it out. It has definately held up longer then my last windshield wiper (a cheap one from Auto Zone) but considering I dont use the back wipe that much and doesnt get alot of use, I thought it would have held up a bit better but maybe it dried out from not enough use."
5,Fits Z3 M Coupe,Wasn't 100% sure it was going to fit so I took a risk. Fit the coupe perfect. Looks OEM. Win!
2,Did Not Last,"A long time ago, I bought a set of Bosch blades and they worked great and they worked well for well over year, eventually being reaplced after 2 years. Recently I bought another set (after a bad experiance with Goodyear blades) and paid a premium over other brand blades hoping for the same earlier experiance. This time they only lasted a couple of months before they started to streak. Looks like Bosch quality has taken a serious nose dive. Replaced the Bosch with Valeo GEN2 blades (at half the price) and, while I have only had them a few months, they are working great. We'll see how long last..."
1,Horrible! Streakiest wipers out of the box.,I had to remove these from 2 vehicles after less than a month of use. Worst wipers I've ever purchased.
5,Excellent wiper blade!,"Like all Bosch automotive products, this wiper blade is well designed and does its job extraordinarily well. It uses the standard hook attachment method for wiper arms, and fits snugly (installed on my '00 Accord). When researching wiper blades, I found that the newer ""mono"" style of wiper blade do not quite compare to this standard design, as the newer, more bulkier Rain-X style tend to catch the wind and thus skip spaces on the windshield. I found mine on sale at a local Autozone for $13."
2,Not a clean sweep,"My perception was Bosch was a premium wiper, the passenger side blade does not make a clean sweep on my 2010 Acura TSX. Blades are only few weeks old maybe it is a defective part and I should return? that is a hassle for one blade plus I don't have my old blades."
5,An Important Discussion Starter,"I just discovered Michael Lerner's work within this past year, and he's quickly become a significant influence on my thinking. His reports of the alienation of life in contemporary America resonates with my own experience, and his description of Emancipatory Spirituality is compelling indeed, even to this agnostic. I'm grateful for this hopeful manifesto. Read it, and then join the national conversation about these ideas at www.spiritualprogressives.org."
1,worst ever,This is the worst tea pitcher in the world. The tea maker is ok. I got it a year ago and have replaced the pitcher 11 times at 10.99 ea online plus shipping. Its just not worth it. I will get a diferent one this time. It cracks over and over. Its horrible. Don't get it. It's not worth it.
2,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE,"this tea maker does make good tea but I put my pots in the dishwasher and they warped, now I have a tea maker and no other pot will fit it. I miss my old one."
2,Leaks everywhere!,"I had an iced tea maker years ago, but never replaced it until recently. The first one I had was great and we actually wore it out. So wehn I bought this one, I assumed it would be about the same. It worked fine until the third time I used it. I came into the kitchen to find tea EVERYWHERE! I thought that maybe I had not lined it up properly. Not true. I am extra cautious to line it up exactly as it should be and still I have had 2 more times that the tea was everywhere. I can no longer use this while unattended. Sometimes it will work fine, other times it will work fine until the last half of the cycle and even other times it will be completely done just emptying the basket and it will begin to spill. I am glad that I did not pay a great deal for this. I will definitely be looking for another model!"
2,Very disappointed,"This worked good for a while. But mine now leaks all over counter even though I have it lined up and pushed all the way in for it to receive the brewed tea. To the trash it went this evening, I am tired of cleaning up tea from my counters!"
5,WHO Loves Ya Baby,"Brilliant video (per usual, it IS the Doctor, after all), awesome seller. I'd tell everyone to buy the two halves of the season separately, as it ends up being much cheaper, but then there would be fewer used DVDs to go around for me!"
2,Totally Disappointed,"I am an avid Dr. Who fan. I usually do not write reviews of anything but I really need to air out my disappointment in this set. Matt Smith is great as the Doctor, I will not take that away from him. He is not the problem the writing is. The only bright point is of course the last episode with the Silence.""The Girl Who Waited"" is the absolute worst episode I have ever seen, ""The Space Museum"" had that title now well this episode does. I think that ruined the whole experience for me. The River Song arc was inventive.The Cybermen episode was just boring-These are one of Dr. Who's most hated and evil villains! They deserve so much more respect...Shame on the writers! (You know who you are!!!)I will not bore you anymore. Please think twice about purchasing this. See it on TV or just download to your wireless device.I sincerely hope Season 7 Rocks! Bring on the Daleks!!!!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I own some Tom Baker episodes and every season 1-5 as well as 6.1. This is the first set I will NOT purchase! I found it very disappointing. The Girl Who Waited is literally painful to watch! While there are some interesting convoluted plot lines in River Songs character, I have been sorry to see her turned into something that resembles a cartoon character. Think back to her first appearance in Season 4 with David Tennant in the Silence of the Library. It was so well done--fascinating and portrayed as a character with a lot of interest and class. What happened? The whole overall tone has changed. It seems like in almost every episode the whole gist is that the Doctor ""will die"". I hope that the writing goes back to the caliper of seasons 1-4 and some of 5."
5,"Part II of Series 6 is Worth It, Part I is Not","Series 6 was televised in two parts and several months apart and fan reaction to Series 6 Part I was not good and such changes were made that it's like night and day between the two. I can only recommend Part II of Series 6 as Part I of this series, in my humble opinion, should be destroyed it was literally that bad as it was unfathomable, with listless acting and the stories (what could be comprehended) was extremely boring, but Part II really turned things around so this set is worth the money but the combined set and/or Part I is not."
1,dull boring stupid,"The whole 6th season is bad but the last three episodes are very bad. The hotel is stupid, the cybermen are an old and tired thing. And the whole dead doctor Amy had a daughter stuff ... I was actually hopeful that the Doctor would die and end my suffering. Do not waste your money."
1,Not happy with the color!,"Although the quality of the matts was what we expected, the color was not!! They certainly are not the nice bright blue shown in the picture, but are a very dark navy blue...almost black. We bought them because we liked the color with our new truck, so we were disappointed. Still, not worth the hassle of sending them back."
4,Consider This From a Non-Psychologist,"I have a read a few introductions to Jungian psychology and they have all suffered from one serious defect. Namely, in their attempt to be understood, they didn't provide a sense of the expanse of Jungian psychological thought. This book is the sole exception. It seems to be quite thorough.Apparently, some readers have found this work difficult. I didn't and I am not a psychologist. In fact, I read this work as a beach book while on vacation. I found it to be a helpful explanation and introduction."
1,"A verbose, convoluted, pretentious intro to Jungian psych","While Dr. Whitmont has some very good ideas to communicate in _The Symbolic Quest_, his presentation is so convoluted and pretentious that his reader must hack through jungles of pompous wordiness and sift through convoluted sentences in order to uncover the concepts Whitmont is addressing. For example, can anyone tell me what is being communicated in this sentence from page 141?""Active thinking submits representations to a deliberate act of rational judgment and to a deliberate order or sequence wherby that which seems of necessity to follow a given event is regarded as being caused by that event.""Whitmont should be more concerned with communicating ideas effectively and effeciently than he appears to be with constructing mutant sentences which require translation from english into english."
5,This is the perfect mothers day gift!,This is my 2nd watch that i have bought from Chelsea Watch on amazon.com. They have excellent service! Extremely fast shipping within a few days i got both watches! This price you can't beat! It is so nice! Much more prettier than the picture!Make your mom happy and buy one for yourself it is worth it!
1,Be Careful!,"This game was far too short. I finished this on the easy level in about eight and a half hours. I did not find the environments/fights to be exciting enough. Although based somewhat on the movie, I had hoped it would have encompassed more of the Fantastic Four/Marvel Universe. After playing the game Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was superb, I had high standards; this game did not come close to meeting those standards."
3,I just don't know...,"Ok so admittedly, Martha Wash is a Diva. This we all know. Another thing we know is that Hex Hector is a God when it comes to remixing. So what happened here? I love the beats in the Hex remixes but something about this song just irritates me. I think it might be the African tribal sounding part in the middle of the song - it just doesn't fit. I do not hate the song by any means. But I can't tell if I like it either. I can see it doing well on the charts but it's not going to stick in anyone's mind as one of Martha's better tracks."
5,I scored a 100 on the Postal Exam!,"I will recommend this book highly. I purchased it, followed its stategies and did all the practice examinations. I have just received my Postal Service ""Notice of Rating."" My rating: 100.00. Now if that isn't testimonial I don't know what is. I must share that the actual Postal testing session I participated in had about 60 people. After the exam, EVERYONE claimed to have finished about 1/2 of the first 2 sections. I completed 92/95 and 85/88 questions on each section. Frankly, I blew this test away. Buy this book and good luck to you."
4,A slice of little known history,"As a proud daughter of immigrant parents from China, I was thrilled to see this excellent short film. It helps that my brother, Jack Ong stars in it!All the actors in this show so much genuine emotion over this subject of shame for some families. My own parents did not have ""paper names"", butI married into a family who did have although there was no shame with them. Thank you to both sets of parents for the sacrifices you made so thatI could be born an American!Glenna Lee"
5,More To The Story,"This is a great introduction to an ecclectic powerhouse band...It's got country, country-rock, New Wave, 'rock n roll', worship songs (yes, you heard right. WORSHIP SONGS! Most notably are ""Sanctuary"" ""Soon"" and ""The Pool"")It's got songs that speak comfort and peace to you in times of turmoil... ""Sanctuary"", from their Vox Humana album.It's got biting satire as well, such as (like I mentioned before) could be appreciated by even National Public Radio. (NPR, care to give these guys a whirl?)Their music over the years has been quite the diverse kind.Fans of the Beatles, Talking Heads, Steve Taylor, The Fall, Eagles, Farrell and Farrell (Yes, you heard right) and other related artists would fully appreciate the diverse music on this one.For all you BOOKWORMS out there, fans of William Blake would definitely like the poetic pose and imagry used by lead singer Terry Scott Talor. Especially seeing that on their ""Vox Humana"" cd, they have a tribute done for the poet/mystic!"
1,Rehashed,"Very little in this book is original. Even the title is borrowed from ""Inside Chinese Organizations"" written earlier by Kai-Alexander Schlevogt (a sound empirical study)! The style, emphasis and content is very similar to ""New Asian Emperors"" by George Haley and Chin Tiong Tan (a much better written book with a more complex grasp of the terrain of Chinese management).The author does tackle some concepts such as ""face"" etc., but these provide very little insights for any but the most extreme novices.Disappointing."
1,Rehashed insights,"Disappointingly, this book covers tired old terrain -- treat the Chinese with ""respect"", take a long-term view, etc. The history and culture are covered better in ""New Asian Emperors"" as is the strategic decision-making; the business environment by ""The Chinese"". For negotiating with the Chinese, I strongly recommend ""Asian Mind Games"" over anything in this book."
4,A Great Intro to China Business,"I see that several readers have panned this one... it may very well be some old info, as pointed out by some apparently ""old China hands""... but don't rush to judgement... there are many of us who are just getting started there.I picked up the book in the Hong Kong airport on my way into China for the first time, on business.It was a treasure on that trip. First of all, it is not too heavy. Much more importantly, readers can get a great overview of what they might be facing. Mir-Ching Jen grew up and studied in China, including classic Confucius and other studies. This may make him almost unique in the ranks of ""about China"" books. some of his insight is very helpful... the book reads well the 2nd and third time.If you are looking for a first pass intro, get this book. Then, as we all have and will, continue to get and read more. There is no one (or two) books that will cover it all for any of us. This is a great start."
2,Only the Basics,"We purchased the GoLive software because it promised to do ""everything"" we could possibly want for our business website ... we purchased the GoLive book because we needed help figuring out how to make this non-user-friendly software fufill its promises. The book only covers the simplest of web designs and does NOT go into detail regarding anything that we require. We were very disappointed. I would only recommend this book or software to those who want a very simple, very generic website."
5,Love Hina 13,"This is a very good volume of the wonderful Love Hina series. Many action packed events, lots of high suspence, a new hair do, and the resolution for the feelings of Motoko and Su, on how they feel about Keitaro. A great cliffhanger leaves you wanting the next volume, but keep in mind that the next one is the grand finale of the series. Too all you loyal fans, you will not be dissapointed (except for the new hair style)."
4,Excellent writing,"I idly picked up this book expecting it to be a member of the disgusting clan of ""Thirteen dimension string theory in a week for the totally clueless."" Instead it is a fascinating overview of biological science, complete with humor, history and wonderful imagery. It makes you wonder why biology is not one of the hottest conversation topics around, once you begin to appreciate the complexity of living organisms. It contains more facts than the average popular science book and is wonderfully written. While you're reading this one, check out his ""Life Itself,"" which goes into great and fascinating detail on the cell."
4,Excellent intro that makes biology seem like a real science,"I majored in Physics so all other sciences seem like also-rans to me. Chemistry is a sort of trade-school subject and bio is just an exercise in labeling things. Or so I thought. This book starts at the molecular level and builds up to forests. Every step connects neatly with the ones before and after to show that biology is truly a scientific field, not just jars of glop. I was impressed and fascinated."
4,Basically a good book,"As an introductory book for the layman, Rensberger's Instant Biology does a more than adequate job. There is a less than expected emphasis on phylogenetics, which some will miss, and there is certainly an overemphasis on the controversial theory of evolution (which Resenberg strongly supports), but otherwise I found the book to be enjoyable, very engaging, and informative."
2,"Good Storage, Rolls Poorly","This unit is fine for storing sheet goods, but does not roll well when heavily loaded -- it takes a couple of guys to move..."
4,Good Flash for the Price,"This flash worked good with my D50 while I owned it.It puts out a decent amount of light and is reliable, especially for the lowest price of any hotshoe flashes for Nikon cameras I have seen."
4,"Cool, Old School Shoot-em-up","A side-scrolling 3rd person shooter that has elements similar to old NES games, something like a cross between Contra and Metroid, except the graphics are much more polished. This game is especially appealing to an older gamer; the game is not overly gross for younger gamers, but it isn't easy and the control scheme and map functions may be frustrating for a pre-teen player. This game is a delight for gamers who grew up with NES. The maps are complex and the bosses are not easy. The ""360-degree"" aiming system is very unique; the main stick is used for controlling the character and the C-stick is used for aiming. This bargain game is worth the price; however the Amazon price of $15 is actually higher than what you'll find at your local mega-department-store-supercenter (it's only $10 there)."
2,They Shoot LASERS!!!,"All I have to say is this is . . . an interesting game. But don't take it from me, I think Psycho Jellyfish does a much better job describing this game than I can here. http://www.psychojellyfish.com/node/50"
2,Interesting but disatisfied,"I thought this movie was somewhat good, but it was slow at some parts and the end was just a cliff hanger ( I Think). It didn't meet my expectations, but it wasn't horrible either."
5,Nice elevator...,"This is an interesting and sexy, fun movie about couples and relationships. Someone on French Amazon said it best though...no one does adultery quite like the French. Of course the best part is the cameo appearance by Johnny Depp."
2,"It's not the American Version, it's imported","I was looking to buy a textbook for my little brother to study, and I saw this book.Unfortunately, I forgot to note the ""imported"" status on it, and I figured out it was the International version of the book, not the American kind.It would have been better if the seller of this product made a note to take pictures of all sides of it. It clearly says on the back that this book is NOT for sale in the US.Also the picture does not match the book at all.A fitting quote for this book is:""This my friends is false advertising!"""
3,It's ok,The book was a requirement for class; however I would like to point out that it could provide better examples for complex problems and better details on each subject instead of summing through. One important thing...where is the complete model of the unit circle? :-/
2,Not Great,"If you want to learn advanced Algebra and Trig, this book is not a great choice. It does not explain the information well and the examples are not easy to understand."
1,Worst math textbook ever.,"The authors of this textbook (Stewart, Watson, and Redlin) have severely failed to create an understandable approach to mathematics. As soon as you start your homework in this book they will start you off with the most complicated exercise in the chapter. Unlike other textbooks which generally have some sort of progression in difficulty as you move through the homework.The authors continuously mix up concepts in the chapters. If you have learned one thing, expect a random question with concepts you have not learned.The authors assume the student knows mathematics as well as they do.The student solutions manual is a joke as well. Steps are skipped and the layout is poorly done. There will be instances where the solution is ""see Excercise 7.4.42"".I hate this book with a passion."
1,Worst book i ever used for math,This book doesnt even have a complete unit circle. I failed my math class because none of the examples make any sense. Hate it!
3,Alright but not great,"There are tons of textbooks on Precalculus like this one out there. Larson's is just another equally good textbook on the subject of calculus and Precalculus. However, I see no much uniqueness and innovations in any of the calculus books like this type. Richard Feynman, one of America's greatest physicists, once said most of the popular textbooks (on physics) were somewhat mediocre. I would recommend those who are aspired for an austere treatment of elementary mathematics, ie, pre-calculus and beginning calculus, to go for the book High-school mathematics by some Russian mathematicians. ISBN: 5030010114 This series is just so comprehensive with lucid explanations that every high school math teacher should take a look at it. It's both fun and benefitial to read books on math translated from another language."
4,Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus,"The book was great. It had no visible signs of damage, it has also very adequate methods to solve most of the equations and problems presented."
3,Text book for school,"I bought this text book for my daughter to keep at home, so she wouldn't have to lug the school copy back and forth. This used text book copy serves its purpose well and helps keep her backpack load a lot lighter. The book topic however, would never make a top ten must read list."
2,No improvement in the 6th addition,This is a very expensive edition update from the popular 5th addition and offers no real enhancements. The textbook price of $160+ is ridiculous and deal breaker for many math teacher and parents. I highly recommend staying with the 5th addition and buying from the robust used market. The web based support seems to be left up as it should be.
3,Baroque,"This is a ""classical"" math textbook, in that it presents short sections with call-out boxes, and each short section is followed by a homework review section. Great if this fits your learning style, but there are better textbooks out that approach precalculus with a bit more real-world applicability and creativity.It should be noted that there are a number of errata in the text that need to be set right; answers given for the homework sections are not always correct. It's not great percentage-wise, less than 1%, but it's irritating."
1,Not conducive to learning.,"All this book does is prove the authors are very educated, but lacks the ability to pass on the knowledge. The sections of the chapters make an attempt with examples to the reader of explanations on how to solve problems. More often than not there is a twist in the very first problem in the exercises to throw you off rather than support and reinforce the example just given. Top it off with the answer in the back without a hint of explanation. In short this book is very poor and not conducive to learning even with the support of a knowledgeable professor to back it up."
1,the worst way for trying to learn Precalculus on your own,"This textbook must not be used if one wants to catch up on the missed lecture. I tried to teach myself few chapters after missing three classes due to illness and could not understand anything. The authors of this book present most of the material in bits and parts while omitting a lot of steps. I ended up hiring tutor. THIS IS A VERY LOW QUALITY TEXT BOOK, DO NOT WASTE YOUR EFFORT"
1,BUYER BEWARE!,I bought the book packaged with access to cengagenow. The access code that came with the book is not correct. It is tied to a different book on the cengagenow website. cengagenow customer service refuses to assist. They say it's not their problem.
4,Rating for Precalculus,"The book arrived on time, which was a good thing because I had an assignment due the following day. Why i gave it four starts is because there is writing inside the book."
1,Dont expect any help,"this is by FAR the worst math text i have ever had the misfortune of being forced to use (university of new mexico). there is absolutely no explanation of principals in terms that even come close to being understandable. the only examples available for review are the most basic explanations possible and shed no light AT ALL on how to solve more elaborate problems. of course the author would make the argument that the user of this text is supposed to know the basics of the principals in the book, to which I would say, the purpose of a book is to LEARN, whether i should or shouldnt already know something is not the point. get used to seeing ""heres a problem"" and ""heres the answer"" with no explanation on how to get there. useless."
2,Not so good.,"This book is one of the worst math text that I have had the pleasure of using. The explanations are poor and I have to google the material for better examples and explanations. If it was the last available reference in a post apocalyptic earth it would work, but not effectively. With so many other quality texts on amazon choose another for one independent study. However, if you need it for class buy it, scan the HW problems, and send it back then promptly purchase another book."
4,better than what i thought...,I thought that buying books over the internet would a bad experience but I was wrong it was good experience after all. The book I purchased arrived within the date that was post and the book was in good condition. I'm going to consider buying most of my books form the internet...
1,Sent the wrong item & won't answer my e-mails to return it!,"I bought this text book for my son's college! It was the wrong book! I've tried to contact the company colony palms to return it for a refund but I still haven't heard from them! Why should they contact me; they've got my money! I will never deal with this company or amazon again! Remember their moto, ""Let the buyer be aware!!"""
1,No way to return incorrect item to individual seller.,"I ordered a precalculus book. The book that arrived was the incorrect book. There is nothing on the site that allows me to return the book to the seller, except the address (personal), have had to responce from written letter to seller, and no way to get my money refunded. Amazon can not do anything for me."
2,precalculus,"This book was bound together with duct tape, the edges were worn through so badly that the card board can be seen. Inside has names written all over, drawings, and a lot of profanity. . . good things it's just a math book and all of the problems are eligible."
4,It's acceptable,"From other PreCalculus books I've selected to read, this one is more convenient. It's not too hard, neither too easy to review and understand. I'm using this book with other resources to hopefully master this level."
2,Not what I expected.,"In the description of this book, they said there was a study CD included and this turn out not to be true. I was totally disappointed. I actually was looking forward to using that CD. Just give the actual description of the book and that will be just fine instead of saying things which ain't true."
2,An opinion,"I think this book didn't help me that much. The answers seemed to have multiple errors. I had a horrible professor (wasn't great at teaching me the subject), and the book didn't help me either. I'm typically an A,B student and I was totally lost the whole semester. If you need help with the subject this book will not help. I'm giving this book 2 stars for the fact that it may have been my professor that confused me more than the book."
1,Absolutely garbage,"A horrible math textbook to use... The author thinks you memorize everything in the previous chapters, and doesn't even show you how they got to certain points of a problem. I had to spend half an hour putting in different numbers and formulas in my calculator to get the exact answer as the one in the book, because the examples are not detailed enough. As for the exercises, the first few are exactly like the examples in the previous pages, but as you get to problem 60 or above, NONE of it was taught in the chapter. You pretty much need to rely on yourself, a tutor, or the SOLUTIONS MANUAL. I hate this textbook."
1,This ain't the onion....,"Time to ""out"" the shill... Adam V. Powell is an Onion staffer. If you somehow live in a bizarro planet where the Onion's bizarrely bad AV Club is relevant to you, then maybe this book is of importance to you. But if you have been reading the Onion for years and have always wondered ""What is this lame, sycophantic, sub-standard entertainment section called the AV Club in the back of this otherwise brilliant newspaper called the Onion?"" then this book is not for you. Much better off buying a real Onion book... Or buying this when it hits the cut-out bins in a few months.... Or simply reading free weeklies that actually have entertainment sections that have something to say... Paying money for a compilation of lame entertainment writing that 9 out of 10 Onion readers discard weekly is not a good idea..."
2,Give this cockroach a good blast of Raid.,"I expected this book to be hilarious, but it was a huge let-down.First of all, I do not like books that have an obscene word in every other sentence, as this book does. Consequently I don't recommend it for pre-teenagers.Second, the people who were interviewed for this book seem to say pretty much the same thing: ""I was right and the people who disagreed with me were wrong, so ***** them.""Third, there are many times when the author stops in the middle of a sentence, fills in ellipsis (...), then changes to a completely different thought and leaves you hanging in mid-air. This is maddening!I would demand my money back, except that this book was a Christmas gift from a close relative who should have bought me a necktie instead.Skip this book; it's not worth your time."
5,"Hook, Claw and Feeler","The latest from The Onion gang is nicely shaped and has an easy-to-scan typographic scheme. It's the kind of book you put on the coffee table.It's also the kind of book you pick up to leaf through and end up reading whole in one sitting, snapping back to reality in the depths of foggy morning with a head full of ideas about quitting your job and doing performance art.The Ian MacKaye, Joan Jett, Tom Waits, and Pam Grier interviews are highlights, but the oft-cretinous subjects surveyed are all interesting, especially as editor Stephen Thompson has grouped them. ""Why didn't I do that with my life?"" one thinks, and then a few pages later, ""aha, that's why.""A good holiday gift, and a swift kick in the eye of complacent lethargy and stratified thinking, _Tenacity_ is perfect for your crazy uncle. Even more perfect for your aunt, the psychiatrist."
4,Happy with purchase:),"This seems like a very good book so far. It shipped on time. I have had some unexplained health problems for some time now and I am on the journey to find out more about candida overgrowth and what it does to our bodies, this book is excellent guide to finding out more about the condition. It does explain the science behind the condition but in an understandable way. I am using this book and a couple other sources to cross reference my research and get to the bottom of what i am dealing with in my body and thus far this book has been the most helpful."
1,not reccomended,"based on a lie, the only people that get candida are those with extreme wasting disease"
3,Good to understand the connection.... Not good enough to fix it,"Maybe I had too many hopes when I got this. The author does a good job at explaining the connection and is probably an eureka moment for those who see the link for the first time, also good illustrations and explanation of the immune system etc. However the book does not really give you a detailed plan on how to fix this step by step - detox, diet, adding probiotics etc. Further there is no mention of stuff such as oregano oil, coconut oil, and well-known holistic options. Moreover there is no mention of stevia and instead preference is given to some harmful artificial sweetener. Maybe there has been no recent revision of the book to incorporate latest info... however I would say I found better info on websites such as [...] that give lot of options, detailed plan etc."
1,Very dated and poorly laid out,"While this book has some good information, most of which can readily be found on the internet - it is so outdated and lacking in key data (such as natural supplements to combat yeast growth) that I cannot recommend it. It's also very difficult to locate recipes with the way it's organized, very confusing. I've found a few reputable websites and was hoping to supplement my knowledge through this book however I found the information too outdated to be relevant."
4,re-release,"Thelwell's Pony Cavalcade is a re-release of his earlier books ""Angels on Horseback,"" ""A Leg at Each Corner,"" and ""Riding Academy."" The cartoons are delightful, and will be appreciated by all horsepeople."
3,Sadly disappointed . . .,"I purchased this book for my pony-crazy daughter, but am sadly disappointed. Poor quality printing makes this edition of Norman Thelwell's timeless equine drawings pale in comparison to other, earlier versions. The muddy reproductions of Thelwell's drawings blur or omit the amazing detail of the originals, which made them so memorable when I first read then as a child. I will be perusing the used-book sites for the circa 1970 editions to share with my daughter!"
3,not bad,"I bought this shirt as a gift for a nephew that just started wrestling. The shirt isn't bad, but the printing on the shirt leaves the lettering a little blurred. It's not unreadable, but since the shirt has so much text, it's a bit difficult to read."
5,Este es un excelente libro para despertar.,"Este libro tambien tiene un film llamado the peaceful way of warriior, inpirado en la historia real de Dan Millman. Depues de ver la pelicula trate de retener muchas frases que encontre en ella, de esas frases que es bueno tenerlas en mente, sobre todo si tenes disposicion a cambiar, asi que, me suscribi a la pagina de Dan Millman, y ellos sugirieron el libro en español, el cual es ,mas extenso que la pelicula. Creo que vale la pena tenerlo como un hand book que te puede acompañar a muchas partes."
3,Interesting Reading,"This novel was not so good as I expected but is an amuse story. There are a couple of advises that you could use to improve your own life, but nothing that keep you thinking all night long.I would prefer Paulo Coelho books instead. Like Fifth Mountain por THe Alquimist. Those are pretty good."
3,"Ok when used in class, but may be frustrating","This book does an alright job helping one learn with guided instruction, however, the lack of English is frustrating at first. It also has a limited reference section in the back of the book, making it difficult to find anything like specific grammar and structures. Finally, the vocabulary section in the back of the book does not necessarily include all the words you will encounter in the book."
1,Spanish Book,"Hello, this book is probably an alright book for someone who already knows some Spanish. I don't know any Spanish and needed this book for my class and it is horrible. It is completely in Spanish and has virtually no English. How am I supposed to learn with no reference to my own language?"
5,Saxon lands again!,SAXON'S ORIGINAL EAGLE HAS LANDED IS ONEOF THE GREATES LIVE ALBUMS OF ALL TIME!I ALSO LIKE THE GREATEST HITS LIVE WITHALL THE CLASSICS MAKES IT A MUST. THETHIRD LIVE IS A MUST FOR ALL NEW ANDOLD FANS. SIDE ONE WITH ALL THE CLASSICSAND SIDE TWO WITH NEWER MATERIAL SOME OFWHICH I NEVER HEARD AND I THINK IT'S JUSTAS GOOD AS THE CLASSIC MATERIAL. THIS ISFOR ANY SAXON OR HARD ROCK FAN! CLASSIC.
3,Problem poles,"I completely agree with the previous review. It's a nice little tent if you're not very tall. Two people can sleep in it but there's no room for any gear whatsoever, and the fiberglass poles split after only one season of mild use. I have found it very difficult to find poles that will fit this tent in most outfitters and have resorted to purchasing aluminum poles on-line so I can continue using the tent. Given the hassles I've had with it, if I had it to do over I'd spend more and buy a tent made by a more well-known manufacturer."
4,My favorite tent for 2 years,"This was a great tent for one or even with two sharing the load on backpack trips. It was used at least 6 times a year, and for entire weeks at a time. The design and large, well-staked tent fly is impervious to wind and rain, and the vestibules are perfect for boot storage and viewing the night sky from. Finally after much use one of the strained tent poles snapped at the top and I will look for a new pole before I will replace such a nicely designed and comfy tent. It also is fairly tall for a backpack tent and has a nice carry bag that you can fit a footprint into easily. I bought it for a small price so am not disappointed with how it performed. I sure hope I can find those aluminum poles everyone is talking about to go with this tent. That would be fantastic!"
4,For the price its great,"At 6 1/2lbs its a little heavy for a true hiking tent but overall I was very impressed. It was easy to set up spacious considering and with the rainfly attached I was kept perfectly dry all night. The dual vestibule was awesome, keeping my gear dry all night and deflecting a good deal of wind. Setup was a beeze and take down just as simple. Highly recommend this to anyone wanting a cheap semi-lightweight, very durable tent."
5,awesome product,Great product for the price.Very easy to put up.Last time we used it the temperature dropped down to 30 at night and we were fine.I like this tent a lot. It is light and doesn't a lot of space.Definitely a bang for the buck!
3,This book is an acquired taste,"If you are exploring the end of the ""Informaton Age"" and the existence/arrival of a new age (as yet unnamed) then you will enjoy this book.I read this book around the same time as I read the following books;The Dream SocietyA Whole New MindThe World is FlatLovemarksAttention EconomyIt wouldn't be the first one I'd read, but it was totally worthwhile because I was exploring and trying to assemble a big picture on how society was evolving and I wanted to gather as many opinions as I could."
5,Run them in RAID,"I run these drives in RAID like I do, the TCQ really kicks up performance! I use the Pacific Digital Talon card. Doesn't have Unix/FreeBSD drivers, but works good in Windows."
2,So malicious that it's not even funny,"Since I like computer humor, I read this book, expecting to get a lot to laugh at. I sure got some. Unfortunately, most of the book is just stupid (and partially incompetent!) ranting which is anything but funny.Reading this lampoon, I expected the author of the book to be an old frustrated jerk who sees the life passing him by and every twelve-year-old doing things he has no chance of ever learning. I was amazed to find out that Mr. Ainsley has actually been dealing a lot with computers and Internet. I wonder why he is so embittered.If your friend has the book, go ahead and take a look at it. But it's by no means worth spending money on."
2,Awful characters,"I am about halfway through this book and not sure whether I am going to be able to finish it. The writing is amazing and the historical details vivid -- but the main character is the most stupid, shallow, insipid creature I have ever come across. She leaves her faith and her people because she has fallen in love with a Christian prince. The main reason for her love seems to be that said prince has blue eyes and good legs. She loses her virginity to him after seeing him about three times, and then is shocked when he leaves her. The other characters are all stereotypes -- narrow-minded rabbis and priests, spirited, beautiful young women, and domineering wives. The latter two types of character persist despite the author's view that everyone in Renaissance Italy hated women and was comitted to subjugating them. This book IS a fast-paced page-turner, so it makes a wonderful read as long as you don't need any characters to identify with."
1,Not worth the time,"While it's evident the author did quite a bit of research in writing this book, it does not translate well to the page. She spends too much time on detail and not enough on developing these characters. I felt no connection or conviction to see where the main character goes. And I lost patience - finally giving up after 400 pages. And the Italian got annoying!"
1,"Good writing, mediocre research","The author's subject matter is fascinating. Alas, the author has no knowledge of the matter she is writing about. Her Sepharadic / Italian characters speak with Ashkenazi accents, furthermore she describes acts that are an religious abominations. The leverite marriage she describes is impossible. A brother would not and could not marry the widow of his brother if she already had children from the deceased brother! Where were her advisors? Where were her editors? The work reads well, however the author has no knowledge of the people she is writing about."
4,"A good read. Lighten up, people.","I am surprised at the number of people who have their knickers in a knot over the author's research or lack thereof, depending on who is doing the bellyaching. If you want exacting,unassailable pristine research, then read non-fiction and do it yourself. A novel is a novel. Although I am descended, on my mother's side, from the heroine/villainess of 'Grazia' I have to say I would have found it interesting anyway. It is a fun book. It loses a bit of steam toward the end and leaves some loose ends, but so what? The plot moves well and it is easy to read without being insulting."
3,My Followup to My First Review,"I felt bad discontinuing this book at 50 pages, so I read some more. It took FOREVER to finish because it was boring! It had so much to say, but redundantly made its point. I'd give it 3 stars as an overall review.Somehow I doubt that Grazia could just leave Judah and run off with Lord Pirro. Wouldn't that be fatally taboo in Christian society, and wouldn't the Jewish people sit shiva for her and take her son from her, Anna Karenina style? I also find it hard to believe that she could have sex so much throughout the book and get pregnant only once. It seems too convenient.Maybe I'll wait for Ms. Park to write more and then see if she's changed her plot structure to complement her rich writing style."
3,Well researched historical novel but a disappointing story,"The Secret Book of Grazia dei Rossi started out as a promising read. The historical and cultural information was quite accurate and the telling from a Jewish woman's point of view was refreshing. However, what started out as a intriguing story with interesting characters fell into a long series of episodes that seemed written only to display the author's research into different areas of renaissance life. I soon became bored with the characters, the story became predictable, and the tacked on epilogue was an uninspired way to tie up the ends of the story. The tediousness of the novel was not helped by the straight forward and simple prose style. The lack of artistry and depth made this novel a dull superficial read."
4,I loved looking into the lives of two Renaissance women.,"As an artist and painter who is highly influenced by Rennaisance art, I was intrigued by this book and the historical glimpses it gave into the lives of both the Jewess Grazia and the Christian Isabella. I enjoyed the ties to real historical events and people. Imagine my delight when I came across a real painting of ""Federigo Gonzaga"" (Isabella's real son who was taken hostage). The painting was done in July 1510 by Francesco Francia when Federigo was taken hostage and sent to Rome. Apparently Isabella got the painting back when she got her son back. The painting is in the permanent collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC."
3,WAY too long...,"Way too long, too soapy, bad ending. This book petered out about 2/3 of the way through and I had to force myself to finish it. I thought the historical aspect was interesting at times but the characters were not that well fleshed out and when various ones were killed off I didn't really care that much. I would not recommend this book unless you are interested in this period of history."
4,An interesting account of Jewish life during the early Renaissance,"This book is well researched and rather interesting to read. The character of Grazia, though imagined from an actual historical figure is fictional, and the depth of life created for her by the author kept me rapt. My only complaint about the book (and the reason for its four stars) is that I felt the contrivance regarding Grazia's son to fall a little flat."
1,Vinyl costume,I got this in a medium and it was huge. I usually wear a medium. It was a shiny vinyl material (I wanted a cotton or poly costume) and looked like a shapless shiny trash bag. The cap matched in vinyl and would need to be pinned on. The company that shipped this doesn't do returns for the month of October(wouldn't have ordered had I known that)so I had to exchange for something else. I did get a replacement but not in time for the event I needed it for. Probably my last online costume purchase.
2,Not at all like the picture!,"I bought this outfit for my friend in a size small because it said it fit size 4-6. It doesn't! She is a size four, sometimes a five, and it was entirely too small. Also, the picture makes the dress look as if its cotton and conservative in length, it's not. It's plastic and fell right below her backside! She's not 6ft tall either, she is 5'4"".Hoping I can get this returned as soon as possible and can get my money back!"
5,Rolling on the floor laughing,"Firts I watched the movie, then found the on-line comic strip. Now I'm a collector of the books. They keep me laughing."
5,"Try it, You'll like it.","This is a movie worth watching styled after the old Hitchcock thrillers with irony and twists. It's a Christmas gathering of family and friends who have more on their minds than making merry. Each is so involved in his own selfish and hidden agenda that tensions peak dramatically. The only one in complete control is the unexpected guest, Marcus, who captivates all with his alarming demeanor. As the drama unfolds and hidden secrets are revealed, each character is caught up in a rush of emotions accentuated by the whereabouts of missing Brooke. Marcus himself, however, has his own hidden agenda leading to the movie's dramatic conclusion. This low budget suspense thriller compiled by basically a crew of starving artists is an explosive thriller that you must see."
1,Check it out before you buy,"Suggest you use Amazon's Look Inside function (just click on the cover of the book) to read the first couple of pages. If you still think spending money on this is a good idea, then god bless you and enjoy the read! Seriously, the numerous 5-star reviews here cannot be real. This is high-school level writing. That it was published is a mystery to me."
5,Nerve racking,I was nervous for so many of the characters in these stories. I felt like I was watching the events take place on a large screen in my head. That is how good it was thought out and written. You never know what to expect to happen next. What a nail biter.
2,OK but not great UPS,"I've had problems with other brands so I decided to try a Tripp-Lite. First of all, this high end UPS does NOT support Linux well at all. Their custom software has very limited Linux support and I never got it working correctly. It uses some proprietary protocols on both the serial and USB interfaces so I wasn't able to get it to work with other standard UPS management tools in Linux.I ended up having to spend more $$$ on an SNMPWEBCARD to get adequate support with Linux.On top of that the UPS failed in very strange ways. I get it replaced under the warranty but it certainly doesn't inspire confidence in the product."
5,"""Outstanding Story Telling!!!""","Peronally, I have never read the entire book of Ms.Dawn Miller's, but my mother has and she told great concepts about Dawn's novels, and it has encouraged me to try and read the whole story again. My mother is not a big ""story reader"", but this particular novel stuck to her like glue! And she is starting to read it again.(As well as I.)I would STRONGLY encouraged you to purchase this novel or another of her's, because this particular author really touches deep into your heart.Thank you Ms.Dawn Miller!"
4,1 Star!?,"Upon hearing this album, I could not believe that someone would have the tenacity to give this album one star. Have a little lenience, sir! There's always gotta be that one guy who's adversely different from everyone else... Anyway, this is a wonderful and beautiful acoustic album. I saw this guy a few days ago in concert, and his music is just as uplifting on record as it is live."
1,Not so good,"There is no question D'Agostino is an excellent guitar player, and for this reason I gave this CD one star. However the music it self is very bland and not interesting. This is ideal ""muzac"" for elevators. I had trouble hearing the entire CD in one sitting. It just did not move me. His lattest CD, that I heard parts of on NPR's Echoes, seemed more provocative. Venus over Venice has a very main stream sound. Perhaps that is why I was disappointed with this recording. If you like fluid music with a creative edge, a la ECM lable, then this CD is not for you."
4,Good Value,Good value for the products. It is a generic battery that is included but it works fine. Very fast shipping and professionally packed and sent.
4,Daughter haunted by mother's Satan worship,"Between Heaven and Hell is a compelling story about Skyler, a young girl raised in Detroit Michigan by a mother who made a deal with the Devil. In return for fortune and fame, Skyler's mother committed numerous murders to fulfill the contract of human blood sacrifices she made with Satan.Skyler's mother traded material wealth for her daughters peace of mind. Her mother Jean, commanded Skyler to pettition Satan for his blessings shortly before her untimely death.Skyler was haunted by her mother's religion. She spent the majority of her life trapped in her shadow. Drug, sex, and money addictions caused Skyler to be confused as to what her purposein life was and wondering if she had control over it or if the pettition her mother forced her to make dominated her."
3,Disappointing,I have many Tim Janis CDs. This one didn't have any songs that really stood out. They all had a sameness about them--just more of the Tim Janis style but nothing noteworthy.
3,Not the one I thought,"Despite his name and the title of his album, this guy has nothing to do with the UK producer that worked with Shabazz The Disciple and A-Alikes. He is an american MC and producer (he produces himself all the tracks on his album), but I couldn't find much information about him."
4,Oliso TG-1000 Steam Iron,"I am a quilter and this iron at first seemed a little heavy, but the auto lift is working great. so far this iron has worked good for quilting."
4,Love it,This iron is great. I don't iron often but I love that it wont let you ruin your clothes. It runs hot as some have said it doesnt. So far no problems. Not to mention its cheap.
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very excited about this iron because I've used one in quilting class and I was looking forward to having one of my own. When I received my iron, the Auto Shutoff did not work. I called Oliso and they had me return the iron to them. They promptly replaced it. So, after the delay, I finally got my replacement iron. The iron works great for dry ironing, and I love the auto-lift. However, the steam setting does not work too well. Most of the time the steam won't come out unless I actually press the little steam button. I thought it might be confused with the Auto-lift so I tried it as a regular stand-up iron and it worked a little better, but I didn't buy the iron to use it like a regular iron. I really like the idea of not having to stand the iron up. It also leaks water - quite a bit as a matter of fact. I am very disappointed with this iron and sorry that I spent the money on it. I would not recommend it as a steam iron."
1,Iron stopped working after two weeks,"I too bought this 'so-called' wonderful iron only to have it stop working after two weeks of use.I have been unable to get up with customer support, sent several emails, and called with no response.My husband is an electrical engineer and has tried to repair the iron, only to find out that the part numbers have been 'conveniently' scratched off...no way to get replacement parts and fix it himself. It is probably a 25 cent item that went out but can't find any schematics on this piece of crap. I guess it's time to contact the BBB.I bought a Rowenta that can iron circles around this hunk of junk."
2,Broke just after a year,"I was loving this iron till it broke. The auto sensor quite working, which is the only reason I had bought this iron in the first place. I had it for 15 months when it broke and I called the company and was told there was only a 1 year warrenty on it. I would have given it 1 star, but I can still use the iron without the autolift, therefore 2 stars. I just feel I could have spent my $100 on a better iron."
3,"Great gimmick, so-so iron","we've had one of these for years. The pop-out feet are wonderful for people whose wrists are getting old because this feature eliminates having to stand the iron up while ironing. The steam could be much better. There does not seem to be enough holes in the sole plate, and you really don't see much steam coming out unless you press the surge button. That button, by the way, was the first thing to go south. we had a rowenta once and it worked great until we wore out the sole plate. now we need to replace this oliso, and we're still debating whether to buy another or go with a higher quality, mucho steamer. three stars -- flip a coin."
4,Oliso TG-1000 Steam Iron,"I find the iron to be great, takes a little getting used to, because of the auto lift. Only problem I have had is when I press the steam button the auto liftis enabled, I haven't figured out why."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND FRUSTRATION!!,"I bought this iron, and it worked less than 5 minutes. I got a rude man at customer service, told me to return iron where I bought it. When I told him I got it online, he said the damage must have been caused by shipping. Warranty does NOT cover shipping damage! Told me I could pay to ship it to San Francisco, they may or may not cover it, might send it back in 6 weeks. When I tried to ask him what would make the light start blinking yellow and ticking loudly, he told me in a rude voice that he was NOT technical support. I e-mailed them, still have not gotten a response after a week. A cheap iron from Walmart would have been a better investment. Would have given 0 stars, but not an option.Oliso steam iron with Auto-Lift System and STAINLESS STEEL Soleplate Model TG-1000"
1,Oliso Iron,This iron was everything it was advertised to be but just a month after purchase it no longer heats. I am waiting for a return email from Oliso Customer Service with instructions for warranty service.
2,OK home iron,"Like my old Rowenta better. This is heavier than many irons, the plate does not glide as smoothly at the Rowenta. The auto-lift is really just a nuisance unless you're used to leaving your iron with the heating surface down. E gad!As a seamstress I don't recommend this iron. As a homemaker who irons clothes, it's OK."
1,"Like the feet, but too little steam","I read and re-read the instructions. From the number of holes, I expected some steam. I can press the burst of steam, and the steam works, so it isn't clogged, but I can put my hand within an inch of the bottom of the iron (horizontally) at full steam and full heat, and can't feel a thing except the warmth of the iron (not going any closer). I ironed plain paper and can't feel a bit of moisture there either. Vertically, the steam burst button must be pressed. Not happy. I'm glad I didn't buy the 150 dollar version."
4,The Iron,"This iron takes a bit of getting used to..I still find myself setting it on end occasionally, but the fact it's not prone to falling off the ironing board as easy and you can never burn anything it worth the time to get used to it. Plus lets hope it won't be leaking water as much as my previous irons, since it won't fall off the board as easily as most irons that set on end."
3,Oliso TG-1000,"I've been using the iron for quilting projects. Here is is just over a month of use, and already the auto-lift is working sporadically for me. Have to unplug and replug in order for it to work again. Doesn't seem to heat as hot as it should."
5,Great Product for those that iron,"Touch the handle, and the supporting feet retract and the iron steams. Leave go of the handle, and the iron is automatically lifted of the ironing board and the steam stops. Saves the wrist. Great iron"
3,Hard To Imagine,"It is hard to imagine the barbarism that went on during WWII, but much of it did. This movie (gory as it may be) goes a long way towards capturing the essence of what one culture can do to another. Needless to say more.Aside from that, the CD arrived in very good condition with a very good turn around time.P. BlairSyracuse, New York"
5,Black dark tragedy,Prepared to watch massacre would be surprised by a level of horror this talented movie-doco presents.It is it of this doco genre.
1,Yuck!,"How can I describe this dreck? Well, overly looooong, repititious, bad acting....the idea behind the movie is sound but it's so crummily put together. A complete waste of money and time."
2,Nothing like Men Behind the Sun,"For those of you who have heard of Men Behind the Sun, you know that it is one of the most realistic and gory films of all time by the same director, T.F. Mau. Well, Black Sun: Nanking Massacre is the sequel to that movie, but it is nothing like it in terms of the gore factor (if gore is what you're looking for). Black Sun plays out more like a history film with a lot of semi-graphic violence. If you are a history buff, then you will probably enjoy this film thoroughly; but, like I said, if it's gore you're after, then don't get this one."
5,worth what it costs,"I had heard a lot of great things about this CD but hesitated to buy it at $25 plus. Good, great music transports you to a different place; this music does that. This is an amazing CD and worth what it costs."
5,Santa Was Good to Someone!,"I purchased this for my son-in-law, for Christmas a couple of years back. An EXTREMELY awesome book for motorcycle lovers; high quality!"
5,The Perfect Workout!!!!!!,"I have only done this workout 3 times, but I feel a huge difference! I am so excited to see results... Grace is so fun and knows how to train a womans body...no bulk! Music is out of this world!! EVIL is the hottest song I have ever heard!!"
1,Poor Longevity,"Worked great for about 6 months. Then it started eating a bulb once or twice a week, breaking the ceramic ends and burning out. Today it was 85 degrees outside and one of the contacts melted off (not in direct sunlight, under an eave). This was potentially a safety issue. Will be looking for a different brand for replacement."
5,Wonderful gift!,I bought this for my husband and our baby daughters for their Valentine's Day gift to show appreciation for their backgrounds. It is wonderful to see my daughters and their father dancing and playing to their culture music.
4,Sala in Puerto rico,Great album good quality recording and it rocks but only gripe is not enough of Celia Cruz.
2,Didn't work for me,I purchased this product to use my mac mini with a 2002 mac hd monitor. The conversion didn't work. Maybe the monitor didn't work. Tech support was not easily accessable. The product itself may or may not be effective. But it's roughly a $150 gamble. I sent the product back(in the original packaging and complete) with the assurance of a refund. Unfortunately I have received nothing from Hi Tech Media. I would highly discourage anyone from buying from Hi tech Media. I would not recomend this product if you aren't 100% sure it will work.
3,"Smells Great, But Potection?","I am a huge fan of Suave products, but purchased my first Suave deodorant product recently. I do like the smell of this one, its great, and it glides on real smooth. But I was not happy with the protection it has. Seems like it either doesn't work or it fades and has to be reapplied after an hour or so. Not that impressed with this one, Suave!"
3,A bit dated but fun,I bought this for a trip to Ireland. It was helpful but a drag that it wasn't on DVD and only on VHS.
2,Don't expect much,"This was a disappointing purchase. It's unfortunately more about trains than it is about Ireland and Northern Ireland. Palin isn't funny in it either. There was also a vaguely pro-loyalist lean to the reporting on the troubles. All in all, it was a strange, mildly condescending (in a ""look at the funny rock bowling games they play"" and ""is that a priest singing?"" way), and rather boring view of Ireland. The best part was the scenery."
3,Diamonds are only visible with a microscope!,I am basically happy with the watch except for 1 thing. The diamonds on the product image look MUCH bigger than the diamonds on the actual watch. I should have gone to a jewelry store and looked at the actual watch before I bought it. If I had I probably would have either gotten a watch with no diamonds at all or with diamonds actually large enough to see with the naked eye.
5,A Christmas Card list from the Past,I have owned and used this same book since 1982. I ran out of room several years ago and have searched ever since. There is more than enough room to add names and addresses and the paper makes them easily changed. There is a space to record those cards which you send and also for those that you receive. It is very well put together as mine has taken a beating over the years. The size also makes it very handy. It is about 5 inches by 7 inches and therefore fits into most Christmas card boxes making it easy to keep it handy when writing cards. Anyone who likes to keep track of cards from year to the next will appreciate it.
3,Metal Working for Dummies,"I was a metal working novice and needed information to fulfill an idea/business based on metal products. The book was particularly helpful in that it provided advice on how to set up a shop and gave a few insights on the ""tricks of the trade"". It lacked specific information on my desired field of expertise (screws and threads) however I should of picked that up from the title. All in all it gave me a good start on metal working and was a greater source of information the the fitters and turners in my local area."
3,rosewood jewelry box,"The jewelry box was okay in general but lacked some finishing touches. The jade piece set on the top of the lid was slightly off-center and the wood on the base was poorly finished. Overall, okay for the price but I would have paid more for a better quality product."
5,Goodbye Gene Eugene,"This is a pretty good mix drawn from the many Adam Again albums (most of which you can't get, although some sometimes show up at radrockers.com). My favorite Adam Again album is Ten Songs, and my favorite song from that, ""Who Can Hold Us?"" isn't on this compilation disc. Other than that though, this CD excellently represents the range of this amazing and unique band that sounds like no one else, yet recognizably carries a tradmark sound. Songs like ""Stone"" are not just good enough for radio, they're better, and sound like what radio would play if it were more diverse and less corporate. Does anyone know what's up with this ""Guadelupe"" album Amazon is listing? I'm not familiar with that CD. Can hard-core Adamanians enlighten me? By the way, Adam Again's first album, ""In a New World of Time"" cover art was done by Rev. Finster, the Georgia artist whose primitive-style art also appeared on REM and Talking Heads jackets. (More reason to hope more Adam Again is released again)."
5,Excellent filter,"Excellent product, i have it now working with my others filters, waiting for the biological layer be ready (15-21 days) to leave it alone in my acuarium."
5,excellent product,"Well-constructed filter that uses stainless steel clips to create a seal instead of plastic clips like every other filter manufacturer I've seen. I think the person below just had bad luck with the shipper to get the product broken on arrival.I own several filters (Eheims, Fluvals, Penn Plax) and have found the Eheims to be the best - completely silent and well-constructed. The Pro Series is much easier to prime and perform maintenance on - and it's also more money. For the price, it's tough to beat this silent filter."
4,Great Purchase,I've been using this filter for over a week now and have to say it was a great investment. Only 24 hours after setting it up my tank was crystal clear. The reason why I gave four stars is because of the lack of detailed instructions on how to properly set it up using the water flow control valves and that the box came a little torn and the canister with a couple of tiny scratches on the side. Other than that and as far as performance goes I have no complaints whatsoever.
5,Great Filter,I have 8 Eheims running on varies tanks at home most are heavily planted. The oldest 2213 was bought in 1995 and still works great.I would definitely recommend this to others.
5,Best Filter On the Market,"The BEST, enough said. I had a friend recommend this product years back when I first started my aquarium as a hobby. Now, years later I still use the same Eheim 2215 filtration system for my 55 gallon tank. Must buy.Pros:1) Quiet2) Reliable3) Easy to clean4) Simply just works and does what it does best and that is filtering my aquarium and keeping my fishes health5) Reusable media (the only replacement I had to make were the carbon pad and the white foam pads, but majority of the time I just give everything a good rinse and it is good to go)Cons:1) Priming is not automatic, you need to get dirty and start the priming yourself2) Wished the default tubes were clear or black instead of green coloredOverall great buy for the money and boy does it last.S.Wang"
5,Eheim Filters,"I've owned pretty much every size of Eheim classic filters for years. They are by far my favorite canister filter. Instillation and setup is a breeze with these things. On FW setups you won't need to clean it out for MONTHS. You can easily change media and use whatever media you want. I've specially used the 2211 filter on a Planted FW setup of 8 gallons and it worked great. I do agree with the other reviewer that stated that the 2213 is around the same price. But for anything from maybe FW 20 gallons and under, i would suggest this filter. any higher, i would go with the 2213"
5,Excellent filter!,"Got this filter when my other filter broke. So quiet! It was relatively quick to set up also. A little messy, but quick."
5,"i love this filter, i will never use a different brand.","i love this canister filter. it works great in my freshwater 55 gal aquarium. i have a massive amount of live plants and some live breeder fish. as soon as i set it up and got it running, it sucked up some fry, so i put a net over the intake. where the intake connects to the canister i noticed a super slow drip and panicked. i made a total n00b mistake. the curved tube that connects the intake to the canister is NOT a swivel connection. it screws on, i did not realized this and that is way it was dripping, i connected the tubes and tightened it up. BAM! no more leak. totally my fault. i thought i should include this i my review incase anyone else makes this simple mistake."
5,simple and effective filter,I have three different kinds of Eheim filters and this one for the price is the best of the three that I use. It is easy to set up and also simple to maintain. I would suggest this filter for the beginner or for someone who is looking to set up a 60 gallon aquarium. Eheim filters are very well constructed and have a solid reputation in the aquarist community. I will only use Eheim filters from now on.
5,1st Eheim and couldn't be happier,"I truly couldn't be happier with this filter. In my 75 gallon tank it is strong and quiet. Build quality is great. The instructions aren't the greatest but they worked, but since there are so many people that have these filters so you can find some great install instructions with photos online."
4,Great external aquarium filter,This filter does a great job of clearing the water in the aquarium. It is super quiet...you can't even tell it is running. It is by far the best external canister type filter I have ever owned. The only complaint I have is the directions are super vague! I found a YouTube video that explained how to set it up other wise I still might be scratching my head in utter confusion.
5,"Works Great, Super Quiet.",My last filter was drawing in air from somewhere and very loud (surging). Changed all gaskets etc. Still no improvement. Switched to this one. Don't even know it is there. Super quiet. Easy to set up. Do read some of the internet instructions and you tube videos on set up. Very happy with this product.
5,cleans my red eared slider turtle's 20-40 gallon tank.,I finally found a filter that cleans my turtles tank. Turtles can be very dirty but this filter can clean it and it takes the smell away all of it. The set up instructions are a bit hazy but you can find set up instructions for eheim 2215 filter on youtube and it help alot. I highly recommened to pet owners that need a good filter for your slider turtles. I recommened that you at least clean the filter every 15 days for your red eared slider turtle or any turtle so it works better but dont necessarily need to clean the tank just the filter and its media will help the flow go faster.
4,inexcusably bad instructions,"Good filter as others have said, but the set-up instructions are extremely poor. Considering that you are dealing with electricity, large volumes of water, water under pressure, and interior floors, one would think that Eheim would do a better job of helping avoid potentially disastrous mistakes in set-up. Prepare to search the internet for help."
5,Filter,It is a very good filter for my fresh water 75 gallon fish tank. Quiet and easy to change media. It is the Eheim Classic 2215 Canister Filter with Media for up to 92 gallons of water. Great purchase price from Amazon.
1,Low output with an in-line heater or CO2 Diffuser,"There is no reason to buy this filter over the 2213EHEIM Classic 250 External Canister Filter ? 2213. The 2213 is roughly the same size, it has full 13mm input/output unlike this filter which is only 9mm on the output. Also the 2213 has a canister inside which makes removing/changing media so much easier. Pricewise they are about the same and it is absolutely worth it since the larger output makes a huge difference in the flow. I use in-line accessories like a heater and an inline diffuser which slow down the flow of water so the added mm is a huge plus."
1,Bad product,"I review this filter on YouTube , then i thought I will get right one for my 20 gallons . When the package arrived to me. I saw the box get damage, and a lot of sand in filter, they might give me used filter( not look like new) . I tried to use it in 2 days, and then it was leaking water from intake . That's why , it is cheaper than fluval filterI returned it to department for get my refund"
3,Great filter - silly instructionos,It is silent and seems to be working well. BUT I needed to do lots and lots of research to get it installed. The instructions are terrible!!!!
2,Arrived Defective,I can't even comment on how it works because it was broken right out of the box. I do NOT recommend. Terrible. Big Al's at least took it back and refunded me. so I give kudos for their customer service. BUT I wish that I didn't get a crappy product. I went with Fluval 406 and have not looked back.
1,Product quality lacking,"The first time I ordered the Eheim 2213 it came with a broken intake valve. Since it protrudes from the bottom I thought it may have been damaged in transit. Then, I sent back the first one and requested a replacement. Amazon had it to me in 2 days at not additional charge with a Saturday delivery. I was excited to get it set up and running since this is my first canister filter and I've read about how great it is. I unpacked the second unit and everything looked good until I unclamped the head unit. The piece of plastic that holds one of the four clips was broken. It seems to me that the plastic used to make this unit is easily breakable. All in all I can't comment on the performance of the unit, but as far as overall quality goes I wasn't impressed. I definitely expected better. So, instead I ordered a Fluval which I hope I'll have better luck with."
2,never got to try it,"I am reviewing only shipping and handling here as I never got to try the filter. It arrived with the exterior parts smashed in shipping. I can't even say if it was Amazon since the filter is packed loosely in a cardboard box, but Amazon did nothing to mitigate that as they simply put the Eheim box into a larger box with only a little paper to prevent jostling (ineffective). I could hear that it was broken before I opened the package. Awaiting replacement now, tho I feel I am likely wasting my time."
1,Horrible!,"After reading many reviews, i decided to buy this filter. Was super excited to receive the filter and couldn't wait to set it up. That didn't happen! As soon as I opened the box, the plastic spray bar broke. Next, i took out the other plastic parts and they were cracked. I took the filter out the box and the clamps securing the top fell off (broken). The filter might be good but its cheap quality material. I returned it to Amazon and purchased a XP4 instead."
2,Flimsy Filter,"I found this product to be defective upon opening the box. The tabs on the top of the canister used to clamp the lid on were broken on arrival. Frankly, they are far too small and flimsy to withstand such a high presure environment and moving water. Eheim should have designed this differently, so I just asked for a refund instead of a replacement. This would have been my third filter, but I've found my first one, a Fluval 303, to be the most rugged and reliable. Construction has gone downhill in the filter world and that is unacceptable. My advice: don't buy any fish filter without examining it hands on first."
4,"Bad Instructions, easy setup, lots o' power!","Well, I received mine yesterday and hooked it up after work. As everyone says, the instructions are terrible, but they give you a general idea of what is going on. I used these sites to help with installation.[...][...]Also, if you have the valves open on the intake and output tubes, the canister will prime itself. I just hooked it up, the canister and tubes filled and I plugged it in. There wasn't even any air left in the canister. Very pleased so far!!"
3,Incomplete,"The book is incomplete. It does not talk about the consequences of sin. It only has about two sentences on the eternal consequences of sin in chapter 7. People who have rejected Christ are going to hell. A whole chapter should have been dedicated to that topic. As for backlsiding Christians, that also required a separate chapter. Backsliders don't lose their salvation but they will not enter the millenial kingdom of Christ and they will not enter the New Jerusalem ever. The consequences are missing so for me this book is incomplete."
5,Intricate Carving,Well packed very fragile item and it arrived in perfect shape. More intricate than I thought it would be. Was a gift and she really liked it.
3,Easier to use cheaper regular batteries.,"I have had these for a couple of years. These worked good for a while, then they stopped charging all the way. I find it is just as economical to use non-rechargable batteries as they are so cheap."
3,"Good information in a hard to read, dry format.","This book has a great deal of information on the inner workings of Oracle under Unix and it covers many aspects of the Unix operating system and how it interacts with Oracle. I found the book to be very useful, the only drawback is: it is very dry and the language could be very hard to follow for some people."
3,Kind of random,"A weird book. Bit outdated, some semi helpful tips included in the text. Not a bad buy for the money. It looks cool on my desk too!"
5,Tells It How It Is !,A story that shows the child sex trade how it really is acted convincingly. A sad film that makes you feel for these people and wanna help. Not graphic physically but so well acted its not required. Set in Cambodia and Vietnam. The new young actress in the lead is a wonderful little actress. Love to see more of her.
4,Go Pack!,These slippers are comfortable and quite warm! They seem to run a tad small though. I got a size XL and they just fit. I wear a size 12 shoe.
4,Dad loves em!,"These are being used for running outside. They are soft, cushy, and the sole will wear well. Good thing we got them before the playoffs!"
4,Cushy and comfy,"They are cushy, comfortable, and they don't slide on your foot. The soles are grippy and great for walking outside. My wife surprised me with these Packer slippers - I love em'."
3,"great product, but.....","I'd have to say I was very pleased with this product. However, at the cost of not feeling my teeth and gums for a day or so, wasn't nice...did it get my teeth whiter? absolutely...but the moment this stuff touches your gums, you're gonna be in some pain...but, on the contrary--once you have the mold trays fitted, ready to go, make sure you take a razor or something and cut the top part of the mold to make sure it's below the gum line, and you'll be ok!"
4,Pleased!,"This product works great and I will purchase again. Its hard for me to commit to the time because Im busy or too tired to fool with. If you keep it off the gums you're good, if not you will be uncomfortable for a couple of days."
2,"Nice looking, but poor performance","While these lights work well and look nice, the light they produce is very dim. You'd need several of these to achieve the same level of light that a single unit of another type of fixture/bulb combo would produce.They do work well as sort of fishy nightlights though.I don't recommend these for a primary lighting source."
1,Poor Product,"I purchached this product to tie down a 10ft Screen Gazebo. While screwing them into the ground, 3 of the 4 augers snapped off the holding rod, the weld just busted. I would not buy these again because I would not trust them, even if they didn't break. What kind of load can they take from wind when they cannot even take being screwed into the ground"
3,augers are junk,"As others have said, the augers snap off. Perhaps the hard Ohio clay? I'm not sure. I ended up taking an angle grinder to them and cutting the auger part off. Then took my sledge and pounded them into the ground. My shed didn't blow away in the hurricane so they seemed to do their job. Sandy took a few of my other items that weren't anchored down..."
5,excelente documentario,"excelente documentario sobre a geraao dos anos 90, mas principalmente sobre o rock alternativo/indie rock que comeou a engatinhar a partir de 1991, vale muito a pena recomendo a todos, sonic youth pra sempre"
5,I Saw This Back In The Day,I saw this movie back in the early 90's and I still think about it. I bought it tonight so I can share it with people that don't understand the punk rock / alternative culture.It's a good one to have in your movie library.
5,Brought me back to my youth!,As soon as I heard the DVD version was out couldn't wait to buy this piece of history.The sound is outstanding and the video quality keeps the super 8 characteristic so well even though this documentary have been migrated from analog to digital format.Totally recommended!
5,BRILLIANT MOVIE,"This is defianantly the best music oreinted video i have seen. It completely captures the 90s grunge/punk era. Everybody was in this video....Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Dinosaur jr., babes in toyland, gumball, bob mould, the ramones, iggy pop, and courtney love. It also shows the hardcore grunge/punk fans....very cool."
4,Seems like just yesterday...,"Ok. The music is great. Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr. You can't go wrong. Maybe the editing is a bit ADD at points. It seems like a lot of the Nirvana footage is just scraped together from a variety of different songs, but not the song you're actually hearing.Still it's all great footage. Thurston (of Sonic Youth) gets annoying very quickly with his spoken word/rap thing over the opening credits. Other than that it nicely encapsulates youth culture in 1991. Not as well as Monterey Pop did for 1967, but what can you do.Haven't gotten to the bonus features yet."
2,Not what I expected,"I wish I would have read the reviews on this video before I purchased it. If your wanting to see the bands perform this is a big disappointment. If you love Sonic Youth you'll probably like it and don't get me wrong there are bits of it that are funny but it's pretty much the lead singer talking and acting stupid through the whole thing. I didn't find that amusing at all, I hate that dude! I just wanted him to shut up and show the bands playing. Then it finally shows Nirvana and through every song the camera jumps around and it flashes to other stupid stuff so you don't see much of the band and what they do show is not the best of any of the bands. It's very unfortunate because it could have been a good video if they would have just filmed the bands playing and left out some of the other stuff. All and all from quality to sound it is not a great value for the money I paid."
3,Get it for the performance footage,"And fast forward through the interviews and narration by Thurston Moore. Seriously, the whole movie seems to be one bitter, over analyzed rant by Thurston and to a lesser extent by Lee Ronaldo to come up with an excuse why Nirvana broke the underground to the masses and not Sonic Youth, after years of touring, performing, and recording. It's pretentious, obnoxious, and gets annoying real quick. On the other hand, the concert footage of the Youth, Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr and Babes in Toyland really almost makes up for it. This is good, good stuff. And seeing Nirvana cut up, Kurt Cobain actually SMILING and joking around is worth the price of admission.If they ever put this on DVD, you'll be able to skip to the good bits easier."
3,thurston almost ruins it,"dave markey should be shot for not editing out 90% of thurstons retarded ramblings from this film. i don't know if thurston was just trying to be as weird as possible or if he was on pcp or something. also, if you are just looking for a straight-foward live performance tape, then avoid this. alot of the songs are like three different shows edited togethor with a bunch of lame effects. i think markey did this because of his lack of camera angles, as it appears he shot this thing with a single camera.the ramones cameo is beyond retarded, with horrible video and sound quality and joey and johnny appear to be the only original members. the same with gumball and babes in toyland, they just suck.some of the backstage stuff is pretty amusing, mostly when thurston is nowhere to be seen. if you can find this tape for pretty cheap and you are a SY fan, then pick it up."
4,The best of early 90s alternative (when it really was that),"A very humorous and fascinating look at Nirvana and Sonic Youth's 1991 European Tour. There is a classic bathroom scene with Thurston Moore that is one of the highlights of this documentary. The most interesting thing about this film is seeing Nirvana before the explosion of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". It's hard to believe that at one time they were just three guys who were opening for Sonic Youth. Dinosaur Jr. plays a few legs of the tour and J. Mascis contributes to the humor of the film. The spontaneousness of this back stage glimpse makes ""The Year Punk Broke"" a classic moment in time in the history of true alternative music."
2,Lots of light but dont drop it!,"This light is great for the bright light and long cordbut dont drop it, it will stop working. Trouble lightsare meant to be dropped once in a while and keepworking that is why they have such a stong case.The circuit board and light tube are directly in contactwith the outer case so any shock to the case shocksthe circuit board and light tube. Replacing the lighttube did not fix it. A fragile light."
1,Work Light arrived broken,Work light did not work upon arrival. Light bulb was bad and unit was bad when plugged into multiple 12 volt outlets. Tested unit with volt meter and no power to bulb connections when unit is on. Tested bulb in another working light and did not work. Discarded item.
2,the ultimate challenge-what to do with this book,"after purchasing and reading this book i am at a loss for words other than the author wrote this with the sole purpose of just making money. there is virtually nothing in these pages that would aid me in running anything. you could easily get the info from a reputable running site and more quickly than reading this ""book"". only been running for 20 some years and competitive at it and found this a total waste of my time. burned well in the fireplace though. i couldnt give it away with a good conscience. thanks"
1,Skip this one.,While I generally like Amy's products I found this one absolutely awful. From its un-palatable grayish color to its starchy flavorless jelly-like consistency. I was glad I tried one(1) out from a store before committing to a case. Phew!
1,Yuck,"I've tried several Amy's soups and have loved them. I typically love corn chowder, so I was looking forward to trying this one. Firstly, I was shocked that one can had almost 400 calories and a whopping 20 grams of fat! Not what you would expect from a vegetarian soup. Secondly, the tast was gross. It reminded me of canned Dinty Moore stew. I was really dissapointed :("
4,Excellent,The watch arrived faster than expected and is truely an excellent time piece. Although I've only had it a couple of weeks I expect I will like it in couple of years as much as I do now.
4,Great Deal,"Product was as described and shipped promptly. I was a little unsure about placing the order because the price just seemed too good to be true, but I amVERY happy to say everything is fine and it is the real deal. Great value!!!!"
4,Elegant and inexpensive,I like Seiko watches. This one in particular is one I prefer wearing on a day to day basis. Elegant looks without the bragging; not to mention you will never need batteries again!
3,Beautiful Watch but...,"I love the watch and so did my husband! It was to be a birthday gift for him but Amazon was unable to verify the authenticity as well as the warranty length as the item description said to ""contact seller of record"" for the warranty. They were also unable to put me in touch w/ the seller after the sale. Per Seiko USA in NJ: if the item was not sold by an authorized dealer, the warranty is void so I had no choice but to return as I was unable to verify the seller as being an authorized dealer...but it was a beautiful watch though. I will purchase from a verified authorized dealer as this is a watch I want my husband to have for years to come."
3,Seiko watch,"The watch is beautiful and the sales process was great, quick and complete.However,on the third week the crystal face and ring fell off the watch and the hands got bent. This should not happen to a $700.00 watch! It is presently at Seiko and I am awaiting a response, replacement."
4,very nice product!!,I think this is a beautiful watch---it is heavy but in a quality way--thicker than most watches but long sleeve shirts will still fit over it---i am pushing 60 years old---the old eyesight isn't what it used to be---my only complaint is that the gold watch hands don't show up as well as i would like against the white background of the face---i went to a retail store to see the watch in person before i bought it--took my wife with me---this watch comes in two color/models---i liked it with the silver and black dial(snp007)---i could see it better and it was an 007 (i guess i've seen too many Bond movies in my life)---my wife thought this gold and white dial was more elegant---i think i would prefer readability over elegance but i still love this watch---have had many compliments on it---including my wife---so it must be the watch for me!!Take a test drive at a retail store--Macy's has a large selection of Seikos but not all stores carry all models--call first!!
5,Nicest watch in my collection,"Not having the money for a Rolex or something in that class and yet a big fan of good looking, accurate, and functional timepieces, I purchased this at Amazon, going only on the picture and description they provide. I am not disappointed. This watch is beautiful and classy looking, functional (I love the large ""Date"" display), never needs a battery, and so far, has kept perfect time. One final note, the price on Amazon was $100 cheaper than the jewelery stores I checked."
2,Fades in the stretch,"I wore this watch happily for about a year and a half. It is a handsome timepiece, it feels extremely solid and it kept perfect time . . . until it didn't. This is the second Seiko kinetic watch I have owned that has begun failing to keep and hold a charge after a relatively short period of use. The second hand started skipping in two-second intervals (indicating a low charge) and shaking the watch back and forth as recommended in the instructions only keeps it working normally for a few hours. The kinetic-electric mechanism in Seiko watches is fine in principle but it doesn't appear to be reliable in the long run."
4,"GOOD EATING AND GOOD STORIES, TOO","Frank Stitt is an award winning chef and a third generation Alabamian whose appreciation of and devotion to the cuisine of his native locale is embodied in this luxe cookbook - his first. He's unique, creating dishes that are Provencal influenced yet enticingly southern.This generously illustrated 384 page volume holds recipes ranging from the traditional relishes to the more than mouth-watering Fresh Roast Pork Rack with Corn Pudding and Grilled Eggplant.Have a sweet tooth? It'll be more than satisfied with Bourbon Panna Cotta and Sweet Potato Tart with coconut crust. (Seconds, please?)More than a cookbook, Frank Stitt's Southern Table features stories about the pea-shelling machine at the farmer's market, the winter quail hunt, and the assorted vendors who hawk local produce.All of these recipes typify the dishes found at the acclaimed Highlands Bar and Grill.- Gail Cooke"
1,Nothing I would ever use,I was disappointed in this book. It wasn't anything like I expected after watching some of his recipes on TV. Will be putting it in the ProLife book sale box.
4,Good introductions to distributed objects world,I am able to get all the information about current technical development of distributed objects in this book. I wish more publications about this subject can appear in the market place.
3,"Decent overview, CORBA part a let down","This book provides a decent overview of the topics covered. Apart from the Java/COM part, I did not find anything special in this book. Most of the topics covered here now have dedicated books providing an in depth presentation. So if you want details, look elsewhere. A word of caution: some parts of the CORBA coverage are misleading. For example, the authors say that the osagent is the ORB itself ! NO, the ORB is just a collection of libraries and network resources. I found Doug Pedrick's book much better in terms of the Java/Visibroker coverage. So if you are going to look at the Corba part elsewhere, you might as well look for the remaining topics elsewhere too!"
2,Tries to cover to much and fails!,"I bought the book due to the chapter on POA and IIOP, and when I finally got around to read the chapters it primarily was a listing of the IDLs with a superficial description. I also found several errors."
3,"Good reference book, tough read.","I tried to literally read every book I buy from front to back. Unfortunately this reads like an encyclopedia and I never finished it. I have, however, used the book for reference a few times. If anything, the book is quite comprehensive."
1,Don't try it,"This book tries to cover all the topics (poorly). To make it worse, some places for illustrations are left blank in the copy I bought. I email the pulblisher, and they never got back to me."
3,Not good--not bad.,"Thank goodness there is a star in between good and bad, because that's exactly where this book falls. There were a little too many subplots going on; and the little girl, Sophy, turning out to be psychic just added an unnessary element to the story. Other than that, it was an okay read."
4,Fun start to a new series,"Summer Mulcahey is an FBI agent, she was wounded and her partner killed on a stakeout, and she is currently persona non grata with her fellow agents in Philadelphia. She is assigned to guard the children of a San Francisco ADA engaged to be married to a senator slated to become the next president. Unbeknownst to her, the senator called in a favor, and a friend of the family, who just happens to be a SEAL is also watching the family. A career criminal is threatening the O'Connor family, and someone is trying to blackmail her with and old secret. Summer and Gabe Morgan are there to keep everyone safe at the expense of their own safety.This is a fast moving book with alot of action and romance. There are two simultaneous plots involving Summer and Gabe and Cara O'Connor and Tate Winslow. The children's characters are very well developed and they are integral to the story. This book held my interest from beginning to end and I wasn't expecting much based on the promos."
1,Was I reading the same book?,"I know that in general, the romance novel is not the deepest novel you can pick up, but that is not why we read them. This is my first experience with Christina Skye. In reading all the other reviews, I'm confused by the enthusiasm. I can't enjoy a book if I don't feel that the people in it are even remotely real. These conversations don't sound like anything I've ever heard between two people, unless it was in a very bad high school play (the same thing happens in Joanne Fluke's Hannah Swensen mysteries). I've found several best selling authors with huge fan bases around books that have juvenile or horribly stilted dialogue. Honestly, go back and re-read some of these conversations and tell me that they sound real."
3,Just so-so,This book was just OK. I liked the hero but I wasn't that crazy about the heroine. She was kinda grumpy and I didn't feel she had a good sense of humor. I liked that she was part of the FBI but it would have been great if she could have kicked someone's butt or something. I didn't like the side stories and found myself skipping ahead to the parts that dealt with the main characters.
2,Not her best work. Missing a love connection,"I love Christina Skye, but this book was not her best work. I didn't feel a connection between the two main characters and then all of a sudden they were in love. There were too many subplots that took the focus off Summer and Gabe which made it difficult for a reader to become invested in these two. She just needed to spend a little more time developing their relationship."
4,"Completely unintelligible, but still...",Kandinsky is by far my favorite painter and he has influenced my painting so I had to buy this book. I've found it useless in helping me but it's valuable in reading how Kandinsky thought about the elements in his work.
2,Has no pictures of artwork,"I purchased this as a gift to someone who enjoys looking at kadinsky's works.This book is all diagrams and geometric line drawings, complicated looking and written like a geometry lesson.Im certain is a help to artists who are seeking this type of info but the description did not indicate what type of illustrations were inc'd very well.I wanted to let anyone in my situation know its not pic's of artwork its technical specs only."
5,Best Basketball Book Bar None,I am a high school basketball coach and have read a lot of books about basketball and teaching basketball. This is still my bible. All coaches and players should read this book and use it as a reference.
2,Old Version,My toddler just didn't believe this Old version to be the Pingu she knows and loves. She wasn't interested.
3,Pingu has changed,"I am no Pingu expert. I own one of the first Pingu DVDs and my kids love it. But something has happened to Pingu since. The whole ""feel"" of the cartoon has changed. It is as if it underwent some ""hollywoodization"". I wonder if the franchise has changed owners since. There seem to be more frequent cuts, the scenes change in a more rapid sequence, the characters are moving faster, seem to be less ""cute"", becoming more of ""action characters"". I miss the the old Pingu."
3,a different pingu,Everyone that has seen the first two Pingus movies (ages 3 to 52) has really liked them a lot. This new one wasn't recieved as well. Its much faster paced and Pingu is not as sweet as he used to be.
3,don't need to know Japanese,"without subtitles, the acton was easy enough to follow, cute movie, good for late-night when a person doesn't want a lot of action, talk, etc. several little vignettes"
1,Not impressed,"lice live on the scalp and this product doesn't let the metal actually touch the scalp. it's very difficult to get any lice out with this comb. i used this comb as thoroughly as i could through her hair and only got about 4 lice out. i then had to use the RID shampoo system and i got at least 100 more lice out that way. she was covered in them and the liceguard robi comb only picked up a few, and then it was only the adults that it picked up. it wouldn't pick up the really little ones. it wasn't anywhere near as helpful as i had hoped. i even pondered trying to get my money back because it's a product i will not be able to use. it's just not worth the hassle for the tiny amount of lice it actually got."
1,Only works for the very large Lice,"My daughter has very long, thick hair. I used Nix and she mysteriously got horribly sick 48 hours later. The doctor told me it couldn't be the shampoo, but I am 100% convinced it was! It didn't even work! I have been picking out nits and live bugs from her hair every day for almost a week. I bought this thinking it would save me a lot of time. NOPE. I ran it through her hair yesterday and it didn't give off a warning that anything was around. I thought...cool, she's finally free of bugs. Boy was I wrong! I was looking through her hair this morning and saw one crawling. I grabbed the Robi comb and ran it over the bug. NOTHING. The bug slid right inbetween the teeth of the comb. I grabbed my cheap $7 metal comb and ended up getting SEVEN bugs out of her hair! The teeth of this comb are just too widely spaced. It didn't get any of the bugs off her head at all. The cheaper alternative worked much better and is a lot cheaper!"
1,This comb does nothing.,"I bought it for my 4 year old, this is the 2nd time we tried to use it, she got lice last year and again this year. We gave the comb a 2nd try and this comb is worthless, it does not remove anything, my daughter has fine straight hair and it just doesn't work.My wife always ends up dying our daughters hair because those special shampoos we buy wont kill the lice either."
1,Don't be fooled !!!,"My kids had lice 2 years ago and I treated it the traditional way. I purchased lice killing products from over the counter and they are gone. since that time, I got obsessed with this problem and I check their heads every couple of day. Every time I see something weired, I assume it could be a nit and I use the treatment once to make sure they are fine. So I searched for some kind of detector to tell me if what I occasionally see is lice or just a dirt. I found this product and thought as the name says, Lice Detector. I immediately purchased it, but it came out to be just a lice comb. it vibrates while you comb the hair to kill the lice, but I'm not sure if the lice die because of the vibration or because you'll comb it out anyway. THIS IS NOT A DETECTOR as they say but a comb. If you need to comb the lice and nits out, just buy the regular over the counter lice combs, do not be fooled and pay $20.99 + shipping when you can buy any comb from any store for a couple of dollars."
1,i can't rate something i didn't get,i waited on my order for a few week's and i got thing i order 3 one for each of my kid's and they never came so i went to my drug store and got them and my kid's just love them
1,This was a waste of time,"This did NOT work for us at all. We have been treating our hair for months and finally got this. It did not detect any lice. I used it for hours on my hair and my daughters hair, too. Our heads were still itching. The next day we used LiceFree spray and loads of tiny lice and nymphs came out. I was shocked to see so many. The comb was functioning correctly, just not detecting any of these tiny lice."
4,This does work,"Yes it works. But you will need other products too - to get out the nits. It does help find the bugs and zaps them, but I did find it would also zap dandruff and if it is stuck to your head it feels strange. This is great for peace of mind for me, since my daughter has had lice I have been itchy everywhere. I run this through my hair just to check... and so far I have been lice free."
2,Waste of Money,"This was a waste of money. It never detected a live bug, but I know there were some because I saw them. It also stopped working after 4 short uses."
3,Does nothing for nits,"My daughter came into contact with headlice at a sleepover recently. After checking my entire family we found five actual lice amongst us which were killed upon treatment. I did find some nits scattered in my childrens hair and was fearful that they would hatch and create more lice so I purchased the robi comb. I ran the comb through their hair and when it ran across a nit nothing happened. I thought perhaps I had a defective comb, but then read that it only works on actual hatched lice. So as far as preventing lice from hatching (which is why I initially purchased it) it really does nothing."
3,its okay,"doesnt do the full job, but helps. be careful, it might give the kids a slight battery kick behind their ears"
3,Yeah it helps but not great,"So. Tried a bunch of lice products and bottom line most do nothing more than dampen the hair while you pick out the lice. This device is for dry hair only and does help debulk the lice but still is not a stand Lone treatment. Honestly the most effective treatment is to wash the hair with lots of conditner use a nit comb and heat (blow dry, curling iron or straightener) and then wash and dry all in contact fabric, on hot if posssible. Everything else -combs, brushes etc stick in a zip lock bag for2 weeks."
2,If you have straight hair then this is the product...,"It probably is a good product, but my daughter is biracial and has curly hair and this thing is terrible with her hair...It's hard to get through her hair and stops, not for a louse, but just because it gets stuck...I tried for an hour, but it was no good. The next day I thought I'd give it another shot, but it wouldn't even turn on :-\...so I just brought it back...lol...So I guess if your child has easy to comb through hair, then it's great...You can't use it on wet hair and that's when my daughter's hair is easiest to comb though...so just didn't work for me."
3,Good when it works!,"I have a love-hate relationship with the Robi Comb. I think it helped me conquer a lice infestation. It's particularly good at pulling out and alerting me to tiny nymphs that I would have missed on a visual inspection. And when it zaps the lice, it's good to know if I don't get the bugs off the child's head, they're dead and can't bite or reproduce. HOWEVER, I suspected that my kids were reinfested so ran the RobiComb through their hair. Not a blip in the buzzing, so I thought we were home free. Not so! Something was WRONG with Mr. RobiComb, because I checked again later with an ordinary metal lice comb and found lots o'little licey. I got a new rOBIComb and use it, but in conjunction with traditional, non-electric metal combs."
1,Returned it within 1 hour of opening the box,"1) It does not tell you in the description that this comb reacts to dandruff the same as it does to lice. Therefore, with a child that has dandruff you are getting constant false positive results.2) within the first 10 minutes of use it broke down completely. We call customer support and got to speak to a person after 15 minutes on hold. We were then subjected to a 45 minute call filled with long pauses while the technician put us on hold to speak to a supervisor. Were told to ""fiddle"" with the battery contacts because sometimes they ""get out of whack"". Finally they gave up and we returned it."
3,Its OK !!!,It does kill lice but not all of them cause its very hard to comb threw girls long hair . It also does not kill eggs . This product is alright if you want to get the live numbers down . But if you want this to work then you still need to do a chemical treatment then comb threw there hair with the metal lice comb and then use this product for any new hatches that you missed with the treatment steps ...
3,it alright,I bought this after my daughter got headlice. I am pregnant and dont need the chemicals around. I also cant afford the other treatment. So I bought this since I can do it on a regular basis as many times as I need to. My only suggestion would be to make sure your hair is combed out before you use it and make sure your hair is sectioned out as well. My hair is thick and if it got too big of a piece through it it would stop like it hit something but nothing would be on it when it was through my hair.
1,unreliable product,"while this product seems to have great reviews, I found that it worked about 4 times and then stopped working. It was used as was suggested----but now no longer works.I would not purchase another one."
3,Had to return two and the third one who knows,Bought at Walgreens not at Amazon.First 2 stopped working after 1 use. Third one only makes the sound about 1/2 the time. Will clean it and see if that was wrong but I can't see it being dirty if it hasn't been used much.Don't know how effective. Wish after it killed the nits it did something to remove them or loosen the glue.
4,Life-saver in battle against lice,"This little device is pretty much worth it's weight in gold and is one of the most effective parts of our family's delousing strategy. It really does zap even small, newly hatched lice. You still need to deal with the nits on the hair shaft (I just cut the hair below the nit) and remember to throw pillows/sheets, pjs, coats, hats etc in the dryer every day and vacuum off car seats. We used Robi Comb every day for 2+ weeks and now that we've found no more lice/nits, we use it once a week to make sure the kids haven't caught them again at school. Robi Comb saved me more hours than I can count from having to comb through my daughter's thick hair. It takes 10 minutes. My son's short hair takes maybe a minute to comb through.I gave it 4 stars because sometimes I have to jiggle the comb to get it to start buzzing. It's also important to remember to use the little brush or blow on the comb first to dislodge any dust if it's not buzzing."
3,killing lice brings satisfaction,"killing them is fun. better than shaving your daughter bald or dipping her head in tar. But it's not as good as the Nit Free Terminator. This thing left a few lice behind. So I should probably give it two stars, but like I said, killing lice is fun."
2,"Alot of good information, but not what it should be","My heart goes out to Ben Matthews (below) who had this thing for a level 4700. That's nuts. I had this book for a level 222 and it was a complete joke. There's a lot of good information and stories about what makes a good e-commerce site, I'll give it that. But there's nothing in here to really give you an edge as far as this stuff goes. The entire point of this book can be summed up in this statement:""Look at amazon, look at google and look at yahoo. Look for reasons why they're successfull and take note. Do the same practices in your online sites"".This book is an interesting read, but for a bunch of stories and business jargon it's not worth the money."
3,Has Some Great Moments,"This CD is very funny at times, but at others it falls flat. I originally got it because Doug Stanhope recommended it on his website. Sorry Andy, but you're no Doug Stanhope. Before you get this album, try ""Sicko"" or ""Die Laughing."""
5,Great CD,"I simply love his singing. This CD has several good songs. So sad he is no longer with us, I would have enjoyed seeing him perform."
3,Where's the gain?,"I've used K&N; filters in the past, with noticeable fuel mileage improvement and perceptible power improvement.I didn't notice any improvement with this on my Jeep. In fact, I dare say my fuel mileage went down compared to the factory filter.Unfortunately, without delivering the fuel mileage and performance gains K&N; claims for their products, I can't give this product any rating higher than mediocre. On the upside, I'll be using this filter for a long time to come, without the need for replacement and putting waste in a landfill."
2,Wrong Filter,Don't trust the drop down tabs on Amazon because you will probably get the wrong air filter. Delivery was on time but when I get the wrong filter again I'm not giving a good rating. Don't trust the Dimensions you see for the filter because they won't be correct either. K & N Air Filters are great filters but Amazon.com really sucks at producing the right filter.
5,quality K and N,i have owned a k and n for every vehicle I've had. the quality of the product is vastly superior to o.e and you can't beat the million mile warranty. the increase in throtle response is noticeable. i havent been able to verify an increase in mpg. but it has only been in for 2 days
4,"Reliable, Reusable, Good buy","For those who don't know- these filters come pre-oiled. I made the mistake of oiling one for my motorcycle and it sucked some in the MAF sensor. After drying it in the sun and wind for a few days no problems. I want to say my MPG and performance increased but it could be just in my head. The biggest thing for me with K&N filters is they can be cleaned and reused. Simple, easy. For any off-road vehicle, I would suggest buying two. That way you always have one if you need to change it out on the trail or one to run while cleaning and re-oiling the other. I prefer the drop in as opposed to the CAI (cold air intake) dust? mud? water?"
4,Great product,"K&N filter was installed in my 2009 jeep wrangler. Matched the performance gains and slight MPG gains that I had with the CAI I just un-installed. I'm a frequenter buyer here on amazon and was a little disappointed that it took almost 10 days to ship this item especially when it was listed as ""in stock"". Maybe just a fluke with this transaction as most orders ship fairly quickly. Product is 5 stars but transaction only merits 4stars."
4,K&N 33-2364 High Performance Replacement Air Filter,"Easy install on my 2012 Rubicon. At first it appeared that I was getting a little better gas mileage with this filter, but after having it installed for a few months I really can't tell much of a difference compared to a standard paper filter."
4,"Heart pounding riffs, and in your face lyrics.","This cd is an excellent way to be rebellous in todays world.Songs like it's not about me, the world today, and my mind is blind, truely show the wide range of guitar and vocals that Amos has. This cd was a solo project by Craig Amos. He has recently enlisted his brother and daughter to form a band. Currently they are getting ready to go into the studio for a more radio worthy album. It's not about me is a definate must for the rock fans collection. It will be a collectors item, because of being a solo project. Bob Amos, (now lead singer)."
1,buyer beware,"Without any warning from amazon. com, all of these hits are not original recordings. For those who want original recordings, please stay clear from this bomb.I feel like I have been cheated out of my money, and it really makes me hesitant to buy from amazon again."
2,Watch out!,"These are not the original recordings. Pacemakers fans beware that this is not what you think, but the live performances are nice!"
5,Great photos,We gave this as a present to a photography student. She loved it. I loved the full page black & white photographs. The pictures were very interesting.Lisette Model
5,read it...READ IT!,A great book that will make short work of your spare time and really make you think. Eerie events decribed in vivid detail will stay with you long after you finish. Who knows? Maybe you'll relate to one of the characters and learn to conquer your own demons?
4,Where's the sequel???,"Romance with just enough plugs from reality to make it magic! I really like how you set the tone for the chapters with a bit of poetry and ponderance. And to top it all, there is a spiritual message! Definitely not the norm from many authors that I've read who use so much eye popping language and scenarios to keep the reader....and you were able to keep me engaged! News Flash: Ms. Coleman is setting a trend and its a dose of romance growing in the spirit! What a breath of fresh air! And it is definitely a testament to your talent!But, please!!!! Where is the sequel? You've got me hanging on the last page. Please hurry before I turn blue!"
5,"""Love Is In The Air""","First and foremost, I would like to say thank you to Yolanda for writing such a wonderful book. Sugar Rush: Love's Liberation, is a wonderful book that acknowledges a good man in today's society. Not only did I gain some wonderful inside tips on what women like but I also gained a better understanding on what true love is. Thank you."
4,Injected with the sweetest flow of freedom,"I read the book in its entirety a few Sundays ago after church. I tried but I could not put this book down (only took a short nap). I absolutely loved it!!! I cried, I laughed, I reminisced, I connected, I understood and I thanked God. Yolonda's depiction of the Christian love relationship between man and woman was a smile of life from God bringing forth one step at a time the true union that He has for planned for us. Raw and real and I am definitely looking forward to the next project!!!"
4,worth its price used,Enjoyed the turn ranking system and learned how to take turns with some much different lines that I had been using previously.
4,qui tam: in the king's name,"a legal thriller worthy of the name. an age discrimination case evolves into a multi-million dollar whistle-blowing expose. narrative flow is steady if occasionally ponderous. nice balance of trial prep,personal travails and courtroom squirmishes- all fueled by an inescapable desire to root for the good guys."
5,GREAT,Same as the blanket. Great quality. For me the only thing I wish for is that it was a little bigger. But it was a great gift along with the blanket.
1,Broke in 2 months,"Within 2 months the spout broke and the customer service support was poor (out of stock on the spout, refused to contact me when back in stock, refused to replace for free.)"
1,"Trouble, Trouble, Trouble","I received this for a gift. The first one the plastic container broke and the smoothie would spill out when you tried to take the pitcher off. Got a replacement thinking that the first one was the problem. We have had so many spills with the second one, tired of cleaning up the mess because the parts do not want to hold together. More than one piece has fallen apart. I plan to throw away and buy an Oster brand which someone has told me is fantastic."
5,Love it!,"I've had this blender for six months, and I have not had a single problem. I use it for everything- milkshakes, smoothies, frozen coctails- whatever icy cold drinks I can whip up. I like having the drip tray, and the stir stick breaks up air pockets and pushes ice down. I don't find the motor to be any louder than your average blender, and actually the motor is more powerful than my regular blender, so I use this smoothie blender more than my old one."
2,Truly Mediocre blender; Truly disappointing smoothie maker,"I have owned this blender for two years now and will have to replace it due to one of the plastic mixer pieces snapping off, causing it to continually leak. Unfortunately it appears that I have to buy a whole new unit instead of just the pitcher portion.Overall, there were definitely questions of durability over the years as small pieces broke off one by one, but it did tend to blend things.As a blender alone: It was not the most effective blender I have ever seen but neither was it the worst. It was truly mediocre through and through.As a smoothie maker: the mechanism used for the pour spout didn't allow any chunks to pass through, and it never quite seemed to blend well enough to break up those chunks. So as a smoothie maker it was not a good choice.On the good side, the stainless does look nice... although it was a little tall."
2,Leaks leaks leaks,"The second time I used this to make smoothies, the spigot cracked and I had a sticky mess everywhere. Duck tape helped, but not visually appealing. Please, someone, invent a blender with a traditional blender jar and one with a smotthie dispensing one!"
3,Disappointed,A good blender would have worked as well if not better. The only thing that made this close to a smoothie maker was the spout. Big deal! And then that leaked when it worked and wasn't clogged. It didn't crush ice any better than my regular $39 blender. It's heavy and hard to clean with too many pieces to take apart just to lose. I put it away and got out my blender. Don't waste your money just buy a blender with good blades made to crush ice
1,"works great the first few times, then it craps out","we got this blender as a wedding gift. we thought it worked great until it broke about 6 months later. we got another one and thought that the first one was a fluke but then the second one crapped out after using it only a few times. i didn't even have ice in it - only orange juice with a little bit of mango. this machine is definitely not built to last! at first, it looks great with the metal frame but it really is just made of cheap plastic parts.Update: called customer service and they are going to send us another unit. they were very friendly over the phone."
4,"Powerful Motor, Weak Jar","The motor on this blender is so powerful. It crushes ice better than any blender I have tried under $100. I use it at least once a day. But, like many of the other reviewers have stated, the pitcher/jar is poorly constructed plastic. The motor is smply too powerful for it. I have replaced this machine twice. For $19.99 it's a good buy - even if it only lasts a year or so."
2,Smoothie Hell,"I am very disappointed with this appliance. I have had the same problems with it as many others: The carafe will not stay attached to the blade assembly and leaks liquid out of the bottom. The drip tray vibrates and flies all over the place and the appliance is loud. After using it for a few weeks I discovered that two of the three tabs that hold the blade assembly onto the carafe had broken off. Clearly, Villaware needs to listen to their customers and initiate a redesign of this product."
1,awful,Tried this machine yesterday.. very loud.. tin plate slid around and was very noisy.. smoothie didn't come thru the spout.. only tiny drips.. don't recommend this.
1,Do Not Buy this Item unless you like a mess!,"I bought this smoothie machine for it's powerful motor and look of durability. I have gone through 3 Back to Basics machines, buring out the motor or bending the blades of each one. We use them everyday. This machine is a wreck! EVERYTIME I tried to take the blender off of it's base it unscrews and smoothie pours out ALL OVER the place- everytime! It also bounces across the counter, the drain plate vibrates off- everytime. No matter how tight it is screwed together, it leaks or one parts gets stuck in base and the container comes apart. I have bagged this machine and sent it to the trash can and am shopping for something else. I'd rather get a Back to Basics again, if nothing else. Do not throw out your money on this machine."
1,Terrible waste of money,"This is the worst blender I've ever used. Bought it to make smoothies, but it has a hard time grinding frozen things. It never completely chops up frozen fruit, so I always end up sucking down huge hunks of semi-mushy fruit when I try to blend with this thing. Not pleasant. It's also loud and it moves a lot. Sometimes it vibrates so hard the carafe detaches slightly from the base, and when you lift the carafe to pour your drink into a glass you find a fruity puddle in the base's well. I strongly discourage anyone from ever purchasing this horrible thing."
1,What a chore,"This book was a chore to read, too slow, too cluttered and the love interests weren't even interested in each other much less showing any personality. The people never came out of the book they were flat and pathetic. I am an avid reader, and enjoy books that include the supernatural. It is pretty hard to make a vampire as dull and numbing as this one was. If you are interested in something interesting with a twist of the supernatural I would recommend that to read Laurell K. Hamilton or Christine Feehan over this particular author."
2,Bland,"I found this book to be bland in the least. It seemed to drag on forever, then when it finally did end it was so abrupt that you felt like the ending was an afterthought. Not impressed at all."
3,Fan of fantasy romance,"This will be a good book if you are looking for suspense and scary chases through the narrow streets and canals of Venice. However, it's not one of the authors best books. It starts off slow and the story never really forged a strong connection between the two main characters, so I would not call it a romance. The villains never seemed to have a plan, but they were scary and off their rocker most of the time."
2,Don't Bother,"This is the first and last work of this author that I will read. It may have worked had it been cut in half, but I ended up skimming about half way through because scenes seemed to repeating themselves. Towards the end the author switches to Viking times to explain how Ragnor came to be a vampire, then all of a sudden Jordan is taking off for New Orleans where another set of characters is introduced. Maybe this is too harsh, but once you read Laurell K. Hamilton or Charlaine Harris, it's hard to go back."
4,"Starts off slow, but ends with a good ride.","An American in Venice thinks she has witnessed a murder ata contessa's extravagant Carnevale party. Everyone insists thatJordan Riley's imagination ran away with her during an elaboratecharade. Nevertheless, Jordan refuses to back down, and soonsuspects a link between the contessa and several gruesome deaths.The police and even her own cousin think Jordan has becomeunbalanced.Jordan believes the enigmatic Ragnor also witnessed thefirst murder, but he will not admit to attending the party.Ragnor follows Jordan through Venice. Although attracted to him,Jordan cannot tell if he offers protection or a threat.It is fascinating to watch Jordan as her terror escalates.We are swept along in her fear and paranoia as she recognizesthat she is too frightened and exhausted to be a rationalobserver. The story abounds in well-defined secondary characterswho bring Venice and Carnevale to life."
2,Very Disappointed,I loved the first 2 books of this series...But this third book... what a let down.
4,VAMPIRES/VAMPRYES THE FUN IS IN THE IMAGINATION,"I ENJOYED THE BOOK AS I DID WITH THE FIRST 2 ""BENEATH THE BLOOD READ MOON"" AND ""WHEN DARKNESS FALLS"". THOUGH RAGNORS STORY ISN'T CREATIVE ENOUGH FOR SOME I LIKED IT AND I'M GLAD SHE WROTE IT. HE'S PART OF A SERIES OF VAMPIRE BOOKS THAT SHE WROTE AND IS STILL WRITING. I HAVE THEM ALL. I HAVE ALL OF ""SHANNON DRAKE--HEATHER GRAHAM--HEATHER GRAHAM POZZESSERE"" BOOKS AND SOME ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS. I BELIEVE AN AUTHORS INTERPTATION IS WHAT MAKES EACH ""STORY"" DIFFERENT, OR UNIQUE. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GOOD, VAMPIRE BOOK (NOT AT ALL AN ANNE RICE TYPE OF STORY--HERS ARE NOT ROMANCE NOVELS AFTER ALL) ENJOY THESE....OR MAYBE SOME OTHERS---LINDA LAEL MILLER HAS A 4 BOOK SERIES I ADORE. SUSAN SQUIRES HAS A FEW...HANNAH HOWELL...CHRISTINE FEEHAN ETC. EACH OF THESE AUTHORS ADD SOMETHING TO THE VAMPIRE LIFE, LIFELINE OR CREATION. (NOTE: I'VE READ AND RE-READ ANNE RICES' FIRST WAVE AKA: BOOKS 1--5 AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM.)"
2,Just......odd,"I have tried to get through this story. Ragnor is a great character, Raphael is extremely funny and a great character. But, the history on Ragnor and Nari was way too late, and the ""romance"" scenes are too few and far in between. I am starting to wonder if this is a ""Romance"" Novel or a ""Sci-Fi"" Novel with a tiny bit of ""romance"" thrown in. I understand that there is ""Sci-Fi Romance"" but this one was all over the place."
4,Deep Description,"I really liked the descriptive quality of this book. It's a very tangible Venice. I'd say it's like being there, but I've never been. The best I could say about this is that it's one of those books that has parts that will stick with you in your memory. I thought it was well done though I wasn't as impressed by the others by this author."
2,"All I can say at this end of this book is, ""What?""!!","I've enjoyed reading other books by Shannon Drake, but this one was very disappointing. I admit that it was a page turner (I finished the book in one sitting) but there were many confusing editing problems, chapters out of sequence, too many characters introduced late in the story and the ending was so abrupt I was sure Drake must have a continuation in the next book in the series ""Realm of Shadows."" Unfortunately any questions that you might have had about the Jordan - Ragnor storyline are not answered in the next book. I wish I'd read the first two of this series before starting Deep Midnight; I certainly have no intention of continuing to read this Vampire Series."
3,What happened??,"This book was incredibly exciting and suspenseful -- I literally could not put it down -- until the last couple of chapters. What happened here? The last 2 or 3 chapters crammed together a huge number of unlikely events, many that made no sense at all, and then fizzled out to a shallow and hollow ending. I was so disappointed! As for the rest of the book, while the characters are a bit flat, the storyline is rich, captivating, and original. I can only assume that Ms. Drake was struggling to meet a deadline."
3,"Readable, but...","This is my second foray into Shannon Drake's Vampire series. I find them remarkably discombobulated. I find myself going ""huh?"" ""what?"" a lot, and flipping back and forth to see what I missed. Maybe its the fact that I spend 10 months drumming the concept of transitions into the heads of preteens, but Drake's choppy writing style is somewhat grating.Her books also seem to follow a particular formula, and lord knows that gets old pretty quick."
1,SHANNON DRAKE DEEP MIDNIGHT,"I REALIZE I BOUGHT THIS AS A USED BOOK, BUT IT WAS IN REALLY CRUDDY SHAPE AND IT WAS A BOOK FROM A PHOENIX PUBLIC LIBRARY. YUCKY!! I THINK THE CONDITION WAS LISTED AS VERY GOOD, AND IT SURE WASN'T."
3,Ms. Drake has done better...,"'Deep Midnight' is not the story that 'Beneath A Bloodred Moon' and 'When Darkness Falls' are. It felt as though Ms. Drake was under some deadline and had to rush this book--it begins suspensefully enough and the first half of the book is lush in its descriptions of Venice and Carnavale. The ending is anticlimactic -- wiping out a centuries-old enemy shouldn't be that easy..... I also wished to see a little more of the ""old gang.""I was quite bothered by the fact that there were proofreading errors and a chapter that just didn't fit in its place-almost as though it were an editorial blooper. These definitely distracted from the reading experience. I will not hesitate to read more of Ms. Drake's writings. This just wasn't one of her better offerings."
3,disappointed. hope the next book in the series is better.,"I've read the other two books and was excited to see this one hit the shelves. Unfortuantly I was disappointed. Not only did it have little romance and was poorly wrote, but it was also horribly edited. Some parts (the areas of Ragnor's past) were out of order and confusing. In another place (when Jude, Lucian, Sean and Maggie were explaing the situation to Jorden) Lucian had left the room, but out of nowhere joins into the conversation and then a few lines down says he then returned to the room. Also, Jorden says a line that clearly did not belong to her and could only belong to one of the vampires. From reading this book, I get the feeling that it was rushed to meet the intended deadline. I for one would have been happy to wait a little longer and get a better book. Lets hope the next book isn't such a let down."
3,Dissapointing,"After reading the first two books in this series I was very excited about this release. This book does not have the same captivating quality of the other Shannon Drake books. The romance was seriously lacking with the hero even admitting Jordan was not necessarily his true love. Usually on the steamier side, Ms. Drake dissapoints again with only one so-so steamy scene. This felt like more of a history lesson than a romance with a twist."
3,O.K.,The celery taste to these crackers are very strong and by that I mean you had better love celery a lot before you taste them. They don't taste bad its just merely the taste is way to strong but I had some expensive cheese to eat with them and the taste from the crackers overwhelmed the cheese. If you can bear that strong taste and after taste than you may wind up loving these crackers. Good but not for everybody.
2,Far Below OEM Quality/Alignment,"I installed this regulator and aligned it as best as I could to the track, but I can still hear it struggling near the bottom and top of rolling up the window. It will probably last a year before burning out. I wish I would have bought OEM."
2,It Tried,"It isn't often i watch a serial killer or murder mystery movie and not find something redeeming about it or have it at least interest me enough to watch it again in the future. But this one failed miserably. Most of the acting was terrible. I had it figured out early on who the killer was. The only redeeming things in the entire movie are the man playing Paul does some fair acting and so does his main friend. And the detective crying toward the end actually brought tears to my eyes. If gory photos are your thing , this movie has enough to make it seem the most realistic part of the entire movie. It was a good idea but short on acting and delivery. I don't know if this is the fault of the actors , the director or the writer. I would like to see this done by a better cast and crew and see if it redeems the movie. The book , if there is one, is probably decent."
3,"OK, but not as good as the first.","My son enjoyed this book. However, the first book seemed like it was actually a higher reading level and definitely longer. I was a bit disappointed to find that there were no chapters. Since it is a continuation of the first book, definitely worth purchasing to finish the story. However, you probably won't fill many reading requirements with the book."
5,Life in America,"There is a raw component to Woodrell's work that will speak to you. This book is a multi layered read consisting of part crime story, part love story and a generational glimpse of a part of cultural America.Another aspect of this read is the difficulty to change from ones roots and what one could almost call karma or destiny.I won't discuss the plot look elsewhere for that.Highly recommended."
1,"Beware, this has been adulterated","Dr. Dolittle has fallen afoul of the PC police, well before they were so named. This edition is heavily adulterated to maintain political correctness. Unfortunately, you must read the afterword to understand this. A great story, a bad edition."
2,Kindle edition is poorly editted,"The story is cute, but the kindle version of this book has numerous errors. For example, the first sentence of the fifth chapter reads ""Now, for six whole weeks they werit sailing on and on, oyer the rolling sea..."" In some places the 'n's are 'ri's and other weird things like that. It seems that perhaps automatic software was used to convert to an e-book version, but no one bothered to check it, which is kind of annoying since it claims to be ""optimized"" for larger screens, and there are cheaper versions of this book available. There isn't an error on every page, but there are enough that it is distracting."
3,"You may WANT the ""adulterated"" edition","As you read these reviews, be aware that the ""non-PC"" material in the original includes an African begging Dr. Dolittle to make him white, since being black makes him unattractive. While Lofting didn't mean to be hurtful and was simply a product of the world in which he lived, you may feel that you can do better for your children than to send them off into today's world with the notion that white people are more attractive and that black people all wish they were white. If nothing else, the fact that they identify Eddie Murphy with the good doctor may render the ""unadulterated"" version of the book quite strange to them!"
4,Free SF Reader,"A book designed for young kids, in general.A doctor discovers how to talk to his animals, thanks to his rather intelligent parrot. This leads him to giving away the boring old mundane practice of human medicine and going to work on something that is a lot more suited to his pretty unique talents.He ends up in Africa, along with some other adventures."
2,An excellent book but too easy and unexplained!,"Doctor Dolittle is the story of a famous animal doctor from a town called Puddleby-on-the-Marsh. He has the amazing ability to talk with animals. One day, he is asked to go and help monkeys in Africa with a deadly disease. The story continues to unravel into a large, yet unexplained and jumpy adventure. Although we did not understand some of the parts, we enjoyed the book.Younger readers would enjoy it more (Grades 3-4)"
3,"Good value, but I received a 2E not 3E, not very wide.","My son requires a wide cleat which is hard to find. I ordered the 3E Zephz Wide Track Men's listed in Amazon but I received a 2E. When I called Amazon they referred me to the seller, Fogdog. Fogdog told me that the widest they sell is an ""extra-wide"" which is a 2E, not 3E as listed on Amazon.Even for a 2E they are not very wide. But we will make them work by buying them a full-size larger than his feet, and stretching them a bit."
4,getting better,"OK, so they're not as good as our favorite threesome across the pond.But it is still fun to watch, the cars are some that I've certainly been in...and here's to hoping that they'll find their stride and be a part of my viewing for years to come.Admit it, there are times that it all comes together.I love those times!Easily worth buying fer me"
1,Dreadful,"A shame of a show. The hosts are painful to watch and annoying, despite the content being amusing on occasion. Do yourself a favor and just watch the real Top Gear (UK). I honestly wanted to like the series, but they made that impossible."
5,Great dvd,My kiddo loved it! He says the dvd was awesome! He enjoys all the car/driver challenges and comedy between the actors.
2,Perhaps it will improve with age... if it isn't taken off the air before any more seasons are filmed,"Not nearly as funny and endearing as the UK version. Showing the seeing eye dog peeing on the Top Gear emblem on the episode where they try to ""teach"" a blind guy how to drive was just disgusting and very unfunny. Also, when these guys buy an old junker why does no one empty the rubbish out of it before the show is taped? God knows what sorts of things are bouncing around in the old clunkers they buy. The feature is the car, not that the previous owner was some white trash filthy hoarder. Still, this show has potential and should be given the opportunity to find itself. Lots of very popular shows didn't hit their stride until well into their third or fourth seasons."
2,A Poor Imitation,"This is a poor, poor imitation of the UK television show, Top Gear, one of the best shows of all time. I urge you to watch at least one episode of the UK version with its humor, devilish grins, and enthusiasm. Once you have seen the real thing, the USA version just does not hack it."
2,"Redundant, and poorly so.","The US is the last major market that U.K. Top Gear has failed to acheive significant market share in. In an attempt to gain a foothold in the US, the very same production studio created a US specific/dumbed-down version of what is arguably the best car series ever made. Few, if any, critics would argue that the US version of Top Gear is better, let alone comparable, to the UK version. If you have not seen the UK version, you may be able to salvage some enjoyment out of this season. Most who have seen both will declare the UK version far superior. A few people may prefer the US version, but honestly, do yourself a favor and at least check into the UK version."

3,Excellent information and a wonderful pictorial book.,"I have read this book and use it as a ref guide in our work shop. We manufacture tussies. The only wrong thing about this book is it does not have a glossery of where one can purchase the things they would need to make these wonderful tussies. As in WHERE could you purchase the holders? or who makes holders like this? Also where can you purchase special ribbons. and so on. We make these as our job, but for the home garden person who perhaps would like to dabble into this as a gift making idea will not find much in the way of suppliers. Anyone can use lace and doilies, but the real EYECATCHERS are the hand casted resin containers! Too bad they didnt say or give a list of suppliers. Other Than that.... it is a well photographed book."

4,"Paradise Firenze Sheets - Nice Item, Great Value","Very nice sheets. Beautiful texture and style and well-made.I ironed them the first time I washed them but after that I just got them right out of the dryer and smoothed them while folding them. That works.If I had company coming I might or might not iron them but it's not really necessary if pressed smooth while folding.Personally, I think these sheets are a great value.I will purcahse another set in another size."
4,great bargain,"The sheets were everything I expected, and more. My husband likes them; one of his favorite sheet sets.I did make a boo-boo, and bleached them. They didn't hold their color very well when bleached, but they're still comfortable and fit well."
5,Great item and value,They are definitely a good set of sheets for the money. I too experienced a lot of wrinkling after the first wash but I washed them again in cool water and put them on the bed right out of the dryer. I'm only upset that I didnt get free shipping like some others did. But regardless 38.00 was still a good bargain.
2,A great book...,"Zeitlin writes in an overly wordy fashion, but fails to say anything of real importance. The book is occasionally helpful for better understanding the thinker's main works (therefore I had to give it 2 stars instead of 1), however, I empathise the word occasionally. I would sooner watch reruns of the sit com Mamma's Family then re-read this book."
2,Fake flow,"You'd want to like these guys, they obviously contain many appealing elements but it just all sounds overly contrived."
3,Good as a basic guide,"It lists good marks so you can date the pieces and is easy to understand. This is not a history book and doesn't do much for detail. I was able to find similar items and get a general price. My understand is that I will need to get the other books as each volums supposedly has more items. I will purchase the others, too.The worst thing about this book is the binding. The cover came off and I had to hot glue it to keep it together."
2,lefton price guide,I found this price guide to be a bit skimpy. I was not able to find any of my Lefton pieces listed. I was very disappointed. They also could put the listings in better order.
3,An okay book,"The book is not too bad for a paperback price guide. But it seems the idea is to get all of her books. I couldn't find more than one reference to my Lefton collection. I look forward to seeing a whole-extensive book on Lefton China. Maybe writing books on different categories, such as dinnerware, figurines, etc."
5,Great for recovery,"I ran my first marathon, 1/2 marathon and triathlon at 49 and used this product for recovery after every run, it works great."
4,Pricey but good,"Great tasting, but the price is getting cost prohibited. Hard to tell the end result, but fitigue after the work out is less."
5,Endurox R4 Orange,"Good for people doing pretty lengthy workouts, either long continous lifting sessions or 1 hour or more cardio sessions. Tastes pretty good, but pretty high calories compared to some others. Works like a charm though if you take it immediately after you workout."
4,Too Sweet,"Four stars as a compromise... Endurox in general gets five stars, but not this flavor...Endurox is my preferred recovery drink, but not this (fruit punch) flavor. It's much too sugary sweet, enough to upset my stomach after some especially hard workouts. I'll stick to the Lemon-Lime which I find much easier to stomach (and better tasting, too)."
3,Good value but too difficult to mix,"In comparison to the PX90 and Ultragen recovery drinks, this is the least expensive but the hardest to mix. 10 minutes shaking in a water bottle with ice cubes and still clumpy.I would rank them in order of quality:1. Ultragen2. PX903. Endurox R4In Value:1. Ultragen2. Endurox R43. PX90If you can afford it, get the Ultragen. If you can't, get the Endurox. Don't waste your $ on PX90."
3,Not Bad But You Can Get a Better Bang For Your Buck,"I've been running competitively since 1975 and I've drunk just about everything. Just as advertised, Endurox tastes fine and mixes well. I tried it on two separate occasions after 13 and 14 mile runs respectively. I didn't find that the effects on my muscle recovery were any better than Chocolate Milk, which, if you're not aware, has been proved in numerous studies to be one of the best, if not THE best recovery drink there is..and no, I don't work for the dairy industry. Do a little research and you'll see why. So, I'd save my money and buy either chocolate milk (Research has shown organic 1% fat is the best) or a protein shake. Worldwide makes a shake with 35 grams/70% protein 170 calories that you can buy at Trader Joes and [...] sells a good one as well, all for a much lower price and a better recovery."
5,Works for me!,"I hesitate to review nutrition products since their effect is so subjective and prone to placebo effect. However, I am now about halfway through my second 14-serving canister of Chocolate Endurox R4 (come on, if chocolate is available why bother with anything else?) and I am convinced it is helping with my workout (running) recovery. My regimen is Cytomax before and during the workout, Endurox R4 immediately after. Before trying Endurox R4, I had been experimenting with various protein/carb bars. I won't pretend to know why Endurox R4 works better (added Vitamin E perhaps) but it does work better for me. I'm definitely feeling less sore and more able to do it all again the next day, which is the whole point.It mixes easily in a blender bottle, the price is reasonable (even more so with Amazon's subscription deal) and it tastes good."
4,Endurox R4,"I would highly reccomend this product,I use this as a recovery drink after P90X. It replenishes u after a hard workout!"
1,Tastes like soap,I used this product for years and loved it (lemon/lime). But then it started tasting like soap. I thought I had a bad package and bought two more. Dumb. Still tastes like soap.
5,excellent item,This book really helped my daughter with her handwritting. It was suggested by my best friend who is a reading recovery teacher and my daughter's 1st grade teacher. This book can be started as early as pre-k4 or Kindergarten. Practicing with this book has give my daughter confidence in her writting.
1,This is Wrong,"My child has been exposed to this product in school. The letters and numbers are not standard. They are not the proper size and shape. There is no reason to start children out teaching them a non-standard font. This is confusing for our child and at some point, some teacher is going to tell them they are making the letters incorrectly. The uppercase Y is just plain wrong. Other letters are half the normal width - examples - B, D. Some look huge in comparison with the rest - examples - K, H. The number 2 and 6 are misshapen. Children should be taught the correct and standard methods from the beginning. This program is irresponsible."
3,Some what pleased,"I have always been pleased with Monroe products in the past. With this product however, we discovered that it was not designed fit with the OEM top bearing mount and that purchase the of Monroe 901923/901924 Strut-Mate Strut Mounting Kits would also be required. Not an issue other than the information is only available to installers (not even available on the Monroe website). Want to do it right? Buy the mounting kits with these struts from Amazon, after they're installed get your car aligned, and save."
5,Great book for the novice and experienced alike.,"Let me put it this way - I loaned it out to a couple of neighbors and now I am online buying them a copy. First of all it is put together in an easy to understand context. The information can be found in a quick manner. The information that is provided is exactly what we were looking for. It tells about the herb, a little history, how to plant it, any variations that are available, and finally how to use it effectively. So many times I would have to be looking at 3 books to get just such information. The recipes are very useful too. It's great to go to the nursery now - pick out an herb that isn't oregano, basil, parsley, etc. and know exactly how I am going to effectivley use it. This book gave me so many ideas beyond adding the herb to salads or teas."
5,Subaru shine,". this liquid wax is very easy to apply and wipes well. i am using it on my steel silver metallic 2010 Subaru Forester with very good satisfaction. as a surface polymer wax it is somewhat different than paste wax which requires more rubbing and haze wiping. although there is certain a depth of shine that paste wax produces, i am pleased with Turtle Wax Platinum for is protection from the intense Las Vegas sun and apparent durability."
1,B-TRIBE SUAVE SUAVE (IMPORT),"I ordered this one, expecting to find rare extra tracts or re-vamped versions of the old Suave Suave songs, but instead was ripped off by this EXACT REPLICA, under previous title SUAVE SUAVE. There is one extra track, but definitely not worthy of your/my money, when you can simply purchase the original for way less!!!"
4,Good album,Another solid hit for B-Tribe. I got this CD after I listenedSensual Sensualfor a few months. I would agree with other reviewers of B-Tribe that each album is true to it's title. The music definitely has a feel consistent throughout the album. I just don't enjoy it for it as much as other albums I've heard. You will definitely get your money's worth from this disc.
5,Another Great CD,"No matter what song your listening to, or matter the beat - This CD is truly good. I so cannot get enough of it. I listen to it at work with more B-Tribe on my Windows Media player and it is on all day long until I leave and then in my car it is playing as well. This music can really makes me feel like your making love someitmes, and would be perfect for a romantic evening, it makes my day nicer when hearing their music. I just love what they create no matter what. Now I need to get another one for a friend. B-Tribe Totally Rock's to me!!!"
3,A mixed bag,I juts got this CD and I am not impressed at all. This CD has positive feedbacks which in fact determined me buying this CD. I am disappointed. The music on this CD is a mix of sounds that create no response . Not continuos - is nor here or there - just a mix bag of Spanish songs.I usually feel the music emotionally but I don't feel this CD at all. Most of the songs are in Spanish - some of the songs sound very much like the Gipsy Kings - nothing 'suave' about this CD. I have other suave CDs that are much better. In case you care for a honest opinion - keep on looking - don't waist your money - you will most likely listen to this once and forget it
4,Yogalosophy,"For those of us who want benefits of yoga moves and toning exercises without taking ourselves too seriously and without any Eastern religion, this video is lighthearted but a great workout. I enjoy it and believe the exercise is very effective. Hardly any cueing though, so you have to learn to pace yourself if you don't want a crick in your neck from looking at the tv."
3,Too much talk!,"I actually liked the exercises on this video. What I didn't like was the instructors constant inane talking. This might have been ok had the talk been about the poses. However, she mainly talked about how much she loved her body and the fact that she hoped she didn't flash anyone with her tiny little shorts. Because many yoga poses are done without being able to see your tv (i.e. downward dog, plank, etc.) it's extremely hard to follow a yoga instructor that refuses to say what pose is coming next. There is an option on the dvd to practice with music only. I haven't tried this yet but it has to be better than the alternative. My advice? Go with Rodney Yee"
2,I just got this so....,"I have been practicing yoga for over 15 years and at this point in my journey, I consider myself well versed in yoga. I have practiced, at home, with Rodney Yee's dvds in the past and was curious to try Mandy's. I had heard of her through various articles, etc. After fully reviewing the ""video"" first, I thought this would be a good practice.A few problems - Mandy's shorts are too short. I'm not a prude, but it's rather indecent. Her music selection is alright, but not very relaxing. Her pace is too fast. She changes poses without giving enough preparation and there I was in down dog and Mandy was already standing at the top of the mat!!!! Whilst jumping back from mountain to plank, I heard a pop in my knee! I've never heard this before.I'm not crazy about her 'yogalosphy'. Even in her explanation of this self created word, I was confused. I think she's darling, but not the real deal."
4,Yogalosohpy,"I really like this workout because she's casual and doesn't make it so serious, but you're still getting a great workout. :)"
2,Buy Exhale's Core Fusion Yoga Instead!,"I've practiced yoga off & on for about 15 years. I have a wide collection of yoga DVDs from Rodney Yee, Sara Ivanhoe (my personal favorite), Kristen McGee, Suzanne Deason, etc. This is - by far - THE worst yoga DVD I've ever had the displeasure of using. I got it for Christmas, did it once & cannot bring myself to do it again. The cueing is non-existent and she talks WAY too much! I didn't mind her tongue-in-cheek remarks as much as I minded her inattention to the practice itself. If you are looking for an innovative approach to yoga that focuses on muscle tone, I'd highly suggest Exhale's Core Fusion Yoga. I rented that from the library and I was very pleased to get from it what I thought I'd be getting from Yogalosophy. No, no, & no to this DVD!"
4,Good Workout,I enjoyed this workout. It works on flexibility and strength of all your muscle groups. You can control the level of difficulty by adjusting your range of motion.Additional cueing would be helpful for beginners but once you've gone through it a couple of times it's not a problem.
5,Love it,Great workout. Mandy is a good teacher and fun to listen to. Music only queuing doesn't work so well since I have to keep looking at the screen to see when to shift poses.
4,Yogalosophy Works!,This video is a great workout! She breaks it down and makes it fun. You can do the express yoga with music and cueing or just with music. I got real results and am never bored with this workout. Very challenging but doable for me.
2,no direction,"I agree with the above comments. There is not enough direction to her dvd. She moves from one pose to the next without any cues, so you miss a lot of poses unless you spend your entire yoga looking for the tv. Agreed, that she does talk to much too. There is one section I do like - the express yoga. If you are looking for a quick and good workout centered around yoga (but not totally yoga)then the express yoga section is good. And because she does talk to much, after about a week or two you will know the flow enough to switch to the option of just having music play during the express yoga."
2,meh,"My husband bought me this dvd to supplement with my P90X Yoga dvd (great btw) and i was really excited to try it, having read about it in People magazine and discovering she is Jennifer Aniston's instructor. The moves are fine but the directions are too vague. You're constantly sacrificing the pose to look up at the tv and make sure you haven't missed the next pose. There's no count and she doesn't guide you from pose to pose. you never know how long to hold it and when to move on or what to move on to next.I was very disappointed by the way this dvd was put together."
2,Disappointed,I have to say that I was very disappointed with this video. I have been practicing yoga for over 6 years and I was looking to carryout some of my practices with a guided video. Mandy Ingber uses nice flows however when you choose the complete workout she does not describe what pose to move into. So here I am in one pose and she's moved on to the next. It's rather hard to look at the television while you are in downward dog and know that she has moved on to the next pose. Well another video that will sit on my shelf!
2,"OK to watch, but difficult to follow","When i got this DVD, i sat down and watched the whole thing through, so i'd have an idea of what it's about. The next time I watched it, I was ready to work out. Five minutes into it, I realized that she doesn't do a good job narrating what she's doing, so I had to constantly look at the screen. There's a lot of fancy editing and voice over work, but if they just focused on a basic instructional DVD, this could be much better. And she should really keep the banter to a minimum. If I were to do this 3x a week (which i won't, bec i don't like it), her talk about her mantra or how good she looks in her shorts would drive me nuts."
5,Oh my gosh!! GREAT workout!,HOLY COW!! I just got the video and did the 35 minute workout. I am sore in places I didn't even know I had!!! I have only used 1 pilates video in the past because it was the only one that I could find that really worked like I wanted it to. I will now be alternating with this one. I can't imagine what the extended workout is like!! Glad I spent my money on this. Totally worth it!
3,No yoga mentality,"The video is OK. Her suggestions make sense and I will use the video BUT this video is not suitable for people with an ED or who have recovered from one. She makes multiple insensitive comments about the body (thighs should not touch) and praises her own body multiple times. Also, she makes fun of yoga, WTF!?!! I think she has taken beautiful yoga poses and transformed them into dreaded punishments by holding certain poses far longer than is done in regular yoga and by combining them with things like lunges and squats. Yoga works the mind and body. This DVD may get you the great butt this lady brags about but it wont bring you any kind of inner peace. Decent workout video, I use it without the commentary just to avoid listening to this instructor."
2,This Is Not Yoga,"I am so glad that I was able to borrow this from the library instead of buying it. If I had purchased it thinking it was a yoga DVD then I would have returned it. If you use this as a normal workout that has some yoga concepts then you'll be okay, but if you are expecting a yoga workout you will be extremely disappointed. You cannot follow the workout without looking at the screen, and the instructor's constant and inane chatter would become really old after the second or third time. I understand why the DVD has the option to do the workout with just music, but that would make you even more dependent on watching the screen. Thumbs down on this one."
4,Yogalosophy,"I thougtt this was very good. Mandy's style is engaging, fun, and the instruction helpful and clear. The poses she leads you thrrugh are a good workout. I like having time to get into a pose and not rush from pose to pose, as many DVD's do. The first workout is only 35 minutes, which is great. That's about the right time for me. IF I have time for more at that point in time, I'd rather just start another workout than do one long, 55 minute, workout."
4,Yogalosophy...a good addition to my workouts,This workout is great - especially when you are short on time. It's been a good addition to my typical yoga DVD's and strength training.
3,just ok,The moves are nothing new. it's an ok filler for when I can't get to the gym but not that impressive.
3,"ok compilation, but nothing new","this has all the ""air-played"" aae tracks, but doen't come close to ""winterwords"" material-wise,it is a good collection to stick on the stereo if you merely want to hear the commercial best of (though I doubt this has never been what any die-hard aae fans have been about!) but material-wise it does sound a little tired in comparison to their other albums. (ps: i am biased. as a fan of aae material & not just released tracks, i've always found their best music has never been broadcast, but then, that is part of their appeal!)"
2,"Too many characters, too little plot","This book had a multitude of characters, but none of them was developed fully. It was hard to keep the many characters straight. I had to keep referring to the earlier chapters to see who I was reading about. One of the major subplots was left completely unresolved. And the book was extremely preachy. I found myself skipping over a lot of the text to get back to the story. I can't help comparing this book to the Mitford books by Jan Karon, which are also about a small town and its population. Jan Karon is a storyteller. The author of this book is preaching a sermon. If that is what you are looking for, fine. But if you are looking for a good story, I would not choose this book."
5,Mambo Mambo,"I love every song on this CD. Makes me want to learn how to Mambo!! I got the CD very soon after ordering it and it's great to listen to (on my iPod)""happy music"" while I'm riding the commuter bus to work."
4,Good for the price,"This isn't the cheapest stock I've ever used, but it is close. There are a few jagged edges that can be taken care of quickly with a file, and there is one small gap between the trigger guard and the stock on my Mossberg Maverick 88. Let's face it - it's a cheap stock, and for $40 this is an excellent addition to a budget shotgun. It may not be the prettiest stock, but it's comfortable and gets the job done. On the downside it does make access to the slide release difficult on my maverick..."
2,stock is fine but missing necesary parts,"I bought this to replace a pistol grip on my mossberg 500, but they failed to mention that the pistol grip bolt wasn't long enough to attach this stock to the firearm. the stock itself is fine, but a little heads up about the bolt not being included would have been nice."
4,Cheap but works!,"Initially, I did not like this butt stock but the more and more I look at and use the gun, the more I love it. If you're on a budget, this is a great addition to your standard shotgun. I put it on my Remington 870 express and it has held up very well.Fits flush to the gun as though it was the original stock. The only problem that I have with it is the pad on the butt, it's useless. It isn't a rubber pad, it is a hard plastic.All in all it's a great looking and tough stuck but butt stock pad is useless."
2,Don't recommend.,"It looks cool, or would on my 870 tactical. But, I can't get the screws off that hold the recoil pad on. The Phillips head screws are supposed to be an X shape, well they're offset like a swastika. Now that they're rounded off, and also I failed to mention I had to cut slits in the recoil pad to get to the screws, the rubber holes they put on the pad to fit a screwdriver, are about an 1/8"" off and there was no other way.So now I'm stuck with a 40$ useless paperweight."
5,"Easy to hold, easy to floss, sure beats winding floss on fingers","I keep a package of Plackers Dental Flossers at home and another in my shaving kit for overnight trips.The flosser is easy to grip and provides enough floss to get around every tooth. This is the best designed flossers I've found so far. The floss string is durable; I haven't had one break yet. I also like the pick end of the flosser, which I use to hook food particles from behind my teeth.These flossers and Brush Picks (see my Amazon.com review) are a great combination: no cavities found in my last four dental visits."
5,best,After exhaustive cross comparisons I believe Plackers are the best out there by far. Seems like most brands I get through half my teeth and the string breaks! Plackers I will admit I use several times. I know some people will say thats gross but I use it and throw it on my desk or in my dash and keep using it for days till I just throw it out but honestly i could use it a million more times I bet! because the plastic is so tough it does not make the best toothpick on the other end but I have good toothpicks but great flosser is hard to find and this is it.
2,Hilarious!,"This book is hilarious! The grammatical and typographical errors alone are enough to make me giggle, but the rampant plotholes and other storyline inconsistencies are fantastic. This book reads very much like something a caucasian middle class junior high student would write, convincing himself that he's a 'gangsta,' when you know he wouldn't make it on the streets if he were ever to come face-to-face with a real gangster. I definitely recommend this book to someone who needs to know what not to do when writing a book, and I would absolutely recommend this for a good laugh."
3,FINDING HIS GROUND,"May i start by saying i truly love this mans work.Still prefer his later albums though , this ones a bit too jazzy and not enough smoothy for my liking."
3,Cool but if you like Frank Zappa,"This video is cool, but if your the quintessential really like Frank Zappa and want some rare audio, you should checkout [...]."
1,Avoid this re-recording and hold out for the originals.,"There's something very dishonest in hiding the fact that the recordings are in fact re-recordings-you don't find out until the cd packaging comes off and you own it. Worse yet , the re-recordings sound just off enough that they are irritating to listen to.Look for the original versions, I know I will."
4,Warm and Dynamic,"This is a CD I was prepared to dismiss. What I expected was New Age fuzak drivel, but to my surprise, Between the Waters has some musical meat on its bones, as violinist Willie Royal and guitarist Wolfgang ""Lobo"" Fink lead a tight band through 13 original compositions, most with a southwestern flavor. The sound quality is warm and dynamic, very appropriate for the music, which is, yes, warm and dynamic."
2,Looks Nice; Hard To Read,"As with most Seiko watches, this watch is very good looking. It has a nice bracelet and the clasp works well.The narrow, gold colored hour and minute hands blend into the background of the watch face. This makes telling the time at a glance difficult.I use this watch during the daytime and/or in well lit rooms. Forget about trying to read this watch at night."
3,OK - but not that nice,This watch is just OK. Smaller then it looks in pic and very thin. Came looking like it was used or a display model. Seems to keep OK time. Was easy to adjust time and date. I would try to find this watch local and see and feel it. You might be disappointed if you don't. Price is good at $99... Good Luck.
2,Not suitable to me,I found this watch to be a very nice looking and attractive watch. It was difficult to tell the time at a glance because the hour and minute hands didn't stand out well enough against the rest of the items on the face. I had no alternative but to return the watch for a credit. The price was right though.
5,Quallity product is beautiful and affordable,"This watch was ordered as a gift for a very discerning man who has and wears a number of wonderful time pieces. He was so very pleased with this watch due to its beauty, design, and quality. It has a beautiful band and invisible clasp.As the purchaser, I was pleased with the affordability; timely service and packaging. All was top notch. I will shop with you again.MLLS"
2,big heavy clunky,"Big heavy clunky, making it look and feel like a cheap watch, the burling on the sides makes it look tacky too.No local merchant had one for me to see in person as the watch is an older model.It arrived just now and it is in fact very large for a rectangular watch..about 1 1/2"" X almost 1 3/8"".. longer less square than it appears in the photo.Oh! and it is NOT thin at all..in fact THICK..about 3/8""...thicker than watches of this shape usually are.. and many seikos in general....also quite heavy.As far as apparant value goes... I agree, at $99 it's just ""okay"" at that price..features good - styling/finish fair"
2,Too right-brained for me.,"The moral appears to be that we need to step back from the confining routine lives and think about what we really want to do, but this is explained in such an obscure and roundabout way that the point never hits home for me. I found it disappointing, but then I'm a software engineer and as left-brained as they come."
3,"$27 at St. John's Collge Book Store, Annapolis, MD","I have not read this book, but I saw it for sale for $27 new today (April 14, 2009) in the St. John's Collge bookstore in Annapolis, MD."
4,The application of Ki energy in martial arts training,"This is a unique book among martial arts publications to say the least. The author, well known among Shotokan Karate instructors and students, has gone into a subject usually covered by Chinese Tai Chi and Chi Gong instructors who use specific physical exercises to cultivate their ""internal"" energies or Chi ( Ki in Japanese ). The author demonstrates exercises with which to develop control of the Ki and explains how to practice these.It is an interesting subject, but I am not convinced that it works yet. Only time and practice will tell."
1,bags did not fit,i have a kirby sentria and these bags were not the same and did not fit. the cardboard piece on the back did not fit properly around the hose. not compatible.
5,Please read this book,Anyone whose parents have been divorced and is interested in a relationship themselves should read this book.Anyone who loves someone whose parents have been divorced should read this book.Anyone who wishes their parents had gotten a divorce (and lived with the fighting and yelling all their lives) should read this book.I just wish I'd bought the book sooner.
4,Lets Get Jazzy!,"Forget New Orleans there is only one true home of jazz - Ronnie Scotts. An superb compilation of jass classics that the late Ronnie would approve of. Ronnie's influence of course makes on to this excellent value double cd album and if your loooking for another compliation cd then I cant think of a finer example, an album boasting a vast aray of international jazzers!"
3,"I saw the video for ""Hello"" and the song is different...","I saw the video for ""Hello"" on M2 and I was wondering why that version of this song isn't on this cd. It's more hardcore and angry and I liked it. The version on her cd is more hip-hoppish and I don't like it nearly as much. The credits said that the version was on this album - but it isn't. So where is it?!? If you know, please write a review so that I may know."
3,"Not as Strong as ""Haunted""","If you, like myself, purchase this CD because you were knocked out by ""Haunted"" you will probably be disappointed. Although it is not without it's charms and certainly strong musically, ""Hello"" does not rise to the heights of ""Haunted"". It might not be a fair comparison. However I don't know of any album that followed ""Haunted"" so I don't know if the life-changing introspection that imbues it had a lasting effect on Poe's work. Here's hoping."
4,Love it!,"Poe is totally cool. I SO wish she'd come out with a new album. Her songs tell a lot with not many words. ""That Day"" is my fave. The songs on this album are fun to sing along to once you learn them. I think that it could be better by having more tracks on it. It is a great CD, 'nuff said."
3,Rough around the edges,Good lyrics. The music is catchy but often has a few details that detract from it -- not very polished. She has problems hitting some of the notes she sings.
2,Just plain bad.,"How can people like this album. I bought this because I heard that it was good. HA! I thought that it would be all alternative-like - but it wasn't. ""Hello"" sucks, ""Fly Away"" is just an example of Poe trying her best to be like Tori Amos - and it isn't working. ""Choking the Cherry"" is really catchy; ""That Day"", ""Dolphin"", and ""Another World"" are the only other songs that save this CD from getting the lowest rating possible. If she's going to make another album, she shouldn't make it like this one. Please, spare us all."
2,I agree with the person below...,"This album does not deserve higher than two stars. ""Hello"" IS pitiful. I cannot believe that it became a single. ""Trigger-Happy-Jack"" nicely illustrates how occasionally Poe will struggle hitting even the easy notes. (it sucks too). ""Fly Away"" does sound like a ""Tori Amos-wannabe-song"" and all but maybe four of the songs are NOT good at all. ""Choking the Cherry"" and ""Angry Johnny"" are pretty interesting. But don't get too excited... This album honestly just isn't very good."
2,Business Casual,"Poe has a nice voice but that's about it. She sings about pain, anger, and sex with the tone of a 5 year old. Is it all an act? It sure sounds like it. Her lyrics are overwrought with cliches and her melodies are simplistic and trite. This is too bad because she could do a whole lot more with her voice. I'm not surprised that her latest album didn't do all that well. I apologize to all Poe fans, but this album really didn't do it for me. If you are looking for angry women music, I'd try Fiona, PJ, Tori, Liz Phair, Hole, etc. because Poe simply doesn't fit the image she tries to portray."
3,"Promising, but spotty","Listening to Poe's followup Haunted is like hearing an entirely different artist - none of us could be accustomed for an album that great after this, an album that for the most part has forgettable, well-sung pop-r/b tunes. Her quasi-hit singles then, ""Trigger Happy Jack"" and ""Angry Johnny"" haven't aged well (the novelty of the suggestive lyric ""I want to blow you... away"" is long gone), but there are moments of real vocal and artistic inventiveness here. Check ""Dolphin"" a trippy ode to cleverness, or the jazzy ""That Day"" that features mock-coffee house lines like ""Spilled a diet coke on my mother, said hi, what I meant to say is why is your life a joke."" She's a surprisingly vital artist, and although, much of this record is dismissable, a surprising amount isn't."
5,Just another Jedi mind trick...,"While Poe's voice shines gloriously, especially on the more laid-back radio-friendly songs like ""Fly Away"" and ""Beautiful Girl,"" her real strength is in her unusual, intriguing melodies and wickedly snarky lyrics. Attacking topics from emotional abuse to homicidal tendencies, each song becomes intensely personal and gets interpreted differently by every listener. Her fusion of pop, rock, and something like techno creates a style all her own - nobody else takes as many risks, so nobody else stands out as brightly as Poe.I can't recommend this album enough."
5,90s rock at its finest!,This album is a prime example of anything youd hope to find in the 90s rock/alternative/pop scene. Poe mixes in jazzy vibes and some nice scratching to add to the great beat and overall feel of this album.I cant say enough good words...its angry...its honest...its just fantastic.
4,"Poe, please give us another album soon","If you like trippy, jazzy ambient beats, coupled with tracks that rock, you should pick up this CD.I became aware of Poe about 2 years ago when MTV was playing ""Angry Johnny"" on 120 Minutes and the local alt rock station had a remix of ""Hello"" in heavy rotation. I was impressed by both tracks but never made it to the CD shop to pick up the CD.I bought it last week and have not been disappointed at all. I'm listening to it daily. Every track is solid, and the album is amazingly eclectic. Hard, jazzy and dancy at the same time. In addition, Poe's lyrics are poignant and fresh. Her team of songwriters is to be commended. Finally, her voice is heavenly. I especially enjoy female artists, and she is among the best I've heard.Hope she gets around to releasing another album soon."
5,Classic,"I went online looking for a new Poe cd, and unfortunately, there isn't one! But the reason this is classic is that every time I go back to it, it still sounds fresh and new, and I love it. I bought it the second day it came out way back in '95, and I still pop it in my player and sing along. Definately get this cd."
5,"Hello, How Do Reach You?","When I first heard this album, I was unsure as to what I should think. And then I realized, I didn't need to. Poe's infectious beats, melodies, and seductive voice practically fuse with the very tissues of the human brain. With songs such as ""Angry Johnny"" and ""Hello"", it's impossible to not fall in love with Poe's many hooks, and quizzical instrumentation. Even those who find themselves disliking the album at first (which would be me) found themselves less then moments later afraid of putting it down.Poe's ""Hello"" is defintely worth getting aquainted with. Once one does, there is no saying goodbye. An absolutely loveable album."
5,True art. Raw and real.,"Lyrically and musically, Hello is an engaging piece of art. It remains one of my favorite albums. I do have favorite tunes on the album, but I think there's something for everyone, at least for those who enjoy this genre, which is farely dark, but makes thoughtful statements that can't be ignored. It doesn't dig as deeply into setting a mood as groups like Enigma and Delirium, but it uses the atmospheric benefits of unique sounds to get its poetic statements across to the listener. Similar to artists like Portishead, Poe presents a different type of sound not normally shared with the masses."
3,"Hello, Poe.... Stay a While","This is a very impressive debut. The best parts of the albums come at the first half of the album: Hello, Trigger Happy Jack, Choking the Cherry, That Day, Angry Johnny, and Another World. Fingertips is pretty good, and the last track, Fly Away, is unbelievably well-written and performed for a debut album.Way to go, Poe. This CD is more consistently good than her newest album, Haunted, although for all of it sporadic quality, Haunted does contain some better tracks.With many re-listenable tracks(all of those listed) this is money well spent for fans of girl hard-rock."
1,Do Not Purchase This Book!!,"I purchased this book because of the high reviews, and that it was sold at Amazon. Unfortunately, this book is completely anecdotal..there is no research presented to back up her theories. While I am sure this has worked for her and I respect the work she has done with foster children, In the wrong hands or with the wrong interpretation her anecdotal advice could lead to further abuse. It's really too bad she did not partner with someone who has a background in child psychiatry or social work..he or she would have been able to help her create a far more foundational work. One review questioned why the author would need credentials, since she has ""20 years of experience."" Just doing something for twenty years does not make you an expert in the field.. researching, analyzing, reading updated literature and having a full comprehension of what and why a strategy works makes you knowledgeable. Unfortunately this book falls short of providing that."
4,Great book for early intervention...,"I love this book & the author's style. I wish I had read this book before bringing our son into our family. Just being validated through the acknowledgement of all you go through when you parent a child with attachment issues, made this a book worthy of my time. I am not alone & my child isn't like other children. One thing that this book lacks that would have been invaluable is help for the family who adopts an older child in the early-mid teens. Some of the tools that would work with a younger child are near impossible to implement with a teen. Overall, this book was a great read minus all the psychobabble of many of the others of the same genre. Worth it in my book...no pun intended."
2,More Helpful in What NOT To Do.,YUK! What an attitude! Her whole approach to RAD is not in line with the Christianity that I know. I did learn something about RAD from her but what she suggested for how to deal with Rad in your loved one was not acceptable at all.
2,not my favorite.,"I didn't find any answers to my issues in this particular book, I wanted to know more about dealing with some severe behavioral issues beyond consequences. We are a strict, old school style parenting family that went through liberal reward systems and consequences for misguided actions and logic wasn't the answer. I think this would be a better read for a Dr. Spock styled family. Love is definitely a better answer for issues, and anger (as defined elsewhere) being fear based, made a quicker trip to overall peace within the household."
1,"Abusive, At Best","The techniques Nancy recommends are coercive and abusive. If you want strategies that actually work, that actually help a child learn and grow, look into Ross W. Greene's books and videos. You will learn a lot more, and you'll be able to sleep at night knowing you've treated your child with the love and respect he/she deserves as a human being."
1,abusive,All techniques in the book are abusive. As a therapist in this area the book is a nightmare. Parents get into trouble with DHS for using the techniques. She is a dog trainer by trade....and I would not let her near my dog...
3,OK,It was a gift so I don't know first hand how good the book is but I have heard good things from others
5,This book saved my child,"Three years ago, it seems like a lifetime. My son was 4, I was his foster mother and I was fighting to understand what was wrong with him. Having never heard of RAD I stumbled across it when a school counselor friend of my mother heard her describe my sons rages, lies, manipulations, and lengthy history of abuse. Finally I knew what was wrong! Through my own research I found this book and it gave me the strength and knowledge to pull my son through his battle with RAD. It took two years, intense therapy, sleepless nights, and nerves of steel. I can honestly say this book was God sent and without it I would not of adopted my son as he would of not gotten the proper diagnosis and I would of not known how to help him. Thank you Nancy Thomas!"
4,Very Good!!,"The book is really good. My boy does not have RAD but he does not respect authority and book gives really good tips and advice. For those that have babies, the first chapters tells you of the importance of hugging and loving your baby. I adopted my boy at age 4 and found out how many things he lacked as a baby. Now he is with me and I will research as much as I can to help him. Love your kids and discipline is something that all kids need, do not be afraid since parent is the one in charge. Do not give them all they want because you will hurt them. Encourage all parents to read this book."
3,Lab Informatics for Beginners,Pros: Well written even though content if very basic. Concepts are explained without going into too much detail.Good reading for a High school StudentCons: Very over priced...
5,Go KU!!!,This pennant is great. The colors are awesome and it is of good quality. Don't be afraid to order this one!
3,An interesting blast from the past!,"A Carousel of Progress is an intense journey, albeit laced with some humor, which is seen through the eyes of a fourteen year old. For those who can relate to growing up in the seventies, this book provides an interesting look back at the historic relevance of Meredith's emotional journey. Women's roles, at that time, are changing while the protagonist is trying to define who she really is and where she is going. Her mother and step-mother are poor role models. Caught in a turbulent divorce, her sense of self becomes disjointed. Although the book is interesting, I found myself lost in the characters anger and constant bickering. I wanted more; the characters needed more dimension. I enjoyed going back to the early, chaotic days of teenage years in the seventies, but I completed the book wanting more substance!"
5,Utterly believable - funny and touching,My wife suggested I read this book and on the grounds that the novel based on the musings of an LA teenager I was somewhat dubious. I am an english male in my 40's. I was wrong. This book is a joy. The characterisations are really superb and the book is as a result totally believable as well as being funny and touching.Katherine Tanney is a real talent
5,Nicely made hat,I bought this hat for my father to help keep the sun off. He wears it frequently and gets it wet. It seems to be holding up. The sizing was accurate. He even looks good in it.
1,wimpy,Hat is scrawny and flimsy for the price. Bought a Tilley and gave this one to my neighbor's five year old.
4,For Sinatraphiles only,"This book is based on a very interesting premise, Frank Sinatra's FBI files. Unfortunately, it is difficult to convert all the information kept on Sinatra into a readable book. Thus, this book is not one you will sit down with on a Sunday afternoon and read. Its really more of a ""browser"" book. If you are looking for specific information (Frank's mob connections, relationship with JFK, etc.) then it is an excellent resource. Its by no means a biography.I feel that the book is for serious Sinatraphiles like myself. If you have just a passing interest in Sinatra, I'd recommend a biography or something along the lines of ""The Way You Wear Your Hat"" by Bill Zehme. However, if you've devoured book after book on Sinatra and still want more, this will be a valuable addition to your library."
4,A little surprised,"I found this book interesting. Of course, I had heard stories about this for years but did not realize how extensive the investigations had been. Even with some of the names blacked out it was a good read."
2,Don't waste your money,"This comforter started to show signs of wear after the first wash. I followed the washing instructions, and it faded and started tearing at the seams after one wash (I washed right when I got it)."
5,Loved Him As Joseph,"Joseph came first and now Matthew is mature and his sound has changed. I am still playing this work of his so it must be pretty good. I love this man's voice, that voice gets the stars! However I am still planning Ave Maria long past Christmas. I bought all of his music available on Amazon. Ena"
5,Great family movie,We need more family movies like this one! I really enjoyed the story and the dressage shots were well done. I hope this will attract more people to this wonderful sport.
5,Great movie!,It is good to see dressage included in a movie. This movie made me cry several times with its emotional content!
4,The Longshot,This is a heart warming story of a woman and her horse. They face challenges as she journies toward her dream of being a top dressage rider. For the most part this movie is actually technically correct in the riding and handling of the horses - I have used parts in my theory classes with my students. An excellent movie.
3,Sandy's Review,I felt the acting was a bit under standard but still enjoyed the movie. This movie is good for all ages.
4,First Rate Schmaltz,"If the girls in your house like schmaltzy TV movies, we recommend this movie. Our girls loved ""The Long Shot."" It's got pretty music, pretty horses, pretty scenery, and pretty people (except for a nasty villain who gets what he deserves). Our girls laughed and cried in all the right places, and smiled great big smiles at the ending. Cool!"
1,A book that's impossible NOT to put down,"I bought this book hoping to find some juicy tales of Hollywood high-ups running amok, but the price is far too extravagant: wading through pages, if not chapters, of self-absorbed twaddle by this thoroughly uninteresting woman. Only the people mentioned in this book will have the self-interest to read all the way through. If you want to read much more entertaining accounts of Hollywood improprieties, I recommend ""Hit and Run"" or ""Easy Riders & Raging Bulls"" or even the very poorly edited (but enjoyable) ""High Concept""."
1,this is one self-absorbed author.,"this was shallow, poorly written book. the writer has the insight and maturity of a self-absorbed nine-year-old. every paragraph begins with ""I did this"" and ""I saw this person"". the writer has no interest in anyone else but herself. the index tells it all, entries are who sat across the room from her at a restaurant. you'll come away with no insight about anyone except the author. read ""easy rider, raging bull,"" it's a masterpiece compared to this trash."
1,Poorly written about a subject the author has no insight on,"This book is almost impossible to read. There is no logical continuity, names are dropped without identification, and subjects raised and dropped freely. The self absorption of the author is monumental, yet she seems devoid of insights into herself and her world. If the world of Hollywood is as devoid of decency as she portrays, the radical right may in fact be right."
1,Unreadable garbage,"Picked this up in the recycle area of our apartment building, which was where it belonged. It is beyond me how this got a publisher, much less any readers."
1,Too hard to read.,"I read all the time. This book is way too hard to stay interested in. I guess at the time when this book was written it was shocking, because it told hollywood secrets."
2,"Goodbye, Julia","I felt Julia had a huge ego -- like many other Hollywood characters I have met. This pertains especially to the ""Suits,"" who really are quite uncultured. However, Julia died yesterday, so I will not speak ill of the dead. R.I.P., Julia."
3,"oooo not a new yorker, who cares","The book was okay for what it was. Not an original idea, personally I would read the sample pages closely to see if her writing style is what you would like read. She definitely is not beating a dead horse like some writers. I will say there is no prize either....I think it is interesting to read reviews from other people here who happen to be authorities on New York, when they live 1 hour away In New Jersey. What, can't afford Far Hills?This is a great place to come and air grievances, but please the East Coast/West Coast discrimination is very middle aged. Who really cares about the differences? No one I know. Except people who are athorities on what others are thinking.Have a great day! :-) Keep smiling!!"
1,1 star is too high praise for this book,This book is the biggest waste of paper and ink I've ever read. The book purports to be an autobiography; it's actually written in third person and nobody but the author could understand it. She brings up about 3 new people per page and doesn't explain who they are. I wish I had read a biography of the author so I could know what she was talking about!The author rambles unashamedly about her drug use. I think she must have shared some with the editor and publisher of this book.
1,incredibly boring,"Good alternate titles for this book would be ""Look at Me, I'm Self Absorbed"" or ""Drugs Make You Boring.""If you're old enough to have a mild interest in reading very dull anecdotes about people like Al Pacino and Robert Redford -- and you can find some entertainment value in endless pages of ""then I took a Valium, and then I took some cocaine, and then I glimpsed Liza Minelli in the crowd, and then I took half a Valium"" interspersed with more endless pages of ""my mommy wasn't perfect, poor poor me!"" then you might be able to tolerate this book.Otherwise, I don't recommend it."
3,Ahem....,"How does one evaluate something like this, which is rather unprecedented?A blurbed review cited on the cover refers to this as ""the Hollywood Chainsaw Massacre,"" and the description fits. Julia Phillips - R.I.P. - is clearly not a writer, and the clunky prose does drag in places, but I didn't go into this looking for Proust. The dirt she dishes is truly spectacular - moreso for her chutzpah in revealing it all than for any of the actual content.Her description of her drug decline is grueling and lurid, but I suppose the reality was considerably worse, so her communication on this front is vivid and effective. Her descriptions of the behind-the-scenes politics of Hollywood could scare half of today's film students into rethinking their career aspirations. And it's worth it all for the inside details into the making of 'Taxi Driver' and 'Close Encounters.'-David Alston"
2,You'll Never Want To Read This Book Again,"After hearing so much about this book for so long, I was extremely disappointed by the results. The most interesting portion was what a producer goes through to make a movie, but I don't need 500 pages to find that out, especially when approximately 450 pages deal with her drug intake and sexual escapades with a long line of loser boyfriends. I kept reading thinking that sooner or later it would get better. Wrong. One of the most self absorbed books ever written."
4,Telling it like it is...,"Julia Phillips died today of cancer, aged 57.The Los Angeles Times Obituary had this to say, in addition to her history: ""Friends said she was surprisingly sensitive to the criticism. Ten years later, they said, she was pondering whether to respond to negative reviews that appeared on the amazon.com Web site.""Interesting to say the least.If you want further tales of Hollywood woe in the 70's (as well as the superficial good times seemingly had by all the ""beautiful people"" of Hollywood in the ""Golden Age of Cinema"" check out Bob Woodward's book on John Belushi as many of the same names (and some incidents) appear)."
4,Could this have happened?,"I enjoyed this book. It was well-written and realisitic in the area of anorexia and its habits, feelings, and the toll it takes on a family, but I have to wonder how realistic it is in the time frame Terris chose to write it. The author did a wonderful job of getting the reader into the mind of Nell while she was in the depths of anorexia. However, I have to wonder how many people had anorexia at the turn of the century. True, not many people today marry to get their family out of debt, but I just don't think many people had anorexia, especially those struggling to keep food on the table. At least that is what the statistics today tell us"
5,an exeptional novel,this book pulled me in from the first page. I loved it a first rate book about anorexia in terms and language anyone can understand. Evey young girl must read this book. In fact everyone has to read it. Spellbinding!
3,Decent.......,"Not a bad book, but not a great book. Nell's quilt is an example that through out time peoples feelings have stayed the same. I felt kinnda bored through out the book, but it was easy to relate to."
2,Very dark...depressing...questionable,"I found this book very dark and questionable. I was not sure what the message of the author was. I know there was one, but it was depressing."
1,Two Thumbs Down,"I have read good books, and this one is definately not one of them. It was horribly depressing and disgusting. I am apalled that I took my time to finish the book. It just kept getting worse and worse. The ending doesn't really have an ending at all. Would NOT recommend."
5,Read this awsome book,"This wonderful book,is a great read for girls. I recamend any girl that is willing to understand another womens life pieced together in a quilt."
1,Anti everything,"This book was sent to me by a friend. I could barely get through it. The tone of this book is nothing more than anti Bush and completely against the war in Iraq. I have a Marine son who is currently serving his second deployment in Iraq. He has been in a lot of fighting and in some of the worse areas in Iraq. If he believes what we are doing is worth fighting for why should Ms. Lawrence question it? I have a Blue Star Banner in my window too. I love my son and worry about him constantly but this is a volunteer military and my son chose this path for himself. I support him and this mission. I pray that our entire world will be a safer place because of what our president and young people like my son are doing in Iraq. We need to look at the bigger picture and Ms. Lawrence, in my opinion, has her head in the sand."
4,"Quick, What Was Number Four?","This is a series of entertaining and erudite essays, one for each of the classical seven wonders, as well as a discussion of some wonders which didn't make the list, or didn't make the final cut. While some remains of the other six wonders have been recovered in recent centuries, as everyone must know the Great Pyramid is the only one which survives. Curiously, Herodotus wondered at the city of Babylon, and of the wonders he saw in Egypt named the Middle Kingdom complex near Faiyum.This is a nice book for ancient history lovers and students. See also ""The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World: The Great Monuments and How They Were Built"" ed. by Christopher Scarre"
4,the story of mankind,"The Seven Wonders is a great book to introduce anyone to the wonders of the ancient world. I have always been fascinated with history and the technologies of the ancients. This book brings together true architectural wonders. Each of the seven is given its own chapter to fully describe the structure and its history. I was shocked to read that the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was found over 1,800 years after its construction in fairly good shape but was destroyed on purpose! Another oddity was that the Colossus of Rhodes lay where it fell for almost 900 years without anyone ever repairing it. Imagine the Statue of Liberty lying broken in New York for nine centuries and you have a good example for the Colossus which was similar in size and structure. The Seven Wonders is not just the story of seven things but the story of mankind!"
4,Nothing extremely special about it.,"I recently purchased the Hands-Free Desktop Charger and do not love it as much as I thought I would. Although, the charging of the battery is much faster, and it is a bit convenient having it on my desk right next to my computer, people I have talked with while using it say that it isn't very clear when I speak to them using it. The ease of it is wonderful, maybe something is wrong with the one I ordered only. It has saved me a lot of time while on my computer, because even if you have the ear-piece for the phone, it still gets in your way when you need to do a lot of typing and shuffling of papers. If you have room on your desk, it does not get in your way. Buy, and enjoy."
4,Well worth getting,"Jean Toussaint is hard-driving Tenor and Soprano Sax player influenced by Coltrane who played with Art Blakey many years ago. This album which was recorded in August 2001 finds him in high quality company:Mulgrew Miller - PianoRobert Hurst - BassJeff ""Tain"" Watts - DrumsBill Mobley - Trumpet & Flugelhorn (tracks 1,2 & 7)Anga Diaz - Percussion (track 1 & 5)Tracks 1,2,3,5 & 7 are all Toussaints own compositions. 'One for Ronnie' is dedicated to Ronnie Scott. The remaining tracks are Gershwin, Monk and Ann Ronnell's 'Willow weep or me'. This last track is the longest on the album at 12:40 and the band play a very interesting arrangement which alternates its rythmic feel every few choruses and is hypnotic performance.It seems to have gone out of print now, but its well worth getting at the price some marketplace sellers have it on offer at."
3,switch wont last,"Bought one of the a few months ago-stared out great! long lasting battery and bright enough for most occations. Then the switch went intermitent and bad. Coast charges 10 bucks for their warrenty turn around,Hey wait a freaking minute-this thing cost me thirty something bucks for a few months of use,now you guys want another ten bucks for repairs? Lets do the math,save lots of money on batteries,but it still costs ten dollars a month to own it. Bad deal, dont puchase,yes it's made in CHINA."
1,Not work !,"Not work !, If I press the button more and more it well work then it well stop , there is an error , I am sorry to gift this for my brother ."
4,"Bought for one song, and dig them all!","While listening to this album, I was taken back to the days I listened to Lynard Skynard. I could hear a definite influence. This is a must-buy for fans of the old rock-a-billy style of music."
5,Pleasantly surprised!,Charming book. Great read. Pleasantly surprised it had a chapter on Britain '50s Pinup queen Pamela Green and her Dambuster partner Doug Webb.Plus a chapter on the photographer Jean Straker. Well pleased. You can find out more about Pamela Green and Doug on her website.
1,If You Just Read One Book This Year...,"...then you might actually believe the inaccuracies and distortions contained in this book. I only came in possession of it because someone had left it on a plane--and I can see why.I've never read a book written by a T.V. politico before, so I was curious. My primary impression is that this type of material isn't written for critical minds--rather, it is a set of hymns written for the already-faithful.If you are conservative, not terribly educated, and only wish to have your opinions confirmed, then this is definitely for you."
2,"Well, he is a conservative.","The book was very predictable. If you are familiar with Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Laura Ingram, Glenn Beck, and all the other Conservative talk show hosts, then the content of this book should come as no surprise. Sean is a proud biased rightwinger. If it's truth you are after, look elsewhere, if you are interested in cultivating hatred this is the book for you. In the world of Sean Hannity, those who hold differing opinions are labeled as ""Liberal"". While Mr Hannity is most likely a great husband, father, etc.., go elsewhere for political analysis. What do you expect from someone who makes his living demonizing Democrats and Liberals?"
1,Deliver Us from Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,"Bush Continues To Mislead on Job CreationLast month, President Bush released a personally signed reportpromising that his economic plan would create 2.6 million new jobs by2004.(1 When data suggested that this would not be possible, he ""distanced himself"" from the report and ""declined to endorse the jobs estimate""publicly during an Oval Office appearance.(2 Now, with a new jobs report showing that his economic programcontinues to fall short, the president has resorted to outrightdishonesty.(3 Specifically, the president deployed Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to Capitol Hill last week to claim that he never actually signed thereport.She told lawmakers the president ""doesn't sign this report.""Of course you will never hear these Facts coming from a Hannity book."
1,More Mud Wrestling,"More cartoonish arguments from the boy prince of red meat talk radio. Dissenting views are grossly oversimplified, quotes are chopped and out of context, and all who might disagree with Mr. Hannity's ideology are portrayed like the Iron Shiek and other outlandish professional wrestling villains of the 1980s. If someone wants to read this for fun or to pump up their ego, feel free. But anyone who takes this as their main source of news is living in a fantasy. It's a complicated world out there, and we might as well start dealing with it like adults."
5,couldn't put it down,"Sean has done it again. He has taken the battle between good and evil to the forefront. The book lays it all out on the line. He has such great insight into the inner workings of our culture and society, and the liberals all running for president. This book has so encouraged me that President Bush is the commander in chief for our times. Sean outlines all of those reasons, and believe me when you get the facts, you'll be totally amazed at the positions the Liberals take. Totally not in the countrys best interest, but only in their own. Thanks again Sean"
5,Truth is awesome to hear.,Thank you Sean for the time it took you to write this book and the truth. No matter how much criticism you will receive it will all be worth it in the end. Only those that are hard lib's will have a problem with this book. The ones that are open to hear the truth will hear it! THANK YOU!
1,Just listen to the show,"If you just record his program and repeat that program everyday you would get the jist of this book. Just a repeat of his show, which is the same show every day. Boring."
1,"Rush-lite, really lite!","I always thought of Sean Hannity as Rush-lite, a not-very bright echo of Rush Limbaugh. After reading the first twochapters of DELIVER US FROM EVIL, I gotta tell you Sean iseven more lightweight than I thought. Page after page are liberally sprinkled with factual errors, misquotes, exaggerations, and examples of sloppy ""research."" A professor of logical thinking would find this book a treasury ofteachable examples of faulty reasoning. After the scathing reviews of Sean's last book, you might expect a change, a greater effort, but this title is even worse. Unfortunately the rating system allows a ""1,"" not a zero."
1,"Deliver us from Unemployment, Outsourcing and Ignorance",After reading this book - why would anyone want to continue supporting this Failed Administration?Since Bush has been in office.1. Unemployment has skyrocketed.2. Outsourcing has skyrocketed.3. Terrorism in Iraq has skyrocketed.4. American Soldiers deaths have skyrocketed.Do yourself and your neighbor a favor and vote this clown out of office.
1,"Deliver Us from Untalented, Egomaniacal Sean...","Sorry to be rough on you Sean, but, after reading ""Deliver Us From Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism,"" I have to ask - who told you that you could write? That person is not your friend. As with your radio show, the book is filled with empty anecdotes, circular logic and outright lies. And, despite its obvious shortcomings, I stuck it out and read it from cover to cover, hoping for a payout so at least the four hours of my life weren't wasted. That payout never came. Well, at least I can get 75% of the cost back when I sell it used on Amazon.com. So I'm out, what, 4 hours and 4 bucks? Oh well, it could be worse - I could've read your other book, too..."
1,Read something by Bertrand Russell instead,"""The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.""Russell had the perfect sentiment regarding people with so much bluster and bravado. Hannity fits right in - on the radio and in print - with a long list of current ""analysts"" that are better at speaking over people than actually doing RESEARCH on a topic...Hannity and the neo-cons need to wake up and figure out that very few things on the good Earth are as black and white as they portray.Hopefully W. finds that out in November :)"
1,To be evil . . .,"There may be evil here, but I was always taught that we all have a little in ourselves. What I hear from conservative voices is to not look inside, but look away, look to the evil in others. Make yourself feel good. Too bad for you if you buy in."
5,Berkley and Canadians are dumbass's,To think that that idiot is teaching kids and filling their heads with his idiotic liberal bulls*** pisses me off more than his assnine review. Don't listen to the Canadian idiot what does he know? He's canadian for gods sake. The book was good and don't let any moron tell you different.
4,The Truth,"As one who has had a hand in the defeat of a despot, I whole-heartedly agree with the opinions in Mr. Hannity's work. I believe it will ring true, even for the many who have not read it because of their political views. I have encouraged several members of my unit and most of my family to give it a thought. Many of my classmates who are young and disaffected have found a new truth in listening and reading what most view as being unyielding or uncompassionate. It's easy then to let them in on a little secret: Sean IS THE compassionate Conservative! Thanks Mr. Hannity."
5,Deliver us From Evil is right on,"Sean Hannity has done it again. He has suscinctly spelled out the agenda of the effect evil has on the world. From his spellbinding recap of the holocaust through the fall of the Communist regime in the Soviet Union to Ben Lauden and Saddam, he has captured the meaning of evil and how to combat it through the leadership exhibited by the Bush administration. Sean identifies tha fallicy of the Liberal Left wing trying to utilze the appeasment method to ""win over"" the enemy. His book is excellent."
5,DELIVER US FROM EVIL,"WHAT A ""GREAT READ"". HANNITY HAS ONCE AGAIN WRITTEN A BEST SELLER. HE HAS HUMOUR AND BRILLANCE."
1,More Propaganda from an American Traitor,This book is a waste of time. Even with a ghost writer Hannity was not able to come up with anything. God it was so boring. Hannity chose to talk about a president many years ago as a way too avoid talking about the real job Bush has done. This guy is a big joke. All of these radio talking heads are clueless but at least Rush is intelligent and entertaining. Hannity is a lying clueless idiot and bum.
5,VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!!,"I very highly recommend this BEST SELLER book written by Sean Hannity. His first book ""LET FREEDOM RING"" is truly wonderful also.Be sure to read both books and get extras for gifts."
1,Another neocon book without new insight,(...)I feel obligated to tell readers this is just another right-wing neocon propaganda book which is very dangerous for our country. Bush and this country are already hated than Osama-bin-laden because of the kind of policies and reviews expressed in this book. These neocons can't see the writing the wall and the facts & will attack anyone who holds views that are different than their views. They will destroy their character instead of talking about the message.
1,Logic is for dummies,"I read this book to the best of my ability. i found myself unable to disagree with his sound logic and factual arguments. im frustrated as a koolaid drinking liberal that my mind agrees but my emotions disagree with his message. its not about if the message is true, its about what Mr. Clinton tells me to feal. I've invested too much emotionally in the democratic party to let a silly thing like logic and facts swade my opinions!!!"
1,A Letter To Sean Hannity...,"Dear Sean,Thanks for sending me your book ""Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism."" Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon.All my best,BillPS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced."
1,LOL!,"i've read about 90 pages of this complete drivel in two bookstore sittings. I was going to wait till i finished before posting a review, but it's hard to resist responding to the hannity fans who buy this purely laughable bulls@it as fact.so liberals appease terrorists, sean? That's why bush spirited members of THE BIN LADEN FAMILY OUT OF THE COUNTRY AFTER 9/11. that's why bush SENT SAUDI NATIONALS ON FLIGHTS OUT OF THE COUNTRY while the rest of us were grounded. i see, yeah liberals support terrorists.and the selective rewritting of history concerning iran contra IS HYSTERICAL. LOL LOL LOL.sean, god you're hysterical. so glad this is # 1 right now. anyone looking for a hilarious vacation from fact and logic should borrow this from their local library. Pssst, conservatives...that's where books live.not all conservatives of course. true conservatives know sean hannity is a moron liar. only bush devotees and chickenhawks don't."
1,The Biggest Evil That We need to be Delivered from Is Sean Hannity and His Fellow Haters.,"Sean Hannity along with the other worshipers of Hate, Fear and Lies and the ""Lid calling the kettle black"" Society (Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Pat O'Reily, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, people of like mindset who agree with their rantings, John Hagee, Newt Ginrich, etc, etc) are destroying this country (and planet) by spreading their hate and fear for their own selfish insane purposes. Yes People, really look at what they are saying and stop supporting these Jerks who make money from spreading Hate, Lies and Fear. If however, you are one of those who agrees with them, another book that you most likely will enjoy is Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, Im sure you can get a copy of it from someone at your next Hate meeting (worship session), if not buy it here."
1,Same old Right Wing Garbage,I read a friend's copy of this. Hannity is an arrogant right wing blowhard on TV. This book makes him look worse.
1,Deliver Us from Evil,"He tells us what to fear, who to blame but no real solutions. Mr. Hannity, do you really think we are incapable of realizing that all you really care about is MONEY, if we gave you a million dollars I am sure you will change your tune."
1,For those of you who scare easily,This is a great book for those of you who don't read very much. Not too many pages and pretty big print. Sean will tell you that President Bush will keep you safe and warm and that anyone with an opposing point of view is a Communist. He is like the Poor Man's Bill O'Reilly
1,Hannity Hates the French and the Statue of Liberty,"Which leads me to ask, why do you put your mug in the same picture as the French created Statue of Liberty?You can't trick the people Hannity! I remember you and the Republican's wanting to dig up American WWII soldiers and bring them home. The Republican's renamed ""French Fries"" to ""Freedom Fries""? What is that???? Nanny Nanny Boo Boo to the French??? You Republican American hating Bozo's have turned the rest of the world against us!"
1,NAMBLA Members Line up For Blocks to Get This!,"Now that Hannity has gone on the record as a pedofilia apologist and defender of child molestation.""Thank God for Hannity!""-Lee Krock, founder of NAMBLA"
1,Sean Hannity Hates America,"Simply put, if you agree with the sentiments expressed in this book, you hate America. Any person who agrees with Sean ""Pig-Head Idiot"" Hannity lies is unpatriotic and is an agent of Osama Bin Laden.In essence, conservatives hate America. The only way to prove you don't hate America is 1. to not buy this book; and 2. to vote Bush out of office in November."
1,When?,"Are liberals going to stop being polite and intellectual and start putting the word Terrorism next to Conservative on the cover a book that appeals to people who have completely surrendered reason, credible evidence and logic in exchange for arrogant, ill informed hyperbole. Oh wait. You don't find them in the liberal community."
1,Sean utilizes selective history for his hysteria,"Super Big Mouth Sean Hannity, clothed in the flag and ranting Republican spin, does it again in this book: He selects snippets of history to attempt to make his points. I kept having this recurring feeling that he was yelling at me when I read the book. Sean fails to address the real issues:There are no WMDNo Child Left Behind is unfundedWe Are Building an Insurmountable DeficitI could go on and on. Don't buy this book (I didn't ~ I reviewed it at the library), don't give this blow hard a penny of your hard-earned cash."
1,Hannity thinks liberalism is as bad as terrorism.,"The title of this piece of nonsense, ""Deliver Us from Evil -- defeating liberalism and terrorism"" is rather insulting. He's suggesting being ""liberal"" is as bad as being a terrorist. Unbelievable. Don't waste your money on this book filled with lies, distortions, hate, bigotry, intolerance.... and that's just on the cover!"
1,Terrible,Worst material i ever read. It would seem that this guy would get his facts right before he starts to write and bash liberals. He must of been joined by Ann Coulter in preparing this fiction.
2,A True Bush apologist,"i watch fox news time to time at this guy i complete tool. God this and God that. WTF can you grow a backbone and disagree with your buddy RUSH every once in a while, Sean???"
4,Frantic Dems Will Hate This Book,"This book gives a thoughtful analysis of the dangers of liberal naivete. While liberals celebrate the falsehoods, half thoughts, inuendo, carefully-edited video, and sophomoric humor of a slobby Moore, they try to take shots at this very thoughtful, crisply-written text. The easiest way to know if you will find this book worthwhile is to ask youself ""am I a frightened liberal?"" If you truthfully are, then look elsewhere, but don't write a review here. Save the rest of us the drivel and go to a Bill or Hillary book signing instead."
4,Sean being Sean,"The book is a reflection of Sean's daily radio show and point-counterpoint perspective seen on Hannity and Colmes. He views the world from a perspective of absolutes. He doesn't waver. This annoys some people because they believe that everything, including morality, is relative. In fact, any moral relativist would find this book repugnant. Nonetheless, I think that his handling of the issues, as well as his treatment of both Democratic and Republican collegues, to be quite fair given the vast differences in ideology. I don't agree with many of Sean's points, particularly on certain social issues, but I do find his fiscal and foreign policy concepts to be rooted in the kind of reality that one cannot simply bend and shape. No, he's not particularly hip, like, say Al Frankin. He comes across as a little fuddy-duddy, and the title of his book ""Deliver Us From Evil"" smacks of a kind of throwback mentality, but hey, everybody can't be Bill Clinton...and thank God."
1,Mind Vomit,"An illogical and scurrilous screed by an entertainer masquerading as a commentator/journalist. This ""neocon"" garbage needs to be deconstructed for what it truly is: an emergent American neo-fascism. Think for yourself."
1,Wow,"Quite frankly, I would find this book very funny if it wasn't serious. This is probably one of the most ludicrous and badly thought out pieces of political writing that I have read that sold well. Well, actually, there have been a lot worse. Suffice to say that I read about half the book without finding a single chain of thought that wasn't either obvious, obviously wrong, or extremely tenuous. Very nice that he basically hates liberals. Sensational title. Nothing new. If he could back up a single argument with any intelligence, he might have kept his self-respect."
5,What a writer!,"Wow! Just when I didn't think a better book than ""Let Freedom Ring"" could be written, Sean goes and writes this one. He has me hanging on to every word and tearing the pages in anticipation of getting to the next one. (""Turning pages like mad"" as Rush put it). No one in their right mind could say that evil does not exist. Sean points out the evil that does exist and the simple fact that you have a clear cut choice this election-vote for a moral coward who doesn't know where he stands, or vote for a man who has put his re-election on the line for what he feels is right. Again...I highly recommend this book. Sean, you're incredible and a role model to us teenagers!"
1,Grade School Political Science,"I never watch Hannity but I have heard of him so I read through the first few chapters. I begin to notice how simplistic his ideas are and how the book is written on what must be a 6th grade reading level. Now I'm intrigued, I must find out what Sean Hannity's educational background is and just as I suspected, he never went to college and it shows in his writing. If you dropped out of high school or struggled to graduate, this is the book for you. If you are going to be a political analyst the least you could do is be educated."
1,Marketing Genius,"I would like to compliment Hannity for his business acumen. I think he does a great job as a media salesman especially to those who are looking for simplistic leadership. And this book continues his product line in great form. However, this book is so slanted in view and opportunistic in the use of partial truths that is borders on propaganda. This book gets an A for segmented marketing strategy but presents overly simplified logic with a strong spin (to feed his audience). This guy is making ""big coin"" by selling his politics to a targeted audience - conflict of interest? - find a more unbiased source of info if you are looking to edify yourself."
1,sociology prof,"I have been a professor of political sociology for many years. At several eastern univerisites, I teach courses on war and terrorism and am invited to give guest lectures in both Ivy League and government venues. My classes accept nothing and question everything at my behest soas to maintain some sense of intellectual integrity, and above all truth through replicable research. Mr. Hannity's book lacks the academic and scientific foundations that would qualify it for even the most basic class assignment in one of my Introductory classes. It is based upon oppinion and a flare for self-importance. But, I always give my students a chance to redeem themselves by rewriting their failing work. Sean, you could benefit from that policy."
1,This Book is a Waste of Money,"I say that this book is a waste of money not because I disagree with what Sean has to say in it, but because I can get my daily fill of the truth via Hannity on FOX TV and radio. Finally, something that's not obscene and blasphemous on the airwaves! Thank you, Sean!! I love everything you write or say, even if I don't read your book or understand what you're saying!!! SEAN HANNITY RAWKSSSS!!!!!!!!!"
1,Pourrisant !!!,"War is not freedom !Colonialism is not freedom !Worshiping dollar is not freedom !Who is ""us"" ? Speak for yourself Mr. Hannity. To me diversity is freedom. If America is so free, why is there only one language used in the media throughout the land ? If America is for freedom, why is ETA labeled a terrorist orginization by these freedom lovers? And what a creul joke that one of the worst european perephial languages should become the ""international language"". This Hannity is an oppurtunist with nothing intelligent to add anywhere !!! Crève enfoiré Hannity connard !"
1,Extremism Is What's Evil,"This type of extremist, illogical thinking is exactly what has gotten our country in the position its in today. Whether its islamic extremists or the far right/left of our politics, any narrow minded, un-bending, irrational thought is dangerous.This book (scarily) is filled with the above, concentrating onhatemongering rhetoric in an attempt to portray those who don't think as he does as evil.Sadly, it appears as if he really just doesn't get it. ALL extremism is a threat."
5,On the money,"This book is right on the money. I hope all America buys the book, takes it serious, and commits to changing the tide."
5,Dogs don't bark at parked cars.,"It is true. Hannity stirred up the thin skinned libs. It must have taken alot of work and time for the so called publisher from washington to down hannity's book. The difference, however, is that Hannity will cite reference that back up the things he says. I don't see any backing to the so called misprinting.Way to go Sean. Liberals will only get pissed when they are confronted with the truth. I'm convinced of that. Which is one of the reasons Republicans find no need to refrute or 'fight back' to the Libs accusations. There is no substance to any accusation the Libs make."
1,A tragic tome,"Mr. Hannity asked his listeners to review his book on Amazon twice this week, which I guess is acceptable behavior; trolling for reviews is something to be expected of someone who conflates terrorism, despotism, and liberalism in his book's title. I'm not sure precisely HOW terrorism and liberalism are alike--or how despotism and liberalism are alike--nor do I think Mr. Hannity does either. I think he thought it might be clever and ""provocative.""If you've listened to his show any time in the past few years, you will find nothing new here, unless you happened to miss the stolen documents he pretended to scoop the rest of the media with (where ARE those stories, anyhow? The more time passes, the less it looks like a scoop and the more it looks like a felony). And if you've listened to the show, you know he is a blight on public discourse. Rush can be funny and intelligent. Mr. Hannity simpers idiotically."
1,A Must Read,"This book is a ""must read"" for validation of your position if you're a right wing zealot, blinded by ideology, and who never lets facts stand in the way to advance your cause of fostering hate, paranoia and hysteria. Hannity is your poster child, and you're probably one of his fawning dittohead cheerleaders."
4,Liberals are girly men,"It seems to me that liberals are like ostriches who put their head in the sand to pretend scary things don't exist. ""Why can't we just get along?"". I don't know, how about taking a plane ride over to Afghanistan and asking them directly. I'm sure they'll have an answer for you, although it will probably be in the form of a bullet.And let's face facts:The ""right"" is made up of people who have gone through years of school, military service, intelligence, politics, have PhD's, etc etc.The ""left"" is made up of actors who pretend for a living, and a comedian (Al Franken). hmm.Wake up."
1,The worst thing about this author . . .,"is his war mongoring. As another reviewer posted, if he's such a brave warrior, he should be standing on the front lines of the war in Iraq. He should be sweeping for mines. He should expose his family to the kind of danger he proposes to expose those 'enemies' of the US.He's a coward. A big-winded, arrogant chickenhawk. Where are the WMD, Sean???? Huh???? You profess to be a Christain, Sean??? Where are your standards, Sean?? Quit calling for the shedding of innocent blood, Sean!!WWJD, hypocrite????!!!"
1,Deliver Us From Hypocrisy,"It's amazing to me that Hannity presumes to know how a 'liberal' thinks. Not to mention he compares them to 'evil'. Hatemongering in this country is getting old; fast.For those of us who are regular viewers/listeners to his radio & TV shows, Hannity is clearly the most hypocritical man on TV today. If you've listened over time, you see that the rules/standards he held the Democrats to when they were in the White House aren't the same rules he applies to Republicans.Don't waste your money on this trash."
1,Worst book ever read,"How can a person actually believe that everything said and done by conservatives is right and correct and everything by liberals is wrong and incorrect and bad for America. If thats what you believe, you will love this book. I have heard the author say that only people who have not read his book give it 1 star. Well, I have read it, and it stinks. He still believes Bush was right about Iraq despite evidence to the contrary. He uses liberal like its a dirty word. Thank God most of America is middle road and doesnt believe this extreme belief. HOw the man can take Osama and think it applies to Iraq is unreal. Look at the best seller list and 1/2 of the books are anti bush. If you want bias, unsubstantiated, this is the book for you."
5,"Sean, I want to have your love child","I sort of like what this guy has to say in his book. I agree with his assertions for the most part, although alot of what he says bugs me, and I don't always agree with his manner of putting it across to people.But all that is unimportant, because I am physically in love with this man. Good grief, he gives me the chills. I am so paralyzed at the sight of those eyes on the cover, they make my knees turn to twigs. And that absolutely stunning jaw and profile. I would vote for him for president in a second. I can imagine him coming home late from some book signing, me at the door to meet him, get him dinner and help him relax, just be his man in every way. Too bad he probably doesn't share this idea, but hey, a guy can dream, can't he?"
1,The Truth,"How sad. The battle against terrorism and despotism cannot be won by lying to and about Americans who are patriotic but happen to disagree with someone else's views. Mr. Hannity claims to believe in freedom, but believes that our freedoms give him the right to accuse others of lacking commitment to the cause of protecting our nation. Reasonable people may differ. Mr. Hannity chooses not to be reasonable. I suggest that anyone who believes a word Sean Hannity says should read Al Franken's book, Lies and the Lying Liars .... He conclusively proves that Mr. Hannity's commitment to facts is not merely nonexistent, but frightening."
1,Deliver us from Hannity,Mr. Hannity proves himself an arrogant demagogue. It's amazing how pandering to the basest elements in our society can pay off. I guess this book is okay if one is willing to chuck the last 250 years of civilization.
1,The first book I've thrown in the trash in years,"What a waste of time. I so long for the days of 'real men' conservatives like William F. Buckley, who I may not have always agreed with, but admired for his intellectual grasp of situations. Where is a decent voice from the right? Someone who can actually think? Alas, will we be stuck with [guys] like this forever?"
1,"Utter Crap, a Complete Waste of Paper","This guy and his like are driving America into the ground with their devisive, hate filled AM radio and Fox News propaganda.Buying Hannity's book will only help to line his pockets and further the evil agenda of BushCo's corrupt regime."
