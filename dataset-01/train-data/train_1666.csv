3,Meh...,"Looked like good shades online. I ordered the 3-pack of black,silver, and gold and when I first got them, I tried them all on and they were a bit loose and would slide down my nose a little bit but I thought ""I can deal with that,they still look good"". But when I got in the car,put them on and started driving, the sun was right in my face and it felt like I wasn't even wearing them. Good for looks but not much else.On the other hand, the ""Premium Mirror Aviator Sunglasses"" that are on amazon are excellent.If you get them don't choose to buy them from Private Island,go to the right side of the page and select to order them Gravity Trading. Much better shipping and craftsmanship and they're only 30 cents more."
3,"good costume glasses, but thats it.","Fast delivery and good quality for the price, but they are more like costume glasses, not a replacement for everyday driving, biking, etc glasses, but thats just me. My search continues for good looking aviators under $20..."
5,get excited for this sunglass with this price,"last week i just sent this sunglass to my friend as gift.my friend said this sunglass is very good,strong and light. i worry if this stuff is weak, now i do not need to worry any more, my friend like it so much and thank me.i feel happy for this gift.u can think this stuff with this price .it is surprising.i appreciate you to supply this stuff for me. i chose 3 different colour. it is so cool."
1,Terrible design,"This item really deserves no stars. It is a terrible design. Instead of a water tank that holds enough water for several cups of coffee, you have to pour a mug of water into the tank right before you brew. Then the machine brews until it is out of water! This is really goofy. Most mugs will not pour without dripping all over, so it is very messy. Then as far at brewing, sometimes the coffee comes out looking like water, other times it looks like coffee but tastes terrible. This is besides the plastic taste from the plastic pod holder. Target stores have these on clearance for $12.00. Even with the cheap price I took mine back. It is terrible!"
1,Not worth the price!,"This book is literally 6 pages long. It contains three ideas about what is done with teeth...they are made into fairy dust, necklaces, or recycled for new babies. The ideas are presented by a mom, to her daughter, in a very straightforward, ""some people think"" format. Although these are fine ideas, I was under the impression that this book would have many more suggestions to spark a child's imagination. The price, for a 6 page paperback is outrageous! Don't waste your money."
4,Specialized but useful,"The title of the book is slightly misleading. This book covers numerical methods for Chemistry in great details and shows how to implement them in Excel. It could be the foundation of an undergraduate numerical anaysis course for chemistry students or chemical engineering students.I'm a physicist, so I can't comment on the chemical models presented in the book. Still, I learned a lot of things about Excel that I didn't know and it helped me implement customized VBA functions in some of my spreadsheets. In that respect, Chapter 8: Write your own macros, proved very useful. I got something else from the book: use Excel at your own perils. It is great for quickly whipping together a plot, a quick calculation, but it is not a robust numerical calcuation engine. The book advises to declare all variables as double precision - it is one way to alleviate the problem."
3,A Good Book About Something That Should Never Be Done,"It's a good enough book, but the target audience would be better off learning one of the programs that's actually dedicated to scientific data analysis instead of wading through pointless complexity to try to make Excel suitable for the job."
3,Cruel Joke,Please do not use excel for anything serious like curing cancer. This has got to be some kind of cruel joke.
2,Just plain cheap,The lenses are thick and heavy and they rattle. I was hoping being HD brand they would be better quality
2,Be wary of quality!,"I purchased these with hopes of finding a durable set of glasses that offered a clear field of vision. I did not buy these to be a Harley dude.They offer a fairly clear field of vision, although I could see slight waves in the lenses when viewed from a side angle. Also, there's a Harley logo that's molded into the lower left corner of the lenses, which is disappointing and bewildering because I don't want anything printed on the lenses of something I'm supposed to look clearly through! Plus, I personally don't like to pay someone to advertise their brand.After wearing for about two weeks, one of the screws holding the lenses fell out. The glasses were not roughly handled, so that shouldn't have happened. I reinstalled all screws with some thread locking compound, so all should be good there.The metal frame offers more durability than the standard plastic molded jobbers, so that's a bonus. Which they should, for the price.I wouldn't buy these again."
4,Pretty good stuff.,"I'm very pleased with most of the songs. I think Laura Veirs and her crew have something good going. The last song (can't remember title) on the CD is a waste of space. Other than that, the music and lyrics work."
5,"Mellow, rich, and moving- a good find","I received this ""Year of Meteors"" as a premium for becoming a member of the local NPR station. Little did I realize what a gem I had until I listened to it with an open mind- I knew immediately that it was the kind of album I've been wanting to discover in a long time.The layered instruments and harmonic, electronic vibes lend Veirs her rich yet mellow qualities. A guitar often accompanies the fresh, fluid melodies that go remarkably well with her lyrics. The words themselves are descriptive and dreamy, easily conjuring calm images to mind. The songs overall have a unique strangeness that will be refreshing to Indie/Indiepop and singer/songwriter fans. I enjoyed it, and have been listening to several of the tracks over and over again. It's got something special!"
5,near perfect musical journey,"this album blew me away.not since early SUZANNE VEGAor RIKKI LEE JONES have I found myself so enrapturedwith a singer-songwriter like I am with this one.there are nomissteps anywhere on this effort.Laura is expert at sharingher visions with us and her visions have immense depthand beauty.a superbly executed mix of swirling guitars andkeyboards that was obviously given much love and attention.and then--there are her vocals--no Jewel style yodeling orJOAN BEAZ operatic lilts. her SUZANNE VEGA style delivery is perfectly in tune with what she has achieved here.one gets the sense that Laura is capable of much fancier vocal work if she is of a mind to-- she is not.deep,wide,and not to be missed."
5,Perfect!,"High quality bungee cords used to make this cargo net, and the hooks are nice and large to fit over wherever I choose to anchor them on my FZ6. Not to mention the hooks are high quality as well. Love it!"
3,Interesting Casebooks,"This book was required for a political science class I took. I found the text to be mildly interesting. There was an optimistic tone to the book and the techniques outlined were tied to cool examples. One example that particularly stuck out in my mind was an analysis of the Pearl Jam song ""Jeremy"". Since I knew the song, it made the topic much more interesting.I really enjoyed the casebooks. About half the book is dedicated to 6 topics such as school violence, cloning, and the Iraq war. Each casebook is a selection of excellent articles that are very enlightening and worthwhile reading."
2,Poor band and noisy,"It's a good looking watch, the Indiglo illumination works well, and it's accurate. The band is terrible; too heavy & thick and started to fray after a couple months of use making it even more difficult to get on and off. Also, this watch has a loud tick, once a second. I literally can hear the thing when my watch hand is resting on the steering wheel of my car while driving down the highway. Call me high strung, but I don't wear it any more because of this."
3,Loudest watch ever.,"You can hear every second pass on this watch. It keeps accurate time and date but at night it sounds like it is right next to my ear when it is across the room. It is a good size, not too big and not too small, and is nice in the dark but I am not a huge fan of the band. I have skinny wrists and the band makes it sit off center on my wrist sometimes but I planed on making an all leather one before I bought it so its alright with me. I like the brush look on the case, it makes it look good but not too fancy. I like it for its looks and price, but I am not crazy about the band or the loud ticking."
3,"Decent watch, except for one flaw","I bought this watch because it is a smaller watch. I have skinny wrists, and bigger watches look out of place. It's a decent watch, and the build quality seems ok. I had no problems with the band or anything like that. The reason that I returned it is because it is the loudest watch I have ever had. Sitting at my desk at work, all I could hear was tick tick tick. I understand that analog watches are not always silent, but this one is just too loud. I think that it might have something to do with the case echoing the ticking so that it's extra loud.If you don't mind a loud watch or if you'll always be wearing it in a louder environment, it's a perfectly fine watch. But think twice if you'll be wearing it in a quiet environment."
2,Doesn't take a licking,I bought this because I wanted a simple durable analog watch. I had Timex watches as a kid and they never broke. I had one of these for a month and it completely stopped working. The replacement has lasted about 6 months until it stopped working intermittently and the indiglo light stop working all together.
1,Confusing Products,"My brother has an Expedition that is a little larger than a quarter in diameter. I figured this must be ""midsized"" since there is also a 40091 that doesn't say midsize. The T40091 I got seems full size to me and is much larger than my brother's. I see other reviews for a different mid-size model that say they were disapointed the watch was too small...I want the smaller size! Either I'm missing something or Amazon needs to more clearly list the size. Timex puts the model on a sticker which comes off with time (takes a lickin', still tickin', no product ID) so I have no way to tell what model my brother has."
3,A Good Knock Around Watch,"The Timex T40091 is a good knock around watch. It has big numbers for oldsters, like me, whose vision is changing. Other reviews mentioned that the band's eyelets become frayed and this is TRUE. It doesn't take long for the eyelets to start loosening up and the fabric of the band to begin fray around the eyes. After about six weeks this begins to happen with daily wear. Otherwise for about $30 I am happy. I can look at the watch, read time easily even in the dark, and I can keep my way too expensive OMEGA in my dresser drawer for special occasions. This is why I bought the Timex in the first place."
2,Too small,The band is very short compared to other watches I use. The band barely catches the outermost hole and is very stiff and has cracked already. The face does not have as much contrast as I expected
4,Good watch,"Great watch for price. Not fancy , rugged styling. Comfortable everyday watch. Same watch as found in stores for half the price."
1,Photo is not accurate,"It appears in the photo to be black in color on the face and band. It is not. The face is light gray and the band is dark brown. My son liked it anyways, but I was disappointed."
3,This is a Big Hummer,I bought it for my nephew. Initally by looking at the photo i thought it as a small toy. But this is a medium to big one. It almost occupied 10% of the our big suitcase. But that makes it looks rough and tough.You can open the doors and turn the guns.Drawback is that this is manually operated one. So most kids wont prefer on this remote control era. However when this sits in the showcase it srely catches the attention.The price is also very reasonable.
4,Nice Jeep for your 3 3/4 figures,"The ATK jeep is very durable and is a a pretty low price point like most of the Lanard items. the figures fit easily in the door seats, just place them in the seated positon and you are A ok. the pretend guns swivel and there are 2 stations in the rear of the viecle for your guys to run them, Wheels are free rolling the gas can is removable from the rear of the vehicle. It does take some effort to get the Lanard Corps figures currently avaialbe into the rear hatches where they can stand to operate the pretend searchlite other 3 3/4 military figs fit there with no problem"
5,A Goldmine,We really love this cookbook. We're past the big cookbook acquisition phase of earlier years and are picky about any other additions - especially with so much available on the web. This book is WORTH it! In addition to the recipes you get a lot of background/instructional info that is worth buying the book alone. It's a book you'll want to read as well as cook from.
4,One of the only resources available for going grassfed,"This book is a great resource for cooking grass-fed meat. It is built on the premise of low and slow cooking to get great tasting meat. There is also information provided about the grass-fed movement and the health benefits of grass-fed meat. There is a wide variety of recipes including beef, poultry, pork, goat, lamb, rabbit, and more. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there are no pictures whatsoever. I'm a cookbook junkie and I hate it when there are no pictures! Overall, though, I would highly recommend purchasing this book if you're planning on cooking grass-fed meat."
1,It's mediocre at cooling,"I'm not very impressed with this fan. It looks really good, solid and well put together, passing the Form and Fit test. But it flunks the Function test.On it's lower, more quiet setting, it hardly moves much cool air at all. On the higher setting it works much better, except it sounds like an airplane is about to land in the room. Overall, I find that my very old off-brand fan (as in more than 15 years old) works much better and I find myself still relying on the old one instead of this newer Hunter.In summary, I find this fan to be a bust at its job, unless you use it on High, during which time you should plan on not hearing anyone talk while it's running."
3,"hunter oscillating fan, floor model","this is a good fan, not great.I much prefer the desk model I also bought.This fan needed ALOT of assembly, and it is shorter in height than I expected."
1,Bearings? More like gravel!,"I bought these casters to use on a lunmber cart in my garage/workshop. I bought them because I thought that the high profile wheel would deal with grit on the floor pretty well. I can't believe how bad they are. The ""bearings"" are so worthless that the casters physically grind as you spin them- even without any weight on them. Rortaion of the wheel is OK, but spinning the caster on it's axis is terrible. This is a case of you get what you pay for. I'll be buying replacements somewhere else."
4,Good Product,"I'm using a pair of these and a pair ofSteelex D2608 3-Inch 220-Pound Swivel Double Lock Polyurethane Plate Casters on a table I built for my 12"" compound miter saw. They work fine. A good compromise between useful service and cost."
4,"A fan of rock, country etc","I think one of the best CD's from Pussycat.I bought this CD for the track: Teenage Queenie.Most people know Mississippi, Georgie is some of that kind.My broken souvenirs is sensitive music.Hey Joe is country-like and my favorite Teenage Queenie iskind of slow rock. Really varied music."
4,"A decent but incomplete re-do of the 90's ""Gold"" cassette","It's a worthwhile collection of the original dutch cassette, but replaces some of those more memorable selections (Blue Light in My Eyes) with less worthy later selections (Hey, Joe, etc.). And why for a world market do they replace their classic ""Mississippi"" in English with the German version? The English was more popular even in Germany at that time!It also would have been nice to have the CD be remastered from the original studio tapes, but that might be a legal issue so this will have to do."
3,Brake NOT As Pictured,"I chose this caster because of the hefty looking brake button. This picture is NOT accurate. The brake is more like the standard, bent metal brake - not nearly as substantial as the photo shows. Otherwise, it's a standard caster - nothing special."
5,Love these,"I purchased these as an upgrade to replace some plastic castors I bought at Home Depot. These are a huge improvement. They roll and rotate very smoothly. The polyurethane wheels grip beautifully. Finally, the dual locking mechanism works great. Even though these are more expensive than standard castors, I think they are well worth the money."
4,"Good, affordable wheels","These wheels are much better than what I expected. They took screws very well and they're smooth on the ground, no wobbling or rocking from side to side.The rubber is very dense and holds up well on concrete.The brake isn't what's pictured above, the brake is actually steel and rounded on the tip, not flat like in the picture. Also, they are a tiny bit bigger than what you might think, but they aren't bulky. I use these on my Fender Princeton Chorus amp and they don't look too big or awkward. I would buy these again."
2,OK but NOT AS SHOWN,"The casters are good quality, but don't have the very nice locking pedal/lever as shown on amazon but a bare sheet-metal one. In sum not nearly as nice as I was expecting."
3,Not the best I've had,"I ordered these as a substitute for Honey'd Raisin Bran since they were out of stock. The raisins are moist as another review had said. However, that's because they come in a seperate pouch. That means I had to mix them into the flakes, which I found pointless. Plus, I actually like the raisins a little on the chewy side in my raisin bran. The flakes are also too big. I won't be ordering these again."
3,OK OK,This phone worked for me for a couple of months and now it started giving problems. The handst is not responding in the sense that I am not able to hear anything nor make calls. Only thing working now is the answering machine.Good luck if you already bought this product
4,A good book... not only for beginners,"This book gives you a complete overview of all the renewable energies.If you are looking for answers with explanations, this book might be a good option: it is detailed enough, without being too much. The language is always simple, as all technichal books should be.Could be a good book for basic courses on Renewable Energies for engineers. I use it as a reference book."
3,Why?,"""Why, not how"" is accurate, but the point can be amplified.This is NOT a practical text in any way; it is a highly formal, rigorous logical treatise. It does not teach predicate logic, but sets out to formalize this author's particular definition or systematization of it. It may be useful if you're a logician (or play one on TV), and want to know the bases for predicate logic, its scope and limitations, and really mull over each assumption it makes, one by one.Having forked out $30 for it on Amazon, I felt obligated to trudge through it, but I can't really say that it's helped me much. Some of the philosophical points are interesting, but it really wasn't what I was looking for.Really, my 3 stars are generous. For my use it was a 1, and I'm not really qualified to judge it on its own terms. So I waffled."
5,Works great,"I bought three of these to hold our bath towels and a hand towel. Our bath towels are extremely thick and heavy and the hooks manage to ""hold onto the towels"" extremely well. Of course, our heavy robes stay on them too, but their real purpose is for our bath towels. The one I use for a hand towel by the vanity sink also works well. Naturally, a hand towel is not the heft of a bath towel. So, our experience with these robe hooks is very good and we have not experienced the problems of falling towels that some other reviewers have reported."
3,It works.,"Decent, sturdy quality and style. Instructions for mounting are included. US-made. Would like to see matching items available on Amazon."
5,stylin,Durable and modern. Worth the money. Very sturdy. Can be mounted vertically or horizontally.Shipped quickly.Would purchase again. I have the parma faucets as well and I am happy with the entire collection.
4,Great stuff.,"Being in US, I've never even heard of the group Puressence. I actually purchased this CD for the song ""Fire"" which was featured in the final scene of British film ""Killing Time"" which I enjoyed very much. But the rest of the album didn't disappoint either. Great stuff."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Rebellion brewing.Having defected to the side of the rebels, the Black Company's remnants are in hiding to protect the woman who will have the important role of The White Rose.The Third book finds them in a strange dirty place surround by warning guardian stone and flying sky whale type creatures as they plot and plan to come up with a way to stop all sorts of evil sorcerers via the White Rose's anti-magic ability.While the Company and story's style is no longer new, this is still a fine installment."
5,The end of the beginning.,"Hey do you want a fast action book that will sweep you into another world, without all the fairy dust and slow moving plot points of Tolkien? TRY THIS BOOK, Its hot."
4,A good but rushed finish,"Glen Cook's final of the first ""trilogy"" of Black Company novels finishes the story began in ""The Black Company"" and continued to great effect in ""Shadows Linger"". The story reaches its conclusion with some good storytelling and a few surprises, but there were a few things about this installment that disappointed. In particular, details about the role of the Old Father Tree, Tracker and Toadkiller Dog, and the final battle with the Dominator all could have used greater development. Each of these offered interesting twists but the details were too few and potentially worthwhile tangents were touched on all too briefly and largely left unexplored.Despite these issues, it was good to finish the trilogy and Cook has won me over. I'll be looking into the further exploits of his Black Company."
4,Happy music,"This material is joyously performed. Some of the happiest sounding harp playing I've encountered. I mean, I don't have much harp stuff in my vast collection, but if more of it sounded like this, I would.The recording qualities are uneven, but that doesn't keep the material from shining through. Great version of Limehouse Blues. There's a version of Summertime on this that helps me even like this overwrought standard tune (Summertime usually works better for me as an instrumental anyway). Ruth's version swaggers.This album gave me a taste of what could be. I wish I could hear more music interpreted like this."
3,Ok,The Pyramid of Success itself is great but this book...not so much.The book is short and easy to read but that might be the bad part. I have read most of the book but probably won't finish it. I have gained almost nothing from reading the book. Normally I take lots of notes when I read but this book just doesn't give me much of anything I feel is important enough to write down.I haven't read the other books by John Wooden but my guess is there much better. Maybe I expected too much from this book. If I were you i'd try his other books. To me this book just doesn't make my mind think like other books have.
1,Coach Wooden's Pyramid of Success Playbook,This book was not a typical softback size. It was a very small book and I was very dissapointed.
1,cheap but worthless,"I wrote this printer something like a year ago.I bought it because it was cheap... but after a year, I have to manually feed each and every page, and everytime it gets worse.I am now looking to buy another printer, and hope that this next one does not give me so much troubles.S."
3,Satisfy with Printer,"We bought this printer last December at a discounted price from Best Buy, and it generally has worked out well. Lately, it did have a feeding problem. After looking on Amazon and the web for various solutions, the one that I like is simply cleaning the rough rubber band on the roller inside the printer with a moist cloth. This worked for us."
4,Good little workhorse,"I highly recommend this printer for anyone looking for a good BW laser printer. It prints very fast & setup's a breeze. There have been some other reviews concerning problems with the paper feed, where the little rubber roller in the printer (it can be easily viewed when looking straight through the paper tray) stops picking up paper, causing the printer not to print. This is because the oils placed on the rubber to aid it in picking up paper have either been rubbed off or have evaporated. This problem can be easily fixed by rubbing a cotton ball soaked with 70% isopropyl alcohol (just your plain old rubbing alcohol) on the rubber roller. This will solve that issue."
1,paper feed problems on pickup,"Had paper feed problems after about 1,500 pgs. Pickup roller won't pickup paper properly. No obstruction at all. Totally screwed. Tech support was good though."
4,Good as a backup printer,"I chose this printer to be a backup for my color printer. I figured for about the price of 6 new color cartridges [...] I could just get a cheap laser printer to handle homework, directions, proofing, etc. As a money saver, it's been good. But there's no way I got 3000 copies out of my first toner cartridge (more like 1000). So far, so good, but I'd probably go a little higher end if this was my primary printer. Oh, and a genuine Samsung replacement cartidge costs almost as much as the printer."
1,The worst printer ever?,"Here it is, short and sweet. Three weeks after I purchased this printer new it was down with a fuser malfuncion. I exchanged the printer via Samsung customer service for a ""refurbished"" unit, and I STILL have a printer that does not work. Eightie dollars, and far too much of my time flushed down the drain, plain and simple. PLEASE avoid this printer AT ALL COST! I will NEVER purchase another Samsung product, Canon is the brand to purchase if you are looking for a reliable printer."
2,maintenance,"Paper pick-up requires constant cleaning/rejuvenation. Otherwise prints flawlessly and in good quality. Cleaning is an easy process, and if you are willing to clean every 100 pages or so then I would give it 4 stars."
2,Worked for about a year,"I loved this printer until it broke. First it started jamming the paper. I needed to disassemble it with a screwdriver to remove the paper. Eventually it quit working completely. It was cheap, and I wanted to like it, but it did not last.I just bought a Brother HL-2140 which seems to have better reviews."
4,Samsung Laser Provides Real Value,The printer was easy to setup and inexpensive as well. Good fast output. The only thing it was missing was the USB cable to connect it to the computer. If that had been included I would have rated this a 5.
5,workhorse,Am now using my second Samsung ML-2510. Wore the first one out printing out thousands of pages of articles when I was a political science graduate student.This printer has been incredibly reliable. Never had a jamming problem - that I didn't cause.Print quality is excellent. I shake the toner to get lots of more printing when indication the toner is getting low.I use LD replacement toners. They are half the price of Samsung cartridges and work just as well.I totally recommend this printer.
3,Ehhhhh,"Prints well, prints fast, but jams often & for no reason when using certain paper reams(even fresh out of the package, so no humidity issues). Annoying to use during its temper tantrums, unremarkable (aside from low cost) otherwise."
4,good product except for mac users,it doesn't work on Intel based macs. I tried a lot and Guten print apps(open source print driver) as well. but it's not working. no idea about OS 10.5 Leopard's compatibility. I emailed Smasung many times but they do not reply...anyways printer itself...it is great product. cheap and durable. design is also good.
1,Could not print a single page,"This printer started jamming the very first time, and I could not even get a single page to print successfully. The software is cheap, dated and takes forever to install and must be installed (per Samsung). After several hours of frustration and wrestling with the thing, I returned it"
1,Smoke When Printing!!! I am nauseous now!,I just bought this printer for my research work at Harvard and was stoked because it printed much faster than my inkjet. But then as I was printing a document I noticed a puff of smoke come out and now my room stinks. Is this thing safe?
1,I'm going to destroy this thing Office Space-style,"I bought this printer a few months ago from another online retailer as a factory refurbished item (possibly my first mistake). The first 10 or so pages printed with no problems -- the printout looked good, and it was fast. That's when the problems started -- The printer will no longer scoop up paper from its tray... it tries a couple of times, then starts flashing like a paper jam. If I have a lot of patience, I can force it to take up a piece of paper through the manual feed area, but it's extremely frustrating to deal with. I guess I learned my lesson that you get what you pay for. Stay away from this printer at all costs!"
1,Cheap korean gunk!,"Bought the first one a year ago. Every time I turn it on my computer would reboot by itself, lights start flashing. After 5~6 times my UPS got burned by it. I think the printer draw unusually large amount of current, which caused interruption in the electric system. A few days ago I bought the 2nd one in the hope the first one was a lemo. Guess what? The 2nd one does exactly the same thing! I have a Samsung LCD TV which also has tons of issues. I swear this is the last Korean made item I ever buy!"
3,Beware Intel Mac owners,"I notice that another fellow said it wouldn't work with Intel Macs (at least, his). I suspect that is my problem. I would love to hear from any Intel Mac owner who has this printer and has printed with it. Otherwise, I do *NOT* recommend it for Intel Macs.I have done everything humanly possible to make sure the installation was done right (but c'mon--Macs and printers usually are almost brainless in their compatibility), including downloading the latest driver from Samsung. However, the printer absolutely will not print a job from the computer. It prints its DEMO sheet perfectly, so everything in the printer itself DOES work. But it won't print from my MacBook Pro, and I highly suspect that the Samsung drivers, at least this one, are NOT compatible with Intel Macs. Hope I'm wrong..."
2,Paper jams all the time!,This piece of junk always has paper jams! Also had a bunch of other tech problems with it. Do not buy it.
3,I think there might be a solution,"i had the same problem after i switched out the toner it would take me about 10 trys to get out 2-3 sheets i read on one of these reviews to clean it and so i did it wasnt printing before i cleaned it and as soon as i did it started to work just fine. i used an air can and just a moist paper towel i dont know if thats ok to use but thats what i used, and now its printing just fine."
2,"Started great, now no paper feed! (less than a year old)","This printer is great, when it works. The print is fast and good quality. After 10 months of owning the printer it will no longer feed the paper. I have tried going to different types of paper and using more and less of it also cleaning off the wheels that feed it, no luck with it. Right now it usually takes at least 10 tries for the printer to grab a page. Once the printer has the paper it still prints fine.Overall good for a couple of months, but now pretty much useless"
3,Great while it lasts,"This little guy will make your dreams come true, then implode. It worked fine for the first toner cartridge (which dried up a bit on the early side), now has so many paper-feed problems I only use this heap as a last resort.My advice: if you can get an insane deal/rebate (talking 30 clams here, not 50), go for it. Use it for the life of toner cartridge and go your separate ways. From there, use it for recycling credit when you buy your next one."
5,Great the Price,Very pleased with printer. I can accomplish what I need to with this simple to use printer.
4,Great printer if you're not running OSX 10.5+,"I got this printer over a year ago, and loved it. Quick, easy, never jammed, tonner lasted forever, etc.... Oh, and cheep ($65).Then, I upgraded to OSX 10.5, and the printer wouldn't work on my wireless network. Major letdown. I jumped through many hoops to get it to work, but it only prints via USB now."
1,Major Paper Feed Issues,"I am having the same paper feed issues as some of the other reviewers and it has been only a year (I print very occasionally). It worked great at first and I was really pleased it printed amazingly fast and I thought it was perfect for my needs. But now it is impossible to use, extremely unreliable, I never know when it will work or not. Paper feed stopped working and it does not matter what I do I can't get it working again."
1,Printer Jams from Day 1,"I originally ordered the product for my daughter. After setting it up, it jammed the first try I made a printout. Sad to say, not even one printout came out. I have had several printers already, but this one really sucks. Worse, the store I bought it from will not allow a refund once you already opened the box. Worse more is that the ink toner I bought with the printer cannot be returned unless I prepaid the shipping cost. Avoid this printer at all cost."
1,Power hungry monster,"I purchased this printer as a replacement for an HP laserjet 1200 which is getting old. I know that laser printers are notorious for drawing a lot of current but like other previous posters I had the dimming lights and even though I did not have the printer connected to my UPS, the UPS indicated that an event had caused a drop in voltage. Also, I too experienced problems with envelopes. Very unprofessional reults. Every envelope printed came out wrinkled. Stay away from this printer. It may be cheap but spend a few more dollars and get a quality unit."
5,New and great printer.,No complaints. Have had for about 1.5 months. was able to hook up printer to router to print wirelessly.
1,Paper feeder breaks,"I have had this printer for a year and a half. At about a year I started having the same paper feeder problems as others. It tries twice and cannot pick up the paper for some reason, then gives up and signals a paper jam. You have to pull out all the paper and then put it back in to restart it. It is super annoying and I worry that the motor for the paper feeder is going to burn out, since it is struggling each time, twice, to pick up the paper."
2,Worked great until it started smoking and smelled burnt,"Great, fast, cheap printer but a few months in it's starting to kick out thick white smoke when it prints. As I'd rather not burn down my house I'm buying a new printer. =("
3,I wouldn't recommend this printer,Printed great but died after a year. This was my second one of these models and both crapped out. Guess I'll try another brand this time.
1,Piece of junk,"I had this printer for 20 months and used it very rarely. Even before the starter toner cartridge ran out, the printer died. One day it just stopped printing, the thing got very, very hot (burned my fingers) and died.I'll never buy another Samsung printer."
1,Very Bad Printer,"This is based on having used two of these printers so this isn't a lemon issue, IMO.Jams constantly with print graphics. Really the worst printer I have ever used."
1,"Horrible Print Quality, Should NOT have been Re-sold","The print quality on this printer is horrible, the ink smears even though I have put 2 different cartridges. I had no way of calling or getting a hold of the seller to try and remedy this. I would have just purchased a new printer if I new it was gonna be this bad."
1,Toner does not last,"I had this printer a month and the toner ran out after 200 pages. OK figured it was a starter cartridge and went out and blue $80 on a new cartridge and it goes blank after 200 pages. I am not printing anyting other then standard text documents. No figures or graphics. The Toner monitor always says I am low on toner even right after insalling a new cartridge. I bought this on sale and with rebates, the toner cartridge costs twice as much as the printer. I am just going to scrap the brinter and go with the Brother 2140 which is cheaper then a new Samsung cartridge."
1,faulty drivers,"Based on reviews, I purchased this printer from Staples; after [..], it came to [..]. Great price, but now I see why....My computer is running XP Media Center Edition. The software that came with the computer would not finish loading. Went to the web site with no better luck. I'm no novice with computers. Seems like a software compatibility issue to me. I'm returning it."
2,"misrepresented, came damaged but functional","i am a fan of this printer, now no longer made, and had a few toner cartidges on the shelf....the printer was advertised as refurbished; it came cracked and missing parts, but still printed. i like this printer, and the breaks were where my previous copies of this printer were broken, thus a design weakness;i got a small money adjustment, by phone, no problem, so be prepared.biught via amazon, i am asked to say"
1,No Quality Control on Samsung ML-2510,"I bought this printer in October 2009 from OfficeMax and without printing a single page it started giving me the error ""Please Close the side cover"" and ultimately I had to return that printer because that comes with broken sensor. I got the replaced one and it was working fine until recently it is dead. Complete dead with no power light!!! I made sure the power cord is fine and tried everything but it looks that it is burned from inside. Keep in mind I was not printing more than 10-15 pages per week."
2,Not one of the best printers I've ever owned,"I have owned this printer for about 6 months. 90 % of what I print out are blank crossword puzzles, with occasional text documents. The original cartridge ran out after printing 600 pages. It was supposed to last for about 1000 pages. One of the reasons for this is that you can only print ""normal"" or ""best"" quality. Other printers that I have owned would allow you to print using a ""draft"" quality. Perfect for puzzles or documents for casual personal use. The normal quality was very good, but uses too much toner. Considering the replacement cost for a toner cartridge, I would not recommend this printer. You can do better. By the way, when I did replace the toner I used a generic cartridge. It works ok, but the quality of the printing leaves a lot to be desired. So if you buy this printer, when the original toner runs out, you will probably have to spring for an expensive Samsung cartridge if your printing has to be of decent quality."
5,Fantastic Entry Laser!,"I bought this on recommendation from my brother who has the ML-2010 model and absolutely loves it. This one is equally fantastic! I have had no problems with it. The paper doesn't curl like previous cheap laser printers I have used, and it prints very fast (about 5-10 seconds until first page comes out and then much faster after that). The relatively small footprint is also nice.I highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a personal laser printer!"
1,ML-2510,"Great printer . . . for a while. Now, 6 mos. later it won't feed paper & just jams. Don't buy this unless you like trying to fix a printer."
2,6 hours (1/2 a TV season) for $122,"Boy what a rip-off! 12 half-hour episodes, totaling less than 6 hours, half of a normal television season, for $122!!!!This is even worse than the original $150 Paramount had charged for the Star Trek DVD seasons, those were complete 25 hour long episodes.Save your money & buy these affordable Peanuts decade sets:Peanuts: 1960's Collection (A Charlie Brown Christmas / Charlie Brown's All-Stars / It's the Great Pumpkin / You're in Love / He's Your Dog / It Was a Short Summer)Peanuts: 1970's Collection, Vol. 1 (It's a Mystery Charlie Brown / Play It Again / A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving / It's the Easter Beagle / There's No Time for Love / You're Not Elected)Peanuts: 1970's Collection, Vol. 2 (Be My Valentine Charlie Brown / You're a Good Sport / It's Arbor Day / What a Nightmare / It's Your First Kiss / You're the Greatest)"

5,Yes - The Latvian Gambit Lives!,"Having read the book ""The Latvian Gambit Lives!"" l was very impressed with the amazing depth of research and analysis Kosten has put into this book. I found it very readable and shows the reader how to play this fighting defence with a capital ""F"".lt is one of the ""must have"" books on this gambit!"
5,desire doll,She is beautifulshe was very squished in boxneeds steamed after openinglooks like I Imaged her - husband bought me for my birthday
3,Social Cognitive Learning Theory,"Of the two books, Social Learning Theory and Social Foundations of Thought and Action, I found Social Learning Theory to be written in a more conversational tone. It was easier to read and held a lot of the same information. However, Social Foundations is a remarkably in-depth analysis of various theories of observation, modeling, and learning styles. It holds elements of personal development, teaching, and environmental influences such as the home and school. There is a fountain of useful information that can be used to fully understand how people learn. Learning and Cognitive were used interchangeably due to the abuse of the phrase social learning theory. Don't let it deter you."
3,A crumb of the cookie...,"This is a sick live album, I like Ace but not this, they did more than that on stage and you know it too. This would have 5 stars if it was the whole thing like the KISS alives, OR any other band's live album. This is too boring of an album to even buy, it's got good sound and all, but the new song is the only reason worth listening. The rest is just a piece of a tour. Frehley could have done a LOT better! L.Graven"
4,"wah,wah,wah","get off ace's back,all of you.this album was a contractual obligation.the sound quality is excellent,AND a new song by ace.i wish it were longer too, but oh well.maybe next time."
5,didn't use it much,"This was required for my adult health class, and even though I didn't use it much I found it to be informative."
4,Good practice book,"I bought this to help some medical students who were struggling with ECG basics. I feel like it may be a bit too detailed in some of the interpretations, but overall, I was very impressed with the quality and variety of the strips. My students all passed their ECG exam."
4,A good practice book,"Quite extensive workbook about hearth arrhythmias. In each case chapter starts with short theory and than examples of charts for the particular arrhythmias and than you get a chance to practice yourself with number of charts, answers in the back with explanations. It is a good practice book."
4,nice bass,"I used to play a p-bass but by the end of the gig my back would be sore. I bought this bass to give my back a break on a pretty merciless gigging schedule. I like almost everything about it with tbe exception of two things.1. The db tuner doesn't work as reliably as i would like, But i don't use it much so it's not as big a deal to me as it could be.2. Steinberger strings are proprietary with a ball on each end. I normally use elixir strings because they sound great longer, but that isn't an option on this guitar. I've seen a locking nut you can buy and install, but have not tried it.Overall i like and would recommend the bass, but i think it could be a little better."
2,"Definitely not ""Adult"" size.",Too small for an adult's head. They either shipped the wrong one or it's just too small. Would be good for a child.
4,Remembering old Days,"I used to sit with this book in the library for hours on end. I just loved the cross sections and the ""where's Waldo"" type games."
5,God in the Dark,"Lucie Shaw takes us into the bottomless pit of despair in the loss of a loved one...and helps us find the hand of God who lifts us out again. It's a great read...I've shared it with many, many folks since it was first released. This one was ordered for a friend too."
1,Music,I received an email from the seller stating he could not locate the cassette ( I wasn't aware it was a cassette to start with....I thought it was a CD)Anyway the charge was deducted from my account BUT I never received a refund.I guess I paid for shipping on something I was never going to get!!I would NOT recommend buying from this seller.
4,a woman at war,"This film relates a true story about a woman ,and shows fhe real situation that nexisted at the time.It 's not like some of the pictures tht were made in recent years by people who have no idea of what the situation was then,and what some people had to do to survive.It was not always a streight road."
2,ok,this bag was ok for anyone taking 2 or less classes because after a week my straps burst and started to undone
4,Inside Look,"Barietta lets us into the inner circle outside Reagan's 'kitchen cabinet'. He paints a picture of Reagan that allows one to understand the essence of the man; his connection with the individual, and as such, the people. The author's allegiance to the President does not cloud the reality of the relationship between these two men. Despite the professional connection, Reagan had a way, I summize, to bridge that barrier and maintain a bond that is clear through the author's typewritten words."
5,Great casters,I have been using these casters for years. I have them on mobile machine bases and they have not let me down yet. I like the double locking position feature. I lube the locking mechanism when they get sticky and they work very smooth after that. Great product for the price.
5,Smooooooth,"I used these wheels under an equipment cabinet in the garage. The floor is not level and there are cracks. I had tried smaller wheels but kept getting stuck in the cracks. Of the four wheels used, two had the swivel double lock. This truely works. Set the locks and the equipment stays put (wheel locked AND swivel locked) even when pushing from the side when using the equipment on the cabinet. When unlocked I can push the equipment around like I am dancing with it! In short, good product, quality construction, rolls well, locks well. Works far better than my first wife!"
2,1 of 4 failed,I mounted these on a wooden work table. They initially loved them as they are easily set and released and are rock solid. Unfortunately one of the lock mechanisms failed after a couple of months. They design seems pretty flimsy. I will follow up on this review after a few more months.
3,OK for Some Applications,"Casters did not come with nuts (M12). Once mounted, the casters performed fine for moving, but when locked, there is a lot of slop in them. The slop would be ok form some applications, but for a router table I didn't want any movement."
3,Image incorrect as of 08/12/2010,You are showing a stem caster but description is detailing it as a plate caster
1,Don't buy,These casters do not come with a nut to install for use. That's because the problem is the size of the thread is not standard or metric!!! I cannot find a nut anywhere to screw on to these pieces of crap!
4,ok but need to be supplied with nuts.,"The swivel post was a a little too big for my scroll saw table and jet lathe so i had to enlarge the holes in stand. I'm thinking i should of got something a little more heavier for my lathe but, i don't move it around much except to clean. They work alright for my band saw"
4,Easyroller,I am fully satisfied. The wheels roll well and the brake holds. The brake lever is easy and positive to manipulate.
1,Funny Book,It was a funny book. I enjoyed it! I passed it on to my friends. We all need a good laugh now and then. This book will make you laugh out loud!!!
2,Not much fun,"Having read the three earlier reviews I can only wonder how different the tastes and likings of people are. Two persons gave five stars, one gave one and I am giving two just because of the funny faces of the author on the back cover of the book. She might be an excellent presenter of stories. The stories reflect life and maybe true, but I did not find them funny. The book has positive values and gives some good lessons, but my review reflects the wrong promises of the front cover. The couple on the cover is just about exhausted about laughter. They may have their own jokes to laugh, but not those from the book. This review makes me sad, because it is terribly difficult to write a really funny book."
1,Hardware and Package inspection is terrible!!,"The Bad---I gave this a low rating because i was shorted more than half the spacers, and the screws suck, 5 of them either stripped or broke off. I expected a little better products from an american company and that was the main reason i bought Bushwacker, you can get copies of these off ebay for half the price and i should have went that route. I was out a lot of time and gas running around town trying to find replacement screws and something i could use for spacers. Never found any screws and had to cut fuel line hose to make spacers...The Good---The flares fit fine."
4,Way ahead of it's time.,"The Gigabeat's slick design and beautiful display are what first attracted me to purchase this device. I have had it for two and a half years and it is still working like a charm. Granted I do not use it as much as my other audio devices. Sound playback is accurate except for a minor static sound right before each new song. Video playback on the gigabeat's screen is truly jaw dropping. Problems: battery life is non existent. After the first month the battery just would not stay for more than two hours. As for media for the device it is hard to find anything to buy, and conversion software is few and far between. The good thing about this device though is I can still use it as an external hard drive!"
4,Pretty good...,"Very pleased with the 60GB Gigabeat. Easy to use, looks slick, and easy to upload stuff onto it. Small caveat, the battery life might be a little short but, overall it's fine."
3,Mayor Flaw in Toshiba MES60VK Gigabeat 60 GB,"I have bought the S60 and I am totally disappointed. The device is nice and works fine but the way you have to sync the music using MediaPlayer 10 is not working for ripped CD's that do not have Tags. I have audio books that I did place in the Music folder using the FileManager. The S60 attempts to sort them by Artist, Song, Genres, etc. but does not give you a folder view as the F60 did or as any other MP3 player I owned did. This makes this player useless for anyone that likes to listen to audio books and music that was riped from a CD. I liked this device because of size bothy physically and storage but this flaw made me decide to put it on Ebay and get rid of it. It is unfortunate that such a flaw is produced by Toshiba. I even called the customer service and they told me to simply add tags to all my 7000 songs and audio books, Yeah right!!!My recommendation is do not buy this device until the patched this mistake in the interface design."
2,Fat and easily breakable,"At first I really liked this Gigabeat. It lasted about three months though as one small drop broke the player, disallowing it to play music. The Gigabeat is a very thick media device and by now I don't really suggest you buy it as there are plenty of other mp3 devices for the same price that are much more advanced than this one. The only thing I really liked about this Gigabeat was its loud sound."
2,1 - 2 hr. battery life,"Battery is awful, I had to send it back to be repaired.Customer Service said if it fails again,I will have to send it out again.A real LEMON."
1,Toshiba MESVK Gigabeat 60GB,"It should've been great, but wasn't.1) Doesn't keep your music on it very long after you've transferred to it.2) Doesn't transfer all of the music you tell it to transfer to it.3) Talked to one of my colleagues; the player itself cut out after having served for less than a year.Solve problems with what seem to be hard drive/memory errors, and design a program other than Windows Media Player (because it's buggy) to transfer music to it, give it what it needs to last for multiple years on end, and you'd have a 5 star product.Don't know where Toshiba's going to get the money for the R&D;, considering that no one really wants to buy anything other than those flippin' just-as-defective iPods these days, though.Until Toshiba can get it together, go for a Creative MP3 player."
5,WOW!!,"Ok, I'm new to the MP3 / PVP revolution, so please excuse the absolute awe over the fact that I can now hold half my quite large CD collection in the palm of my hand! I've had no problems at all syching music to this device, and the pictures are stunningly clear on this little gem. I still haven't put any video or TV on my new toy, but the screen resolution is nothing short of amazing! And the built in radio is ridiculously easy to program, as is everything else this impressive little machine has to offer. Thanks cnet! You have yet to let me down!"
5,Great Sound in a small package,"I have been enjoying the Gigabeat during my air travel. Viewing movies and listening to music drowns out the screaming kid in 10A. Just think, Toshiba is saving rug-rat lives wherever business travelers go."
2,Failed after only 3 weeks!,"I thought the MES60VK was absolutely great for the first 3 weeks - good features, excellent sound and easy to use. Then suddenly overnight, the battery went from 80% power to completely dead and would not recharge. The unit is now back at Toshiba for repair. Very disappointing."
1,This unit have very little life time,"Great units, sound is just super, but it's stopped working after 3 month, can not boot . Also when I try to charge battery, unit just getting hot."
1,Great MP3 player.....When it works.,"I bought this product in Oct. 2006 because the reviews were so great and I didn't want to deal with an IPod. It worked great for about 1 month and then the problems started with the battery. I would charge it one day and the next it would be dead. I called customer service and they said to reset the battery. Some days it worked and some days it didn't. It was a crap shoot every morning on wether or not the battery would be dead even if I had charged it all night. I only put up with it because I had spent $250 on the stupid thing and had spent so much time downloading my music library. It's been a year and after taking very good care of it, the thing dies without warning. It gives me the message to return to the manufacturer for repair. If Toshiba thinks I'm going send them any more of my hard earned money to fix this pos, they are sadly mistaken. I've wasted enough time and money on them and won't do it again."
5,A wow! for young adults,My daughters are very happy with it. Battery last long enough. It hasgreat picture quality. easy to use.Over all they are very pleased.
2,Stuck with WMP for transfering music files,"I bought a 60 gb Toshiba player a few months ago, and returned it to Amazon. I listen mostly to classical music and WMP makes absolute hash out of classical albums. (Not really their fault; most classical albums have info on them that us completely messed up.)This is not a probem with my Creative player; I just plug it in to a USB port and drag 'n drop the folders I want to the player, then create a playlist. You can't do this with the Toshiba; you MUST use WMP. Microsoft strkes again!"
3,Okay,I like my gigabeat. I feel the battery life could be way better. I found it also difficult to register the product. Finding accessories for the gigabeat has also been a trip. But overall I like it and would buy it again.
2,battery life sucks!!!!!,guys one thing is for sure the playback time is really low .....it dies down exactly when i need it and whats more pathetic is it erratic playback time ....sometimes lasts for 4 hours or even 3 hours .......PLEASE dont be misled by any reviews about battery life .........
1,"Nice on the surface, corrupt underneath.","I have had one for six months and have had to send it back for replacement four times. It has very poor software and no documentation. It has trouble playing protected files, and the hard drive gets corrupted at the drop of a hat. Once corrupted, there is no fix except returning it for replacement because there is no mechanism for totally erasing the hard drive and restoring the player to a virgin condition. There are virtually no accessories and it appears to me that Toshiba may abandon the product very soon, especially now that Microsoft has decided to make Zunes with another company. (In case you didn't know, the Zune so far has been a Gigabeat in disguise.)"
3,Good product - shame about the accessories.,"Good all round product: easy-to-use software, simple controls, good picture quality. However, part of this product genre is the personalisation which lets Toshiba down. The MP3 accessories are just not in the same class as the IPod's accessories, which makes me wish I would have bought one of those."
4,"Great Style, not enough substance","I really liked the Gigabeat S60. It looked beautiful, it sounded great, it synced pretty easy. My only problem was the lack of the ability to customize(background, menus, etc), the lack of a microphone recorder, and the complete lack of accessories. But for the price you can not find a better player with 60GB of memory!"
2,I returned this item,Item did not feel as solid as my ipod did. I do like the Microsoft OS on it so i went with the Zune which im now very happy with!
4,"Loved it, but that many feature","i have it for the pass 3 months and i'm having no problems at all, all the problems everyone is saying is not true mine is perfect. But the only thing i don't like is that it doesn't have the much features like the apple ipod it doesn't have no alarm clock,no search for music,no games,no memo, and no calender all this mp3 player has is tv,music,picture,video,radio, and setting. Would love it better if it has more feature but it doesn't, so that is why i only gave it 4 stars."
2,"Looks good, but looks can be decieving.","After I bought this product I was so excited. I actually got this in the mail a day or two early so I was even more excited because I got to use earlier than I thought. I opened up the package and started using it after I charged it to full. The next day I had to teach a martial arts class and I had all the connections to connect it to the radio and I made sure it was fully charged before leaving. After teaching an hour class before leaving I put the player to my ears to find that only after an hour the battery was dead. For the next week the player continued to die during my classes even though it was fully charged. I love the way this player looks, but the fact that it keeps screwing up on me pisses me off. Until finally I returned it and bought the new zune player in brown. Trust me, the toshiba is not worth the money, get the zune player, it's less gigabytes, but at least the battery won't die."
3,6 months then problems,It has died on me after around 2 years.Always have had problems charging it in carAll the music on it has being wiped off it twice for some reason.Now wont read or plug into the computer USB so cant put any of that music back onUSB Plug in player looks broken!It is like the 1st digital cameras they broke just by looking at them!Was easy to use an good for the 1st 6 months then all down hill form there withsmall Issues.Still would be working if can just plug into computer.
2,Long term use stinks,"I have had my 60 GB for almost 18 months with very few problems. Recently however the unit just stopped working for no reason. I tried to reformat the device with no success. Toshiba's website says to use the directions as outlined in the owners manual (which there are no directions for fixing the device). I then called customer service and they said that it would be $165 to repair the device regardless if it was a major fix or not. The unit has been very well cared for and is only 18 months old!!!I WILL NOT get another Toshiba product as my experience, and from I can see the Toshiba customer service experience for others, has been really poor."
5,Sharpest Knife I've Ever Used,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised when using this knife. All of the positive reviews set my level of expectation high, and this product still beat my expectations. It cut through green onions like butter. I kept cutting each slice thinner and thinner with amazement. It did the job with bell peppers, tomatoes, and I'm pretty sure anything else I throw at it. Well worth the sale price I paid for it. Definitely will get some for my family next time the price drops."
2,A good book,"This book is detailed and i recommend this book to the people who loves reading. I read this book 1 and a half years ago, but I liked it a little."
2,Shipped quickly however product qualtiy lacked,"The product was shipped quickly with no problems. However the Keychain came with a large sticker over the picture of David Bowie that never completely came off. I was pretty disappointed, it kind of ruined it for me."
1,Batteries,We use these for flash photography and the batteries do NOT last in comparison to cheaper ones bought at the discount store. Do not waste your money.
1,Boring,Immature characters. Very boring plot. Main characters repeat same dialogue in different situations.
4,Family,The Ernest collection is great as we love watching them. They are a very good family movies that all can watch. They are very funny and I can't keep from laughing all thro the whole thing.
3,buny-in-the-headlights,"crazy, zany, weird and anything else you can think of to describe Jim Varney's Ernest. I know he is not to everyone's taste, but he is so damned funny with so many of his Ernest-isms that you can't help but laugh. very good entertainment"
4,Good,Ernest is always funny and sweet. Still have to finish watching the whole collection. He is enjoyable and always has a message.
2,Poor packaging. Get Best of Ernest (10pk) instead.,"I downgraded my rating to 2 stars because Best of Ernest (10pk) includes all these movies and has a much better packaging.This is one of those Ernest products that probably won't be enjoyed by anyone unless they already know who Ernest is and likes his style of entertainment. As a Ernest fan, I really enjoyed seeing content I have never seen before. I mentioned in the title that the packaging is poor. That's because 2 DVDs are just thrown in paper sleeves and then put in an oversized DVD box. A lot of cases that contain more than 1 disc have a sturdy plastic page(s) to hold the discs."
4,Great Fit Great Material!,Great Fit Great Material! Son needs extra protection for Basketball. These will be great. He's thinner and needs the extra support and protection. Quality product!
5,Great Purchase,"I absolutely love these for playing Basketball. The Size was accurate and they don't limit you mobility in any way. I have also been using these as cycling shorts. Very happy with this purchase, and would buy again."
4,good product,Order a medium red thudd pad for basketball but got an email later on telling me that they've run out and if black was okay but when i ordered it said it was in stock.Really helps cushion the blows from knees. Buy this product if you need the protection. I knocked off 1 star for not getting what i ordered.
3,Runs small,It is exactly what I was looking for. I ordered XXL and it was too small. It would not fit comfortably up the thigh and the crotch was left hanging down. I guess these shorts are meant to grip the body. I am going to order 1-2 sizes bigger next time.
5,Glad I found this,"This album rocks in psychedelia, the banjo is picked at Le Mans speeds, the band nods politely to their 80's and 90's folk, rock `n' roll, and country brethren; REM, The Lemon Heads, The Indigo Girls, Blue Mountain, Bongwater and so on. I hear hand rolled joints, liquor from a jars and beer from cans."
4,Good album with a few great gems,"I really like the Decemberist's Colin Meloy's storytelling style and musical compositions. So I was intrigued when I stumbled across this earlier incarnation. After trying out a few songs I was hooked. There are some really amazing songs on the album, my favorites are Keeping me awake, Tristan and Iseult, Sister Nebraska, Neapolitan Bridesmaid, and If I had more time. His songwriting skills are unbelievable, weaving in literary references to Camus along with lyrical imagery like a shy pigeon toe'd state of Nebraska smiling at you. The only real problem with the collection is that the musical style can get a little repetitive. If you like guitar and violin heavy musical stories you'll love this album. Take the Decemberists and dial back the experimentation and dial up the country/bluegrass elements.Many Tarkio songs are on my regular playlist and are among my all time favorites."
2,Broke after one month,I need a quick release keychain to separate my work keys from house keys. This seemed to be what I needed but it broke after one month's use. Still looking for a keyring separator that would last longer than one month.
1,broke in a week,With normal use (1 key on one side and 2 keys on the other) this broke just a few days after I purchased it.
5,These are great!,"I have these mounted on a small mobile work station that weighs in excess of 400 pounds. These roll smoothly, cross the concrete expansion joints effortlessly, and lock down tight with absolutely no movement in any direction when doing heavy work on the table. Highly recommended."
3,I was looking for more,"This Video was ok but I was thinking there would be more information as it is a wider subject than they investigated. One example is an actress talking about how her daughter, 3 years old prayed at the table. Not the most remarkable of angel stories. I expected more info on Angels than I got. I and many friend love the angels --this showed so little about them, and even less of their potential in honoring God by ""helping "" us humans."
5,Great Service,"Very pleased with the service received. Video was listed as new and was, surprisingly, since it was about 15 years since broadcast on PBS. It was delivered 5 days earlier than expected and was in great shape. Would definitely purchase from this person again."
2,Far too elementary for me,"Upgrading to Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger: Visual QuickProject GuideThis book would possibly be helpful to a Mac neophyte, but for me, a Mac user for 26 years, it is virtually useless. I had hoped it would serve as a guide to changed procedures and using new features, but it doesn't. I've used 2 of the missing manual series by David Pogue (whom I know: he's a very talented and funny guy in person) but his books, which range about 700-900 pages, go overboard in their detail. I was hoping for the middle ground when I ordered this book, but it's at the opposite extreme. At 125 pages for $12.95, it costs a dime a page, most of which are scarcely worth a penny!"
3,Not What I Expected,"I wanted a trimmer for my sideburns, mustache and beard. The unit is nice but the closest trim you can get from it is 1/4 inch which turned out to be longer than I wanted. My previous trimmer had a closer attachment for trimming and this trimmer doesn't do it. Also they don't have an accessory trimmer head for shorter cuts available so I'm stuck with using my old trimmer. This is really my fault since they say 1/4 inch but for whatever reason I envisioned it to be closer than it turned out. It's not a bad unit, just wrong for the person that wants a shorter cut available."
2,Real beards need not apply,"Ever used a really crappy vacuum cleaner? You run it over the same little patch of carpet again and again, but you still hear it picking up more dirt. Finally, you move on to a new patch of carpet, frustrated and resigned to the fact that your carpet is still a little dirty over there.That's how I feel using this beard trimmer. I run it over my face in the same spot, over, and over, and over again. But it's still trimming hairs. I could be in the bathroom for an hour and still come out with an uneven trim. I'd rather just grow my beard until I look like a hobo. At least it would look even.I'm returning the trimmer as soon as I finish writing this review."
2,Not battle ready!,Figures designed for chopper will not fit in cockpit. Cockpit window continually falls off. Troop door hard to close. Best to remove when playing.
1,Nothing else but the endorsement from Caruso,"I must agree with the reviewer who said that the book had nothing to do with Caruso's own wisdom of singing. The author just gathered his ideas and got the endorsement from Caruso that what he wrote in the book was correct. I expected Caruso's personal anecdotes or some kind of description of his sensations or things that Caruso kept in mind when he sang. To me, personally, this was a waste of my time and money."
5,MY HERO,A remarkable life...A powerful struggle finally won at the end. Brenda Bratton is my HERO...Having shared in her life has made me grateful that she is in mine. Pass the tissues as you take the walk with Brenda and Carolyn to the place called Sorrow Bound...You will never be the same...
1,silly,Don't read this if you really want to learn something about real Welsh mythology. This is full of naive ideas and fabrications.
3,Works ok,"Have it on wood fish house in the middle of the lake and I get some stations, not sure why not all. Other than that it was cheap and you get what you pay for."
5,Boss (Really Boss) Marine (Motorcycle) Rubber Radio Antenna,This Boss Marine (Motorcycle) Rubber Radio Antenna works really BOSS on my 78 Honda Goldwing equipped with a Vetter III Faring with Vetter Cycle Sound.It keeps the radio dry and accessible as need to change CD's or Radio Stations.
4,have only looked at so far,"have only looked at as of yet ,just installed and it fits good ,price was right , work good on bench test and no problems on install"
4,Good antenna just a short cord,"I got the antenna it works great, I just wish the cord that came with it was longer to span the length to the back of my 16ft boat."
3,Ok,This works ok. Where we fish on the river we have a hard time picking up local signals. So we don't really plan on using FM much then. We will use the SD card feature and use the jack for USB and for cell phones to use Pandora instead.
1,Junk,This antenna is not worth the price. Spend a little more and buy something that works. Very poor reception. I'm going to shop for something better.BOSS AUDIO MRANT12 MARINE RUBBER ANTENNA
3,"Ok, not great but not bad either","Like the title says. It's ok. The install was easy and well explained in the directions. It picks up more than my old antennae, the coiled up wire type but I did expect a little more."
1,P.O.S. antenna,I have installed dozens of antenna's in my life and this has to be the worst. It pulled 3 of the normal 15 stations I get and they were not very good. Don't waste your money on this antenna. It was so poor that Amazon didn't even want me to ship it back and gave me a refund for it. Thanks Amazon.
2,Antennae,This antennae was bought to mount on a golf cart that is used for trail riding. The antennae has great reception. Downside is keeping it tight. Moves around a lot. Easy to install.
1,it's junk. do not waste your money.,"After 4 days of use, salt water got inside antenna mount. The rest of the story you can imagine. In a few days contacts become rusted. Reception is zero. It's not designed for salt water spray."
1,A waste of Money,I get better reception using a piece or electrical wire stuck in the antenna input. Very disappointed in this product. The set up instructions are rubbish.
2,SmallExpectations,I was looking for a small radio antenna for my 16 foot fishing boat that wasn't big and gaudy. This antenna fit the profile but was not the performer I was looking for. The range of reception is very short and the directions for installation were next to none.
5,Boss MRANT12 Antenna,got this antenna to use outside in the screened in porch hooked up to a standard car stereo. Works great. easy to assemble and the cord was actually long enough without purchasing an extention.
3,mount it away from wiring,"Works very well if away from wiring, do not install below deck or inside center console, the higher /open the better"
3,Missing instructions are essential...,"Other reviewers have mentioned the absence of instructions, but indicated they eventually figured out how to use the antenna without them. I'm stumped without the instructions. It is not at all self evident how to attach the cable base to the antenna. Also unclear is how to attach the combination of the two to your vehicle. I think this particular antenna may be more complicated than others because of the weather shielding... Who do I contact for ""technical support"" with this item?One other issue: the additional product info says ""stretches to 56 inches"". That had left me with the impression that the antenna would extend to 56 inches. Nope. The cable is 56"" long. The fixed-length antenna is about 12"" long.The manufacturing quality appears to be ok. I haven't yet been able to test the reception..."
3,"cheap, no instructions, it works","The soft metal that makes up the base of the antenna broke during installation, but I was still able to use it. The bolt that comes with the antenna was a little short, so I had to go buy a longer one that would extend through the fiberglass bulkhead on my boat. It works for now, but I don't expect it to last for more than a few years. It still doesn't come with instructions!"
4,"Nice, masculine bag","I really like this bag; I do wish the lighter color were available - but the brown is light enough for my taste. The size is perfect; not too wide and not too tall - just right. I'n not a huge fan of the hardware and I'm definitely not a big fan of the plastic click type closure for the flap - I think they'd have done better to use the same magnetic type closure you find on the back pocket of the bag. Lastly, I would have preferred a slightly stiffer leather. All in all though, it's a very nice bag - I'm certainly not sorry I bought it.Were it not for those minor things, I'd have given this bag a 5."
4,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This bag is just what I have been looking for! It looks nice and professional, but laid back too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the carrying capacity was not as much as I had hoped for. I just wish the main compartment was about 2 inches wider. Other than that, this bag is perfect for work and school!"
1,Man Purse,"The bag is built nicely and the strap is decent. However, the width is too small and it looks like a large purse. I was too lazy to return it so I'm stuck w/ it. Any takers?"
4,Legacy Leader Teddy Messenger Bag,"Looks great for a man or a woman. Lots of interior pockets to hold pens, wallet, cell phone etc, in addition to large main pocket that holds a couple of books/binders or my Macbook. My only complaint is the weird static electricity that develops between the bag and my leg when I'm walking a longer distance with it on. This could be due to the clothes I'm wearing or the dry weather though. Overall a great looking, high quality bag."
4,Students love it!,I purchased this as a replacement book for my library. The students love this book and I go through them menay times over.
1,Can it get any dumber,"I hated it! I had to stop reading in the middle of book because I was in TOTAL PAIN the story was so stupid. My goodness, is the world running so low on storylines we have to read about some wierd ancient spiders that fall in love with some ditzy humans! Frankly, I didn't care if all the charecters died in the first 50 pages! I wanted to burn the book so no one else would have to wast any precise time even picking it up!!!!!!!!!!!! The ONLY reasons why I would give it 1 star is because NO ONE ELSE would EVER think of that....imaginative of a story and because the author actually did take time to write the story."
3,You get what you pay for,"These are OK, but know a couple of things up front:1. If you buy these to replace existing casters, the overall dimensions might not be the same since the swivel bearings and wheel bracket are made of less expensive materials. Measure carefully before buying.2. When I say inexpensive materials, I mean the Chinese kind. Thinner metal, small axle bolt/nut, tiny bearings. Another reason not to buy anything from China. Period.Bottom line: not the best caster in the world but adequate for most needs."
3,Nice large knife block.,"Very nice size knife block to accomodate my growing knife collection. I had outgrown my smaller block, so I purchased this one to upgrade my storage capacity. I received mine with a chip out of the bottom back edge, but decided to just keep it, since this side is towards the backsplash of my counter anyway."
3,somewhat disappointed,One of our Shun knives didn't even fit in a slot. I was able to saw a slot to accommodate the knife.
4,Great block to house all those odd shaped Japanese knives,This block has saved my Shun knives from being dumped into the cutlery drawer by my wife. It houses all those odd shaped knives that I have gotten from Shun and all the Henckels knives I also owned. One block and no nicked knives = one happy camper.
3,"Nice block, doesn't fit Shun's own knives","I bought this block because I received a Shun Classic 7.5"" Santoku and was looking to purchase more Shun knives. I figured a Shun block would fit their own knives, but none of the slots other than the cleaver slot (which is 2x too wide for it) will accommodate the Santoku.I'm returning the block, but if the knife fit it'd a nice looking block and I'd be keeping it. Make sure you know the dimensions of the slots beforehand."
5,Kitchen essential,"I recommend this item from this seller, as I had some problems even getting a ball of twine from *another* seller through amazon. This is a rather large spool of twine, but it still fits in my narrow kitchen drawer."
3,Too Big,The ball of twine is way too big for the container they sell to put it in. Other than that the twine is great.
2,BIG mistake,I can't believe I didn't read the reviews for the twine or the dispenser before buying. The ball of twine is huge and doesn't fit the dispenser even if I used a jack hammer - what a crazy thing to make a dispenser that doesn't fit your own twine. Wacky. Other than that the twine is fine...
5,newest goodies for the best price,"I replaced a three year old Dell with this HP. It was between this one and another Dell. They both had most of the same important basic features, but this one was stock with 512 mb ram, 80 gb hard drive and DVD. The dell was an upgrade from 256, and so was DVD and only a 40 gb hard drive. The price difference was the deal maker. Why pay more for less computer, HP also has good customer service and good products (checked with Consumer Reports), Dell is not all that. It's way fast and Windows XP is very user friendly. It has some nice loaded software like Record Now and WIN DVD, nice 64mb graphics card and plenty of USB ports for all your toys. I'm loving it. Now I just need to save up and replace my old crt monitor with a swanky new LCD flat screen."
2,Upset Richard,"Very bad choice when I bought this machine. It was not nearly as fast as advertised. The graphics were as bad as the sound. My version had no ability to go into ""standby"" or ""hibernate"" modes. When I spent 45 minutes with HP's ""support"", their conclusion was that something was wrong and all the software should be zapped and replaced. The response to the mouse command was erratic, slow, and sometimes, didn't happen at all.Needless to say, this loser was returned to where it came from.Richard"
3,Locking caster,"This is rather flimsy. It was one of the only casters I found that lock, but the lever that you push down to lock it brakes of very easily. I don't think much of the design because of this."
3,OK product,"The casters are 2"" but if you are building something you will have to add 1/2"" to the top of the plate. I'm giving these casters a 3 rating because the locking lever requires more effort to move than I think is necessary. They get a little better if you break them in by flipping them up and down for a while (You shouldn't have to). Having said that, I acknowledge that the wheel lock is positive - the wheels will not turn when the lock is engaged. Cosmetically they are OK. I wouldn't use them for something really nice."
5,The Deep End - Spyro Gyra,This is got to be one of Spyro Gyra's best albums released to date. This group is amazing considering they have been around for more than 30 years.
4,Heading in a great direction,A band lasting 30 yrs. is an amazing feat in itself. With this release I feel SG is moving forward in a good way. Julio's songs are especially appealing. The band is continuing to entertain and fun to listen to. That's all a fan could ask for.
4,Chillout lounge music,"Bought on impulse after listening to one of the tracks on Pandora, it turned out to be exactly what I expected: relaxing, chillout music to listen while reading or having a nice glass of white wine sitting on your patio, looking at a sunset."
4,Great Album from a Great Band,"Spyro Gyra has always been one of my favorite bands. It doesn't matter how they are classified: Jazz, fusion jazz, etc., they produce some of the most enjoyable music in my collection. Even if I am not in the mood for ""jazz,"" I can rock out to Spyro Gyra.""The Deep End"" was released in 2004, although I didn't discover it until 2006. This is a very pleasant album, with very memorable melodies. I still find myself humming some of them from time to time.""Monsoon"" stands out on this album, and my only complaint is that it could be longer! The next time I see Spyro Gyra live, I would hope that this song is on their play list. ""The Crossing"" is melancholy and upbeat at the same time - extraordinary! Get this CD - it is really uplifting and enjoyable."
1,Save your money!,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. This is a PBS special, and the Soundies are constantly interrupted by talking heads or narration, or are truncated. What could've been a great release -- uncut, restored music videos of a bygone era -- instead becomes one of the worst, most disappointing DVDs of the year. I'm returning mine for a refund."
1,Don't Bother,"Amazon ""spammed"" my email encouraging me to buy this disc which is too bad because this disc is absolutely horrid. This DVD has talking through all the cuts....shame on Amazon.....I feel used...and stupid....."
4,Interesting documentary,"I enjoyed this - not just a collection of ""soundies"" but has documentary information. If you just want collections of clips (as videos to scroll through), don't buy this. But if you want some great footage with some context, very enjoyable."
4,Video clips of the Forties,"This is a documentation on music and a way a media (the music clips) sold it. Very informative and interesting to see big stars in the beginning of their careers, and there isn't a better choice than Michael Feinstein as the host. - Regarding the previous comments, if you would have checked out the product more carefully, you would have known what you were buying. Especially you people in the States know what PBS is all about, high quality enter-/intotainment, even education."
3,overpriced,"The product is fine. It is for lightweight applications. My problem is with the price . This is exactly the same product that grizzly sells for $1.50. This is $4.99, which is more than 300% higher."
5,Great Product,"This product works great, I attached 4 of them to 3/4"" plywood and it holds my 150lb printer with ease."
5,another magical making,"Kimberly Kirberger is the most brillant author of todays youth. When i purchased this journal i couldnt stop writing down my thoughts. Colin from the real world 8 really makes the journal complete on his thoughts. I am a fan of Mrs Kirberger and i want to thank her for saving me in every way possible. Through heart and soul, i think every one will agree with me on this journal by saying it was a item in which we all will cherish."
5,I'm impressed,"My mom bought me both books at some book signing thing and when she gave them to me I was like...thanks. I started reading the book Teen Love first and I couldn't put it down. The real shocker though was the journal. This was as good as the book. It had so many great things in it. Poetry and quotes and something called Colin's pages which are pages with a guys opinion. I don't know hinm from TV but my friends do..anyways it was good ,too. The two books were great and I was just surpised that something my mom bought me was so good."
5,a really good book,Kimberly Kirbergers book is good. Its a good way to answer questions about relationships.
4,strong performance by the leading lady but not much else,"This is not really a good movie. The story (a mermaid captures a married man on a fishing holliday and persuades him to take her with him on land) is being told in a much too simple way, it's almost boring. The reason I still give it 4 stars is because I really enjoyed the way miss Johns plays the mermaid. Then there is also a really funny, if short, appearence by Margaret Rutherford. In this case the sequel (""Mad About Men"") was better than the original."
4,squeeze-bulb Christmas gifts,"All who received the bulbs were excited. None have used them yet that I am aware of. The shipping, etc., was good."
4,Love Maddy Hunter!!!!!!!,"I have read all of Maddy Hunter's ""Passport to Peril"" mysteries! They are so funny!When poor Emily and her grandmother go on a senior's tour of Switzerland, trouble is never very far away! I personally, would love it, if any one of the books became a movie!! The characters are a riot!!! A bunch of misfit cronies going to different places together is a must read! I don't believe I could put up with some of the stuff the people do. I love that some of the characters come back and that new ""seniors"" are introduced! Ms. Hunter travels to each destination beforehand, to get her ""ideas"" for each of her books! Take me with you Maddy, take me with you!! If you get the chance, read the whole series! I promise you will love them!!"
2,Misses the mark,"The premise has promise, but 2 things really prevented me from getting into the story.1) For me, what works, humor-wise, in a story is having a ridiculous/funny situation and a rational protagonist who must find her way through the crazy situations. In this story, ridiculous situations arise again and again (perhaps situations that are a bit too ridiculous and a bit too frequent) and the main character seemed to become caught up in the flow and have no reaction. This undercut a lot of the humor for me and made the story transition from funny to exasperating.2) Generalization, generalization, and more generalizations."
5,Hilarious mystery !!,"Emily Andrew is her grandmother's traveling companion on a senior citizens' tour to Switzerland. They check in at the hotels and ""events"" start to happen: people die, Emily repeatedly gets into water of one kind or another, the food is awful, someone else dies, Emily gets chummy with the police, their luxury hotel room never seems to materialize. And it goes on and on, all depicted by the very witty mind of Maddy Hunter.I can't wait to read this whole series and the esccapes of of Emily Andrew."
2,Cheap laughter,"""Alpine for You"" is funny. Not as funny as some other books of the same genre (Laura Levine's mysteries come to mind), and there are funnier situations in mysteries not written specifically for laughter, but funny enough for a light reading. Also it is an acceptable mystery --- although just barely.What makes the book rather repellent is the ridiculously distorted picture of Switzerland. It would not be an issue if the preposterous problems with the hotel, food, service and attitudes were shown as isolated exceptions and balanced by a more truthful overall picture. The way the description is generalized is nauseating and cheap."
1,Funny? Not to me,"I bought Alpine for You because I love to travel, both ""for real"" and through books.However, this read like a bashing of everything Swiss. If the writer has ever been there, she was unable to find anything she liked. I kept thinking there ought to be a ""laugh track"" as in a bad TV sitcom, to let the reader know when something was supposed to be funny.I bought 3 of Hunter's books at once, and will probably not bother to read the other 2, set in Ireland and Italy. Had there been a ""no stars"" option, I'd have chosen that!"
1,I give up,"I must be a glutton for pain, I read another of this writer's books. The premise is good, but the talk of sex borders on pure bathroom humor. No more."
1,Disappointed,"I am a fan of mysteries and don't believe there are many authors I haven't read and liked.I got this book because it was highly recommended as being nearly as good as Evanovich. What utter disappointment! Whereas Evanovich's humour is original and truly funny, Hunter is trying too hard and the humour is forced and makes you cringe.Although the storyline seems ok I just couldn't bear to read past page 50 - it was too painful."
5,Really enjoyable mystery,"I have read a lot of REALLY BAD cozies hoping and praying that they would be as entertaining and fun and enjoyable as the reviewers at this website say they are only to be disappointed on almost every occasion. This book, however, really IS a fun read. Don't go in expecting a heavy, dark, complicated and involved mystery - read Robert Crais for that. But for an enjoyable book that will have you laughing out loud and wanting for more - read this book. I couldn't read it right before bed because it was so funny it would wake me up instead of putting me to sleep! Others have given very apt descriptions so I won't go into all that. Let's just say this very hard to please mystery reader has found a new author to read."
4,Not attached to Political Correctness!,"An enjoyable read, very funny and warm. There were few things which didn't make sense and seem to be thrown in only to keep the humor going - however, it would be funnier if it was more logical. For example, the Main Character's suitcase is lost - she wears her Grandma's funny clothes - and worries about the cost of buying more. To start - a hotel of this level would immediately compensate someone, and to end, if her Grandmother is rich (she won the lottery)- why isn't she buying her grandchild a watch? some clothes? Too many odd things that don't make a lot of sense, as I said, kind of ruin the flow of the story. But it was still a fun book - if you turn off your common sense."
5,Hold onto your head!,"Scooby and his pals from Mystery, Inc. are about to lose their heads over their latest case! The legendary headless horseman is haunting the woods near the historic Ruppscupper cabin. At the same time, the heir to the Ruppscupper estate has returned home after many years of travel. Is it coincidence... or is something more mysterious going on? It's up to Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby to find out!"
4,Easy read but can not put it down,A very interesting book that probably mirrors life better than most best sellers. It has a simplicity that seems very real life like.
4,"An excellent CD, that all fans should purchase","This CD has great B-Sides that cannot be found anywhere else. There is also a great live recording of ""Just"" that every fan should have."
2,book,"the delivery of the book was fast, but the book was not in the condition that it was stated to be in. there were vast amounts of highlighting and major creases within the book and on it's cover. don't take a chance on this seller if you hate highlights throughout your books."
2,Written,"The Luck Casino Pendant weas the right size and I loved the shape, but the item was very cheap looking and not shiny at all. I bought a longer chain for it (not an expensive one) and the pendant was so dull looking, I could not wear them together. I would not reccoment this product to anyone.MFT - Jacksonville, FL"
1,Christian science is oxymoron,Christian science if you can call it science is as bad as a oxymoron as honest politician. Science in anyway shape or form should not be perverted by religion which has slaughtered more people than any other war.
2,"The mother, the son, and the socialite",The story of this books is lost among all of the historical clutter. The author writes about too much past and not enough about the story line. I find my self skipping pages and twice whole chapters. Very disapointing.
3,overpriced,This is a small light duty caster that works fine for what it is. It is exactly the same caster and brand name that Grizzly sells. Grizzlys price for the fixed or swivel is $1.50.
4,"Fine set of wheels for great price, but faulty ad","I installed these on a small table I use for my laptop. They work very smoothly, swivel just fine, and seem plenty sturdy for what I'm using them for. The price was excellent, the best I could find on the web.My only complaint is that they come with no screws, which didn't bother me as I had plenty on hand. I'm cutting one star because the ad didn't say the screws weren't included, and it should have. Also, the ad clearly says they have brakes. The ones I got certainly did not, and the picture on the ad shows wheels with no brakes, contradicted later by saying they have them. I didn't want brakes, so it was OK for me. If you need screws or brakes go somewhere else. Otherwise it's a really good product and price...I'd recommend them if you've got plenty o' loose screws and don't need a brake. Pun intended."
4,Mark Atkins is an amazing didgeridoo artist,"Every one of Mark's songs clearly tells a story. If you go to any of his concerts (usually in Europe) he will introduce the song and you can follow the wonderful picture he paints with the didge.If you love didge, listen to this album. Mark is an acclaimed didgeridoo master and his music is highly praised amongst didge players themselves."
2,Mark Atkins ? I thought it was anybody else but Mark Atkins,"Just listened to an mp3 of the cd. A friend gave it to me, along with other didge music. I've had several workshops from Mark Atkins, and when I listened to this, I was about sure that it wasn't him.I was just going to write to my friend, that this was fake,and that a person who just learned to play didgeridoo a couple of years ago, made an attempt.I looked it up on the internet, and it was the same as I've heard. Couldnt believe the high ranked review on All Direct Artist. But when I heard a piece of it, I knew that it must have been Mark Atkins, who was obviously playing a little tune while sleeping.Wake up, giant ! Don't be an ant."
5,My 19 year old is crazy about this cassette,I have not actually seen the book but do have the music cassette for A Cabbage Patch Christmas. My daughter (19) absolutely loves the music and we are in search of a another copy as ours is wearing out. The music also tells the true reason for the christmas season- Jesus.
4,More than good looks,"I purchased this as a gift for someone who had borrowed a Tippmann with this drop forward installed on it. I thought it was a very expensive piece of eye candy, but it was what they wanted. However, after using the modified marker I was amazed at how much better balanced the marker was with a 16oz tank attached. It not only improved the feel, but was much less tiring after a full day of play. I still think it is over-priced, but it *IS* functional."
1,Tastes like throat lozenges,"This cherry flavoring tastes like throat lozenges. Horrible flavor, especially for candy.P.s. I got a small drop of the oil on my finger and later touched my lip. It burned caustically. It was horrible, for at least a minute i was in agony with faucet pouring directly in my mouth."
3,Keep shopping,"I purchased the blue rain jacket for my 6 year old in summer camp. The jacket serves its purpose, but it is very poor quality. The seams are heat sealed and I predict that it will not take long before it rips apart. The product will keep your child dry, but think of it as disposable."
2,Okay,"I thought this was going to be a thick rain coat, but turns out it's more like a rain slicker. A little pricy for just a rain slicker when you pay for shipping."
3,Attack Force Z,Very ordinary. Interesting only for young Mel Gibson and Sam Neil. Catch it on TV sometime.
5,A Happy Find,I have searched for this movie for the past three of four years to complete my mom's Mel Gibson movie collection! I was ecstatic to find it not only in stock but at a reasonable price! It will make a lovely Christmas present. Momma will be thrilled. =)
4,Attack Force Z,"A real good World War Two movie.Well written story and produce.A fast action movie. The acting is very good.You won,t go wrong."
2,not impressed. low budget.,"Disapointed. I really like ww2 films, but this is low budget. I understand some people liked it, by their reviews, but I couldn't get by the poor quality. There are so many really good war films out there, that this one just does not compare at all. It is the type of movie that you would see on those multi movie dvd packs like in the bins at Walmart. you might like it, but don't expect a quality film."
5,Attack Force Zed very Entertaining,"Somewhat standard war flick from the time period( see extras on dvd regarding original Director's desire to make anti-war film). That being said, the film was very entertaining, good man-cave flick."
1,cartoon quality,The movie became a cartoon of martial arts fighting. It was a total joke. The movie started out for the first fewminutes with a silent sound track. It should have stayedsilent.
5,Attack Force Z,"I had a good experience with this purchase , It came in a timely manner and the quality was good .Thanks again Bill"
3,Early Mel Gibson and Sam Neill movie.,"It's interesting to watch the very young looking Mel Gibson and Sam Neill play second fiddle to fading actor John Phillip Law in this low budget war film. I loved this movie as a kid when it was shown repeatedly on HBO. Afterall, it's essentially a boy's war movie: elite Allied commandoes on a suicide mission behind enemy lines. Think ""Guns of Navarone"" with Australians vs. the Japanese and minus Germans, big guns, and a big budget. ""Attack Force Z"" is pretty much a GRADE B movie; but boys and action fans will probably still love it."
3,Good action from a young Mel Gibson,"Good war/action flick, but don't expect the gory realism or historic authenticity of other more famous films. Great performances by Gibson, Neill and cast. The movie also does a pretty decent job of portraying the psychology of men involved in high-risk, special operations. Don't over-analyze this movie, just sit back and enjoy it."
1,Just not that funny.,"This episode had an all-star cast. In the past, I've really enjoyed Reggie Watts and Zack Galifianakis. But the host is annoying. I didn't really laugh that much."
5,"Comedy so nice, they banged it twice.",Being a fan of the podcast I was delighted ever episode of this season. Here is to hoping they pick it up for another so we can maybe get some of Harris' Foam Corner on the tube.
4,from audio to visual,"Comedy Bang Bang show is everything the podcast is and more. CBB presents TV and Comedy guests in a zany environment hosted by the always clever Scott Aukerman(The Chawktaw) and band leader Reggie Watts. If you like the show check out the podcast by Binging ""Comedy Bang Bang podcast"" (be sure to use [...])"
5,A weirdly appealing absurdest comedy show,"This show is pretty much Tim & Eric meets high production values but with more random skits and new guest stars(and crazy characters) every week that's disguised as a TV talk show. It's a a lot to handle, but oddly hilarious when you watch. Host Scott Auckerman is great along with Reggie Watts, they bring a great charm to the show. If anything in the first sentence interested you, try it out."
5,Fun Fun Fun and Daddy Lets You Keep the T-Bird!,"What can one say about the old CBB experience? Well, lets just start with the classic phrase: This is how we do it"" popularized by a one, Montell Jordan, in the 1990's. This is indeed how one does it and they are doing it mon frere. Yes!"
3,Mixed effort - great hero,"I'm torn on Ms. Maxwell's latest; I really liked the hero and the overall plot of the book. I love horses too, so that influenced me. However, the heroine really got on my nerves. Sometimes I liked her and could understand her actions; at other times she was a very annoying and immature snot stamping her foot and whining about her independence. I don't think she ultimately matched up in strength of character to the excellent self-made hero (something you don't often get to see in historical romance, though it's becoming more common). That said, the last section of the book is the best of it, and the heroine becomes more likeable.If you like historical romance and you're looking for a light, mostly frothy read, then give this one a try. If you're looking for a more intense and sunstantial story with a hero and heroine who live on with you, this probably isn't the one for you."
2,major disappointment,i am sorry i really wanted to like this book but didn't. thereviewer who called the heroine an immature snot was right. shewas annoying as well. i did not like one thing about. the herowas much more interesting a character. i am not a 'horse person' but i can appreciate it when someone who knows what they are talking about writes about it. even that was flat and boring.if you have never read cathy maxwell don't start with thisbook get any of her earlier ones they are much much better!
3,Everyone but the heroine,The heroine comes off rather idiotic and dogmatic. I loved the hero and the side characters were interesting but Mary's only real plus was her beauty. She has dogged determination but apparently not much in the way of brains which made the story rather tedious. Some of her actions come off as childish and tantrum like.
4,"Kenny G ""I'm in the mood for love""","Enjoyed ""Rhythm and Romance "" better ,but because it has a different rhythm and beat , it does lend itself to a softer and more melodic mood and the more I play it , the more I'm enjoying it."
4,ROMANTIC QUALITY,"I love the romantic quality of Kenny G's CD. When I'm with my girlfriend - it's the perfect music for a candle light dinner. However, for dessert I playPacific Loungeby Jessie Allen Cooper and Tim Ponzek."
3,all Kenny G...of course,A nice compilation of Kenny G...but I guess a whole cd of his high pitch sax is a bit overpowering. Would be nice if blended more with orchestra to soften the effect.
3,And another cover cd,"Though the arrangements are good and he plays as good as allways, I'm not the person who is waiting to hear a cover cd, again. To bad it is his second on a row cover cd... Hope there will be some new material soon."
5,Awesome recording,"Kenny G has the groove the catchy sax playing that he,s known for this is a cd I highly reccemend to buy right away. George"
5,Kenny G WOW,Wonderful music as always. Never tire of his soft music. Great music to add to your collection.
1,jazz??,jazz ---- this is not jazz! kenny g is not a jazz musician or even an elevator musician -- I am sick of talking about jazz to people and the first person they bring up is kenny G ! this cd is horrible along with everything else kenny g does ! he has no talent --- no tone and no form or complexity in his music every song sounds the same -- the person who wrote the review before this does not know what they are talking about --- if you want to hear real well played music that you can relax to PLEASEdo yourself a favor and check out Boney James !
2,Customer Service is Terrible,"Within 9 months of purchasing this monitor a thin red line appeared that ran from the top of the monitor to the bottom. When I contacted the company for repairs the customer service was terrible. I was NEVER able to reach a live person, was constantly disconnected, and informed the only way I could be guaranteed that my product would be accepted for repair was to return it in its orginal packaging (9 months later mind you). I would not purchase this product again purely based on service issues."
1,Died after warranty expired,"The display looks good when your first purchase it, but parts are cheap and speakers are terrible. The power supply died exactly one year after purchase, just in time for the warranty to expire. Look elsewhere for lasting quality."
3,Nice computer bag,It is of good quality pretty snug expect to carry just your laptop and cord nothing else
4,Very nice liturgical pieces.,"This 'Te Deum', plus 'Super Flumina Babilonis' and 'Confitebor Tibi Domine' by Michel-Richard Delalande is very good late Renaissance / early Baroque liturgical music; however, it is not do great that I am especially thrilled at paying four times the original list price, even with the excellent realization by William Christie and ensemble. If you simply must have every available piece of recorded motets, this is a worthy recording. If you simply want some inspiring music, buy Bach!"
1,Waste of money -- it doesn't replace all panels,"To expand on the title, you get only the two pieces shown in the picture. Sure, I should have expected that ""ONLY what you see is what you'll get,"" but I at least expected to get the small piece for the bottom front. You don't get that piece, or the one that covers the battery. So if you buy this and put it on, your Razr will just look odd. Be careful when buying replacement panels."
2,Too many small parts,"My 6yr old really enjoy playing with this toys only because it has water involved, all the other stuff she could pretty much careless. To me there are way too many small parts."
5,So blessed I found this!,"I am so blessed to have purchased this book early in our homeschool experience. They weren't very many formal cirriculum packages I liked, but everyone I knew was using them. Now what? I found this book and I am able to build my entire cirriculum around the contents! Our library has most of the books I need, or can be lent from another library. It has helped our budget TONS! This is a purchase you will not regret!"
2,Outdated,"This book is from 1998. It is too outdated to be useful. There are many new programs and books that aren't listed. Even though it's a huge book, I went through it in less than an hour and probably got all from it that I'm going to get. Better to rent this from the library, but even then, look for something more recent."
5,The BEST resource book I have found!!!,"This book has it all. Books, websites, multimedia, magazines, etc. listed with descriptions and often with how the material was used by their family. It is filled with excellent ideas!"
3,"Excellent resource, but not for Christian homeschoolers","This is an excellent resource guide, full of more information than I could imagine anyone ever needing! I was disappoointed, however, with some obvious omissions of Christian curriculums and suppliers. In addition, her attitude toward the few she did mention was, to say the least, condescending. I would not recommend this book to Christian homeschoolers looking for resources with a biblical perspective."
2,Poor illustrations,"I don't know what book the other reviewers saw, but the copy I have has illustrations that rank with those in high school texts of the 60s. All black-and-white, or rather darkish gray and white, no snap, very bland, on low quality (for reproduction) paper. An office inkjet printer could do much better. With the importance of color in contemporary architecture this is ridiculous (especially for the price). I think that books on visual matters should look good themselves --- otherwise, how do we get excited? How do we begin to want to read it?"
1,Disappointed,"One star is too much. This was one of two I ordered - one to replace the other. The electroniccontrols did not work. I tried three different batteries (one from the package, two new ones from the store) and the camera responded the same. The LCD readout would not display correct information. It was garbled."
1,Plastic Scam,"Not only is this thing all plastic with FIXED levers that are merely decorative, if you look at the product image carefully you'll see a HUGE black plastic black box on the back of it which even kills the cuteness factor of it. My 35mm Minox at least fit in my pocket, when the lens was folded shut."
1,camera from adorarama,"The item (camera) from Adorarama with no other parts and no manual. Seller did say I could return it, which I have done."
1,Be careful. Could be low quality!,"A PC Hardware Fan from Newton, MA USAI have the previous model from this line of the PCs. I like the slick design. The PC is very noisy, but the worse thing is that my CD RW drive has died. Sony would not fix it under the existing warranty, because I forgot to mail the customer information card."
5,Great Ending to the heavyweight grand prix,"yes, the very last fight does end in disappointing fashion, but the entire card before that is filled with extremely exciting fights. the Cro Cop/Aleks fight is one of the best ever, as is the Sergei/Nog and Kondo/Silva fights. Watching Fedor take on Ogawa is also a pleasant treat."
3,No contest,"This is a pretty good fight video but it is disappointing. You may as well know up front that the ""final conflict"" does not happen. You don't get to see it.The ""final conflict"" is the championship fight of the heavyweight tournament. The final four square off on this video, and there are two winners who are supposed to fight for the championship. However the fight does not happen. Instead, one of the fighters, the better one as a matter of fact, gets a nasty head cut from an accidental head collision, and the fight is ruled a ""no contest"".For the faint of heart (like me) be warned that you see some very graphic shots of fingers prying apart the skin on the man's forehead, showing a really bad and deep cut wide open to inspection. The skin is separated a good bit.There are some good fights on the card. It is still worth watching, even though there is no conclusion."
5,Best version of beauty and the beast!,"i love this movie..i loved it as a little girl i would always pretend i was beauty and i just loved how noble and kind she was.. this movie i just cant explain how wonderful it is, you have to buy it if you love great movies, thats all i can say! lol i bought this for me and my little girl to watch (she is 5) i hope she loves it as much as i did when i was a child :)"
4,The Basis of all Beauty & the Beast Stories,"This movie was produced before the Disney movie, and you can see where they got many of their ideas. This movie was produced before the TV show, and again you can see where they got their ideas.It is a creative enchanted look at a fun fantasy! It is worth the money and the time you will spend watching it. And ... if you believe in romance, this is the movie for you! It made a great Valentine's present."
1,I love this movie! Shipping takes forever!,shipping the item takes up to three days and then you will be waiting over a week for it! Very disappointed it takes them so long to ship it!
2,beauty and the beast,i didnt think muvh of this movie wasnt that intresting...music was dull and Rebecca De Mornay cant sing well.the acting isnt to good either. If you were to buy beauty and the beast stick to the disney version
5,Couldn't get more perfect!,"When I was a child I loved this movie so much I obsessed over it. I'd go to the library every day and watch it. I was heartbroken when someone who checked it out destroyed it and they never got another one. I'm 25 now and am overjoyed to finally be able to obtain my own copy of this timeless classic once more.I don't know what it was about this that attracted me so. The magic, the love, the hope. But it's all there and beautifully portrayed. I can't wait for my DVD copy to come in. The cannon movie series--all of it--are perfect movies for any family, of any age."
4,I got a 700 (95th percentile) using this book,"I can't imagine a better way to structure your preparation for the GRE Literature Test than using the strategies McMullen outlines in his book. Although some of the authors McMullen recommends looking at don't appear on the test, almost 85% do. Remember, however, to study your 20th century authors and lit theory as these are appearing in greater quantities on the test every year."
3,This book is no different than the second edition!,"I bought this book for a friend, who told me that the book is exactly the same as the second edition, and so I returned it. The book itself is fine. I read through it, and understood it's organization well enough to see that it would help someone prepare for the subject test in literature. Like most test prep books produced by major publishing houses, it does the job. My gripe is that it has not been improved from the second edition in any important way.The book should have been improved as part of producing the 3rd edition, even if only to make the 3rd edition distinct from the 2nd. Or why bother producing another edition at all?"
2,A necessary evil,"Thinking back, there does seem to have been a gap between what they claimed would feature on the test and what actually did. Is there any better? I'm doubtful that there is, but it probably wouldn't hurt to look."
2,Cheap isn't always good.,"This tire LOOKS great. it has a knobby tread, so if your switching from a smoother brick tread tire, you will feel the differance. i ride ALOT, at least a few miles a day, and this tire lasted a month on the rear, before it seperated from the wire bead, making the tire oblong, and feels like someone is kicking the bike on every rotation. i found some brick tread tires, but they were about twice as much.if your not going to ride alot, i might get these for looks, but these might not be very durable, if my experience is any indication. for the money, they look great. AND i might have just got a bad tire - but cheap isnt always a good thing."
1,The power supply exploded,"In addition to numerous other problems that this laptop has had over the past year, its power supply just EXPLODED.So not only does this laptop have shoddy hardware, it's a fire hazard."
1,Bad Batteries / Bad Motherboards,"I purchased my notebook computer in November of 2001. At the same time I purchased HP's [$$$] 'Support Pack' which extends the warranty to 3 years and guarantees a 3 day turn around time. Fed Ex picks it up and brings it back and HP picks up the shipping. I wasted my moneyI have owned my computer for 12 months and it hasn't worked properly for 8 months. The battery will not fully charge. Sometimes it will charge to only 3%, sometimes to 70%. But it will not fully charge no matter how long you try to charge it.I have performed numerous system calibrations and BIOS upgrades and I have sent it in for repair 3 times...This time they replaced the motherboard. The problem isn't fixed.My computer still doesn't work...Save yourself a huge headache. Buy a computer that works..."
4,Great computer!!!,"I have had my computer for about 3 years and I have never had a problem. It has never been in for a single repair. It has been used frequently by my two teenagers. Maybe I was just lucky?! The battery did go out about 1 year into its life, but no biggie."
2,A disappointment for me,"After all the rave reviews, I couldn't wait to start this book. What a disappointment it was. I found the characters shallow and totally unlikeable, the plot impossible to follow, and in general....just a boring book. I read to the end but now I don't know why I bothered."
2,Sadly Disappointing,"I originally picked up the book because I recently read a book by Katzenbach and absolutely loved it! I would rate it (A Madman's Tale)as one of my all time favorites, so it is obvious to see why I would pick another that he had taken part in. But if not for the proceeds going to the Nature Conservancy I would find it not just a waste of time but also money. And unfortunately it has me not very interested in searching out any of the other authors books. Great concept - dreadful outcome."
5,Awesome,"a classic watch, elegant and perfect gift for you wife.The price was good. The details, the stainless steel and the weight is perfect"
1,bad service,My watch stopped and the company didn't provide an international warranty. the customer said the watch has to be shipped back to the company and i have to cover the cost both ways. very bad service.
3,An oral history. A doctoral thesis.,"Let us put this book into a proper persective. This is not _the_ definitive history of the Holy Oder of MANS, but one man's doctoral dissertation based on selective interviews, the author's gleanings of the interviewees' 15 to 40 year old memories. There is much that is inaccurate, coming from hearsay that someone recalled hearing.The Order had/has a fascinating history and no one else has stepped up to tackle the massive task to document it in it's true fullness and richness. I was a member in multiple capacities from 1969 to 1975, with a brief stint in 1982. I know/knew a fair number of those who were interviewed and many that were not. It has been estimated that the Order touched 10,000 people, to one degree or another.All in all, this is a book worth reading. Just keep in mind what this text is: the author's doctoral dissertation and an oral history with all the shortcomings thereof."
3,A book written for academia about a mystical Order,"Father Paul Blighton taught, and the Order transmitted ""The Middle Path."" Timeless, reaching from ancient wisdom into the coming age; universal and applicable to all.An outside observer might conclude that the Order's teachings incorporated a combination of ideas, but this was not what Order students experienced in their training. We came into a most powerful, integrated experience of Christ in all facets of Being. No frills were added to entertain; only universal truth to transform.The Light emphasized in all of the Order's teachings, is the Light of Illumination, the Christ Light. It can be seen by one who is being mystically transformed by it, and is not merely symbolic. The stated purpose of the Order was to reach as many souls as possible with the transforming Light of Christ."
3,Very little things to laugh at.,"An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig was allright, but Death was just plain bad, I don't even want to go into details with it. I recomend this for only die-hard South park fans."
4,Leave Your Woes Behind...,"This videotape contains episodes 5 & 6 of South Park: ""An Elephant Makes Love To A Pig"": where Kyle's elephant grows too large to ride the bus, so they try to gene-splice the elephant with a pot-bellied pig to reduce its size. Of course things go awry when an evil Stan clone is created from his stolen DNA. And ""Death"", where Stan's 102 year old grandpa yearns for assisted suicide, while his mom is out protesting the kids' (and Death's) favorite TV show about farting: ""Terrance And Philip"". This is the weakest of the first 3 South Park videotapes, and all 3 tapes are definitely not for kids and/or pinheads. END"
2,AN ELEPHANT MAKES LOVE TO A PIG and DEATH,"AN ELEPHANT MAKES LOVE TO A PIG: Occasionally crap eppisode has Stan experimenting what turns out when an elephant screws a pig. DEATH: OK episode has ""Death"" coming to kill Stan's grandpa. More of the same; as I said in my review for VOL. 2 you should get the later videos."
3,Not that great,"Ok, a decent horror/mystery with some brutal killing, but they concentrated too much on the detective aspect of it. I wanted to see more of the town's people and their side of the story. The ending is kind of easy to predict, and doesn't really save the movie. Check it out if you've seen everything else, otherwise I recommend Blood Diner, Phantasm 2, Return of the Living Dead, and anything from the Night of the Living Dead series."
3,Interesting Little Film,"Dead & Buried (1981) has an interesting premise to it. Stangers are murdered in a small coastal town and then suddenly appear as townspeople the next day.I sat through this movie with the highest of hopes. The fact that it was an early 80's horror movie made me jump for joy. I sat through it and patiently watched as I got a wonderful payoff at the end. The ending is the main selling point for this movie. Up until then, the movie had me wondering if it was going to be good or not. The ending is now cliche in today's movie world but back then it was pretty special.This dvd comes with three commentary tracks. And it also has some theatrical trailers.Overall this is a good ghost (or you could say zombie) story ala The Fog."
5,"welcome to potter's bluff,we want you to stay...............forever!!!","i first saw this grim little shocker on cable in the 80's and thought it was great. this 2 disc set is very much worth the price and has a wealth of extras.potter's bluff is a small town with a problem,people keep getting killed in very bad ways,only later to show up as townfolk.sheriff dan gillis is at a lose to explain this and the more he digs the less he likes this little problem.the transfer is great and this little shocker will keep you guessing til the very end(and what an end)!! so if you like your horror movies that are a little out of the normal you'll like this one"
4,Cult Film gets nice treatment!,"I watched this on cable in the 80's and the ending really did surprise me. Local Small town Sheriff has bodies turning up all around him, he fears his wife may be involved somehow, and the local Coroner is a complete Loon. The atmospere in Potter's Bluff is creepy, and there are some very shocking moments to say the least. Overall a highly entertaining movie, especially if you are a fan of low budget 80's horror films - this one is a must see. The 2 disc DVD is nothing but Superb, from the nice Packaging to the Commentaries!"
1,Blu-ray Review,"With so many deserving films awaiting Blu-ray release, why this trifle was chosen is the real mystery. The film, never anything special to begin with, is dated, and aside from bare breast shots seems like a sub-par television movie. As for the Blu-ray transfer, it's terrible. Background lacks clarity and definition, dark scenes are murky, and blue sky, like at the beach-side opening, seems to have smog particles dancing in the air, it's THAT grainy. It looks as if the VHS version was slapped onto disc and the production company said, ""That's good enough."" I bought this DVD at a local resale shop for $5.00 and I still feel ripped off. Acting is passable at best and the ""surprise"" ending is telegraphed ages before the pay-off. Simply put, don't bother."
3,Sorry but cut,"Has anybody else noticed that this film is actually cut? I remember seeing this flick at a festival screening back in the days and noticed a couple of scenes missing or shortened on this Blue Underground version. (same for Near Dark, Anchor Bay)The scene where the syringe is injected into the eye is shortened, the scene where they smash the face of the girl with a rock is actually gone (you should see the stone hitting).Quite a few of these new released horror films (Near Dark and Trauma on Anchor Bay e.g.) feature a somewhat cut version despite the ""Directors Cut"" label. For the ones that are old enough and have had the opportunity to watch these films when they came out or on bootleg, crappy :) but original video might agree with me on this one.I'm not slamming these movies, its great that they are released in high quality and they are classics. Hope to see the ""original"" versions on Blu Ray."
2,Not sure this title warrants a 2-disc deluxe release,"I had fond memories of the film, which I saw once many years ago, and so I thought maybe I'd give this release a try. Well, the movie doesn't really live up to the memory I had of it. It really is something of a trifle, with plot holes so big you could drive a truck through them. The presentation on disc is nice, with a plethora of extras, but there are so many more worthy titles that haven't even been released in even a ""bare bones"" presentation that movies like _Dead & Buried_ really can wait before they make their appearance in deluxe releases. If you're a major fan of this film, this set might be for you. Otherwise, you might want to think twice."
2,Awful,This movie is so awful it would make Roger Corman proud I think. It's amazing it received such high praise from so many others. Could they be zombies?
4,Disturbing!,"If you enjoy really dark horror movies, don't miss this one! The actors and actresses play the parts extremely well and the set is phenomenal. This one will cause nightmares!"
3,Atmosphere is the key here,"Dead & Buried has one major thing going for it; atmosphere. From the opening scene it builds a dreading mood that's sustained for the most part throughout.Acting is very good with a stellar cast and a few very entertaining minor roles occupied by the likes of Robert Englund and Barry Corbin. Gore effects are also solid.Writing is fairly good although there are plot holes you could drive a truck through. The shock ending (albeit a little out there) is a nice touch and the film does have some superp set pieces.But most of all it's the creepy atmosphere in the small coastal town that's the film's real asset and director Sherman milks it for all it's worth.It should be noted that the film was a low budget flick and it shows, especially during the darkest scenes. Sometimes they're pretty hard to make out.Dead & Buried is for the most part mandatory viewing for a horror buff."
1,HP should stick to making printers,"The computer was a problem from the first time I turned it on. Several video flaws, repeated crashes. The touch pad virtually stopped working after a few weeks. The benchmarks are terrible. The worst value for your money."
1,Problems supporting intensive graphic applications!,"I purchased this laptop in late October and since had to return it for repairs 3 times. It worked fine until I tried to run intensive graphic applications. When I sent it back to HP they replaced the hard drive and replaced the touch pad assy. When I got it back it still didn't run intensive graphic applications. HP advised me to install two special patches for the ATI card. After installing the patches, my laptop no longer started. Since I purchased a warranty with my laptop, HP agreed to replace the laptop. Unfortunatly today 3/5, the new laptop I just received won't start! I guess it is another call to HP. My advice is don't buy the HP pavilion ze5185 laptop if you are planning to run intensive graphic applications (business apps or games). After this experience, I will never consider buying another HP laptop."
1,the constant advice that enemas are the cure to all cures irritated me to no end.,"When a book purports to provide ""... causes of civilization diseases ..."", as an avid health practitioner, that's what expect to find within its pages. Instead all I uncovered here was a lame health guide with a mishmash of laughable cures, which was riddled with typos and grammar errors. Additionally, the constant advice that enemas are the cure to all cures irritated me to no end.On the bright side, however, the constant use of enemas and lemons did supply a couple of (probably unintentional) lighter moments. I bought Cure the Incurable following multiple glowing recommendations. It definitely does NOT deliver what it says on the tin, and I wish I hadn't!"
2,Less Crazy After All These Years,"That's right, The Sex Pistols. The original bootleg, and it's amazing how tame it sounds today. These guys are much more respectful of song form than they seemed in the day. They sound angry, but not really self destructive. Interesting. Sound quality ... a little muddy, but one can hear the separate notes, effects and harmonies. The cymbals are not clear in the mix.Well, it's supposed to be punk; to set it up for good speakers would just set the speakers up for icepicking, wouldn't it? Well, it really does sound tame now. It's a good novelty museum piece and something to refer to when wanting to brush up on rock landmarks"
5,A POWERFUL STORY,"Although the VHS tape I received is slightly poor in picture quality, the story of The Fifteen Streets shines through beautifully. This heart-wrenching love story is a rare gem. The performances are powerful to the point of mesmerizing. I laughed and cried and hoped throughout this movie...and I'm a guy! I can't wait for this Catherine Cookson masterpiece to find its way onto DVD."
3,The First Three Were Better,"That's not to say that this one was horrible. I just did not find it quite as interesting as the others. This book mostly revolves around Marcus and Robb. Senior Magician Jaylor had sent the two young journeyman on a mission to bring the dragons of Coronnan back to the kingdom. On their journey, the two magicians are trapped by a spell set to protect a jealous ghost's treasure. Back in the kingdom, Jack is sworn to free the Queen from the cat personality that has been sharing her body and to take his love, Katrina, back to her home land of SeLenicca. While I did not find this book to be as interesting as the other three, it continues the story of the dragons of Coronnan. I'm sure it's a necessary part in the ongoing series, and the ending was rather satisfying."
3,20 Great Love Songs ? Possibly Not !,"The Beach Boys have released a considerable number of best of/greatest hits etc.Of the 20 tracks here I totally agree with 12 of them, eg Don't Worry Baby, Wounld'nt It Be Nice and Surfer Girl.It's the remaining 8 songs which I cannot see as great, eg Why Do Fools Fall In Love, Devoted To You and She Knows Me Too Well.The Boys make a stab at Stevie Wonder's I Was Made To Love Her without being very convincing.So there it is, if you want some rarer songs, maybe this is for you, but watch out for some dubious recording quality."
5,Very interesting!,This is a great read. For anyone wondering what it feels like to convert and why one should convert! Interesting and very informative!
5,A Masterpiece,"A brilliant book philosophical but like an action thriller from the first page till last could not keep it down.Iam a muslim and Mr Lang has very honestly put forth his views and his journey to Islam. I will however not over emphasize his writing capabilities as Mr Lang himself would not like it as he has mentioned in his book.A must read book for all muslims especially as there is the theme in the book which attempts to weave faith with rationalism and modern world ethos.God bless him.I would take an opurtunity in thanking Amazon books for their promise in delivering the book to Saudi Arabia on the mentioned date,Keep it up Amazon."
2,"Dreadfully poor self-publishing, but still of value","This book(let), obviously and badly self-published, is desperately in need of editing, decent formatting, and an overhaul of citation style. It would also benefit from removal of the sketchier flights of fancy toward the end (why did he veer off into such irrelevancies as a denunciation of pasteurized milk?!).That said, it still provides some value in laying out (in purple prose) a case against statins and in providing many potentially useful leads to more information.Malcolm Kendrick's The Great Cholesterol Con is a far, far, FAR better book, and I recommend it instead. The chapter on Statins in The Overdosed American, by John Abramson, is also a very good alternative, among others.I gave two stars for the author's enthusiasm, and for the considerable research he has reported on. But he really should have hired an editor and a book designer before publishing."
4,HMS Rodney,"This work is a detailed account of the career of the HMS Rodney, a vessel with a long career that is little detailed in print.This is a chronological history and contains little technical description of the ship. That being said this book provides the reader with a very complete history of the where and when of this ship and also provides a suitable historical context for the ship and her activities.The Rodney is mentioned in most naval histories for her novel construction and her part in the destruction of the Bismarck but little else of her career. She was a very active vessel in the Royal Navy and this book fills out her history in a very readable format.Well worth the price and the time taken to read it."
1,Worst computer...ever.,"This computer was very dissapointing. I expected a machine that would be easy to use, and would play a part in my everyday life. Instead, we got a machine that is plagued with problems. Some so cripiling, we had to reinstall XP two times. I've had enough...I'm going to Apple. Awful waste of $1,600."
1,"Horrible modem problems - 2nd machine, five reloads -broken!","Horrible problems. Can't use the modem to get to the internet.Not with MSN, not with AOL... Customer support saidreload/rebuild, still didn't work. Comp USA gave us a replacement, which had the identical problem. A few rebuilds later, I'm still wondering if I'll ever get to the internet."
1,Don't waste your money on this,"I have had perhaps 6 Maglite flashlights, all but this one have had a good working switch. This one worked fine when I got it. I did not use it for several weeks and then it did not work. You can fiddle with the head by turning it, sometimes it comes on correctly, sometimes it comes on dim, most of the time it won't come on at all. I think Maglite has a quality control problem so I won't buy any of their products any more."
1,"Started off very bright. Now? Nothing, warranty repair is cost prohibitive","Not sure what happened. The light was very bright for about a year or so, then just went dim. Now? Nothing. This was with household use from my mom.* Tried brand new batteries (1.57V+ each cell),* Tried cleaning the front contact for the battery with an eraser (as suggested by Maglite).No help.The remedy from Maglite is to ship it to Canada insured, cost around $15~$20. But there are alternatives. Cost of nice Coleman flashlight? $20.Unfortunately, Maglite kind of lost a customer.[...]"
1,NO REPLACEMENT BULBS AVAILABLE,"Yes, you heard it here. Unless you purchase the entire replacement ""barrel"" assembly from Mag Instrument (which conveniently contains the light bulb) you essentially have a disposable flashlight.They told me that on the phone last year.That is why Mag LED flashlights are inexpensive (hint).When it worked, it was VERY bright. The compact size works well in a toolbox or glove compartment and you have the equivalent of a 3 D cell mag light.But, if you drop it or the bulb fails, you are out of luck.Based on that issue, it is not qualified for tactical use.Also, as with another review, I had to constantly tap it to get full brightness.This is not what I expect from Mag Lite.Not recommended."
3,OK - not great,"Think about a flashlight made by unknown brand. The maglite brand is misleading - the on off switch works 90% of the time. Controlling the beam condensation is a big BS. Why 3 stars and not 1 - 1. it is working most of the time, when it doesn't - you play with the on off switch. 2. it is cheap"
5,A Great Litte Light,"This is a great little light. It's noticeably brighter than the Maglite 2 AA LED and only a tad less convenient to carry. It will out shine an old Underwater Kinetics 4-C Krypton dive light I've depended on for over 20 years, and battery cost and life is far superior. Clearly this is not a dive light and it clearly is not the equal of the Maglite D cell LED lights either. As with kitchen knives I try to use the right tool for the right job. The Maglite 3 AA LED is a excellent general purpose flashlight that will not cost an arm and a leg to keep in new batteries. You'll be more than satisfied if you buy one."
2,3 cell mini led maglite,"I bought this 3 cell light expecting better, brighter light than my 2 cell LED mini maglite. It doesn't have more, brighter light, it has DIMMER, LESS BRIGHT light than my 2 cell. I feel my money $42 and change was wasted on this. Don't bother buying one of these expecting more light than a 2 cell."
1,"All Hype, not bright..",I own the 3 aa cell light. It is convenient but cannot stand up to the less expensive 2 aa pro..... I contacted Maglite for service and requested an upgrade and was told the light is now discontinued. I just ordered the pro plus aa to replace this light Save your money. The LED must be the first generation. It is disappointing Maglite cannot upgrade for a few bucks.
4,2 cell or 3 cell,"I have them both, great lights very few complaints, no corrosion problems. The internal contacts occasional need cleaning which causes the light to work intermittently just touch them up with a pencil eraser and you're good to go. I think the 2 cell might be a little less bright than the 3 cell but not enough to make a significant difference in normal use. The 2 cell has the multiple power and blink modes which are kind of cool but I don't use them often, more of a gimmick than anything except for the low power mode which could be useful if you are in a situation where you need to conserve battery power. I have had the three cell for several years, and the 2 cell for about a year, no complaints."
2,"Great features, poor reliability","This machine delivered a lot of bang for the buck... or so it seemed.My machine started failing only three months after I took it home. It exhibited intermitted errors with its power switch, and eventually failed to wake up after entering hibernation mode. Sadly, I had to take it into the shop four times over the course of a year -- and on one occasion, it took nearly two months to fix the darned thing.I was eventually forced to spend a fortune on another PC, scarcely 15 months after buying my HP ze4125. I decided that having an unreliable laptop was worse than having no laptop whatsoever.It seemed like a really good buy at the time. If I had only known..."
3,Pretty good....for a PC,"Okay so, I'm a Mac guy...with GOOD reason. I found this to be a stable machine, elegant design, good solid keyboard. Although, no computer is better than it's OS, mine being XP home edition. I personally prefer Windows 2000 pro, (if you held a gun to my head and made me choose a microsoft platform) only because I route AppleTalk over it....XP? No such option. I still have a great LaserWriter Pro that has a lot of life left in it...too bad.But this review is about the laptop, NOT the OS it runs. So I found this machine to be a solid value, although one HUGE item is missing: FIREWIRE (or, for you peecee folks) 1394.It is for that reason that I only gave it 3 out of 5 stars....they kept the ps2 slots but omitted the firewire port.With manufacturers falling over themselves to adopt the faster, more stable ""firewire"" connectivity, I found this to be an omission of ignorance on HP's part."
4,One for those on shrooms or getting high on weed,Very chilled out! Quite a journey of breaks and downtempo beats. I've seen the Baroness live and this is as good as she was then. My ONLY complaint about this mix is the last cut. SHe cuts over VERY quickly to it and disrupts the smooth flow she had going the whole time. Oh well : (The second Electric Manor is as good as this one and keeps a smooth flow through out the whole CD. I recommend you check that one out too if you liked this one.
5,pronounced (kally goola),"After my fourth bratworst, I began to find this movie hard to swallow. For instance, why the sheet and the grapes on his head? Aren't corporate attorneys supposed to wear business suits? Meanwhile, I having a coronary (and another brat) while this shmutz on my tv pulls back his sheets and starts swinging his cooyons at the hired help. I did however enjoy the subplot which involves Caligula's psychosis wrestling with the age-old problem: I can't figure out why in the hell everyone is watching me and then when I catch them, they deny it vehemently. I gave this video five stars because its something the whole family can watch while I'm out cruisin for chicks."
4,Bushwacker Cut-Out Jeep XJ flairs,"Great product, new textured black finish looks great right out of the box! Install is DIFFICULT on these but worth the effort... and if you have rusty wheel wheels this is a great ""fix"" and gives you room for bigger tires without rubbing! If you offroad, these are a must have... AMAZON had the best price!!!"
4,Language enrichment value of Jasper's beanstalk,"I like this book for language therapy with preschoolers. Because it is very simple, with few words, it helps the child clue in to the new vocabulary which includes days of the week and some great verbs. I use it to teach regular past tense (Jasper planted, Jasper watered, etc.) and in a different setting present progressive (Jasper is planting, Jasper is watering...) The kids enjoy it and don't realize how much they are learning!"
3,Its just rather...odd,"Hmmm, I've finished this book a couple days ago and I'm still not sure whether I liked it or not. It was definately entertaining, and it pulled me in and kept me up to late. But first it started out like a pleasant fantasy story...a mysterious aunt, a maybe magic doll, an imaginary horse. And then there is some kind of freaky teen experience. Then it gets really normal for a while..just a pretty regular relationship between the woman and an ordinary man, who is not so wonderful as her illusions have made him out to be. And then....it gets really darn freaky for a bit..not sure if I want to spoil it for anyone but there is a distinct ""ewwwww"" factor to one bit. But I kept reading to the end, hoping it would all make sense by the end and...well it never quite did. I'm not sure whether the main character is some sort of magical witchy person, or just plain mentally ill, or what. So it kind of left me quite disappointed at the end. THe finish was a big let down."
2,waste of time,"I found the premise of this story intriguing, but I was disappointed. The story was disjointed and made no sense. I'm sorry I wasted my money."
5,"Cool book,Loved it!","If you're looking for a good book to pass time, pick this one up. My favorite story is ""A Feline Felony"" by Lael J. Littke. Jerome Kotter was a cat. He walked, talked, and acted like a human though. He grew up living a pretty happy, normal life except for one guy, Benny Rhoades, who made Jerome's life miserable. Jerome survives school and gets a nice job with a nice secretary. He fogets about Benny. One day Benny shows up and he has gotten a job in the mail room. Jerome can't believe it. Latter that week, Jerome and his secretary, Marie, were settled down for a pleasant evening when Benny burst in. He had a gun! Jerome didn't think, he leaped into the air, Benny . . . you'll have to read the story to find out what happens."
1,A PEICE OFJUNK !,IT`S ADVERTISED AS USB 2.0 -- THIS IS THE SLOWEST TRANSFER RATE YOU CAN IMAGINE. I TRIED IT ON 8 DIFFERENT USB PORTS ON 3 DIFFERENT COMPUTERS -SLOW-SLOW-SLOW !! I HAVE 2 OTHER TRAVEL DRIVES WITH 256MB & 512MB AND THEY WORK GREAT.TRIED TO TRANFER ABOUT 1 GIG OF DATA AND IT TOOK OVER 1 AND HALF HOURS !! JUST JUNK -- DON`T BUY!
3,"this wasn't the worst,,,","...children's book I have read about Ireland. It was much better than some of the others, but not great. It uses all stock photography, which is typical. This book's best feature is the map on page 42, which is quite legible, but not great. All said, I can't imagine any child feeling a warmth in her/his heart for Ireland after reading this book. It was a big snooze."
1,False Advertisement,"So disappointed...This CD does not sound like Ruben Gonzalez at all. It features too much trumpet and you can't hear Ruben at all. Why put his name on the CD if you can't hear his piano playing? I go 100% with ""Introducing Ruben Gonzalez"" and ""Indestructible"" but I was compelled to send ""Sentimiento"" back. Bad News. It sounds to me like you put his name on the CD just to be able to sell it! Sorry!Katy K."
2,Take care,"This record is a perfectly good one, but it is by a Ruben Gonzalez not at all connected with the one who has become well known through the Buena Vista Social club."
5,Incredible story of God's work in a the life of a young boy,"Filled with extensive historical information, The British Josiah takes the reader back to the time of Wycliffe and shows what events led up to Edward's reign, details Edward's life and time as king, and then summarizes the effect which Edward's reign had on the country through the following centuries.Though I had researched both the Reformation and the House of Tudor before, nowhere had I found hints of Edward's remarkable wisdom and godliness. My would-be doubts about this book's accuracy were swept away by the fact that Woychuk makes most of his statements through direct quotes from those he is referring to.Except that some of these quotes take a high reading level, The British Josiah was very understandable and enjoyable. I and my eleven-year-old brother with whom I read it were inspired, convicted, and encouraged by this incredible story. It not only taught us history but amazed us by God's power and work."
4,A good effort,"Having seen the Floating Men in concert several times and owning all their albums, I have seen the Floating Men at their best. This CD brings to the listener all of the feeling that comes from one of their concerts, but a new listener will be disappointed with the sound quality of the last three songs. These songs trully do sound like they are bootlegged. Otherwise, this album like all of the Floating Men albums, is great. THe careful intermix of new material and their olld standards is wonderful. The introduction piece to East of the Sunrise is perhaps the best thing I have ever heard by Jeff Holmes. The one new song Smoking in the Grocery Line is a typical Flloating Men song, telling a story with precision and depth. If you are a Floating Men fan this CD is a must."
2,Not as good as Physical Chemistry,"Okay, I'll admit that my background in quantum chemistry is pretty sketchy. However I feel much more lost than usual in this book when it comes to understanding the phenomena that they're trying to model. The problems at the back and the solutions that come with the 3rd edition of this book are even worse as he jumps around alot and don't teach you how to think about problems, just random ways of solving it. I guess this is an intermediate quantum course but I feel safer with Levine, which I used in undergrad physical chemistry. He/she (not sure if Ira is a guy) at least goes through the math so that you can follow it pretty easily. Atkins... Not my cup of tea!"
4,Necessary,Useful and clear book about molecular quantum mechanics......For a material scientist it's the second book of the triptych: Cohen - Atkins - Kittel
2,?,"Buy McQuarrie and Simon's ""Physical Chemistry"" or Griffith's ""Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"" instead of this book. The book is too concise, and it skips a considerable amount of math. The math is awkwardly addressed in his Mathematical Background and Further Information chapters. Also, the book is, overall, harder to understand. It may be the way the way the author words the sentences or the notation he uses for equations. I have spent hours trying to decipher what the author was trying to say in several chapters. I felt cheated on the time that I had to spent on this book to understand the concepts it illustrated."
2,Heavily marred by the author's protastant view.,I cannot recommend this book to anyone other then those who have to read it for assigned course work. The outlines of the prophetic books are good but other then that I did not think the Author takes into consideration the large volume of Church tradition that assisted in understanding the Old and New Testaments correctly.
1,not terribly useful,"I found this book syrupy and narrow-viewed; some of the vows were just bizarre and histrionic. It was also dominantly Christian, which was not what I was looking for. I was disappointed. If you want a truly interesting and varied book of wedding vow suggestions, try ""Alternative Weddings: An Essential Guide to Creating Your Own Ceremony"". It's a lot more genuine and offers a much wider range of ideas.Alternative Weddings: An Essential Guide for Creating Your Own Ceremony"
2,Compare first,"I compared a few wedding vow books and although I thank all the authors for their efforts, the one I found the most useful, comprehensive, progressive in thinking, and with a generous mix of both spiritual and secular vows is ""With These Words...I Thee Wed"". Guess that's why it's been around the longest."
1,USELESS: God God God - very dramatically Christian!,"I was appalled when I flipped through this book to find that just about every sample vow uses the words ""God,"" ""His,"" and ""Holy Spirit."" There is no room for other faiths, or for secularism, in this book - quite incomplete! I bought the book for the chapter on Second Marriages, which is my situation. Unfortunately, this book assumes that if you are getting married you must have been through a tragedy that left you near suicidal. The second marriage vows are sickeningly co-dependent, very dramatic ('you put an end to my torment, heal the wounds, dash the flames of punishment;' sheesh!), not joyous at all. How about those of us that had a healthy divorce, or moved on after widowhood? Also note: there are no guidelines for building your own vows, merely tons of example vows for you to plagiarize. I found this to be a completely useless book of wedding vows."
4,"Great to get ideas, but still write your own!","I was able to use this book to get some good ideas on what type of things my fiance and I would like to say on our wedding day, but this book just gave us ideas. We haven't decided what to say to each other yet, but we know that we will not use one of her examples word for word. It was a great starting tool, but now my fiance and I need to get a little creative and write our vows from the heart and not copy them from this book."
4,Traditional Vows,"This book offers many ""traditional vows"". And choices from all types of faiths (most are Christian). Readings are also traditional. I would have liked to have seen more choices in all faiths."
5,24 Celtic and Medieval Display Fonts (Dover Electronic Display Fonts for Macintosh and Windows) (Book and CD-ROM),"Love, love, love that there is a color view of the border/designs and a line drawing as well as some instruction on how to create some of the designs."
5,Looking for something different?,"I don't know how to do calligraphy and I don't think you need to with this book. This book spends a lot of time on the illumination of the the letters and the borders. I do a lot of drawing and always wanted something a little different to use in my backgrounds and/or titles and this book really gave me a great place to find ideas and inspiration. If you do calligraphy, this is a great and I think must have book. If you don't you can still get a great deal out of it and think it really belongs in any artists library."
2,I've seen better,"This book is useful for the amateur. For those who already have experience with calligraphy, illumination, etc, this book leaves much to be desired."
5,Wonderful gift,I bought this as a gift for a illumination craft person and she adores the book. Provides inspiration into the various letters used in manuscript illumination. Excellent resource for the reference library.
3,A classic lesson in tragedy,"Lost love can so damage the mind that the physical person becomes barely recognizable. This story is a great example of how some people change after lost love while other become stuck at the mental point of abandonment. When the abandonment is resolved, the shock is so great, the physical shell which has held things together for so long, cannot handle the shock, shattering completely."
5,An exciting adventure in Russia,"Balzac guided European fiction away from the overriding influence of Walter Scott and the Gothic school, by showing that modern life could be recounted as vividly as Scott recounted his historical tales, and that mystery and intrigue did not need ghosts and crumbling castles for props. Maupassant, Flaubert and Zola were writers of the next generation who were directly influenced by him, and Marcel Proust (that other weaver of a great tapestry) acknowledged his influence.He is worth reading for pleasure as well as for his influence on European literature."
4,My Grayson family relatives,"First of all, I am a descendant of my great-great grandparents, Doc Grayson and Susan Harjo Grayson. Their son James L. Grayson was the father of my grandmother. I recall my grandmother,Virey Grayson(1889-1971) telling me about life in Indian Territory.The book Black, white, and Indian written by Claudio Saunt was brought to my attention by another relative presented information about relatives I know and others I did not now.The book is a must read for anyone interested history not told in American history books."
5,Talented agression from people who knows how to do it,"Amazing debut from this band formed by pretty talented musicians such as Samoth and Trym from the almost dead black metal gods Emperor..., this cd shows Samoth's great technical riffs and high speed execution... Trym's work is incredible and Daemon's vocals (he is the singer of Limbonic Art too as you all know) are very well done and they're a good combination with the band's sound, impressive for a debut, and a great death/black album if compared with the best ones in this genre."
4,"OK, I Fell in Love with Its Look but Great Customer Service","I bought this computer on impulse-- stupid, huh? But I thought it looked really sharp on display so I got the last one on the shelf and toted it home.Two months later the power source died. I went to the Sony website in a far from concilatory mood. By the time I finished with the CS rep I was almost happy. Ok, I was a lot less unhappy. It was a known problem. They sent me a box to mail it back in (postage paid). I had my computer back in four days. They extended the warranty for two years and I got a free handheld in the mail about a week later. (Oh, yeah, and I could have got a refund of the total price.)Nice job, Sony."
5,non-stop suspense,"Thank you Ms. Aczon for forwarding me a copy of your debut novel. I can't believe that a traditional publisher has not picked up your book!! I'm not even a horror/suspense reader, however, after reading an on-line excerpt I was intrigued enough to order a free copy. You did not let me down. In fact, the excerpt chapter I read didn't do enough justice for the entire book. The book was so captivating that I stayed up late reading the book and took it to work to read the next day during my breaks and lunch hour. I finished the book in four hours. I've since loaned out my copy to others in my reading group and have also recommended this book to other girlfriends. Thank you so much for introducing these wonderful characters to us and I can't wait to BUY your next book."
3,Okay for a beginner home user or student.,"This computer did us well as a starter home user and with a high school student, but as we progressed my husband needed to add some big office software. The computer came with Norton 2002 anti-virus which slowed the system down considerably. When I took it out it speeded up the system by about 30 percent. Then I changed the setting to ""adjust for performance"" instead of ""adjust for appearance"" and sure it was ugly then but 30 percent faster even yet. The Celeron is slow compared to the Pentium 3 or Pentium 4. 256 mgs of memory should be upgraded if you get tired of this computer freezing up everytime you want to use more than one app. at a time. It doesn't have the juice. So we are going to sell this one and upgrade to a Dell for the same price with a P4 and add a 512 of memory chip. I still would recommend this computer for your family and kids as a starter for the price. ..."
4,Alisha wants to be a star--and I want her to be one too!!,"Prior to the release of ""You Wanna Be A Star"", it had been nearly a decade since Alisha's last studio album, 1990's ""Bounce Back"". I can only imagine that poor record sales are why it has taken this long in order for her to get another ""deal"" (so to speak), and include this single on the ""Superstar"" soundtrack. Though nearly 10 years had passed since I had heard anything new from Alisha, I must say this CD is proof positive that she still has that unique voice.I have only 3 Alisha albums of which I am aware: ""Alisha"", ""Nightwalkin'"" and ""Bounce Back"". Since all of these CDs are on different labels, I guess Alisha hop-scotched around from label to label, hoping to find a long-term deal. It is a shame that she has not seemed successful in this effort--especially when there are artists with far less vocal talent with major record deals. Oh well, keep trying, Alisha. I still love you!"
4,Return of the elusive Alisha!,"This is the ""come back"" single from Alisha. You might remember Alisha hits like ""Baby Talk"" and ""All Night Passion,"" or you may remember the movie Mannequin, and when the two are dancing to that dancey song ""Do You Dream About Me?""Overall... this is a pretty good single. This song has some tacky lyrics in some parts but it's a good dancey, Alisha-type song. This was also included on the ""Superstar"" movie soundtrack."
5,A new favorite,"When I recently started getting into mystery novels, a friend recommended Joe Lansdale's Hap & Leonard books....I've read three novels in the series so far, and I love them. I'm from Texas, and though Lansdale never pretties up East Texas, showing it warts and all, I still feel a warm, at-home feeling.I've known people very much like Hap and Leonard, and while these characters feel real, they also serve as cultural icons--like some other detective-novel protagonists (such as Spenser and Hawk, Elvis Cole and Pike, Phil Marlowe, and others), they represent what is best in people. They show how people ought to treat each other. And like the best of those, they have their flaws. We can take them as heroes, but also relate to them."
4,Lansdale is the king,"Since discovering Lansdale earlier this year, I've read everythign i can get my hands on. i even visit his website once a week because he posts a new short story every Thrursday. The guy is simply amazing. By and far the best writer I've read in a long time, simply hilarious.Hap and Leonard are two of the coolest characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about. One white trash, the other a black gay man. together they're two of the toughest honchos to ever clean up a neighborhood. I can't wait for the movie (though I'm sure it'll be crap in comparison).Only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five is that the mystery is a bit easy to solve. But it dosesn't realy matter because it's such a fun read. And now that Bubba Ho tep has been made into film (an amazingly funny film at that) you can expect to see a lot of lansdale's work translated to the screen."
4,A different kind of hard-boiled,"Lansdale writes tough, and this book has some of the most effective and sinewy descriptions of close-in, bareknuckle conflict you'll find. The unlikely pair of protaganists are much more than action heroes, though: they manage to be quirky, philosophical, and prone to late-night conversations that ring of true friendship. The secondary characters are well-drawn as well, particularly the elderly neighbor and a pair of policemen who provide something of a mirror-image to the main duo. The nature of the characters and their relationships yield blunt yet astute commentary on matters of race, sex, and justice.The only real weakness here is the central mystery, which is a bit telegraphed and overwrought. One gets the feeling that Lansdale might have done better with a straight storyline, which these characters could easily carry."
5,One bad mother mystery writer too!,"This is the first book that I picked up (very accidental) a good cover will draw your eyes! by Joe Lansdale. I had not picked up a book to read for several years and this book re-opened my eyes to the adventures of reading and what can happen when you are drawn into characters so well thought out and totally entertaining. A spooky and loveable story and what a stew of a mystery about two male friends,(one straight, and one gay) an inherited old house, something dead under the floor boards. This is a GREAT STORY and I am so glad I came apon this talented writer from Texas."
2,makes noise,Bearing fit fine and works but makes noise while driving.Probably is defective but too difficult to return.Even though the price was great I'll most likely pass on ever buying auto parts from Amazon again.
5,A must read for all therapists!,"David Shapiro's work has been well known in the field of psychotherapy. His earlier works, Neurotic Styles and Autonomy and Rigid Character, became instant classics as they appeared. In this third book Shapiro delineates his character analytic approach to therapy in the tradition of Helmut Kaiser. Following the theoretical discourse in the first chapter, he explains his major thesis eloquently: the patient him/herself is the therapeutic material. In so doing, Shapiro provides many examples, probably his own as a gifted therapist, that make this book highly readable. I have assigned this book to my interns who are interested in learning the art of therapy. Shapiro is a true master! I highly recommend this book to the readers of this review."
1,More fiction than fact.,"This is not a very good book. If your looking at this title then I'm sure your interest is in self-defense. Using a straight razor is not a very effective method. This is a book that was written for the sake of writing. A better book that is written by the same author is ""No Second Chance"", this title gives much better information. Buy this book only if you are in the habit of collecting martial art type books."
1,This book was not very informative.,"I find that this book contains nothing really helpful to the person who already has a basic knowledge of straight razors, & the human anatomy. Sorry to have to place such a unfavorable review. True"
2,Author should stick to writing about the 1911,"My review on this one is going to be a bit more critical than most. This is probably one of the worst books on Glock pistols that I have read to date. The author is constantly comparing Glocks to 1911's, and other types of pistols. The book is also loaded with plenty of non-Glock images. Mr. Sweeney, I bought this book because I like the Glock, not because I wanted to see plenty of photos of 1911's... ad nauseam. Perhaps Mr. Sweeney should stick to books writing books like his ""Gun Digest Book of the 1911"", as he has done Glock more than a bit of injustice.You know, I recently purchased Massad Ayoob's excellent book ""The Gun Digest Book of Sig-Sauer"". Mr. Sweeney, please take note... Massad's book on the Sig is FILLED with useful information and photos related to his book's title... SIG-SAUER PISTOLS!Sorry, but I must recommend a pass on Sweeney's ""sort of Glock"" book!Hans"
3,"Good Glocking Information, but....","This book has a TON of information about the Glock pistols. My only complaint is the author's continuous reference to 1911 pistols. He is an admitted fan who dwells way too much on the 1911 and is continuously comparing it to the Glock. This book would have been better written by someone with a more neutral view. Granted, the author is not continually bashing Glocks (he actually speaks highly of them), but I didn't buy it to read about 1911's.If you're new to Glocks, as I am, I would still recommend this book to you. As I said, TONS of useful info ...you just need to wade through the 1911 talk to get to it."
3,Caution: Same book as 1st 2003 Edition,"I bought this 2nd edition of the Gun Digest Book of the Glock, published in 2008 thinking it would be a new and different edition. Unfortunately the 2008 2nd edition is exactly the same book as the 2003 1st edition except for the cover. The 2nd edition contains the same text, the same black and white photos, the same identical chapters as the earlier 1st edition. There is nothing new in this book.It's a fine book with lots of useful information, but re-packaging an older edition without any updates in it is a bit deceiving. If you have the original edition, forget this one. It's the same book."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book was greatly disappointing! I've spent weeks drooling over this book thinking it would teach the new Glock owner everything they would need to know. Far from it. It does tell you all the inner workings, great. Covers all the models, great. Even gives you history of Glock, great. Covers Cleaning, maintenance, proper care...WAIT, NO IT DOES NOT. IT TELLS NOTHING OF HOW TO CARE FOR YOU WEAPON! I WANT A REFUND! I wasted $28.00. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Look elsewhere. But if you insist on throwing your money away, you can send it to me."
4,Glock Vol. 2 by Pat Sweeney,"I have read Vol. 1, and a number of his other books. I found it interesting and was not bothered by the references to the 1911 pattern pistols."
4,"The Gun Digest Book of the Glock, 2nd Edition",Nice book but need improvement about the color pictures.John
5,Glock - Patrick Sweeney,"Used the book to help make decision on 1911 vs Glock Platform for recent handgun purchase. Excellent history of the Glock, great details on each model and how to customize the glock. Good Read....very helpful. Mailed book to my brother who is a Glock-a-holic...he liked it too. After shooting the Glock and the 1911-A1....I puchased 1911-A1 45 and 1911-A1 in 22 cal. The Glock is great....but the 1911 frame fit my hand and felt more natural to shoot. Still in the market for a 9mm and might still add a glock to the mix."
1,not as good as the others,"I have all the cannon movies that are available on DVD and I can honestly say that this one is my least favorite. The opening scene should have tipped me off when they were drowning prisoners and trying to make it seem humorous. None of the acting was very good, it was like they were trying too hard. The love relationship between the thief and the princess was so lame and without chemistry. Cheesy sound effects like springs and slide whistles were used throughout the film which made it all appear so unprofessional. It was supposed to be used to create humor, but it only appeared to be ridiculous. The ending was rushed and too perfectly handled. Thank goodness the other Canon movies aren't like this, because this one was just plain stupid."
5,Perfect Condition,Poster came in perfect condition! Still looks great after 2 years and a move from one house to another! Love it!
3,One Review was VERY misleading!,"We bought this as a gift for our dauther in law. One of the previous reviews says:The poster in comes in a triangular poster shipping tube and includes 2 plastic crimps for either end of the poster for good hanging and, also, bottom weight to prevent curling of the poster on your wall.PLEASE NOTE: This poster DID NOT come as this person says. It came in a round poster tube and it was just the poster. There was NO triangular tube, NO plastic crimps and NO bottom weights.The reason I chose this item was due to this review...We ended up going out and purchasing a $40 frame for the poster since the review was SO misleading!!!"
5,Out of the Ordinary,"This is an extraordinary CD. Twelve-year old James Rainbird recorded these songs with piano accompaniment in the 1980s for a small British recording label. His technique, musicianship, and understanding of words and music are astonishing for someone his age. He does wonders with the opening early baroque songs by Dowland and Rosseter. The performance of Purcell's timeless ""Music for a While"" is at once majestic and touching. Britten's two Paul Bunyan ballads are simply irresistible, even if he gets a little tired, and his rendering of the Barber song ""Sure on this Shining Night"" towards the end is memorable. Strongly recommended."
5,For Tolkien's die-hard fans!,"It may be difficult to diggest if your are not into Tolkien, and more specifically, if you are not a die-hard fan of The Lord of the Rings. But if you are a fan, not only you will find this book very informative, but you will devour it from cover to cover!"
2,Pay no attention to that book behind the Rings.,"The cover of this book says it is ""delightful"". I found it to be less than that.That seems to be all I can remember about this book. That tells me more."
3,"Good for every day use, not a deep conditioner","So I found this in the clearance section of Ulta and decided to buy it for $4 (normally $14, so it was a steal) I have very dry, damaged hair that is on it's way to recovery and decided to try this product to help the process. I showered, left it in for 5-7 minutes, and rinsed out. It came out very thick and rich, had a smell I cannot quite place, but the moment I put it in my hair I could tell it wasn't going to be what I was hoping. I had to use a ton to cover my hair, it didn't detangle very well, and when I rinsed it out it took ages to get the product out of my hair and my hair didn't feel as soft or slick in the shower as it normally does when I use a deep conditioner. While I would say this is an okay/good every day conditioner for damaged hair, in my eyes it is NOT a deep conditioner. I will continue to use it as such and will still be counting on my other deep conditioner (One 'N Only Moroccan Argan Oil Restorative Mask)."
3,fell apart after a few months,i loved the gun when i first got it was was powerful and worked perfectly for air-soft wars but after a few months of use the part you pull back to load the gun just cracked and popped off and the insides fell out. great gun at the time it was working. and the ironic thing is it broke a few days after the warranty expired
1,Please do not buy this,"This gun is horrible. I bought it about a week ago and have been regretting it ever since! The plastic is cheap, the trigger sticks to the point where I cant shoot it, and when you pull it back, the slide pinches your hand in it. It pinched me so badly I started bleeding."
1,WORST EVER,"WORST THING YOU COULD SHOOT,MOST INACURRATE PISTOL EVER COULDN'T HIT A SOLO CUP AT TEN FEET 200RDS MAYBE 3 TIMES BB'S FLY EVERYWHERE. BEEN SHOOTING REAL GUNS FOR OVER 40YRS.THIS IS JUNK,GET A NERF GUN MORE ACCURATE.CONTACTED UNAREX ,WAITING FOR AN ANSWER.ALL THE REVIEWS READ MUST BE A MISTAKE. SAVE YOUR $$ BUY A REAL GUN."
3,good...,This was a very good gun 300 fps.it had okay accuracy the only thing bad was when i had it for 1 month all of a sudden it just stopped cocking!over all look a little more...
3,Its not the Best,"This gun was pretty good. It has 300 fps with a .12 bb. The bad thing about this gun is that it is not accurate, not even with a .20 bb. The reason it sucks with accuracy is because the gun is small, it has a small barrel. Compared with my friends pistol is is about a good inch shorter so this gun is for close range shooting. Oh and by the way if you ever shoot this gun at a can from point blank range it will not make a whole."
3,airsoft,Great gun but when I took it out of the package the silencer broke off along with the tip of the gun. But it is a very accurate and it hurts like poop.
5,Excellent gun,"I really can't stress how great this gun is.I'm really into airsoft guns, and I know that almost MOST guns (be it a rifle or pistol) that are $20 bucks or under are pretty much crap. This pistol is EASILY better then MOST of the $20-$30 dollar RIFLES I've seen. If you want a reliable gun that's cheap and will shoot admirablly, then buy this.Pros:- 300 fps (that's GREAT for a $20 dollar pistol)- shake-and-load clips (these hold possibly a hundred bbs)- well-built- has a few metal parts- is accurate (with .20 bbs - don't bother with .12s)Cons:??I'll adimt: my gun broke after 2 years of very ruff play and I fired lots of dry rounds with it (don't fire empty rounds /w a airsoft gun. This is not good for it.)The gun is twenty bucks people! Buy it! I gurantee you'll get your money's worth!!"
4,Walther P99 Airsoft Pistol,"The air pistol is kind of a pain to cock, but is very accurate. Good power.I would recommend this gun."
5,"Very Accurate, Fast, Exellent Gun","I Love this pistol! It Is super accurate and holds quite alot of ammo in 1 clip (and theres 2!). And it makes a great beginner gun. It is especialy sturdy and I love the metal trigger system. I defenitly would recommend this gun to all beginners and airsoft""ers""!"
5,This Is A Very Good Book!!!,"It is about the Princess Rebecca Pocahontas, Princess Of Peace. It is based on real facts and is very aventurus. About 6 years goes by in this book and all that time she has many aventures. I do not really like history but i like Pocahontas and her story almost sonds like made up story but really happend."
4,tells her thoughts,I like this book because Pocahontas tells her thoughts and other things that are going on.
5,Americana Personified!,"""Into the Tiger's Jaw"" is a literary knitting which weaves together the best and the worst of the American fabric. Yet, it so dramatically displays the opportunities of which General Peterson availed himself that it inspires every reader to recognize and take advantage of all that is offered to each of us on a daily basis. This book is not only an inspiration, it is a lesson in history. A lesson which causes feelings of pride in the accomplishments of an outstanding Black American and gives us hope for the future."
5,"Frank Petersen, a true Marine & a part of our history","This is an important book for all readers who want to understand the history of this great Republic. Although he does not want to be known as the first black Marine aviator or the first black Marine general, Frank Petersen, nonetheless, occupies a signficant place in American history because of his achievements. He does not want to be known as a pioneer, a trailblazer, or a point man in the fight for racial equality; he wants to simply be known as a leader, and most of all...a loyal Marine. He served his country in far more ways than most people realize and in ways hard for many to comprehend. We are a better country -- a better Republic -- and certainly we have a better Corps because of the service of this Marine. This should be required reading for any academic or education course on the struggle against racial injustice and the triumph of perseverance, reason and a steady hand against the forces of prejudice and hatred. Semper Fidelis, Marine."
5,"Fantastic flight of fancy, Exciting engineers epoch!","I have read all 5 books of this series dozens of times. I can honestly say that I am deeply upset with Mr. Frankowski, for NOT continuing his fabulous chronicles of Conrad Stargard. I have introduced many a friend to the SF genre, via my poor page worn sets."
2,Nice screw,A person can never have too many nice screws in their lifetime and these babies have found many good uses.
1,Item shipped with missing parts... TWICE.,"My first order for two of these were thrown into a big box and the screw had been lost to one. When I returned it and got a replacement, it was packed carefully in a padded envelope but IT WAS MISSING A WASHER. So just forget about ordering this item from these guys."
4,History teacher,"At first I was a little hesitant to read a book of short stories written by my former history teacher, but in truth I was not surprised. I expected this high quality selection of works to not only be worth my time, but a very rewarding read. I recommend it to anyone looking to broaden their literary horizons. Keep doing what you do Mr. Parmalee."
3,"Works fine, but not as easy to set up as expected.","I expected this case to be marker-specific to the A5, as that's what I'd searched for. I wish the company had provided pictures of how the marker should be installed.Suffice to say, it works. In fact, by being a bit creative, my Spyder fits in there as well, so in some ways it was a bonus. I can carry two markers in one case now, which is nice.Construction quality is fine. Nothing special, but not horrid. Hopefully it'll last a nice long time."
4,Marker Case,I just got this case and so far I'm happy with it. I bought a different case for my son and this one is much better. I would like to find a case just for the 98 custom though. I think this one would fit the A-5 a little better. I would definitely reccommend this case.
5,Addicted to this book,"I actually have Asking For Trouble on audiobook, and I have probably listened to it at least four times now. I never get tired of this book!"
1,Nasty... not in a good way.,"This is one of the worst Black Lace books I have ever read. Ilya, the main partner of the heroine, Beth, is a jerk. I pitied Beth more than I wanted to be in her place. Most of the sex scenes are degrading--not arousing. I was surprised at the overall dismalness of this novel considering that I found Ms. Lloyd's other Black Lace novel, Darker Than Love, quite enjoyable. Don't waste your money. Buy an Emma Holly or Natasha Rostova title or the aforementioned Darker Than Love instead."
4,A wide range of interesting people,"I really enjoyed this book - it is very story driven in that there are numerous unexpected twists and turns so it is not predictable, as so many family sagas are. The characters are interesting and the story rings true. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys generational novels. I particularly liked the way the author wove together many different types of people, ranging from Jews emigrating from Europe, to the Chinese laborers in Montana to a madam of a brothel. Their interactions, misunderstandings and camaraderie made for interesting, page turning material."
1,Don't bother,The mount for this lock is a piece of crap. We tried it on three different bikes without success. It is nearly impossible to get it placed without interfering with something. It's heavy and the fabric strap just doesn't stay put. The mount is large and cantilevers the lock out so far that it can't easily be placed on the inside of the frame. Unless you have a very large frame you'll have trouble.
1,"Possibly good lock, mounting backet is useless","U-locks shouldn't be attached to the bike with nylon fabric. Come on!The bracket wouldn't hold the lock worth a damn, and finally broke while trying to adjust it (both a plastic piece holding the strap broke, and the screws that tighten the fabric stripped easily.Also, there's an orange plastic clip that's apparently supposed to hold the lock to the bracket (after it slides on). It doesn't snap on, nor is it spring loaded (maybe it's supposed to be?), so even if the bracket worked the lock would slide right off if pulled.At least the lock itself seems usable if you have another way to carry it."
1,What the LOCK?!,"Mine broke today to much annoyance. Like others have mentioned, the plastic inside can break in half.Going with a different brand...just wish I had read these reviews first."
1,Can I get a refund?,"Uh, I had to walk two miles home in the ""cold""... because this lock doesn't work as soon as it dips below 45 degrees? My key seized up in the lock at a temperature well above freezing? Sorry, I can never trust the mechanism again. Won't re-use unless I'm sure I don't need my bike for a while. I'm serious about the refund."
3,4 years and now issues,"I just posted a review for this lock with 5 stars after having it work great for 4+ years. Then less than 2 months after postng the review I had a total lock failure. My bike is currently locked to a bike rack 7 miles away from my house. I'm not sure what happened. This morning it locked up fine, and then when I came out to go home the lock won't turn over. I even got some wd-40 and lubricated the inside, but nothing worked.So I'm a little pissed off right now, and wanted to let people know what I experienced.Update: The next morning after lubricating the inner mechanism I got the lock to turn over. Added some more lubricant and it seems to be turning ok again. Not sure if I trust it now though.I'm giving it 3 stars since it did work perfectly for 4+ years and I'm still going to use it."
2,"Decent lock, bracket fell apart quickly","The plastic they use for the bracket on this lock is not suited for the task. I got it to attach to my frame no problem, and the lock itself seemed OK. However within a few weeks the thin plastic that held the brackets together completely fell apart, breaking apart piece by piece. It got so that it would no longer hold the lock.If you intend to mount the lock on your frame, don't buy this lock, period. I've heard that this is a common occurrence, but if it is not, please take my experience as a warning.I have since acquired another lock with a very similar bracket system that's proved durable over a few months.If OnGuard fixed the bracket plastic this would be a worthy item."
3,Not a $55 piece of equipment...,"I just purchased this lock and was disappointed in it. It did not seem like a $55 piece of equipment, although I did only pay $29 for it (because Amazon was having a sale). However, I still feel like it is only maybe a $10-20 piece of equipment. Things I am unhappy with: (1)some parts seem to be made of shoddy plastic, (2)there is no list of the items included and so I feel like I am missing components, (3)you need an allen wrench to mount the bracket and it doesn't come with one, (4)the keys seem cheap (cheap metal/cheap plastic), (5) the instructions are hardly informative or helpful.Pluses:(1) there are five keys, one with a light (but this does seem excessive), (2) they provide you with a list of pros and cons of where to mount the bracket/lock on your bike (but it will probably only fit in a limited number of places, if any, on your bike), (3) they do offer 3-yr protection on your bike for an additional $15."
3,"Decent lock, mount breaks easily","This is a good, study lock for a decent price. The locking mechanism moves smoothly and seems to work well. The only down side is that the plastic bike mount breaks pretty easily. The main piece that attaches to the lock to the mount broke within a month."
2,Locking Mechanism Broke,"While the lock itself does what it is meant to do (keep my bike from being stolen), the locking mechanism has broken. I dropped the lock once and 1) the plastic casing around the locking mechanism cracked, 2) there is a visible gab between the metal locking section in the center of the lock (the part that is metal and not covered with plastic) and the body it is connected to, and 3) I really have to finagle the key to make it lock/unlock. Not exactly the best construction..."
2,Disappointed,"After only a few months of using it, I realized the plastic inside of the lock was cracked. I don't know why or how this happened, or if I was provided a defective product at the beginning. It still works as a lock, but the straight part of the lock falls into three pieces (literally) when it's not connected to the curved half, and it takes a bit of fiddling to put it back together so it can be used. Would not recommend."
5,A Must Have!!!,"This 10 cd collection at such a low price is a must have for lovers of early R&B, raw blues ,jump blues and roots of rock and roll.The sound quality is fine as you will hear obscure artists and tunes.This could be the best deal in music on Amazon .Juke Boy Bonners ""Runnin Shoes"" alone is worth the $20 price. There are almost no turkeys in the whole set.I do wish there was a booklet with some info on the artists.I cant add much that the other reviewers havent written so buy it and have the best 10 hours of listening ."
5,Fantastic collection,"This box set collects 10 discs worth of wonderful good time R&B. It has a freshness to the sound since very few if any of the songs actually charted. Leave it to Europeans to dig up treasures in American music! And at this price it's a no-brainer, pick it up!"
1,White Coats,"a. Especifications of the product I received from Amazon doesn't match that I received: Specifications in Amazon page indicate subtitles in spanish and english. The product I received only has specifications in English.I paid for the product more and less $ 14,99, a few days ago the product goes to $ 9,99Finally, doesnt pay to return the product due to the cost of the return.RegardsMauricio Rubaja"
1,1 star for the party scene,"One scene...Where the cute brunette nurse in red did her little performance... was interesting and only because she was cute and in red. The rest of this movie was just lousy. It wasn't funny (and I like low brow juvenile humor as much as anyone,) but there wasn't any. Couple bad acting with a terrible script and a resolution that was so painfully obvious early in the film, well... Don't bother. You could better spend your time going to any high school stage production and see better acting..guaranteed. I'm sure that years from now, cast members of this project will be investing in some liquid paper to white out their resumes if this mess is included among their credits."
1,"Old Story, Old Ideas, Old, Old, Old, and, Old...","If you can make it through the entire film, you're a real trooper and you'll only find one palatable funny part.[...]The cast is unfamiliar and not readily recognizable from other shows or movies in mainstream Hollywood. Dan Aykroid (I did that on purpose--it's not a typo), slightly elevates the quality of the film, but, if you need Dan Acridhemorrhoid to elevate your film, the film is seriously pathetic.The ONLY humorous part of the movie was when a young intern was forced to tell a family that their loved-one died on the operating table...BUT THIS GAG HAS BEEN DONE SO MANY TIMES IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE!!!!Other than that, it's one comedy cliché after another until this bowel obstruction finally ends.If you have a serious burning desire to buy this movie, then I wouldn't pay over the ""used"" price for this cinematic enema...Good luck..."
3,Like a R rated long but bad episode of Scrubs,"I saw that this film had Dan Aykroyd, Maury Chaykin & Saul Rubinek in it, and I thought- ""how can it lose?""Man, let me count the ways. True, those three do well in their parts, but those parts are very small (That's what she said!....drum riff) but otherwise it's just pretty bad, enlivened with a few grins and fun moments. In fact, my joke there is about the level of the humor.Mind you, if you're a fan of this cast or this type of comedy, and you can get a copy here on Amazon for cheap (I see some for 1 cent) - try it. If you aren't expecting much, you'll be OK."
2,Don't say I didn't warn you..,"I've worked in a hospital for the past 28 years and I enjoy a good medical show. I loved the TV show Scrubs and ER, too.There were a few funny moments in this (such as when they did the saliva swabs and looked at them under the microscope). Otherwise, this flick was not worth watching."
2,Slots too small,"Who wouldn't love anything Mario Batali? Well, evidently me. I purchased this spoon to replace my 10 yr-old stained pieces. I loved the fact this item was slotted - I envisioned it replacing my slotted plastic spatula too. However, after several uses, I wasn't happy with it's slots - the thin openings did not work for me. Great product - just not for me."
1,Big disappointment,"The fact that this was in the Wayside Gardens series mislead me. When the book arrived I discovered that it was written by a Britisher for the British gardener and that 3/4 of the plant material was not useable in the mid-Atlantic region.The pictures are sumptuous, but the content is just not relevant for the American gardener - unless, of course, you are on the Pacific Coast!"
4,Emergent Reader on Circles,Good for young children or emergent readers. ESOL kids will enjoy this method of learning reading and being introduce the concept of circle in English.
5,Insightful and revealing,"As a dancer, I definitely relate to the fact that memories are stored in our bodies and that movement can help us heal. Gabrielle reveals that American society promotes a false sense of self and that through movement, we can begin to put the pieces back together that will make us whole again."
4,Review from Theamwriter,"This is the second book in the Sons of the Dark series by Lynne Ewing. This is book is titled Escape. This book talks about another one of the Legend of Four, Samuel. He comes into the picture, and is tried to be persuaded by Ashley who promised to help him travel back in time to find his family. But the others urge him not to listen to Ashley. I loved reading the background story of Samuel and his family. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy reading book with supernatural abilities within the pages."
3,"Nice advice, but not enough.","It does have many good pieces of advice for the amateur songwriter, but I feel that it lacks the most basic element of a good book, to grab you, and MAKE you learn. Its not a total waste of money, but it could be better."
1,Piece of junk!,"Waste of money and time, piece of junk plain and simple. Weak clamp, does not stay tight. Donot even think about this clamp. Never again!"
1,Too Large,"Either I got a 7"" clamp sent to me in error instead of 6"" or this thing is too big and won't tighten enough. I used it on standard 6"" flex ducting and even at the max tightness it just lays limply on the connection rather than tightening.It's also fiddly to put together and keeps coming apart as you try to tighten it if you're not careful."
4,Satisfied,I had not been able to find this product. I had about come to the fact that I would need to construct a clamp for my project. I located the clamp by searching Amazon.com. It has proven to be totally satisfactory.
5,does the job,"why make me write more than I want to, this is a waste of my time and now is a waste of everyone's time to read???"
2,"Way, way too expensive for what you get.","This is all stainless, however the spikes are shorter than the other items available and you only get 5 linear feet for $26. That's $5/foot. You can buy the plastic ones or the ones with stainless spikes and plastic spine for a lot less."
3,I purchased this item for the wrong reason,"I purchased this item with the hopes of keeping squirrels away from my bird feeders. Well, it didn't work. Of course I was disapointed. The squirrels walked through the very sparce, wide apart spikes. Don't try it."
2,Just go to ESPN.com,The scouting reports for all the players can be found on ESPN.com for free. Don't waste your money on this.
3,Totally agree with the above reviewer.,"The stories were ""cute"", as when I was 15 reading the little 1"" thick harlequin romances. The characters themselves were likeable. (Trace w/Bridget was a really nice, sexy guy) but the stories fell short in many ways. There was no depth of either the story or the characters and that was a real shame. So much potential gone to waste. I also picked up inconsistencies as did the other reviewer but they didn't disturb me as much as the superficiality (hope that's a word) of the work itself."
3,Four Tangled Tales,"Not very many have found this book or at least not bothered to review it. I found the inconsistencies a fault too, plus Malcome's first wife was called Polly in one part of the book and he talked about her as Becky in the last one. I found the plot just too unbelievable. What kind of grandpappy was he anyway? He sure didn't parcel out those babies with any concern to their futures or their pasts. When two of the four were actually full sisters and the other two actually twins, why did he split them up by giving them to two different son's of his to raise? I found it all a bit much and then to have two of the girl's mom be right there under their noses was the crowning touch. You have to wonder how an author arrives at such twisted tales."
1,Maltitol is toxic,"These items contain a great deal of maltitol, which inflicts terrible side effects. I for one can't tolerate this product. The severity of the side effects is highly problematic."
3,"Tasty, but a bit too sweet and very flimsy when warm.","I decided to take a break from the organic chocolate tarts I've been enjoying and try the cinnamon danish. While they do taste pretty good, they are a bit too sweet for me (and I actually like sweet things, so that says a lot), and when put in a toaster, become almost impossible to get out of the toaster, because they lose their rigidity and basically fold over and become a bit of a mess. I'll try some other flavors, but that's it for me on the cinnamon."
3,Okay if you like this type of thing....,"I wanted to add a review since, while these aren't a bad product, I don't particularly care for them. There may be others who are helped by my description of the product.These are neither pastry-like or cookie-like. I would describe them as similar to a very thin, soft Fig Newton in consistency, and somewhat similar in flavor as well, except instead of ""fig"" these have quite a lot of cinnamon flavor (very good) and a nondescript ""creme"" filling (meh).While I appreciated the courageous use of lots of cinnamon in these, overall I find them far too sweet (and I like sweets) and lacking in appealing texture and flavor really otherwise.On the plus side, if you like these sorts of ""bar"" snacks, these are healthier versions than some."
5,Hard to find in stores,"This is my husband's favorite mid-morning snack. It is very hard to find in the local stores ... but when we've found it, the price ranges from $3.79 per box and higher. It wonderful to be able to buy this in bulk (we usually get 2 orders of the 6 packs of 6) and also get free shipping, so it is less expensive. It was delivered in less than a week."
4,Good,"While the compilation album ""Standing on the Beach"" is a better overall collection of singles, this is the Cure's first batch in original form. Some good stuff here, from the title track to ""Killing an Arab"" (widely misinterpreted) to ""Jumping Someone Else's Train."""
3,The Cure kept it simple for their debut,"The Cure were a 3 piece band when they recorded this album and it showed. If you listen to this album then put in ""17 seconds"" you would think that they were a different band. I'm not knocking this CD, it's just VERY different than any of the others they put out. I adore ""Plastic Passion"". The Cure is one of my favorite bands but that doesn't mean I'm gonna hand out 5 star ratings because of that. I'm just trying to give the reader an honest voice"
5,Classic album..........,"Nonetheless, I seem to remember this album containing a great track entitled ""World War"" and ""So What"" was missing..... At least from the album I had decades ago..... Though it is quite possible I'm losing my mind in my old age, as well.... Though I would rather have ""World War"" here over ""So What"", this record is obviously a ""must have"" for any new or casual Cure fans who do not already own it."
3,Boys Don't Cry,"I can't tell you what it is about this album that is so great, because first off, there are some horrible songs on here. I've grown tolerant (if not loving) of some of the tracks I didn't like at first (Accuracy, Fire In Cairo). However, I don't think I'll ever be able to stop myself from skipping past the likes of So What, Subway Song, and Grinding Hault. So why would I keep an album that has 3 of 12 songs I have to skip and 2 of 12 that I had to grow to like? Because for every bad song on this album there are 2 great songs. It's so mind-numbingly poppy how can you not love every minute of it? I started off with Cure albums like Faith, Disintegration, and Pornography and I think it's safe to say that I was initially quite put off by this album. Over time it gnaws away at your ears until your brain snaps and you start dancing like no white man should. Anyway, It's not bad but I wouldn't seek it out unless you're a Cure completest."
4,it's my favorite by the cure,"i just got into the cure, but i find alot of the stuff they did in the 80's and 90's boring. this album i think is the best i've heard by them. i guess the more technical stuff bores me. don't get me wrong, they have done songs after this that i have liked, but this is really the only album i can sit through entirely."
2,bad,"This is the tasteless debut by British band THE CURE. The tittle track is very good, there other two or three good songs, the rest will make you fall asleep."
2,Weak debut,"The title track is very good. The badn was only a trio here, and releases a very simples set of songs, that don't take you by the ba.. It's good but boring."
4,I wish every senior manager would read this book.,"While I think the title ""Fourth Generation Management"" overstates its impact, I wish every senior manager in corporate America would read this book. Many of today's larger corporations are filled with managers so busy fighting for their own promotion (or survival) that their decisions and actions fail to move the organization towards its goals. Adding to the problem is a general laziness in the thought processes displayed by many career-minded individuals. Further compounding the problem is the mindless tampering that always seems to backfire, resulting in increased costs and waste. In this very readable book, Brian Joiner provides solid explanations for these phenomena and offers insight into how to address these issues. As a management consultant, I often recommend this book to my clients. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me - adamleft@webspan.net."
4,Pretty Good,"The Goo Goo Dolls deliver again as usual. This is a great album, but it's pretty light sounding, if not boring. The previous albums all had a great mix of soft and loud songs, but this album is mainly soft. The element this album is missing is Robby's songs. They only put two on the cd, and his songs have always put a lot of energy into their albums, but that is clearly missing here. I actually prefer a lot of Robby's songs over John's, so that's why I'm only giving this 4 stars. Plus the song Give A Little Bit isn't even theirs, its a remake of some older song, I don't know who sang it though.Overall though its a great cd. The best songs are Stay With You, Let Love In, Listen, Can't Let It Go and Strange Love."
5,Fantastic Music,I absolutly loved the new cd. I haven't stoped listening to it since I bought it. I have throughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone. It has definitely been worth the wait.
4,Let Love In,"My favorite Goo album is A Boy Named Goo... I love Long Way Down and Naked. The only Goo album I don't own is their very first release... that being said...Let Love In is almost as good as A Boy Named Goo. I think the song Feel the Silence is the best song recorded by Goo, and the lyrics are pretty good too. I think this album shows you that the Goo Goo Dolls now know who they are, but I also think the ballads were chosen because they have been told that is what sells. I do agree, Johnny's voice should not be wasted, but while I absolutely love this cd, it is not one you can listen to over and over or it will put you to sleep, it's not quite up beat enough.Great Songs:Let Love InFeel the SilenceBecomeStay With YouOk Songs:Better Days (Overplayed right now)Without You HereThe rest I wasn't too crazy about"
3,Mediocre,"I am glad to see that the Goo Goo Dolls finally put out a new album. They definitely have an ""above average"" talent, but you wouldn't know it by listening to Let love in. While ""Better days"" is one of the best songs I have heard from them, one song can't make an album. It is a cd worth picking up if you're a Goo fan, but not something I would call an essential."
3,its just not rock.,"I have been a goo fan for a few years now. I bought gutterflower when it came out and liked that so much I bought Dizzy, carwash, a boy, and hold me. I got this album yesterday and have listened to the songs and I just dont feel it. on Dizzy and superstar carwash and a boy named goo thy dolls had something they really really put something into it. That thing that passion just isnt there for this album im afraid. Not only that as the albums have gone on the Dolls have become less and less rock. If anyone knows their dolls history they started as a punk band and if you listen to there older albums its just hard rifs and screaming. but when I listen to this it is so soft and melodic i just dont get it. Maybe time has taken some of their edge off but I think if they get any softer we are gonna have to rank them as blues musicians. which isnt bad but its not why I like the dolls."
5,Thank God They Changed Their Sound,"ohhh... the Goo Goo Dolls, they have long be hard for me to understand. I have liked many of their songs in the past (iris and name come to mind) but their albums have never been that great. Every single these guys release however, has been fantastic. Which leads me to ""Let Love In"". Every song on this album sounds like the good Goo Goo Dolls. I for one am gratful that they have finally embraced the sound that has made the rich.Now I know that I gave this cd a 5 but I still had some complaints. Robbie Takac also sings two of the songs on this album... not good. I think this man needs to stick to playing the guitar.This album is a must buy if you have liked any of the singles off of it."
4,"Goo Goo Dolls : ""Let Love In""","Much better than ""Gutter Flower"" in terms of just about everything. These aree the Goo Goo Dolls that I came to know and love listening to, and they've done a fine job of getting back to the basics. ""Let Love In"" may not be as ground breaking as ""Dizzy Up The Girl"", but it's pretty close. I was hoping that the Goo Goo Dolls would get back to what made them great, and I think they've come very close to accomplishing that here....A great release all around. If you like anything the Goo Goo Dolls put their stamp on, you should enjoy ""Let Love In"" as well. Not a masterpiece, but a very good listen all around.Great job guys!!!!"
2,Four years and this is the best they can do?,"Where to start? The length has been mentioned by other reviewers... only nine truly new songs.The album isn't awful or painful to listen to, but it's so boring. The majority of it sounds extremely similar, and almost none of the songs are memorable. ""Better Days"" is a fairly good song, as is the cover ""Give A Little Bit"", but the rest is just... dull. It all sounds like filler material, or B-sides. It's sad... I usually dread Robby's songs, but his ""Listen"" is one of the higher points on the album, mostly because it's a break from the repetitive sound of John's songs.Four years, and the Goo Goo Dolls couldn't put out something better than this? Superstar Car Wash, A Boy Named Goo, and Dizzy Up The Girl were all amazing albums, with catchy, memorable songs, and variety. Gutterflower, while not up to the level of the previous three, had several great songs and was still worth listening to. This album just isn't."
1,Let love in = let boredom in,"I cannot agree more with the few reviewers who gave this lame album one star. Unfortunately, I paid for this, and knew once I saw Glen Ballard had produced the album that it would probably suck. Sure enough, it does. More acoustic based, mid-tempo crap - in fact other than the opening track, the whole album is a snoozer!! I remember when these guys actually used to rock (see Hold Me Up, or Superstar Car Wash). At least Dizzy Up the Girl, and Gutterflower had at least a couple rockers. Let Love Rule has none. This is the last release I will ever buy of these guys. They should change their name to the Goo Goo Dulls!"
2,The GGDs - Good God its Dreary!!! I didnt like it...,"Well downunder here in Sydney Australia, the sounds from this proprock group sounds vastly similar to what we have appearing on Australian Idol (same as American Idol!) reality TV. If only these people were to wake up and realise that they are not doing their voices any justice by recording them! They would be better off keeping their lips sealed. The music is bland, the voices of the two fellows is a strain on the ears (I have since developed tinnitus in my left drum). Even Kylie Minogue produces a better album - and she cant even sing!! Dont buy it save your hard earned money or give it to a busker in the subway! The album cover is superb!"
1,"Definition of the word ""Sellout""","This album blows! This band blows now! How does a great band like this end up doing these types of albums? Last great album is Superstar Carwash. I would hate to love money as much as these guys obviously do! Can you believe they cover a supertramp song? They are not in a ""tough position"" as another reviewer states,they simply want to write songs for soccer moms now. They make a sh*tload of money doing what they do now,fine.It is called selling out nothing else!"
1,goo goo Pleasant,Music is good and follows too long after the last cd. Handling the sale and dealing with payments caused me and several others so much grief and hassel that you should pay more and buy this music at a real store with customer service and people you can talk to. this staff is non existant and totally unhelpful. Pay double and you will still get a better deal and support doing business in a friendly way.
1,Disappointed,"I felt compelled to add my voice to disillusioned Goo Goo Dolls fans who have watched a gradual decline from the explosive, innovative rock we once enjoyed. No previous GGD CD has been so lacking in intensity. Languid, mournful numbers from the talented Rzeznik are barely passable, a shadow of the greatness evidenced on previous CDs. The chord progressions are anything but inventive. I actually found myself enjoying Robbie Takac's raspy ""Listen""--if only because it sticks to what Goo Goo Dolls have always done best: Bright Rock.I hate myself for feeling this way. I really wanted to love this album, but the lack of depth and the triteness of the lyrics force me to cast a vote of disapproval. I'm willing to wait another 4 years, if somehow the next album can recapture the emotion and vibrance of Boy Named Goo and Dizzy Up the Girl."
1,Poor effort,"First let me say that I am a long-time Goo Goo Dolls fan, however, this is their weakest effort yet. Lyrically, it's not bad but I'm afraid the melodies all sound the same. Glen Ballard has not added any value that I can find to the production. Additionally, while Rzeznik is certainly not the strongest vocalist in the world I find his vocals on this CD to be positively lackluster. I really have to wonder if he still has passion for music anymore. I'll continue to listen to past releases and hope for a stronger release next time around."
5,If you LOVE the GOOs this one's for you,"Any TRUE Goo Goo Dolls fan will not find fault.The ""Let Love in"" track is totally amazing and ROCKS in every way! This musically sensuous song is destined for NUMBER 1 ......... I wish I could be so talented. LOVE it LOVE it LOVE it... THE WHOLE DISC IS A KEEPER. It's like a mind massage to me, relaxing and stimulating at the same time. Put it on and do your chores, forget your troubles - Works for me!"
3,Should have been better,"I have two other Goo Goo Dolls CDs - Dizzy Up The Girl and Gutterflower - and I don't think Let Love In measures up to those. It is pleasant soft rock, and if you have enjoyed their music like I have, I'd take a listen and decide for yourself whether or not to buy. I think the best songs are ""Stay With You,"" ""Better Days,"" ""Give A Little Bit,"" and ""Can't Let It Go."" Three of those are somewhat upbeat. ""Listen"" is one of Robbie's strongest and is also good. But to me, nothing matches the punch of a song like ""January Friend"" from Dizzy Up The Girl or the creativity of ""Truth Is A Whisper"" from Gutterflower. They're better off with their signature power pop - here they seem to fit in too much."
3,"Too Mellow, Boring","I love the Goo Goo Dolls, I have driven hours to see them. But I am really disappointed in this CD. I only like five songs on the Cd, and one (Give a Little Bit) has already been released. The Cd is too mellow and boring for my taste. Not nearly enough Rock & Roll. I love the GGD ballads, but not a whole Cd of them."
1,What happened to the Goo Goo Dolls?,"This cd sucks! I recommend you to not waste your money buying it. I've been a Goo Goo Dolls fan for years and years. I own every album...been lucky to meet them backstage...get my picture taken with them...the whole nine yards. This album truely disappoints me. Are the Goo Goo Dolls getting ""tired"" or are they just making music to suit the radio people? I hang my head in shame for this album...all the songs sound the same and do not impress me whatsoever."
2,Goo Goo Dolls RIP,"I bought this album knowing that it was going to be a cheesy, insipid adult contemporary slop album filled with forgettable ballads. The only reason I bought it is because I wanted to support John, Robby, and Mike. Alas, this is going to be my last Goo album since this once beloved band of mine has proven beyond a doubt that they have been mentally and creatively castrated due to their desire to peddle more money by appealing to the American Top 40 audience.It was great while it lasted but all good bands come to an end when seeing green becomes more important than pleasing their diehard fans and continuously pushing themselves creatively.I recommend buying some of the Goos older albums Hold Me Up, Superstar Carwash, A Boy Named Goo, and All I learned about Ego, Opinion, Art, and Commerce. Dizzy Up the Girl is a pretty good album but it was an insidious sign of the impeding artistic demise of the Buffalo rockers."
1,Never delivered,"I patiently awaited this CD for over 3 1/2 weeks. When I finally got a inqury from Amazon, I emailed the vendor immediately. He was supposed to refund my money and I still haven't seen it. Bad customer service."
4,Good listening....,"I think this is the second best album by Goo Goo Dolls. Sure it doesn't have the most popular songs you hear over and over on the radio. But the songs on here are well writen, sung well and are not ""worn out"" from over air play.Don't get me wrong, I love to hear old favorites. But this new stuff is really good, and deserves to be heard.The three best ones on here(in my humble opinion)are;""Let Love In""""Give a Little Bit""""Can't Let it Go"" ~The best! : )I like ""Can't Let it Go"", because it is very strong in beat(particularly in the way the guitar is strummed)and has a catchy choirs from Johnny. This song struck me as being rather different from all other Goo Goo Dolls songs, but that is just me.Anyway, if you like Goo Goo Dolls I say; You need this album!And if you are not familiar with, and/or only know ""Slide"", ""Black Baloon"", "" Broadway"" and ""Iris""; You need this album too!"
2,sharp but fragile,Blade is sharp but very fragile and brittle. Fell off counter two weeks in and tip broke off and blade bent. Never had that happen with any other knife. Expensive lesson learned
5,My Favorite Knife,"Out of all the kitchen knives such as chef's, santoku, paring, etc. this is my favorite knife that I have had the pleasure of using. The slight angle takes a little getting used to, but I now find it preferable to the standard design of most knives. The Shun Steel Utility Knife is a single, solid piece of high quality and durable steel. It has a sleek and smooth look that is very appealing. The knife cuts clean and precise for a variety of different uses. The fact that it was designed by Alton Brown, and has a lifetime warranty both hold some signficant weight and value. I would highly recommend this product to others, and if I ever lost mine I would purchase another one."
3,Shunned,"I have come to appreciate the quality, design, and very much respect the sharpness of Shun knives. New in box (so not some knockoff) the Alton's angled knife is a chef's dream, and the 6"" size is very useful size, not too big or small, just right.What disappointed was the blade manufacture. It's lopsided in the way it went through the sharpening process. About a 3 mm polished and sharpened surface on left side of knife, and about a 5 mm sharpened and polished on the right side. Does not affect use, but these knives are known for their beauty as well as their function.As sharp and high quality as these knives are, I also think they could easily modify the shipping plastic to become the knife's protective case once it gets to the destination kitchen; instead, I have no choice but to recycle this form-fitting plastic and wish people thought more about the planet and knife drawer."
2,sharp but WEAK,"The 10 degree angle to the handle and the incredibly sharp blade make for great slicing. However, within a week of use, the blade got a chip in it and started to rust around the damage. We never dropped it but did put it in the sink with other dishes to hand wash. So be warned this knife is incredibly fragile. If you treat your knives like delicate artwork, this knife is for you. If you expect your knife to be a tool that holds up to mild use, stay away."
2,"Disappointing ""classic"" punk album","After years of hearing how great and aggressive this particular ""classic"" punk rock album was, I plunked down 20 bucks and bought the thing. All I can say is while the band's heart is in the right place (nice lads trying to approximate an Aussie Iggy and the Stooges/Doors hybrid), their music doesn't quite cut the mustard. The playing is speedy enough, but it lacks the pure, nasty crunch of classic Ig. In fact, it's a little too cleanly played (like college kids trying to ape Robert Johnson on expensive guitars). ""Radios Appear"" isn't bad, but there's not anything here that hasn't been done better elsewhere (i.e. Pink Fairies). For true Aussie raunch and roll, check out Rose Tattoo's ""Assault and Battery"" or the Saints' ""(I'm) Stranded"" and bypass this sincere, but toothless effort."
2,Gory horror,"It's really my fault that I haven't done more research before deciding to read this book right after the Book of Lost Things. They are very different. The Book of Lost Things is a gentle, dark yet hopeful and touching retelling of old fairytales interposed onto a boy's life. Nocturnes is a series of gory, gutty, gritty horror tales. It may be your thing but it definitely isn't mine. I confess I didn't finish the book but the first three stories turned me off completely. The Cancer Cowboy Rides seemed an attempt at copying works by H.G. Wells and Stephen King. Cancer is a horrible thing and I don't need a story to horrify me about it even further without a positive redemption."
4,"Purple Cover, Purple Prose","John Connolly'sNocturnesis a collection of short stories in the horror genre. Some are chilling enough in just a few pages to get one's pulse racing, while others are more subtle in their creeps. Connolly is a gifted writer, though he tends toward purple prose which, at least in my case, became distracting at times. Still, an all around good read, with some shining stars."
2,Skip this and buy a Lovecraft short story collection,"I picked this one up on the $3.99 table at Borders. It's not the worst where writing is concerned, but the plots are predictable and overall about as chilling as DC in September. The author seems to rely on the ick-factor that comes with using children in these sorts of stories, instead of crafting anything truly macabre. If you're into this sort of fiction you would do well to pick up some H.P. Lovecraft, who was a master of this genre."
3,Middle of the road read,"I read this after seriously enjoying the book of lost things (fab book). Some of the short stories were fairly disappointing and i found myself counting the amount of pages left. Also the twists at the end of them could have been a little better plotted. It seemed to me the author almost got bored writing them and just wanted to finish.In saying that, there are some interesting stories and the novella in the middle kept me entertained. Also the stories are short so you can pick the book up and down and not have to invest too much time.Okay read but thought would be more spine-tingling."
3,It's okay,"I'm a big fan of Connolly's Parker books, but didn't find myself as involved with the stoories contained here. They reminded me of fiction from t he 50s and while in the fifties I enjoyed the style it doesn't quite read the same today; I would say however try it yourself and see what you think."
4,Great writing,"I'm a fan, but also a confirmed talking book listener, and I couldn't find this recorded anywhere. So I bought it for my Kindle and took a chance on the text-to-voice feature. Not bad.Incidently, the stories are excellent."
4,A great read,"It has been a while since I read a book that drew me into it the way ""Nocturnes' did. Full of short stories, each could be expanded into a book length, but John Connolly made the wise decision to keep them short and thorough enough to deliver the final blow at the end at the right time.I liked all of the stories, but my favorite is ""The Wakeford Abyss."" I think the despair at the end of the story - so vaguely described yet stated clearly -- did it for me.I totally recommend this book for someone who's into elegant horror."
2,Not very good,"This volume was a disappointment. His novels are far better. The most successful pieces are pastiche of Stephen King and in these cases he manages to produce something which is pretty much as good as the original - given that King's output is uneven to say the least. However, his attempts to cover the great English ghost story writers like MR James are not up to scratch. He is far more comfortable with Americana than with the world of repressed Oxbridge dons being plagued by strange visions while on brass-rubbing holidays in East Anglia. I don't have the book handy, but in one of the stories a tomb is found with an early date on it - something like 976 AD. Anyone with even a basic knowledge of these matters would realise that AD time wasn't widely used until centuries later - I feel the ghost of MR James tutting loudly from beyond the grave."
5,attaches well to shopvac hose,I used it to make a poor-mans dust collection for a table saw. closed off the bottom of saw with press board and installed this dust port. No more saw dust!
3,Odd Weight,"This pencil draws a great line, but I wish the barrel was metal and not plastic. It's not very unbalanced, but it just feels wrong in the hand. Overall, it's not bad (thus the three star review), but I will be returning it."
5,Pentel Graph Gear 500,"Great pencil, works fantastic. Very happy with purchase. A bit small for a man's hand but works very well...The lead feeds well, the grip is good, a little small."
3,falls apart,"I was able to use this for about 2 months before it totally fell apart on me. Lead breaks very very easily, and it's just mechanically not all together. Try a Forte Pro .3mm."
4,"Pentel GraphGear 500, 0.7 mm review","I really enjoy using this Pentel GraphGear 500 Pencil (0.7mm) during all of my drawing and layout needs. Between working during the day as an Engineer and woodworking & metalworking in the evenings, I'm always drawing or laying out something. This pencil in the 0.7 mm size has a great feel in the fingers, smooth lead advancement and very nicely balanced. I love that the tip is metal and not the cheap plastic that seems to break at the wrong time. I have owned at least 8 of these pencils (5 of them have some how walked away from my desk) and I recommend these to all my friends that do technical drawings or want great layout lines."
5,Had one for twenty years,"Excellent pencil I'm In a planning and drafting department at ingalls shipbuilding, I've used this type pencil for twenty years, well this is a newer version, of what I have used, almost necessary for my line of work, excellent for small details when drawing, got 3 for my kids to use at school, actually have box of em"
5,Excellent and easy to prepare mixes for dinner or baking!,"I loved this book! It has truly simplified my life. I have made almost every mix. I especially love the meat mixes. I am an extremely busy person and this has prevented alot of the traditional take-out pizza! I now cook once a month and dinner is just a matter of a couple of minutes and a few ingrediants. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who wants to save money, time and increase the variety to nightly dinners!"
5,Greatest Cookbook,"I first purchased these Make a Mix book back in the 70's. They were great for putting good meals on the table for a family of six. Great Saving to! I wore them out and lent them out until I didn't get it back. I have looked and looked for another copy. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
3,A bit below par with two or three eagles,"Having had few or no complaints about BBVD's self-titled album and This Beautiful Life, I eagerly picked this disc up. Perhaps it's a case of expectations placed too highly, but this album falls well short of those two albums, but does manage a few songs I'd hope will be hits.Among these hits, the title track is by far my favorite. Its got a very intriguing darkness to it that I like. Other highlights include You Know You Wrong, Oh Yeah, and I Like It. Meanwhile there's songs like Zig Zaggity Woop Woop which are a big let down. I guess this two part song is supposed to open the way for the rest of the album and then close it out with a flourish, but it left me wanting to burn this CD without those two songs. I also really wanted to like Don't You Feel My Leg for its blues sultriness, but something didn't come up right there for me.All told, this album is a bit below the par for the course that BBVD usually swings."
2,Two for Too Slow,"The musical ability is still here in this album, and there's really nothing wrong with any of the songs. It's just that they all seem much too slow. I actually like to dance to my swing music, and this CD just doesn't have enough energetic fast songs to be much fun dance-wise. I'm also not too keen on the strong Southern blues influence. This is all just personal preference. The music itself is quite skillful, but stick to their first album if you really want to be inspired to get onto the floor."
3,Good..but not RCR good,"The reviewer only has it 1/2 right. BBVD did have a big hit with You and Me and the Bttle Makes 3...and yes that was from Swingers...HOWEVER...Royal Crown Revue is the superior band both musically and vocally. Point of interest..the directors of Swingers went to RCR first to perform in the movie...but due to schedueling issues they could not be in it (Big Bad Voodoo Daddy was a second choice...a fill in!) RCR was the band in The Mask (for those who don't know.) At any rate...This CD is good...better then the second one...not as good as the first...Buy it if you like these guys. If your a late comer to the ""new-age swing"" movement check out Royal Crown Revue first."
2,Uninspired Retread of Americana Deluxe,"I like many had high hopes for BBVD's third mass release, surely this one could not be as bad as their last release? Well...This album will be unable to save BBVD's souls. The lyrics are completely uninspired and the melodies are clearly retreaded from their first Coolsville release. It's sad - really!!The only way to save BBVD is for Scotty Morris to stop producing the albums. Let a professional produce the songs, Scotty should spend his time rethinking his lyric writing and coming up with some better bridges for his songs."
1,"Boring New Orleans funk and shallow pop, with horns...","This is very annynamous sounding music, which actually sounds more liek an ametuer marching high school band. The music is very repetitive, whcih is what funk music is all about. It is nowhere near as entertaining as thier last two releases which are very good. This is the last BBVD cd I'll ever buy, and it's a throwaway! Skip this one unless you actually liked Harry Connick Jr.,'s funk New Orleans cd's like She. Or if you like repetitive rhythms and high school marching bands, but if you are looking for hot New Orleans jazz or swing, look elsewhere or buy thier other cd's! This is very funky and boring, no creativity or artistic qualities are found here."
3,Decent,"While Andrew Marvell, was an influential poet in the 17th Century and while his poetry and prose is still a testament to the English language, this collection lacks the emphasis on his excellent shorter poems that use brilliant and sharp language and instead focuses on his lengthy plays that are dry and convoluted. Maybe another version would be better, check his poetry online to decide which volume to buy."
1,POS,"I've had nothing but trouble with this unit. If you run out of ink of any color you can no longer print. This means if you run out of yellow you can no longer print even black and white documents or in grayscale. I've had my printer tell me numerous times that there is no cartridge even though I had just replaced it, which also prevents printing. You just have to take it out and reinsert it until it finally decides to accept your ink.After only about a month of use it sounds like a freight train filled with forks and chalkboards screeching to a halt every time a piece of paper passes through it."
2,Nothing more than a chapter from Lonely Planet Egypt,"Just returned from Egypt. Took the Lonely Planet Egypt and Cairo. Every word in this book is in the Egypt text, which is far more thorough and informative. Don't waste your money on this older book when the newest Egypt has all of this plus the rest of country updated."
3,Worst One,I think that the other 3 (soon 4) seventh tower books were better. I have a group of 4 friends including me and we all think the order goes Fall Above the Veil Aenir Castle
3,cliff hanger ending,When I started this book I didn't know it was a long term series.I see now that it is up to at least 6 books.The writing is good and the story excitingas sword and sorcery type fantasies go.The young hero Tal ( a city deweller ) is paired with Milla ( an ice viking):in a lot of ways this plot is a take off on the Alan Dean Fosterseries:Icerigger: (#1)andMissions to Moulokin: (#2).For me the Foster books are better because they have a sci fi background/ space opera to them.The cliff hanger ending so jerked me aroundthat I doubt I would buy the next one in the sequence.Sci Fi and fantasy have gotten so mixed these days thatit is hard to tell a dragon from an ice monster...
4,A good read,"This second installment of The Seventh Tower is not as strong as the first, but it is by all means a good book. The beginning is slow and the plot could have seen a little more action, though there were many interesting points, such as the sinister Hall of Nightmares, the pit where Tal finds clues as to what happened to his father and in the last few pages the enterance to the heavily mentioned and finally revealed world of Aenir, where the story leaves another abrupt, though suspenseful ending.Overall it is a good bit of fantasy."
4,Great,"This book was perfect, exept for a couple of mistakes, For example, in the first book it said that merwin horns stopped glowing when they were dead, but in this book Milla's merwin horn sword glows."
5,A fantastic movie of the '80s,"The movie is great, enough said. The reason it is not on DVD is because of problems with the rights to the soundtrack. There is a lot of material on it belonging to Ed Van Halen and he has been unwilling to allow the rights to transfer to DVD. If you are a fan of Van Halen, speak up."
3,Worth seeing just to hear Eddie Van Halen,"Movie was good 80's fare, not too bad on that scale. Anyone who loves Eddie Van Halen MUST watch, because there is lesser-known music here that he wrote and played. Pay special attention to ""Donut City"" and the end-credit music."
3,"See this movie for two reasons: Kitten Natividad's ""assets"".","A film forgotten amongst the pile of teen 80's fair, I thought this film notable for the big screen performance by one of classic strip-tease's most well-endowed performers. Hey, it wouldn't be an indulgent 'Ridgement High' style flick without a little skin, and Natividad certainly has the merchandise to sell even this script. Or maybe I am being too harsh? To be sure, this film sports some stars, like Stoltz and Quaid, and there are some funny moments. I admit that when I was an 80's teen and saw this movie, I sometimes identified, especially with the 'Nam-fixated younger brother. But as an adult, I seem to have lost my taste for such sophomoric hijinx. Really, this kind of film was done better. If you're gonna see it, see it for the strip club scene. That's about all I remember it for after all these years anyway."
3,Oldie but Goodie,"Of course, the movie itself is funny. Having it on VHS isn't the best of quality these days so if you could find it on DVD it would be best. Great movie of the 80's!"
3,andy,I read the reviews from other clients and they said it was ecxellent. I dont doubt it but it was too slow and jazzy for someone who is accustomed to hearing the Police speed.
4,Nice album,"There isn't anything particularly phenomenal or adventurous about this album. However, it is quite good for pop music, and gives Summers a chance to show of his amazing fluency with ""neutral"" chords. Fans of the Police will recognize in this album a certain textural, minimalist philosophy that has been a hallmark of his since early on (no doubt greatly influenced by his work with Robert Fripp, e.g. ""I Advance Masked""). While not the greatest singer, Summers' voice has an honest, real quality that is actually quite endearing.As to the reviewer who states that the album could have been better had it not been for Summmers lack of enrolling a plethora of other musicians to contribute their instrumental skills because of his ego, this reviewer has completely missed the mark. The reason for some of the electronic accompaniment and so forth is was purely economical.And Andy Summers is truly one of the most humble, self-effacing musicians I have ever had the pleasure to meet."
3,A Mainstream Record by Andy Summers,"This is the one Andy Summers record that I have heard that it is not jazz. It is a fairly strong mainstream record, probably what we might have expected as a first endeavor after the Police.While the record sounds great, Andy doesn't stretch himself vocally. He stays in a very limited range, which, I think, limits the attractiveness and effectiveness of this endeavor. His voice is not unpleasant and the listener is left with the impression that he could have created a much stronger recording by taking more chances."
4,Excellent Light Fixture at a Good Price,"I used several of these light fixtures in the basement. They are well built, easy to install, and look nice -- without the flickering that some florescent fixtures have. They are also a good value. I had looked at both Lowes and Home Depot before finding these on Amazon.They do take some fumbling to get the bulbs inserted over the lip that holds the light diffuser in place. Also, to try to prevent damage in shipping, Amazon ships the fixture in a huge box, so you have a lot of packing to deal with.The units arrived mostly in good shape; some did have a few minor bends in the sheet metal that were easily straightened (and will be hidden by the light diffuser) and some of the light diffusers had chips out of the ends, but none of the fixtures had any major damage -- just be aware that they probably won't arrive in perfect condition."
3,Good basic glove...,"These are similar to all those gloves you see in the big box stores for $1.98...EXCEPT the cuffs are very thin and the lining tends to shred quickly. They also tend to run a bit smaller than advertised size. If you have average size hands, they are fine. But if you have large paws (like me) they are tight."
1,Ridiculous Gloves.,"Absolutely do not buy these gloves. At least not from Rogers Goods.Not 1 hour after i started using the gloves to rake the leaves off of my driveway the stitching on the back of 3 fingers, 2 on one glove and 1 on the other, that connect the fabric to the leather have completely fallen out. The gloves are no longer stitched together so its pointless even trying to use them again.The gloves also give off a horrible musty odor like they have been sitting around for 10 years.Keep in mind the stitching is on the back of the gloves, like where nothing would usually be rubbing on them, seems like a good design but these basically fell apart in my hands."
5,Great glove's for the money.,I've bought many glove's like these over the year's.These are a little heavier then I thought they would be. Really worth the money.
4,review,"good solid gloves looked at them but, have not used them yet trying to get some more words to submit"
5,Nice long-sleeve shirt,"I decided to order this, alongside a snapback for my birthday, and I have to say it looks really well. It is comfortable, and the printings are well done."
5,Nice shirt,Got this as a Christmas present for my nephew and it is perfect. He will love it. It is hard to find Steelers appareal in the Midwest so having amazon to rely on is great. Shipped very fast!
3,Runs small,This product runs a little small all over. It's a little bit short in length and a little less than roomy.
3,Gail rides her Welsh pony Candy into another time,"Gail is exploring the land around her parents' new house when she encounters Hilary and the beautiful estate Babylon. Only slowly does Gail begin to realize that her new friend - and the lovely world of the estate - are not of this time, that she and her pony are traveling between the modern era and the Victorian world of sidesaddles and horse-drawn carriages. And that either she or Hilary is a ghost."
2,Can I Get There By Candlelight,The condition of the book was listed as good. I would rate it as acceptable only. Book is musty smelling also didn't know it was a paperback book. Disappointed and way over priced.
5,Still a favorite...,"I read this book when I was about 11 years old. I'm 33 now and still remember it. It's one of the few books from my youth that I'll pick up and re-read every now and again. This book is the first one that introduced me to fantasy. But it's also mystery, supernatural, and historical as well as a great horse story. When I think of the top ten books that influenced me to become a writer, this is one of them that always comes to mind. I really think they should do a reprint. If you can find it, I highly recommend it for horse crazy girls aged 8-14, but it's still a nice story regardless of age."
4,candlelight,i read this book when i was about 8 years old.i loved it immediatel and read it again.then i forgot all about it.i recently became obsessed with finding it again.i finally did and now i realize how wonderful it is.this book has a melancholy tone and is actually kind of creepy.strange eerily suspenseful and one of my favorite books.i strongly recomend this book to everyone.
4,Maybe trying a bit too hard to be hip and relevant,"Very good book on civics topics and three founding documents of the American nation: the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution, and the Bill of RIghts.The book includes a glossary, a timeline, and a good index.Presents the Intolerable Acts, gives a VERY brief account of the Articles of Confederation, and includes great illustrations and cute text boxes.I sincerely wish this book included the TEXTs of the Declaration, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. The book does show some drafts, but does not have the texts for your kids to read.Presents colonial public opinion as monolithic and unified for declaring independence -- that is not factual."
1,Not a Good Choice,"This import is merely a poor duplicate of the Carpenters' original ""Horizon"" album from 1975. The sound quality is quite poor, and includes pops and clicks as if from vinyl. The group's 1975 release is a good choice if you are a Carpenters fan, but definitely purchase the A&M release of ""Horizon"". It is digitally remastered and has a full, clean sound. You won't regret it."
2,puny,saw blade is sharp but not rigid enough to hold up when being pushed back through a sap sticky branch. The slide mechanism is poorly designed and takes a concentrated effort to deploy and keep in place. It was cheap and has come in handy as a spare to toss in the bottom of the tool box or first aid back pack.
5,Good compact saw,"I had bought this Saw thinking that i just wasted some money, but I have used it at camp and around the house. It has been a very good piece of hardware. The blade rips through small 2-3 inch wide limbs at camp. When I was trimming the trees this spring it was like a hot knife through butter. I have no problems locking the blade in place and it stays there, never unlocking. I highly recommend this saw to anyone who wants a small lightweight saw in their camping pack or for some simple trimming around the house."
3,Great saw until it breaks,"I chose this saw because it is compact and lightweight. I've always had good luck with Gerber products as well. This saw cut very well on my first backpacking trip, no issues at all. I was quite impressed. A few weeks later I headed out again and after making three cuts the blade snapped. Spent the rest of the evening gathering small deadfall to burn... it was a chilly night.The price of this saw isn't worth sending it to Gerber for a replacement. I'm thinking about buying another because it truly worked well, but I need something that I can use more than once before it breaks."
1,Broke the first time I used it,"The I saw I got broke the first time I used it, very disappointing for sure. I was cutting a small branch about 1.5 inches thick and right at the end of the cut the blade bound and snapped right at the base by the handle. I wasn't even pushing that hard. Maybe I got a bad one, who knows, but I sure won't be buying another one."
3,It's ok,Overall it's a great product. However - the top curves inward and pushes against the shoulders. Product may not work well for someone with wide shoulders. The lumbar support is great though.
3,Pretty nice backrest,"I purchased this product to support my lower back in the chair that I use at my computer. It is supportive and I like the way it is shaped. However, the pump that is supposed to inflate the lower back area doesn't work very easily. I have a hard time pumping it up with my thumb and forefingers like the instructions say. And once it's pumped up, it seems slightly uneven. I do like the curvature that hugs my sides. All in all, I give it three stars."
3,BOUGHT FOR CAR,"I bought this to try and make the seat in my Mini Cooper tolerable and to add lumber support. It is too thick, and places me too far forward in the seat. It may work well in an office chair, though."
1,Accidental Finger Mutilation Waiting to Happen,"I bought this sharpener about a year ago- as far as sharpeners go, I figured I'd invest a little more to get a product that would last through two kids at least a few years in gradeschool- we've been through 2 or 3 $5 battery sharpeners over the past 4 or 5 years.(it's usually the battery cover that breaks)The first year I was thrilled with this sharpener; it was easy to use and made a nice clean, sharp point on pencils.Recently it has decided not to turn off. If it is plugged into the electric socket, it is running. Even if you remove the collection cup-- it continues running with the blades exposed. I did not purchase it on Amazon, but when I was looking up a replacement for it and saw the exact same one here, I felt I should warn others."
2,Paula,I already have one these and it works great. So I bought another one for my child's teacher. It died fast from being used too much. Kind of a disappointment since it was a gift.
1,Switch prone to break,"As others have noted, this sharpener's pencil-sensing on/off switch has a tendency to break. Ours is no longer operational, worked well until that switch broke."
5,going on three years,I've had this in the classroom for almost three years now and it's still going strong. I teach middle school so the kids aren't that gentle with it - I'm pretty impressed by how long it's held up. Too bad they don't have it available anymore.
3,Only Lasted One School Year,"I'm currently shopping for another sharpener for this coming school year. This Panasonic model, purchased last September, only lasted the school year (barely) with a class of 22 fifth-graders. Even then, I had to take it apart once to fix it (not very difficult -- all the parts are accessible, and I only had to slide a plastic piece back onto its post.) If I can find a more reliable sharpener, I will certainly spend extra to buy it, but this sharpener is probably a good value if you have less than 22 heavy users."
5,eating crow,"I can remember having the thought that people who use electric pencil sharpeners are a sad, pathetic little lot.Then I came to grips with how frustrating it is to pick up and try to use the blunt pencils that our four family members leave strewn across the domestic landscape.So I caved, trusted Costco to offer me the best one, and I'm eating humble pie.OK, I won't tell you this pencil sharpener changed my life. But almost.I've now sworn off pens for the frequent marking-up of books that I do, returning to a college-years, poormouse tradition of treating a book better than all that. With a pencil.It's easy because I've got a beautifully sharpened pencil within arm's reach no matter where I turn.You too can live this kind of deeply fulfilled life, and talk about your new Panasonic office tool at cocktail parties until your friends take you by the elbow and make you stop. Buy the pencil sharpener already."
5,Excellent book!!!!,"This is an excellent book, I have read through my copy many times and just bought a second copy for my niece."
4,Good Book,"Good book and worth getting, but you really need to get a shop manual to do any real maintenance... The book gives a good overview of different mechanical systems, and general maintaince procedures. It is a good read and I have reread it several times."
5,Lance is Inspirational,"I purchased this DVD a few weeks ago and I have to tell you; it sure is nice to have this time of year. The weather won't let me ride outside in this part of the country due to all this darn snow and the temp is going down to over twenty below tonight. There is no better way to spend a frigid evening, than attaching your bike to the trainerCycleOps Mag+ Indoor Bicycle Trainer Trainer with Bar Mounted Remote Shifterand watching Lance decimate the Tour De France field. You can't help but to increase your cadence. Lance may not ever come back, but I have him forever, in his prime, on DVD! Wish it was Hi-Def but common it's the Tour, they are lucky to just get a TV signal out half the time. Don't get me wrong the digital video quality of this DVD is fine. Enjoy it!!!"
4,lance 6 yeras of the Tour,"Good footage, original commentary by Phil Liggett and Bob Role, wraps up the 6 years of success Lance had in the Tour"
4,a good tv series,i enjoyed this series a good bit. it was an interesting view of a world i wasn't altogether familiar with. I would reccommend it for anyone who is interested in other points of view.
5,Pauline,"Positive:This fan is absolutely gorgeous. Seller (Del-Mar) was terrific when I spoke to him about this prior to purchase. Negative: the fan was shipped in it's own box without being in another box for protection. The box had massive damage to it & had been taped over with wide clear tape to hold it together. BUT, the contents appeared no worse for the wear as there was much Styrofoam inside to protect it. You should be aware though, that unless you have very high ceilings and install the fan with the LONG down-rod, you will NOT be able to install the 2 pieces of decorative scroll-work NOR the beautiful coupling cover over the motor housing, making the appearance flat above the motor housing and fan much less ornate looking than in the pictures. I have circled the parts that will not be able to be included in your fan installation. Highly recommend this seller and this item - just be aware that item will not look as pictured if the shorter down rod is used."
3,Del Mar is excellent,"The Minka-Aire gyro Fan is probably a pretty good product, however, the fan I received was defective. I installed it and while both fans worked electrically, one of the fans was binding internally and would not continue rotating. A call to M-A tech support quickly diagnosed the fan as defective and I was told to return it. I can't say enough good about Del Mar Designs, the Amazon Vendor. Shipment was paid by Del Mar both ways and their ""No Hassle"" return policy was truly no hassle. Credit was issued promptly."
3,Part left loose,"I ordered this fan for my home in Fl. It arrived on time using Amazon Prime. The box was in bad shape, but upon inspection all the parts were ok. The assembly and installation was easy. You have to use the long down rod to use some of the design features of the fan. After running the fan for about an hour I noticed a light knocking sound from one of the two fans. I did not want to send the fan back to Amazon. I removed the four screws from the fan housing and checked the blade. I found that a metric set screw was not tightened from the factory. I indexed the fan shaft on the flat and tightened the set screw. All quiet now."
5,A Wonderful Ride,"I still feel under the spell of Keith Fleming's wonderful memoir, The Boy with the Thorn in his Side. I read it over the weekend in 2 sittings. The opening pages grabbed me right away -- what an eccentric, fascinating family! Whether describing his first innocent sexual adventures, or his horrifying experience as the patient of a pyschiatrist/sadist, or his touching romance with an inner-city Latina, Fleming writes so well about what it feels like to be a teenager at the mercy of circumstances. And what circumstances! The book takes us through one extreme situation after another, always described with deep feeling and great sense of style. This book is so much more than a portrait of his uncle Edmund White. I recommend it to anyone interested in love, in families, in adolescence -- in life!"
2,Skip it,"What was the point of this book? Reading about Keith Flemming's life is like reading about your next door neighbor, Bob. Who cares? He sprinkles in some interesting stories about his life and learnings with Uncle Ed.. but the rest is trivial and boring."
4,Almost scared to listen to their other albums...,...'cause of some of the bad reviews this is getting- I really like it! Some great jams emerge as the album winds its way through spooky-cool experimentation. The saccharin ending and useless male vocal tracks are my only gripes.
3,Just O.K.,"My two favorite girl fronted bands put out new cds around the same time. While The Yeah Yeah Yeahs new more ""mature"" record is my favorite of theirs, Pretty Girls ""Elan Vital"" didn't fair as well (although how great will that ice cream cone look on a t-shirt). I've been a fan of PGMG from the beginning, and seen them live 3 or 4 times. Their album Good Health grabbed me, every song I loved, especially Sad Girls, Por Vida. The day their second album came out I was walking downtown in the rain to get my copy. It was less punk and more dance, but still awesome. This new record feels a world away from Good Health. Andrea gave up yelling, they lost a guitarist- and it makes a HUGE difference. It's not a bad record, it's just not the Pretty Girls I know and love. Tracks 3, 7 and 10 are great, and how come they waited till album #3 to let a dude sing? That track is awesome. Not sure which guy it is, but he has a very nice voice. So, maybe wait till ya have some extra cash or buy this one used."
1,Pretty Poor,"I think some of the other reviewers are being too kind to Pretty Girls Make Graves on this album. They have apparently abandoned their more melodic, interesting songs in favor of simple, boring dance-pop. To make matters worse, they aren't even really very good at dance-pop. Maybe the popularity of bands like Bloc Party has influenced them too much.The album could have been saved if it had been recorded better and performed with any amount of energy and enthusiasm. It sounds like it was recorded in a closet. This is probably one of the most disappointing releases that I've ever purchased, I'm sorry to say.Anyone looking for good Pretty Girls Make Graves records should purchase either ""Good Health"" or ""The New Romance"" because they are both great records. I can only hope that they return to their own style and put out some better records in the future."
2,What Happened?...,"The first time i heard this band was when i stumbled upon their song ""speakers push the air"". I loved the song so much i decided to buy their album. Well, unfortunately i bought the wrong album and got Elan Vital instead of Good Health. The first song started off with some reggae beat which was cool with me. As I continue listening to the whole album, it didn't quite capture my attention as I had expected. It seemed too mellow in a way. Where was that ""umph"" that i heard in speakers push air? they have probably tried to evolve from their previous albums. Well, it didn't work out in this one."
3,There Okay,These are a good idea and they work fine. Wish they were a little longer and it would be nice to have a soft material on the sides so if/when they brush up against your car they don't scratch the paint.
1,Cool but not alot of paint,"These things are cool to bring to wars but they spray for like a half-second of a little bit of paint, and they are waaayyy too much $$$ $5 a piece for a little tiny thing that is 1 time use only??? ehhh buy pballs instead of this..."
1,Overpriced,"I had the opportunity to test one of these for free. The spray range is limited, there is only a small amount of paint, and the spray only lasts a second or two. This product is a waste of money."
2,not that great,"I've used these things on multiple occasions for wood games and when we had to take an abandoned drive in theater candy shack. The only time I was impressed was when an oppenent was trying to get in the back entrance, little did he know I was on the roof and dropped one of these between his feet. It went off and coated him with a nice layer of paint. The other two times I used these they didn't go off and my oponent ended up throwing it back at my self. Nothing like being taken out by your own grenade. My advice, use paintballs instead"
3,"Good Price, Limited Use Applications","I bought this item to go inside of an adio/visiual cabinet to see when working with TV components and such. For the price, cannot beat it. Lights are cheaply made, all plastic. But for the right, limited use, they are a good product. They are serving my purpose just fine. Packaging was cheap. They were easy to install with the ability to custom fit the length of the puck light cords. Cords are thicker than other models."
5,"Se feliz, te dijo una lombriz??","perfecto, si fuera europa serian u2, amazing work of art, a must have!!! siento que me voy..."
5,One of the best bands in Latin America!,"This has got to be one of the best socially conscious rock groups that has surfaced in America. Bohemia Suburbana hits the right spot with sensitive and direct lyrics that pushes the right buttons without sacrificing the music. All the songs have a special feeling or mood to it. It is really sad that this group dissolved, would love to get their first cd. A must have for latin rock lovers!"
4,En mi opinion el mejor album de bohemia,"Bien este album para mi es el mejor de Bohemia, yo tengo la colección completa desde Sombras en el Jardin (el primero) Hasta Sub (El último), las mejores canciones son Planeta Hola, Peces e Iguanas, Azul, Oberol, detras de mama y aire, todas son buenas pero esas son mis preferidas, si les gusta el rock guatemalteco también debrian escuchar a Viernes Verde y Stress."
2,UNREALISTIC,"I thought that this book has some good facts but on the other hand, It had a really unrealistic feel to it. It sounds like the author, lives in a fairyland world far from what is really happening. I really did not enjoy the book and was very unhappy with the author's job on writing it."
5,"Feeling Great, Looking Hot, and Loving Yourself",I think that this book is a great source of information for teenagers. It provides great advice for teenagers feeling lost or confused. I think that every parent should have a copy of this book to give to their growing up child. I especially liked the foreward by Bettie B. Youngs.She sure is educated. The diet and exercise portion is exactly what teens need because they worry about their appearence so much.It tells about potion size which is the most important. My daughter loves this book!
1,"Outdated, old fashioned, and stereotypical","this book was dull, silly, and slightly offending. every single picture in this book was of blonde, gorgeous cheerleaders chatting up handsome white guys in track jackets. it seemed like the author had only concerns for white and beautiful people. whats more, the advice was not helpful and outdated."
5,a must-see for any film maven,"This film is a classic. You must see it if you love film history. A cross between ""Zelig"" and ""Spinal Tap"", it's provocative, inspiring and technically amazing. We have screened ""Forgotten Silver"" many times for friends and it never fails to confuse, bemuse and amuse. It is an essential film for fooling the pretentious and puzzling the naive. Don't tell your audience anything about it, except that it's short and worth seeing and then sit back and watch them out of the corner of your eye to see when they ""get it"". Have fun!"
3,Nancy's Opinion,The narration was interesting. Much of the story was padded though with their own made up material. Too bad they couldn't get more information from the man's wife. The film clips were pretty good for the time in which they were done. The only problem I had with it was the amount of story which was fictitious. I would have been happier if it had been historically accurate.
2,"There are better laptops at this price, avoid this one","At (less than) this price the HP Pavilion xt125 is a better choice. The 1.4 GHz Athlon XP ""1600+"" isn't a bad CPU but it lacks SSE2, and important feature for future software currently only found in Intel CPUs (AMD is adding it into their CPUs next year).The main problems are:The ATI Rage graphics are weak and out of date (don't even try to run a new game on it). The ATI MOBILITY RADEON 7500C is much faster and will even run 3D games smoothly.The SDRAM is being run a 200MHz. This memory is not very stable at that speed and gets very hot. You are better off with faster and more efficient DDRAM which runs at a slower speed but sends more data so it drains less power from the battery, runs cooler, and pumps more data to your CPU. Sony is just cutting cost here at the consumer's expense.I used to like Sony laptops but they are just trading on their name these days."
2,One headache after another...,"I bought this computer one year ago and have lost an unacceptable amount of time trying to fix its many problems. First, VAIOs are known for having DVD sound problems. Mine was no exception. Second, this VAIO does not operate properly with many common programs, especially Adobe Photoshop(it shuts itself off in the middle of work). Third, the battery life is so low as to be an embarrassment. Fourth problem with the VAIO = NOT ENOUGH MEMORY - thinking I wouldn't need more than a 20 gig hardrive was a big mistake! Shop around for your next laptop and DON'T buy a Sony VAIO. You will be sorry."
4,Not too shabby for the price,"After many years ... well 2 years ... and much heartache, I 86-ed my Compaq Presario laptop, and bought the Vaio FXA63. Much to my surprise, this little box did everything I wanted. Game performance was fine, and I found the graphics to be quite acceptable. Love being able to put 2 batteries in it. Best of all: Solaris x86 runs on it like a dream. (Get the realtek driver and XFree86 drivers and away you go.) Snappy little box; envy of all my working friends (except those who upgraded to the FVR-28). Wish it had a bigger drive and DVD writer, but for a year ago it was awesome."
2,Is this a Soap Opera?,"I'm reading the Tower books with my kids, and I'm about ready to call it quits! Number three...yet another book providing little satisfaction in the story. I'm feeling like this series is more about selling books than anything else! I feel like we're tuning in to the never-ending soap opera at several bucks a pop. At this rate, Tal's mom will die of old age before he ever gets her out of that coma!"
4,Horror at its best! It's a Scream,If you like Horror and scary movies you'll love 'Krazy 4 U'. Abbie Grant is being stalked by a mysterious person who claims to be Krazy 4 her. She almost gets run over then the phone calls and frightening messages start. When reading this book you never know what will happen next. When the truth is uncovered it leaves you spellbound and itching to read it again. A MUST-READ.
5,BLOOD CURDLING CHILLER!,"This book is a must read! I must admit, when I first got this book I thought it would be really bad. Boy was I wrong! I can honestly say I could not put this book down!! You suspect different people and almost every single page! It is a Excellent thriller! It made me not want to go out after dark! Even on my front porch! It keeps you on edge and you won't rest until you find out who it is. I read this in 2 hours, because I couldn't put it down! However I read it at night, which was a big mistake. It scares you out of you wits!"
2,Boring...,"This was a boring novel. Abbie is a dim-witted character, the stupid health nut. The story is boring, and the pace is typical. The story leads up to a stupid conclusion, though, I can say, A. Bates's climaxes in her books are somewhat better than someone like R.L. Stine, who couldn't write something thrilling if he tried! All in all, Krazy 4 U was a monotonous book, and the story can go in the pile with the rest of the crap that builds up about dumb girls, their dream guys, and villians with stupid motives."
4,A simple and enchanting movie,"The first time I saw this movie, I was nine or ten years old. It had aired on television and I truly fell in love with it. I am now 18, but I still remember how simple yet enchanting it was to watch. It brought to life one of my absolute favorite fairy tales of all time! There are a few scenes I never forgot: the Punch and Judy show, the donkey that eats Maria's custard, and when Hansel and Gretel meet the witch. Up until now, I haven't been able to find this movie. However, I recently ended my search when I bought a copy off of amazon.com. Not only is it in excellent condition, but it has brought my childhood memories back!"
2,Peacock Fan,"Katherine Gordon has ideas - fabulous ones at that. But that is all. She has no clue how to write a novel. Her novels are easy read and hold relatively no suspense. It is almost as if one can easily foresee all the events that lead to the end. Really Ms. Gordon, if you have one ounce of respect for your audience, you will not take up a pen again."
5,What a great read!,Bloom is an absolutely enjoyable read. Linda Dominique Grosvenor is the kind of craftsman that weaves her story so well you forget the world she takes you to isn't the real one. I loved this book!
5,BLOOM is CAPTIVATING...,"Bloom is captivating, mind-blowing and a wonderful emotional read.I have never read a novella so captivating, well rounded, fast, believable and daring...and when Lily said, ""I'm going to love him like my life depended on it."" I could have fell out of my chair.Thanks Dom...for writing what love should be. Many people need to read and learn a great lesson...forget opinions and love freely.Wow!"
4,Best quality,"Very strong, yet soft and does not fall apart on the face after wiping off cleansers. It is recommended !"
3,GREAT LOOKING - SOUND LACKING,"THIS RADIO IS AWESOME LOOKING, MADE REALLY WELL. THE SOUND COULD BE BETTER. IT SOUNDS A LITTLE TOO BASSY AND MUFFLED. I HAVE A PRETTY BIG KITCHEN, THATS WHERE I HAVE IT, AND I REALLY CAN NOT HERE IT TOO WELL IN THE NEXT ROOM OVER. OVERALL, IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS FOR JUST ONE ROOM IT'S OK, BUT IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON LEAVING IT IN A ROOM TO LISTEN THROUGHOUT YOUR HOUSE OR APARTMENT, I WOULD LOOK ELSEWHERE. I HOPE THIS HELPED YOU A BIT."
1,I would give it Zero stars if I could,"I loved the product when I got it. But barely 7 weeks after I received it, it simply stopped working -- no apparent cause. It just died. Teac warranty only covers repair, so I had to schlep it around. The first ""authorized service center"" I took it to wouldn't even take it, for whatever reason. The second one fixed it, and three weeks later, it's dead again. This is a true lemon. I've contacted Teac twice and they simply couldn't care less. Don't buy this!!!"
2,Not so good,"I'm sorry to say something less than enthusiastic about this album, but I found it to be pretty rough listening. Hiromi does play with a fair degree of virtuosity, but the music as a whole seems tepid at best. The rhythm section is weak, seemingly lacking a sense of dynamics. The electronic parts seemed to have been tacked on as some afterthought, kitsch rather than interesting. Given the fact that electronic beats are so malleable, the electronic parts here seem particularly banal.It's difficult for me to understand how the editorial review puts this music in the same league as The Bad Plus."
3,Piano Tunes Are Good,"I first heard Hiromi on a Jazzizz CD, and I really liked the tune (""Summer Rain"" from her CD Another Mind). So I thought I'd give her new one a shot. Well... the tunes where she plays just the piano are fine, but on about half the tunes she plays electric keyboards. Now, I am no way against electric keyboards (in fact I am big fan of prog rock, which has piles of electric keyboards). When Hiromi plays the electric keyboards, IMHO it sounds like noise. Give this one a listen before you buy it. It just isn't my cup of tea."
2,Poor Quality Control,"This mounting system skid adapter for my Warn ATV snow plow looked great and initially fit well - but the hole for the snow skid on one of the adapters was too small. I tried reaming it out and then realized that even when the skid fit the adapter, the holes were not aligned. I had to do a lot of work to make it partially fit. Would not buy this again. It should fit perfectly out of the box as this is a model specific skid adapter system."
3,beware,The product does not fit all warn plows. Be sure to make certain it will fit on your particular plow.
1,Avoid the Kindle edition!!,"As is becoming depressingly evident, Penguin publishers show utter contempt for the Kindle. This is the third defective Penguin e-book that I have purchased for the Kindle, and it is clear that nobody has bothered to proof-read or format these works properly. Font sizes change randomly; words, sometimes 5 at a time, run into each other; and notes are often intrusive in the poetic texts, altering the line lengths. This edition of the Prelude, however, is the worst: as it is a parallel text edition, one would expect to be able to distinguish between the two versions, but no, it is as if it is one massive poem, with nothing to orient you to the differences except when the occasional line number recurs. Hopefully Oxford Classics will bring out more Kindle editions, as they seem to care about their readership.Also avoid the Penguin versions of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov."
1,KINDLE EDITION only,"Disclaimer: This review is specific to the Penguin digital edition for the Kindle, which offers a side-by-side comparison of the texts from two different editions of THE PRELUDE. Sounds like a lovely idea, but apparently digital reading technology isn't quite up to the task. The Kindle reading app, at least on my Asus Transformer tablet, doesn't know how to handle the dual texts, so turning pages becomes a big ordeal, whether you read vertically (1-page spread) or horizontally (2-page spread). The book's only a buck, so if you're desperate, hop to... but prepared to be frustrated when you actually get the file open."
1,Old stock from 2006!,"I received mine with a label stating it was made in 2006. The packaging was faded like it was sitting in the sunlight for years. Upon opening the filter box, the filter element had no light coating of oil on it. Apparently 6 years sitting on the shelf deteriorated the oil. When I shined some light through the filter element, I can see small holes, which means the filter itself is deteriorating. The seller was from Amazon.com and usually they never get it wrong but this time they did. I sent this one back and ordered a replacement. Will post details when I get that one.3/28/12 Update: After a series of return/exchanges, the third filter was of great quality. Made in 2/2012, no oil or filter material problems!"
5,The Best,"Best filter money can buy. Great price, paid about the same amount for this filter that the dealer wanted to charge me for the OEM replacement filter of MUCH lesser quality. I also bought one for my wifes car."
3,Buyers beware,"The product overall is good HOWEVER, when I received the hex bar, the product was barely wrapped. Half the wrapping material was ripped off and the product was scratched all over- mind you this was supposed to be a gift. The only reason why I did not return it was because I was able to wash off SOME of the scratches and because I did not want to go through the hassle of returning. But buyers beware."
4,Very Easy to use and sooo Cute!,"When I had my first daughter 7 yrs. ago and a mother of 4 w/ one on the way they only had full size pack n' plays, so I love this because it easily fits thru any doorway and is just soo adorable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because if they are going to market this as a bassinet, it should have storage under it. Almost all other traditional bassinets have some type of storage underneath, This is just a smaller version of a full size pack n' play with a hood. I would still recommend it though!"
3,Legendary,"They could've had more of their classics, instead of new material and collaborations. I thought it was the best of Full Force."
3,Spy? lens,"Well, the lens does what is claimed for it - it does take pictures to the side, and good ones - but it is not anything like a ""spy"" lens, as it is huge! and obvious! The immense size calls attention to it in the first place, and the giant mirror inside is really obvious. Anyone looking at the camera will see themselves in the mirror and know that you are taking their picture. For someone not to know you are taking their picture, they would have to be pretty oblivious, in which case, you might as well shoot them straight on, rather than from the side."
2,Nice LOOKING watch. Poor quality,"I bought this watch as an anniversary gift for my husband.. This watch looks fantastic but is POOR quality for the price you are paying. In the first week of wearing it, my husband took our son to the pool not taking it off due to it being water resistant... Water leaked in and destroyed this watch in seconds. Very disappointing for the Bulova brand. Needless to say we are now dealing with Bulova warranty."
4,Looks much more expensive than the price,"First of all, I'll never buy a watch from anyone other than Amazon. After doing a lot of shopping, you can't come close to the price. I received the watch at my office and the first comment from someone that saw it was ""Wow, that's an expensive watch"". I asked a co-worker how much he thought I paid, and he guessed 700-800. Bulova makes a great looking watch. It looks much better in person than the photos. Feel is heavy but not too heavy, the watch is big but not too big... thick but not too thick. There is only one thing keeping me from the 5th star. If I tilt it to each side there is about 1mm of play in the second hand (which is actually only used for the chronograph). Instead of staying dead center at the 12 o'clock position it shifts half a millimeter side to side. Hardly a reason to return it, and I'm sure I'm the only one that will ever notice it. But for 5 stars it should be absolutely 100% flawless."
4,Great Watch,"I really like this watch. It is heavy and looks very nice - it is also big, but I wouldn't say too big. Would have been 5-stars if it had a sweeping second hand & a screw-down crown. What looks like a second hand is just for the tachymeter/stop watch function. The 60-second hand is actually the dial located at the 6-o'clock position."
4,Really nice watch!,I love my watch! Good size and weight - feels really solid and looks expensive. Great price for $175. Macy's sells for twice as much.
5,a well done precise history of a powerful man.,I believe that any freshman legislator and all students studying the history of Washington State should read this historical novel. It should be part of the corriculum of all schools in Washington State and be availabe in all of the state libraries.
2,The misinformation (or disinformation) . . .,"in the equipment sections is truly scary. Sure, if you leave a pinch collar on a dog's neck all of the time, there will be reddened areas--but the same will happen if you leave any collar on for long periods. Pinch collars aren't intended to hurt (and if it hurts the dog, the trainer is using it incorrectly); rather, they exert even pressure around the dog's neck. Ordinary buckle ollars do more damage to a dog's trachea due to pulling than pinch collars do--and harnesses actually *encourage* pulling! (Why do you think they are used for sled dogs?!) I agree with the author's rejection of head harnesses, but only because they are *dangerous*, not because they leave dogs depressed. I'm sure the booklet is useful to some people, but I just couldn't get past those statements."
5,Great game,"I just bought this game for my daughters 5th birthday. I have 3 daughters, twins that are 7 and my 5 year old. I was looking for a unique game that can't be bought at wal-mart. Something new and different. This is it!! We had a great time playing this game. The girls wanted to play and play. Fun for parents too because it is a pretty quick game. Also the fruit is wooden, durable and so cute. Only complain is the baskets, they are very cheap and are already breaking, but I don't think this is a big deal because I am sure I can find some different small baskets to use. It is a little pricey but I think it will last a very long time, it is very well made besides the baskets. It has 10 pears, 10 apples, 10 cherrys and 10 plums. These each run about $2.50 each so it's really not that highly priced. Also it's not made in china where something is recalled everyday, you can trust Haba toys!"
5,Buy it from the UK Amazon site,This is a great book but don't be sucked into buying it for 150 dollers goto the UK site and get it for 8 bucks. Ships just as fast.http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0261103474/ref=sr_aps_books_1_2/026-5367973-8334817
3,"A Cheeky, But Shallow Romp with King Arthur in WWII England","""The King"" is a tongue in cheek fable of King Arthur and his Round Table being transported to 1940 England. They rabble rouse away with all bravado while their exploits become fodder for the propaganda out of Nazi Germany.Funny at times, but all the while I was wishing for a more what if? tale of King Arthur and his Knights doing battle in WWII Europe. Would have made for an interesting story...but, it would have been written by a different writer as this is more Barthelme's style.>>>>>>><<<<<<<A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."
5,Still Need The Typewriter,Needed a typewriter to produce two-part forms. The Daisywheel that came with typewriter was 10 pitch. Needed the 12 pitch option to fill in a lot of information into a small space. Worked great!
4,"Excellent, especially the early years","Leni Riefenstahl is a genius, but her life (tragically) was ruined by some poor choices and the fact she was erroneously labelled after the war as ""Hitler's mistress."" Here she sets the record straight and includes some marvelous never-before revealed vignettes on Hitler, Goebbels and other members of the Nazi hierarchy.Riefenstahl writes of how Hitler was walking with her on the sand on the Baltic sea and makes a sexual pass in 1932 as his entourage discreetly hovers in the background. Leni rejects the pass, as she rejects more vehemently Goebbels' more crude attempts to bed her later on.There is much more, obviously, that this type of gossip, but it's riveting nonetheless. If you are an admirer of Leni's cinematic brilliance or curious about her real relationship with Hitler, this is a must read."
5,"Leni Reifenstahl, A Memoir","I wrote a review for this book on January 11. You did not print my review in it's entirety. At the very end I defended Leni Reifenstahl by saying that ""She should tell all her negative critics to go to hell""!"
5,Triumph of the postcard,"Nothing says ""Wish you were here"" like Leni Riefenstahl. This fantastic book of 30 detachable postcards spans Riefenstahl's entire career, and provides compelling imagery for anything you might care to write to your friends, relatives, or fuhrer."
1,SO?????????,"A Studs Terkel-like verbal history of the role of the talent agency in Hollywood; with a particular focus on the Mailroom where the movers and shakers get their start. The book is a never ending compilation of interviews with the men who made it after paying their dues in the servitude of the Mail Room. For those in the industry it is probably fascinating lore. For me, it was one big bore."
3,This is why books need editors,"The book is a collection of anecdotes, a collection that is far larger than it needs to be. The author seems desperate to show us how comprehensive he can be, putting in everything he possibly could instead of culling out the mundane.For every anecdote that is interesting, insightful, entertaining, etc...--in other words, worthwhile--there are half a dozen that all read like this:""How did I get into the business? I don't know, let me see. I wasn't doing anything with my life, but my aunt knew a guy at [insert agency here]. I interviewed. They said there was no way they could offer me a job. A week later they offered me a job. I took it.""Now if the interviewee is a Hollywood big shot, o.k., but if not....Basically it's a nice rough draft for the book it could have been had someone applied a stronger editorial hand and produced a much tighter, ""punchier"" work."
4,"good book, but too easy for most 2nd graders","This book lists grade 1-2 words in seven groups and gives interesting problems/questions for them. Inside each group, it presents related words together to teach their different uses. Most words have repeating drills for memorizing their meanings. Its colorful pictures attract my child's attention. A well-composed book. But buyers should be careful that it is probably too easy for your 2nd grader. Words listed such as all, him, say, us, your, open, and etc. should go to the 1st grade.I bought it for my 1st grader and it works great. Knowing there is often such a grade level gap, I go to bookstores to check book content. I also let my child use the online weekly exercises from Beestar (http://www.beestar.org) and compare her level with peers. If you pay attention, you should have a good idea about your child's skill level, not misled by some books.But overall, this is a good book. I recommend it to 1st graders though."
2,local tv show on Lewis and Clark,I found this local TV produced television series rather hard to watch and at times much to elementary with regard to the Corps of Discovery. Would not purchase again or new second in series.
2,disappointed,Being a lover of 60's and seventies folk music was disappointed that this album had very few songs that I liked or was familiar with.
5,great quality,"I had an old set of these wrenches that lasted for years but I lost the ones that I need the most. I bought a Craftsmen set and I was so disappointed, they stripped very easily. So, I came back to Bondhus. They are strong and hold up very well, and even with shipping charges they are still cheaper then Craftsmen. I like them in silver so I can tell them from my Metric set (also Bondhus). I highly recommend these wrenches."
3,Where's the Other Singer?,"saw this band live in Boston & couldn't help but notice that the lead singer was different than the one on the album! Erin was good on some things, but she didn't sing any of Alison Winston's songs nearly as well as Alison did. There was no explanation of illness or anything & I felt kind of deceived. The CD is a good one, but I didn't like them live."
4,An encouraging debut.,"Melodies are on haunting Syracuse, reminiscent on Jazz America, angry on Best Regards, and sweet on Water & Dreams. I enjoyed this CD a lot. An encouraging debut."
5,"Exciting, Interesting, Fast-Paced, A MUST READ BOOK!","I stayed up all night to finish the book, because, I couldn't put it down! Outstanding historical opening, which makes readers wonder about their own family story from Africa. Realistically written family relationships--we all have relatives described in the book. ARB makes us want to know our own family history by her creative story-telling."
4,Very good - worth it,For the price and the chance that this was an impulse buy - I am very pleased with this cd. One of the better classical compilations I have had in a long while!
2,Looks regal on a shelf but that's about it..,"I picked this book up at random in a little used book store. I read the first page and was flabbergasted. The vivid imagery in that first tantalizing paragraph was astounding. I took it home immediately. Unfortunately nothing else in the book even came close to competing with those first wonderful words.The main character was a whiney drama queen that gives a bad name to women throughout history, even keeping in mind this book was published in 1924, which is pretty bad. In fact she remains my last reason for never wanting to pick up another book written by a woman (I've just never had any luck with them!)Needless to say I only lasted 84 pages before I just got too plain annoyed to continue on. The book is now employed as a dusty old paper weight."
2,Where Are The Pockets?,Amazon Please correct this error with these pants. These Big & Tall Men's Pants have NO POCKETS!
1,Misrepresented item,"The discription of the shorts is misleading. Most manufactures label shorts by the inseam not the whole lenght of the shorts. I thought I was purchasing shorts with an inseam of 22 inches. My son is 6'11"" and the shorts hit him at his thigh."
2,not mesh,Shorts received were not mesh but plain cotton shorts. Could have got from another vendor cheaper. Not clear in their description.
5,Fun Collection,Anne Cochran tours with Jim Brickman therefore I was a fan prior to getting this CD but I have really enjoyed listening to her sing some of my favorite songs. I will add more of her CDs to my collection.
3,No Leader?,I love the Nightmare At Maplecross album. I have the cassette version and it contains the old Gary Glitter classic-Leader Of The Gang- which is not present here. This song comes after Tiger Feet and Gary himself lends his vocals to it. That is why I only give this cd 3 stars.
5,love this series,"If you loved The Daughters of The moon you will love the sons of the dark. I just finished reading Outcast, it was great, and it made me appreciate and like Kyle better then i had before. The only thing i recommend is that you read all of the sons before you read daughters 13, because in daughters 13 it kind of tells you what happens to the guys, but that won't stop me from reading the rest of the sons. All in all these books ROCK!"
1,Don't buy blu ray version,"Love this movie, but I am totally unsatisfied with the quality of the blu ray version...beware the blu ray version is no better than the cheaper DVD version and the movie completely stopped 5 minutes before the ending. I guess blu ray no longer means 1080p."
5,Great family movie,I saw this movie years ago and loved it. I just bought it for my grandchildren who are pet lovers and they loved it as well.
4,Tear jerker with a twist,"I remember seeing this movie when it came out, and the themes in the movie made me cry out of sadness and anger at how the animals were treated in the story, and tears of joy at the ending.Sadly, the whole movie was somewhat hypocritical. There are reports of the chimps being beaten by the animal trainers based on eye witness accounts, a brief conversation with the trainers, and observations of 5 of the chimps after they were taken to a sanctuary after filming ended. This information can be found in the book: Visions of Caliban on Chimpanzees and People, pages 148 and 149Visions of Caliban On Chimpanzees and PeopleThe film is touching, beautifully made, and the story delightful. Unfortunately the movie doesn't practice what its story preaches."
2,audio quality lowers rating,"While I enjoyed the movie itself, the audio quality was not consistent. I'm not sure if the problem is limited to this particular copy or if the entire pressing of this version is affected. Consequently, I can only give two stars for this movie."
5,Envaluable book for LDS addicted family members,"This very impressive book has a message that all Latter-Day-Saint (LDS) chruch members should read. In fact, since almost everyone has an addict family member or friend, everyone should read it. I was impressed how Phil S. could fall so far, from a chruch leder and seminary teacher to an alcoholic who lost everything. Phil S. tells a day by day account of his struggle to overcome his addiction, and how LDS chruch members treated him. It gave me a new perspective on my alcoholic family members.The book explains the best way to help an addicted family member or friend. This book is a great resource for LDS leaders, pastors, and priests to help their members over come addiction. I give the book five stars."
3,Only buy if you don't have Rude Awakening,"These are the same songs that are on the live Rude Awakening CD from a few years ago. They're good songs and everything, but if you already have Rude Awakening then you have no reason to buy this. And really I'd suggest buyingRude Awakeninginstead. Same songs, plus more. A little more expensive but its worth it."
2,Extended verions of what?,"All tracks are live - nothing ""extended"" that I could tell. If you have their box set, then you most likely do not need this."
5,Your CRAZY if you don't like her!,"This video is a true testimony to the power of celine. From the minute she appears and belts her contemporary ballads, you can't help but be captivated. she also shows a side of her that doesn't come with her image, her fast Rock/Dance side. She displays enough energy in this concert to make you sweat, just watching! She then brings it all home with a song from her heart. I belive she is the Best performer of all time. And this Video is a testiment of her gift,energy, and talent. If you like celine , you must have this!"
2,Corrupted my files. :(,"This drive is very attractive and small. That's the main reason I decided on this brand. The others were just too big and would be awkward on my keyring. However, once I got it home, I found that I could write files to it, but could only read about 1 - 2 files off of it before it gave me a ""corrupt file"" error. I was using Win XP with it on both a desktop and laptop and both USB 2 and USB 1.1 ports. I'll just stick to my PNY Flash Memory Card. It's 64 MB, fast and has never had a problem."
4,Nice wheel but without roller bearings,It just came with a metal tube that fits in the through hole. Wheel material is soft and works well for my application.
3,Steelex D2650 Casters with Roller Bearings,"I received 1 of the 8 wheels that I ordered through Amazon. The remaining 7 have been shipped. The wheel appears to be of reasonable quality but is not what it was advertised to be. The wheel that I received does not have a roller bearing hub but rather a metal bushing. I see this as deceptive advertising. I hope I am not terribly disappointed in its performance. If I was not in need of these wheels, I would return the entire order."
3,It works but did not last,"I am not exactly sure how long this is supposed to last but it only lasted about a year before it broke again. Unfortunately, this time when it broke, the kick pedal ended up poking a hole in a nearly new Evans Batter head. Yeah, I know it sucks, right? I can only give it 3 stars.."
3,Heavy duty hinge,I was disappointed with this hinge because the picture made it look bigger than it is. It is very small for a hinge but the quality looked good and there was no description of the size
1,Now you can DOWNGRADE!!,"I was very disappointed with this software. I already own the Hoyle Card Games (includes Bridge) and the Hoyle Bridge and Euchre. Both of these are much easier to play, and do not come with large accessory programs.The Action menu does not allow Redeal, Rebid or Replay - once the hand is dealt, you are stuck with it. Also, even though Expert levels are selectible for the players, they frequently mis-bid causing an incorrect contract.Don't waste you money."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have copies of Hoyle bridge games from the past and bought this program because it promised so much. But they are promises not kept. It is basically the same program that you can buy from Staples or Office Depot at their $10 kiosks. They throw in a deck of cards and a score sheet. It says it plays duplicate bridge but I couldn't find it. The help files are not compatible with Vista. I was unable to locate the advertised ""hints"" that are supposedly available. And try to get some information from their web site. Actually, try to find their web site. If you find their web site, try to contact them for support. It's a hassle, if not impossible. If you want the game, buy the cheaper edition. Same program. Same game. Buy your own cards and scoresheet."
2,Not very good for beginners wanting to learn bidding,"This box actually includes two bridge games. One is the standard Hoyle game, with the face creator and opponents like Harley the bear. It is very similar (if not exact) to the bridge game in the Hoyle Card Games package. This game does not provide hints.The other game is MVP Bridge Deluxe, which is a very old shareware title written for Windows 3.1. The copyright is 1994-1998. This is the one with the advertised in-game hints. Unfortunately, the hints are not very helpful to someone who wants to learn how to bid. For example, it will prompt you to bid something like ""1NT"", but then it does not offer any information as to why that is the proper bid.I suppose that if you already know how to play, this might be fun, but then again, you would be better off getting the Hoyle Card Games package, as it has many more games and is less expensive."
1,Terrible at Any Price,I picked this game up on a whim while visiting LA for only 9.99. It did come with the cards and score pad. I'm sorry I did not try to order here. I would have read the reviews and would not buy it at any price. I will echo the other reviews. Bidding is ridiculous and play is almost as bad. Do not buy!
1,Bridge clun,"I had an old dos program called Bridge that had Hints, options, set-ups, etc. I was looking for something like this and thought because of the price that it would be a step above the Bridge on Hoyle cards. As it turned out, it would not load onto my cmputer, so it waa a complete waste of money. It was not as advertised. I will never buy another game from Amazon.com"
2,"OK, I should have believed the reviews","It's poor and no hints, no play over (has review play over), only 3 settings for difficulty, easy, normal, expert. No teaching aids, no explanation of what is a good move or bad. Plain Jane game, does not play well!Computer opponents had 29 points 15 and 14 the bidding went 1 club pass pass passThey made 12 tricks (yes if bid a small slam) they got credit for 1 club. This was on normal play level, I'd hate to see easy.No not always so poor and you can have some fun but if your serious about bridge or if you want to leaen, forget this game.FORGET THIS GAME"
5,used for many years and love it!,I have used several years and on all kinds of different cars. This product is everything and more it is advertised to be. Love not having to dry and no spotting!
1,Stupid & Pointless,"First of all, what happened with the mask? it looked horrible. Whoever played Myers in this one really was lame. The plot again with the little girl (Harris) was again pointless. No wonder they discarded these 3 sequels in the 7th part. The acting was okay, some roles should have been ostracized but whatever. Michael Myers could have been done better but it's always been regarded as the worst in the franchise along side Resurrection.The killings are even stupider, stemming from how he killed Tina and the ones in the barn. Really dumb and the ending was a tie in to the 6th part which is by far the worst in the series in my opinion."
2,"Awful movie, I believe on the original halloween movie is worth to keep.",I did not like it. This is just another resurection of Michael Myers. The plot was weak and not fun at all.
3,Halloween 5,It was a gift for a friend. They enjoyed the movie. It is not my type of movie. I could recommend.
2,No better than Lonely Planet's book,"I recently travelled to Kyoto, Hiroshima and Tokyo after buying both this book and ""Lonely Planet Japan"" in Spring of 2004. While I found the energy of this book to be superior to the LP and better able to answer the ""what's there to eat in Kyoto?"" - type questions, the writing style of ""Let's Go"" is simply atrocious. Most of the eating options that were featured were simply noodle fill-up joints. What happens when you had ramen yesterday? The fawning over their favorite ryokan in Tokyo (the ONLY unfriendly place in my trip) is unjustified. I found LP much more useful in getting around the cities I visited, although neither book offered much help in the How to Get Cash at Night in Japan category. LP was also better for pre-trip planning. My advice is to grab the Fodor's / Frommer's guide when it comes out next."
4,Amazing album,"Please be patient, don't pay too much attention to the title. While the streets were pretty much the underground US favorite of many indie-pop kids looking for something new, one has to appreciate the maturity that Mike shows us in the new album; talking about his coke problem, talking about being a rising star, and in the end, all of it taking him over. This albums is well-polished, sounds great, but gets whiny at times. If you liked Original Pirate Material, compare it to tracks like ""Weak Become Heroes,"" ""Too Much Brandy,"" or ""Don't Mug Yourself,"" although a bit more...upbeat. If you liked A Grand Don't Come For Free, you will love the entire album. Standouts include ""Prangin' Out,"" ""The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living,"" ""All Goes out the Window,"" ""Can' Con an Honest John,"" ""When You Wasn't Famous,"" and ""Never Went to Church."" Yes, the album cover (and the album) is a bit self-indulgent and shallow, but do not let that deter you from a great purchase."
4,Good commentary,"A very thorough and readable commentary on the book of Galatians, using the best of conservative modern scholarship.A great tool for any serious student of the New Testament."
3,"It worked...not the greatest, but it worked",It was a rinky-dink type of deal that ended up requiring two people. I'm a hobbiest not a true mechanic so I'm sure the tool wasn't the only problem. I didn't care for it much but it did get the job done and I don't have a $100 tool laying around that I'll never use again.
1,junk,"This ""tool"" is a waste of money. The metal it's made of is too soft. The wrench spreads apart when you apply force to loosen a tight fan."
5,"Great! Spiral-bound, easy to use.",The crosswords are really fun! The book is lightweight and easy to lay in your lap and fill in the puzzles. The puzzles are quite large so there's enough room to fill in the letters just fine. Great layout!
5,Cliff,"Incredible CD. Really. If you want to take an international journey without artificial assistance (except your sound system), this album provides the trip. I was given this album several years ago by someone who doesn't like ""new age"" music. Yet, I would not classify this work in that category. I have only listened to the soundbites, provided by Amazon, to compare this album with Chris' other works. It is not the same. This is one of the best albums I own. When I am upset, cannot sleep or just need to change the subject in my head's jibberish--it's the only thing that works for me. Thanks Chris."
2,Not his best effort,"Pretty disappointing considering some of his earlier work, especially his collaborations with Paul Voudouris. I guess it's an attempt at a more ethnic style of new age music, but he has done much better."
5,Hurray for Women!,"This is my favorite of the entire Uppity Women series. Although the Bible and historians don't tell us much about women in ancient times, the author has found out a lot about them. She has done a thorough job of researching her subjects' stories and the history surrounding them, and gives us delightful ""dirt"" as well as making her readers realize how important and powerful women have always been.I own the entire series, and often go back and read about some of the women who were important in their lifetimes, but often totally neglected by historians. These are not dry historical essays. The women really come to life in Vicki Leon's writings."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"This is probably the worst book I have ever started reading. Never ever in my life had I left the book unfinished. But with this one, I simply couldn't afford to waste my time. I hoped to find a decent scholarly work on some of the most important women of old. But the criterion for the author seemed to be ANY mentioning of ANY woman in ancient documents. And needless to say, most of them are just a little bit more (or not even that) than your regular ""street girl"". I kept asking myself who did she write this book for? Who was her target audience? Her language is mediocre, vulgar and tedious. Did she want to be funny?! As someone has already said, it's a shame that she conducted such a serious research only to publish something that no historian will ever consider worth studying. Simply, it was an ordeal to read. Thank God I didn't waste my money on it. It was given to me as a present."
2,So much history (herstory?) buried under flip nonsense.,"I feel sorry for the author, Vicky Leon, who is trying to appeal to the cheap side of her readers, if there is such a thing. She obviously has done a good amount of research, but her cliched, hackneyed writing style and attempts to be ""cute"" make it impossible for me to read with seriousness or enjoyment. Frankly, and I must admit this with some guilt, I bought the book just for factual information-- names, dates, general data-- but with chapter headings such as ""Pharaohs, Physicians, Fat Cats & Filly-Fanciers"" and ""Singers, Sexual Stand-Ins & a Sassy Slave or Two"" and practically every sentence containing duds such as ""good old Sam,"" ""put him off,"" ""let it all hang out,"" ""dear old grandma,"" etc., etc., etc., it's impinging on a clear desire to learn what I should already know....Ok, if I'm such a deadbeat, let's make it two and a half stars."
2,The women in this work did not seem great to me.,"THis book was dry in some places and the stories seemed incomplete and the book did not flow. Some of the women featured did not seem great to me, at least not great enough to be featured in the book. THe women were portrayed to be male crazed and there seemed to be a great number of concubines who wanted power. The authors purpose of showing women were people too, who weren't just wives or the mother of.. was shown in some cases but in many they were just that. The book should have been comprised of longer stories of less women."
2,"Good concept, but go elsewhere for in depth information","I really appreciate the thought behind this series of books but constantly find myself frustrated at the tiny amount of space given to each subject. I always want to know more and am annoyed when that's all there is. I would instead recommend something like ""The Mammoth Book of Outrageous and Heroic Women"", which gives you a one paragraph summary of each woman, but then goes on to give you another six or eight pages of detail."
5,Wonderful stories,"I bought this book thinking that I would read it some day with my kids. I tried one out on my almost 3 year old, and he has taken to asking for the ""god book"" every night at bed time. We are Unitarian Universalists, and this book really goes well with our belief that god is not just some man in the sky, or that had contact w/humans many years ago and then stopped. The book talks about how god is everywhere and how we are all connected. The stories are well written and uplifting. I think a child or adult who is not a UU would also enjoy the book, as it does not go against anything their church teaches as far as I know."
5,I LOVE this ring!!!,"This is one of my favorite ever rings!!! :) It is sooo pretty and makes my hands look more feminine (chunky rings don't work, unfortunately, on my hands very well). It is my beautiful birth stone, the ring is well made and of good quality. I absolutely LOVE this ring!!!"
5,Such A Lovely Little Ring,"This is a very nice ring, it's pretty, it isn't too overbearing, and it will make a great Valentine's Day gift. It didn't take any time at all to get here, and I got exactly what I wanted. I will certainly look for more items to buy from Silver Insanity."
4,cute and princess-ey,It's lightweight and sweet. Could be for a young person as well. It's sweet and the stone is a light color. Fast delivery. I think it's very feminine and worth the price.
2,Not as blue as shown,"It is a pretty ring but I was disappointed with the color, it is not as blue as shown in the picture"
2,Poor customer service,"Shipped quickly the wrong ring. Wanted me to pay for return shipping on their mistake. Took almost a month to get proper ring shipped to me. I gave an extra star for the ring as it is a very nice ring. Procede with caution on purchasing. If you get the problem I got, get Amazon involved quicker than I did. It wasn't until I contacted Amazon, rather than company directly that I got results."
1,unsatisfied,I purchased this ring and was very disapointed. I had it less than 24 hours before it turned my finger green. This is a sign of poor quality. I have been wearing sterling silver for over 25 years and have only had this happen with cheap costume jewlery. I wont be purchasing any more from this company.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this ring after purchasing the Amazon Amber Celtic Love Knot ring and loving it and I have to say I am pretty disappointed. It is not nearly as nice, the stone is too flat in the ring, and it turned my finger green within a few hours of wear. Sterling silver isn't supposed to do that. I don't think I will be purchasing any more items from this seller."
5,Great toy,"This is such a good toy. I never knew a toy truck could have such ""personality"". It plays a song and ""dances"" to it, lights flashing and everything. My almost 2 and 4 year old FLIP every time they press that button, yelling and jumping with happiness. My little one also thinks it is HYSTERICAL that he can push the ""come back at you"" button and the truck will drive forward 4 feet, then reverse right back to him. Another reason this is an awesome toy is because it got left outside in the rain for two days and still worked after it dried out. I highly reccomend this for 18 mo - 6 yr olds."
3,nice little book,"this was nto as helpful as i wanted it lack lot i of info. you think be in it ""water is what we are made of and good water is what we need to drink"". yes i know that already gee tell em something i dont know. you get the ide aany way"
3,A Quick Study,"I have been researching and writing about water for over 40 years, and have owned and operated a state-certified water testing laboratory for 14 years. As a result, I have over 600 water books in my private library. Therefore, when I see a quick-study book float to the surface - such as this one - I hope for the best. This book offers practical information, albeit relatively superficial. I believe that the layperson will also find it useful to read ""The Drinking Water Book"" (Second Edition) by Colin Ingram, which offers excellent, up-to-date information about our drinking water."
3,The Stuff of Life,"For the last 15 years, I have expended a large amount of personal time searching for the healthiest foods on our planet and the best form of water to drink.I have switched from spring to reverse osmosis to distilled to structured and have always been undecided about ionizing water.The chapter on ""The Importance of Water on Human Health"" is worth everyone's time to read. From when to drink to how much to how much is too much water, this topic is a good nudge for all who have forgotten the simple necessity of drinking enough water and the right water.For readers who seriously are considering which form of water they believe will benefit them most fully, this book is certainly worth the time reading.With my doctorate in Naturopathy, I can tell you the opinions are myriad as to which water is the most beneficial water to drink. I also appreciated Mr Meyerowitz's brevity and keeping his book a quick read for everyone."
3,Not the best,"Here's the summary: drink a lot of clean water.The first half goes into details about why, and it's good to motivate you to drink more water, but that's about it.The second half is about water filters and bottled water and so forth. If you want information on how to get clean water, there's a much better book:The Drinking Water Book: How to Eliminate the Most Harmful Toxins from Your Water. It was much more valuable to me in selecting a water filter."
4,Very helpfull for first timers.....,"I thought this book was very helpfull for us, we had our first litter of puppies and reading this book it helped me to see and know what might happen when the puppies come...and the materical I might need for the birthing . Everything went well .."
5,Great Book for Novice Breeder!,"As a somewhat nervous potential dog breeder, I ordered a few books to research the subject. This book is by far the best of the lot!It doesn't cover genetics, pedigrees, etc., you will need other resources for that. But it does an excellent job of focusing on the pregnant mother, whelping and the rearing of puppies to several weeks of age.I especially like the section on newborn and problem puppies, and the practical advice on when it is time to ""let go"" of an obvious dying pup.After reading this book, I am much more confident about the progression of events in the whelping (both normal and problems) and highly recommend it to others."
5,The Whelping and Rearing of Puppies: A Complete and Practical Guide,Received super fast and in great condition.
4,not the old-fashion teflon,"I was leery in the beginning, but the 11-inch griddle works great when making omelets, not much oil is needed and to my surprise, no sticking! The other 2 skillets, 8-inch & 9-inch, were a bit small, wish they were 9 and 10-inch ones."
2,Farber ware cooking set,"I only used the frying pan like maybe 5 times, and it has already started to rust, and pieces have chipped off the pan. I certainly won't recommend this product to anyone else."
2,Faberware Pans - not great,I was disappointed about how light and not heavy duty like my other Faberware pans are. They just dont stand up like my other pieces and things still stick to the pans.
2,Non-stick to Stick to Quick,"We've only used and washed these pans a few times and found that the non-stick surface loses it's non-stickiness very quickly...The price was very low, but unfortunately, it looks like the quality is too..."
5,Great value.,"Use pans for cooking eggs and cheesy items without troublesome cleanup.Steaks with sugary marinades clean up quickly.Excellent bargain, purchased with 6-piece bakeware set for $25 delivered."
4,good movie,its funny its better then the first two movies. if u watched dorm daze 1 and 2. u will love this one
2,"A few laughs yes, but only a few","Though it says ""from the creators of Dorm Daze 1 & 2"", Transylmania is better than either, albeit not by a whole lot. This fairly raunchy comedy follows a group of high school students on a trip to Romania, only to run afoul of vampires and other paranormal oddities. Cases of mistaken identity, a hunchbacked girl and her nefarious midget father, and a sexy vampire hunter are the orders of the day here, and while there are a few laughs to be had, they are sadly too few and far between. Still, there are enough visual gags, hot babes, and James DeBello to hold your attention, but for the most part, Transylmania doesn't offer anything you haven't seen or laughed at plenty of times before."
3,Creative and Silly,"I've got to admit that this film was so corny and creative it was quite entertaining. If you take it with a grain of salt, you'll love it. If you attempt to take it seriously, you're watching the wrong flick. It's a little gross and shouldn't be viewed by the young ones, but I was impressed with the overall presentation. The one aspect I didn't go along with was the beautiful young hunchback lady. I don't know why the guy was repulsed by her. Let's be honest...she was/is hot! I'll leave it at that! If you want mindless candy, this one's for you! Enjoy!"
5,Hysterical for what it is,"It's not meant to win an Oscar. It is however one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while and a sure fire bet for a quick and easy laugh on those days that you need a pick-me-up. I don't understand all the negative reviews. The movie never pretends to be anything that what it is: a stupid, feel good comedy. Give it a chance. Given some of the stupid stuff people think is funny these days, I am suprised this was as poorly reviewed as it was."
1,a ghastly attempt at horror movie parody,"*1/2If studios could do product recalls, the witless and inept ""Transylmania"" would be high on the list of returnable merchandise. This truly pathetic stab at horror movie comedy involves a group of brainless college students from America who enroll in a summer school session held in a vampire-infested castle in Romania.The incoherent storyline is matched by the amateurish acting and low-grade humor, which frequently reaches back - badly - to old Marx Brothers and ""I Love Lucy"" routines for laughs.Actually, the movie has seemingly saved all its clever and funny parts for an epilogue that runs all of six minutes. If the other ninety had been half as good, we might have had something here. But, any way you slice it, ""True Blood"" this ain't."
2,Transylmania - DVD,"Directed by: David Hillenbrand and Scott HillenbrandStarring: Patrick Cavanaugh, James DeBelloRunning time: 92 min. Unrated - 2009How would one describe the movie ""Transylmania""? It feels like a cross between ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and one of the many bad sequels to ""American Pie."" A group of students go to Romania to study abroad as vampire chaos ensues. This movie had its moments as the stoner characters were pretty funny but that's about it. The movie had a lot going on but nothing of any real substance, even for film of this genre.Don't bother."
1,Under Funny,"It is not a film i'd watch again. I realize that it is a horror spoof, but I didn't find anything funny about it. The premise is decent enough and the acting was fine, I just didn't think it was humorous in any way shape or form."
1,Way Over the Top!,"As a regualar retreatant, I began reading this book with great anticipation. I enjoyed parts, but soon the author seemed to leave her spiritual pathway and take an overly self-involved direction. When she decided to quit interacting verbally with her dog and then later made the decision to quit going to Eucharist, she completely lost me. With so many sincerely written books on solitude, silence and meditation, this book is an unnecessary addition to anyone's collection."
2,HEADS UP!,"This is not the movie ""The Battle of the Bulge"" with Henry Fonda. Apparently the movie is not available on DVD at this time..bummer!"
4,You can feel the bitter cold while watching this video,"One of the best documentaries made on the Battle of the Bulge. Historic camera footage is matched with contemporary views of the same (or similar) sites. Numerous interviews with the veterans who were actually there. The video is also packed with information about the state of the US Army before, during, and after the battle. This video is best viewed by students of this great battle and by those who know nothing at all about the last gasp Ardennes Offensive. For everyone else, the documentary could be a bit confusing as the film drifts from straight chronological event descriptions and there are few maps offerred. Available in both VHS and CD, this is the movie to get if you want the true story of the Battle of the Bulge."
3,Good Compressor with Flaw,"This is , in general, a well-designed compressor and is better built than most of these. The reason for the 3 stars is the nozzle clamp is flawed. It has to clamp on in an exact location or it will leak air which is why it takes so long to pump air in most of the time. The ""sweet spot"" will vary from one nozzle to the next. Not a good thing to work with if you're are in an emergency."
4,It sure works but a little slower,"This is a good accessory to keep the car tires properly inflated. I have couple of cars and a bike. I bought this to keep the tires properly inflated from time to time. It works well.The only hassle is it is slow. It needs 3-4 mins to inflate from 26-30 for my car. Imagine if you have to inflate 4 tires, it would take about 15 mins. But i think this is still worth it just for maintenance purposes. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to maintain tire inflation, especially if you have multiple cars. Its a hassle to go to a gas station for air and most of the time the air pumps are out of service."
5,Powerful and long cord to reach other cars.,"I have used the new compressor on the tires of my bicyle and tractor lawn mower tires. The longer cord from the ""ligher"" affords me to do more things with it."
1,The power plug will get stuck and potentially ruin your AC outlet,Buyer aware!!: It works but the power plug got stuck and I had to shatter the front piece to get it out. It could damage your fuse too. My car is Honda Accord LX2003
1,belt broke after 1 day,"the machine appears well built and started right away. The assembly was hindered by a lack of reasonable instructions. The belt broke after one day of use. I ordered two new belts from swisher. they readily accepted the order and charged my credit card however, the order has been impossible to track. i sent 6 emails and no response. i tried calling 4 times and was put on automatic hold each time for over 30 minutes each time with no answer. The customer service is horrible. actually the term ""swisher customer service"" is an oxymoron. there is no service. I also wrote for information on how to install the belt - it looks like you must remove the engine. I hesitated buying this machine and was going to buy a tow behind Dr (although more expense). well i should have followed my instincts."
2,Pinkish and light weight,"This paper holder consists of a pinkish red color much closer to the color of copper than oil rubbed bronze. Actually it's closer to the pinkish side than red, and the color is noticeably different when near other ""oil rubbed bronze"" accessories such as door knobs and faucets other than Danze products. Danze faucets have a superior feel to them for the most part, but this product has a light weight feel (obviously not brass). They are reasonable in price, and you get what you pay for with these, an inexpensive product that doesn't fit well with other accessories with oil rubbed finish. I returned this and a towel bar for a quick refund."
2,Warm but wet,"These socks are warm and comfy when dry, but this polypro absorbs water like crazy. As soon as the top of the sock gets wet, it instantly wicks moisture all the way down to the toes. Not optimal in damp conditions."
1,Never answers my question,"If keeping one's race ""pure"" is so important, as Duke makes it out to be, then what is to be done about the inevitable rise of genetic disorders? Any biologist worth his/her salt can point out, with research that trumps all of Duke's eugenic nonsense, that breeding within one's ""own race"" dramatically heightens the risk of genetic disorders in the next generation. Ironically, a tragic example is provided by the Jews, whose population must now deal with the horrors of Tay-Sachs syndrome, truly a fate worse than death. Interestingly enough, Jews who breed with a non-Hebrew partner effectively remove the danger of Tay-Sachs, and a whole host of other disorders to boot. Similar situations hold true for every other ethnicity on the planet. David Duke may not want humans to ""spread their seeds around."" But Nature evidently does."
1,"With supporters like this, he doesn't need enemies","Take a good look at the what some of the people who gave this book 5 stars have said: ""THIS BOOK MUST NOT BE STIFFLED"" says the guy from Idaho. Indeed. No stiffling, then. And then Mike Denison from Texas says, in all seriousness, that it's the best book ever, a work of genius. He should know: as he says himself, ""(keep in mind I HATE READING!) Usually I will read a few pages of a book, then struggle to finish the chapter, close the book and do something else. I can't stand reading, this is the first book I've ever read so easily that I didn't even want to put it down.""Well, there you go. Duke must be right --- after all, some guy who has trouble reading more than a few pages of text thinks he's a genius.Don't buy this nonsense."
1,I gave him a chance,"While flipping through the channels I ran across the CNN/Books interview with Duke and I wanted to hear what he had to say regarding his new book. I know of Duke's past and have watch the media always display him in his Klan outfit but so figured I give him a chance. My Opinion...What trash. He is talking the same crap that I've heard from him is the past. Duke can try and intellectualize his racism but people can see through the improved vocabulary, the suit, tie and nose job. What a waste of air time."
2,"Well-documented, but boring","Duke presents facts that cannot be ignored. However, the book tends to take on a life of it's own. Simply, I wasn't able to finish it. Is Duke a racist? I have no idea."
1,Proud American,"This book is silly! I decided to read this only to see, as Jim Rohn says how horrible a person can become. My wife and I are proud Americans who happen to be black. Amazingly, my wife graduated #1 with a 4.0/4.0 scale from a school that was 98% white. She has a Math degree from an Ivy League University! I have a college degree and finished with honors. Now, based on Dukes ""Theories,"" this shouldn't be! The minority class in this country is too big and powerful for any movement of this kind to be successful. WAKE UP AND STOP DREAMING."
5,An Autobiography with an Engaging Presentation of Research,"MY AWAKENING is a captivating book that exemplifies how a student is to do a research [theme] paper. Dr. Duke used autobiography to structure his awakening that was thoroughly researched, cross-checked and referenced. His writing engages and draws you deeper into each of two topics using the facts and evidence; while his multiple sourced examples test the credibility of his sources. Here you will see how racial differences evolve in geographically separated populations; and you will see how influential zionist leaders can maintain their culture of excusiveness while directing others to multiculturalism. The author studied, awoke and was surprised by the discoveries."
5,Best book of the year,"As the year comes to its end, I can think of the books I read during this period. And Duke's work on society and race is by far the best book I read this year. This is a very well written book, sound. And the book that changed most my ideas, thus influenced me most. I am tempted to reuse a sentence of a previous reviewer, and turn it into: not all books are created equal! This is a book that I can recommend to anyone who thinks a bit."
5,One of the best researched books I have read in a long time,"David Dukes book is a must read for anyone that has concern for this country.My Awakening is the perfect title for this book.Maybe it should be called YOUR Awakening.It well wake up a spirit of patriotism so many of us have been missing in our lives.I know there are some who would disagree with me and they are those who havn't read the book,but David Duke belongs in the history books along side Ben Franklin and Thomas Paign.The book starts a little slow but builds with research and scientific facts that make the book hard to put down.David Duke is one great American."
5,"Great book, could'nt put it down. Let God sort them out!","Mr. Duke explains what has happened in this wonderful country of ours over the past few years. He explains the truth behind the difference of races phycially & logically. The Jewish conspiracy is finnally explained and shown what their true goal is in the New World Order. He explains the hardship this kid went through because he felt a certain way that others could'nt understand. Logic is so simple yet those who cont. to take everything their told as gold will not survive as free people. Only those who understand the true nature of the beast, can confront him and destroy him. Read the book, you won't ever forget it!"
3,Interesting,"A well-written,interesting account of the development of racial attitudes and relations in the US. The author clearly has a slant against blacks and jews, but this is a good read if you want a view of US society that you'll never see in the mainstream press. I can't say that I agree with all his opinions, but he raises some valid points. He makes himself an easy target by taking shots at the jewish domination of most of our society, but let's face facts... he's right. Look at any media source, finance source, the professions,etc. They tend to control key areas of American society. I wish he spent a bit more time on the abosolute garbage being fobbed on our society by tv/movies/music; that's where real accountability should begin. An interesting book, but I can't say I agree with all of it."
3,Too much data,"I am a admirer of David Duke's since he is able to represent Anglo interests without conveying hate. He is the hispanic man's Ceasar Chavez or the black man's Jesse Jackson. He has fought for equality for all since the 60's. This book, however, is a boring compilation of outdated authors and facts that gets bogged down in minute scientific details about IQ and ability. This is probably not necessary and has been written several times before. It almosts states that he needs to scientifically prove segregation rather than explain it based on ""gut"" feeling. Lets face it, when I walk through Watts or East LA, I don't like it. I don't need science to explain why I don't like these neighborhoods or most of the people who live there. I just don't. Anyway, could be better, huge fan!"
5,The Most Important Book Of The 21st Century!,"When I finished reading MY AWAKENING, I knew I'd just witnessed the birth of a movement. If enough White people read this, it WILL bring on a revolution! I agree with the other reviewers who feel this book was a life-changing experience for them. This book moved me like no other I've ever read. I now freely loan out my autographed copy to friends who need to know the extent the mainstream media has been lying to them. I'm planning to buy more copies to donate to my local library. That's how strongly I feel this message must get out. If you are European-American and care about the future your children will have to face, READ THIS BOOK!"
5,The curtain of media deception is finally cut to shreds.,"With surgical precision, Mr. Duke has cut the current media-created curtain of deception to shreds. As I read each page and marveled at the sheer logic, I felt a troublesome burden being lifted from both my shoulders and my mind. The weight of all the lies that I had been fed over the years was finally being pulled off of me, one page at a time. Mr. Duke may very well be this country's last chance for a philosopher and leader that can deliver the recovery and salvation that all true Americans long for. If Mr. Duke's message is not heeded, I have nothing left to believe but that this great nation, with all of its promise and history, is truly doomed. I recommend this book HIGHLY to any person with the courage to face the most challenging obstacle of all: TRUTH."
4,A book filled with truth.,"I'm a biology teacher and I've been studying these issues for years. Issues such as racial differences, eugenics, darwinism and the works of Sir Francis Galton, etc. and I must say that the truth may hurt, but it is, nevertheless, the truth. By reading these reviews, one can see who the real enemies of the white race are. The guy who criticized him about the ""talmud"" read one chapter of the book and gave it one star. How can you judge an entire book by reading one chapter?"
5,woo,"i first saw david at borders not too long ago, and i fell in love with him ... and kingdom come and go is the perfect reminder of that great accoustic evening. I still think This Euphoria is my all time favorite of his, but this one is wonderful in its own almost-unfinished-like way."
4,Not Half Bad,"I managed to annoy everyone at work, Best Buy, by buying this cd after we were forced to listen to THIS EUPHORIA 10 times a day. If you liked that cd for that cd only then stay away from this one. If you like Garza then get it. It is rather different from his other album that I am familiar with"
4,Love this book!,RPE does not disappoint. I actually cried while listening to this (which doesn't mean a lot because I cry at Hallmark commercials. It wasn't my favorite book of his but excellent!
3,Read like a chic flick...,"This was an entertaining, quick read, and I did want to know what would happen next. Some of the details got a little boring and I found myself skipping some of them which I don't normally do. Would be a good beach/vacation read."
2,THE SUNFLOWER,"the story was supposed to be a love story, but i did not find it at all realistic. not realistic and not romantic. sorry. i'd rather have read evan's THE CHRISTMAS BOX or THE LOCKET a second time. those were both very good books."
5,Very good,"The Bbook was in very good condition and it was shipped in the time allowed. Thank you, it was a great read."
5,Amazing!,"An easy and exciting read. Well worth having in your library. I will read it more than once. Love, responsibility, real emotion, selflessness and charity are all words I use to describe it. Great story line and is so mind blowing to think it is a true story!"
3,eh...,"I usually love RPE, and this was an enjoyable book to read, however, the charactors lacked the depth in both personality and story line to be believable. I like to feel like I know the charactors and can relate to their broken hearts, or whatever central crisis always seems to be neccessary to write about a romance. But I never got warm fuzzies. This was supposed to be a love story and I can't find the falling in love part. I didn't feel these two people were meant for each other the way ""a great love story"" would.That being said, Paul Cooks diary is really what I would like to read. I feel like the glimpses are more telling than the filling. I won't quit reading RPE and I still recommend his books but I hope in his next book the story is more important than the message."
3,Sunny cause ... dull read,"Richard Paul Evans is one of my favorite authors. I've read every one of his novels and always look forward to his next book. I was a little late in getting ""The Sunflower,"" instead reading ""Finding Noel"" and ""The Gift"" first--both were excellent! Although ""The Sunflower"" promotes a wonderful cause and is basically a heartwarming story, in my opinion it was dull reading. There was way too much trite, chatty ""who cares"" dialogue that didn't add to the story and it took endless pages to get to the point. I never do this, but I finally skipped to the last quarter of the book to see if there was any more excitement. And, yes the last part was better and although a bit predictable, had a nice ending. NOTE: Actually I own the hardback but not the large print edition."
3,The sunflower,Took more a long time to get into it others have been much easier to. Get into the story. Looking forward to the last bok in the walk.
3,Average- not believable in parts...,I've live with and around alcoholics and find it hard to believe that he never slips up...also the writer is very wordy...should have been edited down a bit...too many adjectives! The story is a good one but could have been better.
4,Nice,A new and defiance view. Puts the subject on earth. Our brain moves forward and reach a new status of knowledge. Gives an interesting focus on a subject that has been dark for ages. Worth reading it
4,Only an overview,"This is not a comprehensive study of ethics and the human brain, but it is an interesting overview.There is apparently a hard wired ethical part of the brain. World wide, despite cultural differences, there is widespread unanimity on what is ethical. The cultural differences arise in our *interpretations* of the choices we make. (Oddly, my interpretation of Genesis came to the same conclusion years ago: mankind's sense of good and evil arose before religion.) Belief systems come from the interpreter part of the brain that tries to bring together data into a coherent whole.My thought on this topic is that this commonality of ethics could (and should) be used to bring the human race together. I hope scientists work on that aspect of brain studies.This book is only one of many, but it is one of the simplest and therefore more accessible to those of us who are non scientists."
2,A Disappointment,"Although the information inside is decent, I expected more arresting writing and ideas. For a more interesting discussion of science and morality, read The Science of Good and Evil by Michael Shermer."
2,So disappointing,"Michael Gazzaniga is a pioneer in the field of cognitive neuroscience, but that does not make this book good. Tom Wolfe calls the book ""provocative,"" but he must be easily provoked given the book's vapid presentation of what ought to be fascinating topics. I agree with Wolfe that the book is ""highly readable,"" but that is only because the writing to so insipid."
5,Wonderful!,This book was amazing...it really made you think a lot. I would recommend that you have some knowledge of brain anatomy before reading this book though...if you are a medical person I highly recommend this book! Happy reading!
4,Gerry's first solo album.,"Gerry Rafferty had just released ""City To City"" in 1977 and they re-issued his very first solo album ""Can I Have My Money Back"" in 1971. I bought this, didn't know really anything about it, but it sure goes to show you Gerry Rafferty was a great artist. ""Money"", is a solid release for the then 24 year old. This album kind of had the sound of Stealers Wheel the group he formed with Joe Egan in 1972. On this release you get some great songs in, ""New Street Blues"", ""Mr. Universe"", the title track, the skiffle of ""Mary Skeffington"", ""Sign On The Dotted Line"", a musician signing his life away in the crooked music business and ""Don't Count Me Out"". 40 years have passed since its release and now Gerry has passed. R.I.P. Gerry, you were a great artist!"
2,Leather?,"Although the description says that these cases are leather, I wouldn't want to put a match near them, they would probably melt. I bought several for presents and am not impressed."
1,I've owned 2 Bulova Watches,"My first lasted 8 years in every environment. I loved it! Until my son took a hammer to it.So I bought the watch above. No doubt this is a pretty watch, but I brought it in the pool once and its had water in it ever since. The interior is ruined.I thought it was just condensation but theres clearly a problem with it.Resist up to 100 meters huh. They need to take Marine out of the name."
5,My Husband Loved It,"I bought this for my husband a little over a year ago. He loves it and wears it all the time. We recently put a ""lifetime"" battery in it as the factory one died. All in all it was a great buy."
3,History and Religion of Israel,I am replacing a book which I studied as a divinity student way back in 1961. It is book that I need to support my study of the Bible.
3,Nothing special,"I didn't find anything too exciting about this book. Maybe it was the colors or the characters, but I just found it to be very dull. I have already read enough graphic novels to know about the ""teen experience"". This book might be good for a teenager, but for an adult it gave me a ""done that been there"" feeling. The book isn't bad but just too normal and ordinary."
2,Disappointing and Over Produced,"There was not much to impress on this album. If you're a Rafferty fan, then this should be the last album to buy in your research or listening enjoyment on the musician. Track after track is rife with over production traits like heavy drum machines, and keyboard/synthesizer riffs. The only standout was the hard rocker ""Does He Know What He's Taken On"" A solid song is ""The Light of Love"" but that's only because it's a soft tune sans the hard over-bearing drum machine. Throughout the album are the typical pessimistic views of the rock industry as a whole. This is especially clear on the opening track ""Time's Caught Up On You"". The low price on the album is the best thing about the work, so if you do choose to get this one, just chalk the seven dollar loss up to a venture."
2,Disappointing swan song,"I have listened to this album a half dozen times and there is just nothing here that matches anything on ""Sleepwalking"" or ""North and South"". Too many of the songs are simply overproduced. And after listening to this album again, I can't for the life of me remember the tunes from any of the songs. The one exception is ""Don't Speak of My Heart"". But again, this barely makes an impression. Too bad. Now that's he's gone, we'll never have a chance to hear anything new from a great songwriter and singer. So, instead of buying this grade ""C"" album, put on ""City to City"" or ""Sleepwalking"" or ""North and South"" (my personal favorite as a solid album of Rafferty songs) and hear the man at his best. RIP, Gerry, and thanks for the tunes."
5,Fate for kids,"The kids love this... My kids, myself, and my hubby play this all the time. We try to do better then the person before. Its easy to learn and the kids learn with the game as it progresses to higher levels."
3,Addictive,"This game is for gamers have a lot of time on their hands. It is very time consuming due to the amount of levels that you have to complete, and it's hard to leave. Only buy this if you've got the time to play it."
4,Better Check for it to work.....,"This game is VERY fun adn entertaining. If you get a demo of it on your new computer like I did, DONT TURN IT OFF. You'll want to play for hours, trying to squeeze every bit of fun out of the demo. I had a very slight lag issue, but only because my processor is pretty wimpy. It was annoying how your pet would auto attack any enemy it came remotly close to, but luckily, my pet was always stronger and faster, so is wasnt a problem. It's pretty cool how every player gets a different 'major' boss to face (mine was some large ice giant). But nevertheless, its an extremely fun game. One last downside; when I bought this game directly from Wild Tanget, I couldn't unlock it because I have no Internet for my laptop. Hopefully, this version will let you play without internet.A good game that will hold your attention until Borderlands for Xbox 360 arrives in late 2008."
3,vista problem,"i couldn't get this game to load on my vista 64 bit computer- i did get to play it as a free demo and it worked fine. the game is pretty good and the graphics were great , i just wished i could have got it to work on my computer, beware of vista 64 bit compatability issues whenever you purchase any newer games. if you can get it to load i definatly recommend this game- please excuse my spelling errors i am not the greatest speller on the planet."
4,meet your fate....,"Fate, is a very well made game.which has a couple flawes,As well as highlights.highlights are the dificiulty which makes the game less likely to become boreing but this also causes alot of frustration.another highlight is the fact this game consists of other game chateristics that many people love, such as many weapons and armour and fishing which allows to catch useful items as for the bad thing ill save those 4 another review."
4,Great Item,I jus ordered this item for my cousin for her birthday..it came fast and in great condition..only thign I saw wrong it was..It came in a simple paper slip. no game book or anythingBut it came with the game box so thats great :)all in all 4 out of 5 :)
5,Great timewaster,"This game is a great little timewaster.Modeled on Diablo, and on Nethack before it, you're an adventurer who, with his trusty dog, will crawl through randomly generated dungeon levels, collecting randomly generated treasure.Nice way to waste some time.The Mac port has a few bugs with sound, but no bugs that interfere with gameplay."
2,Can you say repetetive?,"Alright, the game started out really fun and interesting, but after realizing that the levels to the dungeons were so numerous, I got peeved with it. I ended up keeping up with the game long enough to beat it, which wasn't that difficult and anti-climatic. The whole pet sidekick was cool at first, but the fact that you can transform your pet into the strongest form the game has to offer within the first 15 minutes was a letdown as well, regardless of leveling. I simply couldn't believe that a game as fun as this would turn out to be so repetitive. That's why I gave it 2 stars.If you like the idea of unending dungeons without any new kind of material throughout the game, go ahead and buy it and enjoy it while your patience lasts, but don't buy a sequel."
3,It's okay...,"I love the quests and the pets and fishing, but it has very little plot. I have the free trial on my computer, but I don't think it's worth the price to buy it. Dunno. My brother likes the game, but he's a kid. So if you're a kid (or are planning on buying it for a kid) maybe it'll be enjoyed, but for teens and adults... not so much. I would have liked it more if it had a better plot..."
2,Looks good but isn't built well,This product was a big disappointment! I bought it for my son for Christmas last year and it fell apart right away. He loved the way it looked but got very frustrated because it wouldn't stay together. Overall a very disappointing purchase.
2,"A very long ""rant""","I was initially engrossed while reading about the history of the Dershowitz family and their lives in Brooklyn. As the book progressed, it was more like a very long ""rant"" about anti-Semitism, and the miserable plight of American Jews. As an American Jew living in the rural western US, I cannot relate to the discrimination described and felt by the author. As with any religion outside the mainstream of the popular culture, Jews will always be considered as ""different"". We set ourselves apart from others by our values, moral beliefs, and our observances."
1,At least the title is honest,"Mr. Chutzpah is a Harvard Law professor. Called on his attributing the Joan Peters' awful neologism ""turnspeak"" to Orwell Mr. Chutzpah publicly attributed it to Huxley. The less said about the (lack of) erudition of Harvard Law professors the better it seems.Dean Elena Kagan of Harvard, a tireless defender of Mr. Chutzpah, who seems to have never walked when she could crawl instead, may wish to revise Harvard advertising to put in disclaimers with respect to the law school: that Harvard's general reputation notwithstanding, she makes no assurances as to the quality of present faculty like Mr. Chutzpah.Mr. Chutzpah, when he is not defending pornographers and the like of O.J. Simpson, works with his lawyers at Cravath, Swain and Moore to suppress books critical of him and his shoddy ""scholarship"". Such as Norman G. Finkelstein's devastating takedownBeyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History."
4,"Great press, but the new plunger sucks","The Bodum presses are great. I ordered this one to replace an old one that broke and had long had a damaged handle. I'm glad I kept my old lid/plunger, though, because it seems to work much better than the new one, which seems to have been modified by a committee of corporate lawyers. The new lid is great, but the plunger doesn't seem to go as far down (to prevent me from scalding myself should I be too vigorous, one would presume), and my coffee tasted sour. After a week of that, I switched back to the old lid/plunger--it makes much better coffee."
1,Poor Customer Service,"Bodum does not stand behind its products. I called regarding a product that broke as I was drying it after having rinsed it out for a first time use. Customer service was rude and unhelpful, basically told me that it ""doesn't have a warranty,"" they ""couldn't put a return in the computer,"" and ""the supervisor will tell you the same thing"" (and then she laughs). I would not buy Bodum again. There are plenty of products on the market that have good design and have a decent customer service department."
4,Great spice storage for small spaces,"These stackable spice canisters were just the ticket for storing many different spices in our small 101/2"" wide cabinet. We got a Rubbermaid (tm) turntable to fit into that small space and were able to stack 21 spice containers there for easy access. (6 stacks of 3 outside and one stack in the middle). They hold quite a bit. The only issue I have is that if you want to measure your spices out with a measuring spoon, you have to pry the plastic shaker insert off with a fork. You can't just pop it off or unscrew it. I guess that could be a good thing- they don't easily come off. Be aware that the metal top easily slides off the container. There is no seal of any sort there. I would buy these again."
2,CB,"I purchased this item without carefully reading and it turned out to be larger than I desired. Also, you only get one it is not a set. The quality does not look bad and although I was disappointed, we decided it cost more to send back than it was worth."
4,We love this boat!,"I got this boat for my husband as Father's day's gift. He had hard time to inflate this boat with the pump came with, so we used the autmatic pump we have.Boat itself is good. My husband(170lb), our 3 years old girl(35lb) and me(100lb) fit in it with no problem. Very strong and not so heavy. We love this boat."
2,boat is fine; pump and oars are not,"The pump is so flimsy that the rubbery-plastic parts lost their seal and let all the air escape on the very first use. I sealed them back together with super-glue, but given the cheap construction I'm sure that it will come apart again next time.Worse yet, the oars are quite useless outside a backyard swimming pool. After every stroke they must be re-tightened to stay together (the cheap, plastic pieces of tubing screw into each other) and within 30 minutes they had cracked.The boat itself, however, is quite nice and works just fine for two adults or three children."
3,nice boat but pump not,"I bought this as a package w/ oars, pump. The pump blew the boat up about 80% then the seam on pump blew out. Pump is not strong enough for normal use. Next time I'll order 1 without the pump and buy a better pump."
4,boat is really awesome with many chambers - seats 2 adults comfortably.,excellent product - boat is really awesome with many chambers - seats 2 adults comfortably. Paddles cracked after 2 outings.Hand pump is virtually useless.
5,good biography about Nasser,This book is good for people who want to start to study the life and work of Gamal Abdel Nasser. It is very readable and good to understand.
3,only for the Shaun fanatic,I purchased this book for a W&G fanatic so the gift will be appreciated. But it is not as charming as I would have hoped from the creators of W&G and all their close associates.
1,TRITE & TIRESOME,"Standard Olsen twins' fare. Just because the girls are cute and can act, it doesn't follow that they can sing. They are children, not lounge lizards. This collection really stinks and anything with Mary-Kate or Ashley on it will sell. These poor kids are used as a money making enterprise.Let them be what they are -- normal, pretty, intelligent girls leading their own lives. Let singing go to those who really can, like Joni Mitchell."
1,OK...........,"Well... you have to admit... the girls are Cute. They can Act. Perfect for almost ANY role. BUT. They just CAN'T sing. Sorry. Try anything else in the world. But not singing, to you, thank you very much. The record sounds like 2 little 4 year olds are singing it in my eyes (or ears). I think you should think twice before buying it."
3,INTERESTING,"WILT HAS MANY OPINIONS AND THOUGHTS. IN THIS BOOK HE EXPRESSES THEM FROM START TO FINISH. I AGREE WITH MANY OF HIS INSIGHTS. HE WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT GUY WHO ENJOYED THE FINE THINGS IN LIFE, CARS, WOMEN, FINE WINES, LARGE HOUSE ETC. WILT LIVED LARGE. THIS IS A NICE READ FOR FANS OF THE GREAT WILT. NICELY PUT TOGETHER."
3,DEFIES MATHEMATICS,"EASY READING AND GOOD INSIGHT AS TO WHAT HAPPENS TO AGING JOCKS. HE COMES ACROSS MOSTLY AS A BRAGGART AND MISSING THE GLORY DAYS; AND THE THING ABOUT 20,000 WOMEN...GIVE ME A BREAK! DID HE EVER HAVE A BAD DAY, LIKE BEING TIRED FROM THE ROAD, STD'S, HAVING A COLD/FLU/INJURIES, OR TAKING IN TOO MANY CALORIES, ETC.? THEN IF YOU MISS A DAY OR TWO, THERE'S A LOT OF CATCH-UP TO KEEP THE NUMBERS STRONG. OVERALL I LIKED THE BOOK AND HAVE TO STATE, ""HE WAS A TERRIFIC, TALENTED BASKETBALL PLAYER."" IT'S NOW TOUGH TO FIND THE BOOK BUT WORTH A LITTLE EFFORT AND TIME."
1,Seven feet of hot air.,"Never have I read a work by such a self-aggrandizing braggart. Like many ex-jocks, Wilt tries to hide his bitterness that he can no longer play pro sports in self-glorification. He portrays himself as larger than life in all aspects, which really gets boring fast in reading this book. It's a good thing Wilt wasn't around in Biblical times, imagine what tall tales we'd find in the Bible if he was!"
2,Tedious,"This book is so tedious, it was a challenge to finish. It was too long on 'will she or won't she' and 'short on PLOT'! The heroine had 'no spine' and the hero was trying to make of the heroine what he hated most in his mother. He wanted to HONOR the fiance he didn't even know and dishonor the woman he loved? Just a very irritating book all together, it strung irritatingly on and on. Be sure to get it from the Library and save your money."
2,...,"This is my last Cathy Maxwell book. I don't know why she likes writing about women who like sex so much. When I read the Marriage Ring, I almost gave up on her. But this book came in a collection of old books I bought and decided to give her one last try. Nope.And that's even the problem this time! This time, the hero was at fault. The things that came out of his mouth; I would have slapped him too.""I love you so much! You make me so happy! You've given my life meaning - what? Marry? Oh no, dear, we could never be married! You'd simply be my mistress! We will be together for always, and after I have sex with my wife to produce a baby, I'll have all the time in the world to spend with you!""Ugh! That's basically what he says throughout the story. No more Cathy Maxwell for me. She writes characters like they're modern-day."
3,"satisying love scenes, frustrating characterzations","this is my second Cathy Maxwell book. The author is quite talented and this book was very enjoyable. My only problem with it was the hero, Tony. His mantra of ""I can't live without you, but I cannot marry you"" got a bit tedious. Of course, being a romance, all works out in the end-but I still wanted to throttle the male lead-he was a bit ""too stupid to live"" at times:)The love scenes are highly charged-probably out of place in a regency-but darn good anyway.Overall, a fast paced, entertaining read3.5 stars!"
2,My first Cathy Maxwell book was a disappointment.,"The plot line was bizarre, Deb was annoying, and Tony was a whiny baby. Definitely one of the worse historical romances I've read.Thankfully, I gave Cathy Maxwell another chance and read ""Adventures of a Scottish Heiress."" It was much better."
3,I was tempted too.,"I loved this story! It was really different, it just got a bit unbelievable at the end. But entertaining; a quick read. I have read better books, therefore, I couldn't give it 5 stars."
2,Mediocre album from anything but a mediocre rapper,"This album was highly anticipated on the west by the streets but when it dropped it proved to be a disappointment. From a lesser caliber of artist this would have been a great album, but true fans of W.C. know his capabilities and this effort just didnt measure up. Im not sayin this is unlistenable, far from it. The whole album is playable, if only a couple of times. It becomes monotonous and predictable almost immediately. If u just want good music then this is for u, but if u want something ground breaking u will have to look else where for the moment.I still luv W.C., dont get it twisted."
1,Deff not the NEXT 10,"It should not be labeled the Next 10, more like the FIRST Prehistoric 10. Did our presidents take these tests??? There are question types in here that are no longer apart of the LSAT, to study this I would have to go back and research how to answer old questions in preparation for a new test...this book should be free."
2,"Tests are old and bit outdated, the questions have changed quite a bit since this book","Good for practice, I suppose. It helped me before I took the LSAT in Feb but there are plenty of other free resources you can find out there. Just use google.The tests in this book are old, the LSAT has changed a lot in the last 5 years. This book doesn't give you any explanations for the answers, so in that way it can be frustrating. Just taking the test over and over is good for you to learn how to get your time down but when you are getting the same 4-5 problems wrong every section you want to know why and what you can do better. Look elsewhere for your study materials."
4,Perfect just for one thing...,"I agree with all the other reviews... It makes sense to have actual LSAT tests to study from, but the only thing that I can say the would stop me from giving it a perfect rating is the fact that they just give you the answer key without giving you an explanation on how they derived the answer. Most times you should be able to see what you did wrong but knowing why you got something wrong would be much easier if they provided written explanations for their answers..."
2,Notes scrawled all over,"I purchased this book, which stated that it was in an acceptable condition, with some notes, highlighting, and frayed edges etc. About half of the book was not marked , the other half that was marked had notes scrawled all over the pages, in blue and black ink pen. On certain pages, there were lines crossed over an over throughout certain lines of the text, and the huge writings in blue and black ink covered the text as well. I think this should have been stated clearly, I would not have made this purchase had I known that the notes and highlighting could dominate the text."
4,Lots of practice tests,"I have not yet taken the LSAT, I've actually gone on a different path, but I did purchase this book when I was considering Law School and the book has a lot of practice tests in it which are very helpful."
2,Next 10 Actual LSAT,The book was marked up too much. All the answers to the questions were marked which posed a problem for me.
4,Exactly what it describes,It is 10 LSAT tests with answer sheets. It is exactly what it describes. Only has 4 sections per tesat whereas the real LSAT has 5. But just double up when practicing.
4,THE LATEST and the MOST REPRESENTATIVE LSATs,"In a fit of compulsiveness, I bought all three of the Law School Admission Council's ""10 AO LSAT"" books. (The first is ""10 AO LSATS"", followed by ""10 More AO LSATs"" and now this, ""10 Next AO LSATs.""). All three books contain offcially released, actual LSATs. However, if only buying one, I would say that this is the best choice. The tests are newer; moreover, it seems to me that the ""games and ""logic"" sections of the current LSAT, though ostensibly the same as when first introduced in 1994, have been made slightly easier. If you just read the first book, you may be needlessly scared and discouraged. With this book and to a lesser extent the second book, you will at least not have unjustified anxiety. This is still a TOUGH test, but but no longer quite the nightmare it was back in the mid 90s."
5,Perfect,"Seriously, if you are purchasing any book that isn't the official LSAT prep test series you are selling yourself short. They do not approximate the type of questions that you are going to see on a real LSAT.These books, on the other hand, are perfect for prepping for the LSAT. There is nothing like the real thing."
5,Good practice book,This book is everything it claims to be. Ten practice tests that make you more familiar with the LSAT. I would recommend this book to anyone taking the LSAT.
1,I'm sorry. I agree with the other dissatisfied customers.,"This has got to be the worst health ever self-published. Yes, those are strong words, but when there are so many informative guides out there, why would you waste time with this joke of a guide? This author's two biggest health tips are .... are you listening? Lemons and enemas. Lemons and enemas. Are you kidding me? I could over look the many typos and graamar errors, but to rec lemons and enemas, I'm sorry that is just awful. Now I see why this book was self-published, every major publisher took one look and couldn't stop laughing. My advice, which is better than anything this book will offer is to avoid it at all cost. If you're desperate there are many great guides on the best-sellers lists. Which by the way is where I discovered this book. It was recommended in many, many reviews. Makes ya think who is doing the recommending? Hmmmm. Final word: Stay way!!"
5,Exceptional methods for healthy living.,This book is written by a Russian. A lot of their research is more advanced than ours in some areas.This book sort of reads like a shamanic code to living. The reviewer that says he needs scientific proof? You won't get any of that from any shaman either. Go sit in the village. And gee. We have seen supposed health studies in the US that were totally wrong. I will stick with the OLD WIVES TALE methods which these are similar to. I was overwhelmed with the ideas he presented since there were so many. WHERE should I start. I don;t know. Everything in me is probably clogged. Our countries' great medical procedures work well for severe and problematic issues. General health here is abysmal. This book will help with that.
4,"Neither good, neither bad","I bought this book a month or so ago, and firstly, I was quite impressed by a reasonably fast delivery from States to the UK.This book is NOT 100% scientifically proven health advice, yet some of the recommendations do make sense. I've picked out some advice that I like/suits my lifestyle (avoiding red meat/milk) and ignore the rest (like drinking structured water or doing enemas and similar). I'm rather new to all this healthy lifestyle and dieting books/advice etc., as I'm only 28 years old and never had any serious health problems despite of a bit of fatigue now and then, though with the years passing by I am sure a healthier lifestyle/diet (or a bit of an effort) won't do any harm to anyone. Maybe there are better similar books, but I've picked this one up and I am satisfied with my choice and Amazon service.Regards,Daiva"
5,An oldie but a goodie,I first bought this tape in the early 1980's and had since lost it. It was really good to hear it again.
4,good but to expensive,they wok good puppy doesnt even know they are on. However i paid $18 on this site and then found it for 2.95 on several others!
2,3 out of 14,"After the first 2 songs ('I am the walrus', and 'I can see for miles') I thought this was going to be agreat CD, but I thought it only had one other very good cover song on the remaining of the album ('Talking about the good times'). 'Summer in the city' was OK, 'Find the cost of freedom' was great but far to short (1:04). The rest was very disapointing to me. I didn't think it was posible to ruin the song 'Blue collar man' but I guess I was rong."
2,POINTLESS COVERS ALBUM,"There are two reasons to do a covers album:first,if you are a currently hot artist who wants to introduce your audience to the people and songs that influenced you,and secondly,if you are going to take these songs and go a different direction than the original versions and make them your own.Sadly,neither reason applies here-Styx has been past its expiration date for awhile and the new versions are largely faithful and inferior to the originals.They lack a distinctive sound and vocalist.Maybe if they had a young Joe Cocker at the mike and Jeff Beck on guitar...but that would be a much better band.But if someone like Green Day wants to try this,you have my blessing."
1,"""Big Disappointment Theory""","Being a looong time Styx fan and very dedicated I think I have the right to say I didn't think I could possibly be any more disappointed than I was when ""Cyclorama"" was released, but I am. The only song that has a chance on this ""tribute"" album is ""Can't Find My Way Home"" It has nothing to do with the absence of Dennis DeYoung, I certainly don't miss the power ballads, but I think it's time to put this band out of it's misery, the only thing keeping this band afloat is the fact that they are still one of the greatest live bands ever, but obviously they are having trouble writing new material, maybe it's time to call it quits while they still have a little dignity left, if any."
2,Uneven effort from a great band,"This album has its moments. Summer in the City, Locomotive Breath, and Manic Depression are particularly good, but they aren't any better than the originals, in my opinion. Styx does a great job with great songs.However, some of the songs on this album weren't good to begin with, and are even worse when performed by such a good band. ""It Don't Make Sense"" and ""Can't Find My Way Home"" are particularly heinous, but they aren't alone.As a result, I can't listen to the whole album from beginning to end. It is alternately too painful and too boring. I have instead ripped the 5 good tracks on my computer, and simply don't listen to the bad stuff. These tracks (about 18 minutes of music) were not worth the money I paid for the album, especially given that I already had the original versions."
4,covers are covers,"If you buy this CD,know that its a cover album and dont expect more.Its not a ""GREAT"" CD.How could it be? nothings original.They could have added some kind of twists to some of the songs,but instead they played them for the most part like the originals.If you like Styx you should buy it .Its worth the money."
2,Big Bang? Not even a little boom.....,"A a loyal Styx fan, I must say I am very disappointed in this effort. The only positive, is that it showcases the vocal talents of Lawrence Gowan. If you want to hear newer Styx material, Cyclorama is a much better CD.Big Bang is more of a self indulgence for JY & Tommy Shaw.Styx, you can do better!"
3,Correction,"In refence to Mr LeBaron's review: ""For the whiners that think Styx isn't Styx or Journey isn't Journey without the people who deserted the bands close to a decade ago...remember the words of Don Henley: get over it!"", Dennis did not desert the band, they deserted him!"
2,Some of it is just hard to listen to.,"I have been a Styx fan for 28 years. This is by far the worst album that they have ever done. I am the Walrus is good, plus a few more, but several songs are just plain bad. Styx has been my favorite band since I was a teenager. I like both Styx and Dennis DeYoung now. I thought Cyclorama was very good as well as Dennis' orchestra CD. But this one is just plain bad overall. I'm sure that Dennis is either laughing at this CD or crying. Tommy and JY did well with Cyclorama, but they blew it with this one. This does not sound anything like the Styx I knew and loved."
1,Complete Waste of Time and Money,Tommy and JY seriously need to get a clue...Without Dennis They S**k and no matter what they do. This album of covers proves exactly that. If you want to hear Great and reworked Styx music try Dennis De Young live with Symphony Orchestra. He shows why he will always be THE VOICE of Styx. Either Tommy and JY stop throwing a temper tantrum and acting like babies and rejoin with Dennis and be Styx as it should be or Tommy And JY should retire and quit the music business and stop ripping the fans off. As far as im concerned Tommy and JY NEED Dennis but Dennis doesnt need them at all.
1,"album title should be ""Styx covers the Classics""","I have very rarely ever completely regretted the purchase of any music CD...until now.I have been out of the loop on Styx's releases over the last few years, but I did know that Dennis DeYoung was out of the band. Worst move Styx ever made. Apparently DeYoung was the only one with any song-writing talent. Realizing this, the rest of the band has decided to become a ""cover"" band. What a waste.Styx used to be great band with a music style that ranged all over the board, but they had a sound and character that was uniquely, Styx.A lot of the songs on this CD are great songs, but they were better by the original artists. I don't buy a Styx album to hear them cover other artist's stuff. I buy it because I want to hear new Styx stuff. There are a couple songs on this CD I didn't recognize, but the songwriting credits don't list any current band member names, so I assume they are covers as well.Sad end to a formerly great band."
1,If I Could Rate This A ZERO... I Would!,"Being a lifelong Styx fan I was eagerly awaiting this CD. After the first listen I can honestly say it's one of the WORST albums I have EVER heard! What were these guys thinking? I'm fine with bands doing cover albums, but for God's sake pick some songs that are a good fit for your style! ""I am The Walrus"", etc.? UGH! Only the updated version of ""Blue Collar Man"" is even listenable.I understand that there's a rift between Dennis DeYoung and the remainder of the group, which is truly a shame. Maybe Dennis could have talked a very talented Tommy Shaw from being involved in such a wasted effort.Tommy, PLEASE make ammends with Dennis and write some new material that gives the true fans at least one more sampling of the TRUE Styx!"
5,"Didn't think I would like it, but WOW","I highly recommend this album, not just to Styx fans but to music fans. They definitely add their own flare, but keep the versions close enough to the orgininals that they show they are paying homage to those artists. What a fun record."
2,Merely Pleasant,"I Am the Walrus - was never a favorite of mine, and Styx didn't hurt it here, but they didn't do anything to make it theirs either.The same can be said for virtually every other song on this CD except:A Salty Dog - misses Gary Brooker's vocal.Manic Depression - besides Hendrix his own bad self, the best cover of this was done by King's X on the Dogman CD.Locomotive Breath - is remarkably punchless compared to the Jethro Tull original.Wishing Well - I wish they hadn't done it. Suffers from a horrible vocal.Talkin' About the Good Times - very nice.Blue Collar Man @ 2120 - I don't get the reference to 2120. And I don't see why the re-do was necessary. And I don't care for the arrangement.My criteria for a review of a cover: If I'd heard these songs for the first time by the cover artist, would I buy the record - yes, I'm that old - anyway?In this case, no.Save your money. Better yet, buy the originals.I'm just glad I bought it used."
5,Creative and Fun,"Styx has done it again. Even though there was some controversy as to what to expect from the legendary group's album of cover songs, they have proven those doubts completely wrong by delivering an amazing hit CD to their fans both old and new. I really enjoyed listening to their new spins on songs such as ""Summer In the City"", ""I Am The Walrus"" and ""One Way Out"". I cannot even begin to tell you the numerous numbers of albums I have bought and kept having to press the skip button. ""Big Bang Theory"" has to be the first in while where I didn't have to press it once. I really liked every song. The band's decision to make an ""all cover"" album has nothing to do with a lack of creativity. Their long list of hit songs proves otherwise. This album is a great addition to the Styx catalog."
2,cookie cutter,They seem to have a good grasp on the different styles. Too bad about the industry standard sound and overwrought delivery.
1,Whale vomit alert!,"...oh that is what someone said back in the day they really did rock.Cyclorama = PukeOrama! It's not that they suck without Dennis DeYoung-- It's how MUCH they suck without Dennis DeYoung. OMYGAWD! At least Rush is STILL RUSH!~~~ How about this idea: I know someone who saw Triumph in concert back in the day, and I DO PLAY GUITAR, so I think I'll just hit road and call my band Triumph, play some Triumph songs and record new material with the name too! ~~~I'm gonna spend some $$ for the Wooden Nickel collection instead. I'm from Illinois, and remember STYX before most of the so called fans of today actually heard of them. I remember when it was a good feeling.. a Rock and Roll Feeling!!! For those who agree, sorry for the bad pun."
1,Should be called Big Bomb Theory,"All I can say is this album stinks! Their ""new"" version of Blue Collar Man is just about the worst thing I have ever heard! I can't believe they can hear this album and Cyclorama and not be crawling on there knees begging Dennis DeYoung to come back and so he can ""fix"" this band and make Styx something good again!"
2,oh my God.............,It sounds like the crap I used to jam out to when I was like - 15! What happened to this band? What happened to their creativity? I don't believe anyone cares (as much as the artists themselves) about how they sound singing someone elses songs. Jeez! I agree with a previous post - WAKE UP STYX!
1,WHEN YOU FIRE THE MAIN GUY THIS IS WHATS LEFT,An album of covers by a band pretending to be a band that because of big egos got rid of the guy who made the band .whata concept TOMMY SHAW and JAMES YOUNG should really be ashamed of themselves for even calling this STYX.John lennon is rolling over in his grave with this quirky rendition of I AM THE WALRUSwhy bother with any of this STYX ended in 1999 when they booted DENNIS DEYOUNG and is just pathetic .and for anyones informationthe man was sick at that time and was unable to tour so the egotistical TOMMY SHAW and the reguritating J.Y.fired him.Go see Dennis if you want to see what styx was and will always be.
1,Ouch...that's painful,"I think rather than get into the pre Dennis vs Post Dennis discussions I'll just share my thoughts on this CD on it's own merits (or lack thereof)I really tried to approach this with an open mind.. putting aside that this is a Styx release.That being said, It's just awful.. not because it's covers, but it isnt even good covers.It's pretty obvious, at least to me that they just mailed this in. Too bad, there is a lot of musical/songwriting talent in the group and they, and us, deserve much better than this.If you're looking for highlights, Blue Collar Man at 2120 is a nice acoustic version of the original. If you use any legal downloading service, that track is well worth the 99 cents.My advice, dont bother. You'll find yourself longing for the original versions of these songs...or longing for the days of Such great songs as Angry Young Man/Suite Madame Blue..Oops, I said I would do that.. sorry. Im old. :-)"
3,Better than most,"Ok - I'm on my third listen now. It is better than most of the ""Wooden Nickel"" recordings and better than Kilroy, Edge, and Brave New world. Not as good as some of my all time favorites like GI and PT. About as good as Cyclorama. This version of Styx is a true Rock group and this is a good Rock record. My favorite is ""Can't Find My Way Home"" I miss Dennis in the Group - but I like this group as it is too. It is worth picking up and listening too - if you like what Rock N Roll used to be!"
1,Not The Styx I Know,"Who is this group and why have they hijacked the Styx name? This is such a sad comedown for a once great progressive rock band.This collection of songs, while having a few decent renditions, ""I Can See for Miles"" and ""Can't Find My Way Back Home"", is mostly simply adequate and not very good.I was a huge fan of Styx, but this group of performers, bearing little resemblance to the original group, has done the name of Styx very wrong.My recommendation: Don't buy this. Buy the Wooden Nickel collection. That is the real Styx."
1,God this CD sucks!,"Stynx owes US stars, this thing is so bad.I got a copy of ""Big Bust Theory"" for free. I smashed it flat, broke the CD and the case into small bits and put the remains and fifty or so small pieces of paper with WHERE'S DENNIS? printed on them and mailed the whole thing to Stynx's manager.No Dennis DeYoung? NO EFFIN' STYX."
5,The New Styx,"Even though this album doesn't have Dennis Deyoung I am still giving it a 5 star. It was great hearing all the old songs redone and the new Blue Collar Man. Tommy, Todd, Jy, Lawrence and Ricky are great as the new Styx, but Dennis Deyoung made Styx what it is today. He Jy and Tommy need to settle there differences so all Styx fans new and old can rejoice and reopen Paradise once again."
1,I got 2 words for ya...............,Kareeeee Oakeeeeee. I heard better cover tunes on the K-Tel label!!!!!!
2,"Oh well, it ain't your(my) generations Styx","I have been a Styx fan since the mid 70's... A talented bunch in all incarnations of the band... as far as who's in and who's out... ain't gonna do it, wouldn't be prudent... Ain't none of my business...For the music on this album... I gave it a listen... and another... It was ok, but its not somthing that will make it to the replay list again. When I find myself forwarding to the next track a minute into a song on the second run through I know I'm not liking it all that much...I wont be buying another cover album by these guys... Hopefully they can get something out of this to work towards thier next original content release..."
1,Do they really need money this bad?,"This is one of the worst albums I have bought in years. It breaks no new ground and doesn't leave one with the feeling that the band put any thought into what they were recording. I can't decide if Styx is turning into just a poor covers band or really need money. The musicianship is good, but the vocals and arrangements are poor. After listening to this and some of Dennis DeYoung's recent work, as a old Styx fan, I have one request: Guys, please make up and get back together."
1,Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse......,"Wow. How hard up are these guys now that Dennis DeYoung is out of the band? Unlike the previous poster, I have actually listened to Big Bang Theory and if you like listening to poor imitations of the real thing, this is your CD. It is painfully obvious that these guys have no creative juice left in them - I mean they have now put out a half dozen live albums, 4-5 re-released packages, and now they put out an album of cover tunes - including covering one of their own (the much overrated ""Blue Collar Man"" which these guys refuse to let die - even though it didn't even crack the top 20 when it was out in 1978. If you doubt this, look how many times it appears on ""Arch Allies"" with REO Speedwagon). Combine this with there tour schedule that has them playing at airport fields and rinky dink carnivals and you have to admit that Styx has gone the Spinal Tap route."
1,it sucks,"Styx is nothing without Dennis DeYoung, that is what I thought. But when I heard cyclorama I changed my mind. Cyclorama didn't sound like other Styx albums, but it wasn't bad at all. What I do not like is the live shows of this Styx. Lawrence Gowan sings the songs of Dennis, but he doesn't sings good at all. But now about this album: it sucks big time. It is a cover album, that could be nice sometimes, but they really played bad here. I guess I was right, Styx is nothing without Dennis. They don't have any originality anymore. Don't buy this! Avoid this item!"
4,Macrobiotic Miracle,I read this book while trying to find a way to cure myself of an autoimmune disease. All the medical community could offer me was massive doses of steriods which probably wouldn't work anyway. I found the book very helpful and inspiring. I followed the macrobiotic diet and within 6 months I was disease free. Try it. What have you got to lose?
2,Limited Guide,"Although Hoffman's book gives an adequate overview of the ""epidemic"" and reinforces to the reader the seriousness of the problem, his solutions are lacking. He never really gets to the root of the problem but shows many variables. Marcia Zimmerman's The ADD Nutrition Solution is a much better resource for the parent or teacher of a child with ADD."
1,Ick............,I found this book to be more high tech than possible for the average reader to understand. It was not helpful at all.
2,Better choices,"Search Amazon, there are some better choices. I bought 3 name books on Amazon...this was the worst."
1,Piece of junk,"Numerous voltage settings and adapters but that's where it stops. Plugged it into my iRiver H120 and caused all kinds of electronic popping, cracking, & static to be introduced into the line out feed. I've since used other adapters that do not suffer from the same problem. Piece of junk, stay away from."
2,O.K. But not all that scary.,The scariness to each author is subjective. Barely any of these stories would of ever scared me.
3,Sigh.,"I found this book to be as average and blah as most of the people that picked them. Some notable exceptions, but overall, if you like your horror homogenized, pasturized, and generic, like most contemperary stuff is, then this is the book for you."
4,Fun Reading For Halloween,"What a great idea for a book! Wish the introductions were a little more detailed in some cases (Mr. King...), and as in any anthology not every story will be to your taste, but I enjoyed the added bonus of knowing which author chose which story. Now I've got to run out and find some more M.R. James. If you want to read the stories that inspired your favorite masters of the macabre, this is a great place to start."
3,Cool Clubgin' Song!,"This is a cool song to dance to in a club for sure and to jam out to in your car, but I see it getting played out on the radio, fast!"
4,Mellencamp Arrives,"The aptly-titled Uh-Huh is widely considered John Cougar Mellencamp's first great album. His brand of heartland rock blends the sounds of the Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen into something that is completely unique. ""Pink Houses"" is one of his best-known songs and is akin to Springsteen's iconic ""Born in the U.S.A,"" which it preceded. It's a rousing anthem of Middle America and is perhaps his most effective song to cover the subject. Mellencamp injects many of the tracks with his patent sarcasm; ""Serious Business"" and ""Lovin' Mother Fo Ya"" are humorous examples. ""Crumblin' Down"" and ""Authority Song"" are semi-autobiographic and equally disenchanted; they are also infectious. The album closes perfectly with the quiet, bittersweet ""Golden Gates."" The remastered edition includes a bonus acoustic version of ""Pink Houses"" that is arguably as good as the original and far more emotive. 4 Stars."
4,A very good rock album,"John Mellencamp really started to come into his own with this mid-1980's release. He reclaimed his real name (from the record company moniker of John Cougar)and he cut loose with some great rockers. He showed hints of his social consciousness with ""Pink Houses,"" letting the Ronald Reagan generation know that not everyone was living the American Dream. He showed he was still the bad boy with ""Crumblin' Down"", ""Play Guitar,"" ""Authority Song,"" and ""Serious Business."" Just around the corner for Mellencamp was his career masterpiece, Scarecrow. UH-Huh is a very good all-around rock album and is always fun to listen to."
5,Uh-Huh John Mellencamp,"Actually, I bought this CD for a friend and he is very happy with it. He is a big fan of Mellencamp and I knew he really wanted this. Thank you so much for making these old LP's available on CD now."
3,good product,this is a fairly good product. easy to use and really holds tight. another good thing is that it doesn't damage the corners of your picture frame.
5,Cuban music with a punch,"I love cuban music of all kinds, and I think this cd is a remarkable achievement from this group Cafe Nostalgia. They reinterpret and reorchestrate oldies from 50'S Havana, torch songs really, originally sung by La Lupe, Benny More, Bola de nieve and other singers of the era. These boleros and son are full of sentimental qualities, without ever being tacky. The producers are not content to repeat those beautiful songs, they rearranged them too so that they sound quite modern. Especially poignant is a song called ""Mis desenganos"" (my disillusion) done by a cuban male vocalist who works out of Miami (although originally written for a female singer) which will surely torn your insides. Superb album."
4,Good but with some disappointment,"I bought this set of audio CD's for my wife so that we could listen to them while traveling in the car. I believe that the set is good for that purpose. We are both fans of Jane Austen (my wife actually writes Jane Austen fan fiction) and know her stories well. So, it was disappointing to find that this collection was 'abridged'.But for the purpose of being able to listen and enjoy Jane Austen's work while traveling this is well worth the price.For me, I have learned to do a better job of research when looking into a product, but I have enjoyed very much listening to these productions.Enjoy listening!"
2,Before you buy,"I was looking for these books in an unabridge version. In the description is says (unabridged)which is misleading because they are not all unabridged! I was very disappointed when I received them and realized the books are not unabridged, these stories are too wonderful to have parts of them removed. The other thing I really do not like is that at the end of the chapters they play music that is really loud compared to the readers volume level. I like to listen to audio books while I am falling asleep, the music is too loud for me to use these to relax to."
4,Great Hand Protector!,"The glove does exactly what it's supposed to -- keeps me from cutting my left hand as I'm using clippers with my right hand to cut leaves and small branches into tiny (compostable) pieces. My husband bought it for me after I'd seriously cut my left fingers/knuckles several times. My only negative comment would be the fit on my wrist. It's a little loose and tends almost fall off my hand, despite the fact that it's a small glove. So I use my watch to hold it on."
5,Stainless Steel gloves saved my nephew from cuts on his fingers.,These gloves are great! My nephew graduated from Cordon Bleu Chef school. At Thanksgiving he told me about the tiny cuts he got from moving pans with sharp edges from station to station. He also told me about a store that sold chef equipment. The prices there were double the price I bought these gloves. These gloves are much better. My nephew was so pleased with the gift he was speechless. His fingers are much happier now. You may find gloves similar to these for less but they are not the same. You get what you pay for. These gloves are used 5 days a week with long shifts. Buy these gloves. The company is great to work with & shipped them quickly.
4,Always liked,"I've always liked this book. It's one of the few Regencies that I've kept on my shelf years after they've stopped publishing all the good authors. It's a bit of a switch; instead of the sweet heroine and saturnine, jaded hero, you've got the gorgeous but spoiled heroine and a hero who is smart, red-headed, and certainly not Mr. Corinthian.I think the romance could have been more ""romantic"" with a little more interaction between the characters or a little more Unresolved Sexual Tension (UST), but overall I thought it was a fun read with witty poems and well-drawn characters who really come to life, whether you like them or not."
3,Broken in under an hour!,"My action-figure obsessed 7-1/2 year old ordered this toy after seeing it in a toy store. Within an hour of play, one of the legs had broken off. If this was his 4 year old brother's, I wouldn't be surprised, but this was in the hands of a careful child! We have several of the smaller Mega Men coming for Christmas, and I only hope they are more durable than this one proved."
3,Decent collection of 70s Tucker lacks any singles,"""Long Hard Ride"" is probably the least known of MTB's 70s albums because it contained no big singles. Nevertheless, it is fairly representative of their 70s sound. There are both rockin' and country tracks with a few good lovesongs thrown in. If you own Tucker classics like ""A New Life"" and ""Where We All Belong"" and are looking to supplement your collection, you could certainly do worse."
4,A BREATH OF FRESH AIR,"Out of the 8 tracks, only 6 are outstanding, which is why I rated it a 4. Long Hard Ride gives you a feeling that you are out in the open riding hard on a stallion, riding free. Property Line makes you want to stomp your feet and chug a few beers. Am I The Kind Of Man is an introspective song and it makes you stop to think and reflect. Now, Walkin' The Streets Alone, it's as joyful as a song can get, as a matter of fact it is SO joyful that it brings tears to my eyes. Windy City Blues has shades of Long Hard Ride and it's good to listen to, but you want to go to the next song, Holding On To You. Now, there's a song that you want to listen to while you are driving along the scenic Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. It's so great and it brings more tears to my eyes. The last two songs? Forget them. They're terrible, so terrible that the last time I listened to them was 10-15 years ago."
2,Not very potent,I was looking for flavor drops and oils to make my own metromint-type water.. I added 16 drops of this stuff to a 32 oz bottle and I still couldn't taste the chocolate at all.. however for the spearmint flavor I only needed one or two drops
2,Music lacks charm,"All Time Favorite Dances has all the dance instructions I needed, but the music is bland and lacks the charm of the original recordings."
2,Poor Dragonlance book.,"Unpopular setting in the timeline, coupled with a writing style that seems to be emulating Weis & Hickman but failing, make this entire trilogy overall unremarkable. Only worth reading to keep up with the setting storyline."
1,The Mess Continues,"With such a horrible first book in the trilogy, the Dawning of a New Age, my expectations for the second, Day of the Tempest were very close to as low as you can go. In that, I wasn't disappointed.Why read the second if the first was so bad, you ask? I had bought Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's 2001 return to Krynn, The War of Souls Trilogy, this past summer. I noticed that events and characters from other Dragonlance franchise books were making an appearance in Weis and Hickman's new trilogy. So, after a 17 year absence, I travelled back to the world of Krynn to explore.Even as a simple rest stop on the roads of Krynn's history, The Day of the Tempest is something that could be skipped for the next exit farther down the highway. There is no improvement in the awful, nearly nonsensical plot, characters, and descriptions. And it won't get any better in the third book of the trilogy, The Eve of the Maelstrom."
3,Blah,The first two books read like simple timelines. Character A traveles to location B to retrieve / rescue C. I went back and re-read the first 50 pages of the original Weiss/Hickman series and the disparity is striking. Jean Rabe writes like she learned fantasy from a how-to guide.
4,"Fair, But Fun","I was excited that new DragonLance books were coming out, so I instantly bought the new books. But were fun to read and compare the new heroes to the originals. I do feel though that Rabe lacks the magical and captivating feeling that Weis and Hickman create. Over all though I was pleased that the land of Krynn will forever live."
5,Disapointed yet condoled...,"Where did Palin go? He was the main character in The Dragons Of Summer Flame, and now he is gone! What happened to those 30 years? Now he's old...and not nearly in the spotlight. But I am impressed by Dhamon and Feril. The twisted fate befallen on Dhamon, and the interesting magic of Feril, and there, maybe not to be, love, of coarse. If anyone could give me more info on sequels...It is so hard to find the right book..."
4,Krynn's survival against the mighty dragon overlords.,This book is a great place to start for the Dragonlance 5th age lover. You will find out information about the bigger dragons of Krynn. These overlords try to take Palin and his companions. With a little luck and skill the adventurerers survive through the overlords territories. This book is a good book with a suspenseful ending that may not have been expected. The new heroes struggle for a chance of survival along with the mysteries of magic while the dragonoverlords are always one step ahead.
2,I hated it,"I couldn't get past the first 150 pages of it. I just found myself lossing to much interest in the story to the point where I didn't care what happened to the characters or Krynn. You could skip this trilogy and completely understand what's going on on Krynn during the War of Souls. Rabes style of writing just isnt for me I guess. The first book of the series was good, but not really this one in my opinion.If you have nothing better to read, then pick this up, other than that I dont think it's worth it."
1,Awful,This book was just horrible. The plot was--well actually there wasn't much of a plot. The characters certainly didn't act the way they're supposed to. I wish Jean Rabe would stop writing books.
2,"New point of view, not one to follow","The dragons are portrayed better than the heroes. I can get behind Malystryx, destroy things. not much else about it. Khellendros is a little more complex, not much though, and I think the heroesare pitiful. They have no real backround, and the backround they give is always contridicting the ones revealed. This book shows no comparrison, what so ever to other dragonlance novels, like The Legend Of Huma (5 Stars). The best part of the novel was the dragons but I cant even say they were too well thought up or portrayed."
2,A poor attempt at a Dragonlance book,"This book was a little better than the first in the series. However, it was awful. Its too far fetched even for a fantasy, and especially for trying to be a Dragonlance fantasy. I dont see how Palin can teleport himself or others so easily when his uncle Rastlin was the greatist sorcerer of all time and it nearly killed him when he did it.... that is so lame. Palin seems to be this super powerful mage even though he lost his magic. Also, they keep reffering to the lance Rig carries as ""Sturm's Lance"" and we all know Sturm never used a lance, he used his fathers sword and NEVER learned to use a lance (read chronicles vol. 2, Jean Rabe). These errors and other make this book hard to read.I would not reccomend this book to those who just want a fantasy adventure to read, but us die-hard dragonlancers have to read it because it is part of the overall series of books in the Dragonlance timeline, which is sad."
2,Garbage.,"Very, very disappointing. Admittedly, I hadn't expected much after the first book. But in this volume the characters are poor, the story weak and the style lacking. Jean Rabe abuses Margaret Weis' and Tracy Hickman's once near-perfect characters to the point where Palin, Goldmoon and Gilthanas are changed beyond recognition. There is no flow to events, everything is told matter-of-factedly without and time spent on those little details that are so crucial. Emotion is lacking and all the characters' personalities are somehow the same. Factor in an unrealistic and unconvincing plot and this ends up a very disappointing Dragonlance novel. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman COME BACK!"
4,It's fine.,"I admit that this is my second Dragonlance book, but I think it was fairly good.I especially enjoyed the attack to claim the prisoners from the Knights.Also people complain about Palin's family's names being similar, I should relate you to J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Hobbit. A.k.a, Balin, Dwalin (Brothers) Fili, Kili (Brothers) Oin, Gloin (Brothers) Nori, Ori, and Dori (Brothers... I admit there was some flaws but it still was a fairly good book."
1,"Indeed, this is Krynn's darkest hour.","Rabe is writing books. Dragonlance books. I just reread the Chronicles, compared the two, and could not believe that this book was DL. My god. Don't read this! Everything is bland and boring. It is heartbreaking to fans of Krynn and its heroes."
1,How tragic..,"Well, the world of Krynn has been changed in more ways than one. There's Jean Rabe writing Dragonlance books now. As with any other of Jean Rabe's works, the characters act like robots, there's no plot, the writing style is that of a 10 year old, but sometimes the way the characters act are funny. (Funny because it's just ludicrous and there's absolutely no basis for the character to act that way.)"
1,Still awful.,"The characters are still two-dimensional, the plot is still go-to-sleep material, and the Great Dragons still seem as dumb as ever. One would wonder how they ever got beyond hatchlings with intelligence levels like that. Rabe just doesn't hit it at all. There's no sense of tragedy or loss, and the heroes don't really seem to have a place in the world. Rabe seems to concentrate on the 'Great Cosmic Struggle' rather than what motivates the characters who're making the story. There's also too much focus on the Evil characters (the dragons). Entire sections of the plot, which could have been artfully hidden and hinted at until finally being revealed, are thrown at the reader from the outset, and all that's left to see is how the heroes are going to thwart their foes. Yawn."
3,Ok for occasional use,"I've only used this a few times, clearing paths through some raspberry bushed and other prickly stuff.It seems fine for light use, the scabbard is OK and the saw back on the blade works well for heavier bushes (I'd say maximum 1/2"" diameter soft bushes).The blade, even after sharpening with a high-end stone, isn't as sharp as I'd like. On free-hanging stuff like bushes, vines, etc. it's only slightly better than using a piece of rebar or a big stick."
1,Gerber machete- NOT up to par,"I own and love many Gerber Products. This Machete is not one of them.The blade bent and cracked on the first swing at some 1/4""-1/2"" thickbrush. This Item not worthy of the Gerber name.Scott PhillipsFranktown Colorado"
3,Gator Machete,I've been looking for a good machete for some time. I'm also a big fan of Gerber products. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be as well made as most of their products. I've found them locally for under $15 and for the price it's worth having for light stuff. My search for a proper machete continues.
1,This is not a work Machete,This Machete is not a brush clearing achete. It is basically a 14-15 year olds dream knife that they can show off to their friends. Or could be very easily used as a close quarters defense weapon.
4,Good enough for me,"I purchased this for clearing brush that consisted of TONS of vines and pricker bushes. Also since I used last weekend when it was still sort of winter, most of the stuff wasn't full of life. It cut anything I tried. I was pretty happy with it. It wasn't as sharp as I would have hoped but if you run out and get a sharpening stone it probably wouldn't be a bad idea. But overall out of the box it was able to cut through the vines and such. I would recommend or lend this to a friend in need of the same. I plan on using it again next weekend without sharpening it."
1,needs to be sharpened,"This is priced about the same as U.S. military machetes, available through army surplus stores. Be prepared to have this tool sharpened before use because all it does is bend what it hits. There is nothing more dangerous than a dull tool (except a dull user). So it will cost you about $10 and a week wait time to bring the edge to something sharper than a butter knife."
1,Dont use the tip,I bought this for my survival bag. I bought a house and wanted to clear some brush so I figured I'd try it out. Not only is it not full tang like the other reviewers said but it is weak. The entire curved area of the tip got all bent up just from normal use. I've bent it back a few times but it always bends back again. I'll keep using it until it breaks or I hurt myself using it.
2,Kinda crappy.,Flimsy. This is the post recall new version. I torture tested my old version before sending it back for replacement. It failed. I actually used it to cut down a Home Depot aluminum patio cover that got crushed by snow. The aluminum tore the blade. The sheath is great. Because its so thin its actually perfect for small branches. But for cutting saplings or bigger I recommend a milspec Onterio machette.
1,Anybody received a recalled/new version?,"I'm a little dismayed that so much info has come out since I ordered this tool. I have registered to send it back for the handle recall, but really don't use it as my ""go to"" camp saw, so wasn't in the target recall group. The tang situation is distressing though. I cannot see how they would be so concerned about handle slippage and not take the opportunity to address the ridiculous lever stress point they have created in the front of the handle. The Gerber recall hotline says replacement has a modified handle, lanyard addition, ""and other safety modifications"". Has anyone received their replacement Gator and disassembled? You can buy a full tang machete on Amazon for $7.99 today, so Gerber deserves the reputation hit if they dont lengthen the tang while they have the chance."
3,Expected More From the Gerber Name,"I bought this machete because Gerber is known for quality blades. But right out the box, I was dissapointed. It has a very flimsy feel to it. As mentioned in other reviews, this machete does not have a full tang. I do have to admit, though, the serrated side is very useful for cutting down limbs from my palm trees, so it wasn't a complete waste of money."
1,not sharp at all,I've seen $5 machetes that were far sharper than this. I've bought many items from Gerber and I've been happy with all of them. I was extremely disappointed with this one. It's a joke in fact. It wouldn't cut weeds consistently much less brush. I have a cheap machete that I've been using for years to keep my ATV trails clear around my property. I was hoping for a machete that would hold an edge longer. I got one that won't take an edge at all. Don't waste your money here. There are better machetes elsewhere.
2,Wimpy,"Blade is too thin.Light weight,Very sharp and the best for the price for around home.Would not go on a safari with it"
4,Great gator,"This is almost exactly what I expect out of a machete. It's just too long. I've used it to chop down a 1ft in diameter tree without too much time or effort spent. It does everything you want a machete to do, at a great price, with an excellent grip and a good scabbard. What more could you ask for? Even with its long size it's not unwieldy, I just should have gotten the Jr. I should mention that the saw-back works well, but you really shouldn't need it; the blade excels at chopping."
5,Quick,Our grand kids enjoyed the movie and it came in good time. Nice that they can share some of the memories we got from this movie also.
4,"Cai-ro ai-ro, Illinois!","I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Frost's review, except for the fact that a soundtrack LP was indeed released by Reader's Digest. The music is as grand as the movie as a whole! What a great movie! What happened to Jeff East?"
4,"If it came out today, it would be considered a classic!!","Just listen to the beautiful songs in the score and notice the magestic sentiment... Although this movie has all but been forgotten, I'm sure that one day people will give it a chance. If you like musicals and you like Twain, then it's a must see, even for its many imperfections. There are some incredibly witty songs and some truly poinient moments. The song ""Freedom"" is one of the most powerful songs I've ever heard-- and for some reason the LP was never even released... go figure."
2,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, DVD, Jeff East version","It's a musical! I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known that, and it wasn't notes in the advertising blurb. Had I read the reviews I would have twigged, but I didn't. All those unrealistically cleanclothed happy black faces bobbing up from their cotton picking singing happily was a turn-off right fromthe start. (U|I didn't go any further.) Of course, if you like musicals................."
5,One of the best girl group albums in years,"My first encounter will the All Saints was the wonderful ""exploding fruit"" UK video for ""Never Ever"". After 10 or 15 times, I still wasn't tired of it, so I bought the cd (which was so popular I had to visit several shops before I could find a copy). I was not disappointed. All of the songs were at least good, and many were excellent. I even like their cover of ""Under the Bridge"" better than the Chilli Peppers' version. (Heresy, I know, but that's they way it is. That video was great too, at least the UK version.)These are intelligent, talented women at the start of their careers. They can write, they can sing, they look good -- they ought to go far. But whether they can survice as All Saints the pressures of their success remains to be seen."
1,Should've bought the single NOT the album,"There was only one song on there that I really liked, ""Never Ever"". The rest of the songs were drab. After listening to the entire album, I should have looked for the single. The group redid a song that Red Hot Chili Peppers sang (forgot the song name). They should have left it alone instead of driving it to the ground. As much as I dislike RHCP, I liked their version of the song."
2,Good singing but pitiful lyrics and harmonies.,"All Saints is almost exactly like the Spice Girls except that they write their own songs and they can accually sing. However they stink at writing their songs, they are repititious and boring. They wasted alot of talent on really bad songs."
1,I hope it's their last album,"First, I am always a fair person and I think myself have a fair taste of all kinds of music. But, it's a pity you don't have a HALF STAR selection."
3,Songs are all alike and not worth listenin to,"Well, this CD is pretty good if you only listen to the first two songs, after that it it BOR-ING! My advice is, don't buy it, just listen to your friend's CD of it, it'll save you $12.95 (I think that's the price of it) which can be spent on better things, like a new pair of undies!"
3,All Saints are all right,"While this CD was better than I expected, it's just OK. Their voices are average, but their songs catch attention. The best ones are ""Never Ever"", ""Under the Bridge"", ""Heaven"", ""Trapped"", ""War of Nerves"", and ""Lady Marmalade""(although they can't top Patty Labelle on that one). As you'd guess, most of the songs are about love and partying(and what's wrong with that?) Maybe someone else should rap. Shaznay really does sound like she's imitating Bart Simpson. With better production, their talent can be showcased more effectively on their next album."
1,sex pistols rock all saints are ugly,this album is k but its not really the musci which is an issue. There girls are plain and run of the mill. What we need is better girls to sing and put on a show and reveal as much of themselves to the public as possible(in way of skin)apart from that I think that if u listen to music the sex pistols are a much better band and listen to them
4,Awesome cd,"I thought this cd was really good. I love the song ""Never Ever"". A few other great songs are ""I know where it's at"", ""Lady Marmalade"", and a remake of the Red Hot Chillie Peppers song ""Under the Bridge"". I didn't particularly enjoy the song ""Booty Call"", but otherwise the cd was awesome."
2,Promised much but ultimately dissapointing.,"Having heard the singles, and subsequently watched them top the charts, I was eager to check out the maiden album by these very talented new soul and R&B singers. But it soon became evident that the singles were the only tracks shining on this album. I am left with the conclusion that the album was hastily thrown together to meet market demand, and ultimately dissapoints."
4,I love all saints!!!!!!,"The All Saint's are the best thing to come out of Britain since the Spice Girls. I love the funky, dance groove of ""I Know Where It's At"" and the naughty remake of ""Lady Marmalade"". My favorite song is, of course, ""Never Ever"", a true classic. They do an excellent R&B cover of ""Under The Bridge"" and the soulful ""War of Nerves"" is also a favorite of mine. And just for the pure guilty pleasure of it, check out ""Bootie Call"". It's fun, sexy, and the girls look hot in their video!"
1,Never Ever,"They have covered some good songs - Under The Bridge, but it is no way as good as the original. I don't think All Saints will last too long, ( I'll put my money that by Christmas people will say REMEMBER ALL SAINTS ). I don't think they have much talent, especially for live performances. Their only good song - Never Ever is no longer as good as it used to be. It been played to much and that ruined it. So, for All Saint the album, I'd have to say - NEVER EVER"
4,All Saints rock!!!!!,This is a REALLY good cd!! They have really hit it off with the teenage community! Everyone LOVES them and won't stop talking about them! So if you don't already own it then go out and buy it NOW!!! All Saints are like the Spice Girls in a lot of ways...but with way more taste and personality...I think every song on this cd is good and that everyone would enjoy it...So go buy it now!
1,All Saints Don't Know Where It's At,"I don't know how anyone who has listened to any of the Saints singles could possibly but this album. The songs, for the exception of Lady Marmalade are very long and boring, especially : Saints version of Under The Bridge (an old classic), Never Ever and especially Booty Call. Forget about buying this album"
1,Dont like any of the songs,I think their music is tasteless.They have no talent and are the most unorigional band.They cant even copy well...their version of 'Under the bridge' sucks.Singing is definately not meant for them.
1,All Saint's have definatly gone Under The Bridge with this,"I quite liked the All Saints single Never Ever, but after hearing the album, I don't know what I was thinking. For the acception of Never Ever, the rest of the songs are just like the B sides you put on a single because there not good enough to get to number 1. All Saints are a mix between Eternal & Spice Girls. Shaznay is the only one with an ounce of talent, the rest are usless, especially Mel B. ( talk about copying the Spice Girls ) I don't know how the singles got to Number 1, but at least this crap album only got to Number 3 I think ( it didn't get to No. 1 anyway )"
2,"Well, At Least They're Better Than The Spice Girls......","That might not be saying much, but it is something.....I guess. Unless you're a fan of mindless, corporate product pop drivel deviod of heart (in which case you can disregard most of this review), if you own this you probably bought this for the same reason I did---the soulful single ""Never Ever."" If you haven't bought it yet, save your money and just get the single. The rest of the album really isn't worth mentioning. At all. What really gets me about this whole thing though, is that these girls really do have talent, and when given the right sort of songs, can sing with a lot of heart and soul. It's a tragic waste. For God's sake, someone PLEASE get them some better material before they slide into the depths of obscurity."
5,JUST LIKE OLD DAYS,I cannot believe that i stumbled back upon this album. I used to own it but somehow misplaced it four years ago. It takes me back so much and i love every single song on this cd. Too bad All Saints never really made a good cd after this one.
4,Pretty good! :-),"Ok. A couple years ago I heard the song ""Never Ever"" on the radio. I absolutely loved All Saints' voices and the smooth beat. I got the CD a few weeks ago, and it RULES! My favorite songs are, ""Never Ever"", ""Bootie Call"", ""Under The Bridge"", ""Heaven"", ""Trapped"" and, ""Lady Marmalade"". Otherwise, none of the other songs catch my interest. But I think the BEST song is ""Under The Bridge"" cuz it's got an awesome sound to it and a GREAT beat. Although there's not too many 5-stars songs on this album, it's definitely worth bying. I would if I were you."
1,Makes you ashamed to be British,Call me cynical if you wish but this is a truly dreadful waste of space on CD. When will the music industry learn that people deserve to have at least some genuine attempt at music making to listen to. Not only have they made a good job of ruining some decent songs their attempts at originality are little better.
2,Borderline Album With Much Repetition,"When I first heard ""Never Ever"" I thought it was really good, but on closer inspection I realized that about 90% of this song was just repeating the same lines over and over. I like the songs ""I Know Where Its At"" and ""Under the Bridge"". My biggest problem is when the group tries to insert rap into their songs. Rap is OK if its done right but in this case it isn't. The album as a whole sounds as if the group is trying to imitate a musical sound that isn't theirs. This gives most of the songs a sense of psedo rhythm."
4,Totally Great and Highly Recommended!!,"This is a super cd highlighting the best of this cool band. From the opening chords of ""Every Beat of My Heart"" all the way through the collection you get a neat feeling. ""Monica's Light"", ""Collide"", ""In the Meantime"", ""Hours Go By"" are all super songs. Gary Newby and his gang are true songsmiths. They have style. Too bad they didn't get the recognition they deserved in the States. Highly recommended to anyone a fan of true pop music that was pre-Nirvana."
4,Crucial omissions but plenty of good music,"Must have been a licensing thing, as material from the Factory debut isn't included, well except for a demo of ""Listen On"". I think ""Reunion Wilderness"" was released in the US on Virgin though; whatever the case this isn't really a comprehensive best of.Still, it's a good place to start if you are looking to give TRC a shot. This best of concentrates a bit much on the dancier side of the band. There are great songs around from the 2nd and 3rd CDs including some new unreleased tracks.Check out ""Everybody"". Highly addictive guitar work. Most of the standards are included, the popular ""Every Beat of the Heart"", the wistful ""Somewhere South"" and ""In the Meantime"" and the dancier ""Music Stop"" and ""Something So Good""."
3,Crucial song(s) omitted - why!,"Any ""best of"" that omits the song ""A Pleasure"" from the Recurrence CD cannot truly be called ""best of."" That song contains one of the all-time great guitar riffs in any genre.Other than that, a great compilation, especially in light of the fact that many great CDs from many great bands are out of print or are going OOP...."
5,A great begining book - Ottimo per Iniziare !,"Great book for beginners ! I will review it for the italian language peoples.Ottimo libro per iniziare a conoscere VFP, L'autore accompagna il lettore in tutte le caratteristiche essenziali del linguaggio e dell'ambiente, fornendo sufficienti informazioni per prendere possesso di questo ambiente di sviluppo ricco di caratteristiche."
1,Worst programming book I read,"I had experience in many different computer languages and I would like to learn Foxpro since job's need. I bought this book and felt very disappointment. Computer language and programmin is a skill and does not have very deep theory with it. Give a few examples and reader follow it and repeat it, then he can do it. But this book did not give a single complete example and use too much description pages to pages. Most of them are no useful."
5,The Meaning of Friendship,Big Bird looses his home and his positive outlook but all his friends help him out. This story teaches kids how to cope with difficult situations and how to come out of them successfully. Granny Bird is the best!
3,Cut out EVERYTHING!,"Below is ALL of the following scenes that they cut-out from the 5-part TV special:1.That cute little song ""Feline"" in part 12.Telly looking out of the window during the hurricane and his mother calls him over for dinner.3.The end of part 1 where Oscar says ""If you really gotta know, Sesame Street was brought to you by the Letter so and so and by the Number so and so.4.That funny little song in part 1,""Danger,Danger!"".5.The end of part 1, where Big Bird goes up into Maria and Luis' bed.Sesame Workshop should air the Hurricane episodes at least once a month! (But my 4-year old brother likes it, so what can I say?)"
2,Would Big Bird shut up please?,"This movie is alright as far as the story goes. I never saw the week long video that another reviewer spoke of so I didn't miss anything. I also liked that they talk rationally of things that happen in a hurricane and hurricane preparedness given that we live in a hurricane prone area.However, listening to Big Bird whine through the whole movie is unbelievably annoying. I don't really like Big Bird usually because all he ever does is whine, but I can usually ignore him. But this movie takes place around Big Birds experience during the hurricane, so it's kind of hard to ignore him.I think there are plenty of other Sesame Street movies that I would buy over this one. In fact, I would buy ANY OTHER Sesame Street video over this one because of Big Birds whining. I don't really want my child to learn from his behavior either."
2,More focused on non-muppets than muppets,"We only made it through the first 1/3 of this DVD before our 2-year old wanted us to change DVD's (and that was after she walked out of the room for a few minutes). The first third seems to have too much talking by non-muppets, which my toddler did not care about. Also, a 2-year old does not really care about taping up windows and getting jugs of water. I may fast forward to when big bird's nest is destroyed and see if the DVD gets better."
2,Big Bird is big time annoying,"This is probably the one video that gets on my nerves!!Big Bird does nothing but whine the whole entire time about his nest being destroyed. Even when everyone is trying to help repair it, he still isn't happy. His voice just grates on my ears.My daughter really likes it though, so what can I say."
4,Gaming Mouse,I initially had issues with the mouse maintaining connection with my computer. I found a software application from Yahoo that kept disconnecting it. Once the software was removed I have had very little trouble. The mouse is comfortable to use and has quick response during my gaming. I have recommended this mouse to some of the other people that participate with me on line in Counter Strike.
1,dont buy,"I got this mouse, and after a while you will realise that the software is unstable, the mouse keeps getting the jitters, the mouse display starts to dance on the screen, normally near the top of the screen and on the side bars.Downloaded the latest drivers did not improve the situation, so I contacted the company, who promised to comeback within 5 days??? still waiting two weeks later, dont touch it, its terrible and a waste of money."
3,No support,"So far the mouse functions, but the drivers included aren't working, can't program the buttons, and the company's website won't come up. Fortunately the DPI settings don't require drivers. I'd say you're better off with a Logitech or Razer for 10 bucks more."
2,Best camera ever,"What can I say about this technological materpiece? It captures a whopping 1.3 megapixals, saves directly to 3.5"" floppy disk, can take up to 100 pictures on a single charge, and comes in at a light 3 pounds (lighter than a 6 pack of beer). I don't like this new trend of miniature electronics. I say why not get more for your money? This camera goes great with my Zach Morris cellular telephone."
1,Get something better!,My hair gets caught and pulled out in this. My hair is only wavy and it doesn't straighten my hair as well as a curling iron does. I am going to spend more and get something that works better.
3,ok. but ouch.,"Got this as a gift. It works alright, but snags my hair between the ceramic plates and plastic, leaving me a few strands shy of a full head of hair after completing the job. Overall I'd still give it 3 stars because it did straighten my thick curly hair, but I'd still like to find one that didn't snag my hairs..."
5,the long elusive lime extract,"I was delighted to just find lime extract. It was not available in any of the supermarkets or specialty shops I checked in my area of TX. I haven't used it yet, but feel I probably have a lifetime supply."
2,Not As Advertised,"This CD is great since it is ""solo piano"" by Dave Brubeck. You will love it. However, it is advertised as a two cd set, the second being a series of interviews on Dave Brubeck's life. This is no longer included, at least from what I can tell there is only room for the music cd. The product details need to be changed."
5,Great Solo Piano Music and a Very Good Recording,The music is written and played in an entertaining and engaging manner by Brubeck. Not many musicians can deliver this kind of sound today. Telarc has done a very good job with the recording. I highly recommend this disk.
4,Bonus Interview CD,I ordered the SACD in February and the Cronkite CD was included. The SACD is playable on a standard CD player.
4,Terrorists or Freedom Fighters,"A Tool for the Full Understanding of Who They Are and How They Affect Civilization Today by Ely Tavin and Yonah Alexander, Copyright 1986 by Department of Education and Culture, World Zionist Organization and The Institute for Studies on International Terrorism and Hero Books and with 164 pages"
3,no advantage over included ligature,"what a ligature does or doesnt can over-stated; this one did little, maybe nothing to change the sound of my wolf tayne metal mouthpiece."
3,Ligatures do little to change the sound,"I am a pro player and can't get over the ""magic"" people attribute to ligatures.I like the Rovner on my tenor for convenience, the large knob and quick install."
2,Darker than stock metal ligature,Sounded darker than my metal lig that came with my Beechler metal mpc. Didn't seem to brighten the any.
3,"Offbeat, but nice","Mani Ratnam's Yuva is not conventional, even for the famous director. The acting by Abhishek Bachchan is just like his award-winning father's. Ajay Devgan is a waste, and Vivek Oberoi is nice looking. Rani Mukherjee delivers a mature performance, Esha Deol is typical Bollywood, and Kareena Kapoor is beautiful. The story is entertaining, and the music is first-class. A B grade, because the movie is a bit overtaking, but pleasureable indeed."
2,Basic skills book - no advanced information,"If you're interested in learning anything other than the basics of Dreamweaver 3, then this is definately not the book. Granted it has very straightforward information, but goes very little beyond the basics of Dreamweaver 3.To learn the more advanced concepts and a more thorough presentation of Dreamweaver I would take a look at the Dreamweaver H.O.T. book by Lynda Weinman.I used both books when learning DW3 and the H.O.T. book was by far superior both in presentation and content."
5,CRYSTAVOX C.D.,"This trip down memory lane to the better days of rock is inspired by the hard driven message of Crystavox. A band who reached the height of their popularity in the early 90's when bands like Stripper controlled the christian rock scene. More true to their beliefs than some of the other ""main-stream"" bands of their time Adam Kemp the lead vocalist drives home a powerful and very inspirational message coupled with an incredible sound. i strongly reccomend this and their follOW-up album."
4,But even so. . .a fine book,I have always liked Kenneth Patchen poetry. This novel has a wonderful title. I would almost have to read it solely on the basis of the title. It is not the greatest prose I ever read but it was a very engaging tale. I have to admit that the whole time I was reading it I kept thinking to myself I bet Bob Dylan read this book. A lot of the names and imagery was reminiscent of the lyrics of Dylan. Since Patchen came first it stands to reason that he bore an influence on Bob Dylan. It is a very enjoyable read for anyone that likes surrealic prose. Patchen was always an outstanding poet and this book more than reveals his gift for writing prose.
4,"""TRACKDOWN BECOMES A SHOWDOWN""","This it the 34th book in the series. I have read all thirty four. I like Trackdown better than the last book but I don't think it is as good as many of the early ones. The early ones may be like the mountain man himself, they may be a thing of the past. Nate King is trying to trackdown his wife and daughter, Winona and Evelyn, who have been kidnapped by the Sa-gah-lee. They are a very primitate tribe. You will never guess why they wanted Winona and Evelyn. UGH!!!! King tracks for several days, overcomes many dangers and finally finds them but then he is captured by the Sa-gah-lee. Will they escape and if they do will they be eaten by the cannibal tribe of Dabi-mussa?? Have to read to find out. Thompson writes so it holds your attention, the books are fairly short and reads quickly. I can see the things happen in my mind as they do on paper. If you like stories about mountain men read this one and the earlier ones he wrote."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BOOK!,This is a wonderful book. I highly recommend this book. You will not be disappointed in this book. This book makes great gifts so order one for yourself and some for your friends!!
5,it'll matter,"really, really am enjoying the lyrics which seem like conversations with a friend. nick has a warm unforced voice and style. especially liked ""everything you've got"" and ""it'll matter"". amazing variety of accompianment by kelly mulhollan to flesh it all out. thanks for the reminders of the important things in life."
4,Outstanding girls' detective series!,"The Judy Bolton series is dazzlingly superior to the better-known ""girl detective"" series still available in bookstores, because the Judy Bolton books were written by a real individual rather than a succession of authors under a house pseudonym. The characters in Margaret Sutton's novels are individualized, and they grow and change. These were among my very favorite books in childhood and preteen years, and I have most of our old copies -- THE RAINBOW RIDDLE is one of the few that have disappeared. I remember how engagingly the narrative blends Judy's wedding day and honeymoon, including all the rite-of-passage activities and emotions, with the ""rainbow"" mystery. Another wonderful book along the same line is THE NAME ON THE BRACELET, in which Peter proposes to Judy and their friend Irene has a baby (with a nearly disastrous accidental switching of babies in the hospital)."
5,Wonderful,"Timely shipping, Great tasting coffee, make for a wonderful Christmas gift. Costomer service is terrific."
2,Primary book on Israel,"This book was bought along with another one, Countries of the World, Israel. That one is just by Fisher who co-authored this book, Welcome to My Country, Israel. I felt like this should have additional information since it was published in 2001 and there have been recent disturbances in Israel which began last fall. Unfortunately, it does not. The writing is larger and in simpler text. The material covered is less than half which was very disappointing. The photos in both are the same for the articles included. The only differences were the glossary, more books to read, videos and web sites listed. It might be a good book to use as a text for second graders, but I felt it to be deficient in comparison to the other book which is only a few dollars different in price."
2,"Comfortable & attractive, but stretches out quickly","I bought these shoes a year ago, in two different colors. They were very comfortable and they...looked...HOT. The only problem was that the leather upper quickly stretched out, on both pair, allowing my feet to slide forward and over the end of the shoe by an inch! That doesn't look good, I can tell you. I'm not sure if I bought a 1/2 size smaller that it would have even made a difference.Overall, it was wasted money because I cannot wear either pair now."
4,Comfortable but a little unstable.,"I got these shoes last year and I have worn them quite a bit since then. Even though the shoe feels very comfortable, the cushioning is fantastic, and it looks great, it is a bit unstable. I wear high heels all the time and have no problem walking in 4' heels but with this pair, I have a bit of a problem. Still, I don't regret buying this pair."
3,Cheap Compass,"This is a cheap, functional compass. The plastic casing feels cheap, and the mirrored lid isn't connected to the base with a proper hinge, but rather the case is simply scored. It is likely that eventually the plastic there will fatigue and fail.This will work for my immediate needs, but if I could re-do my order, I'd rather spend less for a simple map compass, or spend another $10-$15 for a sighting compass that will last longer."
1,broken neck,"The Pelican is darling but the neck was broken so I called the company and they immediately sent me out a new one this one also was broken in the same area, so I would not order another one maybe the company who makes these pelicans needs to know that there is a weakness in this area."
4,Fun Toy Line,My son got this toy for Christmas. He plays with it all the time. The neatest thing about it is that there are so many other construction toys in the line that share the same detail and scale. My son is 6 and never tires of these (nearly 2 months now).
2,Breakable,This truck breaks too easily to be used by the sturdy little boys who enjoy this kind of toy.
4,Nice truck,"Bruder makes good stuff. My grandson has the dump truck and loves it so much that I bought him this one. He is thrilled. The three star durability rating is because some of the moving parts in the crane may not hold up to rough play, but so far so good."
3,Hear a sample before you buy! Please.,"I was looking for 'call to prayer' type of works from the middle east. When I was in Istanbul I enjoyed waking to the 'call to prayer' each day. Unfortunately, the gamble on this CD did not get the results I was looking for. I would recommend sampling with all the CD's in the World section unless you are familiar with them. Unfortunately, Amazon appears not to offer that service with any reliability."
3,Definitely not for New Age ambiance seekers,"This is very austere Muslim chant. Unless you really appreciate such singing, refrain from buying this cd. I think only deep faith could make it bearable for Western ears."
5,Surprisingly amazing,"It's hard to tell by the album cover, title or even the band's name but this is a stunning album, worth anyones money. Under the new name 'Finger Eleven' they have since produced three more great albums, but even the more upbeat songs somehow fail to acheive this level of enjoyability.I couldn't possibly pick a best track, it's an incredibly solid album without a single track that's likely to get skipped. Without a definite style, I really could recommend this to anyone, even if you're not overkeen on the hard rocking 'Greyest of Blue Skys' or more recent balladesque tracks from the self-titled 'Finger Eleven' album. If Finger Eleven go on to bigger things then this could become an extremely rare treasure, buy now and you won't be disappointed."
3,Not Finger Eleven,"i bought this album after purchasing finger eleven's three albums (which rock). some of the songs on this album rock: as far as i can spit, brat, spiderprints, nibber, and dropping. then, the rest of the songs are terrible. i would recommend this album for any finger eleven fan but that is it."
5,Great for ALL doshas,"Not only is this video great for all dosha types, it's also great for healing dosha-disturbance!"
5,Great DVD,This DVD has a very good approach towards Yoga. It gives you a lot of information about Dosha Yoga and Ayurvedic living. Easy to follow instructions. Would recommend this to all beginners thru to advance.
2,I really like the concept..........,"This dvd has 3 workouts each based on the doshas (pitta, vata, kapha). Since everyone is a bit different and your energy fluctuates, the idea of having different workouts to fit is great. I bought this dvd because of the concept. I viewed it and have never done it. The biggest reason for this was that the editing and cueing were flawed and I have so many wonderful yoga dvd's I just couldn't waste my time with this one. I didn't find the workouts to be as comprehensive as I like either. Also I can't really recommend this for real beginner's as the instruction is not adequate.The setting is nice with beautiful colors, but is diminished by the home movie feel which is mostly due to the editing. On the plus side there are some unusual postures not found on other dvd's that may be a good change of pace. She also incorporates some chanting which is nice. I would recommend checking this one out at the library first to see if you like it before paying for it."
3,Could have been better..,"These 3 workouts are probably good for a morning routine. However, after doing them I didn't feel like I really had a good workout. The editing was awkward and I thought that the postures weren't held long enough to really get any benefit. Try Yoga Zone for better instruction."
3,Terrible Cheap Package inside of it is Seperate Previous releases,Okay first off i was hoping for it all to be in one Blu-ray disc case in one disc not two diffrent blu-ray releases in a thin carboard type packingSalem Witch Trails:2 out of 5This film is too long for a low budget film so i lost interest after the first 30minSalvage:1 out of 5This film was cheaply made with a mis placed soundtrack littered all through out the filmMortuary:4 out of 5This is the only one good out of this set
4,Work great,These caps were easy to put on my dog's nails and work great. I bought the X-large for my 30 pound dog and the size seems to be about right. They stay on for around a month.
1,"Very, Very DIssatisfied","It has been 30 days and I still have not received my book. I am very dissatisfied with the company that shipped this order. I will never order from them again. And to be perfectly honest, it may affect my decision to order from Amazon again."
3,Interesting Book Flawed by Numerous Typos,"This book is certainly not a definitive guide to evaluating hedge funds. It focuses pretty much exclusively on a number of tools for evaluating the risks and returns of hedge funds from a quantitative perspective. It discusses and illustrates some interesting ideas such as the Hurst Index and d ratio to help us evaluate the dynamic nature of hedge fund returns. However, the book is flawed by many figures that either do not display what they are said to in the text or sometimes simply repeat the previous figure with a different number and caption, or perhaps are completely wrong. This makes the book hard to understand in parts."
5,An excellent read,"Finally a book that cuts to the chase about alternative investments! Mr. Lavinio presents a very clear perspective of alternative investments as a function of manager skill, taking a hard look at how some of the standard analytics can be misleading if not disastrous to the investor. In a time when the markets and the players begin to look more like the casinos and gamblers, this is a very handy handbook."
4,A big improvement on #3,"Each book in this series has seemed to be a little worse then the one before it, but this one broke the pattern, being far better then #3-Aenir. In this book, Tal returns to the castle which I find more intresting then the dream world of Aenir, and he and Milla split up for almost the whole book, which I was pleased with, as I don't like Milla. While Tal deals with rebelling Underfolk- Freefolk, Milla has to go back and face the Far-Raiders. It was intresting to find out more about the keystones of the castle, and to see why the series is called 'TheSeventh Tower.'"
3,Will this never end??,"I started reading book 1 when my son brought it home from school and now we have all four because they are very good and exciting but I wish that at least one of Tal and Milla's problems would be solved! So far none of the major problems in the story have come even close to being resolved and they just keep piling up. After 4 books Tal still hasn't found his father, rescued his brother, helped his mother etc... These books read like one huge book but they manage to soak you for four without even beginning to finish the story started in the first one! I'd love to know what happens next but I'm not sure I want to be socked with the neverending story and I'm afraid I don't have a bottomless pocketbook."
5,It Delivers!,"This workbook actually delivers on its promises. The book's brief description sounded good, but I relied on a customer's review for making my final selection of this book over others. I was right to do so. This book taught me more than I thought possible. The labs at the back of the book are just an added bonus. Learn and Enjoy!"
4,Good- but not for preschool,"Amazon.com has this graded as for Baby-Preschool. No way. These are fables with morals, and the vocabulary is at least second grade. I teach Third Grade and this book accompanies my reading series.There are some stories I like better than others for both content and message. (some I don't use) I'd recommend it for Second to Fifth graders."
5,Best since Aesop,Terrific childrens' ( and adults) fables. Also try Lobel's Frog and toad book for the kids. He is a terrific storyteller.
5,Fun Fables,"Arnold Lobel's ""Fables"" is a book all children seem to fall in love with. The illustrations in this copy just add to the love of these cute fables. They all, just like Aesop's, have good messages with real meanings even the youngest of children can understand and appreciate. This book is great for fun reading, or to enhance a study of fables in a language arts study. Either way, kids will want to hear/read more, and hear/read them over and over."
1,Anthropomorphic Sermons,"The problem with fables is that they are, at heart, sermons and most people don't want a sermon on a daily basis. However, if your sermon is interesting and funny and speaks to the world people see and understand, then people listening to it (or reading your fables) will not mind a little preaching. Aesop understood this, as did Jesus. I'm not so certain Arnold Lobel does. While he has a nice idea, the stories in this collection are dry and preachy and the only truly great part of the book is the wonderful illustrations, which are humorous and interesting, everything his fables aren't. If you've got a hankerin' for fables, then go to the source--Aesop. Old, but still good."
3,Dell users beware,"I purchased this unit as a cost effective universial remote. Well if your using a Axim (version 5 or 3) you will find it not to your liking. Range is extremely limited, less than 10 feet. The concept gets 5 stars but for Dell it gets only 1."
2,Short term life,"This camera worked great for about 25 pictures and then the lens got stuck and its life ended. My wife an I were disappointed about the 2 second delay of digital cameras. The quality of the pictures was extremely good, but unless we find a digital camera without the delay, we will return to our old camera."
1,try another camera,"i have a nikon cp800 now, and have used my friends fuji 2600 for 3 weeks. so, thought at 3mp this must be better than a 2600, wrong. i bought the camera and took about 50 pictures. the camera only give acceptable shots at full sunlight outdoors. the pics indoors are useless. even outdoors the camera gives lousy shots unless there is extreme bright light. i like fuji digital cameras, but they missed here. you get about the pic quality of a $$ 1mp camera. if your looking for a $ carry along camera, get the fuji 2600. my guess, half of a303 will be returned."
1,Expensive Non Standard memory,"Do yourself a favor and limit your camera search to those that use the industry standard memory format, COMPACT FLASH."
1,Unsatisfactory,"While the interface of the camera is professional looking, and the overall appearance of the camera is aesthetically pleasing, I was very disappointed with this camera. I noticed that the quality of the prints were very inferior to those taken by my friend's Nikkon Coolpix 3.2 mega pixel model. In addition, it was very hard to find a place to develop pictures, as most novice camera stores (and even some professional ones!) did not have machines that were compatible with the XD card (which by the way, costs almost double what any other memory card would cost).I accidentally dropped the camera once, and the LCD screen broke, and it no longer displayed images. Soon thereafter, the zoom broke, and the lens got stuck on the exterior of the camera. I threw it out, and got a Kodak EasyShare CX6330, which while not as aesthetically pleasing, takes much better pictures, and is far sturdier."
4,A very nice digital camera,"I really like this camera. I used it as often as possible and it was very light to carry around. I will say it takes practice to work all the modes. I took some night pictures and they weren't so great, but the other pictures I've taken are very sharp and very nice. I have used it also to talk with friends online on video and it worked very well. Does eat up regular batteries, but rechargable ones seem to last longer with the camera. If you use a high pixel mode, be aware there are fewer pictures. If you plan to take a lot of pictures and don't have access to a computer, get a bigger memory card. My only improvement would be sound on those movies! :-D"
4,GREAT!,This digital camera is great! Easy to use and understand! Beautiful pictures and great video! I love this camera.
2,Slowest. Camera. Ever,"I've had this camera for a couple years and I'm just dying to buy a new one.We went to Vegas a couple months ago and tried to take pictures of the Lions at Caesars. Here's how it works:1) Turn on camera, wait a minute for it to be ready2) Take a picture (with flash)3) Wait about 50 seconds until it's ready to take the next one.I can't believe this camera has such high ratings. Besides being horribly slow, the picture quality is hit or miss. When it's on, it's really great, but about half of the time it's ""off."""
2,Good for birthdays and trips to the zoo.,"For a point and shoot this is an ok camera. If you use the LCD mid day light will look washed out and dawn/dusk will be too dark to see anything. I often take two pictures, one with flash one without in hopes of getting something I do not have to spend an hour in photoshop correcting. Slow speed causes a lot of hand shake error-esp in low light. If you want to do more than point and shoot occasionally- save your money for another month and get a better one."
5,A sharp little number,"I was surprised at the sharpness of the pics. Colors seem to be good. I havent played with the settings much so any contrast brightness problems I can easily fix in a photo editor. I plugged it into our Macintosh G4 at work and all the photos were easily imported into iPhoto.The camera was smaller than I expected. It has no case so you may want to find one for it. My only beef is that the casing of the body is plastic instead of metal. Metal would be nice, plastic makes me nervous about how durable it will be in the long run, but hell for the price I am very happy with it."
1,LEMON,"I too bought this camera shortly before studying abroad. About halfway through my program, it stopped taking pictures altogether, even though I had never dropped it or damaged it in any way. It later started working again, but all my pictures were distorted and full of lines. I brought it into a repair shop, and they said that it would cost $175 to fix the lens alignment. Since I got it back from them, it doesn't seem to adjust to light properly, and all my pictures are too dark to see. This camera is a complete piece of junk, and I am so angry to have wasted so much money on it. Please buy a different brand, or at least get a hefty service plan with it."
1,What a headache!,"I bought this camera in June '03 while on vacation. I was so excited because it was my first digital camera, it was super easy to use, and pretty light weight. At the end of October it wouldn't upload pics on to my computer (after 3 months with no problems). I took it to the only Fuji certified shop in Southern California and it sat there for 5 weeks! I finally got it back and the problem still isn't fixed! I've been sending e-mails to Fuji with no results. I'm out just over $300 (for memory card and camera). I am terribly disappointed with the product and I wish that I had stuck with my usual favorite- Sony."
4,Great Little Camera,"This is my forth digital camera, and the best by far. My others have been HP's and have done a great job, but don't hold a candle to this one as far as res. and speed between shots. Fuji hit the mark! The zoom is smooth and the macro autofocus is right on! I just wish I would have started with Fuji in the first place."
2,NOT TO MY TASTE,IT MAKES FINE COFFEE CUP COASTER. IT KEEPS ME AWAKE! I WAN T A RELAXATION TAAPE TO HELP ME SLEEP
3,Does It Work? Maybe.,"After several listening sessions, I'm not sure if this actually works. One thing I do know is that I'd prefer a CD that I can listen to while driving-- the theory being that daily subconscious exposure to positive ""rah rah"" type thoughts would cause them to be absorbed sneakily into my mind. Harrold states at the outset that the listener must not use the CD while driving.Additionally, I find the speaker's British accent a bit offputting, as well as his use of British expressions. Finally, sometimes while he's counting five, six, seven and telling me to relax and sleep, I'll suddenly hear a loud ""EIGHT!"" which startles me out of my semi-slumber."
3,Interesting product - good idea but not completely satisfactory,I have quit reading books and doing jigsaw puzzles due to neck problems and was hoping these would solve my problem. They help to some extent. My neck is happy but the image is smaller than normal and one needs to keep the head still ... small movements are exagerated. From what I understand these were originally designed to prevent claustrophbia in an MRI. They would certainly be helpful in that situation. Negatives ... 1) they do not fit over prescription glasses. 2) they are rather heavy. I won't be using them for extended periods (like reading a novel) so they didn't fit the bill for me.
1,Disapointing!,"3/7/2000 Dr. Chuck Berg from the University of Kansas recently wrote a rave review on Ms Hagenbach after her recent jazz concert. This prompted me to buy her ""Feel The Magic"" CD without having heard it. I listened to it several times and concluded that the good Dr. and I have very different likes. The background music was fine (I know some of the players), but even there the recording was of poor quality. On some tracks, the bass was barely audible. To me the vocals sounded like a poor imitation of Sarah Vaughn. I have heard Ms Hagenbach in clubs in the early 90's where she sounded better. She should have stayed with her own style. I will sell my CD to the used CD shop for a buck."
5,Solid from start to finish,"Dallas, Texas band The Vanished was one of the brightest spots of 2004, breaking the general monotony of most of this year's releases. The Vanished picked up where Seven Channels left off - vocalist Kevin Kirkwood and guitarist Dallas Perry sound better than ever. With the addition of bassist Justin Young and drummer Phil Helms, the band released their first six-song EP in 2003, and soon found airplay on 102.1 The Edge. Although still gaining recognition beyond Texas, this up and coming band is excellent. This album marks the first ""official"" debut, adding an enhanced portion to the previous 10-song LP."
2,Not Compatible with Non-Netgear Adapters???,"Sleek design. Easy to set up -- like many other routers.Problems came when I tried to connect my two laptops, which have a built-in wireless adapter (Intel 3945ABG) and a Airlink-g card. The whole network would work for a few minites and then just freeze! Had to reset (unplug the power chord) the router to re-establish the internet connection for the attached Dell desktop computer.Tried all kinds of settings for the router and the two adapters to no avail. Happen to have a Netgear WPN111 USB adapter. Attached the WPN 111 adapter to one of the laptops, and it worked just fine!! -- Does this mean that the WPNT834 only works with Netgear adapters? If so, this Net-gear will not be reaching too far..."
5,"PC editor's choice, wireless router, no need for wireless N yet.","I bought this back in 2006 and never made a review yet, so I'll just keep it short. First off for me, I had a hard time fumbling around to get the settings to work, called tech. and got some help but not all of it. So weeks later I was so happy that everything finally worked. Can't believe I got my PS3's wirless router working quicker than this wirless router."
2,DISATISFIED CUSTOMER,"I WAS ALMOST ABOUT TO RETURN THE ITEM. IT CAME WITHOUT A SETUP/INSTRUCTIONAL DISK, AND THE PASSWORD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PRODUCT WAS SCRATCHED OUT SO THAT I HAD TO GET SOMEONE, AND PAY THAT SOMEONE, TO INSTALL THE ROUTER FOR ME--AND I AM NOT THAT COMPLETELY COMPUTER ILLITERATE! rIGHT NOW, AS I WRITE THIS REVIEW, I HAVE TO GET THE TECHNITIAN BACK IN, AND PAY HIM AGAIN, BECAUSE THE PRINTER, WHICH WAS WORKING BEFORE WIRELESSLY, IS NO LONGER DOING SO. THANKFULLY THE COMPUTERS ARE WORKING WIRELESSLY."
1,Netgear WPNT834 RangeMax 240 Wireless Router,"The Netgear Rangemax 240 shouldn't have made this product release at all. According to the reviews online, it had received high ratings compared to other wireless routers unless I am mistaken. Despite these reviews, my experience with the netgear happened to be otherwise. The connection was on and off. The signals on the wireless router indicated that the system was encountering numerous problems during that time and unable to perform its duties. It kept re-checking itself. If there was a connection, it would only last for three minutes to be exact. The desktop would not work when the laptop was in use during the three minutes. I am 100 percent sure that this shouldn't be the case. The wireless router should work together efficiently with the laptop and the desktop together.I would high suggest that you do not buy the netgear wireless router and go for another product."
1,DOA..Like most Netgear Products,"This is the 5th Netgear product I have purchased and all have died, 3 on arrivial, the rest with-in a year of purchase. I switched to Linksys and had good luck but needed more speed so I purchased this router and Guess What????? IT WAS DEAD OUT OF THE BOX, Called their great customer service, on hold for 90 minutes..have to wait week for replacement...wonder if it will work? not holding my breath. Netgear gets great reviews, just wish their stuff worked."
1,Dell tech could not get it work after 9 hours of trying,"The product was bad right out of the box according to two Dell Techs. I got premission from Amazon to return on 9-14-06, but still haven't gotten the necessary paper work from Amazon aws of today (11-05-06). It seems Amazon now wants to change horses in the middle of the stream and make me jump through hoops to return it. Bad customer service!"
3,Netgear failure,The router is not compatible with XBOX Live and the XBOX 360 Adapter. What else is there to say?
2,Good speed. Bad support. Buyers beware.,"If yours works, great. However, it may not. So I'll skip my long story and offer 3 advices:(1) Buy local. Yes I know it's more expensive.(2) Don't try ""support"" - unless you have plenty of time. Go straight to the store to get it replaced or returned.(3) SunRocket IP phone users beware. Support from both vendors are no good.It's great speed when it works."
3,Great hardware... bad software,"Router is one of the fastest available. Great for P2P (BitTorrent, Kazaa, etc) applications. Almost everything works greatThe one thing that falls very short is the wireless capability. It works great only with wireless adapters that are from the same chip manufacture (Atheros chipset). When used with any other wireless chipset you may have a very hard time.This is not a surprise as all the other manufacturers such as Linksys, Dlink, Buffalo, Belkin that use the same exact wireless chipset have same problems (probably because of horribly written drivers). Upgrading the firmware helps a lot, especially if you have an Intel-based wireless adapter.Fortunetly or not, as mentioned other brands use the same wireless chipsets so if you buy any early 802.11N (all as of 2007) most likely will run into the same problems."
2,"home office user , UK","Installation wizard straightforward. The LAN (one desktop, 3 laptops) works fine with almost the same data transfer rates as our wired network this kit replaced. Internet Access however is much, much slower (sometimes slower than dial up) and it regularly drops the connection -perhaps 3 to 4 times an hour. I am not a clueless IT user but I gave up with this one. We've had professional network engineers (added cost) in twice to try and correct the internet issues without success. With a 4meg internet connection and 240mbps kit (bought corresponding netgear cards too!) I had hoped for a seamless transition from wired to wireless. Given netgear's claims, I have to say I am very disappointed."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER!!! RUN AWAY!!!,"I have had this item for several months now. It is highly unreliable. Technical support is terrible. Documentation is worse.If you plan on using any laptops that have been built in the last year, forget about it. Anything with an Intel 3945ABG card causes the router to crash. Netgear's solution to this is to remove all security from the network and turn off all features of the wireless card. This actually helps the router stay working for about 3 minutes instead of 30 seconds.I rated this product with one star because negative stars are not an option. The only thing positive that I can say about this product is that it looks nice."
4,Most Interesting,"Placebos are far more specific than commonly believed. For me this book could've benefitted from more technical detail, but that is a matter of taste."
4,It Jams!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Forget what another reviewer said about this being the weaker of the live releases. This smokes !! It's a record that I love to play along with (on bass). Of course I play my 1968 Gibson EB-0 to get that rumbly, distorted Jack Bruce vibe and drive the neighborhood crazy on a Saturday afternoon. I prefer this over the original Live Cream. I think the track selection is much better here, especially this version of ""Politician"" which I prefer over the studio version on Wheels Of Fire."
3,Focused on content,"Having digested all the Cream albums over the years and through several stages of my own life, this album is a nice complement to its better partner ""Live Cream"". The jams are not a tight as Live Cream, but typical of what you might have heard during an actual Cream concert, i.e., not all numbers will be a ""Crossroads"".What puzzles me is the 6th track is different than my album version. Anyone else notice this?"
5,Astral Jam Session,"Cream's studio albums are classic, but the reason that these guys came together on Earth was to play live.Taped at such San Francisco area venues as Winterland, and the Oakland Coloseum in 1968, Jack, Ginger, and Clapton stretch out full force on strong live versions of ""White Room,"" ""Politician,"" ""Sunshine Of Your Love,"" and a hypnotic version of ""Tales Of Brave Ulysses.""Bruce's ""Deserted Cities Of The Heart"" is sung with intensity, and the final cut ""Steppin' Out"" is a high powered 13 minute blues jam, showcasing each member of The Cream.THe way these guys jam on their extended live cuts is full of jazz-like fluidity, bluesy rhythm, and the intensity of hard rock. And it all comes together on this disk.Clapton's solos are extraterrestrial, and Bruce's voice is in good form.Definately some of the coolest hard rock from the sixties."
4,Father & Son Berkeley make for fine 20th Ct. English Music,"This series of the music of Berkeley père et fils is a wonderful tribute to both composers, whose difference in styles is perhaps a bit jarring on volume 1, but not on this disc bringing the father's Third Symphony and Sinfonia Concertante together with the excellent Oboe Concerto and the festive ""Secret Garden"" suite of the son. Modern works, all, but more chromatically dense than atonal."
5,Last of the great CRT TV's,"I bought this used for $75 and WOW what a picture! I only buy Sony and the picture was way better than the previous non-WEGA TV that died after 10 years. The person I bought it from complained that his LCD replacement TV had an inferior picture in comparison. Great picture quality when playing DVD's using component cables. Too bad Sony TV's are either hit or miss, you either get a great one or a bad one. I lucked out and found a great one"
1,Better buy a warranty if available!,"I wish I was as lucky as some of the other reviewers. I had this TV for 3 1/2 months and one day it popped loudly and sounded like there was a static electricity battle going on inside of it. Now the color fades from picture to red and eventually turns grey with lines. I didn't get the warrenty because I used to trust Sony products. I just paid off the TV a couple of days ago and never anticipated having to make repair payments so soon. It's a decent TV, but sometimes I find myself wishing I had put down the extra cash for a real flat panel."
5,Fits the need,This product is a perfect replacement for the brush heads that originally came with the Oral B tooth brush.
4,Works fine.,"These replacement brush heads seem to work fine. Very similar to past items. Arrived as advertised.I'm curious about the more advanced versions which claim to surround each tooth and provide a flossing action, but didn't get them this time."
3,Not exactly what I thought I was getting,"These brushes arrived in an unsealed package. I was slightly grossed out by the idea that someone had physically handled my toothbrushes. The seller was very helpful however, and quickly refunded my money."
1,Thumbs down!,I will not order from this vendor again. It took almost a month to process and receive my order. Even though the product was as advertised and was in perfect condition I did not appreciate having to wait so long.
