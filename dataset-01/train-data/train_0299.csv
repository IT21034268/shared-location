3,Can't Really Say,"I have no memory of seeing this movie and it is not in my video library on Amazon.Com. I read the synopsis, and it sounds like it is at least okay. I can't recommend it. Please review this movie for yourself."
2,Too many plot holes,"This movie had great actors who all did a great a job, but the holes in the plot were very distracting. Namely, 1) How did the bad guys know the girl had a six-digit number in her head that they needed? Weren't they in jail after the subway incident? 2) How did they install all those cameras everywhere? 3) Wouldn't the drugs the doctors were giving the girl have incapacitated her at least a little? 4) What did those bodies they found floating have to do with anything? 5) Why was the deadline 5 o'clock? What was so urgent about them getting that number after they had waited 10 years? If anyone has any insight, please share!"
4,Pedestrian yet Creepy tale works well on DVD,"This is yet another suspense vehicle for Michael Douglas. Douglas is starting to look tired in this one but these types of roles seem to fit him perfectly just the same. The plot is not all that bad even though it gets predictable along the way. The film somehow remains interesting based in part to the strong performances by the main cast. Brittany Murphy turns in a good performance as the institutionalized teenager from whom psychiatrist Douglas must extract information to get his own daughter back from bad guy Sean Bean. Thus, the film acts as both a thriller and a mystery. The finale is very good and very unsuspected considering the previous settings. From a visual perspective the finale is quite creepy and curiously resembles the Halloween genre, but is very well done and very effective. I enjoyed this film much better on DVD than when I saw it in the movie complex."
3,Clever premise poorly executed,"Don't Say A Word starts off very nicely but lets you know the first time someone pops out of a closet, exactly what you're in for the rest of the way. Michael Douglas is a great actor and does his best to redeem a film that turns into a rehash of Hitchcock's Frantic crossed with Johnny Depp's Nick of Time. But in the end the film resorts to every silly hollywood convention possible. My personal favorite being the one legged mom that miraculously manages to beat up a professional assasin. But sadly thats not the end of the implausible plot points. Three quarters of the way through this movie you'll be telling the person next to you whats going to happen next, even if you're not normally inclined to this sort of annoying behavior.If you just want something to watch on HBO some night then go for it, but if you buy this DVD and find yourself putting it up on ebay the next day, don't say I didn't warn you."
2,"Okay, for a Friday night flick.","2.5 stars. 'Don't Say A Word', is OK if you are home on a Friday night with nothing to do or you want to be mildly entertained for two hrs. If not, you won't like this. It has no real surprises and the plot is that of the usual Hollywood fair. Mr. Douglas does a fine job. Mr. Platt is good, yet his character isn't involved through the whole film. His character just ""dissapeares"", midway. The villians are regrettably forgettable. Details to plot and character developement are important in a film; especially one like 'Don't Say A Word'. The acting, production and direction are fair. Overall, it's a good film. It may be better with popcorn and some tasty beverage."
3,Usual,"This is your usual band of hoods needs something from somebody flick. The storyline kind of plays out like the way a City Transit Bus operates: it may take different routes, but in the end it always ends up in the same place. The movie was still watchable, but to drag a movie of this manner into a two hour flick is a bit of a stretch. Michael Douglas spends his days trying to get information out of a traumatized little girl's head. If he doesn't, then the band of hoods will kill his daughter. I have a question, ""does the daughter ever get killed"". I'm just saying, the children are either killed at the beginning of the movie or taken hostage. I just want something different just one time. Anyway, there is one thing I like about the movie and we all know what that is....""I'll never tell."" Classic one-liner. This movie gets a C from me. Don't buy the DVD, you'll probably only watch it once."
2,"Please, Don't say a word!","Jeers to the most dullest movie of 2001, Don't say a word. This suspenseless thriller doesn't surprise you and you don't really have feelings for any of the charactors and the plot line was awful(especially the stupidest ending ever!) Don't say a word was disappointing, and pointless at the same time. Though Micheal Douglas gave a great performace(only one that tried to bring this sinker afloat),but I belive he was more in for the money."
1,Another movie about the upper class fighting crime,"This is just another boring movie about a rich guy who takes a bite out of crime. He and his wife use their superior intellect to beat the bad guys.Off course, 99 percent of the police play only a minor part, showing up at the end to carry the dead bodies away.This plot has been done before a million times. This is not an interesting movie."
1,Yawn-o-Rific,"It never fails I fall for the hype that some movie is good and different and it ends up being the same old same old. In the orginal trailer it kept showing the girl saying ""I'll never tell"", which became the unofficial tag line of this movie. It was annoying then and even more so now. Michael Douglas plays a well worn piece of leather as usual, Famke Jansen is one redeeming factor though, but I would watch her making coffee that is just me. Anyway Sean Bean is playing the villian again which he is good at but he is somewhat wasted here. I guess this movie is a passable waste of time if you have nothing better to do. I give 1 and 1/2 leatherfaces out of 5."
2,"Simple plot, no twists, lots of suspense music","2 of 5 stars for the suspense movie ""Don't Say a Word"". Very simple plot, no plot twists, lots of suspense and a long movie with little contents. The story is simple, some nutcases want to extract a magic number that a girl has in her memory. The girl has been a mental patient most of her life. So, they kidnap the daughter of her shrink and demand he extract the number from the patient. From there it is a straight forward kidnapping recovery story.Darkly photographed, lots of heavy stringed music to add a suspense edge to the movie. Well acted by Michael Douglas. But, not much reward for sitting thru the movie. No twists. You don't even really find any value from the magic number.You can skip this movie."
4,Great Thriller!,"This movie is by itself a great thriller and well worth the viewing. While some have complained about 'unoriginality' I have to say, come on, originality?After past half century of movie making most themes have been heavily used the only thing that counts is making it fresh, making us want to watch it, and this movie did that. It gave us new twists, interesting scenes, and great acting notably by Sean Bean who was a brilliant villian and overall priceless addition to the movie."
4,A fun thriller,"The first time I watched ""don't say a word"" I didn't realy like it. then I went out and rented it again and thought it was great. The second time around I noticed things that I didn't notice the first time. This led me to understand and appreciate the movie. Don't say a word is a clever thriller with a great cast and stylish directing. It did seem a little bit riddiculous at times, but it had some clever plot twists. Overall ""Don't say a word is a winner.""SCOREOVERALL: 88/100 BPLOT: 17/20 BCAST: 18/20 A-DIRECTION 17/20 BFUN: 18/20 A-Special Effects: 18/20 A-CONTENTVIOLENCE: 6SEX: 3LANGUAGE: 7Rated ""R"" for Intense Violence and Language"
2,This was a Thriller?!?,Too predictable...in a bad way. This film was not thrilling or mysterious at all. Douglas did a good job as always and Murphy was quite good and cute...as always. :) Other than that...VERY weak movie. The trailer was better than the film.
5,"Absolutely amazing and intriguing, and not gory","This movie is wonderfully written and isn't overly disgusting like many thrillers nowadays are.Michael Douglas plays a prominent New York City adolescent psychiatrist who has abandoned his older hospital roots for the 'practice' life. While on his way home for Thanksgiving holidays, a former colleague pages him to mee Elisabeth (Brittany Murphy), a very difficult and disturbed patient.Unfortunately, when he becomes involved with Elisabeth's case, he also puts his own life in danger. His daughter is kidnapped by people with ties to Elisabeth's 'insanity' on Thanksgiving morning. Unless he gets a six-digit number out of the depths of Elisabeth's mind, his daughter will die. As he gets more and more involved in the case, you can see that he actually cares about Elisabeth's well-being.This is definitely worth seeing. The storyline is awesome and isn't as confusing as some of the promos seem to make it out to be."
4,RECOMMENDED,"I rented this movie expecting to hate it. Instead this movie surprised me with a good plot, good acting and ended up being a good movie. This movie makes an evening fly by, highly recommend."
4,Watch Brittany Murphy for Future,"The #1 reason for watching this movie is discovering young actress Brittany Murphy who is outstanding as Michael Douglas's psychiatric patient. In order to save his own daughter's life, Douglas must discover a number that is locked inside this patient's brain. That number will lead to the recovery of a fabulous jewel. Douglas's and Murphy's scenes together are all terrific. The rest of the movie is a rather conventional Hollywood thriller about good guy Douglas sweating bullets under the demands of bad guy Sean Bean and how Douglas will save the day and triumph over Bean. It's a night's entertainment and I enjoyed it. I can't imagine wanting to own my own copy though."
4,Typical Thriller,"Ok, I'll admit, I went and saw this because Sean Bean was in it. I was disappionted by Sean's acting in the least, he was the perfect evil villian. The rest of the movie was not as good. A typical plot with the typical ending was well done, but nothing spectacular. Brittany Murphy was excellent in her role as the phsyco patient whose past is haunting her. Michael Douglas was definatly not outstanding. But all in all, the movie was not that bad."
3,"week plot, some good acting","I really have mixed emotions about this film.The plot itself wont win any originality awards but the acting of Brittany Murphy was a nice suprise as was Michael Douglas.Douglas who plays a 200.00 dollar an hour shrink who needs to extract a number from a catatonic patient, and needs to do it by 5pm, so the bad guy can get home for dinner.Why 5? why not 5:30? Although many of the scenes of this movie were boring and not very suspensful i enjoyed the acting of the very talented Brittany Murphy as well as Gary Fleder.I would personally rate this movie a 6.5/10.Not very well construted but somewhat entertaining never the less...."
2,Don't say a word? Dont expect much,"Conceptually, this movie is fantastic: To save his kidnapped daughter, a child psychologist must pry a sequence of numbers from the mind of a seemingly psychotic and thoroughly overmedicated and messed up young girl.Notice I said ""conceptually."" Keep reading my review.Based on this premise, what I was expected was tense drama and suspense as Michael Douglas attempts to forge a bond with the girl to unlock the mysteries of her past and convince her to reveal her secrets. What I got was completely unrealistic--the girl's trust solidified in a matter of moments, leading to a completely predictable, formulaic conclusion.Come on. The only time people open up like that is when they're on Jerry Springer. Had I known that this movie was directed by the same director that ruined the book, ""Kiss The Girls"", I may not have rented it at all.Conclusion: If you're curious, rent it. This is not something with a lot of playback appeal."
2,Really no big deal...,"Once again, Michael Douglas mantained his reputation intact after such not so good movie, due to his unbeliavable capacity of good acting.But the plot is really weak. Even Sean, who had portrayed a lot of other bad guys, could not give a convincing performance!Well, it's not a total waste of time, but I assure you there are hundreds of better options when you chose to buy / rent a film."
2,Somebody turn on a light!,"Because this movie was so dark, we couldn't see what was happening at the big suspense ending."
2,Dissapointing,"Isn't this movie suppose to be a thriller? I don't think so. Far from it. The script is very weak and predictable. Brittney Murphy gave a mild performance, and Michael Douglas was dissapointing as the script.I was not on the edge of my seat in this movie and did I also mention the score wasn't put together well at all.This was one of the most dissapointing films of the year."
2,Don't Say A Word,"The title of this movie says it best: DON'T SAY A WORDTo see this movie too many times is just once,If you can't figure it out in the opening scene you're a dunce!No substance - just fluff... POOF!"
4,interesting story,"Don't Say a Word is a very interesting movie. Suspenseful with a good storyline that keeps you going through the movie. Famke Jansen is wonderful, and so is Brittany Murphy (she plays psycho so well!) The DVD version has so many wonderful extras....full-length commentary by the director Gary Fleder, and commentary by the actors on specific scenes. Murphy's test screen is enlightening for such a young actress. A few deleted scenes are added, and some other features about location and storyboards. For the entire movie experience get the DVD and watch the extras after, it's really worth it."
2,Intriguing story marred by typical Hollywood hokum,"The story is certainly intriguing enough, and I'll agree with the Amazon reviewer that that makes it suitable for 'rainy day viewing'. Unfortunately, it's too bad that the filmmakers seem so enamored with their own technique that they simply have to pile on one cliche after another: slow-motion flashbacks, cute kids that are unusually smart, tinkling piano music to remind us that it's a tender family moment, bedridden wives that suddenly turn into Linda Hamilton in ""The Terminator"". On top of that, we've got Jennifer Esposito pretending to be a tough cop and Michael Douglas wearing more makeup than usual. The whole thing almost begs for someone like Leslie Nielson to come in full Airplane mode and spout ""I am serious - and stop calling me surely"". Underneath all this is probably the makings of a potentially interesting story, one that ocassionally reveals itself when you least expect it. Otherwise, this is pretty routine affair."
5,Font say a word,"Brittnay Murphy was intense in this movie. Very suspensful the entire movie, certainly worth watching. I ordered this movie to add to my collection of DVD's. I would recommend this to everyone."
3,Stylish for the $$ you spend,"Stylish for the $$ you spend - different colors for different occasions, great for the price. But plastic feeling may be worry you"
5,Great Little CD Player!,An inexpensive way to carry my music. Love the red color and it works really well. Have not used the radio.
1,didnt work,the cd player didnt work but again the ups did pick up within one day of my emailing. The service is excellent but unfortunately the cds didnt work in the player
1,stopped working after 3 months,"I bought this CD player for my baby so that she can listen to music while she's sleeping. This CD player stopped working after 3 months of daily use about 4-6 hours a day. I guess you get what you paid for, cheap price for a cheap brand...it's like getting a ""disposable CD player"" well I guess I'll keep it for the radio. Will not buy any Coby brands, this will be the last purchase."
1,It doesn't work!!!,"Hi, Let me begin this review with saying that I liked this product for being portable, good looking and sound quality. My main purpose of using this was to listen the cd's and it did well on it for few months. Yesterday it just didnt play any CD (it's being almost 4 months since I owned it). Now I dont know what to do with it!! I am writing this review in a hope that coby sends me a replacement for this one."
1,Doesn't play CDs,"Tried several CDs with this model and none of them worked. The CD was spinning, and the display just said ""No"". Radio worked fine. Sending it back for a refund."
2,Good sound but...dangerous!,"Our kids love falling asleep listening to audio books which is why we bought this device.We looked for a cheep but known brand and COBY is one of those.It worked really well for almost 6 months, good sound quality and all but then -one day, we smelled this terrible smell of burnt plastic and realized that the device is heating up to a level of internal melting.It's not operational anymore, completely gone and with the 3-months warranty, nothing much we can do about it.Beyond the sad ending this could have ended much worst - we consider this device dangerous and don't plan on buying it again."
3,Hummm,"Pro:1. Tiny2. Tiny3. Cute4. Decent radio reception even with very short antennaCon:1. Puny sound (but it's a tiny, inexpensive stereo...)2. IT HUMS. In radio or CD mode, there is a moderate/low pitched hummming sound that comes through the music. Even when you're not playing a CD, there's the hum. I thought it was just me, since I'm very sensitive to hums, but my wife (who doesn't care) noticed it, too, without my pointing it out.I MAY keep this boombox because it's cheap and cute, but the hum really does irritate me."
4,Coby CD Player,Decent for the price. Good radio rception. Volume seems a bit lower than I would like. Overall grade B.
1,Broken,Sadly we received the product broken. It wouldn't play beyond the half way mark of any cd. In requesting a replacement the company returned the money without any comunication. It was rather strange but they refunded the money so one cant't complain.
1,Junk,"I purchased this cd player as a gift for someone, and the cd player didn't work either! Very disappointing...Do not purchase this product."
4,Great for the Kitchen,"I was looking for a small, colorful radio/CD player for my kitchen area. This beautiful red radio/CD player matches my appliances and is small enough to fit nicely in my kitchen. I am very pleased with it's appearance and the quality of it's performance."
1,Total junk,"Couldn't receive radio signals clearly. Tuning and volume controls are on the back of the unit. While it look nice, it is completely useless. I returned mine while I still could and will try another brand."
5,Very nice,The perfect birthday gift for my sister who is in between moving and did not have her packed away stereo to use. She was thrilled with the product.
4,good for kids,I got this for my 8 year olds birthday. It's perfect for her room and plays loud enough for me to shut her door. She loves it. It's nice and portable too.
3,radio fuzzy,I like the CD player but the radio always goes off station and is fuzzy. Also there is a hum when nothing is on but it is plugged in.
1,Dont Buy It!!!!!!,"I opened this and while it is small and compact (which is why I opurchased it)it only worked once. I opened it up and set it up in my daugther's room. I played her baby music cd on it one afternoon and it worked fine. the next day when I went to put it on for her again it did not work. The cd screen lit up but it would not turn the CD and there was no sound for the radio either. Both my husband and I looked it over time and time agian to make sure we hadn't missed something, but we could get it to work. And on top of it all I had it working once so I through out all the packaging and can't even return it. A waste of time and money. I wish I had listened to the bad reviews this product already had."
1,Product died after 10 months,"I bought this CD player because it was cheap and compact. The CD player stopped playing CD's after just 10 months. This is my first and last time buying a COBY product. Learn from my mistake, pay the few extra bucks to buy a product that lasts longer."
2,Not a good buy,"I bought this CD payer for my granddaughter for Christmas and by February it is not working. (She is an infant, so only operated by her parents). Of course the window for return ended January 31.Not sure I would by electronics online again. Easier to return to the store."
2,Do NOT waste your money!,"I loved the look of this player and the price seemed reasonable. So I happily took my new little red cd player home to learn that it doesn't play burned cds at all and it skips like crazy! I went out and got a new cd since I couldn't use the music I already had and it worked for about a month before it completely gave out on me. Again, it's a nice looking little player but don't be deceived or you'll be on here a month from now looking for a new player like I am right now."
1,"Waste of money, CHEAP",I purchased 2 of these for my children's bedrooms. BOth of them went out after about 6-8 weeks. No wonder they were so cheap.
1,bad quality and awful customer service,"CD player stopped working within a month. We only used it to play a couple of brand new CDs. We never dropped it. We never carried it with us. It stood the whole time on a side table in a bedroom. I e-mailed Coby customer services, they never got back to me. I called. No answer. I e-mailed again. Silence. I wish I didn't waste my time and just returned it to amazon right away. I will never buy Coby product ever again. They don't deserve our business."
1,A Piece of Junk!!,"I'm a teacher who bought this for my Sensory Room. I have had it for a month and have had nothing but trouble with it. The antenna broke off the second day when I was trying to tune in the radio. The CD player would work for a few songs and then would just start skipping. Today, the CD player quit altogether. I don't even want a replacement, just my money back. Don't buy it!!"
1,bad quality,the radio reception is bad and does not play mp3 . the reason i purchase this was to play mp3 . this product sits inside my closet .
4,Great for the price,This is used nightly at the Grandparents house for music. It has held up well and still plays CDs a year later. This is my second purchase. The first player only lasted about 6months of continuous use.
4,CD Player w/radio,"I have not yet used the CD player, but the portable radio was a lifesaver during the September hurricane when we lost all power. I'm very glad I bought it; it arrived well before the specified arrival date."
3,"Not the best quality, but it's hanging in there","It's hard to find small CD players for my kids' bedrooms (I refuse to buy 2, 4 and 6 year olds their own iPods), so I bought this one after burning through another brand player in just a couple months. It didn't take long for it to start acting up, but I found out that giving it a good, solid bop with the side of my fist works wonders. I've been punching this thing every night for almost 2 years, and it still plays. That's somewhat impressive."
1,Piece of crap - don't buy it,"I purchased this for my daughter's room. She's been using it for 2.5 months and the CD player is ALREADY broken. And because I bought it in advance of her birthday, I'm past the window to return it. Do not buy this piece of crap CD player. Total rip-off."
1,Junk,"This product didn't last long, stopped playing CDs had to toss it. It had poor sound quality when it actually worked."
1,CD Player did not work out of the box.,Daughter open present for Christmas and Plugged it in and check the radio and it work. Try to play cd and it would just spin and would not play. Sent it back for refund.
1,CD Player Does Not Work,"I have the blue player. Pretty color. I use it in my office, but not everyday. I must have used the CD player maybe 4 times and now it does not work. So I can only use the radio now."
2,No Sound,I just wanted a cheap cd player so we could play cds for my 6 month old daughter. After only a few days the sound just stopped working. The cd player still worked as far as I could tell (the numbers lit up on the screen and changed like it was going through the songs)but no sound. I put in a return request through amazon and they immediately sent me a replacement. I just received the new one and so far its working fine. Im just worried this one is going to break as well after seeing all the other bad reviews for this product.
1,don't waste your money,"For about $23, you get the same one with same price at walmart, cheap it is. the first time i opened it and put a cd in, it ate up my cd. created a lot of scratches and wasn't playing the songs right. even my 3 year old was asking, ""what's wrong, mom?"" so, i removed the cd and placed it back in, it sometimes play a bit, but the sound quality is poor. then sometimes you can't even hear the words of the song. so sad, what a waste of money this was. quickly returned it to the store."
1,Worked for less than 4 weeks.,"Great size, easy to use...only worked for a few weeks. I bought it to use in my baby's room, and this has a repeat function which is what I was looking for. First, it started skipping,then it would stop completely and give an error message (it didn't come with a manual, so I didn't know what it meant). Then, it died. Piece of crap. I returned it for a refund."
1,Already broken~,I don't know how? It's already broken...sad...I only used one to two months.When I want to return is over 30 days. So
2,"Worked well for 2 weeks, started skipping cd's","It is dissapointment, had it for 2 weeks. Playing fine, then last week the CD's (New ones) started to skip all over the place. I tried restarting it and put another CD in. Played first 2 tracks, then it started skipping again. But you know what they say ""You get what you pay for"". Dissapointed because this CD was just the right size. One plus, it pick up radio stations well and good sound."
2,Worked well... for 2 months.,"Worked as it should for 2 months before not reading the disc. Radio works just fine, though. Should've listened to other reviewers' advice and not purchased. Waste of money."
1,Absolute Junk,CD player stopped working within weeks. While this is a lower priced item our expectations were higher. I wouldn't even give it 1 star. Don't waste your $ on this- you really dont even get what you pay for.
1,Absolutely horrible!,This is a terrible product! I bought this recently July 2011. It will no longer play cd's after three weeks. I purchased this for my baby's room to play a white noise cd so I am the only one that has touched it. It made a funny noise after two weeks and completely broke after three. Also...on the instruction booklet there are warnings everywhere re: power cord made with lead base and radiation emitting from cd player. This may be true with other electronics but i do not recollect seeing such warnings on my other things. The company will not give me a refund since i purchased this via amazon. I am just going to throw it in the trash. Good thing it was only twenty bucks. I guess you get what you pay for!
3,"Cheap sound, but cheap price","Bought this to put in my 2-year old's room for playing lullaby CDs.It's been working reliably for almost a year now and is used every night.Sound is tinny and thin; exactly what I expected for such an inexpensive unit.I have no complaints, however, since it's simple, reliable and puts my son to sleep. :)"
1,Don't buy this CD player,"Purchased on July 9, 2011...it worked less than 30 days....CD won't play anymore, with the player not recognizing it...must pay $10 shipping fee to return and get a replacement. Paying $10 on top of the original purchase price to get a replacement CD player for my brand new CD player! I might consider this IF I felt it was a fluke, but in reading the reviews I'm afraid it's not (my husband purchased this one without carefully reading the negative feedback). I kindly suggested they offer me a credit and I could look at other products in the COBY family. That was denied so I guess I'm stuck with a radio/CD player which doesn't play CD's and writing COBY a negative review for their poor customer service."
4,Great CD Player,This CD Player/AM/FM radio from Amazon works fine. Good tone and volume. It is exactly what I needed. I have no issues with this item and would recommend it to anyone needing such a system.
1,What a waste,"I bought this to get a cheap cd player, instead I got a non-functioning cd player. Thanks for wasting my time, money, and energy."
2,CD Player Broken within 12 months,"The Pros: Great looking, small and compact, easy to use, radio still worksThe Cons: CD player worked fine and then suddenly refused to play anything. If you're looking for a player to use just few times, then I guess this is a good deal. I however would expect to own this player for more than 12 months. It broke almost exactly 12 months from the date of purchase. The player was gently used and still ""looks"" like new. Too bad the CD player is so poorly made."
1,Don't buy it.,"Bought it 10/ll. Worked fine till 3/12. Now it either won't play at all or it will play 2-3 cuts, then die. I've used a disk cleaner and cleaned my disks with water and a sponge. It doesn't help. Their troubleshooting guide suggested that maybe moisture is the problem so leave it on for 2-3 hours to dry it out. Did that. Didn't work. Called them and they said ship it back to them with a money order (not a check) for $10. By the time I get it packaged and ship it, I could buy a new one. Aside from that, it doesn't remember where you last stopped so you have to search for it. (I listen to some audio books, not just music.) That's not easy because you can only go forward one cut at a time---there's no slow fast forward. The volume control is on the back of the unit which is also inconvenient, especially if you use it in a dark room. Moral: Look elsewhere."
1,Gave up on this POS!!,"Update: donated to the local homeless shelter. Got the SONY ZSE5RED. Buy SONY quality.Bought this to listen to audiobook on CD, so I don't have to fire up the stereo system, and sound is more than adequate and radio works fine at least for AM + FM. I don't see why anyone has to pay extra for the cord, and the CD does have a mind of its own, but I found that sometimes you need to tilt it up or sideways to get it spinning and then hit play again, and once it starts to play, its fine. You'll get the hang of it if you're a little patient, unless you're a toddler."
2,Cute but non-functional,This little unit was perfect for the space needed but didn't recognize any of the CD's I placed in it. Something's off since there are other reviewers who have said the same thing. I would think Amazon would stop selling something that was dysfunctional for so many users. The plus side was an instant refund from Amazon. I was able to find something similar although more $$$ at a local Target.
1,does not work,"ordered this item a month ago or so to use in the nursery. I tried the radio and it worked fine, but I just found out that it will not play any of the CDs I tried. I will try to return for a refund."
1,Rip-Off!! Does NOT work!,I bought this as birthday gift for 9 yr old grandson. It refuses to play CD's!! I cannot return it because box was thrown away with party clean-up. I am so mad - and grandson was very disappointed! Do NOT buy this! It is junk!
2,Not great buy,"My daughter received this as a gift and it worked for over a year. Then the CD's would spin and spin without playing. It kept skipping too. It's too bad because it's cute and compact in design. Between my experience and other reviews on this product, it seems that it's not a good buy."
1,NO REFUND,I returned this item and I am still waiting for a refund. It has been almost 4 weeks and I can't get a hold of the seller.Frustrating!!!
3,good while it lasted,Bought this for my 1 year old daughters room and used it a couple hours once a week. It last less than a year before the CD player stop reading the disc. It was easy to use and good sound quality. Hate it died so soon.
2,Died after 1 year,"I tend not to buy cheap electronics, but purchased this from buy.com for about $30 on 10/12/2009. Well, it is 10/24/10, and the CD player and the MP3 USB input are both dead. The USB input was the first to go, maybe 6 months into its life. Now, it won't read CD's. I guess the radio still works.Pretty useless, spends an extra $35 and get at least 2 or more years out of a Sony product. Oh, the COBY warranty is only 90 days!!BWP"
2,Disappointed,"Colby CX-CD241 Portable CD player and RadioAlready there are hitches in disc play despite all attempts to rectify,. The radio qualityu is mediocre. The antenna broke off with a single turn without force. I would not buy again from this accompany, feeling fleeced and disappointed, and would nbot reccommend the product. If I had the time to waste on warranty stuff, I would seek and expect reparation; it is of very limited use"
1,Junk!,"I bought this for my newborn's room, used only a few times, lasted less than a month. Called Coby, customer service rep was very rude!! Called back to speak w/a manager, was on hold for over 15 minutes so I hung up!! Will never buy their products!!"
1,DONOT BUY THIS CD PLAYER,I got this CD player two months back and the play and repeat buttons are not working any more. I can't use it any more. Even though it is cheap it is not worth even that much. Try to find another decent CD player. I am not at all satisfied with this.
3,Convenient and cheap...,"I got one of these stereos to use in my office when I'm working at the computer. I've been using it for nearly a year, and haven't had any technical problems with it. I think the sound is just fine for such a small stereo. The compact size makes it perfect to set on a desk, and the CD player has basic functions like repeat and random play. It doesn't have a search function which I miss from time to time, but listening to songs from beginning to end has its merits. It can skip to the next song. I think the CD player is fine.I haven't been completely happy with the radio. I normally listen to CDs, but sometimes I like to catch a ball game on the radio. The station that broadcasts our games has a strong signal, and I picked it up fine on my old radio. This one sometimes has trouble holding on the station.All in all, this isn't a bad stereo for the price. It's little enough to fit almost anywhere and functions just fine. I've been happy with it."
1,Very Disappointed!,I ordered this CD player to play bedtime stories and music for my children. We used it once a day for less than two months and it broke. I wrote to the manufacturer who refused to respond. I would not buy this brand again.
1,Lasted 3 months,We play a cd in our daughter's room every night on repeat. This cd player had gotten questionable reviews but I went ahead with it. Big mistake. Lasted 3 months before the cd player burned out. We have an Insignia cd player that has lasted more than 1.5 yrs playing in another room. Shame on me for buying a cheaper one.
3,Coby CD Player,I like that is small. I also like that it is light. What I do not like is that it does not play loud enough.
1,a very bad product,"I have bought four of these players the first two lasted a few months the third one lasted a month and the last one lasted a week. I will never buy another one because it is a piece of junk.My advise to new buyers don't buy it you will be dissapointed.I gave it one star because I had no other choice, if it was up to me I will give it a big fat zero."
2,Okay at First,I bought this to sit on my daughters dresser and play her classical music at night. I have gone through 3 Of these Boombox's. They work good at first but after a little bit they just stop working. They won't play any CD's I put in. I am now to the point of frustrated and I will never buy this CD player again.
1,Absolute Garbage,"Beware the warranty. You've got only 90 days. Within that 90 days, you pay to ship to Coby (it came out to $12 for me) and a $6 for Coby to ship back to you. In all, you pay more to get this garbage serviced than you pay upfront. This is the case for all Coby products. Check Coby USA's site for the bad news on warranty costs.Save yourself some time money and spend the extra $10 to get a good product from a reputable brand, with a regular 1-year warranty, and not this crapola-knock-off garbage."
1,Do not buy!,"I purchased this product 2 times! The first CD player worked for about a month and quit playing CD""s. I returned and recieved a 2nd CD player-lo & behold this one quit working within 2 weeks! I foolishly thought ""I'll just get another CD player-could not happen twice! So..at this point I cannot return, I did not send back the 2nd. CD player within a month. (Family emergency) Now who wants a:Coby CX-CD241 Portable CD Player with AM/FM Stereo Tuner, Black-that does not play CDs.Just for your information, I am not rough, or abuse the products, I have listened to books on CD for years-so this was very surprising to say the least.Thank you for letting me vent!Sincerely,Lari Nickens"
3,Radio,Reception isn't the greatest and hard to pin point a channel. Bought for the office and hardly ever use it
3,It dose the trick,"the sound seams to be a little week...The antenna is also in an inconvenient place, and got busted off really soon after I received it.."
1,Do not waste your money,"I purchased this item to use for one purpose, to play cds for our baby during bedtime. We kept one cd in the player, and rarely ever changed it out. I mention this to highlight the fact that the player did not undergo a constant changing out of cds or pressing of various buttons. Despite this,the player stopped playing cds after three months. It was kept in a stationary position, used only once a day in the evening and yet it did not hold up. The speaker quality was average at best. It now sits in the garage gathering dust, and will most likely be tossed out with the garbage."
2,Wasted Money,"I bought this for my 6 year old son for Christmas last year. I didn't want to spend too much since he is so young. Holy guacamole...what a waste of money. For $10 more I could have gotten something that worked. The radio capabilities are abysmal. Not one radio station comes in clearly. I have no idea why this is as we live in the city and our signals are strong. The sound quality for the cd player is poor, but at least it doesn't sound like the speakers are blown. The antenna broke off within the first 2 months. Partly because we couldn't get any reception so the antenna was moved frequently. I do like the shuffle, repeat. All in all you'd be better off spending a few more dollars. We're tossing this and getting him a new one for Christmas."
1,Coby CX-CD241 Portable CD Player w/ radio,Very disappointed with the sound quality. (Am not a fussy sound quality person.) The footprint is also very large. The price was excellent but not worth it. I purchased it to listen to audio books.
4,"For what it is, it works well","This is an economy item - no, it won't have the best sound quality, and if you're not careful with it it will break down quickly. For the price though, it works well and has a decent amount of features. Audiophiles, look higher in the price range, but for people just looking for a radio for the garage or whatnot this works well."
4,It works!,"After reading a number of negative reviews of this product, I was very pleased to find that the CD/radio works quite well and provides the background music I want for my Title I Reading Groups.I'm glad the price was right and I purchased it."
1,Too good to be true,"Great looking product at a fantastic price... but, sound quality is just 'ok', and, when in 'CD' mode, it has an annoying hum if nothing is playing or if the volume is low. Also - my 19 month old son was able to snap the antenna off in a matter of seconds... you get what you pay for! I am extremely disappointed & will not be buying another Coby anytime soon!"
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"We received the item in a timely fashion...that was the only plus...We called the vendor. We were told that we could not receive a refund...If we wanted to have the item inspected, return it on our dime plus send them a $6 money order, no check,and they will consider what they might do...After the 10 minute lecture we decided what we will do. THE ITEM IN QUESTION IS NOW SLEEPING WITH THE FISH. This is thefirst failure of Amazon. ""fool me once, shame on me...fool me twice............"
5,PERFECT FOR NURSURY,"I bought this for my one year old to use in her bed room. I wanted something that would simply play CDs - nothing more, nothing less. And for that - it is perfect! It was inexpensive, so if it gets ruined - I won't care. I have not tried to use the radio on it, so I can not comment on how well the radio works."
2,Disappointed,"Sadly the antennae on this broke within 2 weeks. It never had extreme wear, it just fell off.It ran through batteries quickly. The only way we could use it was being plugged into the wall, which kind of defeats the point of purchasing a portable radio.I ended up giving it to my daughter to play CDs on for which it works alright. The sound is decent.Wouldn't buy again. I would spend a bit more and purchase something higher quality."
1,You get what you pay for,I didn't want to pay a lot for a CD player and got what I deserved - a CD player that didn't work well from the start until it finally started skipping so much I could no longer use it --- just 5 days after purchase!!I learned my lesson and got a CD player for twice the price. So far so good.
2,Poor sound quality,"I purchased this because it was cute and little, perfect for my daughter's bedroom. I RETURNED this because it had very little volume control and the sound quality was AWFUL."
2,"Cheap feel, tin sound, not loud.","I was not impressed with this CD player. It has a tinny sound to it and the volume is limited. Would not be good for the outdoors, where I bought it for. The CD player skips, so I know this is a defective unit thus far. The radio reception is also sub-par. Some of the markings (decals) are rubbed off and the unit had some scratches on it like it was a return or refurb. Will most likely return it to Amazon."
1,Doesn't work,It's hard to review something that doesn't work.It never has and it now has a new home in the recycling plant.Thanks COBY!!!
1,Never Again!!,"I was only able to use the CD player once, and could never get it to work after that, then I started having trouble with the radio and finally threw it away!! I wil NEVER order electronics off the internet again!!!"
1,Portable CD Player,The CD Portable player broke after having it for 2 months. CDs do not play anymore. Had to throw it out...Waste of a electronics.
1,Bad lil' investment in music playing,"Purchased in February, started skipping cd's in April. Gets really hot and the disc under the lid is loose. Can't return now due to Amazon's short return window! One star because the FM radio plays. Considering I only play cd's at night, this was a waste of money, time."
1,Do not buy!!!,"Purchased two CXCD240 units for my boys for Christmas. Within 6 months, BOTH have battery corrosion- ruining spots on our carpet. Both had Duracell batteries and Coby refused to accept responsibility and replace units."
2,Coby CX-CD241 Radio,This radio just don't work for me it plays but don't come in clear at work. I gave it to a friend for her to take on vacation with her.
3,Don't expect too much...,I bought this to put in my 1-year-old daughter's room because it is small and the color matched. The first one we received had to be sent back because the CD player didn't work! The second one we were sent came immediately and works just fine. This is a great product if you just want to play children's music in a child's room. I would not recommend it for many other uses.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I never leave reviews because I'm usually very happy or at least satisfied with things I purchase, however, this item is really a waste of money for what I needed it for. I purchased it for my 5 year old so that he can carrying it around and listen to his cd's. The cd player does not work well if I can get it to work at all. I have to slam the cd door several times for it to turn on and sometimes, I just give up. Unfortunately, with my busy schedule, I did not have time to return it so we just use it to listen to the radio...a waste since he already has a larger radio."
1,Listen to the reviews,"i ignored the reviews that stated this portable cd player was a piece of junk. Well, surprise, surprise.....it is a piece of junk. Broke about 5 min. after i unpacked it! Played three songs on a cd and I heard a pop sound and the smell of an electrical fire. YES, I said electrical fire! I should have known something was up because before each song played, it made a honking sound. Thought it was the CD, but apparently not.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME and MONEY!"
1,Awful,"Now that I've looked through all the reviews for this CD player, I'd like to kick myself in the pants. I wish there was a ""no stars"" button. I bought it because it's cute, sleek and easy to carry around the house with me. When I finally received it, I was thrilled with the appearance, but when I went to try it out the CDs wouldn't play. I tried several different Cds and it whirrs them around for about a minute and then gives an error message. Now I get to go through the hassle of returning it and claiming a refund. DO NOT buy this product, spend a little more cash and get something that will actually work!"
4,GIFT FOR MY MOM,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM B/C SHE HAD ONE KINDA LIKE IT AND WORE IT OUT. IT IS A PERFECT REPLACEMENT. SHE DIDN'T NEED ANYTHING FANCY JUST SOMETHING TO PLAY HER CDS.
2,What's the buzz?,"Actually, it's more of a hum. Volume is OK and radio reception is fair but just turning it on your stuck with this annoying hum so you really can't enjoy music if you play with the volume low."
1,Waste of Money,"Before beginning my search for a third radio in less than a year I want to warn consumers about this radio. When I received it the tuner indicator did not work. Rather than go through the hassle of returning it, I decided to live with it. Unfortunately it wasn't long after that that the radio just quit. After purchasing two multi-function Radio/CD/MP3 players under $50 on Amazon, I'm disappointed. When purchased these items had mostly good reviews. The experience has led me away from Emerson and Colby products and to buy single function products, e.g., a radio, a cd player when shopping for a device under $50."
1,Very disappointing!,We bought this unit for my daughter's room (she's a year old). This unit has a loud hum ALL THE TIME even when it's off. As long as it's plugged in it's humming! We've been using it for about a year and it's already broken! Very disappointed in it.
1,SHORT LIFE CD PLAYER,I purchase this radio in June and the CD player was DOA in July. Save your money and buy another product.
4,nice cd player,"My mother bought this cd player for my room. It works fine, and is easy to move around and use. The sound is great for such a small player!"
1,DO NOT BUY - Broke in 1 Week...,Just bought this a little over a week ago to play nursery rymes in my babies room. It has already stopped working.
5,CD Player/Radio,Nice little CD player. Purchased for my son's nursery to play lullaby's at bedtime. Works very well for being used every night for 6-8 hours nonstop using the repeat feature.
1,CD did NOT work,"Bought this for my mom to take to another country, and CD did not work. We forgot to try it here in US before she left. Now she is using just for the Radio part. Too much hustle to bring back to US to send it for a return. BUYERS be aware about the CD problem."
2,Not user friendly,"All of the major adjustment controls (volume & radio station) are placed so far back that it's very hard to use. I hate the placement of the controls and the fact that it has no bass. Good for books on tape, but not music. I hate having to reach around it to find the volume and station dials. I always have to pull the whole thing toward me. Weak speakers. See how the speaker goes all the way 'round to the back? Well, the volume and the radio station controls are at the back of those speakers. Too far back!!"
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT! COSTUMER SERVICE EVEN WORSE!!!,"I have used this cd player for about 3 weeks for 20 minutes a day (played a cd before my baby went to sleep). It broke, so I tried contacting the customer service. It took 6 times (about 20 minutes each time!)before anyone even answered!! Man that I spoke with was probably the most rude customer service person that I have even meet in my entire life! Told me to send the product back to them AT MY COST and they will review and replace it. Didn't give me a reference number! I was so annoyed that I only asked if I mail it to the address on the COBY website. He said yes! I waited about a month, was on hold again for 20 minutes. When I finally got him on the phone again, he said they never received it, that I sent it to the wrong address. I am so frustrated with the whole situation. It's not about the $30, but about a company that doesn't stand behind their product! I have lost money that I paid for it, plus shipping! very dissapointed!"
1,Junk.,"Don't waste the money. My cd player quit after 6 mos and customer service refused to replace it. When 1/2 of a product's reviews are 1-2 star then buyer beware. Coby makes junk electronics. Spend your money on Sony, Toshiba or something reputable."
5,Good pre-teen choice,Granddaughter loves this Coby CD player. Can be taken ouside with batteries or can plug in inside - very versatile.
1,CD player only worked for 2 months,I have used the boom box for about a month and it works fine. I use it for approximately 3-12 hours per day. So far I have only used store-bought cds. The black and silver machine matches my kitchen and looks attractive.EDIT: The CD player stopped working after two months so I changed the review to 1 star. The radio still works but the only reason I bought it was for the CD player. I used the repeat function a lot and I normally played the boombox over 10 hours a day. Maybe these machines don't usually withstand that type of use.
1,Not good,Worked for a week and broke. Not reliable at all. Decided to go with a different brand. There is a lack of a smple and reliable boombox in market after all small digital media players have invaded the market.
2,Didn't last!,"Had this for less than a year, and it received VERY minimal use in the first couple of months. I recently started to use it nightly to play lullabies at bedtime for my infant, and after about 2 weeks, the CD player just stopped working- in the middle of a song. (and no, it was not the CD- tried various ways to see if it would work) It was a cheap purchase, so I guess I got what I paid for. However I really would have thought it would have lasted a little longer. Now I will be getting another cd player but will spend more for a product that will hopefully be better quality. Should have done that in the first place. Buyer beware of this cheap, poor quality product."
1,CD Player function doesn't work,This portable CD player was purchased for a teacher to play standardized audio tests to K-12 students. The CD function stopped working approximately 6 weeks following Christmas. This was one week longer than the Amazon return so I am left with a portable radio I don't need and a non-working CD player. Of course the CD player was tested when it was first opened and packaging materials discarded when everything tested as working. This unit is made in China where quality control is a known issue for some items.I called Coby and was told the unit has a 90 day warranty but they want $10 for return shipping. Who would trust them with more money when the unit failed?!
3,what you pay for is what you get,"I wanted to have some music without spending too much- Well, some music sounds sort of handicapped in this device. If I want to enjoy my music like before, I should get something of better quality. Otherwise, for listening to something while cleaning, or for language CDs, it's all right. And it takes up very little space."
2,Easily broken,"My husband bought this for our 6 year old daughter. She was thrilled, but within weeks the CD player stopped working. She is very gentle and never had a problem with her previous CD player, so I think this unit was faulty."
2,CD player doesn't always work,"This CD player is nice when it works, but sometimes the CD just spins and I get an error message on the screen."
3,"not bad, but could be better","With the price that I paid, this was suitable for the 8 year old who received it as a Christmas gift. Not too long after a year, it had trouble reading some of the initial tracks of a cd, but with patience, it pulls through. It never leaves the house, and never gets dirty, so I couldn't blame it on misuse. It's a decent little radio for someone who is not an audiophile, and doesn't have complicated parts that can go bad, like an automated cd drawer. Really, it is a large awkward walkman cd player, with two speakers. I can't be too hard on it. Its price was fair, and it has totally served its purpose of providing our daughter with the ability of listening to her own cds in her room."
3,Relys ONLY on batteries,I guess I assumed the product would be able to be plugged it. Pretty decent as a boom box. Gets a little costly to keep replacing batteries though.
2,Not Quite As Nice As The First Guide,"Though this Guide has a new author than the Guide for the first game, it still does not offer any further insight to Crusader than did the original to Stronghold. If anything, this manual is even more lacking as it doesn't even include the 50 scenarios comprising the Crusader Trail, and offers no information on the new AI opponents you'll be going up against in the scenarios. Like the first guide, this is really nothing more than an expanded instruction booklet and not really necessary to getting the most out of Stronghold Crusader. Much of the introductory material is just a rehash of what was contained in the original, and coverage of the new features and campaigns introduced in Crusader is far less than what I would have hoped for when buying this guide. While Crusader as a game is a worthwhile sequel (and the Warchest version even more so), this accompanying Strategy Guide falls even farther short than the original guide."
5,Very Happy,"Recieved guide as promised in coundition as promised, I have been a long time Amazon.com , I have always been happywith thier service, I trust merchants who deal with Amazon."
5,Billy the Kid;His life and legend.,I found the book very informative and added a bit more knowledge about him to what I have read over the years.I would reccommend to anyone interested in William Bonney.
4,This is a lovely collection of songs,"Having just read the previous review I have to disagree. This is a really mellow collection of songs. Of all of JJ's more recent albums this is certainly one of my favourites. There are some really lovely, relaxing songs on this album along with some excellent guitar work. Just listen to Traces, Artificial Paradise, Low Rides or Jailes. Spend a few dollars, put it on and mellow out!"
2,Red sashbuckler,"CAPTAIN SCARLETT is a real turkey that was surely kiddie matinee material six decades ago.Here you have a princess"" disguised"" as a man in clingy shape-enhancing trousers that reveal what's missing up front, and a satin blouse that doesn't hide her naders too well.

4,it is ok,"it is ok, it looks just with a little more muscles when you compare with the other troopers, the hands fall down when you are changin positions, it is very detailed,I hope only that the details with the hands dont make I loose one of them"
1,"Good idea but full of problems, do yourself a favor and buy the Archos 705","Got the Archos 504 for my granddaughter wasted hours and days trying to make it work properly, mind you I own an Archos 705 and the new Archos 7, they both work great, the 504 though is another story it freezes most of the time and the internal speaker is raspy, this unit is not worth your time you will hate it, do yourself a favor and buy the 705 or the new Archos 7 you will love them and thank me. I wish Archos would recall the 504 it's a stone age annoying clunker."
3,Oops...,"I received my order and it was a tape. I was like wth! Went and checked my order and it turns out I ordered the wrong thing(I wanted a cd). Oh well, I am just going to keep it. Not worth trying to send it back. Seller was good. Fyi...pay attention to what you order!"
1,Disappointing & Leaves you Hanging,"I have just started watching the AfterDark movies, and except for ""Tooth and Nail"", I have been far from disappointed. Until now. Like most of the reviews said, it just left me hanging. Not very well developed. It has GREAT potential to be a thriller if only the plot would have gone somewhere. I was left wondering why the girl wanted to kill them -- if it really was them; or was everything in their head? Was it all just part of the experiments? I like movies that make me think, but I like a little something to back up my thoughts. I feel like these ideas I'm just pulling out of thin air because the movie doesn't give much for you to think on....WAY too open-ended"
1,I want my time back....,"Luckily I didn't have to pay to see this movie, it was on my Comcast on Demand free movie list, which I actually had this movie on my queue for Netflix, so thought I'd check it out. I couldn't even get all the way through the movie it just would not hold my attention. I want my hour back from watching what I did watch."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Bad acting, no story, confusing, muddled, and boring. This is one of those supremely lame horror movies where one-dimensional characters wander aimlessly to creepy music, and nothing ever happens. But it is worse than that, because it is so obviously cheap and amateur. I can never get back the time I wasted watching this piece of dreck."
2,unimpressed,Interesting that the title with the biggest name actors and actresses is the least impressive. I was pretty bored by this movie. I bought all the After Dark movies and found this to be the weak point. I like all the actors and actresses here especially dina meyers but this movie went nowhere and the spooky factor was about a 3 out of 10. I'd rent or pass on this one.
2,traci,"i'm a big traci lords-fan (not of her porns) and so i bought this dvd, because i was lucky that there was a new movie starring her. the idea of the movie was not so bad, but the movie for itself was a little bit boring. also i think that some brutal scenes were cut. on this dvd were trailers from the other 7 films from the after dark horrorfest, and i think, those films are better. especially borderland, where i also bought the dvd.the first star from my rating is for a new traci-film, and the second star is therefore, that she plays almost a leading role!"
2,Almost worth the price.,"This movie carried some decent B-movie actors (and even a porn star) through a fairly solid story, but most of the people that watched this with me agreed that the ending was extremely weak. It had a great build-up, quality kills, but fizzled into either a rush job, an undecided director's bad choice, or both.Slightly scary with elements that have been run into the ground repeatedly.If you can rent it cheap, you'll like it more."
3,Not made in the USA...,"was disappointed when I received the 3 mugs I purchased. Not in the mugs themselves which met my expectations.The boxes each one came the story of tumbleweed pottery and how it had grown as a family business across generations. It painted a picture as the ""producer"" but in context gave the impression of a local manufacturer of product. There were no labels indicating the country of origin on the box which normally means one can expect the product to be made in the USA.When I opened the boxes and removed the mugs I was surprised to see a little ""made in China"" sticker. I got a buy-2-get-1-free deal, which was nice, but I thought I was supporting American manufacturing.I'm not planning on returning these. The mugs are what I wanted and they are very nice.I hope that tumbleweed will consider bringing manufacture of these good mugs back to the USA or at least make it clear where products are manufactured."
3,Rose Scented Tea,"""The Passion of this blend will enhance any encounter. Roses have long held the romance of lovers within their silky petals. Sip and linger, love is yours."" ~ZhenaAs you pour the Gypsy Love tea into your teacup on a summer morning, the delicate fragrance of fresh picked roses makes your day seem a little more romantic.Ingredients: Finest Organic Chinese Black Tea, Red & Pink Rose Petals and All Natural Flavor.The main appeal in this blend is the rose petals and the tea is very mild. This allows for the addition of other ingredients or you can make it twice as strong as recommended.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Love the tea..but this is a 3 pack..NOT a 6 pack as advertised,"I love this tea, but I only received 3 tins, not a pack 6 as advertised. I am not sure who is at fault- Amazon or Zhena's.... Will continue to get this product becuase I love it.. but someone needs to verify how many tins are in the order!"
2,"Nice idea, but...","I think this is a great premise for a kitchen that is low on counterspace. But, it does not have a very powerful microwave (650 watts). My biggest problem is with the heating element for toasting/broiling. It is a wire ""spring"" encased in a glass tube. The tube on mine broke after barely being tapped. Not a good design. It was therefore rendered unusable and had to be returned. I suggest the Sanyo EM-Z2100GS instead. It has the same features, but higher wattage and a more protected toasting element."
2,Good for only 2 years...,"We received this microwave as a wedding present, and it really was a good microwave. The toasting function is handy and seemed to work well. It is a bit small inside, but that was OK since it's just my husband and now. Now that we've had it for 2 years, it's starting to spark while it's running and I am scared it's going to start a fire in my kitchen! I know others have had this problem, and I'm actually shocked that Sharp has not recalled this item because it really poses a fire hazard. So here's what I think: great, but doesn't work long term. And for the price, you would expect to keep it longer than 2 years. Oh, and if you decide to cook popcorn, be sure and take out the turntable and try to cook it on a bowl or in a plate. As long as the bag does not touch the top or sides, it shouldn't burn. I have had much more success with it since I started doing that."
1,"Sharp Warm & Toasty, etc.","The Warm & Toasy is a very attractive unit. But, I found it not to my liking. The convection fan stays on long after you're finished using it. My apartment heated up very quickly. The toaster only toasted on one side of the bread and the convection fan is on for toast. I don't recommend this unit at all. I returned it.But, I will give Amazon high marks for customer follow service. They arranged for the unit to be picked up at my apartment and let me know when the unit would be picked up. Amazon is an excellent ""department store"" and I will continue to do business with them."
1,DEFECTIVE,Many communications of request pick up. No response from Amazon or Ritz. Please follow through.
1,sharp microwave,"My Sharp Microwave arrived on the date stated and was in excellent condition. I am very happy with the Microwave because it does so much more than microwave, it toasts, it bakes, and grills. I have only used my large oven one time since I received the Sharp Microwave. I am very happy with the price, the way I received my Microwave,and most of all is how much I enjoy using the Sharp Microwave.thanks, Martha"
5,Great multifunction oven,"This thing toasts and microwaves...and is really small (not significantly larger than the toaster / oven it replaced). I've toasted and microwaved with it and it works. Toast came out perfect and the microwaved food was cooked / hot / etc... It is a bit underpowered as both a toaster and a microwave, but that just means cooking for slightly longer than in a standalone toaster / microwave. The trade off in space savings is worth it to me (by far). The design and colors are nicer than I thought they would be. While not quite a full on stainless steal aesthetic...it pretty much looks as such.* after using this for several months we purchased a small stand alone double slice toaster. this will toast - but not nearly as good or as fast as a dedicated toaster. we still use it for a microwave and toaster oven (for larger items)."
3,Warm & Toasty Toaster/Microwave,"Still getting used to the complicated functions. Doesn't seem to really heat on the microwave side: only pops half a bag of popcorn, beverage function warms coffee only slightly. This could be part of the ""learning curve"" of using this, as it is not only a microwave, but a toaster, broiler, and toaster oven. The settings seem pretty complicated. It looks great, though, and doesn't take up much room."
1,Just doesn't work well.,This is a lemon. It takes forever to do anything and what it does heat is uneven. My easy bake oven did better job at getting things hot.
2,Good idea but a poor product,"When my wall-mount microwave broke I neede something that wound fit in a small space and since I would end up giving up my toaster oven space, I thought this would be perfect..wrong. First off, it's so tiny inside, I can't use 3/4 of my microwave cookware. I haven't used the toaster part, but the oven part is ok if you can find cookware small enough to fit on the little round turntable. The microwave part is very disappointing. If you want to make popcorn, forget it, I've tried 5 times with 3 different brands. I don't know why they even made a setting for popcorn. And it does a lousy job cooking frozen dinners. Plan on adding an extra 2-4 minutes just to get the inside cooked. This oven isn't horrible but it certainly doesn't deliver as expected."
3,"Bad toaster, weak microwave, and nothing like a convection microwave","Basically, this is a microwave oven with a infrared heating element on the top and bottom. It has a raised ceramic turntable in the center and you can use metal in there. It's intended to either grill like a toaster oven OR you can use the microwave mode, NOT BOTH. In my opinion, it is too hard to use, takes too long to cook and does not do as good of a job as a normal toaster oven. It's also inconvenient because you can't use paper towels, paper plates, plastic, etc. unless it is in pure microwave mode. I would have thought that this was going to be like a convection microwave, but I was quite wrong. I am going to return mine."
1,This thing sucks!,"Don't buy it unless you:1) Enjoy spending 10 minutes to make toast, and have to stop midway through to flip it (if you want it toasted on both sides)2) Want to watch bag after bag of Microwave popcorn get ruined and unpopped while this thing destroys it3) Hate getting your food in a timely mannerBasically, this is the multifunction printer/scanner/copier of kitchen appliances. It does everything, but doesnt do any of it well. Stay away."
1,neither a good toaster or a good microwave,"The concept is brilliant and I really wish I could say that this unit is a good combination toaster/microwave because I have limited kitchen space. Unfortunately, it only has 600 watts of microwave which means it is very slow at defrosting or microwaving a potato. As for a toaster, it is a failure. If you repeat the process two times, you will get bread with a very slight brown to it but it is not toast. I returned the unit and do not think this should be sold as it does not perform as stated."
4,Very Pleased with This Product,"This toaster oven/microwave combo works well on all features. I especially like the convenience of having atoaster oven again, and was pleasantly surprised at the excellent results of the top and bottom grilling function.There are two drawbacks: The extended noise of a cooling fan, but it only lasts a minute or two and onlyoperates after lengthy cooking times. And the time and function window is rather poorly lit. However, I lovethe ability to turn off the audible signal.Though not as powerful as our old one, it's perfect for our needs, and we love the look."
1,LONDON ROCK AND ROLL SHOW,I had been sent two discs that would not play and they were returned.The vendor has a defective product and it is a waste of your time to purchase it.
3,love of nature,"this is a story about a man with a special form of contact with the woods. that's it, actually. supernatural, not horror. good descriptions. B. is always great at decribing nature and it's lure, and how man is drawn to it. but nothing much happens, and some of the dialogue is unnecessary. (the story is actually a short story)"
1,"Great book, but terrible production","Lippmann is great, but the BN Publishing edition of this book is beyond terrible. Misplaced (or simply missing) punctuation, misspelled words, no italics or boldface where they are needed, random line breaks in the middle of sentences, no indented paragraphs, no margins on the pages, haphazard footnotes ... you get the idea.The content is worth four or five stars for all the reasons that other reviewers have mentioned, but this printing is simply unreadable."
4,Hilariously funny spoof!,"This book is an extremely funny satire. It also gives a very close up and personal look at University life ""down under"". And the fun doesn't stop right up until the very last words. Barnard pokes fun at all kinds of golden age mystery writers, and his Royle creation is absolutely wonderful. I wonder were the cops in the Australia outback as bad as this in 1974? Read this book for a good laugh, and the mystery isn't bad either."
3,Funny but not very suspenseful,"The murder-mystery plot seems to be secondary to the emerging details about the various characters. In fact, the primary character is probably the rural Australian psyche itself, and the individuals are all variations on that theme. To what extent is the book a satire of Australian life? I don't know; I've never been there. Is the book funny? Yes, wickedly so!"
5,The perfect gift for those who have everything!,"Having worked with and attended parties produced and given by David, I'm happy for all who read this book to have the opportunity to be ""in the know"" about his many secrets for successful -- mind-blowing -- celebrations. Now, everyone has access to the little and big ""things"" that makes David's parties so special. He's got to be the most creative and gracious entertainer I've seen ... and now, his readers will be too.With the holidays coming up, America Entertains is on my gift list, especially for those individuals who have everything. This book arms all of us with those special secrets to keep our guests enchanted, not just during our parties ... but for days (and hopefully longer) as the experiences are stored in their memory banks."
5,That's Entertainment!,"By presenting a variety of actual parties, David Tutera demonstrates that a little imagination can elevate a simple dinner to a stunning event. The ""Tutera tips"" are extremetly useful as are small tidbits of information scattered throughout the text from caring for orchids to choosing the right ingredients for a martini. Tutera's clever use of readily available elements inspires the at home host to try something a little different. Visually exciting tables and rooms set the tone for any entertainment you plan and this book is full of creative ways to find your inner decorator. A friend who bought the book hosted an Asian food dinner party and was inspired to decorate her table in red, black, gold and bamboo to visually carry the theme to her table. Her guests raved about the total effect proving that it really was worth the effort. Kudos to Tutera and to anyone inspired to artfully enhance their entertaining after reading this delightful, accessible book."
1,I didn't like it,The plastic cracked on me .. not while I am installing it but it got cracked over time .. didn't even run that long .. I am glade I opened my case to do regular check up and I found a lake under my VGA card .. I am glade my computer survived ! Guys get a better brand .. the installation wasn't smart and it wasn't effective .. not hard to install but it could been better.
2,Fine operation. Failed after 3 years occasional use.,Title says it all. DVD drive worked fine from when I bought it AUG 06 until it stopped spinning discs SEPT 09.This is the industrial world we live in and cannot expect anything to last very long.
5,Very informative.,"It is a very informative book. I like the way it is laid out. It gave me a better understanding of the Old Testament. Also, Geisler clearly reveals how Christ is presented in the Old Testament."
4,good!,"The book was a little more written in then I expected and it is an older version than the picture, but other than that it is in good condition!"
4,Cool remote for Ipod Nano,I got it from 1 sale a day. The unit has a pretty neat design. After I started using it for a while I found that it consumes a lot of power since the remote unit uses the power from Ipod. The remote comes with limitation controls. It works like ipod shuffle. It can play and shuffle and control the songs within the selected collection. I tried using it in my car. The sound was okay but it was lower than normal radio stations. I didn't hear any statics or noisy sound in the background and no skippings while hearing the songs. I got it for 4.99 a piece ( only shipping cost). I think it's worth the money.
3,Creative and unique,Biz Markie is without a doubt one of old schools greatest pioneers. I had the oppotunity to see him perform at the Tampa Sun Dome in 1986 and he delivered his Biz Mark antics in hillarious way. I must truly say that he kept his fans in expectation of a diabolical jam of the 80's.
4,Buy this book as a supplement to your textbook,"Other than a few typos, this book is awesome. I learn the basic concepts from this book, and then do the problems in my textbook. This book has helped me when my professor couldn't/wouldn't. You cannot learn physics from this book only, but it is an excellent addition to any textbook."
4,typographical errors,"it's a good book, it helped a great deal. I wish time was taken to correct typographical errors. I lost valuable time that could have been used to study."
2,"Many errors, weak explanations","The tittle claims to be different from other books in its method of explanation, it is not. Is filled to the brim with typos, wrong numbers, and wrong equations. Literally cannot follow the explanation to a few of the problems due to typos. Very disappointing.What is without typos, is fine, but overall there are too many errors in this book to make it useful."
4,How To Solve Physics Problems Review,The book is helpful even though the equations are set a little more complex than they have to be. And I deffinately wish there was a little bit more examples.
3,Not that intimidating,"The book starts off with the graduation of Rudy Baylor, the main character, from a Memphis college. Rudy gets a case of an insurance agent Great Benefits cheating a family whose son is about to die as the insurance company failed to pay up the cover for his bone-marrow transplant. The case goes to Rudy just before he takes up his bar exam to become a licensed lawyer. Once he passes the bar, he and a friend named Deck, the so-called paralawyer, decide to challange the insurance company being represented by one of the most expensive and well known firms in Memphis. Rudy's graduation, the pre-trial events were kinda droning along. The only likeable part of this novel by Grisham was the trial itself. Even the trial was practically far-fetched because judge Kipler is fully biased towards the plaintiff. This is normally not what happens in court. Grisham kinds makes a mockery of the legal system. But it is a little fun to read. Recommended if you have nothing else to read."
2,500+ pages of . . . huh?,"It is a testament to the great, all powerful Grisham that I actually sat and read this entire boring hunk of poopy ca-ca. I'm even getting bored now, trying to think of something to say about this. Did anyone think for a second that Rudy wouldn't beat the evil insurance co. AND get the poor little abused wifey in the end? Maybe the Jon Voight character could've sprouted vampire fangs or something. this book literally hypnotized me into thinking about leprechauns. Come on people, think! The only reason to destroy Oswald's note was because it probably warned of the attack on JFK! Now we're through the looking glass here people . . ."
4,"Enjoyed it, but...","I really can't agree with ratings of 9 to 10 in the previous reviews. Surely, Grishma is excellent but this is not utmost quality. I consider his former publications like ""the firm"" or ""pelican brief"" more exciting. Anyway, I'm waiting for ""the partner"" in paperback."
3,"Moviemaker it is, but no rain at all!","A totally going nowhere story, but highly readable, that's all. Don't get so excited to give J.G. lot of !!!!! or 10s. His books were all readable but always short of some depth, just readable and may be good for moviemakings(except The Chamber?), folks. J.G. now is also a full time movie producer, he is writing his books for screenplays only. Read them just as some better screenplays but not that great or crazy about as you guys typed. This movie is coming out soon. His only some kind great book was the ""A Time to Kill"", but it turned into a lukewarm movie"
3,"Good, but not Grisham's stunning usual...","The book was good. There were a few things unnecessary, that just side-tracked the plot. However I did get a few laughs. I personally thinkb in reality Rudy wouldn't have been quite as lucky as to get such a judge on his side.Well, just my opinion, don't mean it's right...<=o)"
2,One of Grisham's worst..,"This book was one of Grisham's worst in my humble opinion. The book goes very slow and has MANY side plots which prove to be useless in the novel. The book is a SLOW read, and the book could have EASILY been under 100 pages for the main plot. My favorite is still The Runaway Jury. The Rainmaker just lacks the big scandal we all love in Grisham's work. Those of you writing summaries for the book---don't give away what happens in the book!!!!!!!!!!!!! People read this review to see if it's a worthwhile read, not to find out what happens in the end"
4,"GOOD BOOK, BUT THERE ARE EVEN BETTER!","The Rainmaker was a very good book, I was captivated throughout the whole book. But then I read The Runaway Jury, and that I believe was just a wonderful book. I didn't know the ending until the last fifty pages, and just smiled the rest of the book, because it was so good. READ IT! Read all Grisham books"
4,"A typical, but surprising book by John Grisham.","This book is good, but not great. The main plot is how these lawyers go to a retirement home to do peoples wills and legal matters. This one lawyer gets these two clients, one whose son is dying of leukemia and her health insurance won't cover him, and she trys to sue. His other client is an old moman who's in charge of the retirement home. She rich, and she's trying to divide all her money in her will. This book is not a page turner, but I couldn't put it down. You should read this book."
2,The American dream?,The book's plot is utterly predictable. Rudy'll win his case. This you'll know since the first chapter so I ain't telling anything important because the good guys'll win and the bad guys'll loose. Rudy's biography is long and boring. I'm sure that JG can write overly better than this.
3,Not up to usual Grisham standard,"Good character development. But not up to Grisham's high standards, as in The Firm. I've read lots of Grisham; this is the weakest one I've read. He is very good, so my expectations are high."
3,Memories of a lawyer,"This novel shows the life of a lawyer through some civil cases, mainly about the insurance business. Interesting but too focused over the lights and shades of this profession."
3,An amazing story,"John Gresham has a marvellous way with stories, but this one really made me sit up and think. So many sub plots and turn arounds that keep you guessing until the end. I highly recommend it dear reader!"
4,An enjoyable adventure anyone can relate to,"A young man, struggling through college with a job and classes and the upcoming bar, finds out his future job is gone. He's in debt because his girlfriend dumped him right after buying her expensive jewelry, while facing the one of the worst Lawyer job markets around, and he just got evicted. This no luck kid finds the case of a lifetime.Grisham expertly weaves a story about this young lawyer during a crucial time of his life. Through chance, he joins up with a sleazy law firm, finds and rescues a helpless girl, and takes on a large corporation. It's a touching story that really makes you root for the main character. The book is easy and fun read, and like any Grisham novel, the pages fly by.The book is not perfect however. The ending is predictable and corny, and the hard luck story gets old after a while.I suggest this book to anyone that wants a good read. I would not recommend the movie though, as it doesn't capture any of the essence."
5,Grisham's best book.,"This book is about Rudy Baylor, fresh out of law school, who has been assigned to an incredible case that just might be the greatest insurance scam ever.Grisham tells a great story, somehow making a boring trial so interesting, you can't stop turning pages. From page 1, you find yourself cheering for the good guy, booing for the bad guy. You become sad or mad when Drummond (the bad guy) does something, and then can't stop yourself from smiling and letting out a little giggle when Rudy (the good guy) does something totally unexpected and stops Drummond's plan in its tracks. And in some places you stop breathing when Rudy or Drummond presents an unexpected clue to the jury.There is an upleasant anti-climax at the end, but Grisham rarely has good endings. Believe me, the ending's not that important if the book is so interesting, you can read 200 pages in one sitting.The Rainmaker is definitely Grisham's best book and there will always be a place for it on my bookshelf."
3,Worth Your Time,"You will be entertained by this book, and even educated about the unglamorous aspects of becoming a lawyer. I have an undergraduate and graduate in Criminology, and I have real problems about how Mr. Grisham portrays the workings of the criminal justice system...it seems slightly unrealistic, especially how openly biased judges can be for one side or another in this tale. I know just enough about the law to know that Mr. Grisham accurately breaks down the legalise into understandable language so that anyone can understand the way the law was meant to be and how the law has evolved into what it is today. And here is a refreshing twist - No sex before marriage in the romantic side of this story (Thank You, Mr. Grisham). And as always, Mr. Grisham neatly ties up all loose ends so there are no questions or misunderstandings at the end. Just remember that this is entertaining FICTION, not a college textbook."
4,FuN BoOk To ReAd,"I hate reading books, but I must admit ""The Raimnaker"" is one of those of books I actually enjoyed reading. The positive side was it keeps you in suspense, but the negative part was that everything went to easy and smoothly for the main character, at some parts you can predict easily whats going to happen next. And another thing I didn't like was how Tyrone Kipler ganged up on Drummond and supported Rudy a little too much and was being very unfair to him, I felt sorry for the guy. But in conclusion its entertaining its worth the time and effort."
4,Excellent book and very unpredictable!!!!!!,This book was well worth reading. It had a great ending as well as a great beginning. The outcome of the book will surprise you. I would read this book over again and again. As usual Mr. Grisham another great book!!!!!
5,John Grisham Writes Another Hit,"When I looked at this book, I thought to myself, ""there is no way I will read such a long book,"" but as I began to leaf through the pages, I sat down and read it. Three hours later I was still engulfed in it. The description is so vivid I feel as if I'm in the story line myself. I can relate to the situations the characters deal with. There are many conflicts that all intertwine with one another. A love story evolves, but doesn't disrupt the main plot. I had already watched the movie, so I always pictured the main character, Rudy, as Matt Damon. When I finished the book, I was upset; I wish it were a never-ending novel."
3,Standard Fair,"Well its another McBook from the burn and turn factory know as Grisham Inc. I am convinced he has a group of Santa's elf's slaving away in some South Carolina sweat shop turning these screen plays - sorry, I mean books out. If you have read some of the authors books in the past you have a good idea of what you are going to get. An easy to read and understandable book that is as light as cotton candy. I actually think the movie was better. Why do I read his books, for the same reason I eat junk food, it is easy to get, fast and not complicated. Sometimes you just need a little light reading to take the stress from the day and his books fit that bill."
4,"rainmaker, the","Rudy bailer was fresh out of law school when he got his first big case. It was summer in Memphis, and the company he was just working laid him off due to a merger. To make matters worse, he just got evicted from his apartment and had no place to go. Finding the next available job, he started working for a new law firm. Eventually, the FBI closed in and shut down his new office and he was yet again out of a job. So Rudy and another employee of the firm started an all new practice together. Although some of the first months are trying times, they stumble upon a very interesting bad faith insurance claim. A boy was dying of leukemia and the insurance carrier would not pay for kemo-therapy. So Rudy takes them to court."
1,Not his best work,"This is my least favorite Grisham book. Aside from the underdeveloped plot, the characters are very flat. And, the story, especially the ending, is so completely far-fetched, it makes the endings of The Firm and The Pelican Brief seem plausible.I don't understand the hype this book receives, it certainly doesn't deserve it. Grisham knows how to keep the reader captivated, so it's disappointing to read something like this and know that he could have done a lot better."
3,Typical Poor ending Grisham book.,This was an exciting and funn book to read. I stayed up all night to finish it only to be increadibly dissapointed by the ending. I went away wishing I had never strted it in the first place. Grisham has a way of ruining so many books in the last few chapters.
5,ABSOLUTELY PAGE-TURNING!,"I have read the Pelican Breif from Grisham, and this one tops it! I couldn't keep the book away from me for more than 2 minutes! The 598 page book kept me flipping and flipping as Rudy life goes on! He goes through some horrible times..."
3,Grisham's Rainmaker: a good first draft,"This novel has a number of fairly serious structural problems.While Grisham can plot interestingly, and I admit his protagonistis basically appealing, he wastes a great deal of time onsubplots which simply go nowhere and have no significance tothe story as a whole. The courtroom scenes are the best-written in the book, but they unfortunately don't provide muchin the way of conflict -- the protagonist simply storms throughthe trial without a single hitch, and with quite a few thingsgoing his way purely through random luck. There is a romance --but it's badly developed, and the female half of it is a purestereotype, without a single distinguishing characteristic. Igive this book a reluctant six because despite its many flaws,it does succeed in capturing the reader's attention fairly well."
5,Typical Grisham suspense thriller,"""The Rainmaker"" is the best book written by the master storyteller.It shows how his style has devolped since ""The Firm"". It also showshow he has sensitively dealt with death.The best book I haveread in along time."
2,Will someone please find an editor for John Grisham!,"It seems that Mr. Grisham is now being paid by the word. There are perhaps 150 good pages of writing in this 500 page opus. They involve the actual courtcase, which is fast moving with creative and surprising twists and turns. The problems develop when the author inserts multiple storylines that exist independently of the central case and, in the vast majority of them, are not resolved in the confines of the book. Case in point, Rudy's second boss is implicated in some underworld dealings. After focusing on these for several pages, they are never referred to again. In addition, his focus on a half-developed personal relationship between Rudy and a needy twenty-something is never explained and seems to exist for Hollywood's purposes only. If you want to read Grisham, read ""A Time to Kill"""
2,Memphis faire tale,"It's about a law student, graduate, then brand new lawyer, Rudy Baylor and how he scrambles to survive in the lawyersaturated town of Memphis Tenn. Some of the things he does and the endless chain of lucky coincidences were hardto swallow but it was fun anyway, almost like a fairy tale. Until the last 32 pages and the off the wall 50 million dollarverdict. That was the last straw. Rudy only sued Great Benefit for 10 million and I figured he get maybe 5. Where the50 came from I don't know. And how Great Benefit could go bankrupt when just last week in court they were worth450 million, 100 million of that in cash, I don't know nor believe? And it quickly disintegrated from there."
3,Not worth the effort,"I personally was not impressed with this latest attempt of J.G.'s. The plot was extremely predictable, and too good to be true. While his writing techniques and diction remain impressive, the story itself lacked the suspense of a true Grisham. Too many meaningless side stories and lucky coincidences make this story unbelievable, and only mildly entertaining. It is a decent novel, but not up to par with a classic like ""A Time to Kill."""
5,G-R-E-A-T!!! One of his most intriging ever!,"The Rainmaker is an ever-turning novel which made you read the book cover to cover before placing it down. Rudy, a recent graduate of law, needs to find a job desperatly and when an insurance fraud case with significant potential was brought before him, that's when the real story begins!"
5,Again a greaaaaattt Grisham,"The Rainmaker is again a great book by John Grisham. In this Book you have an Hero likes McDeere in ""The Firm"". I have only three Words: Buy and read!!!!!"
2,Light and fluffy,"I love books that attack the insurance industry, corrupt lawyers and judges but the ending was entirely too similar to some of his other books. An easy read if you have be confined in a plane or car."
2,You'll be disappointed.,"I loved every minute of this book except the ending. The main body is filled with wit and excitement as we follow Rudy in his attempts to find a job and try his first case. At this point Grisham presents the reader with a half baked , totally unbelievable mini drama, the outcome of which made me dislike a previously likeable character. Rudy, who detests the unethical practices of those around him, lets the reader down. The final chapters give the impression that the author wants to finish up quickly, but instead of saying ""and they all lived happily ever after"", he writes "" and they all commited some serious crimes, flew to the moon and lived there happily ever after"". You'll be disappointed."
5,Definitely His Best Work,"I've read almost all of Grisham's books and through the years I've always considered The Rainmaker his best work. I chuckled numerous times, which, to me, is a demonstration of good writing if it can get me to laugh. The protagonist was likeable and all the backstories did not detract from the main theme of David vs. Goliath in Lawyerdom. Overall a very satisfying book, more than I can say for some of his novels. Kudos to The Rainmaker!"
5,Excellent mass market fiction,"This novel, like The Firm, is perfect vacation reading. Grisham is a quality writer who knows how to tell a story. The story here kept me interested to the end and was entertaining throughout. There's not much more you can ask for from mass market fiction. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"
3,"He made hay, while it rained","When you fight a legal battle, there is at least a few hurdles you have to overcome. Rudy Baylor didn't have any. A judge who would do anything to help him, a dead victim who left behind a moving video, helpful professors, and SUBSTANTIAL evidence...what else can a trial lawyer ask for? Although the plot has its share of suspense and drama, it's smeared with serendipity. Perhaps, Grisham could've done with a little more ingenuity in the plot. However, all this doesn't make the book boring. In fact, it lives upto Grisham's ""unputdownable"" standard."
5,The Rainmaker was so good I could'nt put it down,"Grisham is the best author ever born. The plots to his stories are so compelling. This book puts you in touch with ""The Real World"" and attaches you emotionally with each character."
5,"Grisham's best, hands down!","This is by far John Grisham's best work, at least of the several I've read. Great character development: Rudy Baylor and his somewhat sleazy sidekick Deck Sheffler come alive, and they're real. And this book is FUNNY! The comic relief blends effectively with the tragic core of the story, which involves the death of a young man by leukemia while his uncaring insurance company gleefully pockets the premiums. Grisham's (Rudy's) wry narrative of these events is priceless. And while the David and Goliath plot may be a bit hackneyed, it engages the reader as only Grisham can. First class!"
3,"Good storyline, but some unbelieveable characters.","I liked the concept of this book, however, do not believe in the ""real"" world that any small time rooky attorney could win against the big time insurance companies! Not really. However, I enjoyed living the fantasy. Too bad this kid decided he didn't want to be a lawyer any more!"
5,Hooray to the underdogs!Thumbs down to the insurance company,"John Grisham is awesome again!! Can't wait for his other works. Presently reading the ""Partner"" and again he does not disappoint. He definitely brings his readers on a thrill of a ride. Belive me, once you read one of his book, you can't wait for the next one."
2,Boring,"Story was boring, and everything was written in the present tense. Excitement and tension were left out, and main character seemed like a dope."
5,The Rainmaker by John Grisham,"I have a short attention span,so this book held me thru the entire book..""The Rainmaker"" by John Grisham..GREAT..I enjoy suspense"
3,My first Grisham,Good book when traveling because it doesn't require a whole of attention yet is an entertaining read. His negative opinions of lawyers (he's one himself) is a lot of fun especially if you know a few lawyers. He's not a great literary stylist but it is a good read. His newest one his only non fiction is much better written
4,Definite page turner,"I couldn't put it down, read it in two days. It is another great book by John Grisham."
3,Of very uneven quality but on the whole entertaining,"The main storyline contains courtroom drama that matches Grisham's best for attorney shenanigans and legal surprises. I couldn't stop reading the portions that described the trial.On first reading, the first 100 pages bored me. But now that I am re-reading, I see the point and they are ok.The conclusion is bizarre and anticlimactic and seems silly, as though Grisham couldn't come up with a sensible end. The love intrigue is irrelevant to the case against the insurance company and is contrived.The story is marred by Grisham's tendency to use his story for his far-left activism. Here it is a campaign against big corporations (insurance, in this case) and abusive husbands.With good editing, condensation, and self-discipline, this could have been a masterpiece."
2,My first Grisham - I was disappointed,"I am surprised by all the glowing reviews. This was my first Grisham book and I expected more. Sure, he writes well and the reading is easy, but the plot left a lot to be desired. I never saw the movie, but if you have seen any TV show or movie involving lawyers then you know this book."
2,Of very uneven quality,"The first 100 pages or so are quite boring.Then Grisham hits his stride. The main storyline contains courtroom drama that matches Grisham's best for attorney shenanigans and legal surprises. I couldn't stop reading the portions that described the trial.The conclusion is bizarre and anticlimactic and seems silly, as though Grisham couldn't come up with a sensible end. The love intrigue is irrelevant to the case against the insurance company and is contrived.The story is marred by Grisham's tendency to use his story for his far-left activism. Here it is a campaign against big corporations (insurance, in this case) and abusive husbands.With good editing, condensation, and self-discipline, this could have been a masterpiece."
2,Reading not enabled!,"Bummer, I can't stand when good books have the reading feature disabled on Kindle. Never would have bought it if I'd seen that..."
5,Difficult to put down - very well written - another classic,This book was difficult to put down but incredibly long. The subtle nuances authored by Mr. Grisham provide a compelling and thought provoking reading. The part addressing wiretapping and the hilarious results surrounding the pompous big time attorney and the jury is one of many examples of the tremendous talent that Mr. Grhisham exhibits in his authorship. Well Done..!!!
5,This Was A Good Book,"I really enjoyed this book. After being very disappointed with The Client, and somewhat bored with A Time To Kill, this was a reminder of how much I enjoy Grisham (The Firm, The Pelican Brief). Looking forward to The Partner"
4,Absorbing story but weak ending,"The story kept me reading avidly. The ending was disappointing, but don't let it put you off. Definitely worth a try."
4,"An excellent, light but interesting read.","As a first time reader of Grisham I am compelled to read more based on ""Rainmaker"". The plot was simple but the story rolled along comfortably. Writing style is a little 'gum-shoe detective' and I found Baylorisms creeping into my own language. Characters were believable enough. The ending is fine. When you've got nowhere else to go but down and you've become cynical of your profession, the distance seems a good place to be. Not an intellectual book but an enjoyable read."
3,Did the publishing deadline steal the ending?,"I am not a great reader, so getting through a book this long is a challenge for me. I loved the plot: it was well crafted with limitless potential to weave the pieces together into an intriguing conclusion. But alas! I was disappointed. Seemed like Grisham ran out of time at the end."
2,Disappointing ending!,"While I enjoyed reading most of the book the ending was a huge disappointment. It felt rushed and carelessly thrown together, like a high school student hurrying to finish an overdue book report.The characters were very superficial. Not Grisham's best, or even close."
2,Not Grisham,"Lacks the mystery and intrigue of past books. It is all about lawyers, bad ones, good ones and a recent young lawyer admitted to the bar."
5,ONe of his best,Ijust finished this one and it was one of the best of his that I have read. On to reading The associate now
2,"This one must be the script for a ""made for tv"" movie.","The weakest of Grisham's stories, this one reads as if it was written to be the Sunday night ""made for tv"" special ---doesn't even make the big screen! The character development leaves us with nothing more than caricatures. And theonly satisfying part about the ending was that the story was over."
4,"Rudy Baylor, the Rocky Balboa of all attorneys.","John Grisham has crafted an intriguing, fast-paced storywhich will keep the reader turning pages long after thethe family has gone to sleep. Grisham's main character,Rudy Baylor, quickly becomes a close acquaintance of thereader. Rudy is a young, ambitious law student who getsthoroughly ""kicked around"" by circumstances beyond hiscontrol. His inherent intelligence and amazing ability tomake the right decisions at the right time, especially whileemployed by a ""sleaze-bucket"" attorney firm in Memphis, eventuallybring him to the ultimate heights of justice andjurisprudence in the American legal system. The final pagescaused me to wonder if it is possible that Rudy Baylor might,in some way, be related to Rocky Balboa? Grisham laces hisstories with believability in his characters and just enoughlegaleze to wrap us in tight blanket of suspense. A must read."
4,Clever plot construction makes the Rainmaker a winner,"Let's hear it for the underdog!! Grisham weaves a clever tale of a law school grad going up against a huge corporation with its high-octane lawyers in a wrongful death suit. You can't help but root for Rudy Baylor, the rookie lawyer. There is, of course, the obligatory romance to spice things up, as well. My only problem with the story was how Grisham trivializes the death of one of the characters in the book, an abusive husband, and how Baylor rides off into the sunset at the end (with his new love). Good read!!!"
5,The Rainmaker reigns in success,This was the very first John Grishim book I ever read - I was afraid that coming from a lawyers point of view that the story would include too much legalism and too little plot - That was not true of The Rainmaker. Told in the first person I related so well to the story of a new lawyer trying to get a job that I finished the book in a matter of days (record time for me). Everyone who has been unemployed and gone thru the frustrations of getting that ONE job will also be able to relate. The movie was good the book as always was better.
2,Boring and the main character was a complete waste.,"I had no cares for any of the people in this story. This is boring and simple reading. If this was the only Grisham I ever read, it would be the last. People you are being too kind to this author. He is turning out junk by the minute."
3,The Rainmaker,"Arrived within a reasonable amount of time. Some (slight) wear on the book in the spine, but overall satisfied with the condition."
5,Book Definitely Better than the Movie,"I saw the movie before I read the book. I agree that the movie was good, but the book is by far better. I wish they wouldn't have changed things around in the movie, but due to time, they sometimes have to. I think the book was very easy reading and a great story. I highly recommend this book if your are looking to just sit back relax and get engrossed in a good book."
5,Hilarious Courtroom scenes,"Though I am not a fan of litigation, this is an awesome book. The courtroom scenes between beginner Rudy and the seasoned veteran; forget his name; were absolutely hilarious. The antics of Deck and Rudy are fun to read and make the book lots of fun.The other plotline is much more serious, but just as good. I won't say anything because it is better the first time. Buy this book!"
2,80% good then a dud,I could not put the book down but the ending sounded like Mr Grisham was past his deadline and had to get the manuscript in. The ending (which I will not disclose) is a great dissappointment. He wraps up his loose ends in a most sloppy of manners. A good book with a bad ending makes this attempt at a novel mediocre at best
1,"Quite frankly, boring.","John Grisham usually writes pretty decent books (A Time to Kill and The Firm are my favorites) but this was just BORING. It was just too easy for Rudy to win that case. It made me laugh when he tricked the defense after they bugged his phones, but his tricking the defense made it too easy. Most of the book was about his economic problems which weren't all THAT bad. Or maybe they were bad but Grisham didn't play up on them enough. This is not just my opinion. Two friends of mine have read the book and they both agree with me."
3,This shoud be the last in your list of Grisham's works,"I started reading all Grisham's work with ""Client"". This book held me spellbound and after that I became one of Grisham's numerous fans. But the ""RainMaker"" and ""Parter"" were somewhat disappointment to me. The plot is too predictable and the characters are not fascinating as in ""Client"". Maybe, as other readers suspected, Grisham is considering screenplay too much. If you think you'r passionate fan of Grisham, you'd better try other works."
3,Too Many Subplots,"This is a classic David and Goliath story which pits a little known, beginner lawyer against a gigantic, well-financed insurance company. But this book is also many other stories many of which have untied loose ends and have too little to do with the main story to help it. For example whatever happened in regards to the building that Rudy is accused of blowing up? And I think that John Grisham could have done without the character of Kelly. Rudy's relationship with her is way too predictable, making it harder to sympathize with her. In short, what should have been just a good story about a lawyer going up against a bigger enemy almost becomes lost in the jungle of subplots."
5,Love it!,"I'll admit I was drawn to this book because of the movie (which is one of my favorites). But the book is even better... a much more in depth look at ""Rudy's"" background and his challenges. Grisham has an amazing way of mixing daily activities with courtroom drama to create absolute masterpieces. I'm a huge Grisham fan and ""The Rainmaker"" is definitely one of his best."
1,Bad News,I have owned 4 of his grills a loved them all. But this one is terrible. It doesnt get hot enough and it seems like it steams the meat. I would like to know how to return it I through the box away .I only have the outer box. I personally dont think its any good. Edward from Ma. George Foreman Grill with removeable plates
4,The Comstock Lode,"In typical fashion for his work Louis L'Amour demonstrates his vast knowledge of the short but legendary era of the American cowboy. That knowledge lends a unique authenticity and tone to each of his novels and in Comstock Lode we not only have a fast paced story line with well developed characters; we have an authoritative exploration of the gold rush. L'Amour strips away the glamor usually associated with gold digging and shows us the back breaking, often disappointing labor it required. I enjoy L'Amour's vision and presentation of the old west even more than Zane Grey's."
4,"lots of fun, shifter rules",the shifter is cool and the e-brake doesn't hurt. i had a V# racing wheel and i broke i think this is a etter quality iteam
5,SO HAPPY!,"Thank you so much for the immediate shipment of this item. I had ordered it from Amazon and waited six months for availability before it was cancelled so was very, very surprised to receive the book from you so quickly. Thnak you very much! :)"
2,dont buy this,"this is a waste, the info inside is not true. illustrations are worthless. this is a waste, the info inside is not true."
3,Misleading title for a rundown of 'herbs' found in America,"First of all, if you thought this book was referring to herbs used by Native Americans, you were right only to a very minor degree. The book is actually referring to herbs found and used in America. This includes all herbs, native or introduced. It reviews each herb, it's scientific name, and common names, a description of each, and their uses. Most uses are for ""folk medicine"", although clinical uses and their effects are also given. Doses are given in most instances."
5,A Handbook of Native American Herbs,"This is a really good book with a lot of informationi would recommend this to a person who wanted to learnabout herbs, the picutres are black and white ink figuresso a book to actually see the herbs actual look would needto be purchased, unless you already know what they look likeI'd recommend the great information inside this book"
5,herbal education,this one was a replacement for one that I lost when I moved. very important part of my herbal library as there are entries from various parts of the world.
5,Amazed,"Rather than buy the more expensive Kitchen Aid, I opted to buy this mixer because of the 400 watts power, the tilt back head, and the large bowl. Had I realized what a difference a fine quality tool can make in preparation tasks, it would have been in my kitchen years ago. A large Christmas pound cake recipe with fruit that last year took all my bowls to prepare and nearly killed my hand mixer was done in a jiffy with this mixer, and the kitchen was not declared a national distaster area this time. It also kneaded fondant, making mixing in the color tint and flavoring a 30 second job compared to the evenings I had spent previously preparing it by hand.The tilt option makes changing the mixing tools much easier.I highly recommend this reasonably priced mixer."
1,RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS MIXER!!!!,"I purchased this yellow mixer at Kitchen Collection. I have a 5 qt KitchenAid but I thought this might be kinda fun because of the 400 watts. I WAS SO VERY WRONG!!! I tried to make a batch of bread...one loaf...and the mixer labored and bounced around on the counter. To top it off, it took 2 people to turn the bowl to remove it from the mixer. All I can say is RUN..RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS ONE. I love my KitchenAid...I am looking for more power...I think I may invest in a Viking. If you are going to buy anything...at least buy KitchenAid. This mixer gets the big THUMBS DOWN!! Unfortunately for me, it is past the 30 days so I cannot return it. I guess I will donate it to Goodwill!!!"
1,"Do not buy, It won't last","I bought this mixer as I really needed a stand mixer and could not afford the one I really wanted, and the 400 watt motor sounded great to me, I made 2 types of candy with it, no problem, when I went to make Peanut butter cookies with it, the motor started smoking and stinking, the Peanut butter cookies killed the motor. So being nice as I am, i just requested a replacement as I figured that It was a defective. Well, I sent that one back, and got the new one (model number and same color, red), and bingo, It died again, motor went out on peanut butter cookies, and my recipie is a soft dough, nothing tough about it at all, my small hand mixer has no problem with this dough. So I don't recommend this mixer for anyone. Stay Far Away!!"
5,A Timely Read (At Least for Me),"As a college-bound 17 year old, I'm so glad to have read Fathers and Sons. Arkady's dilemma is one to which I can strongly relate, as my own value system somewhat conflicts with those of my parents. I highly recommend this deeply moving novel to anyone, especially ideologically rebellious teenagers."
3,What happened to the part with the clown?,"What's with this translation?! It left out the part with the clown! That was the best part in the book! Without the clown, the whole thesis collapses altogether! You're better off learning Russian or waiting for a new translation to come out, because without the clown it's rubbish!"
5,The Russians know how to write,"The way this story is told and the characters drawn is like watching a movie with a camera moving in and out of focus. We are allowed inside a character's thoughts for a certain period of time, then he moves us up and out of them and onto another scene. The transitions smoothly lead the reader through the story. I didn't want it to end. The story is relevant to issues people face even today. It's a great book."
4,Great book,"Not exactly a connoisseur, I would say I am definitely a Russian literature enthusiasts, and rank the writings of the Russians up there with the greats. Doestoyevsky is tops, and Checkov for drama, though after reading Father and Sons, I am apt to squeeze Turgenev in front of Tolstoy. It's a difficult read, no doubt, one that requires determination, perhaps equal to the determination of that protagonist Bazarov and his scientific determinism. As in any good novel, the weightier aspects of the story are gradually revealed, the more potent, effectual details saved for last. I found certain sections a bit winded, particularly some of the exchanges between the protagonist and his enamored disciple, and close friend Arcady. The copy I read is the Signet Classic, translated by Reavy. Russian literature is effective because it always seems to ruffle the feathers of the litterati elite. I'm not sure if modern America can provide a similar experience (maybe South Park?)"
4,This book has present day relevance.,"This was a wonderful, albeit wordy, book. While is presents a slice of life in Russia in the 1800s, the theme of the older generation's impatience and lack of understandng of that of the younger generation is timeless. It is peculiarly Russian, with much of the heated exchanges between the main characters being about the need for social change in the Russian aristocracy of the time. And, as is typical of youthful views, (or of change and revolution perhaps), the two positions are at extreme odds with each other. If you enjoy social and political history, families, and intellectual debate, this is a fine piece of literature."
2,what's the deal Ivan?,"I can't believe this is the best Turgenev could do for a nihilist character: a grumpy geek who loves frogs. Compared to the extremism of characters in Nabokov, Mailer, Rushdie etc. this Bazorov guy couldn't possibly be more boring."
3,Fathers and Sons,"Perhaps because it was originally written in Russian & translated to English, it was a little wordy. Also, the vocabulary & sentence structure were different because it's so old, making it somewhat difficult to understand & follow. The story, itself, was good however."
4,symbolic,"Characters are carefully described to respresent different political and cultural positions in the 19th Century Russia where old and new are unclear but in vigorous transition. Unlike Dostoevski (whom I admire as well), Turgenev's approaches to the characters and stories are rather calm and controlled. They are not exaggerated or dramatic, their thoughts do not shift back and forth, and there is not alot of pondering. In the end, wherever the history takes, there is a sense of continuation of life, ""However passionate, sinning, and rebellious the heart hidden in the tomb, the flowers growing over it peep serenely at us with their innocent eyes; they tell us not of eternal peace alone, of that great peace of ""indifferent"" nature; they tell us, too, of eternal reconciliation and of life without end."
1,genealogical table in roman?,"I haven't bought the book yet but it seems from the preview, the genealogical table and TOC inside of the book are going by the Roman names as opposed to Greek names. I wish it's the later since the Greek mythology was created long time before the Roman mythology."
3,Giant fish and monkey suits,"One of Edward Packard's attempts at writing a book for younger readers (2-3 grade) this one is more about illistration than actual writing.You have an uncle who works in the space program and have been invited for a tour of the area. Your bossy (and obviously disobedient) cousin drags you onto a rocket to get a closer look. After she fiddles around with some wires you're out in space! Well, you can either try to stop the ship or let it take you to mars. Both choices give you a completely different story line so you have some interesting possibilities. While it doesn't actually SAY you die during the course of the stroy some of the endings do end up that way (logically speaking).There is but one alien race in this particular story so if you're looking for a book that talks about another planet or space exploration forget it. You can only visit Earth, and Mars ... A good book for younger readers interested in space."
5,oldie but a goodie,This is a old cd I have. I love it. They mixed r&b with west coast gangsta music which was on fire at the time. It the bay area rappers really. They have some of the best songs put out by the artis like mc eight and ant bank best work. Hi five and kenya groove is good. Master p redid that kenya groove beat. But buy this it a good all around mix.
5,The Must Have WestSideGangsta Beats to Boom Ur Trunk,I bought This CD not to long ago after already growing up to the Chronic G-Style G-Funk WestCoast LifeStyle & Sound this CD was a must have after the fact of already on This CD almost every track maybe cept three of them would make you want to have this part of your personal collection OH!! I forget to tell U I grew up on those albums during my elementry-school days So do yourself a favor if you call yourself a fan of or Hip-Hop
5,"For the buck, this is the best out there.","I have a multitude of microphones, and regularly use everything from AKG 414s to Neumann U87s in the studio. Five years ago, I got a pair of the Studio Project C1s after hearing them at the NAMM show, and for routine projects (other than my Shure KSM32s) they are my 'go to' mics. I love them.They have sonic characteristics that are remarkably similar to a U87 (the recording studio high-end workhorse for the last 30+ years), but at 1/10 of the price. You have to hear it to believe it. I know I did.For those of you who may be new to this field, like most other studio microphones, this mic is not intended for live performances and requires a preamp with phantom power."
1,Apocalyptica: The Life Burns Tour,"If you have heard Apocalyptica before, you won't be disappointed in the music. Unfortunately, the video editing is so chaotic, with constant cuts, that you rarely get to actually watch the musicians play their music, which is the reason I bought the video in the first place. It seems the company that made the video wanted to impress us with their fancy editing techniques. Well I'm impressed. But I didn't buy the video to see fancy editing. I bought it so that I could get a close-up look at terrific musicians in action, watch their fingering, see their faces, see which guy is playing which part, and watch their incredible drummer. I do give it one star though, because there is at least one song that is fairly well done that I have watched a couple of times, and that I have shown to friends who were curious about Apocalyptica."
2,Hard to watch this.....,"I really like the music, but this video is hard to watch because the camera view is moving around constantly..... Whoever edited this video sucks big time. This reivew is for the video only, not the band or the music. 2 stars for the video."
5,A triumph of life over cruel adversity,"What a wonderful gift from Katherine Hoeger Flotz! A deeply moving memoir of a child's recollections of life in one of Tito's concentration camps. A story not only of survival but of triumph over deadly adversity. This is a most valuable contribution to the too little known saga of the ethnic cleansing of the Donauschwabians after WWII. As a fellow survivor from another village I was often moved to tears as I read this memoir. Enriched by deeply evocative family photos, touching but never vengeful, A Pebble in MY Shoe deserves a wide readership. A triumph from a wise and generous survivor."
3,disappointing,"the music was tinny. i hoped to feel uplifted with the song ""on eagles wings"" and i felt like i was just being given only half ot the true beauty of the song. our son is in baghdad and my heart is always there with him. the words of this song soothe my soul but the music made me feel empty. it was a dissapointment."
1,Too Small,i bought a timex big numbers watch at Walmart and it lasted for years. I wore it at work and it got heavy duty exposure. It was super tough for a leather-band women's watch. I normally wear Baby-G's but I got tired of the weight of them. I somehow lost my Timex watch and needed a new one. I thought this watch was the same one I had but it isn't. This watch is tiny! I am not a huge girl but this feels like a child's watch....way too delicate. The Amazon photo looked like my old watch but it is definitely much smaller. This watch goes to the thrift store. It's junky.
5,Watches,The Timex Women's T2H331 Analog Silver-Tone Case Black Leather Strap Dress Watch arrived on time and in excellent condition. I have always and will always recommend a Timex watch.
1,"I've owned two, neither worked for long.","I bought my first copy of this watch a year or so ago and the date function never worked right; it moved forward every *other* day instead of every day. I returned it for a new one, which was fine for about 7 months before the date on that one broke too. I'm still using it because it keeps accurate time and I like that it lights up, but having an incorrect date displayed can be a bit confusing."
5,Good Service,"1 of: Timex Women's Leather Easy Reader Strap Watch, 2H331, Indiglo, QUICK-DATE, 30 MeterSold by: Chelsea Watch (seller profile) This was recieved fast and in perfect condition."
4,My Go To Wrist Watch,"This is the 3, 4th or maybe 6th Timex watch of this type. Works well. Love the Indiglo feature. Easy to read and comfortable. Just enough features for my needs."
3,I love it.,no frills. does what it's supposed to. the leather band can be of higher quality but it is just $30.
4,Like it but wish...,I really like this watch. The face is great...numbers and second hand is easy to read. I only wish the watch band had the buckle further over because my wrist is size 8 and buckle ended up getting in the way because it's not centered.I would recommend it very highly.
1,Not worth it,I have had to replace the band twice and the date function no longer works. I only bought this watch less than 3 months ago. Not a typical Timex product.
1,Should have listened to others reviews,"I purchased this watch as a gift for my sister-in-law. The customer reviews I read said it was junk, but I really liked the style of black letters on white face, leather strap - just right for a nurse. True to form it broke in the first month. She had to send it away for repair. Don't take the chance!"
4,Timex watch,"I love this watch as the face is so easy to read although I ignore the date as that is too small for me to see most of the time and it's a pain to set. The watch strap is very long so if you have a small wrist, the extra length is a nuisance. I'm a swimmer and I've found that it's simpler to replace the watch than to replace the battery - I've never had success as once the watch is opened up to change the battery, it doesn't seal effectively and water gets in and after a few weeks there is so much condensation under the glass that I can't tell the time. I've had about 6 of these watches - and and will probably continue to buy them."
3,Slow beginning but a powerful finish,"This latest in the Joanne Kilbourn series gets off to a very slow beginning. At about 50 pages in, I almost set the novel aside. I had seen movies based on Bowen's previous mysteries and enjoyed them very much. So I was puzzled. But then the pace picked up. The apparent suicide of a lawyer who had confided in Kilbourn the night before is a signal that not all is right in Lawyer's Bay and,in particular,with the members of Falconer Schreve who all have lavish summer homes there. Joanne discovers that a young associate has gone missing from the law firm, supposedly to better job in Vancouver but that is a ruse.As the plot advances Joanne learns that her former lover,police inspector Alex, is involved with the wife of one of the lawyers and appears to be implicated in a coverup. After a slow start the story races to a shocking finish."
2,Get the Bugaboo,"I was hesitant(b/c of cost) about getting the Bugaboo so tried the Zippy. However, the beverage holder was broken upon receipt and the wheels squeeked badly. Plus, the bottom doesn't hold much. Also, I kept kicking the stroller when I walked. I'm 5""8 and I thought it wasn't tall enough for me or my husband who is 6 feet. I was so frustrated that I sent it back and ordered a Bugaboo."
3,Pretty Good Set,"I got this Album recently because I wanted to get the tracks that R.Kelly did on this set.""Everything's so different without you"" was a decent slow-cut but the Other Kelly Produced track ""Can we go round again"" moved me a bit more.I dug the Sax on that cut.the rest of the Album has some pretty good moments but Billy truly hit His Peak in the very early 80's.still this set has moments."
2,Problematic.,"Hooked it up. No power to accessory wire.Disconnected, reconnected all wiring, verified, soldered in connections.Still no acc power.ended up wiring into the fusebox. Sad to see such an expensive product have that kind of issue.Also disables your alarm, There was no indication that this product would do that. The auto locks and delayed locks still work. But the ""security"" light on the dash never comes on now, and if you pop the door open, the alarm no longer goes off.3 months into having the product, The car no longer has a ""dinger"""
3,Does the job,"I was upgrading my stereo, and needed it to enable my On-Star, phone, and turn signals to keep working. Unfortunately, you need to buy separately a relay, an additional speaker, and a push button switch if you want to control the volume. For the money, they should all be included, as the part is just a small box with wiring and plugs.Instructions were clear and easy to follow, and everything works properly now."
5,Great product and great customer service from 3M!,"I had purchased the Post It Flag Highlighter after seeing it featured on an Oprah. Instantly, it was a favorite, not only for reading, but also for bill paying and going through my cookbooks. After a month of normal use, the highlighter portion dried out though, long before I ran out of flags. I emailed 3M on their website, not specifically asking for anything, just telling them that I was disappointed that the highlighter had expired so quickly. They immediately replied and sent me a free replacement, asking that I return the defective highlighter using their pre-paid postage so that they could look the highlighter over in their lab. I was really impressed, not only with the ingenuity of the product, but also with 3M's customer service and their desire to improve their product."
4,new item for me,"first time I ever bought this type of device. Very convenient for marking up and posting a book. I usually don't mark in books, so it was hard for me to do it, but this makes it very easy."
5,Excellent transaction and product!,"The product is compact and handy, reading and studying is easier with this tool, colors are vivid."
3,Don't Last,"I love the convenience of the flags, but the highlighters do not last long enough. I am a college student who doesn't even read anywhere near all of the homework and I have torn through all three of these in less than a semester. Now they are just cluttering my desk drawer because I don't want to throw the rest of the flags away!"
5,love this duel function highlighter,"Great novel idea, no more looking for a little sticky--its right there attached to the highlighter"
3,DISAPPOINTED,"Each product alone is wonderful, but I expected the 150 flags to fit the highlighter pens and they don't. I have spent alot of time trying to find refills for the pens and still can't find them."
2,Watch Shipping!,"Post It Highlighter Pens are fine, but the cost of shipping is just pure evil. I have been in the shipping business and, I would suggest you just purchase from Amazon and not go off into the other sites. IF YOU DO, watch the shipping charges. Outrageous, and by the time I caught it, I could not cancel the shippment, and f I sent the item back, there would be a reshelfing charge. I would call this a ""Gotcha"" purchase and I will never do it again."
3,"living intensely, loving intensely, and a late new home","the gifts and the defects of age have always fascinated me, and this gripping story of rebuilding and building a house, a life, a relationship and a loving restingplace, at a mature age, in the little-written-about society of contemporary Hungary, in a village little changed since medieval times, was a page-turner for me. It's one of those books which make you like people more - all the people in it, even the most tardy and inefficient workman. It is infused with the plucky, anxious, wonderfully open-to-happiness personality of its heroine, the writer, and has a strong, silent hero in her husband. A pro-life book, in every sense"
4,Very Amusing,"I agree with several other readers in that this isn't Bryson's best book. However, that doesn't keep it from being a funny, quick read into how Bryson sees Europe.Throughout this book, Bryson recconects with a European vacation he took with his friend Katz after college. He wants to revisit the places he saw - now, of course, with a much more jaded eye. He visits some new places too, among them the Arctic circle and Rome. Rome was for me the funniest part of the book - particularly Bryson's take on his travel guides!Are his observations always on target, and always kind? No, of course not. But, it's still an interesting look at how an American (who writes humor for a living) sees a different culture."
3,perfect for commute...,"I purchased this book because I was looking for something ""light"" to read on my morning commute... The book has its moments and it is enjoyable- however, I did find it surprising how Bryson, who obviously travels frequently and extensively, seems not very sophisticated and frankly monotone... His descriptions sometimes are stereotypical (like when he describes Naples-when was the last time he actually went there???)...Certainly not a great travelogue, but entertaining at times. Despite the shortcomings, I still enjoyed reading it on my train : )"
2,Outmoded -- don't waste your money,"Unless you're really into ""humorous"" stories about travelling gone awry, don't waste your money on this book. The theme of the aloof American traveller getting into a mess abroad with chattering, irrational foreigners is outmoded and trivial. Bryson is obnoxiously critical of Europeans and their ways, making this book, in spite of its occasional tolerably funny passages, one of the most ridiculous and unpalatable books I've read in a long while. I get the impression that Bryson the American feels he is always right and the childish Europeans are always wrong and immature."
3,"This is not about Europe, but still funny","Although the book is loosely based on Bryson's old and new travels through Europe, you learn remarkably little about the continent. This is because Mr Bryson himself is too preoccupied with high cost of orange juice in hotels and memories of his teenage travels with a flatulence-happy friend to notice anything of interest.Shallow anti-German and anti-Austrian outbursts do not add value to the book, and neither do annoying complaints about the costs of food in Scandinavia. Firstly, Mr Bryson is hardly a man who finds it difficult to afford a pizza anywhere in the world, secondly, his leftist admiration of extravagant social provision in Denmark somehow does not translate into understanding where all the money comes from.This is a funny book, but you cannot help noticing that there was no need for Mr Bryson to travel to Europe: he could have produced something equally funny from his weekend trip to a supermarket or car dealer."
4,Inlcudes Lots of European Locations,"Bryson covers lots of cities and interactions with locals; his encounter with Austrians in a pub makes for chilling reading. The book is four stars rather than 5 because the light style encourages reading but the lack of maps, photos, and other exhibits prevents a 5-star award."
2,Ugly American Revisited,"I bought this book with the hopes that it would be a story of Bryson's misadventures with the imimitable Katz. Unfortunately, it seems to be a Contintent long ethnocentric rant. The only redeeming thing is that Bryson includes himself and his adopted britain in on the abuse.If you travel with as many preconceptions and make snap judgements as Bryson does, you are in for some very dissappointing trips.Paul Theroux writes with much more humor and insight."
2,Another Bryson complaint,"I've now read all of Bill Bryson's past and current work, and Neither Here nor There, with a few exceptional stories wasn't one of his best works. This seemed to be a revisiting of places he had seen much earlier, and was pretty negative on most locations in Europe since much had changed, gone down hill, or been replaced by new buildings or vistas since he had been there the first time. He tried to ""go home again"", but it didn't work out well, at least for him. Still, he does describe some interesting places and provides tips on the pleasant ones. This is a ""maybe"" selection."
2,Continuing with Cliches,"Whenever I need something to read before I fall asleep, I reach for one of Mr. Bryson's book. Since I travel a lot, people assume I love travel literature, and give me his ridiculous books as ""going away gifts."" This particular book, ""Neither here nor there"" certainly doesn't buck the trend of under-educated, under-informed, boring slop. Although I don't doubt that Mr. Bryson has traveled in Europe, his use of standard cliches has the ring of someone afraid to leave his front door, in case he might have to eat something with which he is not familiar. He pretends to know the political and cultural history of every country he visits - therefore allowing him to make the rudest and ugliest jokes...but what can we expect from an American afterall?"
2,genius? let's not go that far,"Bill is a good writer, but genius should be reserved for writers like Thomas Sowell, Marc Steyn, Shelby Steele, Dan Pipes, Victor Davis Hanson, etc. No, I don't expect everyone, sadly, to have read works by these brilliant men, of course.But anyway, a guy like Bryson, being paid to travel around Eurabia and mock people, offering his insight, should be able to produce good copy. I'd like to see more people write about the decadence, hedonism and secularism that is fueling Eurabia's rapid demise though. I know it won't be any Euros, as they cater to Islam, ignore evil, and spew hatred at the Jews just like in 1939, so hopefully more Americans will.Off tangent? Nope. Poking fun at Eurabia is different than being brutally honest. Travel books about this barbaric country where six million Jews were exterminated in unappealing.But yeah, while he's not a genius, you can call him acerbic, or, like the ""great"" John Stewart,"" ""witty."""
3,Sometimes tiresome,"Bryson is funny, and he has a knack for describing the most mundane of the situations with a very acid humor. In this book, however, too many joking gets a bit tiresome (may it was the begining of his carreer, and his style was not so sharp yet)"
3,NOT Brysons' BEST effort!,"If you want to read a captivating Bryson Title go for the Australian title, ""In a Sunburned Country"". I read that one first and then bought this one and the Appalachian Trail title, ""A Walk in the Woods."" I have to say I enjoyed the hiking book about his experiences hiking the Appalachian Trail only because he was so concerned about encountering bear. The other books haven't met the mark for me. READ ""In a Sunburned Country"" there is plenty of history and incredible accounts of what he sees and does in that book that are a lot of fun to read."
1,Can anyone say...xenophobic?,"From Bryson's descriptions of Swiss people as boring, to racist cracks about gypsies in Italy, I wonder why I am the only reviewer who felt annoyed. (Maybe he should read Isabel Fonseca's ""Bury me Standing"" and learn a little about the culture of gypsies. Sure they can be annoying, but you'd have to be a stupid schlep to get pick-pocketed as easily as he did) This is one uptight American that I wouldn't want to travel with. This is a great book for people who like to travel to foreign countries to rip on other peoples' cultures. A colossal bore."
3,"Bill Bryson is no Mark Twain, but who is?","Why not just read Mark Twain's Innocents Abroad instead? Bryson's account reads like a bad rip-off at many points, and while Twain's mockery of a typical American tourist in Europe is clearly coming from love of and respect for his fellow Americans, Bryson comes off as snobbish and superior, wishing to distance himself from all things American, quick to point out that he is an ex-pat. Also, Twain is funnier. Of course."
2,Ugly American on the loose,"Loved 'Walk in the Woods' so I bought all BB's work. I finished this one thinking BB is kind of a jerk. I am a long-time resident of Yer-up and his methods are cringe-inducing. To wit: BB never seems to reserve hotel rooms, planes or trains, yet feels the locals should see his crises as theirs. He never speaks any of the local language, yet is mystified at being misunderstood. And toward the end, BB declares that, alas, he must work his way home to the UK because his ""long-suffering wife is on her semi-annual pregnancy."" Ooooh! I'm surprised she didn't change the locks as our buddy Bill pranced around Europe on a protracted midlife-crisis tour."
4,Excellent travel companion,"Bryson is a very funny writer, and this book will not disappoint. If you've ever travelled through Europe, or want to, this book is an unflinching look at many cities and countries, which will leave you laughing your tail off in many spots. Often cynical, insulting but accurate, this is a worthwhile companion to your average tour guide, and ranks up there with the best in travel books."
3,Too much topic-focused,"After reading ""A short History of Nearly everything"", and as a travel-lover, I decided to buy this book from Bill Bryson.I have to say that after reading it it left me a bittersweet sensation. On the one side it is quite funny, specially the first part of the book. However, on the other hand it is too much topic based and many times the author exagerates too much about things.On the whole, funny, but a bit out of date and at some points too biased from today's Europe."
1,A Xenophobic Traveler's Story,"I have enjoyed several of Bryson's books in the past so finally got around to this tour of Europe; I'm sorry I did. This is like one man's mid-life crisis dream of re-living an adolescent fantasy journey, with little real thought about the people in the places he visits. Sources for drink--often LOTS of drink--and the occasional museum are the primary focus of his entire journey, and the xenophobic comments that pass for humor here get very old very quickly.Probably the saddest part of the entire book was being reminded that less than 20 years ago, he could visit Sarajevo and watch families playing quietly in a park. For anyone like me who is just now considering reading this, don't. There are far better, more current travel books and far better Bryson books out there, so do yourself a favor and skip this one."
3,Not Bryson's Best,"I've read a number of Bryson's books and this is by far the weakest one in my opinion. It's not terrible, but Bryson seems to be traveling just for the sake of crossing cities off of his to-visit list. He has a great writing style, but he seems to have very few really intriguing experiences and spends so little time interacting with the locals that you wonder why he bothers leaving home. If you want a more entertaining and informative story about traveling in Western Europe, consider reading my book, ""Searching for the Holy Grail: My Travels in Western Europe."""
1,Neither Good Nor Worth It! Truly Awful,"I was totally dissappointed that the author of so many wonderful and compelling travelling stories could produce such a blatantly offensive novel. Neither Here Nor There is nothing more than a rambling, stereotypical take on Europe and its people. Absent is any of the charm, wit, and carefully constructed observations of people and places that are the hallmarks of his other books."
5,Travel Writing At Its Very Best,"Travel Writing is very difficult to do well. There's a balance to be struck between simply telling the reader about the places you're passing through (which might as well be a guidebook), and entertaining him (which risks not talking about the travel, and talking about something else). Bill Bryson strikes that balance perfectly. He captures the spirit of the places he visits accurately, whilst at the same time managing to be genuinely funny. His love of Italy and contempt for the Austrians are heartfelt, and come over so strongly because of his tone of voice. That really is the most remarkable aspect. He uses a friendly, lively, approachable tone that feels just like a conversation with an old friend, whilst still keeping his descriptive prose stylish enough to be evocative of the places he sees. Great stuff."
5,This book is the best,"I read Neither Here Nor There a week after returning from my inter-rail trip around Europe, at the same age as Bryson was and with a friend...who is nothing like Katz. This book just captured so many of my experiences as a European traveller, and as a European. He is spot on about so many things, particularly France, Austria and Germany. Indeed the similarities were almost uncanny when he talks about the hotel he stayed in on his honeymoon which he was distraught to find is now a Holiday Inn. We walked past this hotel in question every day from our hotel around the corner!! A fantastically funny read- the right length - or the stereotypes could become grating - if they weren't so correct most of the time."
2,Mediocre at best,"Sure he's kind of funny, but this book was more frustrating than rewarding for me. Bryson here seems to be extraordinarily ethnocentric and much of the humor is from looking down on other cultures. He offers observations but no real insight and is more like a spoiled kid on a trip than a travel writer. I did learn one good thing about the bizarre Capuchin Monk tomb in Rome, other than that the book was a waste. I abandoned it in a foreign hotel room- not even worth carrying home to the used bookstore."
3,Funny but superficial.,"Bryson is a good deal funnier and more mature than, say, Jeff Greenwald, but he falls into the trap of not meeting enough locals and padding his book with initially-amusing-but-eventually-repetitious accounts of surly service workers and mediocre hotels. He helpfully weaves tips on traveler's checks and museums into some of his anecdotes."
4,Laugh out loud funny,"During my recent trip to Europe, I decided to read this book since I enjoyed his other book Walk in the Woods. It was well worth it. The book was extremely funny, even to the point where I would laugh out loud during the middle of train trips.There were parts of the book that were probably exaggerated for effect but nonetheless the entire book was entertaining and well worth the read."
2,Numbingly unfunny,"About as unfunny a book as I've read recently. Bryson's attempt to force a funny expression into every other sentence makes the experience of reading this akin to spending a few hours with a hack comedian who's trying out his new material on you. I found the humor forced, smug, and really pretty mean spirited...unless you like petty jabs at the expense of the overweight and acne-scarred, and tired sterotypes about Germans, Swiss, etc., leave this title on the shelf."
2,He Shoulda Stayed Home,"I loved Bryson's book about Britain but this and his book about America just fall flat. The US book confirmed that following American interstates is dull as dirt, but hey, I already knew that. The Europe book skates around the Continent combining a lack of depth and humor in a deadly fashion. It's not bad; it's just that I suspect that Bill Bryson is really funny for one book and then he wears thin. Perhaps, however, the Britain book is great because he knows the foibles of his subject well, but sashaying around Europe gives him just enough time to do a few snap judgements."
4,Not a balanced view of Europe: 19 out 22 Chapters are on Western Europe,"PROS:- Bryson's writing style is fluid and funny.- Good coverage of Western Europe: 19 out of 22 chapters are on it.CONS:- The subtitle of the book is, ""Travels in Europe"", but it should have been called ""Travels in Western Europe"" since that's where 90% of the book takes place.- Bryson has minimal interaction with Europeans, only interacting with the locals briefly, even though he traveled alone. He seems to travel with his guidebook in hand, looking at buildings, but not really spending much time getting to know the people. Part of that probably is that he doesn't speak a foreign language well.- Not terribly informative.CONCLUSION: Don't expect to learn that much about Europe, but do expect to laugh out loud. If those are your expectations, then you will love this book. I gave it 4 stars because it was so funny, so entertaining, that it overcame the flaws I listed."
3,enjoy funny and crazy experiences with Bill!!!,"Bryson is very descriptive about his travel to Europe. He shares his opinions and thoughts (good and bad) with the reader about every place he explores. Also, he shares his view as an American observing completely different cultures. Bryson reminds that each place is different and unique and to simply enjoy your journey. Bryson shares with the reader his hilarious experiences in these strange yet unique places. Overall, this is a very funny book which goes into detail about different cities, towns and people in Europe."
3,Not as good as his other books,"I was quite curious to see what Bryson would make of Milan, the city where I live. I'd already read quite a few of his other books so I was looking forward to an interesting, intelligent read. Instead, I was amazed: the man was unable to find a coffee shop in the centre of town.This makes me have my doubts about Bryson as a travel writer. If he couldn't find a coffee shop in a town that has at least two on every block, who knows how many other things he is wrong about? Can I trust his observations on other countries?On the positive side, the book is amusing, the anecdotes about his youth are funny and his observations are interesting even if after a while they become somewhat trite and predictable. They usually run along the lines of ""Why would anyone in their right mind tear down this <insert word here> to put up a modern <insert word here>""). This is a book that's certainly worth reading, even if it's not worth taking seriously."
5,"hilarious, excellent gift!","I bought this book for an aquaintance, a young guy with a good sense of humor and dreams of backpacking across europe, and couldn't resist reading it before passing it on. It really is hysterical, moving at a less tedious pace than some of his other travelogues. Bryson's ability to ridicule others (and himself!) and have it come off as endearing not an insult is remarkable, and the humor isn't forced, suprisingly poignant observations blend right in. The gift was quite a hit!"
5,Excellent,I read this on a recent trip to Europe and could relate to many of the places Bryson describes. It is absolutely hilarious in places and laugh out loud stuff.
2,Depressing,"I didn't like it. It is the first book of Bill Bryson's I have read, and probably won't read another one. I have also traveled extensively in Europe, and similiar to Bryson, never planned my hotels, etc. But while I always have a good time, he just seems to dislike everything. It depressed me to picture him traveling through Europe, being that negative. Skip this book, and read an intelligent and interesting travel book, like something by David Hatcher Childress."
3,Could have been so much more,"This audio book of Bill Bryson's is not bad, but the abridgement really hurt it. The parts in the book concerning Katz was deeply needed in order to liven up the audiocassette. Sadky, this was not done.It has many great moments, such as when Bryson comments on the idiosyncies of various nations, but the good parts are rather far in between."
5,important narration on personal courage & humanity,"This true story reveals humanity's deepest capacity for evil, and also its strongest drive to nurture, protect, and do good. It is a demonstration of the depths to which one can be pushed when survival is the basic need.A most important, riveting read. It should be required reading for any political science classroom or discussion on the nature of the human. I strongly recommend this for any book club. You won't be able to put it down."
3,"Compelling story, somewhat biased","An important read especially for those who do not know a great deal about Greece's modern history. However it does, somewhat understandably given the author's involvement, have a rather anti-left bias. Therefore, I strongly recommend that readers who enjoy this novel also read at least one of the many novels that demonstrate the atrocities that were committed TOWARDS those on the left (eg. Achilles' fiancée by Alki Zei ASIN: 9600404801), in order to gain a more balanced picture of historical events in Greece."
1,Don't believe the hype,"As a descendant of Greek partisans in the Civil War it is important for me to tell you that the story tries to diminish their cause, Greece ended up in the hands of foreigners and fascists because of their defeat.The story of the book is powerful, but it is wrong to think that it is decisive enough to say which side was right or wrong."
2,It was no Con Air,"I'm generally not into reading, but I decided that I would give this one a shot, expecting it to be as good as Face/Off. Boy was I mistaken. Cage should stick to acting. Do you remember in Snake Eyes when he punched that guy in the face? Do you remember in Boy in Blue when he punched that guy in the face? I enjoyed those moments more than I enjoyed reading Cage's book, or reading anything for that matter."
5,Terrifying and Touching,"Nicholas Gage (Nicola Gatzoyiannis)wrote a book that was both terrifying and touching. It was terrifying because it exposed the brutality of Communism and touching because it told of a woman's undying love for her children, especially the boy who would one day pay tribute to her. The descriptions of torture Eleni and fellow villagers endured at the hands of the ELAS/DAG were some of the most horrifying things I've ever read. The scene where Eleni tells her son, Nicola, to be brave and gives him a gift of a cross is one of the most touching scenes of family love I've ever read about. This story is a must-read for everyone. It is both instructive about the moral degradation caused by Communism and about the courage of a family. Also read Nicholas Gage's followup, ""A Place for Us: Eleni's Children in America,"" which chronicles events leading up to Gage's life today. Excellent writer!"
5,"Wonderful,Intense,Emotional,Educational & Informative",My in-laws are from Greece & they lived during this time period so the book was very enlightening. The strength of the Greek women & children during such a terrible time touched me & I pray for the souls of those who died.
3,"Eleni is wonderful, the book is okay","The book, Eleni by Nicholas Cage, is about the author's mother and their life in war-torn Greece in the 1940's. It starts out wonderfully, drawing us into their rugged life in the mountains as well as the politics of the time. Then it bogs down with so much minutiae that you feel like you are trying to swim in a mud pond and can no longer imagine the other shore. Yet, my cousin recommended this book to me as her favorite biography of recent years, so one could say there is an individual experience of this book and it just didn't click for me personally. I will say that the topic is compelling and important, and the subject, Eleni, is inspiring."
5,What a book?,"Ironically, the reader enjoys the story because of the compelling way Nicholas Gage describes his pain and tragedy. I've rarely read a book that I just couldn't put down, this is one of them. I too am a Greek American, my own mother's name is Eleni and my younger brother's name is Niko, so I could just imagine the close bond Nicholas Gage (the baby of the family) and his mother had. I think this book does an amazing job of describing just how cruel people can be to each other in a Civil War."
3,"Eleni, Great story of a trying time in the world.","The Greek Civil War 1944-1949 is one of the most interesting of thecommunist/ left/ socialist/ insurrections in the 20th century.The Communists were so routed that in the waning days of that War,that they took to stealing children to indoctrinate back in Russia.This is a great story about that horrible time in Greece.It is the story of a mothers love of her family and her neighbors."
3,Pays off in the end,"This book is written well, but it is a hard read. I didn't think it really grabbed me until about 244 pages in. It is worth it in the end, but you have to want to finish it (or in my case, be required to) in order to enjoy."
5,One of the most powerful books written,Mr.Gage spoke at my college graduation and spoke about his mother Eleni. I pick up the book and was moved to tears.
1,Scam,"This company is advertising 1 pound of R12 & R134a Valve Cores - Standard (2672). Item Weight: 1 pound Shipping Weight: 1 pound ASIN: B0002JMEPI Amazon Bestsellers Rank: #18,773 in Automotive (See Top 100 in Automotive)#79 in Automotive > Tools & Equipment > Air Conditioning Tools & Equipment > Air Conditioning Line Repair ToolsThe truth is I paid $2.29 for one tiny valve core in a oversized box when it could have been sent in a envelope with no problem. With the large box there was $5.95 in shipping and don't forget the $0.59 in tax for a grand total of $8.83. One valve core in a small plastic bag. I could have picked one up on a tire shop floor. The valve may have the weight of a needle or small paper clip. This is not what was advertised. A pound of valve cores would have been hundreds if not a thousand."
2,Not recommended for the beginner in statistics,"This book is touted as the ""nonstatisticians quick reference to applied categorical data analysis"" It is very abstractly presented and does not meet this goal. It is not popular with me or among my biostatistics classmates. This book will collect dust on my shelf when the class is finished."
4,"Pretty good book, very step-by-step","Mathematical level: LowThis is a relatively short book (290 pages). It provides a good introduction at a relatively nontechnical level, but cannot be considered the `final word', since some of the details which are left out are important. One strength (or possibly weakness) of this book is that it gives detailed calculations in many places. This is a strength because it makes the book easier to follow (particularly for those whose algebra is a little rusty); it is a weakness because it gets boring and because it makes the ""effective"" size of the book even smaller."
2,Not so luxurious,"These gloves are OK, but not as luxurious as the vendor name would imply.Not as supple as we had hoped. Return policy essentially makes returning them a waste of time."
2,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,"It works, but barely holds together and you have to REALLY play with it to get it to work.Really shoddy manufacturing."
1,"Not a good product, dont buy it ...","I purchased two, thinking I could give one to my mom. I go it in the mail and opened it up, the first one was missing a part and I couldn't set it up. The second one had all the parts, but was not able to hold the weight of my dryer. I was not happy and had to pay $20+ to return it. If you are going to buy this at least keep the box it comes in so you can return it."
1,Not worth buying,This stand does not stay in position. It is very cheap and not worth the money I paid. The part that is suppose to hold the hair dryer is very weak.The stand itself falls over at the slightest touch. The pole does not stay in the long position and is very hard to adjust. Please don't waste your money. Wish I would have read the reviews before buying.
2,Junk,This junky apparatus fell apart in less than 2 months. The plastic clips that hold the dryer snapped off on the first uses. That was the end of it standing up on its own. After that I used the velcro to hold the dryer but it slipped off over and over. I am now shopping for a better one. Don't waste you money on this one!!
1,"Very flimsy, bad product","This stand was not worth buying. It does not screw from the middle properly, so the top part of the stand continuously falls without support. Also the screws given were not adequate and the stand was always shaky and wobbly. The hairdryer fit fine in the upper clamp part, however, the stand is very cheaply designed and did not do the job at all. Would NOT recommend."
5,Great CD,Well the price is as good as it gets and the music of the master Buddy Guy. Great combo. I highly recommend this.
3,THE MAN,If you like Blues-Rock you will like this album. But for Hard core Texas\Chicago sounds steer clear. Better albums: (1) Damn Right (2) Heavy Love (3) Steppin In -- all of these are better albums.
4,90% Chance of Rain,"First off I love this CD and listen to it all the time. The only reason I gave this CD 4 stars is that this album is very Heavily produced and at times get a little to slickish for my liking. Listen to ""Sufferin' Mind"" to see what I mean. But still the production doesn't alter the fact that this is a good album."
5,Perfect & Quick,I have always wanted this doll. Years ago I searched high and low with no success. I received it quickly in perfect condition. Thanks!
4,Definitely a classic,A must see and a classic. I just couldnt put it up there with the 5's but its a keeper. Excellent monk techniques and some exciting weapons display. You cant go wrong here. Another Shaw brothers classic.
3,It barely flies,"If you're a Christopher Reeve fan, you'll like this movie. If not, then you're in for just another ""surviving-in-the-wilderness"" tale of an American mail pilot in one of the last days of flying before pilots actually carried passengers. Reeve does a good job of portraying Edgar, a former WW1 flight instructor who's trying to overcome the scars of the death of a student. He crashes in the mountains in the midst of a mail run with a brat of a girl played by Arquette. Surviving with little food, plagued by the cold, hunger and a pack of mean wolves, Reeve triumphes in the end. You didn't expect anything less of Superman now didja?"
2,title says it all,"Christopher Reeve plays a stiff unfriendly jerk in the beginning of this movie. It shows the perils of flying, and one comes away with the idea that only idiots would endanger themselves by climbing ina biplane. The photagraphy is good, the scenery wonderful, the terrain is rugged, the acting is poor in my opinion. After the plane crashes the movie only has the two actors fighting with one another. They eventually decided to like each other, of course.It's really not a great movie unless you like airplanes like I do."
2,The aviator,"Based on a very good book from E.K. Gann, this movie is unfortunately of less quality. Good adventure movie anyway."
4,SUPERMAN,a very good movie. i've enjoyed it. i found it difficult to watch C. reeve. still miss him.
2,Read the Book,"If you had read the book, you would know how disappointing this movie is. Actually, reading the book now would show you what I mean.The ony commonality between movie and the book is that a mailplane crashed and had a passenger, but the passenger was a young child and it wasn't the pilot who was injured. It is a great book. Can't say so much about the movie.Bare"
5,The best cleanser for my eczema,"I have eczema (red, tight, shiny, pustule spotted, very sensitive) only on my face. it gets old explaining to people what is on my face. My dermatologist was giving me the steroid of the month and it never really went away or felt like normal skin. I've even been tested for allergies and tried acupuncture. Then the allergist suggested this cleanser in combo with Vanicream moisturizer before my skin dries. Its been a miracle. I highly recommend. It's like Cetaphil in mildness but seems to clean better as I dont have eczema on my forehead."
4,Great for sensitive skin and those sensitive to perfumes,"Free and Clear certainly is what it promotes--it is a great cleanser for anyone who has any sensitivities, be they to harsh chemicals or to overpowering scents. It washes well, there's no offensive scent and it leaves the skin smooth. I have only used it on my face, so this is what I'm basing my review on.I didn't give it five stars because I don't notice any great improvement to my skin. However, it doesn't irritate my skin and it doesn't leave it feeling tight after washing, so it has been a good cleanser to use."
4,Good Cleanser,"My dermatologist recommended I use this cleanser, along with a retinoid and a good moisturizer. It is unscented, has a good lather, and it cleans well, including removing most of my eyeshadow. Doesn't do great at removing waterproof eye makeup. I will definately purchase again when my first bottle runs out."
1,Drying!,I was so hopeful after reading all of the positive reviews for this cleanser but it was way too drying! I have sensitive/dry skin and I'm 20 years old. I started washing with this as directed by the instructions but almost immediately I started getting flakey around my nose area and chin area. I thought maybe my skin would balance out after I kept using it but I was wrong. I developed small bumps on my cheeks and forehead and continued to get really dry/flakey skin. I have stopped using it and even after a week my skin isn't back to what it was before.
1,Not For My Sensitive Skin,This product is suppose to be for sensitive skin but it irritated my skin @ was too drying. This may be good for other people but not for me.
4,Good Cleanser - No Breakouts,"Like some of the other reviewers, I do find it a little drying. My skin is very sensitive and does not react kindly to cleansers of any kind. I appreciate that it is fragrance and sulfate free and I have not had any major breakouts since using this cleanser so for those reasons I give it four stars, if it was more moisturizing I would give it 5 stars."
3,Too Light,The balls are ok but light compared to other brands. We use 3-star balls from two other brands and they are heavier and more controlled.
1,very dissatisfied,"I purchased champion ping pong balls recently; the product was described as the following:""Champion Sports 3 Star White Table Tennis Balls One Dozen Ping Pong Balls""Either the product description which is provided by the seller is deceptive or something else happened because I paid for two dozen ping pong balls but I got only a dozen in the box that I received today."
5,"Terrific, as usual","As a long time fan of Greenleaf and Marsh Tanner, I thoroughly enjoyed Strawberry Sunday. I love books that inform and challenge me as well as entertain, and can always count on this author to accomplish that.A rumor has been circulating that Greenleaf planned to retire the Tanner series, and with the last book seemed to have done so, in a most excruciating way. With this book, Marsh has been returned to me and I can imagine him, one of the rare really good people, continuing to do what he does best."
1,Item is worth no more than $15,My opinion that this DVD is no more than $15.00 and here they selling it at $85.00 WHAT A RIP OFF...
4,"****Very Good, Not A Dull Moment","Another fine Canadian rock band from the eighties. Kinda in the Loverboy, Prism camp. The albums from the eighties were good, but this kicks everything up a notch. Even if you have the greatest hits, you are missing their best work if you do not have this. Not a dull moment.Waking the Jester"
5,Great Book!!,Great book I recommend everyone to read it don't waste your time with the ones you don't need. This is the book to get it gets to the point.
4,Some Afterthoughts,"I reviewed this book before, but now I have some afterthoughts to share. Compatibility, no matter how many facets or points, only goes so far. Science is a great tool, and yes, is very helpful even in interpersonal relationships. But there are things that are immeasurable; things intangible that can't be measured and put on a chart and analyzed. I can't put a finger on it myself. My point is....it only goes so far. It does not apply to everybody; nor does it work all the time. You can have a successful, happy marriage based on just a few compatibilities, and everything else works because the couple are very much in love; enough that they work things out! Believe me, working things out covers a multitude of incompatibilities, and so does love. But it's real love that I'm talking about. This book is very helpful. But it's only part of what you need to know, and part of what you need to do to find your soulmate."
2,The title of the book should be How to Use eHarmony,"I found reading this book to be a waste of time. It's a very light book and can be read cover to cover in an hour or two. The whole book reads like an ad for eHarmony. Everything in this book is geared toward how to fill out your profile on eHarmony. Just like most online dating sites, this book makes date/mate selection sound like your shopping for a new car. It makes it sound like all that is needed to find your soul mate is to figure out what you like and don't like in a partner, enter it into the computer, and poof, your soul mate will magically appear exactly to your specifications."
5,An excellent read,"This is possibly the best book I've ever read on relationships. The book helps you identify what you are looking for in a relationship and also what you need. It is practical, realistic and easy to apply. If you are genuinely looking for a partner, this book provides the tools to help you get started in the right direction."
2,If only life was so black and white.,"The whole premise of the book is that everyone has the same definition of honesty, financial stability, spirituality ect. If you acknowledge different people have different interpratations of these things the book falls fat on its face."
1,Best Use for Book: Killing Roaches in Your Room,"I am always on the lookout for worthwhile relationship self-help books. This, unfortunately, is not one. The recommendations are largely superficial at best, with few or no original points or slants. The author fails to mention the import of ""soulmate"" connection. Although his intentions may be good, he seems to have ""dispatched the job"" of writing this book in favor of displaying his ego and advertising his eHarmony website, which male customers should avoid like the plague. In both book and website, the author demonstrates that his ""foolproof system"" actually features more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. It is better that unattached males and females seek other avenues for insights into successful relationships."
3,Eh. Things we should kind of know already.,I thought this book was okay. I found myself getting bored with the repetitive ideas and theories of dating. I thought this book was a big propoganda to make money for e-Harmony. A lot of the thoughts of this book should also be common sense when looking for a life partner. Worth a read if you fell completely lost in the dating world. You can also get the same info from the the E-Harmony website.
4,Very Insightful,I have read several of Dr. Warrens books and this one is just as good. It's a very easy read. I finished the 200 pages in 2 days. You should also give eharmony a try. It is working for me.
3,Hard to find CD,Thank you for the CD. I just wish that you had the DVD series of this animee on sale as well.
1,"Free INFORMATION, not free STUFF.","This book's title is deceiving. It does not help you find samples or items. Instead, it's written to help an internet newbie find information about gardening. It's loaded with URLs of websites to help you in your gardening adventures, but it does not offer free STUFF, like the title implies. It only offers free information. And it does NOT help you find anything you couldn't find by yourself. By buying the book, it negates the claim of anything being free... you have to pay for the information to find more information."
1,Publishing date,I really should have checked the publishing date before I bought this--it is now 8 years old and all of the URLs I have checked so far have been defunct. I also thought it was going to be free things and not just information.
5,Tapping The Source,Volumes 1 & 2 of these live recordings are gems. Dex and Mac are hugely inspired in each other's company and the rhythm section is cookin' on all burners. The eighteen minute romp through Miles Davis' 'Half Nelson' is one of the exuberant highlights of this disc. Highly recommended listening.
5,wha???,what on EARTH is that ^ product description supposed to be????????????? this is a film about the mentally ill having to be jailed to get treatment.
5,Fast-track diagnosis of Reading Readiness,"This book is designed for use with an observation survey determining a child's reading readiness and his/her concepts about print. Some pages have the words in strange order, some pages are upside-down, and so on, although superficially it looks like a ""normal"" book. It is illustrated and has big type, the illustrations facing the type pages. In line with the California Reading Initiative and the assembly bills requiring informed diagnosis of children's reading readiness and progress, and multiple assessments thereof, this is a valuable diagnostic tool for children entering school, to be used with the test script on page 47-48 of Marie Clay's An Observation Survey of Early Literacy Achievement."
3,Good for Gym bad for everything else.,"This product is OK. When I took it out of the box, I was very dissapointed at the reception of my local radio stations. However, when I took it to the gym (which was it's intended purpose) I was able to easily pick up all of the local broadcasts in the gym.Also they made a small design mistake on the armband. You need to twist the band to make the velcro work.I do not recommend this product for use other than in a gym with local broadcasts. You might need to pay a bit more and get the Sony for other uses."
2,Not so good...,"The radio has very poor reception. Really I don't know if I would recommend, but the product os not so good..."
3,Coby CX-96 Review,This model is adequate. I am an avid radio listener and have purchased every digital personal radio available for the last 25 years. The absolute best will always be the SONY SRF-M32 but they were discontinued years ago. The Coby CX-96 is a reasonable replacement and even includes a few features that are improvements over the Sony. But the reception is nowhere near the Sony's capability and it definitely needs a BELTCLIP instead of the armband. Best of Luck.
3,Nice for the price,"It works fine for the gym, didn't care for the armband strap. The earbuds worked fine for me."
4,you get what you pay for,i bought this item because i wanted a cheap portable radio.prosgood sound quality.cheap.easy to use.consbatteries drain very fast.a bit bigger then i expected.the armband is useless.overall i am satisfied with it.
1,Not what is in the picture.........,"Although description does not mention TV tunning,the image is misleading since it shows ""TV"" besides AM and FM. Future buyers should know; what you see is not what you get. I will have to buy another unit with TV tunning for the gym."
1,WORST SERVICE,"I have ordered this Coby CX-96 arm band radio about 1 month ago. They sent to me first time damaged Coby CX-96. I informed amazon.com about this problem. Than amazon sent to me new one Coby CX-96 for free, I was vary pleased BUT after that they request to send back the damaged Coby CX-96. I wrote that in our poor country we have not such a service and I could't send back Coby CX-96 and I ask them not to charge my credit card because it was their mistake. BUT they did not foresee my trouble and my request and charge my credit card. They have the worst service I have ever seen. BE CAREFUL NOT TO HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM WITH AMAZON!!! I AM VARY ANGRY!!!!!!!!!!"
2,No,"For the price, I got what I paid for, it doesn't receive stations very well and doesn't sync with TVs at the gym"
2,Buyer Beware,"Was looking for a good, digital AM/FM radio of minimal size. This one's features looked great. I had good luck with Coby products in the past but this model was a letdown. It was a bit bigger than I hoped. The digital tuning feature works good but it's a little too battery hungry for my taste. A BIG drawback I see though is that the print labeling on the soft touch-pad type controls started to wear off within 2 weeks of (not heavy) use. For the money, look elsewhere. This one will not hold up."
1,Did not meet expectations,"Bought this because one reviewer said it picked up distant stations. It does not. I normally use a Sony personal radio that I wanted to replace, the Sony was better."
1,Not the best,I bought this radio primarily to be used during my hikes. The reception goes from pretty bad to awful as we go farther into the hike.The mechanism used to attach the radio to the armpiecs is flimsy and the radio keeps getting disengaged from the armband.Avoid this model.
1,This is a piece of junk. Save your money -- don't buy it.,"There's not much more I can add to that, except to provide some details. Principally, it it can't provide a clear signal for powerful stations in Boston. For instance, WGBH is has such a good signal that you can get it 50 miles away in your car, but right here in town, the Coby can barely pick it up, and if you run by a building, the signal fuzzes out. Most annoyingly, the Coby randomly switches bands on its own so that for instance you'll have it set on WGBH (89.7), and it will just switch you to 89.6, again causing the signal to deteriorate. It's pretty much the worst radio I've ever encountered."
1,Terrible purchase,"I bought this little radio because the gym that I go to broadcasts their TV channels over FM radio, so I just wanted a simple radio with an FM tuner - nothing fancy. This device didn't even meet those standards, which I thought were pretty low to begin with. I have used this less than 20 times and have already had to replace the batteries once, and it's to the point where I can't read the display at all so I have no idea what station I'm listening to. The only time I can read the display is when it's turned off. I consider myself to be pretty decent when it comes to programming devices (VCRs, TVs, clocks, etc) but I really couldn't figure out how to set the memory channels. I will be throwing this away today because I'm absolutely tired of fighting with this thing. Don't buy. Spend $5 more and get something that's worth the money."
4,decent product,"I have tried other radios for the gym and have not been happy, this is decent as far as reception and ease of use. reading other peoples reviews and explanationin regards to the band made it easier to use. all in all I am happy especially for the price.I would reccomend this product"
2,Not so hot,"There are a number of problems with this radio. It's as if someone just slapped this together without any fore thought. For instance, the arm band has all the velcro on the same side. This means that when you wrap it around your arm, you have to twist it, or you end up with velcro on a smooth surface. My main problem is with the controls. In order to change channels, you have to cycle through the whole 10 presets in order. In other words, if you're on channel 2, and want to get to channel 1, you have to go from 3 through 10, and then to one. There is a button for the band, and you can just switch between the same two AM and FM channels, but if you listen to more than two, it takes an effort. If you're jogging or bicycling, it takes away from the fun. The sound isn't too bad, but nothing to write home about."
2,worthless armband,"The radio works fine, but the armband is worthless. The sewing of the velcro is incorrect and does not attach!"
3,portable digital tuner am/fm radio,"There are very few 1 piece am/fm radios with digital tuners. Sony used to make one [mine broke] and a few others on the market are heavy. This item is pretty cute, attaching it to your arm is tricky and doesn't get better with experience. Reception in commercial buildings ie exercising etc. is spotty except for the very strongest of am stations [and even that varies]."
2,"junk, but cheap","I'm having a hard time saying something good about this radio. The earbuds area joke. The reception wasn't very good on any station, and I live in a major metropolitan area. The volume levels are not very sensitive, it's either too loud or not loud enough. The process of setting the station presets is fairly complicated. I only had mine for about two weeks, before I was fumbling with it(awkwardly trying to change stations while on a run) and dropped it on the sidewalk. When I turned it back on, all I could hear was a loud buzzing sound. Fed up, I tossed it in a garbage can and continued on my way. The only thing I miss are the batteries. The only good thing I can say is that the armband works great. You just have to to have a loop of velcro through both ends of the radio (there will be a closure on both ends with the fuzzy side out). All things considered, it's still a cheap radio..."
1,don't buy,"bad design for the attach belt, it is o way to work out to attach on arms.plus FM radio quality is not acceptable"
3,Fair to Middling,"AM reception in Baltimore is pretty good. Surprisingly, FM is not that great. Some local FM stations do not come in very clearly. I was not able to figure out how to use the arm band, so I just took the elastic arm band off my old broken radio and put it on this one. Difficult to cruise the preset stations as you can only go in one direction (i.e. 1 to 2 to 3, but not from 3 back to 2). If you pass the preset that you wanted, you have to go all the way to 10 and back around again. Batteries seem to burn out fairly quickly.All that being said, you can't expect too too much for the price. So I am not ""disappointed"", but it would have been a nice susprise if the above problems did not exist."
3,Coby Alll weather sport radio,"I love the fact that I can program my favorite stations and the hold button so I don't accidently change / push a button while I am adjusting it for the hundredth time. The Radio often moves (slips around) while running / exercising so frequently, numerous re-adjustments are necessary. Then if the velcro closures are in the wrong spot (such as, near inside of arm) they will rub and irritate your skin. In addition, the Radio I rec'd in the mail had the velcro closures sewn on the wrong way - I did the repair myself. It's a great option for people who can't afford MP3 players but the concept was not executed correctly. I would suggest the design team go back to the drawing board."
3,Not so great but ok,"First of all this radio is easy to use, however the reception could be better. The arm band works well and is comfortable but the flimsy plastic tabs that hold the radio to the holder broke right off and I had to use some velcro to reattach it. I wouldn't recommend trying to run or do anything active with it or it will fall off the arm band. But if you're just sitting around or mowing the grass it is fine. The headphones are junk, but if you have a good set it sounds good. Overall it's a get what you pay for item. Not great and not bad either. If you just want a good cheap radio this will work."
2,Meh! Not gonna reccomend this one.,"Price is cheap but so is the performance. I stopped listening to AM stations because of the constant fading in and out. To my disappointment FM had the same problem. If you're standing still it works fairly well, but walking or jogging will drive one insane. The radio size is a bit on the large side and the strap would possibly fit better if I had a larger arm diameter. I will say that the UI is very easy to use and presets are nice way to skip the radio commercials. One last note: even at the lowest volume setting it is way too loud."
5,family favorite,"My mother had this book when she was little, and my children wanted a copy since my mom is no longer living. Sweet pictures and classic feel. Thanks!"
5,This Cookbook Hits The Spot,I bought three of the cookbooks in this series and love them all. My family loves pasta and this book has many easy and tasty recipes. I bought this because it has many pictures of the dishes which is a must for me. I like the fact that it gives the fat and cholesterol content per serving. The recipes include both cold and hot dishes with varied ingredients. No more boring pasta for this family.
5,Makes you yearn for the ocean!,"Beautiful, inviting pictures and thoroughly re-readable text, this is the story of how Alice overcomes her fear of deep water with the aid of some friendly dolphins.My two year old loves having this read to her, she points to the pictures of the dreamy underwater world and squeals wth delight, 'She's swimming!!!' Older children will enjoy reading it themselves, and perhaps they will come to see that their own fears can be overcome too."
2,Low grade metal,"The item looks just as it is represented. However, I doubt this is 440 grade stainless and, if it is, it is likely 440A grade not 440C. I used it to trim a shrub on my patio and several a 1/2"" bends and dents appeared in the edge of the blade; and a 1-1/2"" section of the edge chipped off. The shrub was a soft wood and certainly not formidable against any blade. I would characterized this item for decorative use. I am going to try to return it. So if you are shopping for looks only its a good buy."
3,ok,"Seems to be of fairly good metal. Totally useless holes in blade. Sharp, poor quality sheath. Balance a bit off. Ok as a machete for camping, but not sure how long it will last."
4,i love it except for the sheath,the machete it self is great except for the sheath the strap tht goes on ur back literately broke with in the first 30 sec of having it im just going to make mine out of leather which i suggest u do
3,Carry Quality,"If the sheath was even half as decent as the blade, it would be well worth the purchase. The scabbard really stinks..A good Leather scabbard would make this a great purchase."
3,Good Machete for the price,"Bought it for 8dls, the shipping confirmation had a little delay but everything was send it on time.This is machete is thicker than the regulars, so makes it fabulous for a nice swing and to cut small trees or chop tree branches, clear your path and so many things more-The wholes are suppose to balance the machete and is not well balance, I think you just have to get use to it.-The grip, I have small hands and I think is just not quite long, I added a Tennis racquet grip the sticky ones and help so much, totally change the experience.-It comes already sharp, but the fact that is stainless steel 440 you will have to sharp it very often(i recommend a diamond sharper)-The sheath, now is brand new but it seems that is no going to last for long, maybe a leather one will work better.I already took this machete for a backpacking, people love it, is so cool to look at it, seems like you are ready for everything. Overall is a good investment for only 16 dls(with shipping)"
2,Great Poetry Poor Formatting,"There's nothing wrong with Swinburne's verse, but this ebook has a table of contents that is useless, since it's not linked."
3,"Improved TOC, but...","Apparently the Kindle folk got the words about the Table of Contents since the last reviewer posted. Yes, it is often a problem with these free Kindle books. The Table of Contents is working now; you can click a poem and it takes you there instantly. However, you have to get through a large introduction before you even get to the Table of Contents for the poems! The TOC begins on Location 254, that's 6% of the book! Also, some of the poems I was looking for were not in this book. Again, you have to get through 6% of the person to discover that, and you won't get that far in the Sample. Then again the book is free so nothing is lost. If you get it and don't like it, just delete it. Oh well..."
5,SURE TO BECOME A CLASSIC,"This is simply the best children's book I've read in a long time. The story is compelling, surprising, and fun. The text is perfectly balanced and easy to read. My 4 year old daughter loves it, and I love to read it to her. This is one I never get tired of."
5,A favorite book with a great twist at the end,"I found this book at the library, and immediately purchased it to have at home. This is a beautifully illustrated children's story, with a fantastic twist at the very end. This is one of those children's stories that I truly enjoy reading to my 3 year old. There is plenty of rhyme and fun word choices to describe the journey of two companions, a mouse and a mole, and separately, a large bear getting hungrier and hungrier as he awaits an opportunity to eat. The illustrations perfectly capture the emotions of the characters, as they venture out into a dark and gloomy night, only to become lost. Meanwhile, the bear can no longer contain his hunger and storms out of his den. The first time we read it, I was certain the hungry bear and the two small animals were going to cross paths, with an uncertain outcome. However, the result of their meeting was unexpected. This is definitely one of our all- time favorites."
4,"Well illustrated, delightful book.","The animals have great expressions on their faces. Entertaining book with a happy ending. Just the right amount of text on each page to retain the attention of a young child (probably those on the younger side of 3-7). It only got 4 stars (3 1/2 if I had that option) because 1) there was a full moon during the dark night. 2) the bear was hungry for meat but (spoiler!) not at the end? 3) this book does not have many ""hidden things"" - we like looking at books with ""things"" hidden within each page, things that we find after reading the same book many many times. BTW, points 1 was raised by my younger son and our explanation was nights were always dark in the forest. Point 2 was raised by my older son who was (and still is) in the habit of asking insightful questions... I'm glad to get this book for a bargain but wouldn't spend the full hardcover price."
5,Amazing! A real gem of an album,"This is the first album I purchased by Lucinda Williams and I was blown away after the first listen- it is wonderful! The raw, dark, heartfelt lyrics, the musical arrangements and the recording quality all lead me to one conclusion- best album for 2007. Every song is a winner here. I need to get some more Lucinda Williams music now! Wow!"
5,Still the Angel of Ensanguined Love,"I bought this CD a week ago, and yes, Lucinda Williams is still the greatest living songwriter (though I might say she possibly currently shares that honor with Ryan Adams). The most visceral portrayal of heartbreak in verse and song ever, ever...Lucinda you are still the angel of ensanguined love."
2,Alt-country emo??,"No, really--I love Lucinda Williams. I've liked her earlier albums and I like her voice; it's a nice change in a music genre that often seems to idealize baby-voiced vocalists like Emmylou Harris, Nanci Griffith, and Iris DeMent (all of whom are fine singers, of course, but it's unusual to hear a female singer with Williams' deep, husky, voice).I found this album musically monotonous. Really monotonous. Like, sleep-inducing. I could chalk that up to personal taste and forgive it if more of the songs had lyrics that were interesting or meaningful beyond fairly standard pop fare. Too many of these, as much as I hate to think it, were warmed-over rhymes and old themes with no new insight.Get Car Wheels instead."
3,Lighten Up Already,"Ok, I love Lucinda Williams but I'm more than a little tired of all the self pity and introspection. And why she feels the need to include the f-word is beyond me.Where have the carefully woven stories and upbeat anthems of her earlier work gone? I expect insight from a middle-aged songwriter, not angst and dull repetition. Lighten it up Lucinda, I'm worried about you."
5,WEST IS BEST,"Having the majority of Lucinda's albums, I must say this is the one that stays in my CD player the most. All the songs on this album are great and some in particular will keep you thinking long after you hear them (Fancy Funeral, What If). You may want to hear ""Come On"" in private, especially away from children or the prude due to subject matter and how she lyrically gives the kiss off to a guy that ""didn't know where to put his hands"", and he couldn't even make her Come (On) (you'll get the idea at first listen). One of Lucinda's best albums, followed by Essence and A World Without Tears."
5,Lucinda versus Steve,"Lucinda Williams is the best songwriter alive today, and Steve Earle is second, although it is stupid to compare."
4,Serious music for serious folks,"A very good record, but could use more up-tempo songs and less achy-breaky-heart stuff. I'd still recommend it, but don't play it if you want your spirits lifted."
2,Not her best,"I am a Lucinda Williams fan and have been for a long time, but this CD is not her best. Many of the songs sound the same to me -- sad, slow, boring. Buy it if you're a long time fan and want to follow her career, otherwise I'd skip it."
1,So Sad,"This CD is heavy duty SAD. If you are a heroin addict, this CD may cheer you up. I only liked one song on the CD and I am a Lucinda fan. This is not a feel-good CD."
4,awesome,this is a great album and I would recomend it to all. she is a wonderful singer and I really love listening to it
3,Disappointing to a major Lucinda Williams fan,"No instant classics in this her most recent collection. Moreover, her voice sounded raspy like she's smoked too many cigarettes. With no major innovation, no instant classics and a damaged voice, this devout and major fan was very disappointed. Maybe it will grow on me but after 5 listenings, I'm still waiting."
4,like an old Neil Young album,West is gorgeous. Beautifully produced. Her voice just keeps on getting better and better. These songs ooze character.
4,Go WEST,"'West' is definately a step in the right direction after 'World Without Tears'. Vocally there isn't a lot different than Willaims has ever done. Musically, she or her producer, Hal Willner, has taken a few positive strides.I do agree with others the lead-off track is one of the weakest on this disk. The repetativeness is completely distracting and not worthy of Willams' talents. Ditto w/""Mama You Sweet"".The strongest tracks are by far ""Unsuffer Me"", ""Where is My Love"", ""Rescue"", ""What If"" and ""Wrap My Head Around It"". Especially the strings on ""Unsuffer Me"" and the guitar on ""Where is My Love"" really make the songs. They are subtle yet make all the difference.I do like ""Fancy Funeral"", though it is a little down...even for me. ""Come On"" starts really good, but it doesn't really go anywhere.The good thing is, the rest of the songs are perfectly serviceable. Nothing outstanding, but nothing making me hit the 'skip' button like I did with 'World Without Tears'."
2,a big disappointment,"Pretty much a big disappointment. Anyone of these songs would be the worst if included on Car Wheels. This album is not nearly as bleak as it has been made out to be in the reviews and not nearly as good. Come On and What If (the music of which is clearly inspired by Cortez the Killer, which you can sing right over top of her lyrics) are certainly two of the weakest songs she has written; they are borderline unlistenable with horrible lyrics. Where is My Love? and Rescue are fine, but in all, the songs suffer from a lack of specificity."
2,Very disappointed....,"that's that I was when I heard this record. Even in concert, Lucinda just seems like such a drag anymore. I know, her mom died recently, but this whole record is such a downer, and her voice just drones on and on and on.Give me Lucinda's self titled CD any day over her last 2 records..."
2,Sad,"The song titles reveal a cry for help - Are You Alright?, Unsuffer Me, Everything Has Changed, Rescue, etc.I began listening to Lucinda when I first moved to Austin, TX (mid 80's)with Happy Woman Blues & Ramblin'. She has really fallen into a glorification of her pain."
2,Sorry Lucinda,"I am a huge fan but the truth is this album is a big step down from the levels she achieved with Carwheels and continuing with her next two albums. ""I'm Learning How..."" is an absolute classic. For that alone I give the album two stars. The rest of the material ranges from mediocre to stuff that is cringeworthy. Her attempts to loosen things up and write stream of consciousness lyrics or perform in a totally spontaneous way plays to her weaknesses. Lucinda is best when she creates finely crafted songs and then works with a good producer to hone the sound of each song. Sorry Lucinda."
3,"3++ If you like Lucinda, or female rock/country","3++ If you like Lucinda, or female rock/country. Imus keeps playing a live ""Changed the Lock on My Door"". This disc has a couple of really good cuts and mostly ok songs."
2,Most Boring Album Of The Year,"I am sorry.. I just could not take this album. There are no hooks, nothing grabbing.. Just forlorn, dull, constantly repeated themes.. And, this has been a problem with the past few albums. It's one thing to live through tragedy and loss.. but, moaning about it over the same open chords gets old for an entire album.. There is just no closure, it seems. Look at all the great albums dealing with loss- Springsteen's ""The Rising"", Lou Reed's ""Magic and Loss"", Patti Smith's ""Gone Again"" and ""Tramping"", etc, and they all have some closure and moving on.. This doesn't.. it's like listening to some old drunk lady at the bar rattle on and on about how miserable she is, and that gets old really quick..I see people ranting here about ""Come On"".. that song is by far the worst song I have heard from her.. It sounds like a reject from Steve Earle's El Corazon album.."
4,West,"This CD is not nearly as great as Emmy Lou's ""Red Dirt Girl"", but well worth owning and listening to whenever you need hear a 'no-nonsense' appoach to relationships!!"
3,Good; not great,"She has a couple of excellent tracks on this CD. I especially like ""Are You Alright"", but the overall work seems uninspired. I find it a bit of a downer, in the main (and, yes, I understand the inspiration.) I recognize her artistry as a songwriter, but her voice on this CD -- after a while, its nasal quality begins to grate; she doesn't do that as well as Tracy Chapman."
4,not as good as CWOAGR but still terrific,"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road is my favorite CD, but WEST is becoming a close second. I especially love Fancy Funeral."
3,West goes south,A friend of mine thought I'd like Lucinda Williams work and so while purchasing some other folk rock I think Amazon linked me to this cd. Familiar with her name because my friend said I should give Lucinda a listen I purchased this. I also purchased another recommended artist this friend thought I might enjoy. Cat Powers.Well I guess if you enjoy listening to painful depressive lyrics which are arranged with music that is slow and heavy that reflect this mood than this ablum is for you. The depths of depression is the last place I would like to be. I had it on my ZUNE for about 3 weeks before I couldn't listen to it anymore so I deleted it.Cat powers is similar in genre.I guess maybe I should try earlier works of both of these artists.
4,Four Stars....Barely,"Half a dozen cuts are top-notch Lucinda -- the title track, Learning How to Live, Rescue, Where is My Love, and my two personal faves, Are You Alright? and Everything Has Changed, which was all she needed to write about the failed relationship. The rest, because it is after all Lucinda, ranges from OK to good, but what we've come to expect from her is new or unique perspectives on universal realities like death and cheating. Instead, what we get in West is unremarkable venting at being dumped (including casting aspersions on the ex-partner's prowess) and, in deep personal grief, the half-century old insight (hello, Jessica Mitford) that funerals are a waste of money. In short, on too much of West, the songwriting is a significant cut below Lucinda Williams's own towering standards."
2,boring,"I love Lucinda, but this sounds like her attempt at rap or late-period melody-free Springsteen-type songs. The reviewer who said they all begin to sound alike is right on. And that 9-minute song is absolutely the dullest. I look forward to Williams' next."
2,Lucinda Williams-back to your roots,"Lucinda Williams, the finest songwriter of the century, needs to return to the great songs she wrote in the beginning of her career. The only song on West that I really liked was ""West"". I will continue to buy all her albums anyway, I think she is great!"
4,More Great Songs from Lucinda,"The first thing you have to understand is that this is NOT ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road."" This is Lucinda digging deep, living on the dark side a little bit. This is, obviously, a transition record for her in terms of her life and her craft. With collaborators like Bill Frisell and Gary Louris (The Jayhawks) adding their considerable talents to this offering, this is a very intimate CD. Although I like ""Car Wheels"" better, these songs include some of the most dramatic music and lyrics that Lucinda has ever produced. My personal favorites are ""Are You Alright?"",""Where is My Love?"", ""Everything Has Changed"", ""Learning How to Love"", and ""Unsuffer Me."" The arrangements are very understated and the CD has a very mellow, laid back feel to it. This is a great Sunday Morning CD. Fans of Americana Music, as well as Lucinda's Fans, will enjoy this release."
5,From The Heart,"Let's start by saying that by today's standards, there are very few singer songwriters better than Lucinda Williams. It's almost unfair to compare it to her other work, because the bar has been set so high. With that said this one is still very good, although I would disagree with anyone that would call this her best yet. A previous reviewier stated that if you like ""Essense"" then you'll like this, and I have to agree with him. But ""Essense"" is still hard to top.All and all, I do think that when we look back at the end of the year, and measure this C.D. with every other record put out by various artist, this one will still rank as one of the best of 2007. Great stuff as always by one of the best!"
4,lots of gems on this one,"Many critics were disappointed with this album. They should try listening to it more than once. By the third listen it really got under my skin. Some of Lucinda's best songs sneak up on you and I prefer that to being hit over the head with a radio-ready tune that you quickly grow tired of. This seems like an album that Lucinda Williams made for herself. If so, then I like it even more. Too many artists make music that will please the critics and the public, losing a sense of experimentation and a sense of themselves in the process. Regardless of the songwriting (which I think is top-notch in a very sly way on this album), Lucinda is one of the best vocalists around. She could sing ""one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish"" and make it sound captivating."
1,"Maybe She Should Come Back ""South""","My main dislike is with the pace and rhythm of this disc. That is, there are none! It's one funeral dirge after another. Secondly, there seems little to no melody present. The songs are recited rather than sung because there's just no tune there (I'm aware the demo vocal parts were used). Third, whereas Lucinda's music was once infused with country, blues, and a most-definite ""Southern"" sound, this disc sounds stripped of any personality whatsoever. Finally, what is it with these songs where she repeats the title 122 times? And, yet another rap? Major disappointment this one is."
1,Forget this one,"I'm a big fan of Lucinda Williams, and have several other cd's of hers, including Car Wheels On a Gravel Road and World Without Tears, but I regret getting this one, and won't listen to it again.The lyrics are repetitive and simplistic, the melodies have a boring sameness about them, and it's far from her best work.Let's hope for better next time. She's shown she's capable of it."
4,A genius even when not at her best,"Lucinda is a great, great talent and even when she's not at her best she's still heads and shoulders above the fray. WEST gets a little bogged down in places, a little stuck but it still touches, engages and at times amazes. Lucinda is like no other. We always see her soul."
1,"The new age ""epistemology"" and ...","...This book should be titled ""Alice in the land of misinformation"" ... or .. ""Tao of Sentimental Physics""Just another bad science book for artisans and paisans ..."
2,It could have been way much better.,"I bought the first Now Dvd when it came out in 2003 and found it ok so I bought this one and honestly, just have few good videos.I think that the best videos are: No Doubt ""IT'S MY LIFE"", Good Charlote ""HOLD ON"", Christina Millian ""DIP IT LOW"", Black Eyed Peas ""HEY MAMA"", Chingy with Ludacris & Snoop Dogg ""HOLIDAE IN"", Jessica Simpson ""WITH YOU"" and Norah Jones ""SUNRISE"". The rest are just to fill the Dvd. And about calling this the best video collection of the year, that's so funny. Where are great videos as Kelis ""Milkshake"", Enrique Iglesias ""NOT IN LOVE"" or Maroon 5 ""SHE WILL BE LOVED"", just to name a few.I hope that Now can release a good one this year."
1,Synching is off,"I like the songs on this compilation HOWEVER, the audio and video is off about 1/2 second or 1 second depending on the song AND this is the second one I got (I exchanged the first one since audio and video was not in synch). For $15, its not worth the two trips I have had to make to buy this. I contacted the manufacturer and they told me to go back to the store. How many will I have to exchange before I get one that is in synch???"
3,Lip Synching Appears to Be Off,"I bought this DVD to find that the singers' mouth movements in every video on the disc do not match the lyrics I am listening to. The synching is off, about a half second or so. I returned the DVD for another one, and the same thing happened with the second one. Has this happened to anyone else?"
3,so much promised,"I first found this sim on these pages, after reading the reviews I decided to purchase the program and eagerly awaited its arrival. It's been downhill eversince. I could not get the targeting to work and the toggle views were not fast enough for me to catch a glimpse of say an Me 262. I have tried a number of times to get activision to tell me what I needed to make this work , I own a new computer and I have enough memory and speed,it has been one month since I started to contact activision and their response so far is to download a driver that I already have. Now they suggest a new voodoo 3 but dont specify which voodoo 3 series. I am truly disapointed in the program and am sorry I purchased it."
1,Not Good,"Don't waste your money on this game. European airwar is by far a more realistic game. The cockpits are not accurate and the is game is hard to play. The prop is way to small and looks stupid. The terrain looks good, but the gunnary looks stupid. This is one of the worste flight sims I have seen."
1,Not worth the $,"I was very disappointed when I received these shoes. They were not the same shoes that are in the picture. I could see all the glue that was used to hold them together. The soles were frayed all around the rubber. Simply put, these shoes are cheap and not well built. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THEM!! I sent them back for a refund the next day."
3,Probably not worth it for most people,"I bought these shoes for costume purposes, which means they didn't need to be anything fancy.The construction appears kind of cheap. Also, when they arrived, I noticed the laces on one were significantly shorter than on the other, so one doesn't wrap around twice as shown in the picture. On the plus side, they're sturdier than they look, as they stood up to a lot of abuse from me, including running around in the woods.All in all, they got the job done, but they aren't the most attractive."
1,save your money,To think that a tree gave its life for this book is very depressing. Contents are so general as to be absolutely useless.
5,Fun time with my daughter,"Great video to dance around with your little ones. It also expose the kids to new instrumented, rythms and sounds."
3,Weird but interesting,"This was a weird one for McCone, but the mystery was fully developed and as usual the author didn't give much away until the very end.It is not necessary to have read the other books in the series to understand this one, but the others are pretty good too."
2,Pennies on Eyes not the strongest,"After getting into Marcia Muller a few months ago I picked up Pennies, thinking it would be equally enjoyable. I was wrong, barely getting through half the book and then putting it away. Don't make this one a priority, it's slow and it's hard to care about this case or the people involved."
5,Good series for young teens,Both of my daughters 10 & 14 love anime. It is a complex world to find anime that is both tame enough from adult anime and yet not so simplstic that you could categorize it with Barney. I was lucky enough to find this series among others for my daughters. It has a great Magical girl feel and while there is a hint of romance it; is not so in-depth that I need to restrict my 10 yr old from watching.
4,Please note this is the SECOND Season!,"I reported this to Amazon 3 weeks ago and got a response that they would update the product information. This product description and picture is for Lyrical Nanoha A...yes the 'A' is a different season. Season 2. I almost bought this thinking is was the full season one (and not the Viridian edition which usually may have less goodies such as no inserts, etc.) Still a good series."
3,1st female Canadian Idol delivers solid debut,"Yes this was a largely pre-formed album, ready-made for whoever won the 2005 Canadian Idol competition, but doggoned if it doesn't work. As a guitar-driven pop album it certainly makes mincemeat out of the Hilarys, Lindsays, Simpsonettes, etc., and while some of the songs sound similiar to each other, none of it is embarrassing, a MAJOR statement regarding Idol albums, most of which are utter stinkers of the worst order. The production doesn't launch into overkill, the arrangements make sense, and most importantly, THE GIRL HAS SERIOUS PIPES! A pure natural vocalist with a lot ahead of her. There are at least three big singles on here, and the albums will only get better from here. A producer like John Shanks could put her through the roof, but this is a very promising start."
4,"Hard to Find, Glad I Did","I mostly bought this for the song: ""Speechless,"" which is a really lovely, but girly song. She has a strong voice, but the music remains mostly popish and not something I'd probably listen to daily.Still, an excellent CD with a decent booklet inside."
3,Disappointed,"I saw this movie a couple of days ago with high expectation. I read few reviews and the most reviews said that the movie was great. Especially, I expected many good sword fighting scenes. There are many fighting scenes but the quality of the scenes are very disappointing level. The main charactor seems that he doen't know any sword fighting and martial arts. He was just an actor, not a sword martial artist. People just died if the guy used the sword in any ways. That's not a martial art scene. However, there was a great scene. Only one scene. When Toshiro Mifune fought with some guys, he showed the great action with his sword. Toshiro Mifune was not a main charactor in this movie. The main charactor was just an idiot. I think even I can beat him easily. Don't be cheated from other reviews. In terms of action, this movie is a stupid. But if you like a some deep story and feeling behind the scene, you might like it, but don't expect any good fighting scenes."
2,Good movie goes bad,"It starts well enough, and undeniably has some good action, but the disjointed plot, which at times seems all over the place leaves you a little confused. The ending is a real let down and what little plot you can fathom seems to come to nothing.Avoid."
2,The Sword of Doom - Ho Hum at Best,"I should have paid more attention to Erick Husher ""The Serat""'s review and left this one sitting on the shelf. All of the the excellent reviews lulled me to a false sense of security and I foolishly wasted my money and my time. What other's consider artistic and stylisic I considered boring and uncomprehensible.Even the opening scene where the much reviled Tsukue Rynosuke, rogue ronin, kills an old man on pilgrimmage with his granddaughter was misrepresented in the reviews. For pete's sake, the ronin overheard and answered the old man's prayer, he didn't wantonly kill the old guy. Think of it as Kevorkian ronin.Some of the swordplay was good and the black and white photography was all right but the movie never really works. This ronin was supposed to be evil and without conscience yet ends up driven insane by the ghosts of those he has murdered. I am of the opinion that you either have a conscience or you don't. It can't be both ways."
2,Sword of Boredom,"The fights are weak. The story is confusing. If you are amazed by the subtle footwork of warring swordsmen, then this is your film. If you are looking for the Lone Wolf and Cub-type of film, RUN AWAY!!!! The ending is no where near the payoff it should be for having to sit through brooding Japanese subtext of emotional conflict. The protagonist has the potential to be one of the best on film but his stone face lulls me into submission. No wonder he wins all of his fights: he stuns his opponents with tedium. 2 stars are for the ending. If you are an art-house goon, you'll drool over this drab dribble."
2,Stupid Main Chracter,"This movie is horible. Why? becuase of the stupid main charactor. The guy is a horrible fighter that doesn't know how to use the sword properly. The director should concern high level of movie watchers. The director might cheat some viewers, but not some sword experts like myself. In my point of view as a sword expert, the main chracter is horrible. He ruined the whole movie. I think a reviewer well pointed out how the main character could not fit properly in this samurai movie. Horrible main character."
3,Confusing!,"Great action, excellent acting and a superbly shot film, which sadly falls down when it comes to the story. The plot jumps around, in some places makes little sense, and the ending is a great let down. It almost seems as if at times, chunks have been cut out the plot. For example, both the main protagonists agree to duel at dawn, next thing time has moved on, there is no mention of whether the duel took place, and if not why not. There are better films of this type to buy."
2,"good film, bad DVD, no bonus material","This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""The Sword of Doom"" known in Japan as ""Dai-bosatsu tge"" is a depiction of a samurai swordsman who is inherently evil and kills an opponent during a fencing match. The dead man's family pursues the killer.The film is very good and has some great scenes but the DVD has no special features at all except for the essay in the liner notes which I don't think count.This is the first Criterion DVD without special features for a long time and think it was a mistake for them to release a film without special features."
2,Read what I have to say before buying this movie.,"I saw this movie a few years ago. I loved it till the end when there was a cliffhanger ending.I was really angry with the ending but I did a little research and I found out that this movie was part 1 of a trillogy. The other 2 films were never made!So I can only give this a partial recommendation. With a movie this great, its a shame the others were not made..."
3,Really dramatic..,"This film is good and won't be taking anything away from it's directing, visuals or acting. On a personal note I guess the story was not as enjoyable as I would have liked it to be.. but it stands out as quite memorable. There is no victory in the end for anyone.. this was probably the point of this film and the direction for the filmmakers. It's like a story of an athelete or some non hero who goes down a path of drugs and what not.. and ends up dying in the end. Still glad to have this film, yet wasn't expecting this type of storyline. It's kind of depressing. There is no story arc more like a story downhill. Sure there is some glimmers of some story weaving, but ends up at a dead end. The only climatic and saving grace of this film is the exquisite fighting slashing scenes."
1,utter dribble,"I can sum this movie up in one word ""CRAP""Worst Samurai film I have ever seen. If you like Kurasawa stick with him. This ones worth avoiding."
4,Japanese movie not intended for American audience,"""Sword of Doom"" is magnificent in its visuals, and fully realized in its characters. As a few have said, the story is somewhat inscrutable to the average American viewer who is not familiar with it. The movie is still well worth watching for its incredibly evocative cinematography and the presence, however abbreviated, of Toshiro Mifune. As to the charges of Nakadai's skill (or lack thereof) with the sword, I'm not sure that our ""viewer from California"" qualifies as an expert on kendo. Nakadai used simple steps and dou strikes to great effect, and the swordplay was no different than in the majority of samurai movies available to Americans."
5,One of the Greatest Samuari Films,"I am a huge fan of the Japanese Samurai film, and this film is one of the main reasons. If you are a fan of Kurosawa films, you should check this out. If you like Spegetti Westerns ala Sergio Leone, then you should pick up a Kurosawa film, and this one. If you like the Wild Bunch, you might like this film too.The main charater has a dark foreboding feel of a samurai ""Darth Vader"". Though, in Star Wars, it turned out Vader had good barried within him. This charater is just bad. To me he will be one of the quintessential evil charaters of all time.That said, the plot is excelent, the acting is great, and the directing is top knotch. The director is capable of creating the same tension as a Leone shoot out, and the same sinse of carnage of the shootouts in the Wild Bunch, except with swords. That is why to me Samurai films are supperior to Hong Kong Kung Fu movies, they were directed to create mood were the Kung Fu movies are only about action."
3,Great but.........,"The maps are very detailed and they contain a plethora of POI's (Points of Interest). On very important point though any buyer should be aware of.You can't download the maps contained on this Micro SD card to your Mapsource Software, which pretty much makes the Mapsource software useless.I contacted Garmin and the very friendly customer service rep. said that the Micro SD cards maps can't be downloaded off the card on to your PC. She recommended (as I would) that if you want to be able to view the maps on your PC and use the PC to map routes, edit waypoints etc. buy the DVD's not the Micro SD. They are the same price.Bottom-line. If you want to just pop the card in your GPS device and use it then this item is probably the way to go. If you want to do more, especially with your PC, then get the DVD instead. I wish I had known this before I ordered non returnable software."
4,Very Good Maps,"Using this product probably could not be more simple, all you really have to do is plug it in. After doing so I was finding Geocaches faster than before and was confident to travel places unknown afore. Not only does this card unlock new details on top of the basemap but many more features I had no idea my Garmin Colorado could do. Bought it from Amazon because they are trusted and only a few bucks off the best price I found on the net. If you have a Colorado I highly recommend this product. I didn't give 5 stars because the maps certainly are not flawless but come close I suppose. My one negative; and this is being very selective shall we say, is because a couple days ago coming back from a hike I called up the nearest gas station and the map was 0.15 mile off."
4,the City Navigater N. America NT 2011 Data Card from Kenwood?,Is this the same as the City Navigater N. America NT 2011 Data Card from Kenwood?Trying to update DNX 6160
3,North American Maps,Arrived on time and easy to use. I already have City Navigator for the Garmin 60cx and it has a lot more streets than this one has for the Garmin Oregon.
2,garmin,There are better ways to get this map. I would not buy it. This map is just not worth the $60 dollars or so I think I paid for it. Like I said I think Garmin has been eating too much big dog cat food. They have gotten too fat off there customers. The very customers who paid for the GPS R&D.
1,Be careful,I'm sure this item performs admirably. BUT BE CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING. Amazon's website can be misleading if you don't read carefully. I accidentally ordered the item in the wrong format...one incompatible with my GPS unit. Amazon's website implied that it was compatible; my fault...I didn't read carefully enough! I was unsuccessful trying to get satisfaction from the vendor so I am out $84; a bitter pill for retired fella to swallow. I have yet to try Amazon's Money Back Guarantee..........but I will try it and I hope to recoup some of my loss.
4,Great Addition To My Orgegon...,"I had gotten the topo map as a download but wanted the streets on my Oregon for Geocaching. I decided on the SD card. I really wasn't sure if I would lose the topo data with the streets...but I did not. I put in the card, turned on my GPS and it worked. Streets on top of the topo data. Now I only use my TomTom for long trips in the car. I use my Oregon for everything else. I never even pull out the other GPS for Geocaching. Could not be easier to install and use. My only fault with it is minor. There does not appear to be a simple way to upgrade the data...but I don't need hyper-accurate maps. If you are a geocacher...you can't beat having the actual roads on your Oregon."
5,Met him on pogo & great book,I was talking to him. His book is the best every one should read jonh's book. It's like titanic only more mystery and I like it alot. jonh love you! see you on pogo karine
4,A Great Resource!!,"Diane Connell's ""Brain-Based Strategies To Reach Every Learner"" is a great resource for teachers AND parents!As a primary school teacher for 20 years, and now currently working as a consultant in schools with parents,students and teachers on how to switch students on to learn in a way that makes sense to them, I can highly recommend this book. Crammed full of really useful information - and presented in a style that makes sense - you don't have to be a teacher to understand the message that we all learn in different ways... and that learning can be fun!For teachers there are so many great tips and ideas which can be easily implemented in the classroom and for parents who want to find out what makes their child 'tick', this book is a real revelation. A top read - well done Diane!"
5,It's Jazz... Baby,I got this for my granddaughter in hopes that I would be able to give her some hope of appreciating good music before she became a teen. But after listening to the CD I found that I really enjoyed it. Perhaps they aren't the most thought provoking lyrics but it is a nice compilation of songs from some wonderful artists.
5,Great tips for novices and advanced pro-sumers alike,This video gives straight forward and useful information on shooting digital photography in various sports settings. I found it very useful.
4,So-So,"She is Me was a fairly quick read for me. I could picture the story as it went along. The storyline was very familiar, as I'veseen similar details occur personally. I know how the story goesso it did nothing for me.Greta is the mother of two grown adults, the wife of a doctor and the daughter of a cancer stricken woman,Lotte. Her responsibility is to care for cancer stricken Lotte. When Greta gets cancer herself, things get rough and others try to offer support. As death draws nearer, a self discovery occurs. The familytries to go on with everyday life and somehow they mange it.This was my first book by Cathleen Schine. I'll have to read her others and see if they're any better. Having read the book I ended up giving it a rating of 4."
4,Great book,"This is an very useful book for all teachers, especially the harried and belittled inner city public schoolteachers here in the Bronx."
2,Some aspects of teaching missing,I thought advice on some important topics was missing from this book.
4,UNDERGROUND HIP-HOP,"THIS ALBUM IS A GOOD CD. THE SONG ""MAKE THE MUSIC WITH YOUR MOUTH BIZ""THAT SONG SHOULD BEEN ON THE ON THE BET 50 DOPEST MCs and it should have been #4 this album is an classic."
5,One of my favorite artists at her best,"Patsy Cline has always been one of my favorite country artists. Her story had a tragic ending, but her clear, strong voice lives on in this recording. I play it in the car and in the house. Beautiful."
3,What a voice.,"I just love listening to this old style of music. Patsy Cline has such a pure tone to her voice. I have to remind myself that even though some of these subjects are a little degrading to women it was a different era and it's the lady's voice that I love. I experienced some volume fading and getting louder in few of the songs. But, that's my only complaint."
1,"FLAWED DVD-PATSY CLINE, THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION",DVD does not play correctly. On tracks/songs 13-15 the DVD does not play the song. I have to skip these songs in order for the DVD to play! NOT WORTH THE PRICE!
2,Patsy Cline - The Definitive Collection,"The CD has a lot of songs my husband and I are unfamiliar with. Those songs were o.k., but not great. The songs we are familiar with are great songs."
2,A little disappointed.,Pasty Cline is Patsy Cline no matter what but I was a little disappointed in the first few songs as they seemed to be earlier recordings that didn't have the quality of her later recordings or the recordings of those songs that we normally hear.
4,Patsy Cline - The Definitive Collection,The first cd that was sent had a worble sound thoughout it. When I contacted Amazon about the problem it was promptly picked up and sent another one. This one played wonderfully. I am listening to it now.This is the first time that I have ordered anything from Amazon and have to say that I am impressed by the service.
3,Patsy Cline-The Definitve Collection,"Liked song selection, but audio quality is lacking. Sounds flat, and I played it on good CD Player! Would not recommend!"
3,Not one of my favourite People books,"I have been reading my way through the People series, and this is the 5 in the series and the 5 that I've read. Of all of them so far this one was my least favourite. I have found the others in the series to be so believable and engrossing. This one was less believable and the characterization was not as finely drawn. I intend to read the rest and I hope that they are more like the other 4 books in the series. So far my favourite has been People of the Earth."
3,Entertaining,"In essence this is the story of a young wife who escapes her homicidal husband after suffering domestic violence and turning to another man because of loneliness. Her lover is killed and she flees, pursued. Running parallel with this (and gradually intermeshing) is the tale of a spiritual leader struggling to understand the changes taking place in his world. Now put this story back a few thousand years into just post-glacial America and a whole new dimension opens up.My only problem with the Gears is that they always start with a scientific stance (the evidence of archeological digs and research) yet introduce fantasy elements such as real contact with spirits, witchcraft, possession etc that contradict the physical. One has to be patient with this unfortunate anomaly because the stories are often quite entertaining but they would work just as well with a bit of harsh reality."
3,"Excited at first, just good at the end.","I was very excited to find this book in hardback. I have the whole series and hadn't been able to find a hardback copy to read and put on my shelf with all the other ""People"". It seemed it was missing something that some of the other books have, it was still good, and still had lots of information, but I didn't seem to get into the book as quickly as others. Still I would recommend it!"
3,probly the weakest story of the series,I really liked the saperate storys of the 2 main characters a lot better than the combined story of the 2. I liked the story of kestral a lot she is pragnet by a another man and is running from her husband and she has to survive by her self.
2,"I tried to like it, but I couldn't :(","The size is wonderful, the pictures are very cute and the colors are somewhat appealing, but as hard as I tried liking this deck I just never could connect with it. Perhaps the drawing style is what irks me..the people all look ""old"" and dwarfy also the colors are a bit washed out. I think it's cute, but the drawing style is simply horrible to me -- can't connect with this deck..."
1,It's missing cards!!,"I really liked this deck but noticed it's missing three cards!!!, the 3 of cups, the 9 and 10 of pentacles, I felt really disappointed, specially because since it was an international order it would be more expensive to me to send it back than the price of the deck.Be sure to review your deck, not recommended for orders outside the US."
2,Offset cards are not good; I want new cards or my money back,"There is a white border around the entire card that is totally offset...take a look at the cards and you will see what I mean. I have never had this problem before, but I don't want offset cards. I'm paying good money for these cards, and they are not good quality at all. I want new cards or my money back, but I can't use these in my business. I work as a professional psychic/tarot card reader and Astrologer. I want top quality tools when I work with the public.Sincerely,Whitney"
5,Still the best deck,"I love tarot decks for the art. And this, despite the hundreds I have seen, is still my favorite. Also good for the tarot-a-phobic who have no real understanding of tarot and think it is something bad."
4,"Approachable, but a little bit cutesy","This is probably one of my favorite Rider-Waite-Smith type decks. However, it's a little bit too cute at times, with the round-faced, red-cheeked people smiling in so many of the cards. I use it quite a bit for readings for people who aren't familiar with tarot, because it's approachable and friendly-looking, but it has a tendency to sugarcoat the serious stuff. It's great for teaching someone to read tarot, because it's so unassuming, but to read for myself, I almost never use it."
3,good for the price,"Loved it. thought it was going to be bigger, but it turned out smaller than i thought. all in all it was a good product. loved the pictures too."
1,An ode to middle age,"I was not as impressed with this book as I have been with his earlier works. Examining his bibliography on a time-line, with the exception of ""Skinny Legs And All"" (and I'd bet money he'd written it or at least had a good outline somewhat before its published date), everything from Jitterbug Perfume to the most recent excrescence seems to be the masturbatory fantasy of an increasingly bizarre and pitiable personality attempting to hold on to some vestige of youth in the typical way of dirty old men chasing after sweet young girls, only he does it on the page rather than (or perhaps in addition to) real life.This novel, this very one, is the mark of when Tom Robbins jumped the shark. (I typeoed 'humped' and almost left it that way, as it seems rather fitting.) I'm disappointed. Robbins' earlier works are like opening your mind with a rusty can opener. His later ones are just embarassing to read. Preachy, not very interesting, and just plain silly."
1,Poetic Gobblety Gook,"Reading is this is like sludging through a swimming pool full of good chocolate. It is all very good, but there is too much of it, and it has no plot. IT is just a bunch of poetic meanderings that would be good as short stories but not all squashed together as a huge book. It also jumps around from paris to Seattle, to New Orleans and anciend what i think is rome or greece or england or ireland. IT jumps so much that it leaves you the reader in the dust. But obviously some people liked it or else it would not get an average customer rating of five stars. So i suggest you read it and decide for yourself."
4,Masterpiece by a writer like none other,"I've loved every Tom Robbins book I've read to date, with this one probably being my favorite. He is easily one of the most original writers of all time. There is no mistaking the many bizarre twists and turns of his plots for the writing of anyone else, and his inventiveness is matched by his skill at wordplay. There are many talented writers on the literary scene but Robbin's signature style makes him stand apart from the rest in the best of ways."
5,Long Live Tom Robbins!,"Yes, as you may have read in other reviews, this one is about longevity. It has great insight and philosophy regarding the evolution of the human brain and its flowering potential. Wow! Uh, without going on too much about the plot, consider the fact that although TR is known to challenge our inherited conventional perceptions, he just might be the Rare Existential Optimist. Jitterbug Perfume is simply another novel that makes you laugh out loud, stir-up those colorful dreams and lighten-up!Erleichida!Karmasoda"
5,My therapist recommended this book years ago.,"In the midst of a therapy session, my therapist said, ""I'm not sure why I'm telling you this, but something is telling me to tell you to get this book Jitterbug Perfume by Tom Robbins.""I did. It snapped me out of my funk. It has been my favorite gift to give over the years. It's one of the few books I've ever read more than once. I re-read it every couple of years. It's Robbins at his very best! You know that question, ""If you could have 10 people for an imaginary dinner party, who in all the world living or dead, would you invite?"" Well because of this book I'd invite him.Those he wrote after Jitterbug Perfume we're severely disappointing...reminded me of Phil Collins in the '80's...putting out albums because he could, not because they were good. But, I find myself forgiving Robbins for the ones he wrote after....when I think of this 'work of art'."
3,Typical Tom,"Let me come right out and say this: If you like Tom Robbins, you will probably like Jitterbug Perfume. If you have read his stuff, and not enjoyed it, or have finished any of his books and said ""eh"" than this is not for you. It rambles, the characters are all half mad, and halfway through you being to wonder who exactly the book is about.It is typical Tom Robbins, although Jitterbug Perfume falls apart at the end. It is almost as if Mr. Robbins had too much philosophy for not enough pages- it was fascinating, but at the same time, I wondered if his ruminations on life, religion, etc, couldn't have been put in a different essay, rather than put the plot on hold for a fair while while we all sort it out.It is an interesting book, funny, though provoking, like I said, typical Robbins. But it not is strongest work, wandering around a little too much, enough for the story to lose a bit of cohesiveness."
5,Why Can't All Books Be This Good?,"The only large novel I've read more than twice. I shall read it again some day. Not for the narrow-minded or mirthless, but an epic delight for the rest of us. All the 5-star ratings on this page say more than I could possibly put in words. Buy it, read it, tell your friends."
4,Must Read,"Robbins is a pleasureable, thought-provoking, and uplifting break from all the muck and maw out there in real time!A reader must hang with him on his wild ride of writing and creativity, or the book will not be enjoyed."
4,Good read,"Love Tom Robbins' books. I'm not a literary scholar, but the way Robbins deals in both the metaphysical realm and relates it to his character development makes for great reading. However, these books aren't for the faint of heart when it comes to sexual situations, just fair warning."
3,Good in patches,"I have heard a lot of Tom Robbins from many of my friends. So, I picked this book. Maybe because I had too high expectations, but I was disappointed with him. His style was interesting. The theme, though was good in content, but could've been handled better. One of the many signs of a bad book is the visibility of arrogance and vanity of the writer. And I felt that in this book. I don't want to judge Tom Robbins as a writer by reading just one book. I am sure, if he had so many fans, he must be having ""some"" talent. I picked his other book - Skinny legs and all. I will form an opinion about him then. But this book sure disappointed me though it was good in patches."
5,Tom Robbins Best,"This is without a doubt Tom Robbins' best book. It's more coherent and linear than his usual fair. A fun and engaging story that is surprisingly difficult to put down. Having read this several times, I am completely amazed that after each reading I discover things I missed during my previous readings. And each time I come to the end, I am sad that I have to leave these characters. This is one of my favorite books because it always leaves me excited about the world and my life."
2,Toys in the attic,"I read TR's books and they changed my life-when I was 13. I thought that what TR said about the soul being light as a feather was so very deep. Not the second time around. Really, let's be serious. I think you have to have an IQ of about 70 in order for that to happen.He has the same cutesy prose as Dennis Fariña, who only got published because he knew the right people. TR writes about sex like a creepy, impotent old man. You know, like Robert Heinlein.At least Heinlein's female characters have talents other than (....). AND his stories are cool. I'll take A Confederacy of Dunces or any of Lynda Barry's books any day. And I like Dave Barry too, as far as dorky older white dudes are concerned.I still like beets though."
1,More words than a dictionary,"I'm not even going to get into the story. Suffice it to say it bounes back between 3 different cities and 3 sets of characters. I've been struggling to finish this book. It has now become my mission to finish it, as painful as it may be. What could be described in a few sentences goes on for pages and pages and pages. Any wittiness is lost in the blah blah blah of the endles WORDS. Cut to the chase man and get this slow as molasses story going! I don't care about the story. I don't care about the people. I don't even care how it ends. I just want to finish and be done with it."
5,indescribable,"I find Jitterbug Perfume to be life affirming. It chronicles the journey of the mind, body, and soul. It encourages those to follow their beliefs, adhere to their dreams, to take chances, and dance with the gods. It shows us that life is never ending and yet it gives a long hard look at our mortality. With humor,sensuality, wit, introspection, and pure wonderment, this is something that you read and remember and share with others"
4,Great book with a terrible ending,"I really loved this book. It has everything you would want in a great novel: complex characters, great dialogue, a compelling plot. The the ending leaves you with a ""huh"" sort of feeling. It doesn't really wrap the book up in a nice little package with a neat bow like most books do, which you could see as wonderfully different or terrible. I found it just odd. I didn't leave you with that little sigh of relief you get when you finish a book, or the bit of satisfaction that comes with finishing something. That was probably something that Robbins intended, however I just didn't like it.However, the other 99% of the book is wonderful. I wish I could give it 4 3/4 stars."
3,Great First Half,"I am, and have long been, a big TR fan, and I loved the first half of this novel, it was as thought provoking as anything he has written. However, just as MY Attention was peaking, I though Tom lost interest. The last third or so of the novel was not of the same quality. My impression was of an author looking for some way - any way - to wrap things up."
4,jitter bugaboo,"I borrowed this book from a friend and was constantly teetering on outrage and howling with laughter throughout. Some of the things he says, can be just downright sexist, but it's so absurd you have to laugh. The story line is pagan to the core and I can see it being quite offensive to some. But I was delighted with Mr. Robbins word play and the unique way he managed to make beets the central aspect of a story. His immortal characters are much more engaging than the present day seekers of a certain scent, but given it's flaws, this book is a witty and provocative read."
5,Challenged by Immortallity,"Simply one of the Finest books I've ever read !! ""What makes Love last?"" One of Life's Eternal questions! We need to find an answer that will work for a 40 or 50 year period. Difficult enough!! The protagonists that Tom Robins has create in this book seek to answer the same questions. Their problem is a bit Larger, Having discovered the Secret to Immortallity, they must find out ""what makes Love Last"", Forever!!!Great Story!Amazing Characters!!Excellent Lessons, to be Learned and Sahred!!!Buy it!Read it!Blessed are those who Live out their Dreams..."
3,"Charming, but somebody stop him.","First off, someone kill Tom Robbins before he butchers literary style again. A creative writing intructor once told me ""You can only break the rules of writing if you do it properly."" I always imagine Robbins as the kid in the back of the class muttering ""I'm gonna break all your stinkin' rules, bud!"" This book, he sticks it to the concept of metaphor, and none too subtle. But for a nonfan, I enjoyed this book. Robbins is still an excellent story-spinner, and hits on immortality with a bawdy hammer. On that, I still recommend this book. Be wary of hs styles though (people who write in second person should be forced to read choose your own adventures in hell)."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An amusing book. Seems to also explain why American sugar/sweetening tastes worse in coke, etc., the use of beets instead of proper sugar cane!Anyway, lots of silliness and erotic cravings for sensual indulgence, some shagging and a bit of running around by the god Pan. Not too bad."
5,Pure inspiration.,"This is one of my all-time favorites, a book that I return to regularly when I need that healthy dose of perspective. Robbins' takes the reader of a journey through the past couple of thousand years and, with insight and humor, uncovers such weighty dilemmas as religion and the quest for immortality. Everytime I read this book I fall more in love with the characters Alobar and Kudra and see something that I missed on a previous reading. While it always saddens me to put the book down upon completion, I always look to my journey in life with much more magic, inspiration, and beauty. Indigo, indigoing, indigone..."
5,"Jitterbug Perfume, Tom Robbins, Love, Life & Everything else","This was the first novel i read of T.R., since then i have read the rest of his collection and remain a faithful and dedicated fan. Combining eastern thought, love, metaphysics, and religion you have to hand it to the author of this wonder in modern literature.... Robbins has done it again unlike anyone else can, and left me in amazement with what one can create with language and creativity. I strongly recommend this to anyone who has been touched by the stick of creativity and imagination."
5,Tom Robbins is a Genius,"I love and own all of Tom Robbins books. Jitterbug Perfume is by far my favorite. It is a wild and creative ride that only could come from Tom Robbins imagination. If you don't like metaphors or poetically written books then don't read Tom Robbins, you just won't get it."
5,A great holiday read!,"This book moves through time from the ancient to the modern, and follows the story of an ancient couple that has learned how to live as long as they choose.When I first started reading it, I was questioning if it really was my kind of book. I'm glad I stuck with it! Robbins has this incredible writing style that combines well written prose with clever similes and metaphors. Just like David Letterman, he will be writing something serious and out of the blue he'll throw in something that adds a decidedly comedic mood. So it's not an easy read, but extremely enjoyable.On of the most refreshing things about the book is the way that Robbins will be writing about ancient times, and driving his points home with modern and humorous images. He was ""shaking like the shuttle in an overachiever's loom"" or ""The Middle Ages hangs over history's belt like a beer belly."" I don't know if everybody would appreciate this kind of writing, but I loved it. I'd recommend this book to anybody."
4,Subway Gold,"I am a newcomer to the world of Tom Robbins. I always heard of him but I really didn't know what his style was like. One day on my way home from work there was a guy reading this book on the subway. He kept laughing to himself as he read this book, so i had no choice but to read it myself to see what all the fuss was about. I must say there were many more elements of fantasy than i figured, but what a story! Who comes up with this stuff? It's somewhere between a forth grade fairy tale and a Vonnegut masterpiece. A definite recommendation to any fans of the surreal and the fantastic. 4 1/2 Stars."
5,Highly recommended & not just for women,"I've been scanning the customer reviews and a lot of them seem to be by women. That plus the fact that the author is a woman and the book's title and heroine are Breakup *Girl* might lead you to believe this is a book aimed at, and only for, women. Not true! I'm a guy and found this book witty, insightful, and relevant. Go out and get yourself a copy!"
2,Poor Pretty Eddie DVD,"The problem with this DVD film is that it is not remastered. It is simply a VHS-quality film that is transferred to the DVD format.This really annoyed me, as I wasted my money. I should have bought this from an official seller such as Virgin or other movie store.Not only that, but something suffered in the transfer, and as a result, when you pause a scene it is even blurrier than it was originally on VHS!"
4,Wolf Rider,This book was really good in the beggining but the ending was not that good. This book is about a 15 year old kid named Andy who got a call from a crazy guy who claims to have just killed someone. I had trouble putting it down. This is definetely one of Avi's best book's yet.
4,"An interesting, mysterious book!","Don't you like an intense book? Who wouldn't, especially a life or death situation? Andy, the main character in this story, received a strange call on a Friday night about a murder. It is up to Andy because nobody believes him, not even his dad. Nina Klemmer might not be the only victim. So watch out, Andy, you might be next! --Monica Perez, Manuel Jimenez and Jocelyn Rosales in Ms. Marik's 6th grade class"
2,Mediocre Read--Good for boys,"I felt that this book let me down. The beginning few pages were very intriguing and interesting; however, it took forever to come to a climax and actually accomplish anything. The plot repeated itself several times and few things were resolved. This book does leave a lot of room for re-writing endings for coursework or dramatization of parts. Boys would enjoy this because of the gory details and mysterious repetition."
4,Wolf Rider,"Andy Zadinski was having his friend Paul stay at his house for the night, then it happened. Andy got a mysterious call from a man who called himself Zeke. Zeke had killed someone. Andy spends the next month and a half trying to figure out who this ""Zeke"" exactly is. He discovers who it is, but now he must convince everyone that he is not lying about all of this Zeke business. No one believes him, not even his own father. He also must warn those who Zeke is planning to kill next, but he can't get within twenty feet of the people without starting a commotion. Now he must expose Zeke as the criminal he is."
4,"Not the best by Avi, but almost","It is by far one of my favorite books, but not Avi's best, but that is hard to compete to. This book is very addicting, a great thriller. Extremely hard to put down. It's about this young kid named Andy, he just moved in with his dad after his mother died. He got a phone call from this guy named Zeke one night. Zeke said he just killed someone. Nobody belives Andy, and he has no proof. But he is bound and determined to prove it is true, looking all over for help, and trying to find his own proof. It's not the most realistic book, but still is a book that keeps you on the end of chair, and on your tips of your toes. The cover or title didn't catch my eye. I wasn't going to read it until one day my reading teacher read a section to it to me. I continued it on my own, and I am glad. Must read great book. I highly recommend it to you."
2,Wolf Rider,"I thought Wolf Rider was a fair book, but not a great book. It starts out fast and exiting with Andy Zandinski receiving a phone call saying,"" I just killed someone.""After that it becomes a repetitive story of Andy trying to get people to believe the call was real but no one thinks it was. Some people might like this book, but it wasn't exactly an engaging book. I would recommend this book to all those young die hard mystery readers, but anyone else can just toss it to the side."
1,The beginning was good,"It started out good and then got dull and became a book that sucked. we did not get the excitement we needed,and we did not get the point. Andy seemed like a confused character that needed a lot more work. The next time Avi writes a book he should put more thought into his character."
4,Wolf Rider,"One day a fifteen year old boy named Andy Zadinski got a suspicious phone call from a stranger. The stranger told Andy that he just killed a girl named Nina Klemmer. Andy told the police right away, the police treated the report as a joke. After trying the police Andy turned to his father. Andy's father told him that it was just a prank call and to forget about it. After a couple days Andy saw Nina just as the stranger described her over the phone. Andy tries to warn her about the man that wants to kill her, but she takes his warning as assault. After hearing the police's response he decides to take matters into his own hands. This book is great for ages 12-15 years of age, because of the dramatic storyline and characters."
4,Resolution left something to be desired,"If I'm going to read a murder mystery, I want the ending to tie up the loose ends that you discovered throughout the story. The author does a nice job of making the main character look and act like he is going crazy, but it might have been more believeable if ONE person would have believed him besides the ""bad guy."" It was too black and white: either A) I believe you and want to kill you, or B) you're a jerk, stop talking about it, and you need professional help. The ending left me wanting MORE than what was given. I do not feel Andy, the main character, and his father ever reached an understanding for as long as the dad didn't believe him. The idea that they didn't talk about the ""bad guy's"" demise bothers me. The image of Andy going away on a plane, and his father weeping over a cuff link... what was that about? Who was the father crying for? The bad guy or his son?"
3,Wolf Rider,"This is a great story with and interesting plot. It's about boy named Andy. One day while in the comforts of his home, he recieves a mysterious phone call from a stranger saying, ""I just killed Nina"". Andy is shocked and surprised by this twisted message, but manages to gather enought information to try to track killer down. I thought it was clever of him to try to lure the caller into giving him extra information. He also called the police and told his father about the call, but they didn't belive this call was real and blew it off as a joke. However, Andy had that gut feeling. He knew that that person was out there, and he would find this mysterious ""murderer"". I felt that this novel was very suspenceful and kept me turning the pages. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who likes a suspenceful adventure with a little bit of danger twisted into the plot. So, if you looking for a good page-turner read Wolf Rider by Avi."
3,Wolf Rider by Avi,"Fifteen-year-old Andy just moved to a new house and a guy claming to be Zeeke says that he just killed someone. That hits Andy like a bucket of bolts. He takes the whole thing seriously, and nobody belives what he is saying. Not even the police think that it was a real call! The chain of eventa is kinda slow until the last couple of chapters. Personaly, I think that this could have happened to a real person. I also think that this book could use a little more ""zip"". This book seams to be of the horror and nonfiction-yet-still-fiction type of book. I would recomend this book to people that read on grade levels between 4 and 7, no more and no less. Also for those people that like a horror story without the gory details. I liked this book to a 3-star degree because it actually made it seem like you were watching a movie, but you select what the person looks like and where he is."
2,Lifeless Dialogue,"I wanted to really like this, but the dialogue drives me crazy.it was lackluster at best. The idea for the plot is okay, but we never really learn all the answers about ""Zeke"" and his motive."
4,good read,My daughter had to read this book over the Summer vacation for school and she finished it within three days. She said it was a good read
5,wolf rider,Best book ever because i really like Mysteries. like this one what i would have wonted to know is why is the book called Wolf Rider? was the peson who called already killed someone?but reading this book answerd all my questions. i frist wonted to read this book when my 5th grade class was reading it in small groups i wasent in the reading group but when everybody told my about it that when i really wonted to read it. after i red it i thought it was the best book ever so everyone should read it even me iam not a reder but i really liked this book so everyone give it a try and reed it. :)
5,Wolf Rider,"The book Wolf Rider by Avi is a very interesting mystery book. There is some violence, but it is still very good. The main character is a boy named Andy who cares about everybody.When he gets a call from a murderer, he tries to find out if what they said was true. Andy doesn't get any help from anyone because nobody believes him. If you want to know if he finds out the truth, read this book and find out."
5,Wolf Rider: A book of mystery,"Wolf Rider by Avi is a fictional book about a boy, named Andy who gets a strange phone call. When he answers the phone. Andy says,""hello."" The person on the other line says,""I just killed someone."" Andy didn't know what to do so he tries to figure out all the information he can about the caller. When Andy gets off the phone he calls the police. he describes the strange phone call. Andy and the police start a dangerous mission to find the killer. I liked Wolf Rider because it was suspenseful. At the beginning of the book the kitchen phone rang three times before Andy picked it up. ""Hello?"" he said. A voice replied,""I just killed someone."" This excites you and keeps you reading."
5,Highly Reccomended,I think that most of this book is real.It sounds right about the mother dying and real feelings about it.It is a real good book but ther is one downside.Who would react after someone calling and saying I just killed someone on the phone. Would'nt you hang up?Ask your self that question. Would you take that seriously?Then from that it was a very inspiring book.I think that about the parents treating him the way they did was realistic and all.When he went to the police and then he called the school and when he had no record of prank-calls then why would he call the school counsler?I highly recommend this book. It is good.The best and most realistic part is when the parents and friends act.So get this book.
5,Fascinating,"I wouldn't call this history; more like memoir. I also agree with one point from some of the other less complimentary reviews that Webb's narrative does not hold any punches with regard to her opinion/feelings about Mormonism. She was bitter and it does come through (to say the least). If she were around today and had taken a memoir class or two, she'd have been able to wrestle that bitterness out of the narrative for improved readability (it just gets a little thick from time to time and hard to wade through). But IMHO, the bitterness does not at all make her story less credible. I forgive the loaded negative opinion. Through experience, she earned the right to express it. She's like a war vet turned war protestor. Her truth may represent uncomfortable emphasis... the worst of it. But it's certainly believable. A fascinating, unsanitized, raw personal account from a controversial time and place in American history... delivered by an unexpected *female* narrator."
1,NOT very believable,"I read about 1/3 of it and lost interest. I was especially interested in Ann's book since she was in a position to offer an intimate insight into the life of Brigham Young, which is when most of the policy of polygamy was formed. I praise Ann for her courage in escaping the only life in which she was raised and had known and deciding on her own beliefs. She was obviously very traumatized by the whole ordeal. Every sentence spews a bitter hatred not only for polygamy but for the whole religion and supporters. I don't believe her account of events is very accurate. It varies too much from other accounts I've read and the overwhelming bitterness makes me think she was too affected to give an accurate account."
3,Thoughts on this work,"I just want to make clarifications on some of the reviews I have read here. First off, Anna Young was not Brigham's 19th wife. A brief look at his family history will clarify this. Furthermore, most Historians agree that Young's autobiography lacks significant substance when it comes to her accusations against both Brigham Young and the Mormon Church. Her writing style is at best entertaining, reflective of similar accounts of frustration with Mormonism. See T.H. Stenhouse's ""Female Life Among The Mormons"" as an example published in 1872. More critical accounts of polygamy and the like can be found. Consider reading Van Wagner's ""Mormon Polygamy"" or Hardy's ""Solemn Covenant."""
3,Mormonism the truth revealed,"The book gives a detailed look into the Mormon lifestyle. The young lady who wrote the book was raised by parents who joined Joseph Smith at the begining of the church.She writes very well and you can see the abuse the people who joined (never paid for work). Especially the women ( handed off to men to marry without their consent).People who became disilusioned after Brigham Young became head of the church were usually found dead. Brigham was a man who only thought about what the church would bring him, in money, luxuries, aduration.This young lady was brave enough to leave the church and helped by Christians from the area.I started to read this to get an understanding of Mr Romney, I can see him in Brigham Young. Mitt Romney's father on the other hand was a very loving and giving man"
4,wife no. 19: insight into how tough life could be for some in the 1800's,Gives a sense of life as a mormon in the 1800's. I am about half way thru this long book. It's interesting enough to get one past the slow read aspect/ repetitious points without further specific evidence. The illustrations are of very poor quality.
4,Eye opening,"A great book. An eye opening, first hand account of the beginning of Mormonism. This book is also amazingly well written and easy to read, considering the age it was written in."
4,THE VERY BEST OF GLENN JONES,"It is no secret that Glenn Jones is one the best male vocalists in the music industry. I so wished he was still recording, but this CD includes all of his best songs and 2 or 3 of his hits. There still could have been other songs included, but it is a very good CD to listen to if you like the 80s and 90s music. I could actually listen to that strong baritone voice all day. Glenn is very gifted and talented when it comes to singing. I am still waiting and hoping that he releases a new CD soon."
4,Ole school at is best,"If you dont know Glenn Jones' voice, treat yourself. He was a staple in ole school R&B. Angelic voice, much like Peabo Bryson."
5,Mellow,i have always loved his voice and when i heard the song show me i had to buy it because it was my favorite love song. he has a really beautiful voice.
5,Clarity on trade injustice,"Sen. Brown has given an unblinking look at the way rich countries abuse poor countries. This is the only book-length treatment of this injustice I've seen. He deals with the causes of the poverty in the poor countries, and how to deal with them.Treating the symptoms by sending handouts to support our agriculture iindustry is scandalous.Karl Hess"
1,Pandering to the Left-Wing!,"I honestly read this book with an open mind but found that Brown makes many mistakes usual for someone without an education in economics or another applicable business area. If you are someone with a background in economics, skip this book. It will not make much sense unless you are a socialist, communist, or have fallen for the usual ""jobs shipped over seas"" myth."
5,Heroic tragedy,"A classic heroic tragedy. Mifune's character is a samurai who has devoted his life to service and the samurai code. After admitting to himself that his lifelong devotion has left him unsatisfied, he observes the love of his son for his young wife and is deeply moved. He ultimately finds that he must uphold the redemptive value of love (whether of a man for his wife, a father for a son, or a friend for a friend), even against overwhelming odds. The samurai's defense of the meaning of life that he has found culminates with three of the most spectacular and dramatic action sequences I have ever seen in a film."
3,Samurai Rebellion,I'm a Toshiro Mifune fan but this was not worth buying or even the time it took to watch it. Way too simplistic a storytelling. The Seven Samurai was Wa-a-ay better.
3,Not my cup of green tea.,"I understand why it's an artsy movie but I thought it dragged on and in the end the fight was ok. This is not the Seven Samurai nor 13 Assassins. Collect if that's your thing, but you'll be fast forwarding it some."
1,Not as advertised,Did not contain the CD recording as advertised. The recording of poetry by their authors was half the reason I ordered it. I returned it.
3,Discovering Leila,"i found tracks by leila on a couple of compilation cds and liked them a lot, including the first track on this cd, Coisas da Brazil, which i love.the rest of the album is not dissappointing, although it takes a couple of tracks to get going. the accompaniments are a little less than organic, a little manufactured, but the singing is great and the songs are good."
2,The Misinterpretation of Bob Dylan,"Bob Spitz manages to waste this thoroughly researched and at times enlightening document of Bob Dylan by practicing a single-minded interpretation of content with the determination one uses to keep a preconceieved idea of a subject in line from beginning to end without sacrificing preconceptions for truths that arise between. Spitz wanted a unique portrait of Dylan and he did what shaping was necessary to achieve it. The book does provide real insight into Dylan's childhood, except for the strange ommision of anything related to writing from the would-be poet."
1,Spare us.,Mixed metaphors make a mess of this. I am in the publishing business and only hope this writer goes back to his job in the music business as he has no business writing.
4,"Great music, video quality and mostly the same for sound","If you are an Aventura fan is a must, if not but like to collect good bluray concerts this could be part of your collection.Content: includes the most important hits of the group ( just have on sight that this concert was before The Last album, so don't expect Dile al amor to be included). There are a lot of feats very enjoyable, and Romeo on stage makes this performance a very entertaining oneTechnical: video very crispy at full screen the whole time giving a sense of inmertion very enjoyable. Audio good, althought lacks of stage space, so good music sound, not great home theater experience.In summary, a very good aquisition by the content itself at a very good price!"
1,fail,don't purchase item from this person i never receive my bluray movie i hate it 1 to 10 i rate you guys a 0. :-{.
5,Love it,"I watch this all the time and sing to the songs, I get really excited when watching this. Would highly recommend it."
4,Desert Solitaire,Abbey's writing is stellar! His excellant use of similies and metaphores make his worka page turner! I perchased two paperback copies to share with friends.
3,Not the Italian Movie,"Hamoun was a disappointment for me, partly because it had been overpraised with comparisons to Fellini's 8. Both movies indeed make use of dream or fantasy sequences and both deal with a middle aged man's intellectual and marital confusions. But for the sake of future viewers, let's be clear: Hamoun is not in the same league as 8. Mehrjui can't match Fellini's wit and brilliant visual style, and his film lacks the same coherence. Allusions to famous directors, and references to Kierkegaard, Daoism and Robert Pirsig's motorcycle book don't supply profundity to the exercise.I'm not saying it's an awful movie. It probably works better in Farsi, but the English subtitles of my DVD are unidiomatic and ungrammatical (I mean, at any rate, the words that are visible)."
2,Wack and weird,"This movie was crazy. Just when your starting to make sense of the movie something strange and unusual happens.And whatever you do dont eat while watching this.The writer of this film was obviously trying to make this movie different and exotic.Yet it just turned out basically all weird.If you like movies that are strange and collide with the usual this movie is for you.Finally,The subtitles are sometimes hard to see and are ungrammatical,yet you can mostly tell what the charcters are saying."
5,RARE OAKLAND FUNK,"Man this was the sh#$ BACK IN THE DAYS, THIS ALBUM IS BECOMING VERY HARD TO FIND. THAT HARD OAKLAND FUNK."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!,"SAVE YOUR MONEYAfter just a couple of years the water pressure turned to a trickle. For whatever reason we suffered through it for another couple of years before finally calling two different plumbers. They both concluded the problem was in he main housing which they couldn't fix. Called Franke, and guess what, they said I could buy a new one from them at a discounted price... Umm, no thanks."
2,lacking quality,"My daughter is obsessed with the Berenstain Bears, so we thought she would love these dolls, and she does! I think they are a little bit funny looking, but she loves them. We got these for Christmas and at just about 2 weeks after Christmas we have already had to repair papa bear in two places. His hat came unattached from his head and his button on his overalls came off. These are some of the only berenstain bear dolls available and aren't that expensive, but they aren't that great of quality. Hopefully they will last a while, even if we have to make repairs."
4,Great birthday present.,"My 3 year old daughter loves the Bear books and so my wife and I thought this would be a great birthday present for her. She loves them and picks a different one to sleep with at night. I will say as much as my daughter loves this product, they are (or seem) cheaply made). Papa's hat is hanging on top of his head by just a few threads and if my daughter was a little rougher on her toys that hat would be gone. Also brother bear and sister really don't look like brother and sister from the books, more of homely looking creatures that some what if not really look like like a bear. However my daughter loves them and she is happy."
4,Stuffed Bears,"Ordered these hard to find bears for my niece's 2nd birthday. They came super fast and were adorable. She loved them. The little boy bear's eye was sewn on a bit funny, but would definitely recommend!"
4,Loved them,I bought these for my daughters 4th birthday and they were her fav gift. She takes them every place we go and sleep with her every night!!
5,"Knife, Kyocera",This knife is the best knife I have ever used. It is very sharp. The handle is designed to decrease fatique. I received one as a gift and purchased this knife for my daughter. She loves it.
3,cool technology but eh as a knife,"if you don't, can't or won't sharpen your own knives and you're looking for something that will stay somewhat sharp for a very long time this is a great knife . but when you're used to the edge that a series of wet stones can produce on a good steel blade it's somewhat disappointing . i tried to sharpen it using a diamond stone with barely any results , so don't bother."
3,Paperback is poor quality,"I received a great shock my first semester of college when I had to buy books. The price of the paperback version was great. It was the cheapest college textbook I've ever purchased. However, after using reading the Chapter 2, the pages started coming loose around page 20. Pages 5 through 10 actually fell out of the book. I've had to use super glue just to keep the book together. Cheap was a good thing, but the quality is incredibly poor. I would rather pay a little more for a book that actually stays together.John Shand really seems to like to listen to himself talk. I'm usually more confused after reading it than before. It's pretty good for an intro book, but it can confuse people. Fortunately, I have a philosophy professor who is pretty good at explaining things in terms that we understand."
3,A gift for a 9-year old grandson,"Our grandson is enjoying the doll and trying to talk without mouth movement. The doll's mouth doesn't move easily with the string, however. Probably the much higher priced doll is a better buy if one is serious about learning ventriloquism."
3,"good scholarship, marginal subject","I was very torn as to how to review this book, because while I appreciate the fact that someone wants to document obscure parts of our heritage, the story simply isnt that interesting. If you are just getting into zen, I would get Kataghiris You Have to Say Something, instead."
5,"Mesilla Valley recipes : recipes from Mexico, Spain, and the desert",This is a fantastic book of authentic Mexican cooking and ingrediants. The only real recipe book of proper flavors and tastes. If you can find a copy get it.
4,really cool,great watch. excellent device. i only wish it worked with my tv. but that's just my tv. still a great trick and gadget to have!
4,"Good, but...","Having been a fan of the might PK, and patiently hoping that they'd get back together for the 6 or so years they were on hiatus, I couldn't wait for this album. I can break a review for this album in to 2 lines: The good and the bad.The Bad: This CD pales in comparison to either of their older works. They seem to have lost the R&Bish;/soul/jazz/etc. edge they had on the last album, and they've gone to a CD that's much closer to a straight pop album.The Good: It's better than 90% of the pop albums released these days, and it proves that they've still got talent, even if I still think they've misplaced their musical priorities a bit.Buy the album if you like pop, or if you're a PK fan, it'll be worth it. Otherwise, I'd wait and hope they give it another try and go to something a little closer to their older material."
5,Good Game I thought,"I thought it was a terrific game, who cares about the violence and/or language, if anything, it's realistic, how could you be so naive to think that this doesn't go on around the world, I think we needed a game this realistic, there's a reason that they put the ratings on games, to warn you, why buy it and complain about what it warned you about!!"
3,Kingpin really isn't king...,"Kingpin...where should I start? The main highpoint of this game is the impressive and funny songs by Cypress Hill that were made exclusively for this game. Aside from all the profanity and blood and gore, this game is ok but not one of the best games from Interplay. This game is basically your Quake mod that has a story and some additional features added to it. However it is funny to see the reactions of people in the game when you pull a gun on them. If you are up for lines and lines of profanity, tons of blood and gore and missions that require you bounce heads with some big boys, then this game is for you! The only drawback is the long load times so make sure your computer chair is comfy."
4,"Kingpin, one of my favorites","This is a great first person shooter, one of the classics. Although it's obviously dated in terms of graphics and performance, its still fun to play. Some of the objects are tough to find. It took a long time to get the battery for the motorcycle. Once you get into the game, it moves right along. It does get tedious waitng for the next segment to come up as you enter a long hallway or door, but you can tolerate it. Its a very satisfying game to play when you are in a bad mood at the end of a tough day."
3,Misleading but fun,"I bought this game under the impression that it was something of a gangster simulator. Call me dense, but that's what I thought. (Well, don't.) The packaging reads along the lines of 'Hire your own gang and tell them what to do.' It also mentions shooting informants in the kneecap to punish them. This is made up out of whole cloth, because nowhere does this occur. I was expecting to start off low then move into my own office, hiring new members, conducting gang wars, somewhat like Gangsters 2 but in 3D. This isn't the case. The blurb on the box gives the impression that you have far more control over your environment than you do."
3,Review by Professional Baker,"I was a little disappointed with the presentation of the recipes. They appear to be written for use by a large-scale bakery, i.e. for the production of ""dozens"" of loaves, making it difficult to produce a small number of baked items. Armed with a calculator, one has to reduce each recipe many times in order to do that.And there are sometimes directions left out as well. Definitely NOT a book for the amateur baker! The photos appear to be taken in the 1960's, and pictures of final products are not very appetising."
1,Doesn't work in my DVD player,"""The Dresser"" Do not understand this. This movie does not play in mt DVD player. I put it in and a ""loading"" message come up then ""wrong Disc"". This is the only DVD I have that does not work. I previously bought a used copy of the same movie that had the same result so I thought it was defective. Now I don't know what to think. The movie will play on my computer. It is a mystery to me."
4,Intense and well acted,"I bought this as a gift for two actors, one for which I was a dresser and thought it was a clever idea. I also bought one for myself, because I love Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay.They do not disappoint, although the story line is much more intense then I realized. The acting is superb and the costumes and settings are wonderful. But do not watch this if you are looking for a comedic, feel-good movie.I would suggest this purchase for those that love art films, great acting, and films about life in the theatre. The actors loved the gift."
5,Two Great Contemporaries Appear Together,"It is almost painful to watch the discomfiture of tyrranical actor Albert Finney (b. 1936) in his 247th stage performance of King Lear. Once a great bombastic actor, the poor fellow, in his dotage, can't remember his lines and must rely on his beloved assistant, called ""The Dresser,"" brilliantly played by the excitable, meticulous Tom Courtenay (b. 1936).The film is a psychological delight, with each part played to pefection and with the exquisite cruelty of Finney as he imitates in real life the unhinged Lear treating his utterly loyal cast and in particular his poor Dresser, whose only job is to please his boss, with shallow disdain and contempt.The end is a testament to the love and devotion of a single-minded servant and his ill-appreciated - although deeply fulfilling - reverence for his master. This is what I'd call an ""art film"" for thinking people who are not afraid to see heroes unhinged by destiny and the ravages of life. A truly great film!"
4,Worth having in your library,"I've never bought a concert on DVD before. It's a decent DVD, interesting method of recording and I always love their music."
1,RIPPED OFF,"I am VERY disappointed in Amazon. I have been using them for some time but this outrages me! This DVD is $9.99 at Newbury Comics!!!BUT Amazon was selling it new for $200.00 and used for $99.99.I thought because of the pricing that it was a rare DVD or had something special to it and I purchaed it for my fiance for Christmas since he loves the White Stripes. The concert is very bad quality and I could not understand why it was priced so high or what was special about it.You can imagine how disappointed, duped and outraged I felt that this very same DVD is only $9.99 at Newbury Comics. It is in BAD taste and is stealing from your customers to allow this to be sold for $200.00.I am not happy. And frankly, I want my $100.00 back or I wont be shopping at Amazon every again. And whoever sold me this piece of junk, you are a thief."
3,Great show from weak musicians.,"I agree with all the people praising the raw energy and emotion of this show. The performance of ""Jolene"" (a great song from Dolly Parton which shows country doesn't always suck) is manic.However, let's not get carried away with calling Jack a great guitar player or Meg a great drummer. Having taught guitar (and played in Jazz/Funk bands) for 35 years Jack White is a terrible guitar player technically. It works for The White Stripes and gives them a raw edge but it's not musicianship. When you miss as many notes as Jack does, and you can count them by the dozens on this DVD, then it may be energetic/raw but it isn't good. Similarly, Meg doesn't as much drum as tap occasionally, Meg wont be confused with Gene Krupa or Neil Peart anytime soon.Great music from poor musicians."
4,Definitely shows us losers what we missed out on,"The performance was supercharged, wild, psychotic and amazing at the same time. Jack is very drunk (at least i think) and he is commiting a murder of his guitar in front a lot of people. I wish I could've at least stood outside for this one, two people can make a whole lot of noise in one setting. I only gave this 4 stars because I wish they could've at least finished one song, just one and I would've gave it a 5. This is definitely something you should buy if you love them, but not if you're just getting into them, you may not be at the time in your muscial life when you can appreciate it for what it really is. If you like this then you'll probably like the concert DVD the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have out. Thier also a garage band and they make some wild music. BuY This! I got it on Ebay for 24 dollars."
5,Right there !,"I was lucky enough to be present that night, freezing cold winds and snow whilst queuing for several hours outside and the atmosphere was incredible being in a darkened ballroom ! The performance was electric and the crowd had fun bouncing on the great sprung ballroom floor!Yet to recieve the DVD but if it is 1% of the performance on the night then EVERYONE should own it!Looking out for myself at the front of the crowd can't wait !"
4,Rock and Roll Lives!!!,"Imagine the lyrical brilliance and melodic sensibilities of Lennon/McCarthy, the molten riffs of Jimmy Page and Tony Iomi, the soul and passion of Robert Johnson, and the force and energy of the Ramones, all in one band. The White Stipes is all this and more. They're quite simply the best ""real"" rock and roll band performing today. In a world of prepackaged, computer generated garbage that gets past off as ""music"", the White Stripes are proudly carrying the torch.The chemistry between Jack and Meg is amazing. I've never seen a band this much in synch since Led Zeppelin with John Bohnam. They literally can finish each other's sentences (musically speaking).If you've only heard the White Stripes on radio or CD, then get this DVD. The true measure of a band is whether or not they can cut it live. The White Stripes could easily wipe the floor with any other live act performing today."
5,great concert,"this is a great concert from the white stripes. The grainy footage doesnt bother me at all....its just an effect that shows the white stripes, the set list is great, but even though they are missing were going to be friends, fell in love with a girl, and a few others, i can live without them for some other great songs"
5,Rock + Roll = White Stripes,"I watched this DVD and I fell in love with rock 'n roll again, and maybe with Meg as well."
4,List of Matches,"12/14/92 Razor Ramon vs. The Big Bossman1992 Owen Hart, Koko B. Ware, & Tatanka vs. Ted DiBiase, Irwin R.

2,Disapointing animation,"I would be weary of purchasing any videos from the ""Great Bible Stories"" series before renting them to preview the quality of the animation. They do accurately portray the stories from the Bible, but sometimes it is hard to overlook the poor animation quality in this series. I would suggest ""The Greatest Adventure Stories From the Bible"" series as a possible alterative for better animation and a more entertaining presentation of the same stories."
3,Story about budding actress in the 1940-1950's,"This is an easy read about a college-age girl named Miranda and her aspirations to make a career on stage in the 1940-1950's. The majority of the action centers around the Shakespeare Festival that she is acting in, and follows her, her friends (and enemies), and in particular, male friends (one of whom is directing the play)during a summer. It is quite innocent by today's standards. I felt the book was a bit shallow, although considerable energy is spent on describing the girl's deep angst she experiences as she moves toward stardom. There is passing mention of her family, but not much emphasis is put on them. Hard work and discipline are seen as good qualities, and necessary for excellence in the craft. If one was particularly interested in acting and the goings on of stage life in this time period, they might enjoy this story a bit more than I did. :)"
5,So entertaining! You must read!,"I followed my friend's recommendation about this book and the author. I had an open mind about this so I went for it.Can I say it in simple words?: I LOVED IT!It is so fun to read although it isn't comedy. You will find yourself losing the track of time because you couldn't keep your eyes off the book. The characters have a strong personality and you can't help but love them all. You think you know how it's going to end but then it surprises you.If you really want to love a lesbian book, start with this."
5,great,"This is my first Gerri Hill novel and I can't wait to read more. I couldn't put this book down. Took me two days to read it, thats how good it was. I can see this making a great movie as well."
4,Goooood!,"I've never read a ""lesbian thriller"" before, but man did I love this one! Oh Sam and Tori :O) what great characters. I loved the different twists and unexpected events. This book definitely had me at the edge of my seat."
5,My first harp book,"This was the book that got me started with the harmonica. It starts very easy, with just two chords, and it goes slowly to the blues. In the blues chapter you can find some solos, and some are more difficult. What I liked about this book was that it goes through the basics at a slow pace and with many examples. Also, the recording is very good. The channels are separated, one for the backup song and one for the harp."
4,"Ok, but needs a lot of maintenance.","We bought this shredder about two years ago and registered it with Fellowes immediately. We used it for about two months, but then it broke down. I called in to have it replaced under warranty and was sent another one (without having to send the bad one back). In fact Fellowes made a mistake and sent us 2 replacements, but we notified them of the mistake. We've used the replacement since then with only a few problems. The blades can become jammed with paper (which happens after about 25 sheets), so you have to make sure you unplug and clean it up. Also, you need to make sure you oil the blades every month to avoid problems. Can't complain too much though - it is still getting the job done."
3,VERY OVERRATED ALBUM,More like 2 1/2 stars..I know that everyone out in cali loves banks but he really CANT RAP..his beats are ok if you like that style..If you mostly like NY rap you wont like this album..this and spice 1 are very very overrated..their too short rip offs..Dont bother buying this album..
3,"Good story, but the art is only fair.","Good story. John Ney Rieber is to be congratulated for his script, but Peter Gross should either go back to art school or SLOW DOWN. One gets the impression that he either lacks skill or was in a hurry to meet his deadline. I wish to god Charles Vess, who is created with the cover art, had drawn the whole piece, because his work is really quite fine. As if to back me up, the introduction by Jane Yolen praises the storytelling but never once mentions the art work. For good reason."
2,It was just not the best book.,"Some people would love it, I'm sure, but me, well, it was alright. Don't get discouraged though! You should read it and see what you thnk of it!"
1,got it all,I loved this book so much I know have the whole series and am going arounf geting the diferents ones even if the cover is the only diference.
4,LIVE IN COPENHAGEN 1973,"This quartet session was recorded live at the Montmarte Jazzhus 7/73 a day or two before the classic encounter with Dexter Gordon. The sound is better here than on his previous Montmarte quartet live recording the year before. The tunes are all originals. Kenny Drew's Callin' was good enough to be recorded again with Dexter aboard. Where Is Love is a good ballad. A Ghetto Lullaby starts out slow then picks up, shades of Gone with the Wind. The rhythm section is led by pianist Kenny Drew."
3,"Works Ok, but Organza Pouches are Cheaper & Disposable","These lint traps work well enough. They catch the lint, to be sure, but they quickly look grodie and disgusting. And no, they are not very easy to clean, particularly when you're grossed out. The lint sticks in every crevice and you just can't get them clean. And leaving them in the sink is especially gross, since we use our kitchen sink to drain ourLG Washer/Dryer Combo. So in searching for a better alternative, we came up with the idea of using organza pouches instead. TheseOrganza Jewelry Pouches, 100pcwork like a charm, have their own tie-offs sewn right in, catch MORE lint than these real lint traps, and best of all -- they're so cheap, I just use them once or twice and then just toss 'em. Perfect! I got a pack of 100 which made them about 13 cents each. Waaaaaaay more economical than standard lint traps, which push $1 a piece, at the cheapest; often more. Just my 2 cents. Works great for us."
2,accident waiting to happen,You have to check the filter often or you can get an overflow can cause damage. The potential water damage outweigh the benefits for me.
1,doesn't work,"The holes on this filter are absolutely huge compared to the lint coming out of my washer and clogging the utility sink. A Nylon stocking with zip-tie works best, but needs to be changed at least once per month or else it gets too clogged and then gets pushed off. I tried a Nylon stocking inside of this, but it just made the water shoot everywhere."
2,Lint trap,The lint trap or filter was not what was described in the amazon write up. The traps were so large that putting on our washing machine hose would have been a problem.
2,Keep your eye on it,The ties included with this did not hold it in place. Eventually I got it to stay on and it did the job well and caught a bunch of lint until a few weeks later it fell off the hose and plugged up the drain in the washer drain tub and flooded the basement. So if you use this make sure you are standing by the washer when the water drains through it.
5,Ten Years Later and Topical,"Agree with the other reviewer whose comments where made over a decade ago. The book is a great read and hard to put down. Have had this book on my shelf for a lot of years and simply did not get around to it. In light of the NY Gov and Wash DC Madame scandals over the last few years, the topic of high price call girls and their high profile clients made the book seem like it was written recently rather than sixteen years ago."
1,NOT worth 1/4 of the price!,"I've owned this dryer for 18 months. It has needed two major, costly part repairs. Even worse, the venting mechanism within the dryer that leads out detaches every few months, spreading carbon monoxide in my condo! It's happened ever since I bought it. The venting attached to my wall is not coming undone - it is specifically the mechanism within the dryer that detaches!! HUGE SAFETY HAZARD and LG does not seem to care! They patch it up and it comes undone again within months, spreading gas, setting off my CO detector and bringing in the Fire Department, etc. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS! It has a one year warranty for a reason!"
1,"Poor quality, needs repairs constantly, doesn't work.","I spent over $2,400 on this dryer and the washer, and they are both worthless. The dryer doesn't dry properly, has been down for repair twice for a total of 4 weeks to the tune of $550 in repairs. First the gas valve died (a ""common"" problem with this dryer according to the repair person) $300 repair. Now the drive belt broke, and that's another $250 with some other parts. They are both less than 2 1/2 years old.The washer vibrates so much it sounds like there's a military helicopter over the house. And yes, I've tried ALL the vibration fixes. Nothing works. The washer smells like mildew, even when you follow the instructions for cleaning and leaving the door open between cycles. And it LEAKS on the floor randomly.LG = Like GarbageI had a Maytag set for 18 years before this and they worked perfectly. I wish I still had them instead of these 2 year old junkpiles."
3,Great dryer when works,"After having this dryer for a year, the gas valve broke, the dryer would be working but no heat.But it's a great dryer when it works!We've fixed it already but it's just annoying to have the dryer break only after a year and it's not like it is being used excessively."
4,this is an extension to the first one in series,"with the intention to continue (the financial success of?) the first film on conductors this second one brings more conductors and conducting time and even less commentary. the rich written notes somewhat make up for the lack of commentary in the film itslef. yet, again, as is the case with the first film, it could be greatly improved by adequate analysis."
4,I Go To Work!!!!,"""I Go To Work"" and ""Wild Wild West"" make this CD worth getting on it's own. However, only at a price point that is under $10.00. Couldn't find this CD on iTunes in Canada, so this was a good pick up."
4,A.Wood you're sucker,"How can Moe Dee deserve only 1 star? How can an old school's true pioneer be garbage? This album is very good, original and Kool Moe Dee's style is elegant but also cutting. Featuring stunning tracks like How Ya Like Me Now and the LL-destroying Let's Go this album is an essetial old school document.God Made Me Funke, They Want Money, Do You Know What Time It Is?, I Go To Work and Wild Wild West are also very good tracks, the rest is a bit weaker. The only other thing you have to know is that A.Wood is a fake, he's a Busy Bee fan and since Moe Dee destroyed Busy Bee on a freestyle he rated this album and all the other moe dee's albums with one star. you don't believe me? check his reviews, he probabily doesn't even know what he's talkin about so don't consider his useless reviews. Instead listen to the album because Moe Dee is an original freestyle master.Peace"
1,"Bad album, bad flows over all this album sucks","This guys best music is still worse music,This guy doesn't even deserve to hace KRS-One on his album.I love classic rap but this guy is awful"
5,"It's true: this 19"" monitor takes up same deskspace as a 15""","I really couldn't believe this when I plopped this sucker on my desk. I used to have an old 17"" monitor in this spot, and with this new 19"" monitor I suddenly had 6 more inches of deskspace!ViewSonic is one of the best monitor vendors in the business -- they're always pushing the envelope, yet keeping their reputation as a manufacturer of reliable equipment. With this monitor, you can run (your video card permitting) at 1600x1200 at 78Hz, which means you get top notch resolution at a pretty good refresh rate (i.e. no flicker).About the only drawbacks I can find are that it doesn't come with a built-in USB hub like some of the newer models do, and that there is a slight curvature to the tube. It's plenty flat enough, unless you're one of those types that has to have the perfectly flat screen. My mother, my sister, and I all have one of these PS790's, and we have absolutely zero complaints!"
4,This monitor is pretty incredible....,"This is an excellent monitor, HOWEVER, there is a single dark pixel about 2/3 from the left about a half inch from the top of the monitor (usually can't be seen -- and just the luck of the draw). Also, the 1600x1200 mode is just too darn tiny, and adjusting Windows to larger fonts, etc. does not work well because of WINDOWS. It just doesn't scale well. 1280x1024 is beautiful and the short neck design is amazing. It sits the same distance from my face as my old 15"" montior and both were pushed all the way to the wall. Also consider the GS771 or the PS775 or even the E771."
1,Worst monitor I have ever had !,"I bought three Viewsonic monitors over the past three years(PS790, GS790-2, and E771), and man, what a huge mistake! They are all dead now while ten-year old Dell monitors are still kicking.Don't expect it to last long, if you buy one. I will never ever buy any Viewsonic brand in my life time !"
1,poor cd!,this is a very poor album overall although i havent even really listened to it this bubblegum rapper!
5,Funny and Interesting!,"My mom read us this book as part of our family reading night. We loved it and were extremely disappointed when she would stop each night. We liked the book so much that we named our dog ""Huppy"" after the puppy in the story!"
2,For Academics Only!,"When my friend was telling me about this book, she made it sound so interesting! I could hardly wait for her to return it to the library so I could check it out. Then I started reading it and it's not quite as compelling as my friend told it. It's overly ""stuffy"" and tells a technical, academic tale - not a compelling entertaining tale. Pretty much everybody in the book leaves the farm to go to grad school and get a PhD and/or eventually ends up being the ""consumerist"" they were trying not to be. Plus there's a lot of name-dropping in the book."
5,Details visionaries and their movements,"Many young Americans went back to nature in the 1970s - and just as many returned to build lives in the mainstream society they had rejected. Back from the Land : How Young Americans Went to Nature in the 1970s, and Why They Came Back details these visionaries and their movements, using the experiences of a woman who lived her subject and interviewed others in the process. From the early days living in a technological-free zone to returning to a mainstream community to forge new relationships and work, Back from the Land : How Young Americans Went to Nature in the 1970s, and Why They Came Back provides an excellent survey."
4,back from the land and happy about it,"I was one of the people who lived this type of life in the mountains...and although it certainly did give me a strength in character and greater empathy for others, I left it behind too. It was hard even if you had running water and electricity. Still, the experience does lodge in the memory and you are never really happy in the city or suburbs once you have lived on a large piece of quiet land. I highly recommend this book to anyone with that rural dream, or readers interested in women's history or that time in our country."
3,Worth reading,"Like an earlier reviewer stated, take it with a grain of salt. It is evident in this book that the author has a lot of nagative energy from her experiences attempting to homestead. It is well written, intersting and thought provoking. This book is worth reading if you would like a prespective of why homesteading did not work for many people."
4,Interesting,"Lots of anecdotes from a very wide variety of people about what it was like to live in the woods, with a particular focus on why it sucked. Most of the people interviewed were pretty straight; there is only one reference to drugs in the book, when a joint was passed around at a gathering. If you're more interested in the truly hippe/alternative lifestyle, try Huerfano: A Memoir of Life in the Counterculture OR Sleeping Where I Fall, etc... etc..."
5,Exactly what it says it is,"It does exactly what it says it will, and it didn't break after the first use (that's what the less expensive 3rd party adapter did)4-stars (instead of 5) because it was more expensive than I wanted to spend.2012-06-03: I still have and use this. It still works perfectly... Based on that, it was completely worth the price! I'm changing my rating from 4-stars to5-stars"
2,"Plodding, preachy ripoff of G Heyer's ""Arabella""","It is hard to believe that anyone familiar with historical romances could call this novel original. It is an almost exact imitation of the plot of ""Arabella"", one of Georgette Heyer's well-written, well-characterized novels. In that novel, Arabella achieves the conversion of the hero to goodness without rivers of tears and unbelieveable hours of prayer (as the soggy heroine of ""Before the Season Ends"" indulges in seemingly endlessly). I was annoyed by this book, and by its preachy premise. The laughable final surrender of the hero to God's Will through duelling with the country parson (who happened to be the most interesting character in this book)will leave you shaking your head over why you spent your time slogging through 400 pages of contrived, often depressing drivel."
3,A little preachy even for a devote Christian,"I am a very devote Christian and while I enjoyed the story, the preaching in the last third of the book was a bit overwhelming. I believe that we instruct people in faith by example and pushing religion at people as was done here, usually does not bring about the desired result. For this reason and the hero's own personality, the likelihood of the heroine achieving the result she sought by the means she used were totally unrealistic."
4,kept me entertained!,"This story was pretty well-written, and the author seems to have been strongly influenced by Austen's works as well as works such as Louisa May Alcott. A love story with a Christian undertone, the story shows the young heroine maturing almost inexplicably fast. She goes from mooning over an inappropriate middle aged suitor to capturing the attention of the most sought after bachelor ever! Still worth a read."
3,Decent romance with a religious sledgehammer for an ending,"As a non-religious reader, this is actually a good romance. The religion doesn't become overbearing til probably two thirds of the way through. Once the hero of the story decides to marry the girl, the story could have ended. However the author brings in the religion in so overbearingly heavy that it takes up another third of the book. So if you don't mind such heavy-handed religious propaganda, kudos to you. But if your like a non-religious reader like me, the first two thirds of the book is great. Just remember to stop after the hero proposes. ;)"
1,Author Scam on reviews,"After you finish ""Before the Season Ends"" you will find a bribe from the author Linore Rose Burkard stating that a free book will be offered to those who give the book a 4 or 5 star review on Amazon. This is blatant hypocrisy especially as the author writes as if she is truly a Christian, not a cheat.The book itself was interesting, I enjoy the Regency period & am a fan of Georgette Heyer who wrote much better Regency novels.Burkard lacks the sense of humor that influenced Heyer, although she did try to be amusing at times. The ending - a foregone conclusion - was way too long and drawn-out.I would probably have given a 3 star review if it hadn't been for the author's offer of a ""free book"" bribe."
3,My hope was set higher,"Resembling Georgette Heyer, more specifically Arabella!.... Sadly enough I was dissappointed. Certainly it was good enough to read but It did not turn out a keeper in my crowded bookshelf."
4,great first novel!!,"I was really surprised this was the author's first novel because I thought it was extremely well written. It is a great example of the regency style, and the Christian themes were tastefully woven into the story. Readers who like to read stories with faith as a distinct element will very much enjoy this, and those who just like to read a good regency will still get their money's worth!My only caveat (and the reason that it is 4 stars instead of 5) is that I felt that ultimately we weren't shown enough of how the hero changed his approach to faith at the very end. It felt a tiny bit forced and unrealistic, and I would have preferred to see a more gradual and realistic reformation. But overall the story is very well written!!The plot has already been well summarized by other reviewers, so I'll just say that if you like regency novels, you will definitely enjoy this one!! I am already looking forward to her next novel!"
5,An Inspiring and Lovely Book,"Before the Season Ends is a book that pulled me in and made the characters, story and scenery come alive. This historical novel is beautifully written and keeps readers engaged from beginning to end. I love that it is written purely in a historical style, not trying to incorporate modern social issues into it.Linore Rose Burkard is an outstanding author and I sincerely look forward to reading much more of her work!"
2,Started out well. Finished Badly,"I have nothing about Christian romances but this book is strictly for hard core fundamentalists. Having formerly been involved in that sphere of Christianity, I had no problems initially with this book and considered it a good read. However, about midway through the book it became tiresome and annoying. The heroine seems more suited to a life as a nun than as someone's wife, constantly praying over every... single... event in her life, so much so that I was skipping numerous pages at a time. Calling it preachy would be an understatement.To the author's credit, it is very well written and much more akin to Jane Austin books than today's romance novels. Societal decorum is followed to a much higher degree and it is squeaky clean in all aspects.If you are looking for a sermon, look no further but if you want a regency romance without a constant religious tome, keeping looking."
5,Authentic Regency Novel!!,"I loved this novel by Burkard!! Any Jane Austen fans will love it! It deals with religion a lot which I was not expecting, but had thoughtful insights to add to the novel and well developed characters! I recomend this to anyone who wants an accurate account and great Regency Romance novel!! Thanks for a Great enjoyable read Burkard!!"
4,Very enjoyable,I really enjoyed reading this book. In particular the first half of it. There were some corny parts but it mostly worked well. I think it would have worked better if he'd done the visit to her father before she'd agreed to the engagement.
2,The first half is interesting but the second is far too preachy,"Spoiler warningThe first half of the book is very interesting and goes at a reasonable pace. The Christian theme is subtle and adds quite nicely to the story. However, the second half is far too preachy for me and I lost all sympathy with the protagonist as a result. It was also so drawn out that by the end I didn't even care whether she got married or not.The ending was also too predictable and not very believable. Like another reviewer, I had the feeling that one person wrote the first half and another person wrote the second half.Personally, during the second half I began to doubt whether I would ever really want to associate with the protagonist as her sermons on religion (and general attitude) became very distasteful to me.But anyway, in terms of the actual mechanics of the book, the second half dragged on for too long and the ending was both not very credible and very predictable.I won't be reading the sequel."
1,Very Disappointing,"This book was a big disappointment. I purchased it for my Kindle after reading the great reviews. The main character seemed childish and I couldn't relate to her decisions, especially to her insistence upon marrying the rector who was her father's age. Philip Mornay seemed like a pathetic Mr. Darcy wannabe. He was misunderstood until he met Ariana and he tried to deny his growing attraction to her. I didn't like him and found it irritating how much emphasis he put on picking out Ariana's wardrobe. The entire book was extremely predictable and the few last-minute attempts at plot twists were over-dramatic."
2,Great Beginning/Boring Ending,"I don't really understand how this book has received so many 5 stars. This first half of the book I was really satisfied with; it was page turning--I couldn't wait for an other interaction between Ariana and Phillip and loved Aunt Bentley's little quirks; however, once you get about 70% into the book everything changes. It becomes about a quest for Mr. Moranay's salvation--so dire to Ariana, yet is not really pressed upon until this point in the novel. The first half of the book and the second half are arguably two different books."
5,full of purity and beuty!,"i red it in Russian,wasn,t able to leave it alone until finished with my busy sceduale in a few days,its like a magnet ,very touching,affeting romantic book for girls and older..."
3,Romance,very good romance couldn‘t stop once i startef. i would recommend this book to amy one that liles romance books..
5,"If you like Pride & Prejudice, you'll love this book!","Well, I must say that this genre is not my typical style of book. I usually stick to mysteries and fantasies. But, since I love the book Pride & Prejudice, I thought I would give this book a try. I'll admit that it was better than my expectations and I can't wait to get my hands on any books to follow. Following Ariana's struggles with Mr. Mornay was an absolute delight!"
3,"Knots,splices and fancy work vs knots & splices","I recently ordered the book ""Knots,splices and fancy work"" written by ""C.L.SPENCER"" having previously owned a copy i was looking forward to doing so again as it was an excellent referance work to a particualy unusual method for one 9""part"" turks head knot.Saddly what i ordered and what i recived (very promtly i acknowledge)were two diffrent things as my order arived i found NOT the proceeding but instead a book titled""Knots & splices"" written by ""P.W.Blandford"" in itself a respectable book and one i am happy enough to now own but redundant as a referance source and very definitly NOT AS ORDERED."
4,"A little long, but very good for it's time.","It's a documentary about the making of the Matrix, what can I say? I thought it was a little to much to take in one sitting, and the special features should be in the documentary. I thought it gave to much stuff away as to the future of The Matrix, but it really takes you into the life of the movie and is really, really in-depth and interesting to watch. I didn't like how one of the actors had a cigarette in his mouth, but no big deal. This isn't a sequel, this is a behind-the-scenes thing that should have been put on the official release. Go buy it, only if your a hardcore fan."
4,I'll Review the VHS,"I can be a technological dinosaur.The dvd was great, and a previous reviewer already went into the special features. No complaints here.The VHS...Overall, it was a great companion to the movie. It features interviews with Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, Yuen Wo Ping, Bill Pope, the Wachowskis, Joel Silver, Kym Barrett, Barrie Osborne, John Gaeta, etc.; artwork, storyboards, behind-the-scenes footage, etc. Though it misses the ease of navigation of the dvd, it stands alone quite well."
2,"It's a ""The Making of the Matrix"" DVD""","I originally thought that this DVD would include ""The Matrix"" movie and have additional commentary along with the scenes as an option. Actually this is what would normally be referred to as the second DVD in a collectors edition DVD set. This DVD should be labeled as ""THE MAKING OF THE MATRIX"" and in my opinion not worth what is being charged. If your a film buff or are just a Matrix Junky, then this is for you. If you are expecting more than a just another ""The Making Of"" DVD with a few ad's for the upcoming parts of the trilogy, then forget it. Save your money. It's worth a few bucks, but it's not worth the as much as would be normally charged for the movie itself."
3,WARNING! Does not contain the movie!!!,"I bought this DVD assuming that it contained the Matrix movie, along with a bunch of extras. WRONG! I'm a huge Matrix fan, so you can imagine my disappointment when I discovered I have to fork out another 20 bucks for the movie. So for anyone else making a buying decision on this DVD, take this under advisement!"
2,Huge disappointment. Lazy author.,"Maybe the author(s) aren't procrastinators, but they are lazy! I found this book to be worse than a waste of money. It was a waste of time, too.Take the time to develop some real material here worth publishing rather than just a rambling brain dump.There is little-to-no original thinking in this book.Maybe it is valuable to have common-knowledge anecdotes and heresy about procrastination repeated to you. if so, I'll save you the trouble with some examples:""I have heard of some companies restricting email use to just the last ten minutes of each hour. Try that out.""""I have a colleague who had two monitors. I asked why. He said that he 'can keep multiple applications open'. I have heard of productivity gains of as much as 50% from such methods. Try that out.""""The Now Habit"" is a (much) better book."
4,Insight into the problem of procrastination,"This book is a bit of a double edged sword. It's wonderful for its insight into the psychological aspects of procrastination, but it is often bogged down by those same explanations. The practical tips on overcoming procrastination are very helpful however.NOTE: This review was written by the author of ""Never Be Late Again, 7 Cures for the Punctually Challenged."""
4,Excellent book,"Judging it by its cover, this book looks excellent. I haven't got round to reading it yet though. Maybe next week."
2,Too much talk and analysis and no cure for Procrastinators,"It does a nice job analyzing why people procrastinate. Lot of whining, no solutions... A waste of my time and money."
2,Procrastination by Jane B. Burka,"It has not inspired me - I have read some books that are more to my liking - I find this one ""boring."""
5,Looks good but I haven't read it yet.,"It's a book about procrastination and I am sure its good, I just haven't gotten around to read it yet. I am sure I will one. day."
4,good for organizing workflow,"If you are reading this and there is something else you really should be doing.. go do it. This book does not help you get up and start doings things as much as it helps you to create more efficient workflow. When you aren't quick to get up and do your day-to-day work, that is usually a personal dilemma that can't be solved by the author of a book who hasn't met you or your individual life."
4,Insanely Helpful,I can't say I'd ever rate anything a 5 since it implies perfect but this book is pretty close. Knowing why you do something is a HUGE help in figuring out how to overcome it and this book does an outstanding job of that.
1,"Don't bother. Read ""The Now Habit"" instead.","This book is long on fluff and short on concrete advice. What useful advice it does contain is largely the same as inThe Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play, a book half as long. I believe that the authors of this book worked at the UC Berkeley counseling center at the same time as Neil Fiore, who wrote the latter book. If that's a coincidence it's a pretty unlikely one.The authors are also obsessed with procrastination caused by being the first in your family or community to go to college. I don't doubt that this is a real phenomenon, but it applies to maybe one one-hundredth of one percent of the potential readership."
5,Simply the best medieval social history for the elementary crowd,"With the rather facile title of the series, I had no great expectations--but WOW! what a wonderful book to counter all the misconceptions about the middle ages that are promulgated even in many adults' books! I adore it. If you only get one book that touches on the social history of the middle ages, this should be it!"
4,Fun little book.,This is a fun little book. I use it with my high school students when we study literature from this era.
4,A Must For Release Engineers-Best 0-60 Speed In Class,"I needed something that would help me master Ant in as little time as possible. This is the book. The book gives fundamentals as well as cook book examples. You could click thru the free Ant doc online, but this book will get you up and running in the least amount of time.It also has a section on extending Ant. From my searching, this book is the only good resource on extending and customizing Ant. Both a good starter book and a good reference book."
2,Blah Blah Blah - Weak,This book has alot of text but weak on info. I quickly glazed over due to the fact that there was alot to wade through to find the nuggets of information. The reference part of the book is lacking. This book is NOT very helpful if you are trying to get up to speed quickly.
3,Track Listing for this obscure title,Track Listing:1) Deve Ser Amor2) Choro Para Metronome3) Adagio4) Berimbau5) Samba Em Preludio6) Chanson D' Hiver7) Samba Triste8) Beceuse A Jussara9) Prelude10) Euridice11) Bachiana12) Garota De Ipanema
4,Great for understanding codes,"this book is great for class, and understanding all that codes includes, as it is a hard subject. This book is very clear and has lots of examples as well as diagrams to help understand even further. This is not the most interesting book, but then neither is the subject."
4,More information than you'd ever want to know about codes ...,"A necessary evil for the responsible interior designer. Overall the book is well written and informative, although the side 'tips' and 'notes' can get a little crazy. Still, I don't believe there's anything else like this out there, so if you need it, get it."
4,"Pretty good, lots of information!","So far seems to be a very good book. TONS of information. You will definitely learn a lot. My one complaint is that it tends to give two slightly different answers to the same question. So if you would look at page 10 and it would say this, it might say something different on 12. That comes up frequently when we are grading quizzes. Other than that, a very good book!"
4,Good for interior design students- must have,Good for interior design students- must have this book to understand how to comply with todays' design laws.
5,"This edition has been revised, updated and expanded to include many changes and more detailed coverage","The fourth updated edition of Sharon Koomen Harmon, IIDA and AIA Katherine E. Kennon's THE CODES GUIDEBOOK FOR INTERIORS is a 'must' for any in-depth architecture or design reference library. It's the only guide devoted exclusively to codes relating to interiors alone, and explains all standards, federal regulations, maintenance of commercial and residential interiors alike, and more. This edition has been revised, updated and expanded to include many changes and more detailed coverage.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
2,Good story but predictable,Read it for book club. Seemed like every management book I was required to read before I retired and wasn't thrilled with it. Others in my club loved it though.
4,Book Purchase,"Book required for summer school reading. It arrived quickly and in good shape, and is a good read."
1,this book sucked,This was the most boring and cliche book i have ever read. it was written at about a 2nd grade level and everything about it was unoriginal and cliche
1,The Traveler's Gift,Don't waste your money. A self help book with tips you see a million different places.
5,great presentation!,Great presentation and story line that captured our attention on a long drive! Would make a great gift any time of the year!
4,Wonderful Book,"I read it thinking it was going to be another self-improvement book, but this story is gripping and many people will be able to relate. It definitely motivated me."
5,Traveler's Gift Review,I was given a copy of this book from my sister. I was so impressed by it that I've since purchased six more copies of it to give away. I will be giving this book away alot as graduation gifts.
5,Loved it... Powerful!,"This is a remarkable parable for success in living. I don't want to give anything away, but I truly loved this book."
3,Reasonably Good,"'The Traveler's Gift' is part novel and part self help book. It is not great on either count, but it is fairly good.The self help part contains a lot of advice that can be found a lot of places such as seek wisdom, forgive others, and be persistent. There are four other 'lessons' as well. None of it is too Earth shattering.The story is about a man, David Ponder, who loses his job, has a daughter with medical problems, is broke, etc. He has pretty much given up on life. He then begins a science fiction journey of traveling to various places and encountering various historical figures including Harry Truman, Abraham Lincoln, Anne Frank, King Solomon, and others. The story is somewhat entertaining, but again, it is nothing too great.This is not a bad book to read, but one may not want to put it at the top of the reading list."
5,Life-changing!!!!,"A remarkable book about an individual who has no hope in life, but has a life changing experience, which gives us hope as well!"
5,great book,"Good transaction, speedy delivery. Very pleased with the book. It was interesting and thought provoking. I loved the book, and I sent it to someone who needed help to forgive."
5,"Historical Wisdom, Real-life Application",This book's a great way to start the year! Andrews' use of historical events to teach life lessons really gets the message across. Recommended reading for turbulent times.
5,Best book class,"The Traveler's Gift, an unexpected surprise! One of the best books I have ever read. It will inspire and lift you up!"
4,A treasured book!,"""I have bought almost 100 copies of this book over the years. I have given it as gifts to family, friends and my students. It is well written and weaves us through an very interesting story of meeting famous people through history that teach us lessons that make us a better person. I LOVE THIS BOOK! This is a CLASSIC! It will always be in my treasured book collection! """
5,I was really impressed,"This book hits all the great points of previous ""self-help"" authors, but the format puts a fresh spin on things. I'm naturally a somewhat negative, perfectionist that's always looking to criticize. I hate that about me. The only thing I could criticize about this book was the over-use of the word, ""frowned"" as most every character did at one time in the book. Other than that, this book was amazing...I mean, literally amazing. I really and truly couldn't put it down. The descriptions of events made me feel as if I was standing there with the main character. Very much an engaging story with excellent choices for the historical characters. This is one of my favorite books of all time. And my only other criticism is that the book had to end...I wanted to keep going. Fantastic, Andy. Thank you for the gift of The Travelers Gift!"
5,The Travel's Gift is an unforgettable tour,"When you read The Traveler's Gift, you may feel as though Andy Andrews was spying on you. The situation that he describes inthe beginning of his book is so real and unfortunately all to familiar to a lot of us -- being jobless and having no money or insurance for medical expenses.The way that Andy uses his knowledge of history, people and a little bit of imagination creates a book that is almost impossible to set down.You will love this book if you are a history buff, you are going through a crisis (or know someone in a crisis), you are a leader (or seek to become a leader) or if you just enjoy a well-told story."
5,I didn't want to put it down!,I got the book after the recommendation from a good friend. I have not been much of book reader in the past. I do read magazines and newspapers. I found myself not wanting to stop reading and allow myself to get some sleep. In the past I have found it very difficult to finish a book at all. I finished this book in less than a week even with a very busy schedule. I am sure the the principles found in the book are not really new but will receive new meaning after reading the book. I highly recommend it.
5,Excellent Read! My Favorite new book!,"The title of this book caught my eye at my local library since I am an avid traveler. However, at the time of check-out, I didn't realize what a jewel I had really found. Once I started reading this book, I couldn't stop until I had finished it. I laughed, I cried and I took to heart the motivating decisions for success that we all know and so often forget when pit against the everyday perils of life. This book is so inspiring that I have circulated copies for everyone in my family to read, especially when they're feeling down. It's not about one man becoming a success and, as one reader put it ""building fancy buildings"". What the book really emphasizes is believing in yourself and pursuing your goals despite facing adversity. I highly recommend this book to anyone as I think it is the best book I have ever read."
4,The Traveler's Gift,"The Traveler's Gift, by Andy Andrews is an execellent book. It is also a self-help book for personal success. It's about a guy who is down on his luck and he somehow goes back in time to meet a bunch of famous people from our history. The people he meets teach him about life and success. They help teach him not to blame others for his problems, among other things. It is a great book that makes everyone think about things in a different way. I recommend everyone read this book, it's worth the buy."
4,Keep Reading,"I really enjoyed The Traveler's Gift, but I had to keep reading through the fist couple of chapters. It took me a while to get through the ""Quantum Leaps"" taken by the main character - once I did the lessons are those we have all heard before, taught in a new manner - all you need to do is apply."
3,interesting,Andy Andrews' books are always interesting and well written. I read it fast and may read it again someday.....his concepts are enlightening.
5,Excellent reading,I have read this several times which I hardly ever read a book twice. This copy was sent to a friend who also loved it.
4,Good book,"I read The Traveler's Gift as part of a book club at my workplace. As an educator who works with teens, I was excited at the prospect of locating an inspirational book that incorporated a taste of history. The Traveler's Gift is a great read that I enjoyed. While the lessons taught in the book were valuable, they were not quite what I expected...which is why I only give the book 4 stars. It was engaging, but not one of those ""I can't bear to put it down"" type of books. I do recommend the book, especially if you enjoy history and seeing what can be learned from various historical figures. The part that I enjoyed most was The Traveler's encounter with Anne Frank; I felt as if I were there. The ending was a bit abrupt; I felt as if there should be something more afterward. Overall, though, it was a great book and well worth purchasing."
5,Delivered in good condition,"As soon as my credit card went through, the book was on it's way. I would recommend this book to anyone... anyone! Andy Andrews does a great job at making the reader feel the emotions of the book. I would also recommend this bookstore and will reorder again with them in the future!"
5,WOW!,WOW! What an awesome book! I couldnt put it down. I was assigned this book to read for a Leadership class that I'm taking and loved it! The author has a wonderful way of making a point using historical characters.Fantastic book!
5,Wonderful book.,I took this book to a drug and alcohol recovery center. It gave them something positive to read. The book helps you look at the opportunities we are given in life and the way the choices we make influence our lives.
5,A Gift To Us All,"A friend passed on her copy of this wonderful book to me. She blessed me with a ""gift."" Andy Andrews writes a wonderful history-filled story that passes on the secrets of being personally successful. The last of the seven decisions really spoke to me, and will probably change my life. This is definitely a book that everyone should read!"
2,Lacks substance,"I love to read and this book came highly recommended. I am a picky reader, but also have a hard time putting any good book down. I put this one down a dozen times, but was committed to finishing it. I was convinced that I would come out the better for it. The upside of this not being true is that it is another testament to me that history books and scripture are all the motivation I need.I will not go into detail regarding the plot or authenticity of characters and events in the book. There are a fair shair of motivational words that are thought-provoking, but nothing with substance. The book is very ""wordy"" and the end is beyond cheesy and disappointing. As the author teaches that faith is one of the 7 decisions he allows his main character to see his own highly successful future. Where is the faith in that?"
1,"I WAS NOT INSPIRED, I WAS BORED!!!","Okay,I tried to read the whole thing, word-for-word.Yyyyaaawwwnnn, wow, was that boring. Too, too muchyackiting-yak. Yeah, yeah, pick yourself up by the boot-straps, dust yourself off, yeah, yeah."
1,"Ambitious, but falls short...","Sorely lacking in depth and complexity, The Traveler's Gift is an ambitious idea that falls short of satisfaction. Each visit had great potential, but fell flat from sparse handling. Unfortunately, while the seven decisions are each compelling on their own, I was left unsettled by the characterization of the successful christian life that becomes David Ponder's life at book's end."
1,"painful, even","This is one of the worst books I have ever read.it's simply one cliche after another.teaching us who to admire, and who to be.i suppose the author meant well,but what the man goes through at the beginning of the book (such as being fired right as his neglected daughter needs her tonsils removed) is all a bit too contrived and predictable, really.and, besides. these seven messages don't really mean anything until you've experienced something that can help you understand them.your life improved with experience.and mistakes aren't a bad thing.i mean after all, as mr. 'harry truman' put it .. we aren't given the ability to make the right choice all the time, but we have been given the ability to fix our mistakes.so. learn from life, not this book.i hated it.i'd like to live my life without cliches. :)"
2,Lots of imperfect assumptions and unrealistic views,"All of a sudden Harry Truman is supposed to be the authority on truth?It's interesting that his claims are never questioned - sort of like religious faith.Lot's of religious undertones and unrealistic claims such as ""every decision you make carves out your destiny"".Yeah, what about the decisions your parents made?This book is full of the old nice, idealistic but unrealistic addages of work hard and you'll reap the rewards.Someone is not living in the real world."
1,I don't see anything new or interesting here,"It's fascinating how people so greatly differ in their evaluation of books, movies, etc. There are people smarter than I am who probably love this book, but I didn't. Sometimes when this happens, I want to look deeper and try to see what they see, figure out what I've missed. Not this time.This is simply a really bad book. I attempted to get past the writing to see if the author has anything interesting to say, but came up with nothing but cliches. If this were written by my teenage son for an english project, I'd say, ""Good job."" But to publish it? Well, haven't most of us long stopped needing this kind of thing?"
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I judge the books I read by making a decision as to whether to buy the books for my children or not. This is one book that I will purchase for all 4 of my kids; it is that good! It is written in novel form but with a strong message. I also purchased the audio version and what I like is that I can select a specific track and listen just to the 7 different decision messages which are written in the form of affirmations. This book confirms my strong opinion that out minds are just like computers, you put garbage in and you get garbage out. This book gives the reader the opportunity to put quality in and get quality out! The messages are so powerful to me that I created a wall chart with all seven decisions on it and it is posted prominently over my desk where I can review it every day! The book holds your interest while at the same time giving you great affirmations to live your life by. I highly recommend the book be included in everyone's personal library."
4,"Good, quick read that makes you think.",I don't usually have time for reading - but I picked this book up and read it in a few hours (and I'm a slow reader). Though it's not long - it is an interesting story that definitely makes you think. I enjoyed the book.
2,Lightweight . . .,"After reading reviews on the book, I went out and bought it. I was able to put the book down, in fact, I was able to to it three times. While I am sure many will get take away some useful tidbit, overall, I found the book lightweight in its seven decisions - no real life changing motivation. The one part I did enjoy was learning the story of the Civil War hero, if only from the historical point of view.I found myself comparing the book to Og Mandino's book, The Greatest Miracle In The World"" which I found to be a wonderful read. The Traveler's Gift style resembles what Og Mandino often did in his books - tell a story and incorporate life lessons. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way.A nice book but not worthy of all the hype it has been receiving."
4,A life renewed !,I wish this book had been around when I was younger. Modern times produce new stresses.The advice given in this book is timeless and can indeed renew attitudes and lead to betterlives.
2,Can't regift this one,"A family man lives paycheck to paycheck so when he loses his job, he despairs, runs his car into a tree then dreams of visiting famous historical characters who give him the seven keys to a successful life.If you don't mind being hit over the head with the entire barn (not just a 2x4) and can overlook historical errors, you may give this book a higher rating than I.Someone at the book discussion called this a book for the ""Amway crowd."" It certainly shouldn't have been for our literary book discussion."
4,nice easy read,"This was stimulating at a level that was not very profound, but probably good enough for most people who have not had the benefit of analytical thinking."
4,An uplifting read,"I'm not typically a reader of motivational books, but I enjoyed this book, eagerly turning pages to find out who the protagonist would meet next and what wisdom would be imparted. I previously knew of Andy Andrews primarily as a comedian, but The Traveler's Gift shows that there's substance behind his smile. I'm planning to have my pre-teen son read this book, which would make great reading for any young person (or not-so-young person) who needs to have some of life's big lessons reinforced."
2,Interesting approacch to encouragement,"Seven decisions to change your life; yet after two chapters it was easy to see where the author was taking us. The only thing that kept me reading was to see which person David was going to meet.It's easy reading and doesn't take long to read. In fact I read it on a plane between Los Angeles and Atlanta and still had time for a nap.If someone is uncertain about how to affect a change in their life, read this."
5,The perfect inspirational gift this season,"Each reader will feel that author Andy Andrews wrote this book just for them. They will want to purchase several to give to family, friends, and most likely their minister."
3,Shallow,"I read a lot of motivational books as it is one of my favorite genres, and while this author sought to be another Og Mandino, he has a way to go. The myths used to illustrate the principles he was seeking to teach don't accomplish the goal. Take for example his visit with Lincoln and the discussion with Grant. Grant was an alcoholic. Lincoln is portrayed in this scene as a ""win whatever it takes"" man, i.e., all the other generals had let him down and Grant could do no wrong. Historical ambiguities are lost in this ""dream state"" we're given in this broad sweep of people, places, and events. It's shallow! I was annoyed by little things throughout the whole book. The ""teacher"" who turned the whole of history around by one action in the civil war....is another example. Bogus! This guy is the only one who was right and took the right course of action? According to this author. I think more research and a few more rough drafts are in order."
1,Ouch...,I hate to pan books. I really wanted and tried to like this book. What I read on the cover sounded wonderful so I went into it with the best of intentions. What I learned was the best part was the cover! This book is trite and badly written. It is painfully so which is why I titled this Ouch. Please pass this book and get something better if you want motivational try The Four Agreements or Touching Spirit Bear.
4,Excellent book!,"This is a must read book! It can be a life altering book, with specific events throughout history, which you can apply to everyday problems. The book was not long and boring, but got straight to the message of self-governance, and perseverance."
5,Change your life!,"That's what this book did for me--changed my life, made me face many things I had swept under the rug at the back of my brain. Use with the Traveler's Gift Journal for maximum impact."
4,the notorious rake,"As a Balogh lover, I really enjoyed this one. The action comes fast and furious early on. The rake is so despicable at times that one has to wonder how it's going to work out. A lot of fun!"
2,Insecure hero insults heroine who then falls in love,"Mary Balogh sells well. Some of her books I like. Many people like every thing she writes, but I find you have to expect to come across the odd rape, perhaps the hero and heroine indulging in premarital intercourse in the first few pages. A little too dramatic for my tastes. This one does have a father calling his son (the hero) a murderer following the death of his brother with a family reconcilation after x years and a hero who goes out of his way to be unpleasant to people."
5,An Excellent Video,"This is an excellent program about love from well known spiritual and self help people such as Deepak Chopra, Carolyn Myss, Marianne Williamson... The quest Love Trilogy, includes #1 Love Passion Soul, #2 Soul Mates, #3 Ecstacy. Each of the three programs are substantive, because the 6 or 7 people on each tape are so insightful, what they say about spirituality and love conveys a deep insight into living a soulful life. The Love series tapes are not just about love, but how to live authentically and with power. I enjoyed the soul mates one the most because it touches on all relationships in your life. They are all worth purchasing, as are the Life Trilogy Quest Programs. You won't get so much insight in such a compact form from any other video series."
2,Already rusting after three months,"After first opening the package I was very impressed with the weight, the feel of the knives and how extremely sharp they were. Now that I've used them for a few months I'm still impressed with how well they cut but I'm starting to notice rust spots. I have never put them in the dishwasher nor let them soak in water for any length of time. At first it was only the smaller of the knives and though I wasn't happy I could have received a single bad blade. Now all three are showing small rust spots. I have owned much less quality knives and not taken nearly as good care of them and non of the previous sets have rusted. These knives are not worth the money you pay for them. I'm still giving two stars due to the fact that the knives are well balanced and sharp but for this price I would like them to last too."
5,I LOVE these Knives!,"I got these knives as a birthday present about 6 months ago and I LOVE them! I have had to sharpen them a couple of times using an electric sharpener, but I think that it is because others in my house refuse to use the sharpening steel. For the most part, these knives are awesome to work with, they get back to new-sharp quicker than any knife I've ever used. They are fairly lightweight, yet I have no problem quartering a chicken with them. These are a great buy!"
3,Barely ok,"These knives don't seem to be the same Henckels quality as the other Henckel knives I own. These are made in China, maybe that's why they seem to be poorer quality. The heft and balance isn't as nice, though how well they keep their edge remains to be seen."
5,A Must Read,"The author gives a detailed account of the intimate events in his life. The perfectly placed poems and poetic wording throughout this book really allows the reader to feel what he was feeling, and see what he was seeing. It is not often that a book touches on so many different issues people can relate to, and this book does just that. Some subjects discussed are the struggles of being a single parent, being depressed and suicidal, having a troubled childhood, finding a religion, and finding love. Subjects discussed are deep and may seem dark, but the story is filled with constant hope and determination. I recommend this book to everyone I know who can appreciate a piece of art, such as this. To the author...I thank you for sharing your story with me."
1,!!!,it was small and it's made by bad wood !!!!!!!!and that doesn't say in its information !you should put more information about this stuff
1,Opened the bottle - stinks to high heaven!,"I am not sure when the odorless part starts (after ingesting????) because I am afraid to try taking it now that I have received it and smelled it. I bought it and opened it, so now I can't return it. I am out of a good bit of money and I couldn't choke down one of these caps if I tried. They stink something fierce. I am pretty frugal and pretty adventuresome, however in this case I am afraid if I take these caps I will stink like they do. I have a job dealing with the public, and do not want to offend my family or pets either, so I will have to take a loss on this product. Buyer beware! If I could give lower than 1 star I would."
3,Murphet Creates Magic,"Murphet's book is so readable and utterly compelling that even the most cynical reader can be duped by the many stories of Sai Baba's miracles. Only the most rationale will note that David Copperfield could duplicate or better most of them. Murphet claims to have started as a cynic and ended as a devotee; although the accounts he relates are interesting enough to make many a spiritual seeker hop on the plane to India, the investigation is neither thorough nor scientific."
1,"Sai Baba, Man or God?","Howard Murphet has shown himself to be a very inaccurate and fanciful reporter of many events. He claimed, for example, that Hitler was persuaded when he made the final decision to invade the USSR by the influence of Sri Aurobindo of India! But Hitler had planned this for many years, and the invasion plans had been in full operation since the end of the Battle of Britain. A man who claims such absurd things cannot be trusted not to have been duped by his own desires to experience miracles and more. Therefore, this book is highly suspect from beginning to end."
2,Don't buy this book,this is not a very good Baba book. Purty's is better but hard to find in this country.
5,Excellent book on Sai Baba.,"This book touched me personally. When I first read it, my heart jumped and I decided to go see him in India for myself. Well, having seen him three times- sans the miracles mentioned in the book, the inner transformation is what left the deepest impression. Vivikananda said, you can try to perform all the religious techniques & such, but unless an Over Soul lights the pilot flame within you, you'll get nowhere. So it was for me, a Christian."
3,"Nice Looking Fan, But Not That Powerful","Good looking fan, I have found that it is not so easy to find a silver/black fan. The normal colors seem to all be gold and wood grain. The fan is quiet and does not wobble at all, even on the highest setting. The only downsides is that this fan is not a powerful as the one it replaced. The CFM rating on the box is around 5000 cfm where as the on that it replaced was above 7000 cfm. No where on the internet i could find how powerful the fan was so i had no idea about how powerful this fan really was. Also the remote that came with the fan didn't work but all-in-all this is a good fan for a master bedroom or smaller room."
3,nice fan but lights have mind of their own,"This fan looks really nice and creates great air movement, even when on low. This fan comes with a remote for both the fan and the light and YOU MUST USE THE REMOTE IN ORDER TO USE THE FAN!! We were unaware of this when we purchased the fan. There are no cords to pull on this fan (which is very eye-pleasing), but the only way to control the fan is through the remote. This sometimes causes problems. We have had the fan up for about a month and we occassionally have the lights turn off or on spontaneously. We can be sitting on the couch and the lights will turn off randomly. Overall, the fan is very nice but beware of the remote control and random lights turning off and on. Also installation can be tricky because of the remote control sensor within the fan."
2,Be aware it only use candle base bulbs,"Just bought the fan 2 weeks ago for the living room. Planned to use it as the main light sourse of the room(20X15)but found out this fan can only use candle base light bulb and currently the maximum wattage for candle base bulb is 60W. All other fans in my house all use regular light bulbs and this is not in the detail specifications of this product. Already spent $$$ for installation(15' ceiling) so can't return the fan. Have to wait till higher wattage candle base CFL bulbs produced. As to the appearance, the old fan without lighting kit I replaced looked better."
5,Great Fan!,"Compared to what other fans cost, with a remote, at Home Depot or Lowes, I got this for a great deal at Amazon. Fan was easy to assemble & puts out a lot of air. I have this fan in my study & can't even put it on high, as it will blow papers around. Also, what I like about the fan is that you can choose the amount of light it outputs. It's starts off low light & by holding down the remote, you can make the lights pretty bright.I have 2 other Hunter Douglas ceiling fans, with remotes, that are within 20-25 feet of each other. I have had no problems with the remotes controlling the fans."
4,Hunter Fan Westurbury,I purchased 2 of these fans and so far they have worked fine. They are quite attractive with the dark almost pewter looking light kit and fan body. The electrician put them up without any problems. They both have remotes which are cool but once in a while the fans lights will just turn on spontaneously which is a tiny bit spooky!
4,Nice Fan with Remote!,Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase. The fan looks great and I love the remote! We have had some issues with the fan turning on/off at random times...but it does not happen with enough frequency to bother us.
3,mythical beast returns to rack up body count,"Yep this is one of those movies where an ancient evil is unearthed to wipe out everyone it comes across. Charlie Murphy and Russell Means were both good in this. Some of the moments of action were really good. The tragic backstory of the sheriff sort of petered out though. And everything was really dark and hard to see. Overall, despite all these complaints the movie was not horrible, but not super great either."
4,Worth it.,"I saw this film last year at the Tribecca Film festival and was quite pleased with the production value. Apparently it was pretty low budget, but with the special effects, and stunts (explosions etc.) the film makers definitely got their monies worth. The characters are also extremely rich for a horror film, which I found refreshing. Not the same old teen, sexy, slash em up film. This film actually has mystery and character development. Charlie Murphy is also quite humorous in it as well. This one is definitely worth seeing."
2,Its ok,"If you are bored, and too tired to take a nap, then you could watch it. Not scary, low budget, and stupid."
2,No!,Want to get bored watching the creature from the Aliens movies chase a car around the desert? This movie's for you. Are you a fan of the After Dark Horror movies but feel that some of them don't live up to expectations? This is definitely one of the top installments to avoid. The only way I could fathom this movie being any worse was if it had a lot lower budget and the creature was some halloween costume from Wal-Mart. Actually maybe that would have made it more amusing. Unfortunately this doesn't make the so-good-it's-bad list either. Just boring all around. Skip it.
2,Worse than I expected....,"I had high hopes for this one...I thought it would be at least decent. I watched the first hour and my boyfriend and I both fell asleep. When we finished the movie later, we were disappointed. The creature looks sooooo fake. The first time it really shows it when it jumps on the back of the truck I busted out laughing. Before that, I still thought it could be good. But it didn't get any better. I had read that it was a cross between tremors and alien...well, yea, it looks like a second hand version of the aliens in alien, and, yea, this comes underground...but it just didn't work. I think Tremors is 10 times better, but that just might be because I've always loved Tremors. And Alien...well, lets be serious...this just doesn't compete. So far the one I have disliked the most out of the horrorfest."
3,Aliens Creature,Great!! Picture reminds me of the Aliens Creature But this one will scare your Pants off.. Much Powerful then Aliens Creature...
2,Only covers huge structures... not much here for small builders...,"The picture on the front cover says it all - this book might be useful if you are designing or making large Bamboo structures but it gives no advice about using Bamboo to make a real house to live in.It's not a ""How to"" book - I can't recommend it."
2,VGA to RCA Cable,"This product does not do what I needed it to do. I needed a cable to go from my laptop to project the screen onto my HDTV because my laptop screen is no longer functioning. This cable was recommended to me for this purpose, but the only thing I see on my TV screen is black. The reviews were all over the place in that some people got it to work and others didn't. It would be nice to know which laptop models work with this cable and the true use of the cable."
1,missleading,"should have read all the reviews because if i had, i would not have bought this junk. will think twice about using amazon to buy cables. not sure who is to blame, amazon for listing this junk even with all the bad reviews just to make a buck!! or the seller for giving bad details."
1,BOOOO!!! ONLY USE WITH PROJECTOR,"If you are looking for a simple way to connect your laptop to your television then do your homework. Do not buy this product, otherwise...like many other reviews, I feel like another sucker with a POS wire with no discernible purpose."
1,Doesn't work,Doesn't work tried it on three different tv's and got weerd lines with all resolutions tried interlaced and progressive scan.
2,Doesn't work at all,Since i bought this cord i have been trying to connect it from my laptop to several RCA Tv connections and i could not find the way to get it work! if somebody did it please help me on this matter cause i bought a cord that can't use at all and i fell that i loose my money as i live outside U.S. and i can't claim a money back reward. my email is as juliopenab@hotmail.com thanks
3,Does not have the right length,"I specifically ordered the 25 ft (7.62 m) cable above to make sure I had enough length. I just received my order - everything else was OK, but this cable was only 12 ft, half the size it was supposed to be. I will make do with it for now, but I am not happy - will not order from this seller again."
1,Doesn't do it!,"Hooking this up to your splitter, DVD player, equalizer, or TV does nto work. Don't be fooled. Not sure what you need to hook up Netflix and Hulu etc from your PC to your TV but it is most definitely NOT this thing though it seems like it would work to the layman."
5,Need Advice,"Don't know if anyone can help ... I'm trying to find a long cable that will connect a Projector (using its' VGA) to connect to a Home Theater Receiver (using its' RCA). The projector only has two other hook-ups (one RCA & one S-Video). I have a CATV box using one, and a DVD player using the other. I'm trying to add an XBox 360 to the set-up, hooking it directly to the HT Reciver, but need to free up one input. If I can successfully link the Proj & HT Receiver it will solve all problems I think.I keep reading conflicting info about these VGA-to-RCA cables; I would hate to waste money on one if it's not going to work.Any helpful hints/advice would be greatly appreciated."
5,Great cable.,It does a great job of connecting my cable box(component) to my projector(vga) at 720p.
2,Know before you buy,I'm not sure if it is just my luck or if this item is useless but it does not work. So I suggest that BEFORE you buy it you think very hard if its going to work. I would say ask the seller for guidance but in my case I think my seller was based in Asia so the communication skills that I found was rather disappointing.Good luck to you and take care.
2,wires too thin,"when i got this wire, installed it, it worked for a few minutes then color on projector turned green, i touched wire, it turned back to normal, after a while it turned green again, bad construction..."
3,Great cord but...,great cord but i never ended up using it. I had to throw it away when i moved. So i knocked off a star because of that.
3,cable,Actually it seems to be and exelent product but for me i did not work. i try it with a projector and a tv did not work with either of them.
1,Cable Did Not Work,Tried the cable on two different HDTV's and two different laptops. It simply didn't work. The TV's went blank and said they weren't receiving a signal. Ended up buying a Belkin VGA to VGA cable and it worked perfectly.
2,Not too pleased,"The product is okay, but the response from Import Tuner Mag has been VERY, VERY slow. Do not plan on renewing subscription again!"
3,Where is my subscription?,"The magazine itself is a great magazine. Only thing is, I know this because of reading it at a book store. I gifted a subscription to my boyfriend in Nov. 2011 and have yet to receive an issue. Amazon.com was very helpful in trying to help me find out the issue but even though the address was correct and we checked with the mailing service, we still haven't received an issue. Amazon is issuing me a refund."
4,Step by step script to bring Whole-Scale in practice,"This book is the complement to ""Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations"". It won't be of much use without the other volume, since it describes in small detail (by the hour) how to run a whole-scale workshop, the preparatory sessions, etc. However, if you want to bring it in practice, than you HAVE to buy this book. I'm amazed that consultants are giving away such a treasure chest of information: if you have ""what it takes"", you can really *do* this without needing their help (of course, some emotional intelligence, as explained in ""7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence"", will be of help.)"
2,just ok,"the zippered access areas in the back are badly designed and make it nearly impossible to get to the battery leads to hook your charger up too. also it would have been nice to have the round ice transducer ""cup"" built into the base of the unit for storing one of those. otherwise it was easy to set up, and i like the quick disconnect for the transducer cable."
3,nice,basically the case is as expected. Delivery was timely. I have been using it. There are two drawbacks so far storing the transducer for transport you either have to disconnect it or there is a cord hanging out and it is very inconveniet to connect the charger when recharging
2,Missing parts.,There were crucial parts missing for the mounting base. I'm contacting Humminbird to get those parts. This was a Christmas gift.
2,Don't buy this!,"I can't even fully describe my disappointment with this toy. It is a piece of plastic junk and breaks easily.I was so excited that Transformers was making a come back! I loved them when I was a kid and was looking forward to sharing it with my kids. And what do I get for my $20.00, garbage!"
4,Works good for WVO and diesel systems,I use this gauge to let me know when I am getting a clogged filter in my wvo and diesel systems on my VW diesel. No fuel pump just the injection pump sucking. Works good and normally is under 2psi till a filter starts to clog and I know right when that starts to happen because of this gauge. It does seam like it might have a bit of a leak as fluid works it's way up the line but diesel and wvo haven't seamed to affect the gauge yet.
2,not a bargain,"I haven't even removed this gauge from its package because I can see that the needle does not line up at all with the zero. Its not like its off a little, NO its way off. Don't know how something like this could get by quality control. I guess this is my fault for cheaping out on a boost gauge but I bought this one because it was the closest match to all the stock VDO brand gauges my car came with."
5,still chugging along,used this on the pod provided specifically for the brand and size and so far so good after about 2 to 3 months of almost daily use.
5,Boost Gauge,My husband and I purchased the sunpro boost gauge and it works great. It comes with a built in pod and everything.
5,Hoping for many more from Haley!,"I picked up this book after watching the movie, and I've read it at least five times since then. The movie is great, but, when I have the time, I'd rather read the book. The characters are so rich, painted in full with both strengths and weaknesses, that they feel like real people. What makes me fall in love with them and keep returning to this book is the way the characters relate to one another, the way they just fit together and take care of one another. The whole perspective on life is just simple and good. Oh, and the plot is incredibly well-crafted. But I'm more into characters, so it took a few reads before I really started to appreciate the structure of the plot:)If you do like this book, Haley has a few other treasures out there that are well-worth the read. ""Nest of Singing Birds"" and ""The Murder of Medicine Bear"" are my shortlist."
5,All in perspective now...,Bought the Urantia papers earlier this year and needed to know the background of how this came to be.I thank you for clearing up and putting the final touches to a great piece of work.I love the book for it's guiding work and am a true believer now because of your input.Thank you
3,groundbreaking,The Sex & Race Trilogy took J.A. Rogers years to research and write and contains little known facts and some remarkable picutures. For those who think interracial romance is something new the books will be a complete shock. Rogers was convinced that love knew no color line and uses hundredss of historical cases to prove it.
5,Sex and Race,"I've always had an interest in history and how history has moulded us into today's world.This volume and volume one has enabled me to look at all races differently. It has enabled me to realise that all races are connected by blood (despite it being forced in the past, or consensually today) I loved this book and couldn't put it down."
4,Nice set,"This is a nice set, just wish it came with a bag and a putter, but everything else that you need is there. It's very sturdy, and nicely made."
3,Good Clubs,Researched the clubs a bit and was not disappointed. I'm a medium golfer looking to upgrade my existing Wilson Pro Staff Clubs. Perfect fit for my pocket book and skill set. I normally drive with my 3 wood but have had good success with the Driver included in this set.If your not exactly ready for a good set of Cobra or Ping clubs these are a good choice.
4,So far so good,"I've done three peels so far and am happy with the results. It definitely burns when you put it on, so I've only been able to tolerate it for about 4 minutes. It has shrunk my existing acne dramatically each time I've used it. The next day I wake up and it's almost all gone. I've also noticed that my skin is much less oily and my pores much smaller. I notice that I peel two days later - which is annoying, but what gets the results. I just make sure I use a heavier moisturizer on that day and night, and I exfoliate with a facial sponge and that takes care of it quickly. I am also using Clinique's acne solution system and started both around the same time, so it may be the combination of the two that's producing the results. But either way, I'm very happy with how well my skin is looking these days. Can't wait to see the results of another month of use."
2,Haven't noticed a difference,"I used this twice a week for 6 weeks and didn't notice a difference in my acne at all. My skin got incredibly dry, which is to be expected, but no difference other than that. I'm disappointed as I read such other great reviews."
4,Looking forward to seeing more.,"After reading all these amazing reviews on this product and having no luck with getting rid of my past acne scars I went ahead and bought this with high hopes. They were unfortunately too high. I've been using this product now for about a 2 weeks, almost everyday. The first few times I only left it on for maybe 2 minutes at a time. (Perhaps that is why I am not thrilled with my results thus far) The past two times I've left it on for 5 minutes. I took a before and after photo from when I first started to last night and I honestly see no difference. I MAY have some less acne, but I definitely do not see a huge difference. I was really just hoping this would help me with my past scarring and overall appearence of my face. I will continue to use it maybe... I purchased the pH Balancer from Cellbone to use after the peel, with the Balancer, Cellbone included a free 35% Gylocolic Lactic Peel - I used this ONCE, MUCH BIGGER DIFFERENCE! I may still use this, I may not."
1,Who's giving these reviews?!,"With all the glowing commendations for this product, I figured I couldn't go wrong by purchasing it. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I followed the directions; I didn't leave it on longer than 8 minutes, and I didn't use it more than once a week. I rinsed with cool water and used a noncomodogenic moisturizer afterwards. I didn't lay out in the sun. Now, 6 or 7 weeks later, my skin has never been in such terrible condition. Where I was only having mild breakouts before, my face now resembles that of my acne scarred adolescence. I cringe when I look in the mirror. Please, save yourself some trouble and DO NOT buy this product."
5,Great peel!,"This is as good as it gets professional result. Unlike the direction that come with the bottle, which I do not find effective enough, I experimented and it worked really well for me. Here is my own direction: I place a few drops of gel into my palm. Then I massage it into my face and let it sit overnight when I sleep. It stings but it's tolerable and fanning it helps a little bit, too, but do not wash it off. The stinging sensation will die down after 30 minutes.For 2-3 days afterwards, the skin begin to exfolidate and peel, revealing fresh pink skin underneath, just like the result of the $70 facial professional job. Be sure to put on sunscreen and moisturister to protect the young skin, especially under strong sun. Happy peeling!"
4,Very pleased!,"I've been using this peel for four weeks now and I really see a difference. I've paid $250.00 for a professional peel & have seen the same results. My pores are smaller and complexion is clearer. I've gone from a full coverage make up to tinted coverage and and couldn't be more pleased. I'm 50 ""something"". No acne, no problems, just want better looking skin. I will finish out this bottle and then go to the 35. I really recommend this product to whom ever is reading this as well as my friends. It's about time we as consumers can buy a product such as this at a fair price."
5,Works better than I expected,"I have heard a lot about this acid and decided it was time to try it for myself. I can tell the difference, like some of the reviewers mentioned, it doesn't completely get rid of a scar (nothing does) but it did what it was supposed to, blend it in a a bit better. Newer scars seem to fade better than older ones. I would buy this again. I didn't quite know what to expect when I bought this. After reading instructions I gave it a shot, it burns somewhat but no worse then putting a liquid bandaid on. After a few days or so I noticed the top layer of my skin was starting to peel. Week and a half of using it every other day and my skin has peeled twice and returned to normal.Keeping scars out of the sun or at least protected from the sun is very important as well."
1,Did not work.,"This did not work for me. I tried it exactly how instructions showed and even though it made me break out more i stuck with it for months, in the end it just did not work. I had tons of little pimples all over my face worse than before."
5,Love It.,"I never ever had acne as a teen. Then something happened at age 28 (adult acne) and the past 3 years have been horrible for the skin on my face. I have oily skin apparently and after just 1 application of this my skin dried out tremendously. The texture also appeared different right away, I will use this once a week for a month and I have a feeling I will see good results. Beware this peel does burn like fire. I am an experienced peeler and this one hurt from the second I put in on. I lasted 2 minutes in front of an open window with cold air blowing in. Start slow because this stuff is no joke. I did not actually 'peel' either.Good Luck."
2,Ive tried a lot of products,Ive tried a lot of products and this one didnt really work for me... I read other peoples reviews and was excited but didnt clear up much and I stop using it
3,Really dried out my skin.,"I have been using this peel for a few weeks now hoping for great results like I read in the reviews. I'm not sure why, but this peel REALLY dries out my skin - just on the bottom have (jaw, lower cheek). I have very oily skin, so this was unexpected. I followed the directions and left it on for less than a minute each time, but still ended up w/ several brown patches of very dry, scabby skin. Then two days later I start to peel severely and this lasts a few days. I'm sure it's a great product, I just haven't had good results. It did, however, reduce oil and blackheads. I'm going to try it in combination w/ the Lactic Acid 50% peel as recommended and see how that goes."
2,Ouch,"I got this product thinking it would help with my adult acne. However, after months of using it, feeling the burn and never seeing any results in reduction of pimples after using up the entire bottle, I decided not to purchase anymore. Didn't work for me."
1,not for me,"I really wanted this to work for my skin- combination skin with tiny pimples in the TZone plus occasional large zits. I applied it regularly (as instructed) for almost 3 months. I was hoping it would eliminate my tiny pimples, reduce breakouts of the larger zit and even my skin tone. This is what happened to me:1. Yes, I felt like I built up a tolerance2. Yes, I experienced initial redness3. Yes, I experienced peeling a few days later4. No, I did not find my skin tone evening out or my acne clearing up. if anything, this seemed to completely confuse my skin, throwing it completely out of wack and triggering more breakouts.What did work- sticking with a gentle routine of cleaning with a mild ph cleaner and applying an oilfree lotion with 2% salicylic acid. If anything, I might apply this on a larger zit, but beyond that, I don't think this is the best thing for my entire face. I think the acid in this is even higher than the wart remover Compund W!"
2,Not So Happy,"So, It's been about a month I've been using this product and I haven't noticed any noticeable results in fact last week I left it for around 5 minutes on my face and my hyper pigmentation turned darker. So frustrated right now."
1,Confused after all these raving reviews,"It's hard to find a product nowadays that receives such high reviews, especially when the product is inexpensive and deals with a sensitive issue (appearance).After reading the reviews here on Amazon and researching Salicyclic Acid 20% on the internet, the believeable consensus is that this peel works very well. I was completely sold.After receving the product I tried it for the recommended time with nothing during, nor days after, the application.Frustrated, I left the peel on my skin the next application for over half an hour with no response. No redness, tingling, peeling, nothing- and obviously no results.I am kind of in shock about how this product, if anything, isn't for beginners, but for me is like putting water on my skin.While I am dumbfounded, the product did absolutely nothing for me, not even negative things.Who knows, maybe I have skin as tough as nails."
3,too strong for my skin,use this if your skin can handle the burn. I literally left it on for 2-3 min and burned my face. Maybe i'm just too sensitive so i don't recommend it for eveyone. caused alot of peeling and dryness.
4,GOOD FOR ACNE,"I bought this item to use as a mild chemical peel, but happily discovered that it works well in controlling new acne breakout."
4,works but stings like heck,I would recommend this product because after the dry skin went back to normal I noticed the marks got extremely lighter but the process of putting this on your skin Im not too thrilled about but that has nothing to do with the buyer.
1,Didn't work for me,"I have fair, sensitive skin and this product has done nothing. In reviews people spoke of heavy peeling and nice skin tone after a while. I got 0 peeling and no change in skin. I left the product on for 10 mins, felt a little stinging and had a little redness using it but after about an hour the redness would fade."
4,Pretty Good,"I have moderate acne and I get big scars easily. I'm a black woman with tan/brown skin. I get really dark spots left from the acne. I just received my bottle Friday and tried it two times. The first time I used a cotton ball and it was very little burning so I left it on for 10 minutes. I didn't really see any results. I tried again the following Tuesday and I had received my brush that I ordered. I used it instead and I felt a major difference. It began burning immediately. I was able to distract myself for 10 minutes. I didn't get red but I didn see the white spots that others spoke about. I used the neutralizer and my skin was so smooth. I also noticed that I only had a shinny nose where my entire face is usually oily. I think if I keep using it twice a week, I will see more results and the bumps will completely clear. I'm satisfied. I will change my rating to a 5 if I'm able to use Amby on my dark spots without reoccuring break outs."
4,FABULOUS!!!,"I have issues with eczema on my arms and face and after paying LOADS of money to a worthless dermatologist and equally worthless prescriptions, I found this product.I first used it in a few spots on my face (nose, cheek) where I was having small mini breakouts. A minute or two with it on, I was shocked to look into the mirror and see all kinds of major GUNK coming out of my pores. It was as if the product hit the ""evacuate"" button and all hands were on deck to help with the purging :PThe next spot was my arm. When I previously went with the dermatologist, it took honestly at least a year to see the SLIGHTEST improvement in my skin with my arms being the toughest spots. 4 minutes with this product on left my arm feeling much smoother. It will be a spot that will need repeat applications for sure but I was very encouraged by all results so far.WARNING:This is a wonderful product but like everything else in life, it's not idiot proof. Read the directions!!!"
3,still undecided,the first time i used this it burned so bad i could only handle seconds to a minute then i was scared the next day my face would be red and looked burned but it was fine the next week i tried it and it still burned i think its slowly getting better im not using it more then 1 or 2 a week just on bad spots im hoping this will work for my acne but as of right now i still havent found that amazing product
2,Not impressed...,"I've been using this product for 5-weeks. Honestly, my skin looks the same. The only time I had any peeling was when I got a little peel happy and applied Alpha Hydroxy on off days. YES! I know. Not everyone will experience peeling all the time, and not that I really wanted that. I just wanted...something. Granted, I only spent $18.95. I should have known better. Bah."
1,Blah...,"My son and I both have used this peel many times, and it really didn't seem to make much of a difference for either of us. Used over 2 mos, and no real change. Definitely will not buy again. Unlike the peels purchased and used by Skin Obsession, this just wasn't worth the time or money."
1,"Now, I have about 4 different black spots all around my face.","This product completely burnt my skin and left me with 4 different black scars here and there.Now, I might have to go for a laser treatment to recover my skin color.Worst product ever used.[...]"
2,Didn't work for me!,"After reading all kinds of glowing reviews for this product, I was eager to try it! I followed the instructions carefully, using it about once a week and starting with just one minute of time on my skin, and gradually working my way up to about 7 minutes.I have some minor acne, and a problem with clogged pores, but unfortunately this product did not seem to clear my skin at all, even after several months of use.PROS: Very clear instructions, cheap enough that even though it didn't work for me, I don't feel like I got ripped off!CONS: BURNS when you rinse it off, causes some redness, and DIDN'T clear my acne.Bottom line - it didn't work for me, but it was worth a try!"
2,Be Careful with this,"I used this product exactly as instructed when it came. I used for about a month with applications every 4 days. I Liked the effects from the initial couple of peels. Then like others I broke out with painful cystic acne after the 3rd peel. I wanted to muscle through this period reading that this will clear up eventually and I would have pushed through this period, however, I ended up having a disturbing side effect from this peel. Now, not only do I have acne scars, acne and clogged poors on the left side of my face (this is my only problem area for some reason) I now have a white spot of discoloration. I beleive this occured b/c I went into the sun a few days after a peel for only about 10 mins without sun block. I felt it wasn't worth the side effects to continue. I'm not sure when this discoloration will get back to normal, but it's been 2 months and I think it will be here to stay :("
4,SALICYLIC ACID PEEL - JURY STILL OUT,"Bought this peel to see if it would remove or reduce sun spots on my facial cheeks. I have been using the OTC spot remover with some success but it takes continuous use of 30 or more days. I've only used this item once so the jury is still out. However, at the first try, I felt a burning sensation right after application. I'd suggest following the guidelines as suggested in the directions: not leave on for more than 8 minutes although I think that would be much too long a time. I removed it within 1 minute of application which required lots of rinsing off with water and followed with a soothing face cream."
2,eh' its okay.,"I went to school for Esthetics so I have been subjected to ""the real deal"" I felt as though my skin looked/felt great the very next day but through-out the week there was nothing. Usually with peels your skin gets better day by day.I probably wont purchase this particular peel again unless I go for a higher level."
4,It works,"I been using this product weekly and so far so good, I am seeing improvement. Iam using this product with ROC night time repair works great!!"
3,I'm undecided,"I've been using it for about 3 weeks now. I haven't noticed anything dramatically different. I use it about 3 times a week and leave the product on about 5 minutes each time. I noticed some peeling on the left cheek and a lot of peeling on the right. Its work well on new white heads, but does not do anything for cystic pimples. Its just dries the top layer of the skin but the cystic pimple is still underneath.I may have spread it too close to my lip and nar my chin that it burned those parts and left some scarring.My old scars are still dark and very visible."
2,Didn't work for me :(,"I have combination oily & dry skin & I used this product 3-4x/week starting the 3rd week & used it regularly for almost 6 weeks & didn't really see any results. Had to stop when I moved because the new place has almost 0 humidity & this peel made my skin super dry. But my main complaint is that unfortunately for me, it didn't seem to have made much of a difference after 5 weeks. But then again, other products haven't really worked either, so I think it may be a hormonal issue & I'm trying birth control pills to see if they will help control my crazy hormone imbalance (my acne actually got worse now in my 20s). I may try it again whenever I visit friends & family in humid areas just to see if it'll work later, or just to maintain my skin when it's finally clear."
3,salicylic acid/gel peel,"Ive used this twice a day, faithfully. I've had it maybe 3 weeks now so I really can't give it 5 stars as of yet. I see on my skin, as far as the sun spots go, just a little bit of improvement. Not much yet though. Oh, how I want this to work on me! I've heard very good things of this product. The cost certainly is a great value. When it has done what it says it is supposed to, I WILL be singing its praises! I will be excited to write a review that would be worth 10 stars to me. I've even taken the ""before"" pictures. Then I'll do the ""during"" and hopefully the final ""after"" pictures. Wish me Luck, Guys! Thanks!"
1,One star is still too much,"This product gave me horrible, cystic, swollen painful deep acne breakouts. In addition to loads of tiny pimples all over. Don't know if its Salicylic acid itself or if its the company's formulation. Either way, will not use this again, and won't even take the chance of buying anything from this brand."
2,Not impressed with acne claims,"I don't have sensitive skin and had no problem tolerating the product, but I didn't see any difference with my acne. My pores may be smaller now, but it's hard to tell. I wouldn't purchase it again."
2,"""Peel"" is the Keyword.","I read all the reviews and a lot of professional sites that all said this was a great product and the recovery time would be negligible. I read several that said the title of ""Peel"" was facetious as most people don't actually notice any skin peeling; others said that the skin would peel the first 48 hours and then look so much better.I'm here at day seven and my face is still peeling. It seems as though I've lost four layers of dermis. I followed the directions explicitly, and only left it on for a little over a minute. I've never had a problem with dry skin or excessive peeling outside of sun damage. After using this product, my face feels tight and dry no matter how much moisturizer I use.I'm still hoping for that glow everyone is talking about, but at this point my hope is dwindling. I'm glad this product has worked so well for others, but for me it seems to be a bust."
4,Immediate gratification,"Arrived on my doorstep in a padded envelope embedded within another envelope. I've been wanting to use a facial peel for so long to combat sun damage, MANY acne scars,current acne, and general dullness.After reading the instructions, I wiped down with alcohol and used a gauze pad to apply the peel all over my face for a minute. It stung a little but was totally bearable and not bad at all. After a minute, I rinsed with cold water and you could actually see little flakes of skin.Immediately I had glowing skin - it definitely faded some very light scarring on my cheeks. The larger and more defined scars, however are still visible and hasn't changed much at all. Throughout the day you can see subtle patches of skin peeling off. So don't expect a drastic change at once, but I'm sure with continued and controlled use my scars will look much better.Definitely a buy. I plan on using this once a week. I'm already super happy with this product. CHYEA!"
4,Wow,"It has really helped to clear up my skin. I started to get ""adult acne"" and it seemed impossible to get off my face. I started to freak out that's when I ordered and it has really, really helped. Not vain..just not use to marks being on my face. This helped"
3,I'm not blown away.,"It definitely burns so I never leave it on for longer than a minute and a half, but I'm definitely not blown away by the results. I notice a glow to my skin afterwards, but it's nothing permanent. It also doesn't help my blemishes which is why I bought it."
1,Waste of money,I suffer from mild acne and I have brown spots. I used this product for approximately 2 weeks. It burns and it did nothing for my skin.
5,Not doing anything,Okay so i have acne holes and dark brown spots from it.Im tan; hispanic not dark at all and not light just tan =)well i always wash my face with neutrogena salicylic acidand i haven't really seen any difference..I've done chemical peels before and those actually made my skin peelwhich i love to see bc it means it works!i havent notice any peeling though =(i do see my skin is a light tighter..i have used it 3 times but ill keep tryingin a month i might try to switch to the gylic or whatever u call itsince my skin prob isn't sensitive
4,O.K,I don't really use this as a peel. I apply lightly to breakouts. I still got my acne but this really helped to dry them off a little. Not perfect but just O.K.
5,great for acne and fine lines,used on my oldest daughter acne it works very well.I also used it for fine lines works nicely with the glycolic acid would recommend using the both a day apart or so.
2,MRSAnonymous,It would have work if it didn't cause me to breakout all over my face. At fist I thought it was just normal breakout. A couple here and there then by the second week I had pimples all over my face which I never had. I decided to discontinue using it and my face started to clear. I had such high hope for this product.
3,I guess it's working,"I decided to try this product. I am starting to see the wrinkles and fine lines. I definitely felt the stinging/burning sensation the first time I tried it. I could only keep it on for 1 minute. I've been doing this treatment for a few weeks now, once a week. I'm not sure if I see the difference, but my co-worker said my face looked different. After using the product a few more times, I can tolerate the stinging for longer now, I'm up to 3-4 minutes now. I haven't had any recent acne break-outs so I am assuming this is a contributing factor."
1,NOT WORKING!!!!!!!!!,"I didn't place this review since I needed to see if I'll see result soon. So, after almost four weeks, using this product as directed, NO RESULT FOUND YET, except it bursn when you apply it ! I would not recomment this product to anyone at all, another money making ""quick"" solution for flawless skin? NOT happy!"
2,I'm stil waiting...,"Have been using this weekly for the past month on my daughter who suffers from back acne with sevre scaring. On first application she felt no stinging and did not peel (left it on for 7 minutes). Did a follow-up days later and while I noticed some frosting on her back - she still has not peeled and she started breaking out more. Sheesh!While it's working for some...definitely did not work for us. I received the instructions and followed them to the tee (cleaned her back, wiped down with alcohol, applied the peel, rinsed with cold water and applied a liquid skin neutralizer, moisturizer and sun screen). Absolutely nothing! Very disappointed..."
5,great inprovement in severe teen cystic acne,I got this for my son age 13. Tried everything else on market including expensive brands to no success. This made a noticible difference after only a few days. And noticible lifting the severe scars after a month or so. Now he only uses it for spot treatment.
5,Perfect,"I used to work at a spa and they would use this and charge you $65 per peel!! I buy this at home and my husband who is acne prone loves the immediate results. It won't cure your acne completely but it helps to control breakouts! I have pretty good skim skin and i use this once in awhile for a deep cleanse and my skin comes out nice and clean. Happy with the product, shipping time and price!!! :)"
5,Re's,YES it works but it burns like satan was in it. After 2 weeks my skin got scaly so 1 day I steamed some water and let my face just sit near the steam & suddenly the dead skin started peeling off and there was new smooth pretty skin. I am ordering some more when I use this.IT WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!
1,NOTHING...,"I bought this product to help even out some redness and solve mild acne. NOTHING...it burned a little after being on for 15 minutes, but once I rinsed I couldn't tell any difference in my skin, nor could I after 2 weeks of using this product every other day! What a scam!"
1,i am not going to recommend this product for my friends,I tried this product for four times. It really ruined my skin. This is the worst product i have ever bought. i hope my person experience can help you deeply think before you attempt to buy this product.
1,medo,"Is Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel save for pregnant women??I used it 3 times with Neutralizer skin pH balancer and Iam pregnant in the first month, now I am freaking out"
4,Great Acne Relief,"I have struggled with acne for several years and tried just about everything. This product gets it under control. After I use it, any blemishes that I have heal much quicker and leave less scarring. I haven't noticed a whole lot of difference in my pore size/black heads, but I have been using this peel for several months now and I am excited to move up to the 30%. As soon as I'm done using it, my skin it much softer and there is usually minimal visible peeling. Definitely worth a try if you suffer from acne. I only wish that there were a natural alternative that produced these results."
1,Product has left me with scarring.,"I was very excited about trying this product (I'm in my mid twenties and am starting to notice early signs of aging skin, despite taking good care of my face and staying out of the sun). Unfortunately, after using the product a second time, I developed red, bumpy skin around my chin that still has not gone away (it's been seven weeks as of today, Nov 30).UPDATE Feb 5th 2013: It's now been several months since I used this product, and the scarring has not faded. Please see my customer photos for reference."
4,Feel it,U can feel it work it burns.works pretty well.using it as spot treatment instead of a mask seems more pratical and works better for me.
5,Helpful,Seems to be helping and I love the fact that it isn't white colored (like the kind you buy in the local drugstore!)
1,....Jennifer doesn't make good music anymore,"Why is she trying to do this 'deep, soulful R&B' thing? She needs to stick to pop and hip hop, those are what she's good at. She doesn't have the voice or the talent for R&B. This is such [...]. Her newest single ""Get Right"" is also horrible, which is a bad sign-her last album had at least one good track, but 'Rebirth' might completely [...]. Buh-bye, J. Lo!"
3,baby... i don't really need you,Im a big JLO fan but this release is weak.first this single was released in the UK because fans asked forit and Sony pleased them (us) BUT all the content we the fans already have all this1. the album version ON THE THIS IS ME ALBUM2. r kelly remix ON THE REEL ME DVD/EP3. the video ON THE REEL ME DVD/EPI mean i love to collect all JLos things BUT could`vebeen great to have a B side or a new mix but as i told was only released due to fans purposes.
4,"Deep, solid reading, covering a complete range of ideas.","This work shines light on several icons of African thought, who are usually quoted more than they are read. By drawing from sources as diverse as Cabral and Wiredu, he has given a powerful tool to researchers, and has made it possible for students to learn what thinkers have said, not just what critics feel. This is a unique anthology, and would be a great starting point for any serious work on thought by Africans or people of African descent. This work is not burdened with much contextual analysis of the works, and this reveals the power in many of these works. Several of these authors are deceased or available only after critical analysis, and it is valuable to read their own words . A long read, but one that warrants time and attention. A phenomenal work."
3,625 mg krill...strong smell,"Not sure if I will get this brand again....I like that it is 625mg a pill, but it has a strong smell (kind reminds me of fish food) and it also has some other things such as vit B6 & B12 included, I am really just interested in the Krill."
1,very questionable quality..,"Thought I was cleverly saving a few bucks buying this over the Schiff product I used prior to this, but this is of VERY questionable quality to my senses...so much so in fact that I don't even trust this product enough to try ingesting even one of these into my body. Product is strongly foul-smelling upon opening bottle, enough so that it makes me question the quality of the oil inside. Additionally, gel caps are all oily EXTERNALLY, which they obviously should not be, which makes me question production quality of this product even more. Never had these problems with other krill or fish oils tried before. Should have known better, as twinlab is notorious for selling one-off quality products at one-off level prices...and I suppose there is a big enough customer base for them to thrive on...but to me that doesn't really equal good value since their products are clearly inferior the overwhelming majority of the time. Mine went right in the trash.."
4,PANTEON ROCOCO/ COMPANEROS MUSICALES,"Esta banda de ska nos presenta su produccion: companeros musicales, bajo la produccion de flavio oscar lusifidis gabras,este disco se lo recomiendo a toda la banda que le gusta de corazon el ska, y a los nuevos adeptos tambien, y para toda la banda que ya se canso de esperar por un nuevo disco de Maldita vecindad, panteon rococo retoma el camino que Maldita vecindad, al parecer abandono, y vaya que esta banda lo supo tomar y bastante bien, canciones que plantean los temas sociales y politicos, nos presentan la realidad que se vive en latinoamerica,como: La carencia,seguir bailando, globalizado, son algunos de los temas, con los que esta banda demuestra su fuerte potencial para quedarse como una de las favoritas, en este genero musical."
3,Good but not Ultimate,"I'm a real house and club music junkie. I'm 44 years old and live in NYC. I used to go to all the underground clubs to hear the latest house and club mixes. I was a member of the Paradise Garage and I've been hounding real, classic house and club tunes for all of my adult life. I saw some tunes on the CD that I only had on tape (yes, cassettes) so I thought I would give it a try. The mixes were average, maybe even weak on a couple songs. The selection was okay. Outside of the specific tunes I was looking for the rest were just okay. Overall, I liked the CD but Ultimate doesn't begin to describe the mixes or the selection. Overall, I'd say it's decent to good but not great or Ultimate."
3,It could be better,The dj attemps to bring together good cuts with radio jams and it should be separate. Wish Doctor and Perculator and not in the same league as the others. House or club should have a deep trance like section separate from the regulra club radio version.
1,Chi-town house expert,"If this crap is what NY considers house music then i see why the Knicks couldn't beat the bulls back in the day:) If this is house then R.Kelly likes women over 30, come on this is trash, although Nu-Nu by Lidell was banging back in the day"
3,not what i expected,"This CD was not at all what i expected from Bad Boy Joe. Its old ****, not appealing, and the songs carry on for far too long. Honostly it bores me to death. that stuff is in the past. Nothing at all special, LAME!!Bad boy Joe is not what he is cracked up to be."
5,"The One and Only ""Skacid"" track in the world!","This is absolutely a unique 12""! The combination of Ska and Acid has never been fusioned on vinyl, but this is the one! The experimental ""This is Ska!"" was, as far as i know, a one hit-and one band-wonder, and a follow-up to this interesting style has nexer been done. It is from around 1992, the younger days of acid-house where everything was possible! The B-side contains an energetic old-school house track which both primitive AND beautiful! Highly recommandable for the real feinschmekker! Long live SKACID!"
5,What I like about Working Cures,"Excellent information about healing, herbs, and African American midwives in the antebellum period. Highly recommended for readers interested in health, birthing, and midwives in the African American community during that time. Unexpectedly, also great art!"
5,One of the Most Entertaining Show I've seen,Where is Season 2 on Amazon? I absolutely Loved the first season of Rob's Fantasy Factory. He knows how to entertain with every episode and he is funny as Heck. You don't need to be a Teenager to enjoy this show. Rob Dyrdek is 36 right now and he finished doing season 3. This show is for all ages and anyone who has a great sense of humor and wants to watch a fun show.
2,I am David review by Sunhoo Park,"I am David is a book about a twelve year old boy who has never been out of concentration camp. A man at the camp helps him escape and provides a bundle of items for him. In the bundle, he has a compass, piece of bread and some advice to go to Denmark. He then makes his way from Bulgaria all the way to Denmark. On his way there, he meets many obstacles that slow him down. Also, on his way there, he does many things for his God. He saves a little girl. Then, he meets a Danish painter who knows his mother. Later on, he meets his mother.What I disliked about this book is that there are too many unbelivable things. Firstly, how in the world does he find his mother. Secondly, what are the chances of the painter being Danish. Thirdly, how does he survive a winter in a barn.I recomend this book to people who like adventures."
3,This book could be summed up ALL of it on one page i sware,well what can i say about this book i guess i didnt like the idea of it cause i had to read it for school.During to holidays too so what didnt make it any better i guess there is worse books but this one was really easy to right questions about as it is a simple story that i sware could be summed up in one page but other then that i guess it wasnt that bad it draged on a bit and it was really easy to tell what happened at the end!!!
1,not a good book,"this book is a very boring book. I read this book because it wuz in my home library thinking it was a good book since it was made into a movie. I was wrong. This book almost put me to sleep. I wanted to get in the habit of reading more often and this book was the only choice i had. I just finished reading the book and would never pick this book up again. Don't buy this book if you are over the age 13, since i am. If you are in the rage of 8-12, this book might be interesting to you. Teens, i do not recommend this book for you, it is boring."
2,This book was O.K.,I have read much better books before. This book was not very exciting. I wouldn't recomend it.
5,"Very good book, very educational about europe at the time.","Wow what a good book! i just finished reading this book called i am David, about this 12 year old biy who has grown up in a concentration camp. i gave this story 5 stars because the author did an excellent job of describing David's character. i recommend this book to all readers from the age of 10+. ity was a really powerful story and i enjoyed every part of it."
5,A Read Through,"I Am David shows the horror of a country without freedom and what living in a country that holds no love for freedom for all men, shows what is done to men and children ""they"" find subversive. David is a special child given the strength to trek through difficulities and the unknown looking for what he knows in his heart to be something ""lost"" and so much better. Even though this is a book aimed for the primary younger crowd, this grandma couldn't put the book down until young David experienced the bad and good from those that journeyed with him in his search."
2,Advanced?,"If you are just getting on Vegas, this will make a very simple and basic companion. Much more depth is needed, and could have been added - there was so much time left on the DVD. I figured this all out already via the manual."
3,not a light feather,"This isn't a novel at least to me it doesn't read like one, it reads like a diary.There are too many things in it that don't connect with anything else and left me wondering why they were there in the first place."
3,Keep expectations reasonable,"""mrphil"" complains that the sink he bought ""Came missing Strainers,Faucet,Mounting Bolts."" However, these items are not normally included with any sink. More to the point, they're not shown in the photo or mentioned in the product description of this item. It sounds as if this buyer had unrealistic expections, and when they weren't met, decided to take it out on the seller with a low rating."
5,Cheap and Durable!!,"Cheap and Durable!! Two words that usually don't go together in the RC hobby world. I have used these RD logics tools for about 4 years now. I have never had any issues with these stripping or breaking the tips. I am very pleased with these tools, and you can't beat the price. Same quality as much higher priced sets."
4,Excellent historical film on rebirth of current Olympics.,"This movie depicts how the current Olympics were renewed. It encompasses the trials and tribulations of getting atheletes from various natons, how they were trained and how they faired at the 1896 Olympics. Told with humor and suspense this is a ""must have"" for anyone who enjoys the Olympics. Filmed in part in Athens, the the beauty of the sites and the marvelous sound track only enhance this film. Parts will have you cheering, smiling, blushing and crying. It always brings me goosebumps whenever I see this film. Enjoy!"
3,Chariots of desire.,"If you have 280 minutes to spare, this is an engaging and enjoyable account of the first modern Olympic games, held in Athens in 1896. At such a length, one might expect a tedious documentary approach, but instead we get a nicely-paced story of privileged young men enjoying some pure athletic rivalry and old-fashioned male bonding. This film manages to avoid Chariots of Fire's melodramatic themes while still delivering an exciting depiction of those first Olympic games, where athletes competed because of their simple desire for greatness."
3,History Fiction,This miniseries was an interesting preview of how the modern Olympics came into being. It also provides a contrasting framework of how our Olympic teams were formed and funded at the beginning to how it is today.
3,Unexceptable editors cuts,"""The First Olympics: Athens 1896"" has been one of our favorite movies since it first came out in 84. We got the DVD version and like it just fine but have noticed that there are a few small (but, to us, essential) parts missing. It is a very long movie and is, perhaps, understandable that they would want to shorten it a bit. If you have never seen the original version, you are not likely to miss the parts that have been cut. I would still recommend the movie. We were, none-the-less, somewhat disappointed."
5,Love this movir!,"Please, DVD it !!!! I remember seeing this movie in high school, and thought it depicted the times well."
1,DVD useless,"Can't watch the DVD on my DVD-device, he doesn't start up so I bought something I have no pleasure of watching it.Have ordered more DVD's in the past and I could all watch them on my DVD-player but this one not.I am not pleased at all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Costs more to send it back so it goes into the trashcan ."
5,the first olympics athens 1896,I had seen the film on TV several years ago and had been looking for a dvd for some time. I enjoyed it and will keep on enjoying it for years to come.
5,Highly recommended,I watched this when it first aired and thought it was wonderful. With the Olympics coming up again I happily bought this to share with the whole family. Everybody loved it.
3,Nice Resource,"This is a nice basic resource on coporate culture/organizational culture. Althought the text is now outdated, it provides a fundamental view of the title topic."
2,soloarma,I wontyou to sent me a books about information technology.iwont you to post it for me on this addresssolomon Armahbox os 647osu accrawest africa.
5,20th century jewel,"For my money, this short classic is the best explanation to the western reader of what Zen is about. Herrigel, a German, and his wife lived in Japan for five years and learned Zen through the practices of Archery and Flower Arranging, respectively. This fascinating account of Zen teaching at work (with a difficult learner) illumines the depths of the matter as well as any printed words can; plus, it's an entertaining true story. I especially like the part where the Master determines to try to see the westerner's point of view in order to help his pupil learn, so he gets a book of German philosophers, but gives up in disgust, noting that it's no wonder the man who concerns himself with such things can't shoot an arrow straight!"
3,An Introduction,Although Herrigel's work is not the most brilliant writing his message still stands. This is a very brief work and easy to read. The message is very universal and reflects the committment necessary to fulfill just about anything worth striving for. You will read one man's example of what it took for him to understand Zen. This story is told through the characters experience learning archery. This may help you decide if it is an appropriate journey for yourself or if it compares with the journey you have been on.
1,Zen in the Art of Archery,"This was not the book that I was interested in.While this described a process and philosophy, I wanted the original book that told the story of the student and archery master.Very disappointing."
1,Read with a grain of salt,"In ""Zen Combat"" author Jay Gluck states that Herrigel went on to become a fervent Nazi. If true (I lack the inclination to research this), it speaks poorly of the quality of his kyudo instruction. Decide for yourself."
2,No use for the practicing archer.,"I found this book to be a wonderful story of one man's spiritual quest. However in repect to archery and it's techniques, the book was totally useless."
5,Awesome,"Happy customer. Would use this vendor again!! Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, and yep"
4,Good story-poorly written,"I thought this was an incredible story and I enjoyed it thoroughly. And it gives me one more reason to be thankful that I live in the United States. However, not being a critic for writing skills, I did think this book was poorly written. Sometimes I would read a sentence and think, ""huh?"" And it didn't necessarily flow all that well either. At one point she was talking about something that happened when she was 18 and then shortly thereafter, she was 16 years old. But again, it was an interesting story."
1,Boring Beyond Belief,"There is nothing ""gripping"" about this book. The beginning of the book, the tale of life with the King, is interesting. Once the family is arrested and incarcerated, it becomes boring beyond belief - and this is the part of the book that should be riveting! Instead, I found the narration totally self-centered and the ""story"" absolutely colorless. I quit reading about page 138 (just after the escape) because at that point I could have cared less what happened to this family. The travesty is that these events were real and I should feel outrage and compassion for this family. Instead, I'm annoyed I spent money on this horribly written/edited/translated book!"
2,Twice stolen,"It takes more than surviving a harrowing experience to inspire a good book. The situation this family endured deserves better treatment than it gets here. Malika Oufkir's view of the social and political scene, which could have offered brilliant insight into a world hidden from our view, was that of a naive and uneducated teenager: uninformed and self-centered. Perhaps this is the result of being imprisoned in a desert for 20 years. Besides its disappointingly limited scope, an inept author was chosen to collaborate on this project. The writing of this first-person narrative was trite. Instead of being captivated by this family's plight, I found myself playing a distracting game of count-the-cliches, with at least one on every page. Good books combine a fascinating story and brilliant command of the written word. Neither element is evident here."
1,And ?,"The only pertinent question being :Who cares ?If the adopted ""Royal"" family needs to make a few bucks these days, ever heard of a job ?"
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!,This is one of the most compelling books I have ever read and I am a voracious reader. You live the story right along with the family and it really captures your emotions. It was with GREAT sadness that I finished this book. It was written with such style that I felt like I was a part of the story. I recommend this book highly to all!
3,Who edited this book?,"I won't go into too much detail but must agree with those who thought that the story had potential but the book was poorly written and edited. But I can't honestly blame the writer. Millions of poorly written books are submitted to publishing houses each year. It was up to the editor and publisher to really go to town on this book. It's possible they improved it from really bad to ok to print, but like other reviewers, i could hardly get through this for my book club. I felt like i was reading the diary of a middle school aged girl! Furthermore, Oufkir is clearly repressed or supressing her own feelings. Her explorations of her feelings were surface at best. I didn't feel any depth of emotion on her part, whatsoever. She also comes off sounding smug and superior, when I imagine she may not be that way in real life.Had this not been for my book club, and had i not had integrity to finish it so i could fully trash it at book club, i would not have gotten past page 35."
3,"It is poorly written, but it is still interesting","I was a bit confused in parts of the book and sometimes bored. I felt like I really never knew the people in the book, especially Malika, but it was still a very interesting book, just not told very well. The book had such potential. It was a lot or boring descriptions of her encourters with the King and her relatives, but I really did not ""feel"" her anger, her pain, her happiness. A lot of the time, I was confused! I felt like reading it was chore, but I am glad I read it. I feel a new sense of family and determination in difficult situations (no where near as difficult as Malika's though). I would give the book a five, if it was not soooo poorly written."
5,Outstanding,This is a very well-written account of a fascinating life. The story really stuck in my head. To live through such torture and still be able to have a positive outlook is remarkable. Somehow they managed to write this in such a way that it does not have any overtone of self-pity. I've recommended this to several friends who have also enjoyed it very much. It helped me renew my sense of how blessed I am to live in this country.
5,Injustice in Morroco,"Oprah's selection of STOLEN LIVES allowed great injustices to be exposed. Malika Oufkir, once an adopted child of the King of Morroco, found herself thrown in prison because of political acts she had nothing to do with. She describes the horrors she was forced to endure. Fortunately, she found freedom and the courage to tell this story."
2,Engrossing story worthy of notice--but horribly written,"I honestly didn't finish this book.When I purchased it, I just knew it would be the type of tale that would leave me horrified and full of indignation at the injustice.The story is definitely one that needs light shone on it, but the writing was SO awful that I simply could not continue to read the book.I'm not a terribly discerning reader. I love books of all kinds. I'm not one of those snobby literature geeks that can't bear to read a page-turner because it would just be too trite. Yet even I couldn't get through this book.This story really should be re-written by a better author."
2,"Interesting topic, not a great read","2.5What happened to Malika Oufkir and her family was absolutely horrendous. It's difficult for most 21st century minds to comprehend imprisoning families for the sins of the father (literally) and the 'prison' conditions described in the book. And this all happened a couple decades ago! The way this family persevered and survived, both physically and mentally, is uplifting. The stories that Malika would invent and tell her family comes to mind.Unfortunately, this book was not that well-written. In fact, I was bored several times during the long chapters leading up to the imprisonment. I think this story deserved much better."
4,heart renching veiw of what really happens in the wrold,"This book was a real eyeopener as to how the rest of the world, outside the united states, conducts their human affairs. It was a real look into the struggles for freedom and democracy and the consequences of fighting for them. Unfortunately this family was used as an example, of what could happen if one speaks out against government. Page turning"
3,Not a strong book,"While I found the plot of the book to be very engaging, I was disappointed with the writing. This is not a well-written book; perhaps some of the eloquence was lost in translation. Nevertheless, it is a good read if you can wade through the tedium of 20 years in prison."
2,It stole my life,A tragic story but one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. Too bad because it was a fascinating tale that fell far short of mediocrity.
3,Richer for the Experience,"As with many of Oprah's other picks, I wasn't too excited about reading this novel. However, upon finishing it, I was glad that I took the time to read it. The story is of the Oufkir family and how they were held prisoner by the Morrocan government after their father attempted to assinate King Hassan II. The conditions they endured for the twenty years they were held captive were horrendous. Yes, the story is a depressing one, but you can't help appreciate in the end,what this family endured and how the bonds of love can get people through the most trying of times. I found the novel was hard to get into initially, but give it a chance. It picks up toward the middle and becomes very engaging for the remainder. It will leave you feeling a little richer and a little more appreciative of your own life."
5,Amazing Story to be Told,This book was one of my all time favorites. The story the author tells keeps you on the edge of your seat--truly spine tingling. It's a book that provokes alot of soul-searching and inner questioning. What's life really about? How do people survive such things as those described in this book? A thought provoking book.
4,"7300 Days, .7 Lines A Day","After reading STOLEN LIVES, I was able to grasp (as much as is possible) what it must have been like for Oufkir and her family to live in the horrific prison conditions they did, but I wasn't able to grasp how long ""20 years"" of captivity is. So, I went back to the book. It's 294 pages long, which is approximately 10,800 lines of text (if every page is full). If I divide the text into .7 line segments and read one segment a day, it will take me 7300 days, or 20 years, to read the whole book. That is an excruciatingly long time, longer than I'd care to imagine."
4,Stolen Lives,"I found this story to be an inspirational account of a young girl's struggle from the palace to a jail cell. The orginial controversy of punnishing children for their father's actions developed the story into a thrilling drama. It was a compelling and gripping story, but they way it was written was a little off. Some of the sentances were difficult to read because of the way the words were written. I did not like how the writer kept jumping to the past and present to explain events. This made it confusing to determine what details were current and which already occured."
2,Just Could't Get Through It,"At first I was intrigued by the vivid descriptions of a palace life in a far-away land. Then, the details began to jump back and forth and all over the place. It seems that just when Ms. Oukfir would get to the next part of her story, she would remember something else from the previous part and go into a whole different direction, never returning to where she left off.It was getting me dizzy so I just put the book down. The story is worth telling, it's just too bad there wasn't a good editor."
2,Great Story...but,"It was a great story and it really gave insite to life in her country,but the story was often contridicting, her hair is gone and then...its back. The radio was ingenious, but no radio can last for 15 years. It could have been a great story, but unfortunatly it the writing ruined it for me."
2,Like a 5th Grade homework assignment,"She went through hell. Yes! She showed tremendous courage. Yes! But in the telling of this book the scenes, characters, events, timeline and happenings are jumbled up in a childlike rendition of a most difficult life in captivity. This book reminded me of a 5th graders reading assignment. Malika's focus is not so much more than ""am I still pretty"" while in her various jails. Some of the stoty makes no sense ( the hidden radio hookup between cells) along with many other events that are difficult to believe."
3,Good story but....,"It's a great story to write a book about, but the rhythm of the sentenses and structure are not smooth."
2,Shallow and Poorly Written,After living off and on in Morocco for 7 years in the 90's I'd never actually heard of the Oufkirs but I did hear much of the supposed royal excess. I was always taken the stories with a grain of salt. To see them recounted on the pages of this book was interesting to say the least.It's too bad that this is so poorly written because the story definitely deserves to be told....please someone tell it with a bit more depth.
3,Not what I expected,"Well, I was very excited to read this book & learn about Malika's imprisonment. I find it inspiring to read about people who have such courage & stength. The book didn't quite measure to my standards though. First, I felt the story could have been better told if it was told as a ""story"". It was to some extent, but not quite, because she was narrating and not just leting the story come about. Second, I guess it was just hard to feel a lot of pity for her, after reading about the hollocaust & other cases of more ""extreme"" punishment. Don't get me wrong, a great injustice was done & it's horrible, because these people are scarred forever. But especially the first few places they were held, wasn't quite like the prison I expected. It was more of a house arrest. Also, it did leave you hanging- why did her father start a coup?? It was an alright read. It was just hard to stay interested at a lot of points. However, I wish Malika & her family all of the justice & happiness they deserve."
4,Horrible Lives,"I read this book after seeing Malika on Oprah. I am not a book club reader, but received this from my son(8 years old) for Mother's Day. It was hard to get into this book at first, and it is very jumbled as it is told directly to a woman from Malika. It is obvious she is recalling experiences that were extremely painful. This has made me realize that we are very fortunate individuals in America, we live lives of freedom. I cannot imagine life as it was for the Oufkir family. They had stolen years, decades to make up for. What a tragedy, and horror to live with forever. I will pass this book along as it made me appreciate many little things I have taken for granted. It is a great book, horrible lives."
2,I Want to Believe,"I appreciated Malika Oufkir's book very much. I have to wonder though, with the reader from Olympia, Washington, about some of the information Oufkir includes. It somehow seems disconnected at times. I also wonder why her father, well-connected and wealthy, jeapordized his family's lives with his attempted coup. The writing, as well, seems ""rough"" at times. I am very interested in Morocco and have traveled there. I do have great sympathy for Oufkir; I just wish the book were better written and more clear in the details. The poor woman, though, was probably in a state of constant shock due to the terrible conditions, and her recall probably IS uncertain at times."
5,A fabulous and gripping read,This really was the best book I have read in a while. I was torn between not wanting to put the book down and not wanting to finish. I noticed that some reviewers had difficulty following the book - I didn't encounter those problems. I found it very easy to immerse myself in the fascinating and sometimes extremely difficult situations that Mmes Oufkir and Fitousi described.This book has forced me to think about what I value - it has challenged me to be more appreciative of all that I have.
4,Couldn't put it down!,Excellent book. At times it gets a little verbose in description but it is a phenomenol story.
3,what's the rest of the story?,I would have like to have seen more photos in the book...of anything to give more of a cultural feeling of Morrocco having never been there. I also thought the writing was a little cut and dried and many interesting facts were left out which could have made the writing richer and then at the end ...it just ended. I feel like I read half a book.
1,zzzzzzzzzzz,"ok here's the thing I am a middle eastern women, so I have heard lots of horryfying stories women in captivity and how they were treated like animals, their struggle to have freedom, education, jobs etc. .... this book is sooooooo boring, after 100 pages nothing was happening so i gave up. it took 100 pages for her to get to the fact that her family was relocated to a desert like hut I am not kidding, that long!!!i it is possible that it is a good story later, but honestly you have to pace the content of your story according and get to the real material."
5,Amazing Story of the Human Spirit!,"I have not done any research to verify if the information in this book is accurate or not. However, it was an excellent read and I highly recommend it! It provided an extraordinary glimpse into the world of human rights abuses and leaves the reader with a deep appreciation for the simple joys that we take for granted.Malika Oufkir was a teenager in the prime of her life when she was put into horrible prison conditions for twenty years with her family. Her family was being punished for the political actions of her father.Malika is an excellent story teller and has lives on the inside of the royal family in Morocco so it is very interesting to hear details of her upbringing.It is extraordinary to hear of the atrocious jail conditions inflicted on this family that was used to such a lavish existence. If you have any interest in human rights or the politics of Morocco then you will be fascinated by this read!"
1,Glad to be finished!,"I read this book for bookclub after hearing from many people how ""wonderful"" and ""inspiring"" it was. Now after just having finished it and knowing that I would be discussing it tonight, I was really concerned. What was wrong with me that the book annoyed me and seemed to me to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever managed to finish. It contained constant contradictions that caused me to begin to question the truth of everything else that was said. The complete disregard Malika showed for the plight of the two retainers who joined her family in prison leads me to see her as a selfish, self-entitled woman. And, did you know that she was the hero of everything? Her family wouldn't have survived without her - according to her. The book might have been better with a more skillful writer, but as it is, it doesn't measure up to the dramatic subject matter. I'm glad I read the reviews here to see that, at least I'm not the only one who feels this way."
4,Amazing True Story,"This was a great true story and it is amazing how the family finally did get out of the hell that they were condemn to. A friend of mine had recommended this book, telling me brief synopses. I was very intrigued by the story and in disbelief. I think what I found so interesting is that I never even known about this until I read the book! I don't remember anything on the news about this at all, when they were released in the 90s. Malika's story of bravery is incredible and almost too hard to even imagine such a transition (princess to prisoner)My only wish was that there was more about Malika's life after prison and with her family. I am eager to know how the family is healing after this ordeal...Fantastic Book!"
3,Amazing Tale of Human Will To Live,"The story of this book gripped me and I found myself being completely appalled by the fact that it was a real story. I couldn't put this book down and found myself searching for more information on Malika Oukfir on the internet.That being said, I did find the writing style of the this book very rudimentary and uninspired."
2,Lost Interest,"I read 55 pages & found myself unable to ""gel"" with the main character or any of the characters. Perhaps, there was too little dialogue in the first 50 pages to get a real feel for the characters."
5,This is True?? so hard to imagine,how they suffered. What a tragic tale but also what courage they all had. This is a must read for every one. I hope it will open our eyes to the pain and suffering of others in our world.Thanks Malika for sharing your touching story!
2,No Depth,"I could not get beyond the vanity and self-centeredness of Malika. I understand that she was locked up as a teenager, but the author needed to add depth to the historical events surrounding this event. Unfortunately, I could was not able to find a connection to the terribly spoiled girl who got locked up. Since I was unfamiliar with the history of the coupe, I was left wondering why the General would take action without taking steps to protect his family? Certainly he had the assets to do so."
3,Fascinating real life story but not worth buying.,"This book, a true story written by a now adult woman who was jailed as a young woman, is not recommended. The family seems to accept the politics of their country when it provides them with wealth, comforts, and power. It's difficult to feel sympathy when they are suddenly on the flip side of their politics and jailed-mainly I believe because the story is so poorly written. It never engages you or draws you into the story, so sympathy for the ""characters"" never develops. Undoubtedly a very powerful story but this book doesn't do it or their cause justice. My 3 star rating is out of respect for the story, the writing would receive 1."
4,Fascinating true story,I found this book mesmerizing. Malika's story is mindblowing. The most interesting parts of the book occured when I realized how the rest of the world just continued on as Malika's family suffered inhumane conditions for over 15 years! I agree that it could have been written better. The author often reveals information at inappropriate points in the story...
4,A Sad 20 Years,"This book really makes you realize how lucky we are to have our freedom. It starts out with Malika as a small chid who is adopted away from her parents by the king of Morrocco to be a playmate for his daughter. She lives the life of a princess and has everything she could ever want. Her father is accused of trying to kill the king and he is killed himself. Her mother and her brothers and sisters are imprisoned for the next 20 years for their Father's crimes. They are given very little to eat and live in horrible conditions with rats, scorpions and cockroaches. Malika finally decides to escape and beginsto dig her way out with a spoon. They finally escape and then try to live normally again after being locked up for 20 years. I really felt sorry for her youngest brother who went to prison when he was only 3 years old. He never knew any other life except for prison! This book is a must have for any collection."
2,wait for paperback,"vapid. very interesting material that falls flat. promising premise that never leads up to potential. take it out of the library, do not buy."
2,Slow,"This book, for me, was hard to get into. I read it for a book club. I just think that the style of the book was hard to follow."
4,Very good acting,"This is a Mexican film of the 1990's that did not make a lot of noise. It tells the typical story of a Mexican politician fallen to disgrace who loses everything, his assets, friends, family and finally his hotel. The acting is excellent as it is the script which was originally conceived for theater"
1,A case AGAINST public domain.,"Taking a classic film that has slipped into the public domain and converting it to book form is not illegal. This book is an example of why it should be. If you are a fan of NotLD and seeking a print version of the story, I suggest seeking out the version the films' originator, John Russo, produced.The writing is not exciting and even with the film almost committed to memory, the scenes do not come to life. This title smacked of an individual trying to make a buck off of something that is loved by millions. For anybody to take this film and convert it into book form seemed wrong on so many levels. For anybody to write the words ""They're coming to get you, Barbra..."" and include a copyright page in the front of their book just felt wrong.I have no familiarity with Mr. Andrews' other works, but this so-called ""Movie Tie-In"" (as it is noted on the spine of the book) has soured me in what may be a permanent way."
2,Just Watch the Movie,"I was hoping that we could glean more information about the characters in the book than what was in the movie, but alas, I was wrong. I've seen the movie many times and each time I find a little more social commentary than the last time I watched it. I guess that's the reason I bought the book, but I got very little new information from it before I finally gave up on it :("
3,crate mat,"This is nice material, soft and made well. My only real complaint is it is very thin and my dog needs to have more of a cusion to lay on. I would recommend to put over a cusion or use for a cover on couch for favorite place for a dog/cat to lay on."
2,Not really for children,"I'm a children's librarian, so I listen to and review a lot of children's music.Jessica Harper has a rich, clear voice. She avoids that saccharine, cute quality that is so often foisted off on children. The songs she sings are a combination of soft jazz and folk. The lyrics are clever and intelligent.However, Harper's music, in my professional experience, will impress the adult who buys it more than the child whom it is supposed to be for. Harper's music doesn't have the energy that appeals to children, and her subject matter doesn't connect with children. Her tapes and CDs don't get checked out of our library.A parent who has an exceptional child might coach the child into enjoying this album, but most children will be much happier with something by artists who have a natural talent for connecting with children. Try something from Peter, Paul, and Mary or Tom Chapin, instead."
5,One of the Best Romance Novels,This is one of the best romance novels this author has written. It is definitely worth a trip to the library.
5,Heavy duty,"Big and heavy, good for large flat screen. Easy to assemble and is adjustable to level it in an unleveled room. Would definitely recommend if you don't have the factory stand."
3,"Heavy and sturdy, but be prepared...","I had no idea the box arrived weighing over 50 lb. Luckily, the UPS guy pushed it through my front door and into the house, where it sat until I was able to round up a crew of helpers to put it together and attach the TV to it. It took 2 hours to do that - a long, long time. Now that it's finally assembled, I can say that it is a quality piece. One caveat: the back panel could not be fully attached because its screw holes don't fully line up with the holes on the main part of the stand. This was just put together tonight, so I'm not sure whether it's a manufacturing defect or the result of the way it was put together; could be either. But the stand is accomplishing its purpose, so that I could get the TV off the wallmount that never worked properly and onto a table that I can turn, allowing me finally to see a TV program while I'm on the computer, which is all the time."
3,The Flat Screen PSD TTS mount,"It is a nice piece of fixture but be aware it didnt come with all necessary screws, I had to go to my local hardware stor and uy necessary stuff so if you are looking for a DIY stay away from this one"
1,"An OK stand, but it's not universal.","The images in the product description suggest this would be a good stand -- simple clean lines. But it's far from universal: If your plasma TV is not perfectly flat all the way across the back side, then the stand's horizontal mounting bars won't work -- you can't attach your TV to this stand...!"
5,Bigger and Sturdier than expected,"Bought this to mount an older flat screen. This TV is VERY heavy. But this stand is VERY sturdy and well made. I was very comfortable mounting the 42"" with speakers on each side - probably weighs over 100 lbs. Even though the TV is a bit rounded in the back and not flat, the mounts did not have any problems. We did have to go get longer screws than were included b/c our TV had very deep mounting holes. All of the parts and pieces are easy to identify and directions are easy to follow. I assembled it myself in under 30 minutes."
2,"Great Stand, But needs more specific Info for what TV's it works with.","This stand is well made and looks great. However the arms the attach to the tv only fit certain TVs. If the bolt holes are more then 30"" apart then you need a different Arm Size that is available by a different part Number. This should be more clearly defined on the literature. Other then that no complaints."
5,"Great product, a little expensive","I have a 42"" flat screen that I didn't want to wall mount and this base works wonderfully with it. All the parts come organized and labeled and it's relatively easy to put together. My only complaint is that it is kind of on the expensive side, but it's a solid and sturdy piece of equipment so I guess it all evens out. I would definitely recommend this base to anyone who doesn't have the original base with their tv and doesn't want to wall mount it. Like I said, it's a little expensive, but there is nothing else out there to buy and it's a great product."
4,Great Mount,"The mount arrived sooner than expected and looks very classy, is solid and assembled very easily . The only down comment is on a 32"" screen the horizontal mounting bars stick out about an inch on either side. Not a big deal unless you want them completely hidden behind the TV."
4,"Overall, decent buy","I was a little worried this would not work with the plasma monitor I had recently purchased because it was not a TV. However, This worked perfectly! There were many different options to choose from to mount the monitor. I was very pleased with the shipping time and definitely pleased with the quality. The only reason I would give this a 4 star rating is because of the price. Where the material is quality, the product is geared to be highly profitable for the company. I would have been okay with something between $100-$120."
4,Premier Makes a Stand,"I found the Premier Mounts PSD-TTS/B Universal Tabletop Stand to be exactly as advertised. It is super heavy duty and good looking. The stand arrived in just a couple of days. The included assembly instructions were as clear as could be expected for a product that would mate with hundreds of TVs. The massive amount of included but easily identified assembly parts would have been daunting had it not been for the clever directions to home in on a particular series of TVs. The only reason I did not give this an overall product rating of 5 stars is because I thought the price was a little high when a complete component table with TV mount could be purchased for about the same money.WayneChantilly, VA"
3,Decent little Gundam,"One really cannot complain too much due to the price, but this Gundam is surprisingly basic considering how important this Gundam is. Without painting, it looks... plain. If you don't mind spending some time to paint a SD Gundam, it can look decent. I did a video review that gives a bit more details on the constructions and gimmicks: [....]"
3,"Jewwlers Saw - not a toy, a precision tool.","Bought this tool to cut copper wire coils into jumprings for chain maille jewelry. The tool is quality, much better than the old one I had and misplaced. (Freudian??) Anyway - it works well if you can find a way to hold the coil steady. The coil-holding plier I purchased to do this only holds about 3/4 of an inch of coil and if it is smaller than 16 gauge wire, the coil collapses when you grip it tight enough to do the cutting without the coil shifting under the saw. Anyway the saw is high quality."
5,God Whispers,"When God Whispers Your NameRate this at least ""10"". Read this and be all amazed when you learn how ""God Whispers"" your name and how you feel when it happens. God does know you and you have a better understanding after reading this book. Great gift. Max should be considered the ""Nora Roberts"" of the religious genre."
5,When God Whisper Your Name,I gave this book a 5 for a good reason. And the reason is that I like books that make me think about how and why I do the things I do in life. I also like that Max will put God lessons into everyday life
5,Loved it,This book opened up a whole new can of worms for me. I never thought alot on the Spirit. It's usually not taught much in CoC's. It was life changing.
5,Review of When God Whispers Your Name,"Max Lucado's writings are like a breath of fresh air. His method of storytelling and of sharing God's word is truly a gift -- one that he does an excellent job of using. I had read a few books of Lucado's before this one, so I had high hopes for this book. Thankfully, it did not disappoint. Few authors can capture my attention the way Lucado does; he is truly an inspiration and a joy to read, and I always find a great deal of profound wisdom from his books. It is always good to be reminded of God's love and purpose for mankind, and ""When God Whispers Your Name"" does just that. I wholeheartedly recommend Max Lucado's books, particularly this one, to others. You won't be disappointed!I received this book for free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as a part of their book review program. I was not required to write a positive review; my opinions, therefore, are completely unbiased."
1,"Cutesy, simplistic","I received this book as a gift, ....after reading it I disposed of it. I found it to be disrespectful of our Savior. Lucado suggests that the reason Jesus went to the wedding at Cana was because He wanted to ""twirl the bride around the dance floor"". This is the Son of God we're talking about, not some red-blooded human ordinary male.He uses a lot of space to write short, incomplete sentences that are supposed to grip us, I guess. It didn't grip me."
4,Inspiring,"Lucado writes in a conversational manner. His strength is in his ability to tell stories. He takes a familiar Bible passage and presents it in a fresh context. Like most writers he also has a gift for creating quotable phrases. An example is ""We seldom see history in the making, and we seldom recognize heroes"" (p. 33). A second example is ""Faith in the future begets power in the present"" (p. 44). And a third, which is an epiphany of an observation, ""I challenge you to find one soul who came to God seeking grace and did not find it"" (p. 53). Lucado's book leaves people feeling good about themselves."
4,Inspiration,"Highlights areas to try and grow in,to define purpose,understand your call in the body of Christ"
1,Awful,"I think I'll mention its good points first. The animation and art in this series is good. The Female lead is a pretty lady. That is the only thing that made keep watching it. There is plenty of action, but it wasn't too intense because I didn't care if the main character died and the series ended. All the bad guys are chumps. They are probably related since all of their noses looked like wieners hanging on the middle of their faces. They also have really stupid sounding voices. The series is kinda like James Bond, if he were a cyborg chick with mentally handicapped enemies. I found it impossible to care about this series at all. Out of the many anime series I own, this is the worst. I agree with the review that said, ""at least it was cheap"". If you pay money for this you will probably be very annoyed."
1,Dont buy this -Jult Warfell,"I had no high hopes for this series and true to my opinion, I was sadly dead on. Words cannot display how much time I invested watching this not to mention the cabbage I wasted purchasing this. -Jult Warfell"
3,Tactical Vest at a tactical price!,"I spent 6 years in the US Army in a Recon Unit. This vest may last for the average civilian shooter but never in a tactical situation. I use it for range purposes only and to store my live magazines. Other than that, it probably would break down fast in a field environment. Also it does not have any real adjustments so it will either sit loose on the smaller person or tight on the larger person."
5,Super vest,Very nice quality and anyone that complains is too picky. Very thick made and adjustable. I'm 6'2 250lbs and it fits great with a little adjusting. You will be positively surprised.
5,great vest,"great vest, heavy duty, i like the extra holder vs extra mag option, VERY adjustable, should fit most people.very impressed with the product, it is a steal for the price."
3,UTG Tactical Vest,"I was looking for a tactical vest that fit my budget and use. I would use this only in extreme cases of emergency. Therefore, I wanted something that would work, yet be affordable.The price is right. The fit is decent.The straps need to be modified, especially on the sidearm holster.I wrote a full review on it and several other items on my blog, which you can find by searching for ""best5zach"" or go here:[...]"
3,Great Vest but not one size fits all.,"This vest is surprisingly well made with a ton of storage. Bad news is, it's just way too snug for me. I am 6'4"" and 270 pounds. I wish it was bigger but will just have to give it to a smaller associate.."
4,Nice tac vest,"This vest is almost as sturdy as my US army load bearing vest. The modular design is nice (you can remove the shotgun shell holder, the belt mag pouches, and the pistol holster).Pros:Fits well once adjusted.Provides decent support with the belt.Pistol holster angle/location is nice.Belt is removable if you need it for something else or if you have a different load bearing belt you want to use.Cons:I do not like the ""sniper shoulder"" as they call it.It would be nice if there was a carabineer location on the shoulder for my AR.Vest can be a little loud until it is broken in."
3,"Good, BUT!","While the vest is well designed and constructed, the description says it adjusts to fit a 55"" or 56"" waist. I am a 52"" and it lacks 4"" fitting. It is a great product but should be properly described. It works well for my son but was a total disappointment for my first purchase through Amazon."
2,not worth it,"even though it's only 35 bucks or so its not worth it. cheaply made, everything's velcro attached and not customizable. holster is too small for much of anything. i got a better vest for $10 at a gun show."
5,The best ACU Vest..,This is 2 day fast shipping. I love this vest it comes with extra 2 magazine velcro magazine pouch. U can take it off the cross draw holster and put aditional magazine pouch. Fits my M4 magazines high capacity.. I love it. I'm 5'10 185 lbs fits good to me and very easy adjustable belts.
1,lLove all,"STOP!!!!! BUYING UTG TACTICAL VESTS WITH RUBBER SHOULDER RIFLE REST. THE RUBBER IS MADE OUT OF CHINESE RUBBER STINKS, SMELLS AWFULL. IT SMELLS LIKE ""MAZOT"" WHICH IS DIESEL FUEL. THEY MUST OF USE CHEAP PETROL BASE MATERIAL. DO NOT BUY ANY CHINESE ITEM MADE WITH RUBBER. I THOUGHT ""UTG"" COMPANY WAS MANUFACTURING IN THE UNITED STATES.HOW DO WE FIND OUT IF THE ITEMS ARE WE ARE BUYING MADE IN CHINESE RUBBER. FROM NOW ON WE HAVE TO ASK, BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS BEING MADE IN CHINA NOW... AND ASK BEFORE BUYING A RUBBER MADE ITEM;IF IT IS MADE IN CHINA DO NOT BUY, BECAUSE AS I AM WRITNG THIS ARTICLE MY HOUSE STINKS WITH THIS UTG TACTICAL VEST I AM GETTING A HEAD ACHE, SO I MA GOING TO PUT IN THE PACKAGE AND SEND IT BACK TO AMAZON...BUHUMBUG!!! :("
4,vest,I received this item quick. Right out of the box you can feel the quality. I quickly adjusted it and set it up for me. Neat thing is it comes with an extra couple rifle mag pouches that you can put in place of the holster. I currently have 6 tapco 30 rd mags and a couple metal 20 rd mags plus 3 pistol mags. Vest is comfortable and seems to distribute load good. Time will tell on the overall quality but right now I am pleased.
1,"Horrible Product, not even Airsoft Quality","After reading the reviews here for this product, some even describing how good this product is for various field applications, I figured it would be ok for the Range and utility. Not even close.The zipper tore the second time I put it on, while I was trying to adjust everything. None of the Velcro ""MOLLE"" knock off acc. would stay on either. The ""quick draw vest"" support anchors make it difficult to use effectively. Also the holster will not support any attachments on a handgun.Returned it, bought a better brand. Amazon was awesome per usual during the return process.After my experience with this UTG product I will never try UTG gear again. There is a reason its cheaper. Buy Maxpedition."
2,Not as pictured on website.,"I received these replacement mats for Christmas. The carpet is very nice, but the mats are not as pictured and are smaller than the photo without holes to secure them to factory tabs in floorboard. I will be returning these. Cheaper to buy directly from Ford."
2,Not what I expected,"I think she has a fine voice but I don't like the synthy, 80s style of this CD. I liked the more country stuff and this soul album is well, overproduced. Lari White is a talented singer/songwriter and I purchased Lead Me Not in both cassette and Cd."
2,"""Dreams Come True"" For Oshkosh (WI) Aficionados Only","I purchased this VHS 1984 film for my parents, and secondarily for myself, since it was filmed in my hometown of Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The film had a very weak plot and the character development was minimal. The film would appear to be of interest only to those who have lived in Oshkosh in the past or grew up there, in recognizing landmarks and the like. It was an average film, though a bit hokey."
4,A great overview,"Somebody gave me this book as a gift a few years ago. It is a fun read and a good introduction to the strange and wonderful world of insects. The pictures are excellent, and it does not get too boring. I see that the book is out of print so your chances of finding a copy are slim. You may see it at a book store on the clearance rack. If you do and your looking for a coffee table book about insects, this is an excellent choice."
1,complete garbage,this is a waste off time the movie the actors and story is all garbage TO ANYONE THATS READING THIS DO NOT PAY ANY ATTENNTION TO ANY POSITIVE REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE IT REALLY SUCKS BIG TIME THE ONLY WAY THEY ARE GIIVING THIS MOVIE ANY POSITIVE FEEDBACK ITS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME MONETARY GAIN FROM SAYING SO I WILL REPEAT THIS IS ALL GARBAAAAAAAAAGE!
4,Is Carradine still a nerd?,I thought this was one of the tops of 2007 horrorfest even though i felt this year was weaker then 2006. The plot is simple (eating and surviving)and easy to understand. It was to bad Michael M. had such a small part but the acting was good due to several veteran actors. This flick did have a few edge of your seat moments with the normal gore. I liked the idea for the ending as this was something entirely different. I did not find this movie boring as it kept me interested throughout but just don't expect this to become a classic. I found it entertaining and definitely a keeper for my collection.
3,sholud be continued......,"I read another reviewer say that these horrorfest movies shoulda been on a cable series like tales from the crypt or masters of horror and I completely agree. these simply aren't ""good"" enough to be feature films but I like watching them anyway and I think this one could have gone the distance because I like the premise of this probably better than any other horrofest film I've seen so far. this is what could happen when earth's resources diminish and it shows this without any ghosts or monsters. it shows people turning cannibal which is much more scary in my opinion because these flesh eaters are organized and people need to eat to live so its more truthful and real in that aspect"
3,Really? We ran out of gas?,"Not an all together horrible movie but not near my top 100.As a horror movie lover, I watched ""Tooth and Nail"" not expecting much from it. I was suprised because it wasn't as bad as I originally had planned it to be.While the storyline was decent the hardest thing I just could not get over was what apparently caused the post apocalyptic world they were living in. We ran out of gas? Riiiight. And no one in the world was willing put a little time into the study of alternative fuels. We ran out of gas and just started going crazy and killing people? Very very hard to believe.The acting was strong and the characters interesting. Each actor had it's own moment to shine and did so very well. The plot twist at the end was easily seen halfway through the movie but it wasn't a bad way to end it.All in all.... buy this movie discount. More than five bucks on it is just too much."
1,SLOW!!!!!!!,"I love the Afterdark Horrorfest movies....but not this one. I fell asleep within a few minutes. It is SOOOOO incredibly slow. Everytime I woke up, I felt like I really hadn't missed anything. That's how slow it was. Also, it had WAY too much unnecessary graphic sex scenes. I felt like I watched more of a porn than a horror movie."
2,Could have been really good.,"This could have been so much more interesting. They had a good premise for a movie, and they went and messed it up with a stupid bunch of cannibals. Lame. Decent acting even though the story went to hell pretty quick. I love most of the other horrorfest films, so this was a disappointment."
2,It is NOT a post apocalyptic movie.,"This is a basic slasher movie set in a post apocalyptic world. It could easily have been on a ship at sea, on a space ship, or some deserted island. Make no mistake this movie is all slasher. No need to tell you about the plot because its so shallow it has no bearing on the movie. The acting is engaging enough although not what you'd call good. The script is pretty sub par and really dumbed down. Effects are good as you'd demand in this day and age. Production value is pretty high. Character development is for s***. It's not horrible in any sense of the word so it avoids a one star rating but I can't say its really worth watching."
3,Tooth & Nail,"This is a well above average addition to the After Dark Horror Fest '07. It's not great, but I did really enjoy watching it. This post apocalyptic horror flick holds a somewhat interesting story, above par acting, and some excellent gore, though there was the opportunity to have more. The pacing is pretty good, and the final showdown, though nicely done, is pretty anti-climatic, I was left wanting more. Overall this was very enjoyable and a solid movie, nothing groundbreaking or supremely outstanding, but it didn't have to be, it's just good, and a very nice entry to the '07 line-up."
4,The original reference work on Objective-C,"The original reference work on Objective-C; the second edition was published May of 1991. So don't expect anything about OS X or Cocoa. But it's still a good book. If you want to read about the language itself, its history, the motivations behind its design, and its relationship to other languages, this is the book for you. If you want an introduction to the concept of object-oriented programming that is not mucked up by the foulness of C++ or Java, but rather gets you started down the One True Path of Cocoa right off the bat, this would also be a good place to start. I learned Objective-C from this book, and it is still handy as a reference work. Kind of the Kernighan & Ritchie of Objective-C. Four stars instead of five because it has less and less relevance for the typical Obj-C programmer nowadays, who is almost certainly coding for Cocoa on OS X."
4,The main reference on Objective-C.,"The first three chapters are conceptual, and compare various approaches to object-oriented programming. Chapters 4 until 8 are highly technical and give detailed information on the Objective-C runtime and class libraries. I find the chapter on user interfaces a bit sloppy. Interesting, on the other hand, is the final chapter with projects for extensions."
2,HARDLY A NIGHTS DAY,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA BE SOMETHING REAL SPECIAL BUT IT TURNED OUT TO NOT REALLY WORTH IT, EVEN THO IT DIDN'T COST MUCH, I KINDA WISH I COULD HAVE VIEWED IT BEFORE BUYING IT, BUT OH WELL. IT'LL GO IN MY BEATLE COLLECTION."
1,"This is for England, Not for the United States","Initially, I was excited to find this book. But when it arrived, I was very disappointed. If I lived in England, it would be amazing, and if I am researching something that would include British references, then this is your book. But I wanted this information for the United States. Nowhere is it mentioned that this is a British book."
5,One of a Kind,"During my recent purchase of ""Drugs for Less"", I was amazed to find that there were no other books available that offered this type of concise and helpful information. I was surprised at the volume of information which I found in the book. As a healthcare provider, I thought I was relatively ""savvy"" in my medication purchases, but had not given any thought to the pill splitting idea. Awesome book brought together by a Doctor who quite obviously ""CARES"" about the overall care of his patients."
3,Sweet harmonies,"Jade is one of the (nowadays) lesser known folkrock bands of the late 60s, and it's really nice to have this record back into print.Apparently all songs have been written by Marian(ne) Segal (except for a few bonus tracks), and most of them are really fine with great melodies and tender lyrics. All instruments are handled deftly, while the trump card must be the vocals: miss Segal has an excellent voice (though a bit too heavy on the vibrato methinks) and the harmony singing is stunning!On the other hand I am less impressed by the overall sound: as the songs themselves are quite pretty the addition of strings is making them rather too sweet.In short, Jade is more like Sandy Denny solo than Sandy Denny with Fairport, more like Tudor Lodge than Trees, and with a tendency towards an american folk sound.The accompanying booklet contains detailed historic information about the band by Marian(ne) Segal herself."
2,very small size,"Didn't expect this puzzle to be so small as it is only 5"" x 5"" base with a 4 1/2"" circle puzzle, very mini in actual size. Hopefully the grandchild will like it as the cost of shipping was greater than the toy price."
2,Not an action camera,"This camera has a VERY slow shutter response. It is impossible to take action pictures, but works well for stills. The pictures are good quality. The lag time appears to be 20-30 seconds. Imagine being at a birthday party and having to wait 30 seconds before taking the next shot every time. This camera is a battery hog. Also, HP does not repair their cameras, nor will anyone else touch them. They offer either to 1) give you the same camera refurbished or 2) give you an upgraded version of a similiar camera refurbished. In the case of the Photosmart 945, the camera has been discontinued and they will only offer option #2. My ""upgrade"" offer was for a $220 refurbished camera."
1,"Thought this was a good buy, but ...","I am trying to learn to knit on my own. I found this book and flipped through it in the bookstore. It looked like a great book to own.When I got home, I began to try knitting some of the simple patterns. I thought I was not knitting correctly because the patterns were just not working. After the third pattern being completely incorrect, I went on the internet to check up on the pattern. The pattern in the book was wrong, as were others.The book is a great idea, but it has three patterns, for sure that are incorrect. To me, that is too many.Needless to say, I am going to see if I can get my money refunded for this purchase."
1,Horrible,"If you dont know how to knit, then dont get this book. I have a large mule! Dont be fooled with the pretty colors and the neat tabbed pages. My girlfriend tried to learn how to knit by following this book (and after a one day class)and after about a half hour to an hour of trying, she still failed. I wish I could get in touch with Ms Jenkins to get my money back directly from her. Horrible!"
1,Full of mistakes,"I've worked up about 15 patterns and found mistakes in 3 of them, and 2 weren't worth the time. I'd recommend the Vogue Stitchionary instead!"
3,good information --- BUT,"The information in this book makes up a great reference for building a locomotive, but doesn't give details on important topics. I would recomend anyone considering building a live steam locomotive have this book, but don't expect it to be the only reference at hand."
4,on the other hand...,"On the other hand, (I also wrote ""well..."") the graphics are very good. The photos are all very nice and the drawings are exquisite.Note: I was in a bad mood when I wrote ""well..."", and that is why I gave it a lower rating that time.Trevor"
4,Yucky!,"I really liked this book. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought it was gross when the people ate the bugs. UGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, you should really read this book if you LOVE anything gross."
