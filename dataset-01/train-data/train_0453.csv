5,Great magazine,Love this magazine. Issues are large so I feel that I get my money's worth. But the cost was low to begin with it really is a great deal. The best is having product recommendations of items that get their stamp of approval after strict testing.
5,Renewal,"I was not going to renew this magazine when it's expired in July 2009. However, the renewal rate was good, so I extended for two more years. This magazine is ok. One thing I don't like about it is you have to skip some pages to see the continuation of an article. It's annoying. Other than that, this magazine does have some interesting articles from time to time. If you like to cook, they do have some nice recipes."
5,I love this magazine!,"Good Housekeeping is a wholesome, clean, serious magazine. Various topics that may be found in an issue - how to raise children, household tips, financial help, or marriage advice - suggest that the magazine is geared towards the middle-aged to the older woman. I'm married and only in my 20s, but I still get so much out of reading the articles and advice anyway.I absolutely love this magazine! I was looking for a magazine with good, long articles to read, and I found this great one. They even re-designed the look, and it's excellent. Everything is more organized, clearly separated into their respective sections, and each page is clearly marked with the section header so I'll always know which section I'm on.I particularly enjoy the articles about real-life triumphs and tragedies, Talk to Me by Joy Behar about relationship advice, and Peggy Post's Etiquette Dilemmas."
2,I don't learn anything!,"I ordered this because I wanted a magazine that was all around, something like Martha Stewart, but not too high browed and undo-able. However, I've gotten 2 magazines already and I feel that it's kinda worthless. I don't get enough recipes. I don't get enough relevant articles. I think the magazine's articles are too general and I just don't like the articles too much. I would say that I got what I paid for - basically nothing."
1,For the desperate-to-lose-weight housewife,"Was once an excellent, reliable mag, with all sorts of helpful information on different subjects. Now, it's mostly adverts with a few pages of info and recipes here and there, and half of it seems to be geared toward housewives who are intent upon watching every calorie. I guess if you're ocd about your weight and you're looking for another way to beat yourself up, this is for you."
2,"Same boring things, again and again","There is nothing in the least stimulating for the mind or creativity here. I found most of what was in this very cliched. It seems the plan is the same every month - the ""follow the ADA food pyramid,"" ""put your food on a saucer to think it is substantial,"" ""get more exercise,"" ""I survived cancer,"" and so forth. It is half ""positive thinking,"" but otherwise a denial that anyone has a mind, heart, or soul. The feature articles are very poor quality, such as the Elizabeth Post quasi-etiquette, wherein one may not share news of an event with friends without saying ""no gifts please,"" and friends are looking for others to meddle in their lives (what is polite about having a friend who wonders if her dress fits well being told to go to a gym class?)The other reviewer who said ""not enough"" is quite right."
5,Best magazine for my Mom!,"My mom loves to look and read magazines about anything and everything that has to do about HOME.Out of all the magazines out their for women, my Mom thinks that 'Good Housekeeping' is the BEST MAGAZINE. Almost every night before she retires to bed, she's looking at her Good Housekeeping. Because my Mom enjoys this magazine, I give it '5' GOLDEN STARS.Thanks,Donald M."
2,Not like it used to be,"Been reading ""Good Housekeeping"" for years and loving it. Haven't subscribed in awhile. What a change! Way too much advertising and not enough substance! What happened??? But for $5.00, I guess I shouldn't complain??????"
3,Same old trick,"I get impatient reading about subjects that I already know. It must be written/edited by and for the generation that cannot cook and hires their housekeeping done. What really gripes me, however, a new subscriber gets last month's issue, this month's issue, and finally the current issue just days apart. Now 12 issues are already down to 9. Not just Hearst periodicals--almost all of them do this. I COULD HAVE GONE TO THE LIBRARY."
5,Good Housekeeping is a great magazine,"I've subscribed to Good Housekeeping for a while now and really like this magazine. I took the opportunity to renew the subscription through Amazon.com for a couple of reasons:1. I trust Amazon.com - they stand behind what they do.2. This was the best rate in town, bar none, that I could find.I received a promotional E-mail ""two for one"" in that you could subscribe to a magazine, pay for one year at a discounted rate and the magazine was renewed for two years! Can't be beat!"
5,Love the magazines!,Love the magazines...love the great price. The order was expedited and we received the first issue of each magazine very quickly!Thank you for a wonderful opportunity! I'd love to know when more deals like this one become available!
5,Good Housekeeping Magazine,"Good Housekeeping Magazine is the best all around women's magazine. It has something for all ages, great tips on just about everything. I trust the items with the Good Housekeeping Seal.And I really enjoy reading every issue each month. So much variety and so helpful. A jewel among today's magazines."
3,"Just not for me, but good magazine-","I think this is a great magazine, at least from the one issue I read. However, its just not for me. I wasn't interested in many of the articles. There is a great variety of topics and interests covered, including ways to save money, de-clutter your home, several recipes, and beauty product reviews. The ads were minimal, and I did notice a few coupons throughout. I'd say that if all of the regularly featured topics are interests of yours, this mag won't disappoint. Smart, up to date, fun and refreshing."
4,gift,was given as a gift and they were pleased.. I forget that magazine subscriptions make very good gifts that continue to give
5,Very nice,I really am liking this magazine. It's not full of ads and crap I don't care about. It's helpful and I enjoy it!! I got a great deal on a year with a coupon I got from amazon so even if it was a bad magazine I wouldn't of lost any money :)
5,Fast service,Only took a couple weeks (maybe 3 weeks at the most) for the subscription to start. Very nice!
2,sound isnt very loud,I bought this for my son for christmas about 3 yrs ago. when you push the buttons the sounds isnt as loud as it should be. I was disappointed my son still has the book however he doesnt ever ask me to read it to him and he LOVES Nemo.
2,didn't work,The sounds didn't work on this book yet the description did not mention that. The battery acid had leaked out of the batteries. I wouldn't have ordered it had I known.
1,Not as pictured,"Did not ship the ""Old"" formula as pictured on the website from Alpharma. They shipped the new formula, same as now available at Costco, from another manufacturer. This ""new formula does not work for me as it contains other ingredients that irritate my skin. This is going back."
5,Carry This Message,"This is an excellent book for AA sponsorship, and the ordering and timely shipment of it through Amazon was a very smooth transaction."
5,Brilliant,"I can't recommend this book enough; it's even better than ""The Steps We Took"".Joe McQ surely knows how to keep it simple and pass on the very powerfull message.Just buy it!"
1,"Insipid, tedious, vapid pile of steaming bovine scat","They say hell is a place of eternal torment filled with indescribable, unbearable mental, physical, and emotional agony. I'm certain ""My Dinner With Andre"" will be the feature presentation on movie night, forever."
1,Realy 0 stars...,"Let's put it this way: It's like Seinfeld, only there is nothing even remotely funny in My Dinner with Andre, no one from Seinfeld is in it, and it's called My Dinner with Andre. Now, let's see the other reason it get's no stars (Now that I think about it, make my score negative one star), is that this movie is about 2 hours long (if not longer...), and all these people do is talk. That's right, ALL THEY DO IS TALK. Oh, wait, something else does happen: they eat. My God, this thing'll have you on the edge of your seat to see if the restaurant isn't out of pie... that was a joke. But there aren't any of those in this movie. in short, do not see it.P.S. If you want to read another one of my reviews, click on Manhunter: The Director's Cut on DVD. My review is dated in August, and it is titled: TO BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Brilliant Movie -- Disgusting DVD Transfer...,"This is one of my all time favorite movies... But my heart sank when I saw the quality -- or the lack of -- the print they used for a basis... The reel changes show color shifts that you expect from cheesy arthouse theaters -- the color balance is all over the map. The luminance levels shift throughout the film as well.Malle, Gregory and Shawn should be better represented than this level of transfer gives us.If you absolutely have to see this DVD: play it on a 12"" Black and White TV and enjoy the outstanding performances... then write and complain to the slackers that put this awful transfer on the market."
5,The magic of intelligent conversation,"""My Dinner with Andre"" is a glorious example of a lost art: intelligent conversation. It should be required viewing for every single member of this society, particularly anyone who considers the discussions among those imbeciles on ""The View"" to be ""deep,"" or who believes that any cable-news talk show host has even the slightest clue what he or she is talking about. We live in a culture of idiots, ladies and gentlemen, and when something like ""My Dinner with Andre"" comes along, we should snatch it up and devour it ravenously. It's a genuine one-of-a-kind."
1,Poor DVD Transfer,"I first saw this movie when it first came out and it and it soon became one of my favs! This type of film may not be for everybody because the setting takes place entirely inside a posh NYC restaurant with two friends discussing everyday life. The film is all dialogue, as I said before it may not be everybodys cup of tea.I purchased the DVD several months ago and promptly returned it because the video quality was horrendous. I do not remember if the movie was filmed poorly or the transfer from video to DVD was flawed but, none the less the DVD version was very grainy. It looked as if somebody taped the movie inside a theater with a Super 8 camera.I do not recommend the DVD version unless you don't mind inferior video quality."
1,Nice Restaurant.,It really is just that - two guys having dinner at a New York restaurant engaged in a conversation. One from which you'd walk away in two minutes had you been there in person.
1,DP!=DVD,Full Screen. Does that say full screen? What is the point of a DVD if not to deliver the full quality of the original print.All involved with this great film [especially its fans] deserve something better than the VHS quality of the cassettes that routinely go missing from libraries. But this is not any better. Letterbox this movie. It is high time.
2,"Interesting, but not captivating.","The concept is good, but the dialog is lacking at times. It does not contain any of the wit or philosophic dialog that ""Mindwalk"" contained.Honestly, you are more likely to overhear a more interesting conversation at your local coffee house. Also, if you want a better dialog driven movie, watch ""Harold and Maude""."
2,Blah Blah Blah...,"A phenomenal masterpiece? Really? This film just comes off to me as dated, self-righteous New York BS. Andre Gregory comes across as a humorless, paranoid freak with Wally for the most part just swallowing his inanities whole. I suppose I can appreciate this as a period film of New York in the early 80's when it was cesspool and everyone was a neurotic walking around trapped in their own head. Other things about the movie I appreciated: Wally's ""inconceivable"" comment (Princess Bride!); beginning scene in the New York subway with all the graffiti; the old waiter guy, who seemed to be the only one in the film who wasn't lost in space. I guess I just feel like if these guys' mothers raised them right, they wouldn't have grown up to be such dissaffected twerps."
2,self-absorbed,"listening to the amateur and dumbed-down ""philosophical"" statements in this movie makes me wonder if whoever wrote it just took Intro to Philosophy 101 and layed down some stupid, un-provoking dialogue to impress his friends."
1,dinner?,they hardly ate anything. a bite or 2 of each portion.i hope they got the rest of the food they didn't eat for take out.what a waste of food.
2,Bourgeois Bohemian drivel,"Poor Andre. Travels the world in search of depth and meaning, but where does he end up? Why, back in New York City, of course. Back to his comfy upper middle class life replete with a doorman, summers on Long Island, posh restaurants, children he no doubt sends to private schools (children who incidentally would now be of age and probably trying to amass large dot.com fortunes and think of the old man as a nutty gas bag). Andre himself admits he misses the sixties, thereby revealing everything you need to know about this film. In his younger days he felt alive and connected. Now he's old and disenchanted, the typically insufferable baby-boomer. And to compare such a life to that of a concentration camp victim is the height of immaturity and self-absorption."
3,SEE IT WITH MY BREAKFAST WITH BLASSE,"As a young man struggling to be an intellectual, I was so impressed with this that it is hard to believe I was taken in by this nonsense. Years later I was completely freed of the pretense of this film when I saw the wonderful ""My Breakfast with Blasse."" See the first if you haven't already and then watch the second."
5,Penetrating...provocative,"So many wonderful reviewers have offered their appreciation for this transformative film that I can only add that when I think of this film, I rarely see two men sitting at a dinner table in a restaurant. Instead I have vivid images of the experiences that Andre describes. His mesmerizing story-telling has me so absorbed in his journey, particularly the theater camp in Poland, that I follow him there in my mind's eye and have sometimes felt a bit like a participant. It is the kind of things that happens often to me when reading a gripping memoir, I forget where I am while I am reading the book. As for the power of this simple, low budget, thoughtful film, I know my mind & imagination were well-stimulated, (not my adrenaline glands) and for this I thank everyone involved in bringing to life.To more free-spirited living and deep all night long conversations about the mystery and magic of life."
4,Great for alternative uses!,I love having all denominations in my wallet at all times. You'll be surprised how often you can use this! Leaving huge tips to waitstaff (WITH the real tip). Bets people jokingly offer. Just have fun with it!
1,Is really a Bully bar,The nerf bars don't realy fit a 2500 hd unless you bend 1/8 inch steel.... And is it realy a Bully Bar I think if I ordered a Westen they would have sent the same generic nerf bar.... They show Bully Bars in their add but send something that doesn't even state that it is a Bully bar or have Bully stamped on the foot pads like in their add.. I feel like I got the old Bait and Switch. Can I vote less than 1 star?
4,Fresh New Music,"After hearing the Dave Murphy Band at a small coffeehouse in Madison, NJ, I fell in love with the acoustic guitar and meaningful lyrics. Songs such as ""Under the Lights,"" ""The Bottom,"" and ""Save Me,"" make you want to hit repeat on your CD-player and listen for hours. This is a must have for any fans of folk-type music."
5,Great Game,"This is a really fun game. It has 10 fun games which include balloon pop, darts, spelling bee, and my favorite miner. I had this game in 2000 and just bought it again. I would recommend buying this game"
1,Way Too Soft,Not suitable for medium to large dogs because they can disappear it in half an hour. Good rawhide chews of this side should last for hours.
1,Don't buy this album,"One word, terrible. I asked for Nosferatu's Rise (awesome) for christmas and my mom saw this album under the ""users who bought this album also bought"" category. Save yourself the agravation and pass this one. I feel like Ive been robbed because I put the time into listening to it. There are only two good songs on the album and one of them is all but ruined due to shabby recording quality. The rest either are ruined due to the recording quality, or have terrible lyrics and crappy music, or usualy both. Hunter's kiss is sung in the first person from the perspective of a deer that has just been shot. Stupid stupid stupid. If you want an album like this except better in every way buy the soundtrack to the Witchblade comics. You won't miss out on anything if you dont read them as I dont and still thought it was awesome. Common, Peter Steele is on it."
2,Dont Even try to teach yourself C++ with this,"This may be a good book for intermediate to advanced c++ people, thus I'm not gonna pan it. However don't even think about this book if you're new, or just finished C++ for Dummies and think you're the Man. Schildt's style is neither fun nor funny, and unless you already know c++ fairly well this book is unreadable.Schildt has no penchant for making even the easier topics understandable to first year people; Herb seems out of touch to anyone but accomplished code jockeys.For a better beginner-advanced beginner book try Stephen Prata's very helpful C++ tome."
3,The teaching methods are somewhat flat,"This is a book full of examples, but the teaching methods seem to be insufficient; especially the layout and design of the book are somewhat flat. It contains no pictures, no extra sections for emphasizing tricky subjects, but only a huge number of examples... So you might spend considerable time browsing and solving those example questions. There are solutions for each question at the end of the book."
2,Hard to read. Poorly organized. Definately NOT BEGINNERS!,"I already knew C when i started using this book. This book is for experienced programmers only.Even if you are an experienced programmer, you will find this book extremely hard to read due to the fact that IT'S COMPLETELY TEXT. NO PICTURES AT ALL. The text itself is poorly written with briefy explanations that keep the reader guessing. Examples are there but the important code is not differentiated from the rest of the code.A much much better c++ is or should be written. If you are thinking of buying this book, do yourself a favor, go read the man pages and save your money!"
1,Beware,"For detailed comments, do a dejanews search on 'Herbert Schildt' in comp.lang.c++.moderated before buying this book!"
4,A solid jewelry box,"I purchased this as a christmas present for my fiance, and it turned out really well. There was lots of room for earrings and rings, and the drawers were able to fit her necklaces snugly. The travel case is excellent and holds the perfect amount of jewelry for a small vacation.The one complaint she had with the product was that the front panel has to be flipped down for the box to be opened. It's just a questionable design choice, but makes sense due to the locking flap on the front.Overall though, this is a solid box and I would recommend this to anyone with a small jewelry collection."
1,NOT genuine leather- truth in advertising please,I bought the large jewelry box sold by the same Tech Swiss retailer at an exorbitant price and it was made of PVC and smelled very strongly of toxic PVC fumes. Avoid.
5,Gift for wife,"My wife love her Jewelry. She has lots of it, here there everywhere. Who's fault is it when something goes missing? Yep mine! So this year was time for a storage place not a new necklace. Looked all over but found nothing I liked. Went online here to Amazon and searched through what was here and found this. Looked kinda like the one my Mother had so I took a chance. Showed up in two days. Two day on the super saver free shipping! Opened the box and was very pleased. Wraped it up and hoped for the best. Wife opened and was very excited and happy. Thanks Amazon."
5,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!,If I could purchase every last one of these jewelry boxes I would; they're just that great! PERFECT GIFT FOR ANYONE WITH TASTE!
1,Mirror broken,that was a christmas gift for my wife and when it oppened we notice that the mirror inside was broken.shame on you for selling defective products like this.Carlos
3,It's okay,"This jewelry box is nice, and I really like the lock and travel box. However, the right side of the box was separated from the interior portion. It was pulled away and I can see the old glue spots. The rest of the box is nice, and I'm sure I can fix this with superglue, but I'm disappointed because this jewelry box was a little pricey. Also, the earring holders are only for studs. I wish there were more space for dangle earrings, and I don't even use the stud holders. I am not sure I will keep this box."
4,Great Product,"These fit great and look very cool. They don't protect as much as I thought, but the dog doesn't lose any field of vision. So that's a plus."
3,Would buy again if I got the correct size,I bought a large based on my dogs weight but it is not the correct size. He is an 80 lb Labrador who was neutered at 6 months which means his head is not as big as it could have been. He also has a long nose and his eyes are fairly close. I think he would wear a medium goggle based on his face structure.
3,Hung Out to Die,"Never served.Have read plenty of war stories telling of brave men though.This story of the Army's fight trying to get back from the east side of the Chosin Reservoiris the saddest war story I've ever read. And I dont think I'll ever read another.Arrogant plan + Typical Army SNAFU + a frigid weatherfront = Total Disaster.Four straight days and nights under wave after wave of attack.No help coming. Get back on your own, guys.Frostbite. Ammunition, fuel, and bandages all gone.Then chaos panic and death in the bitter coldin a place far far away from home.How can there be any sadder way to die?Most all know the name George Armstron Custer butDon Carlos Faith seems like a character out of a Shakesperean tragedy.Groomed, then doomed, then given the CMOH by the generals as an attempted makegoodto gloss over their arrogant and bloody and heartbreaking boondoggle.I've read this book twice and it effected me even more the second time."
2,East of the Chosin,"The book goes into extreme detail throughout its course. It tracks different platoons through companies, battalions and regiments. I found this very distracting and unless you're doing specific research on a very small group, not at all helpful. It's a good book, but there are far better books on the Korean war, that do not break things down by the hour and platoon and suddenly switch to an area 1 mile away to another platoon and such."
5,Gripping and chilling account of a deadly spiral into near annihilation,"I've been in the Army for a long time, with tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, and this really hit home in many ways. The utter disappearance of the regimental commander, LTC Faith shooting KATUSAs that wouldn't follow orders, men freezing to death, the endless waves of Chinese attackers crashing into the American lines. Truly an excellent account of an incredibly ugly tactical situation. A great companion about the Korean war to This Kind of War."
4,Better than most,"No, Rissa is not perfect. But she's a damn sight better than most.This is one of those books that I keep on the shelf and pull down when I want to go back to an old friend. Yes, I know every page and every storyline. And yes, the more I read it, the more it seems familiar. And yet, I keep reading it.Rissa, herself, presages Heinlein's Friday quite amazingly (with the exception of the genetic modification bit) - intelligent, resourceful, deadly as needed. Another book, Rebels' Seed, is echoed again in David Weber's Heirs of Empire. Star Rebel and Rebel's Quest... you get the idea. It's as was said - by Heinlein - writing consists of taking someone else's work, changing the lines, and filing off the serial number.That being said, you will be entertained by this book. And, if you find yourself wondering what happened next, or how Tregare got that way, or just HOW Zelde lost the earlobe - Busby created enough books in this universe to satisfy you."
5,Great reading,"Guideposts is something like a the Readers's Digest for christians, only better. A variety of articles and letters from and about people of faith."
4,wont subscribe,"I love the magazine, but once you subscribe...you get inundated with all kinds of offers. I felt like the magazine was a gimmick to get me on their mailing lists ...and all their friends. I finally had to quit taking it....then all the other offers stopped."
3,Beware of all the junk mail,"If you need motivational stories, this ia a great magazine, but read it at your local library. Otherwise, you will receive a lot of junk mail, too. From renewal letters starting 6-8 months before expiration to charities asking for your donation. There is no month without some unsolicited letter from GP.The magazine itself is more like 4-5 stars, but the junk mail is so annoying that I deducted 1 star and decided not to renew my subscription. I won't even tell them my new address when I move. Better lose 3 numbers than be ""subscribed"" to unsolicited offers in my new place."
5,Essential to any 80s Collection: Candy-O's Cold Follow-Up,"""Panorama,"" the darkest and most stylistic album of The Cars, is clearly the most overlooked disc of America's finest power pop outfits. In the first few weeks after its release, it sold well, with ""Touch and Go"" garnering heavy airplay. But many listeners, I remember, didn't quite warm to its haunting songs. Still, I love it, even though it lacks many of the bouncy radio-friendly songs of the band's earlier releases. The songs are haunting and full of Ric's quirkiest of lyrics. And, despite its heavy synth feel, the album is laden with some of rock and roll's greatest guitar hooks. What's more, it clearly shows that the Cars were, again, ahead of their time. Listen to later U2 and you'll hear the influence of ""Panorama,"" though Bono and the boys may not even be aware of it. I only wish rock's critics would give it its due."
3,Music for a rainy day.,"I don't know why I feel that way. Perhaps it's because I first listened to it on a rainy day; in any case, it fits. Anyway, besides that, it's an excellent record. I never really realized that until recently. I've always liked it but never really conceded to myself that it might very well be the Cars' best album. That's arguable, of course (though, surely, unarguably superior to HEARTBEAT CITY), but it has certainly developed into my personal favorite. The only song I would consider filler is ""Running to You"" but it's decent and takes nothing away from the whole. Standouts are the title track, ""Gimme Some Slack,"" ""Getting Through,"" (I'm blown away by the lyric ""and TV ads that sell erections""; whoah! apparently, Ocasek could see 20 years into the future!) ""Misfit Kid,"" ""Down Boys"" and ""Up and Down."""
3,New Wave was nearly over,"Almost as good as Candy-o, but even more trendy and the New Wave sound is losing the punkish, bizarre edge and becoming a bit monotonous. That being said, there are some good songs on this album, oh yes. ""Touch and Go"" is one their best songs ever, with an odd, lurching beat in the verse that gives way to a stunning, grooving, chorus, that gives way to one of the best guitar solos ever recorded. ""You Wear Those Eyes"" is a beautifully weird love song. There's a bit of reuse of old ideas and lyrics (how many times can Rik Ocasek make wordplay with ""come""), but it's not a bad album. New wave had several elements or angles to it, one was its punk roots, but there was also an influence of the 'robotic' sound of bands like Kraftwerk. At this stage in the game, the keyboard sounds are a bit tamer and the groove is getting very robotic and mechanical. This is their last really good album."
3,This is not their best,"I love the Cars and really wanted to like this album, but I bought it when it first came out and was immediately disappointed. I have tried listening to it several times hoping the songs would grow on me but to no avail. It sounds very stripped down compared to their first two efforts--having very thin arrangements and lacking melodic strength. It does still have a few good songs to recommend it though; Touch and Go, Gimme Some Slack, Don't Tell Me No and Misfit Kid. These songs are among the groups best songs and I still listen to them on my ipod. The other songs are all non entities. All the other Cars albums are great (having all or many more good songs) and are worth the buy--and this one isn't bad considering it has four really good songs on it. Get this to complete your collection or just download the songs you like."
2,"Great band, weak effort!","Panorama is the Cars third album, in three years. While it looks like many fans do enjoy Panorama, the album doesn't really do anything for me. ""Touch and Go"" was a minor hit, and I didn't even really care for that song, most of Panorama sounds bland to me. For the hardcore fans only!"
2,Colossal Disappointment,Let's be honest -- the songs on this album are just simply not in the same league as the debut LP or the brilliant follow-up Candy-O.Whether or not this album was better than other stuff on the radio at the time is barely the point.The album was a colossal letdown from the first two albums.PERIOD!!It's good to be a fan of the Cars and another thing to steer listeners to their best albums -- this ain't one of them.
2,DARK,"The first two Cars cds, were well produced, tight on the playing, and the songs were well written. This cd is just the opposite. The songs, are not great, most are average, and their are no stand outs. The production is muddled, and the playing this time out is not as tight as before. The songs aren't all bad. ""Panorama"", Touch and Go"", both rock, and have a great bass line running thru them. ""Down Boys"", and Don't tell Me No"", have potenial, and ""you Wear Thoses Eyes"", could really have been a hit, but the production almost kills them. Rest of the songs are not much, just filling space. The singing this time out is more raw, like the playing, it's not the polished sound, that they had before. Buy one the greatest hits, and skip this one."
4,Totally weird and totally cool!,"Are you thinking of buying your first CARS album? Well, this probably isn't the best choice. I would recommend the debut, Candy-O or Heartbeat City for your first CARS album. Panorama, on the other hand, is for those of us who want to go all the way with the Cars. It's weird, even by Ric O's standards, but it is so groovy. You will be surprised how catchy some of these tracks really are - they stick like glue and they're pretty darned deep. It is ""arty"" for new wave, but I think they pulled it off brilliantly. It is my favorite of all Cars albums simply because it is exactly what the Cars were: weird, but cool! And most of all, FUN - even if it is ""dark"" it has a silly side that proves these boys had a great sense of humor to go with their musical genius. Buy this is you already have an album or two of theirs and want to expand your library."
1,Find a Hole and Bury It!,"I never did get this one! Perhaps two decent songs on the whole album. A major mistake. I was in denial for so many years, but now I come clean! Why else would it be cheaper. Own it for collectors sake only!"
1,Sounds & words without music & songwriting,"As a fan of the Cars' debut and Heartbeat City, I thought the reviews here might point to another solid through-and-through Cars' effort.Not so. I don't understand how anyone can positively rate this record. While there's one or two OK tracks, this disk is just a splash of sound effects, guitar rhythms, and weak lyrics that someone apparently hoped would equal music. They don't."
1,3rd's a puke,"As a wee'un I was hoping the back-sass and cheek would continue. ""don't cha stop"" [sic] . . ""just what i needed"" . . ""candy-o"" . . and then I heard for what i had been waiting: the sound of andy devine on his horse - bushy, bagot and green - trying to hurry his goof'd rotundity from the efforts of some old pale thing. ""touch and go"" . . good god's grief and lee van cleef, this is not the sound that saved rock."
5,GLORIOUS PRAISE SONG,"I BELIEVE THAT THIS SONG IS A WONDERFUL SONG TO EXPRESS THETHINGS THAT GOD HAS DONE AND IS DOING IN OUR LIVES. JUST REMEMBER WHAT PROBLEMS YOU'VE HAD AND THE ENDING TO THOSE PROBLEMS AND YOU WILL ""SEE WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE""."
5,A fountain of awsome information!!!,"This book is a real eye opener as are all of Mr Busby's books! The author actually slept on the floor in one library while he complied information and researched texts to put together his works!! Altogether 20 years of research.His bibliography is just amazing!This book takes the reader on a journey through ancient egypt while making clear, practices and beliefs as well as events that contribute to the secret. Incredible, information on the pyramids, underground structures and of course the Bible.A great treasure in our times!!!!"
4,The Missing Clue,"This is a great book that covers a lot of ground, from the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx and their underground connecting Temples, to the Torah and its connection to Tarot, and Masonic Initiation and its connection to the Egyptian (Magus Initiation) Mystery System. However, given the quaility and depth of information throughout this book the cypher clue at the end of the book seemed really ambiguous and anti-climatic. Nevertheless, there may be method in this madness."
2,hmm...just read the review,"I heard one song from this album(Navigating the Windward Passage) on the Fat website and loved it. Then I got the album.Half the songs on here are exactly the same as the aforementioned one, and the other half a different singer who sounds really whiny. The energy is only there on the one song that happened to be the one that fat uses to advertise the band(big surprise there), and the rest is either really repetitive and uncreative or is absolutely the lamest I have heard in years, next to Blink 182 or something even worse. If you want a good, harsh, melancholy album, don't be fooled into getting this album. Go get a dillinger four album instead. Actually, you might as well go hear ""Navigating the Windward Passage,"" cause it rocks the hell out."
5,lawrence arms - apathy and exhaustion,"fantastic. this album out-does thier previous ""ghost stories"". the lawrence arms feature a great melodic sound encompassed by vocals thrown between scratchy and snarly to soft and gentle. with superb songwriting and the ability to keep your ears glued to the almost 'alkaline trio-esque' intensity, this album is the lawrence arms' greatest to date."
4,Value for Money,"I had purchased clear2o 3 water filter pack 1 month back. It is filtering water very well. When compared to other filters in the market, cost is bit high"
4,way better than i thought,"I had pretty low expectations and typicall sleep on 800 thread count sheets. Of course these don't compare with those, but price value is awesome. Not Scratchy in my opinion as one reviewer said, they are wrinkly however!! I am quite pleased overall."
4,Great!,Love these sheets and they have lasted a long time. The only complaint is the seeming on the corners seems to come undone after a lot of washes. Just worn out I guess. I bought four sets and just put a new one on when they get too worn. I still have two sets left. Love the fact that they came with lots of extra pillowcases wince we use a lot of pillows on our bed. We have a really deep mattress and they seem to not fit as well after the first 5 or so washes. The still stay on though!
1,Not soft at all,"I was very disappointed when I bought a set of these sheets for my husband last christmas. We put them on the bed, and I didn't sleep comfortably the whole time they were on. They were very itchy against my skin, and I hoped washing them would remedy the problem, but no such luck. We put them back on the bed, and again, I slept terribly. We haven't used them since. Thank goodness they were on sale, and I only spent $12.99 on them!"
1,VERY poor quality,"I was hoping the complainers were employees of another sheet company, but after opening a package of these sheets I must agree with them.Yes, they wrinkle badly, but then they are cotton, so I could live with that. More important, they are extremely short and feel flimsy. My mattress is not thick, so I could get the bottom sheet around, but the top sheet is probably close to a foot shorter than a normal sheet (measured it -- top sheet is 90"" long, and normally should be 102-108""). I've looked around in the product description and can find no dimensions listed that might have clued us in.Giving this product a ""list price"" of $60, or even the Amazon price of $30, seems ridiculous. I bought them cheap, and still feel they were overpriced because they don't get used."
5,"Excellent deal, great quality!","I purchased both the linen and the sage varieties. They're much better than I expected at this price. I have a plush mattress with an extra down topper that I had no problem with either the fitted or flat sheet being long enough. The colors are much more attractive than in the pictures and they are extremely soft. For those having trouble with the wrinkling, when the dryer is done, take them out and fold them instead of leaving them there for a day or two! That's common sense. I'm impressed with these sheets and would definitely recommend them. In fact, I've already got friends and family who are ordering them since seeing mine. Thanks Amazon!"
1,These sheets are seconds!,"Got my sheets yesterday, threw them in the washer last night (with Regular Tide), and this morning as I hung them out on the line, I saw several places where the bolt of fabric had not been dyed correctly, leaving large white spots in this ecru set. Still wondering whether it's worth the aggravation to send them back or not for the price, but they WERE NOT advertised as seconds. I've bought several sheets over the years that WERE advertised as seconds that were in better shape than these. They are soft, however, I'll give you that."
3,Not as soft as I thought,"I've bought a Queen Sheet Set from Divatex very similar to this one at Marshalls and loved it. In fact, it's our favoriate sheet set at home. However, this set turned out way below my expectation. My old set deserves 5 stars (very smooth and soft) but these are just not soft at all. I can't understand why same thread count sheet set from same manufactur would be so dramatically different...the only good thing about this set is that the sheets did not fade after the first wash but neither did my old Divatex sheets...Would not reccomend."
2,Not Impressed...,"These sheets are a great value but in this case, you get what you pay for. If what you need is the cheapest sheets available, these are fine. But if you like smooth, soft sheets you will probably not be happy with these. They almost feel like really cheap flannel. I would not buy these again and will hardly use them."
4,Good set of sheets for a great price,This is a very comfortable and affordable sheet set. I was very happy with this purchase. Thanks Amazon!
2,Short Sheeted,The sheets are comfortable but wrinkle easy. The top sheet is way to short for a queen bed.
3,A good book all in all.,"Alien Bodies is a good book to explain Sam's background. The Krotons are rather clumsy, but it was nice to have them back. The Prologues were pretty boring, but I found the character of qitoxl (if that is the right spelling - rather complicated name!) to be very intresting. The scientific gobbledeegook gets annoying and is not that easy to understand. It's worth buying, and is an enjoyable read."
2,Did I miss something?,"This was the first of the BBC novels since ""The Eight Doctors"" which I didn't enjoy. Sam and the Doctor don't really seem to work well together in this story. And three quarters of the way through the book, it occurred to me that nothing had actually HAPPENED yet, and probably wouldn't before the end. There's a gratuitous chase, and lots of flashbacks. There's a new alien race which has potential, but it's a little confusing just what they can do or have done. The Shift is interesting. And in the end, it turned out that my prediction was correct and nothing actually did happen in the novel. There are a few Twin Peaks references (the soldier character keeps saying that things ""aren't what they seem"") if you're into that. This book is not a must-have for the casual Who reader (if there is such a thing)."
1,Another crappy new Dr. Who novel!,"I have bought six of the new Dr. Who novels and liked only the first one. What is wrong with these authors??? Is Terrance Dicks purposely picking losers to write these in order to make himself look better????If you want a real boring novel, this is it!"
4,Picture this...,"You're driving along a deserted desert highway in....oh, say...New Mexico, on a warm summer evening. Along your journey, you stop in a a few bars, gas staions, diners, and small towns. Somehow, you manage to climb inside the heads of a few of the local characters, and get a synopsis of their lives. None of these folks are probably heroes, or villans. Just average folk, trying to get by. Ridgway does an amazing job of bringing local color, and character development into songs only a few minutes long. Each one is a brief escape into someones world other than your own. I guess I have been hooked on this artist since Wall of Voodoo did ""Mexican Radio"". Good music, nicely recorded, unusual but strangely compelling stories. Kind of like an non-SciFi version of X-Files. Buy it."
2,Obscure songs that were obscure for a reason,"For people who must have everything Stan Ridgway recorded, this is another item for their collections. I only want the good stuff. Apart from Beloved Movie Star, this is material that never goes anywhere. Reviewer Lon Jones was objective about this album -- it is a mish-mash of inconsequential and incomplete work. I won't discourage people from buying the CD, however, this should be the last Stan Ridgway album on your list to purchase. First get Partyball, Anatomy, Mosquitos, then The Big Heat, Black Diamond, and Snakebite. If you're still hungry for more, then Holiday in Dirt is just the ticket for you."
3,"Not Bad, for a B-sides album","I don't mind B-sides albums, and R.E.M.'s Dead Letter Office is one of the best I've enjoyed, but parts of Holiday in Dirt seem a little underdone. Stan's goof on Bing Crosby's drunken fall into an orchestra pit, breaking both his legs, is my favorite on the album. I like Stan's sense of humor, and my favorite tracks are always the Garage Band '69's. I could do without My Beloved Movie Star though. It's an interesting montage of Stan's career, the leftovers that never made it on to the final album. All in all, a decent grab bag of Ridgway's music."
2,Let's Cut the Holiday short,"I like Stan, but this one is just a mish-mash of leftovers that didn't make it onto previous albums, usually with good reason. I was very disappointed with this CD and recommend that you give it a miss."
5,pleased,"product is as advertised, and it will be an asset to me as we are building a new house. I dealt with amazon a few times and have had positive experiences each time."
4,GREAT Magazine,"I used to subscribe to Todays Homeowner, a great rag. Unfortunately it was purchased by This Old House which covers what the rich and famous own. It's great to have dreams, but for those who want to act on them, or more appropriately, the rest of us, there is Family Handyman.For help redoing a floor, rehabbing a kitchen, replacing a deck, discussions on the latest techniques you will want Family Handiman. A great product easy to read in 30 minutes, with just the right amount of coverage with great pictures."
4,Very handy,On time and a great mag. Many projects and handy tips! Can't wait for the next issue. Thanks for a great mag.
5,Excellent resource for the home project set,"I first encountered ""Handyman"" at the barber shop of course. It seemed like every page had tools, hints, and projects that were relevant to my inclinations. Found a subscription offer on Amazon and the first issue arrived full of the same content that intrigued me the first time. The magazine focuses on home solutions that matter. I highly recommend this publication to anyone who likes to fool with tools and hopes to improve the hacienda."
4,Family Handyman (1-year auto-renewal),"I like family Handyman Magazine,I don't like Readers Digest Association ! They send books that you did not order, then threaten you when you don't send them back or buy them. They do the same with Birds and Bloom. They are a bunch of Worms!"
2,Aimed at men but has some good ideas,"I agree with previous review that this magazine is clearly aimed at men. The ads for sexual enhancement drugs and devices are distracting from the content. I'm not against such advertising, but I would have like to see more ads aimed at HOME IMPROVEMENT, not sexual improvement. Clearly the demographic for this magazine is aimed a men more than women, which was a serious disappointment for me. I only received two issues, but I will say the ideas were good ones (although again, aimed more at men--organizing the garage for instance). If you are looking for practical ideas for around the house (installing a solar water heating system, fixing your garage door) then this magazine is for you. If you are looking more for home improvement ideas and easy to complete weekend projects, you may want to keep looking...especially if you are a woman."
2,Nothing special in this magazine,This is a quality product that is more than marginal. It is written in an easy to read manner. The ideas and projects are nothing special. I would recommend this product.
2,Handy man magazine,It was a Christmas present and did not start until weeks later per email. It's middle of January and still not receive it?
1,Family Handyman Magazine,item not yet received even though order was placed 69 days ago. no contact from company.
2,"Very light on details, lots of subscription requests.",The magazine is a bit light on specifics. I don't think any article was more than 2-3 pages (not counting useless photos).Of the articles that SHOULD be detailed (like building a shed) they gloss over thing like how to do the roof joists. Instead of explaining how to lay it out and do the math they say 'joists are X by y on Z inch centers.... really? How about explaining how to notch the joist for the fascia and sills?The article is simply a play by play of how THEY built a shed... good luck if you want to learn how to build one.They also constantly beg you to renew. A LOT.
5,Love it!,"I love this magazine! Lots of great ideas and easy project instructions to follow. I have gotten a lot of ideas to ""freshen up"" a house I bought. Some projects I have used as it is in the magazine and some have given me other ideas to make it work in my space. Great magazine!"
5,"Handy Tool For The ""Do It Yourselfer""","I love this magazine. It has so many helpful tips and tricks packed into each edition. I used to dog ear important articles for later review and usage. I typically had so many pages with the tips bent over, I decided to stop doing so. From tips on how to keep painting tools clean, to how to remodel a bathroom over a weekend, this is a great tool to keep in your handyman toolbox no matter your skill level. I highly recommend this subscription for any household."
3,It's OK for the price,"Lot of ads, not a lot of content. And some of the content was pretty basic that most (older) people would likely already know. Although for a young adult, might be something of interest."
2,Buyer Beware-Overpersistent marketing,"We got a gift subscription from a friend to Handyman Magazine several years ago. We enjoyed it somewhat, but it really was not suited to our interests. So we let the subscription run out (this was over 5 years ago). We still have their stupid telemarketers calling to ask us about our subscription. I have repeatedly told them that we cancelled it and don't want it, but they call back anyway. I'm pretty sure I already told them to put us on their do not call list, but they still call! I just told them again. Let's hope they listen this time.If you plan on continuously renewing your subscription, you should be ok. But do not ever give this as a gift!"
4,Lonf time subscriber,"I have subscribed to Family Handyman for ten years or so. The mag is great and has great ideas, tips, features, etc. My only complaint is that there are (too frequent) repeats of projects/similar projects. How many times do I need ""the best garage storage system...""? Still, I take it all in stride b/c that's what happens when you are a long-term reader. Let's put it this way, the last time I renewed my sub., I made it for four years and and added a two gift subs. The good out-weigh's the bad. (And, heck, $1/month?! Enjoy. (And get to work!))"
3,handyman mag,Sent to son and husband--seem to enjoy not sure of utility but think its useful for ideas around the house
5,Awesome Magazine,"Love this magazine, I have been purchasing it on and off for the last several years. Always has great tips that are inexpensive and very useful for in the garage and around the house. I would recomend it highly."
3,why so long,"the issue that prompted me to buy the subscription was full of useful hints and tips as well as well written articles and illustrations.. My big question is why does it take so dang long to receive your first issue 6-8 week with mag subscriptions. Everything else you order from the net arrives wthin,at the most, a week. What up wid daT?"
1,can not rate or review a product you didn't get,I have still not recieved my subscription yet you ask for a review of the product? Isn't this a poor business practice
1,3 months for first issue?,"Although the magazine is great, it takes Amazon almost 3 months from the order date until the first issue is received. That is an unheard of amount of time to process any order!"
1,Never ship the product,I try to order this prodcut second time and hope they will improve the shipment time. They mentioned on the product which only take 4-6 weeks to ship the product. I have been waiting the date and at the end they postphone to 3 month to ship the product with email me the reason why they have to postphone. I will be very careful if you purchase from this company. Now I end up can't return the product becasue it passed the 30 days.
1,"We have not yet received any magazines for Handyman, we are waiting for it to come, still has not come","Please let me know when this was sent out, as we have not received it yet.We ordered the Magazine Family Handyman, and have not received as of thisdate."
1,They dont mail this out.,I just cancelled my subscription.I ordered this magazine around September of 09. Never received a copy until I contacted Amazon. Got one copy and it was shredded beyond use. Magazines suggestion was to contact my post office. I get everything else just fine through my post office. My suggestion is better. Cancel.
2,poor delivery time frame,I think March 23 is a very poor time frame for delivery date of first issue. Never again!!!
5,A good magzine!,"I have had a subscription for one year and I decided to renew it for another two years because the magazine is a great source of DIY projects, a tips from experts and reviews of different tools and instruments. I recommend it for DIY enthusiasts of with different levels of experience."
3,"Good Info, Bad Ads","I like the information brought forth in this magazine. Some things were relevant, some not (25 steps to cleaning my car is not very relevant). The only gripe I had with this mag is the effluous flow of Viagara and ""Better Sex"" video ads sprawled throughout the magazine-- I counted SEVEN such ads in one issue! My kids love to read ""This Old House"" and ""Old House Journal,"" but ""Family Handyman"" was off limits. Too bad. To the magazine writers: Not EVERY handyman-type magazine reader is a man, and not EVERY magazine reader needs to be bombarded with the same crap that floods my email inbox."
1,never received it.,I have submitted three subscriptions in the past three years and I have never received a single copy. How about that.
1,Horrid Delivery,After receiving the first three issues...I have received another one since!!! No response from the publisher; further inquiries are pointless!!! Save your money... great info in the mags...the delivery is far too unreliable.
3,Very Basic and Not Creative,"Buying this magazine was really just okay; I personally have had this for 6 months and only found one useful idea out of the 6 magazines, and would suggest you just look at in a book store over a cup of coffee. It's not worth buying a years' worth subscription for very basic ideas, and use for a coaster on a side table.My suggestion is to go to a library or a known bookstore to look through this magazine and see if they have the previous months if they have them. Otherwise most of the tips that you see in this magazine are online and probably better than what you will get from this magazine, which again is why I suggest thumbing through this at a store."
4,Great Magazine!,I look forward for this magazine to arrive each months. Articles are informative and most of the time pretty interesting!
2,Disappointing,"Handyman magazine turned out to be kind of disappointing. I've received 4 issues now and I rarely find anything interesting in them. The magazine is full of ads--I know, all magazines are, but this one is particularly bad. In every issue, there will be an article about some product and then just a page or two away there will be an advertisement for that product. It makes the magazine less credible to me because it appears that they are simple writing stories about their advertisers. Some of the DIY how-to's in the magazine are very advanced and require expensive specialized tools and knowledge. The editing is somewhat careless, too, as many of the projects will be missing a step that is mentioned in the summary or in a diagram. I was hoping for tips and how-to's I could actually use in real life, but that magazine just doesn't have them. I won't be renewing my subscription."
5,I love my Family Handyman subscription!,"When Family Handyman arrives, I usually read it from cover to cover. I'm an avid remodeler and the tips provided are quite helpful. I even let my carpenter know some of the time saving tips and he was unaware of some of them, even though he has been in the business for 20 plus years!"
5,Best Magazine Ever,"I absolutely love magazines and subscribe to numerous ones but this one is by far my favorite and most informative. Don't waist your money on popular mechanics, just payine for the ad's. This is a true handyman mag with a wealth of projects and info. Would Definately Recommend!!!"
4,Monthly handy man magazine.,"Like the handy tips. Most projects I won't do , but like seeing how they would be constructed.However, sent in tips that i have never seen or been contacted about."
2,The Man's People Magazine.,"Each issue has countless advertisements, and very little useful information. I wanted a magazine with 3-4 interesting half day projects per issue to choose from, and a focused review of 1-2 basic techniques with tips from craftsmen. If this is what you're looking for then look elsewhere, and if you've found it then let me know in the comments section."
2,"Good, but after three issues...","The magazine was ... good/ok. After the third issue, I started to regret subscribing to it. Too thin, not enough juicy content that made it useful. Why would I want to check out their web site on how to do some stuff when I subscribed to the magazine? After seeing the pictures of what I wanted to build, the bottom verbage was ""Check out our web site on how to do this..."" Junk. Sorry..."
1,Scam artists,"Let me start by saying that I legitimately enjoy this magazine and intended to renew every year. When I received a hard-bound book in the mail I thought, ""Oh what a nice gift. It must be part of the subscription package."" Silly me--I didn't read the fine print (I'm not sure there was any) and I just put the book on my shelf. A couple months later I received a bill for $30 for this book. No thanks. You can have your book back, but you'll need to come pick it up. I'm sick of sleazy scam artists who rely on fooling decent people as a way to boost revenue. I will not be renewing."
3,OK magazine,Would not pay more than the $6 I subscribed for. Not very many projects listed. The tips are wonderful. Cable management guide was great. Also the household items for easy tricks is great
1,Unhappy,"I have a current subscription for the family Handyman, and have purchased an additional two years with this offer. These people won't acknowledge my new final subscription date, but they keep sending me more offers to renew my subscription. They also fail to put the new expiration date on my mailing address sticker of the magazine. It feels like I've been scammed."
4,OK cd,"I bought this cd to my fathers b-day, just heard it a couple times... I was surprised! Its a very good compilation... Buy it if you like slow rock/old rock..."
5,viva,viva las bio dome... gotta love this movie. pauly shore and steven baldwin are absolute morans and i laughed the whole time
4,a good place to begin for younger listeners,"As someone who was introduced to noel coward by the pet shop boys, (""if love were all""), I think this is a great album and can only help to introduce more people, previously unaware or unfamiliar with coward, to his work. if we only listened to the snobs, coward's music would be dead, as would classical and opera, all of which i listen to and was introduced to by the more ""popular"" artists. How do the music snobs know that this cd would kill an already dead noel coward? Maybe he'd be thrilled with it! The best songs on the album are the beautiful ""Sail Away"" by the event's organisers, the Pet Shop Boys; ""There are Bad Times Just Around the Corner,"" by Robbie Williams, and Divine Comedy's ""Marvelous Party,"" which reminded me a little of Underworld's ""Born Slippy."" The worst performance has to be the one phoned in by Sting. Elton John's cut was a bit disappointing as well. But all in all, it was a delightful collection."
1,Forget it...Forget it...Forget it...,"The idea is not bad. Contemporary pop performers doing classic Noel Coward songs. Unfortunately, despite some talented individuals, the songs are almost without exception ruined by interpretations that destroy Cowards' sense of melody, tempo and lyric.The word abysmal comes to mind. Coward was understated, subtle, mischievous, sentimental and melodic in his music. These characteristics are undiscovered on these performances.Paul McCartney is one of the few who tries to do Coward justice and seems to at least have the musical sensibilty to understand what his song is about. Even Elton John, who has the ability and talent to do better, sadly disappoints on Twentieth Century Blues.If you want contemporary Noel Coward, look at the cast CD of All For Love, the 1999 show featuring Twiggy and Harry Groener. They get it right!"
3,sketchy,"I want to think this is a good saw. I've read all the reviews and I'm excited about the features and cababilities. My problem is that I bought one at Home Depot a month ago, opened it up and it looked like someone had washed the table with a wet rag. The blade was new and there was no dust, but inside the plastic slot where the blade decends, there was a '3' written in red marker.The saw cut well but the motor buzzed and I had a bad feeling so I took it back. Tool guy had to OK the return and agreed that it was sketchy, said he'd never seen that before. Another Home Depot just dropped the price $50 to $349 so I tried again. Brought it home, looked new, but the blade guard drags when you lower the blade and there is a red 'S' written inside the blade slot now. I don't know what's going on. I'm hoping this saw is new and not refurbished. Not sure what Dewalt is up to, but beware of ordering this one online."
2,Poor fence design,"Harry homeowner might be fine with this saw, but as a cabinet shop we are not. The fence design is such that it will not stay square over time with heavy use. Both sides are molded out of the same piece, so there is no re-adjusting when the whole thing bends over time. After many bad experiences, I am finally done buying anymore yellow tools."
4,Good deal,"Just don't have any illusions about using this inside because it has a dust collector. The dust collector is a joke. It does catch some of the dust, but most of it just goes every where. Which is fine, whatever, its still better than trying to do the job with a circ saw."
5,Great saw even for a non-professional,"Even though I was just using this to put a floor in my sunroom (and don't have much skill with power tools or carpentry), I thought the saw was easy to use, safe, and accurate. I found it worthwhile to buy a good quality saw, as it appears the Dewalt will continue to perform for many years to come."
4,Does exactly what it's suppose to do every time.,Have only used for a few cuts so far. Works fine. Does what it's supposed to do with out worry about accuracy.
5,DW716 Miter Saw,"Very well constructed and easy to use. Came ready to go out of the box. Made only minor adjustments to miter positions. Miter presets made cutting baseboard trim, even around a bay window, very easy."
5,DW716 Mitre Saw,Right out of the box it works great! No adjustment necessary and I am tickled with the shipping as well.
5,A must read for any women who desires how to be faithful in Christ,"I originally received this book as a gift for my birthday - great book! The book briefly covers the biography of 5 amazing women of God. What I love about this book is that their stories and struggles are no different from that of today's women who desires to follow and to be faithful to Jesus. I definitely resonated with a few stories of these women - and all of them lived in different time periods. This goes to show that God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow. The God who provided and cared for these women then is the same God who provides and cares for His people today. A definite must read!!"
4,From The Milk Factory,"Morgan presents here a textbook electronica album, reminiscent of early Warp or Rephlex releases. If this album appears at time formulaic (pardon the pun), it remains a rather interesting, is rarely daring, piece of work. Ranging from spacious ambient moments, often wrapped up in blankets of warm analogue sounds to classic techno, Morgan intentionally visits familiar musical grounds to add his sonic imprint. Steering clear from entirely abstract or abrasive soundscapes, he carves beautiful melodies in the heart of complex hip-hop-infused beat structures and makes good use of his chosen sonic territory.Reflecting on classic electronic themes, this album denote an element of musical maturity as it builds on the musical legacy of the last fifteen years, yet appears fresh and interesting enough to retain the attention of the listener all the way through"
5,The Magic Continues,"The Spoonful's third album (not counting the soundtrack LP to ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"") is the most satisfying of their all too short career. It was their first album of all original material and all of the songs were written or co-written by John Sebastian. These are all Spoonful classics and continue to reflect their wide range of influences: the jugband sound of ""Henry Thomas,"" the countrified ""Darlin' Companion"" and ""Nasville Cats,"" the bluesy ""Coconut Grove,"" the folk-influenced ""Lovin' You"" and the contemporary sound of ""Summer in the City."" The consistent high quality of the material on this album is all the more amazing when you realize this was their third album in 12 months!On the back cover of the CD, R.E.M.'s Peter Buck declares HUMS is the ""best, most consistent record by America's most underrated band."" He's right. ESSENTIAL"
1,Varese deserves better,"Varese urgently deserves a decent and independent biography and an approachable analysis of his musical works.Clayson is not up to either task. This book is poorly written, full of historical inaccuracies and/or misunderstandings, and devoid of any substantial musical analysis.I truly regret having spent money on this."
1,Pretty damn bad,"Alan Clayson's book on Varèse's life is written in a ludicrously chatty style that owes a lot to bad rock criticism. He is not a real biographer and is simply not worthy of his brilliant subject; it's unfortunate that this is all we have for a Varèse biography in English. The book also scarcely seems to have been proofread or edited at all. However, I don't feel I totally wasted my time by reading the book; it's a useful overview of the important events in Varèse's long, unique career, even if it provides precious little useful insight into his character or musical innovations."
5,required reading,"This book has an eye-catching title, but really the title suggests just a small portion of what this book provides. A real look at how to really raise children with different emotional needs, treating them like individuals and people - and offering concrete and specific suggestions and techniques, not the usual cliche drivel. Every parent or future parent should receive a copy of this book. Not a bad resource for non-parents too."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this work. I had checked some of the entires in the original and found that the ttranslation was lacking and that in those couple of cases the point of his translation was the opposite from what appears in the original source.
3,Nice plane,"Plane is made of good quality. Probably for older kids; my kids are 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 and love planes so I thought this would be great based on reviews. I don't care for all the pieces. It comes in several pieces and some are hard to put on. After I spent a half hour putting it together, my son took it apart in about 30 seconds. I just wanted a plane my son could play with. It looked great from the picture but I wish it was pre-assembled and stayed together permanently. I am going to put in back together one day and hot glue it together."
3,"Fun for 5 year old to take apart and reassemble, until it breaks","The plane comes apart into many pieces...the 3 landing gear wheels, the two wings, the two engines that hang off the wings, the ""lid"" of the passenger compartment, seats, etc. Then there are luggage pieces, 3 ""guys"", the food cart, the luggage cart etc. I'm surprised we haven't lost any pieces yet. My five year old and 2.5 year old love playing with this. Only the 5 year old is able to assemble it, with some help for the wings. The wings hook on underneath the plane and have a white cover with little tabs to hold it on, these have now all broken off, so the wings can not attach now. I guess I could glue them on, but till then, it's a plane without wings."
4,"Great movie, Bad product","This is a great ""sleeper movie"". Funny as hell and really quirky. Great companion to Roxanne. One of my favorites. The only issue was with the DVD. I missed quite a few of my favorite scenes due to the DVD pixelating and locking up. Bummer."
5,Classic Steve Martin,"If you enjoy Steve Martin's dry wit then this is the perfect movie for you. Martin pokes fun at the self-absorbed lifestyle of the LA elite. Nothing is safe from cell phones, commuting, name a Los Angeles stereo-type and Steve exploits it. It's also interesting how Steve reveals a bit of his own trepidations about aging and trying to keep up in a world that has ""gone-crazy"" for style over substance. Buy it, Rent it, watch it then show it to a friend. Then watch it again and you'll see something you missed. Sarah Jessica Parker is also fabulous as the young carefree fling for Steve's character, the way she bounces around is just so....LA. Hug a traffic sign today. Note: this is the first time I've seen anyone go on a date for an enema. ;-)"
3,Steve and Sarah and the electronic freeway sign,"Steve Martin shares the spotlight with show-stealers Sarah Jessica Parker and the most interactive electronic freeway sign I've ever seen in L.A. STORY. People who live in Los Angeles or at least know a lot about the city probably got more jokes than I did, but L.A. STORY was worth seeing."
5,"A magical, romantic LA love story; humorous LA ""culture""","I just have to watch this again and again. The plot is pure magic, lighter than air, and so much fun! I get to feel like I'm in California without ever leaving home. There's some great comedy here and so much I can't even begin to decide what I like best. The music is awesome, there'some great cameos, and the story line is inspiring. It's a fun spin through LA in the 90's. Any one for a ""half-double decaffinated half-caff""?"
5,Self-Serving Smorgasbord,"Whimsical, and at times even magical, look at the smorgasbord of mostly self-serving shit-heads who populate both L.A. and the entertainment business in general. Steve Martin heads an excellent cast as a TV weatherman in a city where the sun always shines. Watch for the grilling ""interview"" he goes through just to get a dinner reservation at a trendy new restaurant."
3,NO CHEMISTRY.,"It's an okay movie, but there was no chemistry between the stars (married in real life), and without the chemistry, I just didn't care enough to accept all the supernatural stuff. The motives and actions of the Victoria Tennant character were incomprehensible, and I found the character smug and unlikeable. I was kinda hoping the couple wouldn't get together, but it was all too predictable that they would.On the plus side, Sarah Jessica Parker was bouncily wonderful."
3,I DON'T KNOW?,"I HAVE WATCHED STEVE MARTIN BEFORE AND HE REALLY MADE ME LAUAGH, BUT IN L.A STORY, HE PUT ME TO SLEEP!"
2,not a laughing matter,"When I'm in the mood for a light, romantic comedy, ""L.A. Story"" isn't it! This movie starts out pretty funny, but once Steve Martin meets Victoria Tennant everything goes downhill. This is supposed to be a story about two people falling in love, but where's the chemistry between them? Their few funny moments are when they are apart. When they're together, what a downer! Sarah Jessica Parker is the best thing about this movie, and I'm not even a fan of hers. The talking freeway sign is just weird, like out-takes from another movie entirely. I give this movie 2 stars for trying, but it could have been so much better. What a disappointment!"
1,"No history in ""L.A. Story""","One of the most unispired MArtin movies, the beginning of his downhill..."
5,The Magical Journey to True Love,"This is the story of a journey to explain that truth can come from very unexpected places - one of the greatest Love Story's ever told, without the glitz and nonsense, and, yet, there's definitely glamour, and Victoria Tennant is the Queen - I get 'lost' in this movie everytime I see it - all the time, you are pulling for both of them, then get mad because they both stray off-course with someone else, but cheer like crazy when his plane gets stranded - a truly wonderful Love Story..."
3,RENT IT FIRST!,"I wouldn't watch it again. This is a very so-so movie. All the gushing reviews here had me expecting otherwise and I usually dig Steve Martin, but this movie is tepid at best. The romantic chemistry is pretty nil. The comedy.. well, I laughed once or twice. It's half drama, half fantasy/absurd. For drama, Shopgirl is a lot better. For comedy, there are much better Steve Martin movies. So what does this picture offer? Well, some tongue-in-cheek jabs at life in L.A., which I could appreciate having lived there for a while. It ends on a positive (and predictable) note. But mostly, I was waiting for it to end. A seriously lukewarm affair. Rent before investing is all I can say. Or please buy mine."
4,It ain't Shakespeare,"The movie works for me and I am not sure why. The movie in the end is very silly. However, all these parts do work for me: the references to Shakespeare, the use of Enya music, the love story, the gentle poking of fun at L. A. culture, the sly look at pretentiousness, and the strange, silly mystical moments. The movie has some clunkers in the dialog, but some of the pithy quotes work very well. The movie is well written and ties the disparate parts together rather well. At its best, this move is a funny and touching meditation of true love in L. A. At its worse, it has some crude humor. Fortunately, the meditations far outweigh the crudeness. This ain't Shakespeare, but it is better than most of the romantic comedies out there."
4,A DVD review,"Being originally a Southern Californian, I found this film to be a hilarious satire on LA life. I don't think a East Coast person would get some of the humor. Not being from the LA area, even I missed some of the jokes. None-the-less, a funny look at LA and Southern Californian lifestyles. The DVD doesn't have that much to offer as the description seems. The production notes were the best giving some background on the making of the script and the film. The ""hidden menus"" are just short interviews with the director. The featurette is just an extended trailer for the most part running about 7 minutes. A must film to own if you are thinking of moving to Southern California or are a transplant such as myself."
4,Steve MARTIN at his wackiest best,A funny poignant movie with delicious music [[why is there no commercial sound track? It took me two years to locate all the music to make my own!] I watch this movie every two or three months...and always find something new to laugh at. I listen to the tape I made everyday.
4,A comedic-satire-fable-love story-fantastical movie event,"Steve Martin's fable about a weatherman looking for love is goofy and over-the-top in a way that is not goofy or over-the-top. See Steve roller-skate through the museum and critique impressionistic art! See Woody Harrelson fire Steve! See Steve's parody of Hamlet! In this creative world, showers come equipped with ""Slo-Mo,"" traffic billboards rearrange lives, and Sarah Jessica Parker is the embodiment of helium. Other cameos include Rick Moranis and Patrick Stewart. END"
1,nothing new....predictable.....save your money,"Kevin Hogan just writes the same old stuff that has been pushed in the self help categories for decades.There is nothing new, original or even interesting.The covers to his books always look so good so you get ready for a life changing experience only to be severly dissapointed, to discover you have read this some where else in an older book.See Dale Carnegie etc.I dont like the way he loves to tell the reader or make them believe what a nice man he is with stories of good deeds, such as giving a little girl in wheel chair a gift.Tasteless...You should not boast about your actions its like trying to convince some one you are really honest they end up thinking the opposite.Its about time some one wrote a 'selling your self book' with out the usual smile and be nice blah blah blah retoric.Theres more to it than whats in this book."
5,Great songs - cool live versions,"EATB has a great album here! Songs like Over the Wall, Never Stop, The Back of Love and The Cutter really jam and Ian and Will do them just differently enough to keep them fresh and alive. I saw them in the fall in NYC and they sounded great then, so I had high expectations for this album. It's surpassed those because the set is awesome, the sound is good and there's a live air about it - no boring rehash of studio songs."
4,How to get a fifth star?!,The only thing that keeps this from being a five star album is that it does not include all the songs that are on the dvd and also seems rushed as songs almost blend into one another. This should have been a 2 disc set. The same goes for the recently released Neil Finn live album. I ended up burning my own!
5,Me wish for Simon & Simon & Sasquatch.,Me just finish watching 1st season of Simon & Simon. They two brothers that work together to solve crime. They very different. Now Sasquatch have to spend long time to think about who favorite Simon. A.J. smart and use big words. Rick tough like me. Me like truck he drive. He and A.J. find trouble but work together and get out. Me who is Sasquatch think it differences between A.J. and Rick that make it work. That probably lesson for me and Owl.
5,Simon & Simon,"Simon and Simon was a true family show. There was just enough drama and humor to keep everyone happy. I am amazed that Season Two isn't slated to be released.If your new to Simon & Simon enjoy the somewhat campy but overall good show. If your revisiting as we are. It is refreshing after so much ""in your face"" tv shows of today.Kenneth"
5,Bring the other Seasons Please!,"I give the Simon's 5 stars all the way.. I grew up on this show.. Super-fantastic. Great stories, humor, and serious topics at times. We want the other seasons released please!! I have had enough of reality tv.. we need to get back to the series like this.. I highly recommend this series to anyone.. It is kid friendly as well..."
5,"Simon & Simon, I Love This Show!","This series was a hit during the '80s. I caught a few episodes here and there, but wasn't a die hard fan. I have recently seen some repeats on satellite and I love it. The chemistry between the two brothers is great. Their adventures are fun. They thrive on intrigue and trouble. The stories are usually predictable and corny, but it beats all the violence and gore we see on TV today. I am only sorry that out of nine seasons, only season one is currently available."
3,Simon and Simon season one,I love the fact that you had these b/c I really enjoyed Simon and Simon when it was on TV. However; I have had trouble playing Disc two. I have not gotten to 3 and 4 yet.
5,"Great show! Loved it when I was a kid, and I love it today.","It's little wonder that there have been poor sales for this show! WHERE was the ADVERTISING??!! I only came across the first season, because I kept checking Amazon periodically, after I saw the A-team and Magnum PI being released. I thought surely this show, the Fall Guy, Night Court, and many other 80s tv shows would follow. I really find it hard to believe that the millions of American children, who grew up watching this show, wouldn't want to get this series. And many others for that matter! If sales have been poor, it's due either to poor advertising, or no advertising at all. I don't think the companies that own the rights to these shows, even know their audience!!"
4,Blast from the past,I have to say this box set of Simon & Simon was a blast to the past very well done and enjoyable to watch.
4,Great entertainment value for family with teenage sons,"We have two teenage sons (15 and 17) who enjoyed viewing Simon and Simon with my husband and me very much! It took them by surprise that they liked it so much. Good stories (not great, but good and entertaining), good acting and the whole premise is fun. The relational dynamics of the two brothers with their many differences yet brotherly bond of childhood memories and shared experiences got the attention of our two sons in a fun way. It is relaxing to know that the scenes aren't going to get explicit or embarrassing. There have been other great reviews of this DVD set - in fact those reviews encouraged me to order a set for ourselves. But I want to add my two cents worth that for family viewing for older teens, this has been great. We certainly hope there will be additional season releases soon!"
4,Bring back the 80's please,"The only reasons I gave this 4 stars was due to the inherent bugs being worked out in a new series. The quality of the DVD picture is excellent. This series actually gets better as it got older, so it was a nice treat to get the bonus episode from season 2. Kudos and bring on season 2."
5,Excellent Show. Well Worth The Wait,This show ROCKS. Cant wait for the release of the other series. Great theme music with action and humour in equal measures. One of the best shows of the 80's. Not to be missed.
5,Fantastic classic game,"Even my 4-year-old can play this game with ease (albeit with someone older reading the cards until he got familiar with the rules). The skills required to play the game are skills that transfer easily to everyday life...decision-making, strategizing, taking setbacks in stride...plus it's tons of fun! I highly recommend this game to both kids and adults."
4,Always a good game,"Sorry is always a great game. This one is very colorful and a new look, except the board broke with first use. The old boards were much stronger."
3,"Sorry is just a newer, cheaper game with a modern day look to it.","I used to play Sorry as a child often. The game has not changed a bit except for it's looks. It now is brighter, more moden and very attractive."
4,forgot about this CLASSIC,"My son recently turned 6 and it says this is a good game for kids as young as 6. THEY'RE RIGHT! I'm usually good at games, but my son is much better at this game than I am. He's a natural. I'm happy because it helps him build confidence and I'm sure it helps in other ways too."
3,Good for Kids around 4,My 4 year son likes it but i was bit disappointed with this game.This is a board with circles in the center and you slide the pawn and based on the circle it lands you get points. Not something for kids above 6.
2,Sorry,"Two adults and 2 children played with this game. It was very slow moving and the younger child, age 6, quickly became bored with it. Frankly, I became bored with it. We decided we would change the game to quicken the pace if we played it again. All in all, a disappointment."
3,Sorry!,This game was fun the first and second time you play it but when you figure out that the game is pretty much based on luck and no strategy you'll think twice when you want to play this a third time. Although this is still a good game for the family. It features a detailed bored with a deck of cards that have number 1-12 and selected cards that say SORRY! this means you switch places with another player. All in all I would recomend this game to anyone who loves a game of luck.Your Friendthe Z-MAN
1,TRAUMATIC CHILDHOOD MEMORIES,"All I remember about this game is getting into fights with my brother when one of us would taunt they other with ""sorry"" (...)when we sent a piece back to the home square. This game taught revenge and frustration. you work so hard to try to get out of the starter box, only to be sent back in by a smart-aleck younger sibling. I hated this game, and would not inflict this kind of trauma on my young 'uns."
5,Great Game!,This is a great game for children who have graduated from little kid games. This one has very simple rules. I highly recommend this game to parents who enjoy playing games with their children. Fun for the whole family! i would recommend for ages 5 and up.
4,Sorry!,"I like this game because it can be very fun. I don't like this game because it can be not-so-fun. It can be very frustrating, but it is usually quite fun. You can be either red, blue, green, or yellow. But you'll have to watch out because as you move around the board, people can ""Sorry"" you. It's fun but it can be annoying. When my family plays it together, sometimes we get mad at each other. Sorry!"
5,My 8 year old nephew loves this game!,"This game works well with 6-9 year olds. Based on random cards as well as strategy. Object is to get all four of your color pieces to your home by going around the board. Each number card means something different (i.e. 4 = go backwards 4 spaces; 11 = you may trade places with your opponent). Players who get a ""Sorry"" card get to send their opponent back to Start!"
5,Sorry by Hasbro Games,"I loved ""Sorry"" as a kid and young adult...I bought this as a gift for my son and his children. So far, they like it too!"
5,"Sometimes You're Sorry, Sometimes You're Not!","Sorry! Family Night Game Edition is one of our family's favorite games to play.It's a great game and we enjoyed watching our youngest children learn the different strategies of the game.At first our five year old daughter was a bit timid about knocking another players piece back to startand wasn't too happy when it happened to her.Our seven year old son, on the other hand, thought it was great fun to bump another player back to the beginning.Although, like his sister, he didn't like it when it happened to him!Taking a cue from our reactions they learned it was okay to bump and to get bumped.Once they began to learn the different ways a player could get around the boardand reach the safety of Home the game became a favorite of theirs.We knew they got the idea of it when, after playing a few games,one of them said, ""Sometimes, I'm sorry and sometimes, I'm not!""Exactly! Just like you won't be sorry if you buy this game!"
5,Great Classic Game!,"I bought Sorry for our family game playing nights and I am not disappointed at all. Our 5 year old is able to play along with us, and the game is easy enough to follow so that he has the chance to win also. We have had a great time with this game! I would recommend this game to families with young children that want to play a game where everyone has fun...young and old."
4,An educational game!,"Sorry is a wonderful game for helping children visualize math, read numbers and familiar words, identify themselves with certain colors, and learn to strategize. Forget the recommended ages; kids can learn this game at age 3 or 4. Just simplify it by playing with only one or two pawns each. You'll enjoy it for years."
4,Fun Game for All Ages,"I played this as a child and loved it. Now I'm a parent and I find that it's a great game to play with my 4 year old who gets extremely excited when he knocks my pieces off the board. :) It's a game that anyone can win, so I think it's ideal for children and adults to play together."
4,love the great info it gives!,I moved to los angeles about 3 years ago and its just great to have a magazine that unveils some cool places to check out in the city. los angeles is such a big city and i know i can go online to search for places to go but how great is it to have it in one magazine. i'm excited to check out places. i got turned into this magazine from a colleague and so far think its informative and great!
4,worth it,I used to just read this magazine in my dentists office. I find it very helpful. Makes planning weekends a breeze.
1,Transaction review,I can't review this product yet since I have not received it yet. It's Los Angeles Magazine....but I haven't received a copy yet although I ordered it in April
3,"Overall it's pretty good, but there's a lot of repetition :-l","Being that LA is my favourite city anywhere, I used to always buy this at my local Borders (until they decided to no longer keep this and keep instead a thousand magazines on stitchcraft or fishing etc). Now I always look forward to picking up a couple of copies when in America. However, I find that between trips, it's only the articles that change. They still review and list the same restuarants and don't change them up as much as they probably could/should.I do love the articles about various people around town or the things going on in the city, but there is too much of the same material in various editions. I don't want to keep reading the same restaurant listings and the same advertising at the back of the magazine all the time. I agree with another reviewer that this isn't as good as the New Yorker."
3,Hello LA,"Los Angeles Magazine is a nice introduction to Los Angeles (city and county). I have had a subscription since moving to LA a few years ago. Some of the features can be repetitive and the writing isn't always wonderful, but it is a good way to learn about LA if you're not a native. The features that are fantastic make the magazine worth it the rest of the time. I really enjoyed the hiking issue. If you're interested in the food that can be found in LA or just want to keep up with what is going on in the city, Los Angeles Magazine is more than adequate."
3,decent,"This was a decent cool mist humidifier. It did what it needed to do, but I don't know if it was the water at our house or the machine but it left a residue under the top. Over all decent product. had nothing to compare it to though."
1,Piece of junk unit quit working week 4,"The unit worked well to start. After 2 or 3 weeks we had a few instances where it wouldn't turn on right away - we changed outlets and it still didn't come on. Then it came back to life, so we didn't think much of it. After 4 weeks, it would come on for a minute, and then power would shut off. It would not come back on for at least a few hours. Then it would cut right back off again. There is only a 30 day return policy from manufacturer (convenient, right!?). So, now they tell me I can send it to them in CA for repair. I have to pay shipping to CA, but they will repair and ship back for free. OK - by the time I package this thing up and ship it to CA it will come close to or exceed the purchase price. NOT a good deal. Amazon's return policy is only 30 days as well, so again, it is not worth shipping it to KY for partial credit. Throwing this piece of junk in the garbage! What a waste."
4,Cute + Affordable + Works,"Good purchase. Before buying this humidifier, I bought the Crane penguin humidifier and had to return it. The crane humidifier did not produce sufficient mist. This model works much better and is also a couple of dollars cheaper.The water tray is also much easier to clean as compared to the Crane humidifier (weird corners). Definitely this black penguin humidifier over Crane's blue penguin humidifier."
3,"Finally, a great humidifier!","This humidifier came highly recommended from my mother, who bought one for sinus issues. I wanted to get one for the same reason, and because we have a wood stove, combined with forced hot air heat, all which can be incredibly drying.My critieria was simple: no filter to deal with (been there, done that!) and no wet residue left behind. This fits the bill - the mist is cool and strong and it doesn't leave any wetness on your walls, floors, anywhere!UPDATE- used to love it, stopped working. Guess things only last a few years now."
1,Not so pleased!,"So first what's good: its cute and looks good in a child's room. Also its compact so doesn't take up much space.Now for not so good: The ""visible"" mist isn't always guranteed specially after a refill! The reason being the base stores a LOT of water and when refilled, the water in the base doesn't let the mist rise!! I have a work around of emptying the water in the base each time after a refill. It is almost a must to do so else there will be lot of water spilling outside because as I mentioned there is a LOT of water stored in the base!!!The other issue is the power indicator lights up with a delay! The first time I plugged it right out of box, it took it almost 2-3min to light up!! And I was afraid that I got a defective product!"
2,Cheap Build Quality,"I picked the SPT humidifier over a Crane because it was on sale at the time. After using the SPT for two weeks, I returned it for a Crane unit. The SPT's power indicator went out in one week, not a good sign of quality. Also, the plastics used on the SPT are very thin, I feel like I can break parts off with just a little bit of force. Lastly, the SPT unit was nosier than the Crane unit I have now. Although neither unit's noise were loud enough to bother me."
5,So far it's great,"My boys love it! It typically lasts about 2 full nights/days of use and we have used it pretty much nonstop for the past month since we purchased it. It automatically turns off if it's out of water, it doesn't knock over easily, and it is silent when running. Great purchase so far."
2,Bad Penguin!,We have had this penguin for 2 years and he has only decided to work when he felt like it. Sometimes he just won't go on....and the mist from him is minimal at best. We have not noticed any difference in room and my husband continues to get nose bleeds. The penguin has now stopped working entirely and he has been banished to the cellar.
1,"Stopped working after 6 weeks, dont buy this junk",Wont even turn on after 6 weeks. By then it was too late to ask them for a replacement. I tried many harrowing hours taking it apart and trying to see if something's loose in the power circuit. Do not buy this junk. Buy an expensive good quality one and sell it off when you dont need it.
1,PLEASE do not buy this item...! We are warning you.,PLESSE do not buy this item. the chances of it working are slim. we tried two and are not even going to send the second one back... it is in the garbage.
1,DO NOT BUY,First one was DOA. Returned and got another - again DOA. Do not buy. Will be returning and trying another brand.
5,SPT SU-3750 Humidifier,Perfect for a bedroom or small room. Quiet and does a superb job. I wish they made a 10 gallon model.
4,Useful one time,"This book is one flat laminated background with a sheet of stickers you can use to decorate the background. In theory you would be able to use it a few times, but the stickers get peeled up edges pretty quickly. Also make sure you pull the stickers out before your kid gets started or the background will be divided in half. Good for like a half hours entertainment."
3,Not their first pick.,"I purchased a few movies for my little ones, this one included. I've not watched it, but I can say that it is not the first one they pick when given a choice...or the second.....or the third. It just doesn't interest them."
5,Very concise,"I wish more books were this concise and to the point. Very deep, very interesting, and worth every penny. Not a single superfluous word in the entire book, every one of them counts.June 2008: I was just looking over my past reviews and forgot about this one. I still have this gem of a book and am going to read it again today.May 2010: I'm reading it again this morning. Every page is amazing and resounding with truth and love. It's a beautifully composed book that chops straight to the heart of life and existence."
4,Those Obnoxious Aliens keep on coming!,"Rumiko Takahashi's Urusei Yatsura is a must for Ranma 1/2, Maison Ikkoku, or One Pound Gospel lovers. This is the first video in the TV Series where Lum, our loveable, but crazy, alien appears. She wants to marry the luckless Ataru, when he only wanted to marry Shinobu. And now, Lum's family and friends start showing up... A household of crazy aliens! END"
2,Mercedes-Benz racing only.,"This video began fairly well, explaining the origins of Daimler-Benz as an automotive company in a well presented fashion. The story of the company's founders and namesakes were well presented.Then, the video began to chronicle the development of M-B racing and high performance cars exclusively. There was little about passenger cars after the early years and I felt the video should have spent far more time on M-B's main area of auto design and manufacture. As significant as the ""arrows"" and ""gull wings"" were, other M-B autos were just as important to automotive history.I was disappointed by this DVD for the above reason. If one is interested in M-B sports cars exclusively, the History Channel ""Automobiles"" series episode (available in DVD format here on Amazon) on Mercedes-Benz was certainly better in my opinion and I would recommend that DVD instead of this one."
4,Why Lamp Shades Cost So Much!,The book itself is well written and mostly easy to understand. It's the person executing the steps that could be problematic. Although helpful I believe one must have a great desire and talent in such matters. A novice shade maker may need some more basic help.
4,Very helpful,"The book gave lots of ideas, going different directions in style. Good instruction to materials and technique--but as with all things, practice is different than reading. Attention to detail while executing the task cannot be overlooked, otherwise the end shape will show it."
3,Acosta is NOT known for Top 40 trance,"This album ranks up there with History of Trance,because it contains way too many mainstream hits.Of course for newbies,this cd will open the door to the wonderful world of trance.Fans of dance will enjoy this,true trance lovers needen't get this,there is much better stuff of George's out there.Since Acosta is the world's best trance dj,I have to say that he did a damn good job mixing the tracks,especially his own ""Reeper"",which remains one of the best Acosta tracks."
2,George Acosta next level,IM A BIG FAN of George Acosta but i found this mix to be an ok mix in the middle of the mix it get dark like it drags you down the frist and the last part of the mix is awsome dont me wrong George Acosta is a good dj but i wanted more out of this cd so over all im giving it a 2 1/2 star he could have done a better mix . if you want a good cd get AWAKE or some of his resent stuff
4,"Good, but not without a bit of effort","I'll be brief since i should be working. These rings are heavy duty tools, not dainty, chintzy toys. With that in mind, you MUST grease your threads prior to installation. I also advise you to take a small round file, and make sure your screws aren't getting ""hung up"" on the just barely larger holes through which they mount. It's a fairly tight fit. Also, follow the instructions. These rings take time and effort to mount correctly. They will mount crookedly if you allow them. I don't want you to damage your scope. However, I would buy them again. They are tough, and they look great."
3,No-hassle return,"I've used Millett rings before with no problem. This time, I just couldn't get things lined up straight. Return and refund were easy and painless."
2,Too long!,"What started out to be a suspensful movie dragged in the last several episodes. I found myself begging for it to finish, and even then, the ending was very dull. My daughter and I finished the over 300 minute movie with an ""Oh, well."" We love period movies, but this one is better borrowed or rented than bought for a library. I will admit the Old Miss Haversham was the most enjoyable character to watch. I would recommend other Dickens Classics such as ""Our Mutual Friend."""
2,Not worth the money or the time.,"I agree with the other reviews about too much emphasis on the bleak, and dragging on interminably. No movement. No captivation. Unfortunately filmed in short segments, so you have to deal with opening and closing credits, etc. frequently.I did find it hard to follow the dialog with the various dialects of the characters, so I wanted to use subtitle. Alas! Subtitles are not enabled on DVDs in this series (BBC white covers). I switched from viewing the DVD via the component connection to viewing via the coax ""VCR"" connection. That allowed me to take advantage of the television's closed captioning capabilities. However, I had to sacrifice picture quality."
1,Poor quality and boring game,"The game build quality is poor. You have to spend 30 minutes punching out the cards and holders, inserting the cards into the holders, then putting the holders into the boards. Then the card holders will constantly come out of the boards, and the cards comes out of the holders.The game is also not that challenging for all but the youngest players since the character traits are not that varied."
4,What can be expected.,"Like most toys made now as opposed to when I was a child it is not a durable. The game is still the same, and my kids have fun playing with it. They are 4 and 6. My 4 year old understands it with a little help and my 6 year old was able to catch on right away. Because of their attendtion span they are only able to play about 2 or 3 times before they lose interest so the length of the game is good."
4,GUESS WHO BOARD GAME,"GUESS WHO? BOARD GAME IS A GAME OF CONCENTRATION & DEDUCTION. I THINK THE AGE COULD BE LOWERED TO 5 YEARS. IT'S A VERY, VERY ELEMENTARY VERSION OF THE CLUE GAME.NOTE: TIME CONSUMING FOR PARENTS TO PUT THE GAME TOGETHER WITH LOTS OF PUNCH OUT PAPER FIGURES & INSERTION INTO THE FRAMES."
2,Guess how Fun This Toy is!!!,"When I saw other people playing with it, I thought it was going to be tons of fun. but then when I bought it it stunk. I played it for one or two days with my brother but afterwords it's gathering dust in my closet along with Connect Four, Battleship and stuff like that. Don't get hypnotized by this toy!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!"
1,Poor construction! =(,"I remember playing this game as a child and wanted to share the fun with my children. Unfortunately, we couldn't even play it because of how poorly constructed it is. First, it comes in a million pieces - I'm not complaining about putting it together, it was kind of fun to do it with my family. However, after putting it together, it did not even work! =( The parts that flip up and down (with the faces on them) do not stay up. In addition, the ""hinges"" don't stay together very well and that makes it difficult to flip them up and down.I would buy a different version of this game next time... one that has some quality construction."
1,Falls apart,"This game needs assembled nearly every time we play. All the cards fall out, the windows fall off...annoying.After playing 5 times or so...the questions are repeated, and the fun is gone. The images are somewhat naive and unbalanced. So you run out of interesting questions."
5,Great tool for deductive reasoning!,"My 5-yr old can do this amazingly well. Really requires use of your noggin. My 4-yr old can do it with a little oversight, lots of fun."
5,"A Great toy for some fun, like on a rainy day.","This toy is not the most educational or durable, but it sure is fun! When I went to an after-school program, everyone would race to these games first, and if you didn't make it there first, you had to wait your turn, which proves how much people OTHER THAN me like it too. It is fairly durable, because the little pieces that hold the ""people"" can break somewhat easily. The educational value...well, I guess it's good for being able to determine to ""sift"" through things to get down to the right ""thing"". That is how it applys to life, not the game. The game, you try to figure out who the other person has by asking yes or no questions. Like, Does your person have brown hair? And depending on the answer, you put down the people who do or don't have brown hair. Anyway, I would recomend this toy highly!"
3,Very Poor Quality,"I am a speech-language pathologist that purchased a different version of this game years ago. It is a great educational game for teaching deductive reasoning and asking questions properly. After misplacing the older version, I purchased the version now being sold. The quality is INCREDIBLY POOR. It took forever to assemble - getting the cards into the slots is a frustrating, fidgety, time-consuming task. Then I had to use tweezers to get the counter attached. Worst of all, the pieces holding the faces are constantly falling off, even when they are being used appropriately and gently by the players. The kids I work with love this game, but they - and I - are very frustrated with having to interrupt our play because the pieces keep coming off. The older version was much sturdier and did not have these problems."
2,What happened to this timeless game?...,"First of all let me say I love and have always loved playing Milton Bradley games (as an adult, and as a child), so with that said, here's the purpose of this review. As a mother of two children I'm always trying to find new and old ways to entertain them, and now that my oldest is at the age to play board games I went and bought the classic ""Guess Who"". I can't express how disgusted I am at how cheap and so very time consuming this new and cheaper to manufacture game is. It takes more time to ""fix"" the game pieces every time the box is opened then it does to play the actual game, and as a consumer I would rather pay a few dollars more to have a better quality product (the kind of product I grew up knowing). Not everything has to change over time, and it's sad that this fine company as done just that!"
4,"kids love this game, and it's fun for adults too","My three boys all have played this game and loved it. It is one of the very few kids games that I don't dread as an adult. You can play a game within 10-20 minutes so it doesn't take a big time commitment. My kids never get bored playing.I only gave 4 stars because the game parts are not that sturdy, and the individual faces fall out sometimes. Overall, a great game."
4,Only one problem,"This game is the perfect one to describe ""family game"". The rules are simple. The questons are easy to think of. Each round is pretty quick. WHat more do you want in a game? The object of the game is to guess who your oppent picked before they guess who you picked. You ask question such as ""Does your person have a hat on?"" If they answer ""yes"" You can close all the little cards with people who dont have hats on. The drawings are detailed and funny.The only problem is the duribility...after about a month of use the little cards with the possible peoples names on them fall out. The solution? Tape them to pieces of paper and when you know they are not the correct answer, turn the card over.This game is all around fun and a great but if you have children under eight or just want a light game to play."
2,"Great concept, but poorly executed - CHEAPLY MADE","This is a really great simple game idea ideal for the little ones - my 4 and 6 year old are great fans.Only problem is that the game is so terribly made that less than 3 weeks after getting it I'm ready to throw it at the wall from frustration. It took about half an hour to pop all the little plastic and cardboard bits into place, which wouldn't be a problem except that the darn things fall off and the cardboard bits fall out constantly - breathing on this thing wrong is enough to mess it up and require a parent to have to come in and fix it. Had it not been for how cheaply made this game is, I would be heartily recommending it. Shame really, because as a concept it's a really simple and very good idea."
3,get this on sale,"I loved this game growing up, so I purchased the latest version about a month ago. I was surprised and disappointed that with a $[...] price tag through Amazon (though I actually purchased it on sale for $[...]), it required about 45 mins worth of monotonous assembly. It's made from real cheap plastic and very thin card stock -- the biggest expense for Milton Bradley must have been the box it game in. See others' reviews regarding the lack of gender and racial diversity, and the lack of features that distinguish the characters from one another. This game is a great concept that MB fails to capitalize on. I'm overall fairly disappointed, and I think it's definitely not worth full price."
3,Guess Who Grande,"Since I got this toy for Christmas, I've played it 2 times! You may not want to play with it more than twice in one day, because after a while, it gets boring! This is why I've decided to only play it once a week so I'll like the game forever!!!"
4,Recommended for speech,"Point of the game is to figure out which character you opponent has drawn. You ask questions to eliminate people. For example is it a man or woman, do they wear glasses etc.pros: our speech tutor recommended it for our son because you have to form questions to try and eliminate. I like that he has to come up with a full sentence. The kids have to use both broad questions and more specific questions.cons: Not the first game my kids would pick to play - but they will play it. The cards sometimes slip out of their slots - and it was a pain to put them all in when we first got the game."
4,The game is cute,"This game is fairly easy to set up but it seems to lose the wow within a day or two. The characters once in awhile slip out of their slots when we are trying to set up the game to play, when we try to put the characters from resting position to sitting up. It has taught my son however to reverse his thinking about what to look for in each character. It does cause children to think more. Its a simple enough game to be able to play it with a wide range of ages. It seems to travel well aswell since there is not allot of small detached pieces."
3,Not made as well,"I found the game to be not as well made as the older version. The character cards need to be taped onto the holders. Otherwise, they keep slipping out. It is a fun game and great learning for kids but cheaply made."
5,A logic game for the young 'uns,Very entertaining. A test of luck and skill; your questions must be most efficient. Good for teaching basic deductive reasoning.
4,Some original set up required !,"Parents, note that there is quite a few minutes of set up required to punch out all of the cards and thread them through the plastic holders and snap them into place. However, this is only first time set up. Also, this game is really only designed for two players, which I didn't realize. Other than that, my son loves to play it. It is good for 6 yrs & up as they need to be able to use deductive reasoning to solve the mystery. Good for young kids that like mystery chapter books like my son."
4,Kids love this game,"Bought this game for Xmas and my kids love this game. It is great because my 2 girls (7 and 5) can play a game by themselves and they play for hours. It allows them to enhance their thinking skills, trying to identify the person the other person has. They have come up with some very creative questions to ask their opponent.Also, the game takes very little time to setup and to play. 1 game may only last 5 minutes. My kids really liked this gift."
1,Piece of Junk -- Extremely Poor Quality,"My kids (ages 9 and 7) were excited to play this game after receiving it for Christmas. After at least a half hour of initial set up (punching out and assembling pieces), they played the game twice. The yellow flip pieces would fall out of their slots and the flimsy cardboard face inserts fell all over the place. I threw all the pieces back in the box and placed it on a high shelf where it will stay until I throw it out. What a waste. This game would be enjoyable and fun if it didn't fall apart."
4,Not just for kids.,"Guess Who is a game that is recommended for kids, yet all ages will have fun playing it. Guess Who is about finding out your opponents identity by asking questions about what their character looks like. Through this process, characters are eliminated till there is only one remaining.Guess Who certainly provides a lot of fun. It will help kids to think and will keep them amused at the same, making it good for educational value. Also, the game is very durable. The boards are made from pretty strong plastic and won't break easily. Also the cards that the characters are on are protected by a plastic covering and they don't get ruined easily.So Guess Who is a fun, educational and durable game that is fun for all ages."
4,The game of narrowing your choices to make an educated guess,"This is a very enjoyable game for the young and old alike. It's a game of mixing and matching.You try to figure out who the other person has. You begin by asking questions such as: ""Does this person have blonde hair? Do they have a mustache?"", etc. You narrow your choices down until you can make an educated guess on who it is!It's a lot of fun and kids will enjoy it! I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Assemble at your own risk,"After paying $16 for this game, I was very surprised that Hasbro requires their customers to complete the game construction that Hasbro chose to skip at the factory. What's the $16 dollars for? The box contains maybe $1 in flimsy materials. While my eager children waited, it took over an hour for me to assemble the game. Even then, the face cards continued to slide out of the ill-fitted slots."
4,Lots of Fun and Instructional Too!,"My 6 year old daughter loves this game! It can keep her occupied for a long time and I believe it has improved her ability to take note of details (color, shape, expression). Very good all around!"
4,A game not fully exercised,"While I have played this game for years, first with my own daughter,now with my granddaughter, I have always wondered why they don't make the game a little more challenging. First of all, there are only 6 females (which makes for a very short game if you simply ask ""is yours a girl"", second, the disbursement of those with hats, glasses, etc. is not effective. The game with the animals is fun, but people, I think, would rather play with people. Great game for kids to develop logic, reasoning,etc. But let's make it a little more challenging. Also on a final note, include more templates with which to play for the long hours that those of us with little children end up playing. Think it through! Thanks!"
4,Great game to teach with!,"I remember playing this game with my best friend when we were little, so of course I had to buy it for my son!! This game is great for little ones because it teaches them how to pay attention, look for detail, and search for clues. It's not even a hard game once you play it a time or two, and that's always great so that you don't always have to sit and read the directions every time you play the game. The only drawback to this game, is that you have to keep up with all of the pieces - we lost one of the people pieces, and so we had to sort through the other color to find that same person to take them out of the game. It would be nice to have a back up set of people pieces or something, but we know how to improvise, thank goodness :)"
3,The Original Guess Who,"There are only five girls in this game. If you pick a girl then you are at an immediate disadvantage!!! What message does this send? I'm going to have a look at the new Guess Who, it looks like there may be more characters now. Hopefully more girls. Another thing, construction is tedious and comes out very flimsy."
2,Fun game flimsy materials,I was so disappointed. I had this game for my children when they were young and they loved it. I purchased it for my grandson and when we opened it it was cardboard and plastic that you had to take apart and put together and it kept falling apart. Playing the game was no fun because the cardboard pieces of faces kept falling out of the holders and the holders didn't flip down or up all the way. It because such a trial for a 6 year old we just put it away. It was a waste of money. And of course there is no way to know before you get it and look at it.
5,Simple and Fun!,"""Santa"" brought this game for my 7 year old niece; it turned out to be her favorite gift that she received. The game uses questions of deduction to eliminate all but one of 24 characters. An excellent learning game of questioning and cognitive skills."
4,Great game for working on speech,"As a speech pathologist I am always looking for ways to teach kids skills within an ""everyday"" setting. What better than working on speech within a game? This game is great for working on asking and answering questions, problem solving and speech sounds in conversation. The most important thing is that it is fun for the kids and for me."
3,Guess Who? Board Game review,Loved this game when I was young. This is the second one we've had to buy. It is flimsy and falls apart easily. It's still fun and worth playing but frustrating to put it back together constantly.
2,VERY CHEAPLY MADE,"I got this game for my daughter for Christmas and put it together tonight. It is VERY cheaply made. The pieces that you ""flip up and down"" will not stay on, they're constantly falling off and having to fix them every ten seconds takes the fun out of the game. The concept itself is fun and great for kids, but it's sad how greedy manufacturers are these days, it could be made much better."
1,Great classic game - new version is poorly constructed,"This is a great game. I remember playing it as a kid with another child who spoke French. Lots of fun, easy to play, not determined by chance, teaches children how to group into categories and narrow down choices - wonderful.Unfortunately, the new edition is very shoddily designed. The cards are flimsy, and they fall right out of their holders when they're flipped (or sometimes when they're *not* flipped).Ultimately, the game is almost totally unplayable!This is very disappointing to all of us. I'm going to go see if I can find a vintage copy of this game, and I'll be contacting the manufacturer about this as well... though if I have an experience similar to that of a previous poster, I'll probably get brushed off."
4,Great game for two!,"My kids, all ages, loved playing this every time they visited Grandma, so, after years, we bought one for ourselves. One of the nice things is that younger kids can play with older kids, which is not always the case with games. The older kids develop strategies, of course, but the younger ones can keep up. We really enjoy it."
5,Fun for grade schoolers & parents,"My 5 & 8 year old play this game endlessly -- and it's often hard to find games that work with their age difference, so that's great. There is no reading involved for younger kids, yet it develops logic and observation skills as players exclude or include the characters.Also, the game is short enough that I can easily fit in time to play with my kids (and I enjoy it too).My only gripe is the amount of time for initial assembly. For $15 I don't expect to basically assemble the entire toy from scratch! I think it took me nearly a half hour (You have to punch out all the plastic holders & cards and then insert cards one by one in holders. But it is a one-time thing, at least. And one of the plastic hinges broke during the first week of play, but it doesn't affect play too much."
1,Cheaply made,"This would be a great game if it weren't made out of flimsy plastic. It is a pain in the neck to assemble and it constantly falls apart. The little flip-up doors don't stay hinged properly and if you don't get the little pictures inserted just-so, they fall out also. We've played it 3 times and I'm ready to throw it away. Shame on Milton Bradley for selling such a poor quality game."
2,"Fun toy, TERRIBLE CONSTRUCTION","I remember this game from my own childhood and was pleased to have it sent as a present for my own daughter for Christmas UNTIL we opened it and tried to put it together - VERY FIDDLY, took over an hour with poorly made cardboard and plastic pieces. By the time it was constructed I never wanted to look at the darn thing again. Give it 1 star because of this terrible construction. You'd think they could do better"
2,cheaply made,"This idea of this toy is GREAT! It is very educational. Teaches kids to think and form questions, stratigies. I had this toy growing up and we loved it and it was durable. My daughter got it for her 7th birthday last week and I already took it back because it is made so cheaply now. It does not stay together. A few of the piece's moldings were not straight so you can't get the pieces to stay on the main board. WHen you go to flip up all the characters usually at least 3 fall off the main board. Very frustrating."
4,Guess Who durability?,"I remembered using this game w/ kids many years ago--it was their favorite and was used frequently w/out any problems. It is also a great game to work on focus and reasoning. I purchased it this time and one of the frames was defective, which meant that I had to order another frame from Hasbro (which they are kindly sending free of charge). I have used it several times with my patients and each time, some of the individual frames become unhinged and the flow of the game is interrupted (then it works on frustration tolerance!). It is my hope that increased usage will result in a little more durability. I don't remember having this problem with the one used all those years ago."
4,Great Game - Patience and Assembly Required,This is a great game. The idea is simple and fun. Encourage some analytical thinking for the kids. Very affordable.Somewhat frustrating is the initial assembly required. It will take at least 15 to 20 minutes to finish setting up the game. You will need to manually remove each card and insert to each individual holders. You may also need to use additional transparent tape so they won't slide down. Construction of the plastic is not very sturdy.
5,Wild Bird Rescue,We rescue an average of 1000 birds a year and we owe a lot of our success to Robert Stroud. We use all his methods and we average about a 12 percent loss in our birds. He is our mentor and we have proven his methods work. The national rate for losses in wild birds is 33 percent we have averaged out to 12 percent. If you don't buy and then use Stroud's methods you will loose out.
5,Life Has No Ceiling : A Romance Of Changing China,A wonderful book. Readers will be given a look into the story of the Cheng family and life in China during those years. I would highly recommend.
4,suggeested by our piano teacher,"We bought these as they were recommended by our piano teacher, she seemed to think theses were the best for young children and they were much cheaper on Amazon than any brick and mortar store"
3,Not my child's favorite piano book,"This book is for someone with a previous knowledge of written music, since this is not my daughter's case, she thought it was too dificult for her. Maybe once she learns to read music this will be a great book, for now however, since she likes another book I bought with a much different approach to teaching piano, she doesn't even want to try this one."
4,Like the series,"I just started my 6 year old on part 1, but ordered part 2 at the same time. love part 1. I've never taught piano lessons, but it's easy to figure out what should be taught by what's on the page...I'm sure I'll love part 2 next."
1,Missing pages,This is a fine reprinted book until you almost get to the end and find the last two pages missing. For the money it is not worth it.
5,Ana Juan's 'The Night Eater' is not scary and sure to please the little ones,"I purchased this book not only out of a desire to check out more Ana Juan and add a picture book by a leading Hispanic author-illustrator to my Spanish classroom, but because the cover illustration was so fantastically and creepily alluring. After having read the book with a number of children, I highly recommend it, for Juan's breathtakingly beautiful and dreamy artwork if nothing else. But the story is entertaining and endearing in its own right, following the trials and tribulations of the title character, whose daily duties eating up the stars and darkness in order to make way for the day leave him embarrassingly overweight and ashamed. He makes a decision to suspend his night-eating, which leads to all sorts of unwanted outcomes."
2,Not for me,"I don't get it. It's one of those magazines that you should be able to pick up for free in front of your local pizza place or bar. There are a lot of ads for Orange County plastic surgeons and dating services; if you're looking for either of those, this ones for you."
5,GREAT WONDERFUL HAPPY EXPERIENCE,"I LOVE THE PRICE, THE SERVICE AND THE TIME IT TOOK TO GET IN MY HANDS, GREAT JOB."
2,Needs a rewrite with more Dunaway,"This is yet another vehicle starring Faye Dunaway that did not fully utilize her incredible talent. Who needs Lara Flynn Boyle when you have Faye Dunaway? Miss Dunaway was not in enough scenes, though she's looking good. They should have ditched the Flynn Boyle character and had Timothy Hutton fall in love with Dunaway. People start to die mysteriously, and he's not sure if it's Dunaway. She could do a couple of scenes where she acts nuts and you're not sure if she's guilty. In the end, it turns out to be jealous women in her office trying to frame her to get Timothy Hutton to ask them out. Dunaway and Hutton run off together in the end. That is is a much better story and would have showcased Dunaway much better. Otherwise, the action was good."
4,THE TEMP FROM HELL,"Having worked in an environment where temporary employees were utilized, THE TEMP offers a sardonic look at one such temp whose ambitious goals elevate her to a rather auspicious position. I have always enjoyed Lara Flynn Boyle's work; her performance on TWIN PEAKS was always worth watching. She chews up this role deliciously, without going over the top; Faye Dunaway looks great (even ten years ago), and she reigns in her potentially campy performance with a vengeance; Timothy Hutton does well in a role he is used to playing--the misunderstood underdog. The movie builds to a pretty good climax, and then unfortunately deflates it with a rather weak ending.But, getting there is fun and this movie works in its oft-abused genre."
3,... it's a bargain,"well the casting is good. boyle looks great. hutton does his EMOTIONALLY SCARRED role good (again). and faye dunaway to boot? trying to kill and screw her way to the top, temp harrington excels as a natural born liar who is able to respond effectively to any confrontation. I really liked that element of realism. We've all met people like that. There are some clever killings, and a memorable dismemberment. such of a happy ending as hutton's character finds confidence and authority in his capture of a crook. slick and glossy. sexy in a sick way."
3,Just look at it in fun,"Not to be taken serious...........look at Lara's hairstyles throughout. At times she has is way bigger than her body. Like Cousin It when she jumps into a pool. Full of goofy dialogue and plot holes galore, just take this trashy movie in fun. Don't analize."
3,"The Temp is ""Killer"".","Gulity Pleasure..Not a thriller, nor a comedy, not film noir nor oscar winner just pointless fun, I get a kick out of these films that dont take things seriously, ""The Crush"" w/ Alicia Silverstone is another!"
4,Automated Lighting Programming Made Easy,"The tips, tricks and techniques have been invaluable for both conventional and moving lighting programming. An excellent purchase for anyone interested in a more organized production. Very well organized, and generalized to facilitate programming virtually any console or utilizing any instrument.While specific manufacturers are mentioned, they are not covered in great detail. This book is a wonderful suppliment to any programmers library, but cannot replace a thourough understanding of console syntax that is only obtained through expereience and reading console system manuals."
4,"Competent, but a bit thin...","Buying this book to expand my knowledge into this area, I found it a bit thin. It feels stretched to me - like a padded long article. The info about cue types was good, but I'm sure it's covered in user manuals, and the insistence on avoiding mention of specific products diluted the rest of it too much for my liking. I think picking a console and fixtures, even if it's one per chapter, would allow a little more detail. As it is, readable, but unsatisfying.Certainly room for another edition, hopefully with more detail. I should note that I'm not a beginner, I've been programming other aspects of shows for decades. Possibly a beginner would get more out of it. I gave it more stars because it covers the exact topic I was looking for."
2,Not Much info on Programming,I am an intermediate programmer looking to expand his knowledge. I was looking for a lot more out of this book. It doesn't tell you too much about programming Automated Lights. Let me sum up what the book did tell me: Save your show!
4,Another candidate for remastering,"A favorite film too (as Donat's tend to be, and as Dietrich's too) with decent-enough video-quality that justifies the purchasing. And another candidate for a remastering effort."
4,Great system,"The filing system is very helpful and I'm very happy w/ it. It takes a bit of time to set up, but it makes it a lot easier to file."
2,Need to buy a hanging file and hanging folders,"""Once you set up your kit, you just slip in new papers as they come. No more waiting until you can find the time to file"".This is not true. Although it is nice looking and includes a 48 page booklet explaining how to set up your files with quick-find index it is not what I was looking for. There were no mention in the Amazon ad about buying a hanging file/folder. I thought it was a booklet file. So that is disappointing."
5,A great find...,"I happened upon this book in a library sale, and so glad I picked it up! The prose in this book is astoundingly gorgeous....poetry.The details of everyday life in the period are vast, it's all intertwined in a bitter marriage and life of John Milton...told through his wife who was forced into marriage with him at 16...2 temperments so unsuited to one another. She loved another.You'll love this gem of a book. I am surprised it is not more well known."
3,"Not half bad, really","Geoff Dyer says in Out of Sheer Rage that the best analysis of art is by other artists, not by critics, and by that yardstick, Wife to Mr Milton is pretty interesting, as it's an exegesis of John Milton by Robert Graves, himself no slouch of a poet, and an awfully good novelist. If you read this after reading Paradise Lost, you'll recognize in the character of John Milton the creator of God, Jesus Christ and Adam from Paradise Lost, but you won't get a feeling for the creator of the finest character in it, Satan, or, for that matter, Eve. In other words, the sexist intolerant John Milton is well represented; the John Milton who understands anguish and vanity and envy is not. Still, W to MM is an awfully good summary of the English Civil War, at least for one, like me, who has never been able to make heads or tails of it, and it has well drawn characters in the eponymous narrator and her parents. It's not gripping, although it's often amusing."
4,Great Account of the West,"If you or someone you know is interested in the real life of the cowboy- not the hollywood version- this is a great read! Very understated and forward, and as far as I can tell, the real deal about what life was like- a lot of these men have passed away leaving only stories handed down to their children and grand children- most of whom never put anything in writing. As someone who grew up with these families and men, I can honestly say its probably as close as you can get to what life was like and what it took to build the west."
3,We Pointed Them North,A good look at the life of a cowboy in Montana and Wyoming in the late 1800's. Not politically correct by any stretch. Not very well put together but a very interesting read.
4,A great read. Great stories.,"I very much enjoyed this book. A very conversational style. The parts about Billy the Kid (a small portion of the book) seem a little out of place and forced, because they are not first person accounts, like the rest of the book. Those parts are interesting, just not as engaging as his first-person accounts. I enjoyed that he tells the reader that his motivation in writing is to make a few bucks!"
4,Page Turner,I purchased this book for research purposes. I was surprised to find it so engrossing - a real page turner!
3,A true story of a man who used the gifts God gave him.,"Eric Liddell was (and still is) a shining example of what a person can do if he will use the gifts God has given him/her. It is too bad that this book did not live up to the potential that it could have been. There was not enough documentation of events, and the author used descriptions of Eric and events in his life that possibly were misleading, ie. ...but the thinly veiled criticism in the press turned to sensational acclaim when Eric entered-and won-a race for which he was completely untrained... Anyone who knows the story knows that Eric knew of his being in the 400 meters months in advance of the Olympics. True enough, it was quite a fantastic feat,however, over-sensationalism only lends weakness to this great story."
2,A true story of man who knew what is the right thing to do.,"An inspiring true story ruined by bad writing. Is this book written for children? Did the author do any research because there is no souce documented. Anyhow, this is still a wonderful true story."
2,Disappointing account of a godly man,"Poor writing and condescending (if not racist) attitudes toward the Chinese ruined this book. It was recommended as a language arts book for my 8th grader, but I will not let her read this account. Eric Liddell comes across as a cardboard figure in this book. I will look for another book that will do justice to the story of Eric Liddell's life and his faith in God."
3,????,if you like trina checvk this cd out I heard better soundtracks where the hell is Ice Cube he's the star why is'nt any of his cuts on here?
1,Not for young jwomen,I've read reviews and thought that Mariue Claire would be better than Cosmo (it's all about sex in Cosmo) but I'm dissapointed. Marie claire is like in style the whole magazine is just a photos of models and advertisments. There are maybe 2 or 3 articles but they are not so interesting. All in all if you are in your twenties you should choose cosmo or glamour.
5,great magazine with lots of interesting articles,one of my favorite magazines. It's not just a lot of fluff. there are great tips and articles inside too!
4,Interesting Articles,Marie Claire does a good job of providing interesting articles. I like that their fashion sections usually do have affordable (under $100) suggestions from stores where I shop.
2,Eh,Barely worth the $5 trial price. No plans on renewing subscription. Tired of magazines where ads out number content by almost 2 to 1!
3,Ups and down,"This magazine has its good and bad issues which happen every month so it's hard to grade. I do like the new ""work"" feature they added though. Especially November 2012 article regarding taking a leadership role in the workplace."
2,"Received my first issue of Marie Claire, not very impressed.",To me the magazine is nothing but picture advertisements. Will not be renewing. Not happy at all with my purchase. I'm just glad that it was a combo magazine purchase. Hopefully the other magazines will make it worth my money!
2,Marie Claire,"Got this magazine fairly inexpensive, or I would not ordered it. After a year daughter decided she did not want to keep getting it, so cancelled it."
5,"Great price, fast order processing","I am impressed with the quick processing of this order. I ordered on 12/30/08 and received my first issue on 1/30/09. (I didn't think I would receive my first issue until March at best!) I also took advantage of a great Amazon deal, so the cost for my full year subscription was $5-$8 (I ordered three magazines, so I don't recall the exact price on this one). Based on this experience, I would order a magazine sub through Amazon again."
2,Irrelevant and disappointing,"The writers and editors of Marie Claire seem to be out of touch with what is actually important. The articles seem irrelevant and immature at times, which is sad because I'm 24. This is just another caddy womens magazine. I am very disappointed because I had expected more. With that said, I will not be re-newing my subscription after the year is up."
4,A little bit of Cosmo with a little bit of politics & fashion,"I have been a subscriber for 3 years. Specifically I have been getting Cosmo/Marie Claire combo subscription for $20. If not for that I don't know if I would read Marie Claire. I prefer Cosmo, but I do like Marie Claire. I like their feature stories & their reviews of best music/books/DVD every month. A good read. It's true that now you can get it for $5 a year. I'm not a big magazine person, but I like this one."
2,crap,I really like the magazine but the renewal doesnt work out as well as you would expect it. Having paid Sept. 2 they say I will not recieve my renewal until Feb 2011. WTF? I renewed when you said because I didn't want to miss an issue....and no customer service line. F-that.
2,Very Poor Customer Service,Very disappointing! Ordered this as a gift for a friend and was promised that it would arrive in four to six weeks. After double that time....still nothing!
4,No complaints,"Started receiving my issues a few weeks after I ordered them and there's been no problems, just a great deal!"
1,"The trashiest of ""fashion"" magazines - not for nice girls","I'm a kuhlmom. I like fashion. I like make-up and nail polish. I like to be up on the latest real world trends. This magazine covers very few of those things. Readers will find instead, trashy, poorly written articles about issues that are frankly, morally corrupt and offensive. Contained within this ecological waste of trees, one would find a barrage of articles about promiscuous sex involving orifaces that I prefer not to ponder in that context. I have received this magazine for several months and have found nothing of value in any of them. The website wouldn't allow me to cancel by my name. I finally remembered to snag the wrapping in time to enter my subscription number into the ""cancel my subscription section"". I'll sleep better tonight knowing I won't be traumatized by another issue."
3,Loved it... then...,"I have been a subscriber to Marie Claire for a while now. I used to love getting it in the mail to read the new articles about real women and to peruse the beauty and fashion advice. Now, since the new editors, the fashion has gone from affordable items to ""price available upon request."" I find it frustrating and irritating that at least a couple items on every spread have this ""price tag."" Especially for a magazine that is written in a city full of H&Ms;, etc. And a tag line of ""27 new hairstyles, trends, products"" is no where near 27 new hairstyles, trends and products. I believe it was 5.I hope one day Marie Claire will come back down to planet middle income, but until then, I am moving on..."
2,Not the greatest,There were way too many ads and not enough valuable content -- in fact many of the features were repetitive and seemed recycled. I'd prefer Bust magazine.
4,Gift,"I got this as a gift for my aunt, she seems happy with the renewal every year. I haven't had any complaints of shipping delays and believe me she would let me know."
3,Better than Elle and Baazar,"For being a fashion magazine, this one actually has articles worth reading. I purchased all 3 magazines when they were $5 each and this is the only one I did not cancel. There are several magazines I like better than this one, but this one is okay. I can actually stand to look at it."
4,3 years of MC,this is the third year that I renew Marie claire. I like it because it has a little bit of every thing. I wanted fashion but I was tired of those magazines that only had stuff that I could never buy. Marie claire has fashion and other very interesting stuff to read to.
1,offensive,"i ordered this magazine for my classroom's SSR. after their continued support of maura kelly's blog about the tv characters mike and molly, i am so offended. discontinued subscription, will never subscribe again."
1,Never received my subscription,I had ordered Marie Claire with Amazon on 11/08/09 and still have not received my subscription. I am having second thoughts in ordering magazines with Amazon again
3,Too Young For Me,"I ordered this magazine as a way to inspire me to lose weight. However it was the wrong thing. It is way too young - geared for no one older than 30 and that may be pushing things. Lots of ads, lots of skinny young blondes, teeny bopper stuff. I share this magazine with younger coworkers at my job."
1,NEVER AGAIN ! BUYER BEWARE.,"DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE! FOR ANY PRICE, IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE. MARIE CLAIRE HAS HARASSED ME REPEATEDLY TO PAY FOR MY SUBSCRIPTION. IT WAS PAID FOR IN ADVANCE THRU AMAZON. I HAVE SENT THEM COPIES OF MY AMAZON RECEIPT TWICE. THEY ARE REPORTING ME TO A CREDIT AGENCY FOR NON-PAYMENT. AVOID THEM, AVOID THEM. THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS AND WILL FALSELY AND WITH MALICE DESTROY YOUR CREDIT RATING."
5,Marie Claire Subscription,What a deal. You cannot beat a one year subscription to Marie Claire Magazine for $5. I love it.
4,Great Articles,"This magazine has great articles, every thing from sex to women's rights issues. It keeps you up to date on the fashions and then shows you how you can do it with out breaking the bank. This is one magazine that I get every month and read from cover to cover."
1,This magazine SUCKS!,"The magazine articles are okay, they do not have stories on mixed cultures. The whole magazine focus on Caucasian not mixed cultures. This magazine only catered to Caucasians. Sorry never get this magazine at all."
1,Where is it?,"I ordered this November 27, and still have not seen any magazine show up. And according to Amazon's eta it should have started a month ago...Always fun to pay something for nothing."
2,magazine subscription,I do not recommend buying magazine subscriptions from Amazon. I subscribed to this magazing through Amazon on 3/31. It has been almost 2 months and I still haven't received any copies of this magazine.
1,I asked for this to be cancel!,"I asked for the cancelation of this title? Please, do not sent anymore, and credit my account! Thank you."
4,A Fashion Mag with Class,"I have just recently begun to read Marie Claire regularly, and I must say that it is refreshing compared to most other magazines. In the past I had to buy several magazines to cover what I wanted to know, but MC covers fashion (including both high priced items as well as items that a poor college kid can afford-a big plus since this is a large market for beauty mags) and it also covers important issues from around the world. Although I wish it had a little more on fitness and health it still keeps me coming back to the newsstand every month."
2,Who's Marie Claire?,I ask 'who Marie Claire is' because I haven't received a regular monthly delivery. I love the magazoine itself but I don't like not getting it when it's expected. Years ago when I was getting all the 'chic magazines' they would be in my mailbox at what seemed ahead of time. I'm seeing the magazine on the rack in the store before it hits my door. I was used to getting my magazines before they showed up in stores.
1,2 Months and Still No Magazine,I ordered this magazine for my daughter going on 2 months now and we still have not received the first issue. I have sent 2 e-mails to Amazon without any response. Easier jsut to buy at the drug store. Amazon has had my money for 2 months now - paid for 2 years in advance - i must be crazy.
4,Nice Magazine,"I like this magazine, it has fashion, it has interesting articles, health and fitness, celebrities, it has a little bit of everything."
3,I think the quality has gone downhill...,"I used to LOVE this magazine. It was for real women and was inspiring, but now it is like all the other high ad, high fashion magazines out there. The ads and fashion part of the magazine has increased and the REAL articles have decreased; very sad. If I wanted a fashion magazine, I would subscribe to the other highly known fashion magazines."
4,How Many More Times (will I love this magazine)?,"I can't believe I am saying this, but Marie Curie saved MY marriage. We were going through one of those ""rough-patches"" and my life partner remarked: ""Do we have what it takes?"" I turned to him/her and said, ""let's take that quiz."" We did. Several times. The 4th time around, we marked our multiple choices answers and nervously awaited. We made some juice (that Black and Decker...now there's a mate you can Depend on!) and talked it over. We decided to stay together for the kids. Now, every-time we take a trip to see them, we bring our favorite magazine. Thanks! Highly rec'd!"
1,Canceled the subscription,"I enjoyed Marie Claire for more than two years, but recently canceled the subscription over the Maura Kelly blogging incident. What I had liked about Marie Claire is that I felt they tried to embrace the diversity of all women (with mixed results sometimes, but still), but after the editors refused to refute the blatant bigotry and hateful rhetoric toward overweight people, I decided that I could not longer believe the magazine supported the beauty of diversity.As for the subscription, I will say that I never had a problem with receiving my copies -- they were generally on time to the best of my knowledge."
1,Did not recuive not one number so far....,"Very hard to say anything as nothing was delivered as of yet.Mabye it can be double checked,not sure if it will come on kindel or it will be delviered to adress given."
1,Why havent I received an issue,I love this magazine however the customer service on this subscription is lacking speed I subscribed to two other magazines on the same invoice and I have reveived two issues of teh other magazines and NOT a single one to Marie Claire WHY I DON KNOW.
2,Not the average woman,It full of very high cost items that the average woman can't afford. There are so many other magazines that is so much better. I will not be renewing.
1,Never Again!!!,"After purchasing this magazine subscription I was advised it wouldn't get delivered till mid - end june (this was a gift for my sister). I got an email to state it had been cancelled so i contacted amazon, who advised i need to contact the publisher in which i did, only to receive another email from the publisher saying to contact amazon. The subscription was cancelled before it was meant to start however i did not get a full refund. After emails back and forward to amazon and the publisher i have given up, but unfortunately will not purchase anything more through amazon because of this incident."
5,Free Stuff,"With such a huge choice of fashion magazine out there today, I will be honest when I say the first thing that hooked me into Marie Claire was their monthly offer for free stuff! Sometimes it's makeup, panties, or skin cream, I am hooked even when the free thing is unobtainable (occasionally you have to go to a certain store to get your free thing).Another column that I enjoy in Marie Claire, being on a limited budget and all, is the Splurge vs. Steal beauty page. Usually found near the end of the magazine it is full of various expensive beauty items and their prices along side a very similar inexpensive item."
1,Never a big fan...,"Marie Claire's editors allowed the hateful blog denigrating overweight people to be posted, they have left it on the website, they have taken no action against the author, and they have not made any meaningful apology or response. There are many other magazines to choose from - will stick with Glamour!"
1,Not a fan,"I'm not sure exactly who the intended audience is for this magazine but apparently it's not middle class women in their mid-20's. If I or any of my friends followed the fashion advice in this magazine, we'd be broke! If you can afford to buy $400 blouses and $600 sweaters, it might be an ok choice for you. There are tidbits here and there that I found helpful in the magazine but those were few and far between. Overall, the issues of this magazine that I received were not appealing at all."
2,A Simple Review,"This magazine used to be good...but now, it is boring...the interviews are boring...I don't even bother reading them, they seem to mainly just tell you a couple things about what the person they are interviewing is doing at the time...what they are wearing, and ask a few questions...I cancelled my subscription too...there are TONS of ads!!! Ads take up most of the magazine! The only clothes they recommend...are usually more than $100. So unless you want a magazine that is mainly ads(I swear they take up more than the actual stuff they write about!)I would NOT recommend this magazine to anyone! The things I did like about it, just seem to have disappeared."
3,OK FOR THE PRICE...,"I got this for $5 so the price was good. But had I reviewed it in the store first I would not spend regular prices on this magazine. It is OK to thumb through like most have said but it is NOT a great magazine. I cant tell what ""AGE"" it is for. I cant see many people in their 20's or 30's affording clothes in there...not real people especially... so I am guessing it is geared for rich celeb types that have money to burn. So far I have seen one article that I may read... but mostly ads in this. It is OK for the price but I wont berenewing the subscription. It did come in 4 weeks though for the first issue."
4,Marie Claire,"Great magazine for womens issues. The fashion is fun and trendy, as go for the makeup tips. My only complaint is that I feel that Marie Claire's lists of makeup and clothing recommendations always the same color. ex: blue container on mascara, blue nail polish, light blue scubbing cream. The same list items will be found in next months issue except the products will be all yellow, or red... you get the idea. Is this coincidence, or a suggestion from the art director."
4,MarieClaire,i really enjoy this magazine. This has lost of articles of fashion. A few pages of gosspis and advice. but it is mainly a fashion magazine. Definatly for a fahionista. :)
5,Great magazine!,I recommend this magazine for anyone in their twenties and thirties. Lots of variety and keeps my interest.
3,"even for five dollars a year this is *still* just ""OK""","My first subscription issue came with the following on the cover/in the contents:238 hot new looks, touting ""fab finds under $100""; what I found more often inside was clothing with the caption ""price available on request""A lengthy article about Angela Jolie; sorry, but...yawn....Big Girl in a Skinny World; a article telling big girls how lucky they are to be able to at least by *some* cute shoes/boots.For five dollars a year I am not going to complain *too* hard but not likely to renew this either."
3,"Cheap subscription, but nothing cheap about recommendations inside","The main reason I subscribed to Marie Claire was the price. Five bucks for a whole year during a special? Not bad, not bad at all. That and the fact I love Project Runway and having it mentioned five times an episode really hooks it in your mind. It took about a month for the first issue to arrive and I immediately dove in. A lot of the stuff is pricey and to be honest, I am not going to buy a $500 must own jacket. I can't even afford the bargain version at $100. Marie Claire might not be as crammed full of pricey things as In Style, for instance, but it's not a great magazine for a bargainista like myself.Seeing as how I have eleven more issues coming, maybe I'll see something more my style (and price range), but so far, I'm honestly disappointed."
4,its great deal,I order this magazine to learn more about fashion stuff.Magazine is exquisite. Its also a good deal.
4,great magazine,I really like this magazine. It has alot of interesting articles and topics. Plus I like the fashion in it.
4,Still better than most women's mags,Still think that Marie Claire is a cut above most women's magazines.
2,The fashion is runway style,"The clothes in this magazine people would never wear in ""real life"". The clothes are very expensive, some around $600 for a skirt! I have recieved my third issue and don't think I am going to read it."
2,Have Not Received Yet,"I've been waiting for some time for this to start, and at this point am ready to ask for a refund, since it appears that the subscription doesn't include any actual issues."
3,The Magazine Diva Says........,"I enjoy Marie Claire but they could ""step it up"" a bit. Splurge vs. Steal probably sells their magazine for them. Often I notice repeat information, or feature products that appear in 4 other fashion magazines. More originality would be helpful. And it really pissed me off that the fengshui article was such a limited target market. (I'll still read next month's addition. I have to find out the best ""steal""!)"
1,NEVER SHOWED UP,Someone dropped the ball - this never arrived 8 months later. Maybe you shouldn't get it through Amazon?
1,Absent subscription!,"I ordered this subsciption in June, and it's now mid-September....I have yet to see a single magazine."
3,Not Quite What I Thought It Would Be,"This book, lavishly illustrated, better serves the home, condo, co-op owner than the renter. Too many tips call for structural changes or renovations not allowed in rentals. Like many such books, I don't think the authors really know what a small bathroom is and that most apartment kitchens are the Pullman type.I am always looking for strategic ways to shelve books. This is addressed; however, the solution is to have shelves above doorways, up to the top of a two story room for example. This is fine if you only want to refer to the books when you move in or out of your dwelling. I want the books accessible. Also in kitchens, many of the ""space savers"" left you with no clear counter space.I gave the book three stars because I think it is well formatted and has an unusual number of color illustrations. I do not think it is too practical for the average user."
3,"Shabby, not very chic","I disagree with the reviewer who said this book is better for the home owner. I think this book was definitely made with the very-small-budget person in mind. Every room is furnished with things you could find very cheaply on craigslist or the random stuff you have accumulated over the years. Unfortunately, the overall aesthetic in this book is more shabby than chic in my opinion. There is, however, lots of advice on how to maximize your space in every room.I would recommend other, better ""Small spaces on a budget"" books out there."
5,It's about time!,"This is my very favorite album of all-time. Incredibly, it hasn't been available until the end of 2002! The music is wonderful and the sound quality is outstanding. Bonus tracks are well-selected too. Country rock at its best!"
2,WOW I'M SHOCKED,"WELL FIRST LET ME SAY, I LOVE HEX, THE MAN IS A GREAT DJ!!! I HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF HIS MATERIAL, HE IS THE MAN; HOWEVER I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS THINKING WHEN HE RELEASED THIS ALBUM, BUT I HAVE TO SAY I AM NOT FEELING THESE VIBES AT ALL.I KNOW NOT EVERONE CAN HAVE A HIT, BUT THE MUSIC DOESN'T EVEN SOUND LIKE HEX HECTOR. I REALLY HOPE HIS NEXT ONE IS BETTER. I PROBABLY HAVE LISTENED TPO THIS CD MAYB 3X. MY FAV SONG IS TRACK #1 WHICH IS A SLOWER DANCE GROOVE RATHER THEN HIS OTHER MIX WHICH IS ALOT MORE DANCIER [IF U WILL]....BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!!!"
3,"Go with the ""Original"" memory game","This is a cute idea, but frankly the pictures are far too similar for a pre-schooler just starting out. Go with the original Memory game and call it a day."
2,I miss the old memory games...,"Unfortunately, the cards aren't as durable as the memory games of old. And holy man, there are a ton of cards! I'm sure that is great with smaller kids, but once they get mixed up, try to sort out a few for your young toddler just learning matching!The problem I found was that it has too many cards for smaller children, and bigger kids aren't as interested. So this one will be put on the shelf for a while, hopefully won't spill, and will be taken out at just the right moment to hold my daughter's interest (Yeah right???)"
2,Very hard....,"I bought this game for my 3 year old son, and it is so hard!! My husband and I tried playing it with him, and it was difficult even for us. Many of the cards have the same characters, so it is hard to remember, ""Was that Tigger on a pogo stick, or Tigger on a swing?"".... I don't have the orignal Memory Game, but am considering buying it instead."
3,Not what I expected,We decided to buy my daughter a memory game and we bought this one and we tried to play it with her many times but it was too confusing for her. There are too many cards to lay down so we would have to use less than half of them to make it simple for her and the pictures had the same characters and some of the pictures looked similar and she got confused because she thought she had a match and she didn't and got frustrated so she quit asking to play it.
2,Overpriced and under fun,"This game is less than thrilling, much less than thrilling for my granddaughter who usually loves memory games. The pieces are small with pictures that are hard to distinguish one from another and it is made out of cardboard. At half the price, you would get what you paid for. Give this toy a miss!"
2,Hard going!,I got partway through this book and started to wonder just WHAT the author was taking while he was writing it!It is a disjointed history that darts around all over the place dropping names that appear to have little relevance to the main story. Whats more its poorly proofed - I started to spend more time trying to pick the spelling mistakes and incorrect words than read the content.Sorry a big yawn!On the other hand the pictures are very interesting - thats what gives this tome 2 stars!
1,Slow and boring read - wish I hadn't purchased,This is not what I was expecting at all. The author is way way toowordy and never really gets to the point - no recollections of Studio 54 as promised and is not concerned with getting the reader involved in the story - really boring and not recommended at all.
2,Comprehensive but lacking,"I agree with what other reviewers have said about this book; there is so much emphasis on the financial scandal of the club that it overshadows the content about what was going socially and culturally. I bought this book thinking it would be entertaining and full of antics and memories of people who had frequented the club; I thought it would be more of a reflection on ""the culture of the night"" as the title mentions. Instead, it was dry and detail-oriented only in areas that bored me; finance, real estate, etc. Plus the author himself seemed insistent on mentioning himself in the book, which I found egotistical and desperate."
3,An okay read.,"I purchased this book as soon as it came out. It's okay. The book discusses Studio 54 a bit, but also addresses other discos. The photos are few. There are some interesting tidbits discussing the rise of disco (its appeal and timing) and its inevitable fall (being too kitschy to sustain itself). If you're a die hard disco fan like me and devour any and everything concerning disco, you'll come away from this book feeling that you know a little more. For the rest of you, you'll probably regard it as a waste of money."
2,Outdated Dance Techno Songs,"Well, its just older night club hits. Kind of out dated. Nothing main stream. Ok songs, buy if your in the mood"
3,not the best,"Classic albums from 70s contain much better production, more interesting arrangements and better songs than this album. This album is OK, but it simply doesn't have the soul of classic forro LPs."
3,Nice gloves,"These gloves are nice to work in, they're comfortable and as durable as a ""not leather"" glove can be. However, I found that they have gloves, comparable to these, at lowes for half the price. I'm not sure that these particular gloves are worth $20."
2,Nothing flashing at this piano,"Sure. I was tempted by the ""flash"" that would accompany my ability to make music at the piano. So many folks share that dream. You'd think with he convenience of the dvd, and the full set, my mission would be accomplished.The author, who plays very well, indeed, simply has not broken down the skills needed. OK, we don't want years of lessons at THIS point! But the shortcut method of ""chording"" didn't get me near where I wanted to be.Don't despair if this didn't work for you. Just try another adult method, maybe from a publisher like Kjos or Alfred, who have books geared for beginning adults. The chording short-cut is fine if you have a really good ear, can read music well enough, and have a steady sense of rhythm. Otherwise, you'll end up frustrating yourself, wondering why it doesn't sound better, and not knowing what to do to make it sound better"
2,"DVD is NOT ""User Friendlly""","I just received this DVD and can't really give it a content rating yet. I did want to chime in regarding the difficulty of using this DVD.Several reviewers have mentioned that they couldn't pause, rewind or fast forward their DVD, while others have said their DVD didn't have ""chapter"" markers, and at least one person claimed their DVD ""worked perfectly"". My copy of this DVD will move through chapters, but will not pause, rewind or fast forward.So, although the recording quality of the DVD seems acceptable, the functionality of the DVD is very poor and will probably result in an overall lower rating than I might have given it if it wasn't such a struggle to maneuver through the lessons.If I manage to make it to the end of the DVD despite my current frustration, I will post another rating for content."
3,"Too much gab, drags out basic content",Based on the PBS presentation of this program and as a non-classic pianist myself I find the author spends too much time reiterating and interjecting non-essential gab to get to a basic point. You almost get the impression that he likes to hear himself speak(rather than teach). Not to say that you will not get to the purpose of the presentation. I like what the author has to say and agree with most of his concepts as to basic chord piano approach to learning to play. There are better programs available out there and available online which I feel are richer in content and more rewarding.
1,WAY TOO MUCH TALK,"I SAW THIS ON PBS AND THIS GUY TALKS ON AND ON AND ON AGAIN,VERY LITTLE INSTRUCTION. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY SOMETHING DON'T GET THIS ONE .p.s. some video's like this one have a type of anti piracy encoding that blocks it playing on PC's and I guess buy the G5 users comment same goes for MAC because most piraters rip dvds with their computer, but for a learning dvd this is unacceptable this guy spent more time on the video graphics than on educating.His approach is like a salesman's he is trying to make you believe how great he is rather than just being great."
2,Slick but pithy,"Well, the most I can say is that it will teach you a few tricks for playing chords along with a simple melody line, like found in fake books. Scott is a slick performer and he makes his examples sound good, but his method is adaptable to only a limited style and tempo of playing. This DVD is a companion to his book of the same title. Both the book and the DVD are overpriced for what they contain, in my opinion. A much better choice would be ""How to Play the Piano Despite Years of Lessons"", also available from Amazon."
1,Don't Buy Houston's DVD's,"I wanted to learn the basics of playing an electronic keyboard I recently acquired. I frequently watch Houston's TV show on satellite and subsequently purchased all three of his DVD's, (1) Play Piano in a Flash; (2) Tips and Tricks Volume I; (3) Tips and Trick Volume II. With the exception of his repeated focus on the chords of C, F, and G, there is very little to learn from these DVD's. I wasted $90 to watch something I learned on line for free. Don't waste your time and money buying these videos, they are horrible. Much of the video content is nothing more than video clips from various shows with featured guests. In my opinion, Houston should be ashamed of himself for selling these under the guise of a learning process."
1,"One Video, Money Ill Spent","I purchased the authors book, same title, and found it to be less than informative, so... after reading a review of the author's DVD, and how difficult it is to watch and play along, I decided the video set (doesn't ""set"" imply more than one of something?)would be better, as I could rewind and review easily. The information contained was available free on PBS, and the additional 80 minutes claimed seems to be a reselling of how his system teaches.The video is a low quality recording and certainly not worth the money."
2,Too much talk,"This DVD would have been a good one if Scott Houston would have played more of the examples. He talks 98% of the time the other 2% he plays. He states on the DVD that He knows that everyone wants to sit down and play the piano, and they don't want to learn all the music theory and do piano excercises. His approach is to sit down at the piano and start playing songs from the very beginning. With him saying all that on the DVD, he never really plays. He spends all the time talking. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone, unless they want to hear a long sermon (lots of talking). If you like hearing someone talk for a couple of hours Why not just go to church and listen to a preacher. I was thinking about ordering Tips, ""Cheap tricks and professional secrets"" another DVD by Scott houston, but I'm going to passs on that one, Why because I'm not going to spend another $40.00 just watching some one talk for 3hrs."
1,I did not heed that other reviews and was sorry.,"I put this into my new DVD player. The DVD would not pause, slow down, speed up, etc. So I put it into my computer DVD player (also new). It did not play at all. Color me ""caveat emptor"".The good news is that the Amazon return was easy (thanks Amazon)."
1,Money Waster,I learned nothing from the DVD or the Book that I already knew. He does too much talking and doesn't cover hardly anything. I don't even think it would benefit beginners.
1,Ironweed VHS tape,"Didn't get to view this movie as when I put it in the vcr something sounded wrong. Took it out and the tape was wrecked. Hasn't happened to any other tapes before/after this one. I think it must have been poor quality, too brittle or something..."
3,Overly long but great performances,"The DVD is is Full-Screen Only with Spanish and English subtitles.The film is over-long and drags on interminably and justified only by the great perfomances of Jack Nicholson (not my favorite actor by any means) and Meryl Streep (who should have won the Oscar that year if only for her singing of ""He Me Pal""....that alone is worth an Oscar).If you want a feel-good movie that moves, then avoid this one at all costs. If you want to see an example of Streep's craft at its finest....you will not be disappointed. If you are a fan of Jack Nicholson, again...you will not be disappointed."
3,"Albany, 1938","William Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize novel set to film, the story takes place in Albany in 1938 (with some flashbacks to earlier times). Jack Nicholson is Frances Phelen, a once promising ballplayer who accidentally dropped his baby son, which killed the boy and sent him on the skids to becoming a bum with a ghost-filled past he can't forget. Meryl Streep is Helen Archer, an old flame of Phelen's who too is down on her luck. Nothing much happens in the movie; it's mostly atmosphere: skid row, old memories, etc. At 144 minutes it's way too long--we lose interest in the characters, even though their acting is superb. If only it had been focused a little more--it sort of just drifts along where it should have been nailed down."
2,Not a vert good movie,We did not find the movie very interesting. So I can not recommend it to anybody. It had a strange and disjointed storyline.
1,Non-OAR Release! Product Details are Correct!,"This film has been released for the first time on DVD in a horrid Full Screen only version. Not sure why, but I thought the days of non-original aspect ratio releases were over. Apparently not."
3,This Title Is NOT Pan And Scan,"Before everyone freaks out about the aspect ratio, be aware that this film was shot flat and hard matted at 1.85:1 for its theatrical run (I know because I was a projectionist who ran it back in '87). In a nutshell, this means that it was shot at 1.33:1 and then shown with an aperture plate cutting off the top and bottom so it fit the theatre screen.The version on this DVD is full frame. There are doubtlessly small bits of the sides cut off, but much more is shown at the top and bottom. Is this the way the director intended it to be seen? I don't know (some directors such as Kubrick preferred full frame). I'd be happier knowing what Hector Babenco's thoughts were on the release, but at least the film's not a 2.35:1 pic that really IS pan and scan and missing lots of peripheral info.And more importantly, I'm happy to have the damn film in ANY ratio on DVD finally."
1,***Full Screen Only***,"I received this response from Lionsgate when I inquired about the Full vs. Wide screen question:Thank you for contacting the Lionsgate Customer Service Department. At this time we are only releasing the Full screen version.Unfortunately we have no immediate plans to release Widescreen.So, there ya go. Don't know about y'all, but this is one Streep DVD that won't be hitting the shelf in my library."
4,"Wonderful film, dreadful print","What can you say about a film that pushes the limits of our two finest film actors, Nicholson and Streep, and gives us a wonderful treat as Tom Waites shows he can hold his own in such company. Of course, Waites has made a career of being a grungy, depression-era street guy. Nicholson and Streep are utterly convincing as middle-class people brought low by misfortune, in the toughest time ever to be on the bum in this country. I was wary about purchasing a film I hadn't seen in 20 years, but 10 minutes in I knew I'd been right in trusting my instincts and forking out the dough. This one's a keeper -- until, that is, the owners have the good manners to provide it in proper wide-screen format, and a decent quality print. What they've given us is despicable. Yet the integity of the project, and the actors' obviously full commitment to it, shines through. It's the best thing any of them have done. So far."
3,A quick fun read,"and nowhere as chauvanist as most books of the era. A little labored as the author tries to link all the main characters, especially toward the end, and some unwieldy Deus ex machina surrounding, but I dom't begrudge the time spent with this book."
3,Suitable survey book...,"...but as a new student of Maghreb history, I found this book to be less helpful than I would have liked in providing me the opportunity to identify what the true questions are for somebody wanting to understand how or why Morocco is a unique case worthy of further study."
1,terrible movie,Terrible movie in which Sally Field plays some kind of vigilant who wants to unjustly kill a man. Shameful.
3,Fine for a slow day,"Although totally predictable this movie has its moments. Field is excellent as the bereaved and obsessed mother out for revenge, and Sutherland is completely believable and despicable as the brutal rapist/murderer. Ed Harris is also good, as usual, as Field's husband. It's hard not to sympathize with Field whom the justice system has failed by letting the criminal go on a technicality. But Field concocts a clever plan to even up the score, which culminates in a pretty suspenseful, climactic scene. The sub-plot of a secret, underground society of ordinary citizens who aid and help the victim's families to attain revenge by assisting with planning and supplying a weapon when the justice system fails them was interesting although probably far fetched. Overall a decent film with good suspense and good acting even if totally predictable."
5,fantastic film,"i absolutely love this film, it's fantastic. Kiefer Sutherland plays a brilliant bad guy and shows us that he has the talent to switch roles. He is pure evil in this film but in my opinion he's brilliant. Sally Field plays a very moving part and plays the part of the grieving mother amazingly. The rape scenes are very brutal but the film itself raises very important issues of parental grieving and the demand for justice. One of my favourite films yet. Definitely worth a watch."
3,Good movie (if you love watching LMN movies),I got this for my mother. And she loves it. Even though I don't. Go to imdb.com if you want a full review. Because I could care less to watch this type of movie.
1,"Well acted, badly written","This by-the-numbers thriller spends so much of its 101 minutes making you hate Sutherland's character that you can almost forgive Sally Field's climactic rampage. But I guess that's the idea - if you want to turn a serious issue into cheap entertainment, then moral ambiguity is best left at the door. Though the opening is brilliant, and Field's performance is flawless, it's the morally simplistic storytelling that really grates. What's missing - what's shunted aside presumably in the interests of the thriller mode - is surely the most interesting part of this kind of story: the impact of senseless murder on the lives of those left behind. For a far more articulate exploration of the rage induced by losing a child to crime, check out Sean Penn's infinitely superior ""The Crossing Guard"", starring Jack Nicholson. Similarly, another underrated Nicholson gem, ""The Pledge"", is a much more insightful look at vengeful obsession."
3,Expected more,"This movie is just okay to me. Sally Field didn't play the revenging Mother very well. It wasn't believable to me. Becuase, they have her smiling and acting normal in some scenes. Then in other scenes, she is following the killer and acting like she wants revenge. No Mom would be smiling, or acting normal, in real life right after an incident like that. That is why her character just wasn't believable to me. I felt like I was watching another movie from the Lifetime network also. However, Keiffer Sutherland did a perfect job in this movie. If it wasn't for him, this movie would receive two stars."
3,Eye Have Seen this Before,"This is a decent thriller about revenge. Sally Fields is a good actress and she carries the movie as the others are support roles. Ed Harris does a good job as her husband and Keifer Sutherland is better than average as the sleezeball we hate in this movie. When Fields characters daughter is raped and killed it is the famous overly used case of injustice with the killer set free. Gee we haven't seen than more than a hundred times on TV and in movies. Well anyway she decides to get justice on her terms and when a support group for families suffering from violence turns up a couple others looking for vigilantes, she starts the preparation. Pretty much predictable throughout. I enjoyed it nonetheless, but I have seen so many of this type I didn't find it above average. Worth a rental, but I wouldn't purchase it. If you did enjoy it be sure catch the numerous Bronson ""Death Wish"" movies, and many other movies on vigilante justice."
4,Great Performances! Good Script!,"Should a man be allowed to get away with rape and murder? What happens when a mother's fury is merged with her helplessness? The outcome is: Eye for an Eye. Sally Field does act well but then again she was way too good in Forrest Gump according to me. Ed Harris is nothing but a puppet in the movie - rather more like just there hanging around. So, if the characters didn't do much for me then what affected me so much in the movie?It was the script that got to me. The frustration of a mother whose daughter is brutally raped and mercilessly slaughtered was what moved me. The not giving up soon attitude and wanting justice when all hope is lost - the idea of standing through it all, and hitting back makes this movie truly amazing!"
5,One heck of a great thriller!,"Eye For An Eye is an incredible thriller that will fill you with rage over how criminals in our country can get away with murder on a technicality. Sometimes the law fails us and we have to seek our own form of justice. Sally Field gives such a moving performance. I think it's one of her best. Keifer Sutherland does such a great bad guy too. If you like thrillers, this one will keep you at the edge of your seat. I'd been searching for this little gem for a while...it was complete fate that I found it for $5.50 at Wal-Mart. A great bargain! This movie won't disappoint those who love thrillers. Enjoy!"
1,To hard for preschoolers and adults too,We had this game for my four year old she could not get the ant in the pants. I found it close to impossible also.
2,This Game was Weak!,"I bought this game for my 4-year-old nephew. My sis ter and I had this game when we were little, so I figured that my nephew would enjoy it, too.Things sure have changed! That carboard dog thing that goes in the pants made it almost impossible to get the ants to go in the pants, so I ditched that. The ants are also not very ""flippable"". The overall quality of the game was much better 20 years ago! :)All in all, a waste of money and I do not suggest it."
1,"""No Ants-in-the-Pants""1","We got this game for my son for Christmas. He'll be 6 in January. He has great difficulties getting the ants in the dog's pants. To be honest, I do too. I think he's played with it about 3 - 5 times within this past year. We used to love this game when we were kids! I think the cheap cardboard conastruction of the dog and cheap plastic contruction of theants fosters these difficulties. Now it sits on top of his closaet shelf. Frustration keeps him from wanting to play. How times have changed."
1,Not Durable and too difficult,We bought this for our daughter when she was younger. It was too frustrating. The ants are not made like they once were and it is near impossible to get them into the pants. We would cheat for her and pretend they went in after a long while of trying. Even we could not get them in. Plus the material is so cheesy that they break very easily. Save your money and buy a better game instead.
1,not good for preschoolers,"I bought this game for a 4 1/2 year old and 3 1/2 year old triplets. They were so excited to play it. Unfortunately that excitement quickly turned into frusteration, screaming and crying. Even my very patient and persistent 4 year old couldn't get these ants to jump right. I myself have tried to figure out the 'trick' to it so I could teach them but have had little luck.They haven't wanted to play it again and when I suggest it they refuse. Today we tried it a different way, we put the pants in the middle of a hula hoop and have the kids stand around the outside and try to toss the ants in. They enjoyed this much more as it was something they were able to do."
2,We did not enjoy this game.,"Really, I think these reviews sometimes are just a matterof taste or opinion. We did not enjoy this game, but other families may enjoy it.If I were to give it an age range it would probably be 4-7 years."
3,boring,"I rated this game for my 4.5 years old son. He feels this is a very boring game except that he finds it not difficult to jump the ants to the pant. We bought this game, he played it once, then it is put aside."
2,Frustrating for little kids. And moms. And grandpas...,"My 3-year-old daughter couldn't wait to rip this game out of the box and play. Unfortunately, flicking the ants into the pants was a lot harder than it looked. After 30 minutes we were frustrated by trying and gave up. Later that night, my dad came over and gave it a try. This is a guy who shoots skeet in his spare time - he should know a little bit about aim and trajectory - but after 15 minutes, Grandpa gave up too.We finally had a little bit of success when we threw away the cardboard dog that goes into the pants and just started chucking (not flicking) the ants at the empty pants. But, even with that, it's a still a game we rarely play.I'd suggest skipping this one and purchasing the much more fun, much less frustratingDon't Break the Iceby the same company."
3,NOT a red Megaman.,"I specifically told my friend to buy me a red Megaman. Instead, he gave me Ants in the Pants. ANTS IN THE PANTS! Now I can't make Ultra Megaman! Ruined my birthday party."
4,Fun toy for young children,"I had this game when I was a kid and I loved playing with it.The pieces are charming, even though it tend to be pretty difficult operating if the muscle coordination is not good. I would not recommend this game to toddlers if they want to chew on the game pieces."
2,has anyone found the big blue soundtrack by BILL CONTI?,I have searched and searched for Bill Conti's alternate motion picture score and I have had no luck. Does anyone know how to find Bill Conti's Soundtrack Specialist? Eric Serra's score was good but I was disappointed when I purchased it and it was NOT what I thought I bought. Email me at mszacharias@yahoo.com if anyone has any information on how to find it. Thanks.
1,searching for alternate version,"michelle zacharias , i totally agree with you. I can believe the ruined such a good movie qith such a terrible ending, Im looking for the hollywood version as well, for I think that jacqes should have learnt the lesson with enzos suicide and value life, especially when he is going to have a child from the beautifull woman he loves."
2,BE WARNED: This is Not the US Versions' Soundtrack,"I LOVE the movie ""The Big Blue"" and loved the music so much that I made many calls to LA from Georgia before I finally found someone with the Soundtrack. Imagine my dissapointment when I popped in the tape and started listening too.....the wrong music!!! After doing some research I found out that the Soundtrack was the one to the original foreign film. However the soundtrack was completely rewritten from scratch by Bill Conti for the US version. Why the decision was made to not release this version as a soundtrack I'll never understand. I've been looking for it for years and it's just not available. (If anyone knows where I can find it, let me know please!) The foreign film soundtrack is okay, but no where near as mystical and beautiful as Bill Conti's score. I would recommend buying a wonderful ""new age"" piece of music rather than this foreign film version of The Big Blue Soundtrack."
2,This is not the actual score!,"This ""soundtrack"" is great and it certainly brings back the feel of the fantastic movie when you close your eyes, however it seems the music on this CD was only ""inspired"" by film. Even on the extended 2CD version, which I bought in France, the main theme is missing! Why? That's why anyone would buy a soundtrack, right! What a rip-off! I am so disappointed that's why I only give it a 2 star rating!"
3,Dolphin Musics,"Movie sound track always musics from the motion picture and some title songs. For La Grand Bleu there is a extra experience to audience - the song of Dolphins. The film itself is beautiful + Music I rate it 3 stars. Frankly, arrangement makes people feel they are in deep blue sea and relaxing .I recommend ""Homing Coming"""
5,Needn't to say any more~~~,"Everyone will like his all works whoever don't masquerade his feeling,mind. Needless to say this is the best of his music album. BUY IT, AND FEEL ANOTHER ETERNITY ^ ^;"
2,"Predisposed conclusions, then marshalled facts","This is a product of a conservative think tank, so if you want to hear from people who think of NCLB as a great idea these are your folks. At the least I would recommend you talk to your local teachers and ask how this testing regimen has changed what and how they teach. And keep in mind that many who would align themselves with the Hoover position think that public education is a bad idea on its face, and have an interest in insisting that it is failing in any circumstance. Yes, we should all demand excellence of our schools and their teachers. (We might, by the way, put the same expectations on our children to do the work...)But this book starts from the premise that excellence results from testing, and mentions little about the corruption that allowed demonstration projects based on testing to appear successful, without actually being so. (See this Bill Moyers transcript, [...]"
3,change to 1 star! - larger than expected,"nice looking, larger than expected. It was missing the ball that screws on to keep the jewelry in place, but a call to body candy's customer service informed them of that, and they will be sending me a replacement ball. ** they did not send a replacement ball. I talked to customer service who said they could just send a replacement steel ball that was missing from the original belly ring I ordered. Instead they sent a bright blue plastic jewish star navel ring! 1. the ball is acrylic and doesn't work for the stainless steel version I bought! 2. the replacement is bright blue, which doesn't even match the pink and clear stainless steel version I bought!! 3. Be honest when consumers call you on the phone with problems. If you could not garuntee I get the missing stainless steel ball, tell me that, and give me options!! don't just send me some reject plastic version that doesn't match or I can't use!!!"
3,"Once you start, you can't stop.",This was a good movie. Lots of passion and suspense. Definately a good movie for those romantic dates at home.
5,Excellent Saw,"This saw is excellent for cutting out doorways and windows in newly-hung drywall. It cuts quickly and straight along the framing. You will need to supplement this saw with a small (pointed) drywall saw or drywall router to give this Stanley saw a place to start, and to cut out electrical outlets, etc. This saw is not designed for wood -- you will want to reserve it for drywall."
3,Wrong size,"Good product. Shipped ontime and in good condition. I bought these bricks to replace the ones that had been in a wood burning stove for 30 years. My only problem is I ordered a certain size (Dimensions 4 1/2-Inch by 9-Inch by 1-1/2-Inch) and they shipped 4 1/2-Inch by 9-Inch by 1-1/4-Inch. In all fairness I shimmed up the ones that were sent, with just a little more trouble. Just be aware of the thinner 1-1/4 bricks. Most of the time size is critical."
5,Good Insulation For Your Smoker,I bought the US Stove FBP6 firebricks to insulate the inside of my Traeger pellet BBQ/Smoker. My Traeger has trouble regulating heat and getting up to maximum temperature (~450F). The combination of lining the bottom of the BBQ with these firebricks and a new Nomex Gasket on the lid seems to be doing the trick. Granted - it's summer now so I haven't had a chance to test it below 65F but it is regulating much better and reaching higher temperatures than a couple of weeks ago. Now I can grill pizza in a reasonable amount of time with a better crust.--------------------------------Update: 10/10/12 I had a chance to use my Traeger in temperatures hovering around 50F and the bricks worked beautifully. Managed to keep it above 400F which works great for pizza and kept a more consistent heat at lower temperatures for all my other cooking.
1,broken,All of the bricks were broken into at least a couple of pieces. I returned them and did not reorder so I can't comment on how well they work. I wonder how they managed to break five tightly packed bricks into so many pieces?
5,Great,They work for me. I had to cut them down with a hose and a masonry blade on an angle grinder. I put them in a Vermont Castings wood stove.
3,NOT BAD...,"I have to admit that I am a HUGE fan of VI Warshawski, I love her tough-as-nails outlook on life, but still has a soft heart. She is a damn good investigator, street fighter and has a mouth on her that would make guys blush, she is a tougher version of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, and all VI's stories have a great element of humor in them too...This time, VI is investigating the death of her cousin Boom Boom, who used to work in Chicago's shipping industry. Boom Boom has seemed to have drowned, but VI is convinced her cousin was murdered and spends her time trying to uncover secrets down in the shipyards.Even though the story is good, it really isn't enough to keep me interested. I did finish the book, but there are many other VI stories out there are much better and much more fast-paced than this little sleeper.Ok, if you are a VI fan and you want to read the series, otherwise choose another one."
5,Deadlock (V. I. Warshawski Novels),Another great mystery from a great mystery Novelist. Sara continues to write thrilling and intriguing stories. V. I. Is one tough and smart detective. Great book!
4,Suspense Paretsky Style,"I like this author and anxiously await each book release. Although this book had the required suspense and page turning interest that I've come to expect form this author, I felt that the author was not in a good place when she wrote this one. It had an overall sadness to the book (or maybe I read too much between the lines), but I would recommend the title to fans."
3,an easy read like most of her books,"Always enjoy her books but sometimes, as is the case here, they go on too long and the read becomes tedious. Usually, not too difficult to figure out ""who done it"""
4,Dedication,"loved this book; am coming thru all of them, and following the courageous adventures of Vic!! I see the book is dedicated to Lucella Wieser...... a real ship perhaps???"
4,V.I. Warshawski is a Breath of Fresh Air,"This is an interesting mystery that centers around V.I. Warshawski, female private eye, investigating the death of her hockey player cousin, Boom Boom Warshawski. The mystery takes place amidst the shipping and grain industry of the Great Lakes. Paretsky's characterization of V.I. Warshawski is a breath of fresh air."
2,Missed Alot,This was a very quick review of older and newer models of bmw's. There is no 2002's and no 8 series. What a shame but i am still glad to have it.
5,This is gorgeous,This is a most excellent educational masterpiece! What a way to spend rainy days and kids out of school for the summer.
5,The ultimate heavy metal cd!!,"Zakk Wylde has once again made an awesome kick [butt] cd. ASide form touring with Ozzy, he also was able to release a cd of his own with the black label society. the first 5 songs are heavy thrash metal, along with a mouthwatering solo in each of them. The first track, ""bleed for me"", is simply awesome.There is even a balad, "" Bridge to Cross"", which is also cool. The remaining 6 songs are also speed/thrash metal, which is the best of its kind. This has to be one of Zakk's best albums ever.Stores everywhere are selling out of them, so buy your copy now!!Black label society's 1919 eternal rocks!!..."
5,Amazing,"Arguably the greatest heavy metal album of all time. Every song on this album rocks, not another 2 great songs and 11 fillers album.I wore my original copy out to the point that my car wouldn't even play it anymore and bought it again instead of burning the copy from my pc. This album is completely worth another $15.Lords of Destruction!"
5,Zakk kicks assss,This c.d is so kool it shows why Zakk is one of the best haevy metal guitarists it is a great combination of gutar expertise and SHEER HEAVINESS it poves that old skool metal still has lifethis C.d does for Zakk what he did for Ozzy
4,"Not BLS's best, but decent","This is a bit of a let down. I walked into the store intending to buy this album, they didn't have it so I ended up getting Blessed Hellride. I'm kind of glad now that I got to enjoy BHR before 1919 Eternal, because I wasn't that pleased with it. ""Bleed For Me"" and ""Demise of Sanity"" are the only tracks that make this one worth 4 stars. For good BLS, check out Stronger Than Death, The Blessed Hellride, and Mafia."
1,Zakk's let a Ozzy/Zakk era and Pride & Glory fan down.,"I just can not believe that Zakk or any of his fans would like this crap. First, I will admit Zakk is a really talented guitarists and has released some decent music in the past. But this is rubbish, distorted, enhancing his playing skill in the studio twisting knobs and too much is lost with him playing everything but the kitchen sink. Rather than use a decent drummer, he uses a bad one who's banging really doesn't fit together with his playing or his attempted effort. I'm just going to ignore this stuff and continue to listen to only his Ozzy stuff, Pride & Glory and Book Of Shadow releases."
4,hard rock at its best,"This album is great.There is a solo in every song.Zakk Wylde shows Black Label society's soft side as donewith pastalbums with songs like ""Bridge to Coss"" and ""Lst Heaven"".The 57 second solo""speedball"" caught my attention.Robert Trujillo formerly of ozzy Osbourne shares his talenton the tracks ""Demise of Sanity"" and 'Life,birth,blood,Doom"".I recommend this album to any hark rock fan.if you havent heard this classic,you'll missing out on a great piece of work"
4,"Hey, it's a little different, but it is still good","I have the last 3 Black Label Society cd's and this is the most ""unique"" of the bunch. Stronger Than Death was quite a bit more dark and moody and down right vicious, but this cd is not as gloomy or muddy. The vocals are more up front, the singing is clearer and more to the front. Sonic Brew was great and is more in the line of Stronger Than Death, but this new cd is just as good as the previous ones, it is just different. Any SDMF out there will still love it as much as the others. If you like Zakk, you will still like the new Eternal cd. Give it a listen."
4,Zakk Finally Puts It All Together,"With Black Label Society, there isn't much mystery as to what you'll get: above average Sabbath inspired heavyness with Zakk Wylde's growl about frank subjects like greed and injustice. Luckily Zakk knows how to do this well. ""Graveyard Disciples"" is an old school stomp, while ""Mass Murder Machine"" describes the ideals of war to a tee. The theme of destruction and human consumption permetates the entire disc, especially on thumping numbers like ""Demise Of Sanity,"" and ""Life,Birth,Blood,Doom."" Though this album contains no huge surprises, it's also refreshingly devoid of any sort of forced anger or menace usually prevalent in the heavy music world. A no nonsense album from an honest, no nonsense guy."
1,A Stinker !!!,"A big ripe stinking hunk of cheese !!! The Amazon editorial for this states the following; ""Frank Sinatra took on the role of a psychopathic hit man in this taut, low-budget film noir. The choice shows how interested Sinatra was in serious acting during the mid - to late '50s"" -- LOLOLOLOLOL !!!!! The only thing anybody involved in this POS was interested in was a payday. Frank musta been short the day he signed the contract cause this isn't a B movie, it's an E if there is such a thing. Surpasses so awful it's funny straight to jaw hanging disbelief. Sinatra was well established at this point as a crooner but his acting career was just beginning without any stand out performances to date and from the looks of this, he was taking anything thrown at him. God awful !!!!!"
4,"Sharp, entertaining low budget thriller","Intense, sometimes hokey thriller of small time hoods led by a surprisingly good Frank Sinatra, paid to assassinate the president when he stops in a small town. They take a family hostage, and cat-and-mouse game ensues. Sometimes obvious, some weak supporting performances, stagy. But still more fun and tense then most modern Hollywood thrillers.A warning, I've tried several different versions of this on DVD and have yet to find a decent looking copy. I guess it must be in public domain since so many versions are out there. You might try renting and see if you can find a version that's not scratched up, missing frames, etc."
1,DON'T NEED TO SAY MUCH HERE!,"All I have to say after having wasted 76 minutes watching ""Suddenly"" is that it blew mightily, pure and simple. Nuff said!"
1,This film is horrible.,"I watched this film early one morning on T.V,and I thought it would be pretty good. It had Frank Sinatra and had a good plot. But it was HORRIBLE! Sinatra is wasted and hammy in the role of the lead badguy. All the killers do is waste time! The other actors aren't any better, and the little boy was annoying. The ending is very ob- vious and stupid. The plot sounds like it can't go wrong, but don't be fooled! Stick to ""The Manchurian Candidate""."
5,Legend Films edition w/ restored COLOR & B/W,"This review is for the Restored B/W & COLOR DVD and all I have to say is that the picture is great in color and b/w. I prefer to watch it b/w to have the feel of the original theatrical version. Overall, I would definalty recommend this version of the DVD."
5,An excellent white-nuckler.,"Suddenly is a riveting, highly suspenseful story of an attempted presedential assasination. Had the leading role not been played by Frank Sinatra, it would have just been another movie; however, with Sinatra in the lead -- and a detesable lead at that -- the movie becomes a memorable, rewarding experience."
4,First Presidential Assassination Movie?,"This was filmed in 1954, when Ike was President and Tricky Dick was next in line. What could they have been thinking? It also shows an assassin as a psychopathic personality - another probable first.The assassin thinks his job is a joke: ""if one is killed another steps in to take his place"". That's true, but ticket-balancing usually means a change in personalities and politics, and the forces that each politician represents. But this is unmentionable in this movie.Their diabolical plans come to naught due to the sacrifice and patriotism of common men. The good guys win again in this movie. But Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" shows how it works in the real world. This movie is still entertaining, and worth watching as popular culture from the 1950s."
1,Color,This movie was shot in B&W; for a reason. There is no need to colorize it. Did the production co. ask the director for his approval in changing this film?Pathetic.
4,"Sinatra is the bad guy, Hayden is the hero","One of two Frank Sinatra movies that dealt with assasination. The other was ""Manchurian Candidate."" In this one Frank is the bad guy. Sterling Hayden shows no signs of the future characters he will play in major films of the 60s and 70s (Dr. Strangelove, Godfather). Hayden is just the hick town by-the-book sheriff with the Barney Fifeish assistant. This is not a great movie but it moves along nicely and never gets boring. It has some good ""what if"" situations. It also has wonderful footage of old cars and trains. This would make a good double feature with ""Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"" because one film pushes the pro gun totin' policy, and one is opposed to the use of weapons. It may surprise you which is which. This is not the best movie of the 1950s but the issues raised are still out there. Tom Willett"
1,Warning: FULLY RESTORED does not equal DIGITALLY REMASTERED,"Warning: FULLY RESTORED does not equal DIGITALLY REMASTEREDFor:Suddenly (1954)Studio: Legend FilmsDVD Release Date: June 16, 2009On the front cover at the bottom it states: ALSO INCLUDES FULLY RESTORED BLACK-AND-WHITE VERSION.Being a Film Noir Purest, I just finished watching the B&W; Version and I'm sad to say it is not FULLY RESTORED.This print is not Digitally Remastered.There are at least two scenes where there are a series of two inch white horizontal lines that form two vertical bands on the screen. There are also some scenes where there are a series of very thin black vertical striping spaced about two inches apart covering the full screen. Also there are a couple of film jump splices.In my opinion, this is a 5 Star Film Noir Movie and deserves to be Digitally Remastered.I made a mistake when I purchased this DVD from Legend Films. I took it for granted that when it said FULLY RESTORED that it would actually be Digitally Remastered."
2,not new!,"I bought this as ""new & remastered"" as advertised and this DVD actualluy arrived unwrapped and in an obviously used dvd container. The lable on the cover and dvd are self printed, looks like a home job. Not what i expected when i was promised something ""new"" and ""digitaly remastered"". Kind of embarrasing to give as a gift like I had intended. it looks home-made, is not wrapped in plastic and sealed. And despite the other reviews I'm seeing mine would not play in my new dvd player. The picture was fuzzy & largely pixilated. If you plan to purchase this I hope you have better luck than I did!"
4,CBS keeps them coming!,"It is starting to look as if CBS is going to release all the half-hour episodes after all. This set concludes the fourth season and a number of episodes were adapted from the radio programs. The picture quality is superb. It doesn't get any better. My only gripe, if I can provide one, is the lack of bonus extras. But if you are going to collect the series on DVD, this is the way to go. Columbia House, incidentally, released the first three and a half seasons on DVD and because I already bought those a few years ago, I was pleased to see that CBS, duplicating Columbia House's efforts, didn't stop where CH did. Keep up the good work and more extras please!"
3,Damaged Case,Was not happy with the damaged case I was sent - look like somebody stuck something sharp through the back of the case making the barcode illegible - at least the DVD(s) still played OK
4,Ask your grocer.,"Good oil, nice fllavor, price not bad. But, I can't help wondering, after the cost of shipping, if it wouldn't be better to ask if they could special order it at the grocery store."
5,When tradition meets modernism,"Used to have Val D'Or from Royal Albert, which is a beautiful set, but this one is more modern and young I find. The perfect Match to go with my modern cutlery!"
1,Don't waste your time,"If you want to really know about Port Antonio, Navy Island and Errol Flynn - there are MUCH better books to read. This book is such a mish-mash of events and, often poorly and inaccurately, disguised personalities that it should not be rated as 'fiction' but rather a poorly written compilation of facts. I personally have known and have counted among my close friends many of the characters in this book. Except for some obvious descriptions and badly disguised names, these people are nothing akin to those in this book. Factual errors abound in names, events, characters and locations - which wouldn't be too bad if the book were truly a work of fiction. However, putting a bunch of misrepresentations based on fact into a book doesn't qualify as either 'fact"" or ""fiction"". And as for learning about the lovely people of Jamaica ... how can anything important be learned from such a hodge podge of informatioN?"
1,Turns an OK toy into a world of blur,"Makes the Opteka 500mm lens go from standable to blurry. Plus, you have to go to f/16...you need a lot of light for that!"
5,Nice for the price!,"This lens works nice for beginners. I'm still learning, but if you're like me an learning but don't have the money to spend on the fancy name brand equipment than this will do the trick. I'm happy with my purchase."
2,"Balanced? Decent market advice, but...","We used to subscribe to Kiplingers Personal Finance. We no longer do, because we couldn't help but notice a definite bias toward stock/bond purchasing over any other type of investing. This advice continued in the face of lower interest rates, the overpriced bull, then bear, market, and record low mortgage rates. Articles urging us to keep putting money into the market continued to appear regardless of market conditions. A quick look at the regular advertisers provides an explanation. In five years of subcribing, some of these same regular advertisers (whose results in the market were below par) never appeared in the ""Poor or Worst"" performers columns. For an overall, balanced view of things for the average investor, one of the personal finance magazines such as Money or Smart Money might be more helpful."
4,Good for starters.,"I have been reading this magazine fo rover 4 years and have enjoyed the articles and have benefited from the advise. Although as I have read and educated myself even further I have started to grow more financiallt ""mature"" than what the magazine has to offer. I have since canceled my subscription. This is a great magazine for individuals and families looking to better understand the finance World in a consumer perspective. The article are very well written for the masses and if you send an e-mail to the staff they will get back to you very quickly.If you read the advise you will be on the right path for your finances."
5,Great magazine. Great price!,Love the magazine and am thrilled with getting it through Amazon. Would definitely recommend as I feel that personal finance is an area in which many of us are lacking in knowledge.
2,I can't believe it takes this long to start the magazine subscription.,Why would it take over three months to start a magazine subscription. I am getting emails about reviewing a product that I haven't even got close to obtaining.
1,Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine,"I would love to review this magazine, but unfortunately I have yet to receive any issues. Instead I have been getting ""Field & Stream"", which I did not order. I wrote the so-called ""Amazon Help Dept."" over a week ago asking them to check this situation out. They promised a response withing 24 hours, but I have heard nothing back. Maybe this review will get some action. I hope so."
1,bad purchase,I didn't recieve that product so far so I am totally dissapointed. I didn't have any problems with purchases made trought Amazon.com and this one was a disaster.
3,Mediocre,"Perhaps the most useful way to classify magazines offering investment advice is by the markets they serve. For Kiplinger, this is very much the Middle Class--lots of advice on mutual funds, ""7 Stocks You Should Own Now,"" planning for retirement, etc. Unfortunately, the advice is very much middle-of-the-road and not terribly useful. The magazine loses credibility when the mutual funds it recommends change from month to month.A more entertaining and useful publication, one aimed at the Upper Middle Class, is SmartMoney [2-year subscription], published by the editors of the Wall Street Journal. Not only are their investment suggestions better, but they talk about a lot of other things of interest to those with disposable income (e.g., wine). Even if you don't have a lot of disposable income, it's a lot more fun to read than Kiplinger's, and your conversations will become more interesting."
5,Best for the money,"I have read personal finance magazine for years now. Would not miss an issue. No fluff, and a quick easy read."
1,Junk Mail,"Since I've subscribed I've received much more junk mail. I now receive an additional ten pieces of junk mail per month--offers from other magazines, financial newletters, etc. I would never have subscribed if I knew that my name and address would be sold to advertisers."
2,Don't Know As I Have Not Received First Issue Yet!,Can't tell If I'll like it until I see at least the first issue. I guess Time Will Tell. So Why send this to me now?
5,best out there,"My Smart Money magazine went away (very sad, which i loved). Money magazine is a joke. I had it in the past, didn't like it. Got a new subscription, still don't like it. Decided to look for a new finance and magazine and picked Kiplinger's. I'm on my second issue, and I really like it. Its equal or maybe better than Smart Money. I'm planning to continue and renew my subscription. If you manager your own finances, which everyone should really do, this magazine has some interesting insights. And even if you don't agree with everything, there is always something you can learn. Worth reading. Stay away from CNN/Money magazine. No comparison."
3,Kiplinger's Customer Service,"I ordered this subscription through Amazon. After receiving my first issue, I decided to cancel. So i called Kiplinger's to cancel and was told that I can not get a refund for the remaining issues. I was told to contact Amazon. When I contacted Amazon, I was told that the magazine is supposed to issue the refund. Amazon went ahead and gave me full credit to my account (gift card). This is something to keep in mind when ordering this magazine. I would have preferred the refund to my cc by Kiplinger, but Amazon helped when they really didn't have to."
5,Good Advice,This magazine has good articles and adivce that most anyone can utilize. Many of the articles have relevancy in my world and I think it would benefit most to read this. Good for indication on how to invest and make you money work for you.
4,Great Magazine,Magazine is infomative and interesting. Can be used to assist in investing or just keep you well informed on the bussiness world. Very pleased with my susbsription.
5,Leading the Way in Personal Finance,"This magazine provides an excellent value to readers looking for concise, current and applicable information on personal finance. I recommend it for people at all stages in their financial life."
2,too high brow for me,"I am a 43 year old college educated health professional who reads Money & Smart Money. Kiplinger's is way over my head, more in depth for someone who just has a passing interest in finance and who wants some basic information..."
1,No real information,This magazine is weak. Would never subscribe again. All the articles are really vague and do not provide any actionable items.
5,Great for Kids!,"I purchased this for my kids for Christmas. Although the game's age range is 5-8, I think the age could be higher. My 6 year old can play this with a lot of help, and my almost 9 year old loves it, and I think will enjoy it for a few more years. It is a boardwalk themed game and since we live in NJ, the boardwalk is a well-loved activity for us. If you know the original Monopoly, it is based on Altantic City Streets, which of course to my kids also means the Boardwalk (even though sadly, Donald Trump is taking down the last amusement pier left in Atlantic City), so this is a nice take on a classic game without being too ""commerical"" like the Nickelodeon versions that we have of every other game. I would buy it again hands-down."
5,We love this game,This is more fun for kids than the original because it doesn't take as long to play. It's faster paced and easier. My 4 and 6-year-old boys love it.
5,Fun for all.,"Bought this game for my nephews who were 3 and 6 at the time, they really enjoy playing it. It is easy to show them how to play, a great alternative for the real monopoly for younger aged kids. It also helps to teach counting and number recogniton and the dollar amounts are small enough even for a young child to learn."
5,New Family Favorite!,"I ordered Monopoly Jr. for my 5 yr. old son a few months ago, and the whole family has fallen in love! Some junior versions of popular games fail to deliver, but not this one. Games are relatively quick, really fun and educational (esp. if you child takes their turn as banker). Warning: can be addictive!"
5,Fun family game,My son got this for his sixth birthday. He loves it. It is easy to learn and a great way to learn money. It does go on for hours just like the adult version though. Fun game for the family. My daughter is four and plays with us. It is not too complicated but is still like the original version. Lots of fun.
4,Fun and learning in one,"The children using the game are 4 & 8, along with Mom and Grandma. We all have fun. The 4 year old is learning more about money and counting. The 8 year old is wanting to be the holder of all the ""properties"". The subjects of the ""properties"" are all pertaining to the carnival type setting.I, Grandma, thought this would be great for the other grandchildren."
5,What a fun game!,"One of my favorite games is Monopoly. My children are still too young for ""regular"" monopoly so thought we would give this a try. We have NOT been disappointed. It is helping my 4 & 5 year old learn how to count money and my 7 year old who I bought the game for just loves it - even though he has the worst luck and loses just about every game."
5,excellent kids games,My grandchildren can not get enough of playing this games among others and they try to play more than 1 game at a time but it is a very captivating game of challenge
4,Family fun game!!!!,"Brought this for my 8 year old for Christmas. She loves being in charge as the banker and loves counting all the money she has. I enjoy playing along with her as well as her 11 year old brother. The only issue is that the property pieces colors don't match the game board, but other than that a good family fun game that teaches math skills....."
3,Good for a 6 yr old,My 6 yr old grandson took to the game and enjoyed playing it. Simple and teaches math skills. He did not request to play it again but I think he loves other games instead. He especially loves to build.
4,Fun,"This game is just how I remember it as a kid. It was fun to play with my five yr old, and it taught him about fair play, and money. It does take a while to play just like monopoly does, but it is fun."
5,Lotsa Family Fun,"Since we bought this entertaining adaptation of Monopoly, it has been our son's favorite board game. It's easy for a 5-yr old to grasp and leads to lots of kid laughter and fun. It's even served as a primer for the discussion of addition. Highly recommend."
2,Sorry. . .,". . .but I just can't get excited by this game.I learned how to play ""Monopoly"" at the age of 5. My eldest son learned how to play at 8. My kids enjoy the real game. They don't enjoy the ""kids"" version.Kids are brighter than most adults give them credit for. The original game is a wonderful teaching tool on a number of levels. I don't see the point in ""dumbing down"" when it is not necessary.Parents, teach your children how to play the REAL GAME. Then, there can be some valuable family time. The adults will too quickly get bored with this version -- and frankly, so will the kids.Don't waste your time or money."
2,Stinky Monopoly Jr.,"This is a toy we have wanted for a very long time. Last Christmas we finally got it. Then, we played it for the first time. We noticed the board was small, no jail, very little money. When you bought the land it is much cheaper than regular monopoly. What happened to free parking? Do yourself a favor and purchase regular monopoly. You' ll be sorry if you buy the j.r. edition"
1,A disappointment. . .,"This parent is of the opinion that ""dumbing down"" is not what children need. Rather, children need to be ""stretched"" beyond what they 'think' that they can do, play, or accomplish. With this in mind, get the regular Monopoly set for your kids. Teach them how to play -- and play with them. They will actually learn a game of strategy -- rather than a completely luck-determined ""junior"" version.Your kids will appreciate the quality time -- and, over time, will appreciate the fact that they learned -- at an early age -- how to play one of the greatest board games of all time."
4,Among the best of books on selling,"Question Based Selling details a process for consultative selling to its key elements. The process starts by building curiosity, and establishing credibility. Only then can a sales person and a prospect begin a relationship that may end in success for both. Although not original in its process, Tom Freese uncovers faulty assumptions and opens the process for examination better than most books."
5,"It should be called ""The Psychology of the Sales Process""","This is a great book, and serves almost as a program guide on how to master the sales process. He writes about being aware notions such as ""Mismatching"", which is an ""instinctive tendency of individuals to resist, push back or respond in a contrarian manner"", which is a form of resistance and disagreement that can arise during a discussion w/ a potential sales prospect. (In someways, this can be applied to dealing w/ friends, relatives and significant others, e.g. when someone says something nice to the person, and the other person responds w/ a negative, hurt feelings arise. Same idea for the sales process).Overall, this is a great book, it gives you ideas, a sales process, and a better understanding on how to better engage a sales prospect through effective phrasing and timing techniques."
1,An excellent book with an extremely slow delivery,A good book with a lot of good ideas. But for some reason he takes a long way home with his points. The only thing I do not like about this book is the fact that it is extremely slow. I had gave up on it but a good friend asked to give it another chance and go thru the first 50 pages before you give up which I am glad that I did.
1,Don't buy these shoes.,1. They weigh nothing at all...so no substance.2. The straps are extremely flimsy and thin.3. The straps are tight in the wrong places so it pinches.4. The sole of the shoe is too soft.Basically a bad buy. I wish I could return it. It was a complete waste of my money.
3,great and all but...,"i watched the movie and it's great but not quite inspiring, they kind of didn't make the whole yogic tour. tantricas and advaitans have been left out and the bhakti world haven't been given it's right due the film aimed at the physical culture of yoga more than anything else.the journalist wanted to have an experience similar to that of Paul Brunton's experience with Sri Ramana but never got the chance to meet any advaita teacher."
3,"Yes, he's a cutie pie, but she would have been a much better candidate for her own movie","Thought the premise was interesting, but he was a bit of a downer. As someone who is hooked on yoga, I don't think I would recommend this to inspire anyone. Try again sweetheart, but this time, be the star of your own movie. Then I think you might have something worth sharing!!The quality of this film is very good, and it had some interesting interviews, but he was not the one to ask the questions. Could have been so much more!"
4,HIghly Entertaining,"If the intent of the movie was to shift Nick's world view using yoga, the movie was a failure. Where it was successful was in providing a high degree of entertainment and time spent with several highly unusual people, some of whom portrayed humor and wisdom and a notable patience with some Nick's inane questions and remarks. I often found myself looking beyond the central characters and fascinated by the background people and settings. I also valued the extended interviews found under ""Extras"". They are worth repeated viewing and, to me, contain real inspiration for the seeker."
4,Great non toxic alternative,"For parents who are concerned about chemicals in what has become traditional baby products, this is a great non-bpa replacement for the plastic sippy cup. My daughter is particularly fussy about the recipient she's drinking out of and I was very surprised she accepted this in no time, as I involved her in opening up the Amazon box and be surprised by what she got.The only slightly negative thing about it is that it often takes several attempts before you can properly fix the spout in the lid hole. Once it's done it's totally leak proof."
5,Great Gift for Friends' Future It Girl,"My best friend's daughter had just made the transition to sippy cup, and from a distance, I thought I should send something to commemorate. They adore this product, as does Julia. Beyond that, it arrived on time, and met all expectations. I'll do this for all of my other friends' and relatives' children."
1,"Complicated, hard to assemble, impossible to keep clean","That pretty much says it, as does everyone else who gave it a one-star rating. It's a Petri dish disguised as a sippy cup. It's hard to put together properly because of all the little parts. I bought two. We used them for two months, then I gave up and recycled them. Use your money to buy a Nuby or something similar instead."
2,Disappointed,"It's difficult to disassemble and reassemble this properly-- nothing ""clicks"" to let you know it's properly snapped into place, and when it's not lined up exactly right, it leaks. My daughter loves to play with it, but has so far absolutely refused to drink out of it, defeating the purpose. And the ""made in China"" part scares me in light of all the lead paint issues and toy recalls. I wish I hadn't bought two of these at the same time-- I was so sure we'd like them."
1,A 4-piece lid???,"I have only used this cup once, and it leaked. Probably this is due to not assembling all the parts to the lid correctly, as other reviewers have noted. But come on! There are 4 different parts to the lid!! Who designed this? The fact that this cup is safe and BPA-free does NOT make up for such poor design."
1,I have lost my patience!,"I bought this cup for my son to avoid using harmful plastic. He was 10 months old, took a sip from the cup, threw it on our kitchen floor, and the handle busted off! I emailed Thermos, and after many other emails, they finally sent me a replacement cup. Now my son is 20 months old. He seems to use the cup really well. However, the cup leaks like crazy! He thinks it is really funny to shake the cup upside down to watch the milk squirt out. It leaks from the top and the bottom of the lid. I have finally lost my patience this morning when I discovered my son's diaper bag full of milk that had leaked out of his cup! I had visions of throwing it out of the car window! What a big pain from such an expensive sippy cup!"
1,Bacterial Haven!,"This cup was nice for a few months, but I've noticed a smell for a while. I've hand washed it and put it in the dishwasher, but it still smells. There is a seam on the inside of the cup where the metal meets the plastic. It is impossible to keep clean, as it won't come apart. One morning I actually saw (and smelled) bacterial colonies around the rim. It was disgusting! It's really too bad, because it's a great cup otherwise."
3,Lid gets MOLDY,"Nice cup until it gets moldy way deep inside the spout....won't come off. Nice that it's BPA free, but the mold isn't something I want my child to drink, Can't find any replacement parts....not worth the money if you have to rebuy every few month."
3,"good product, but leaks","I like the product overall; it keeps drinks cold, is made of safe materials, but it does leak."
3,Heavy and leaks,"It's OK but we only use it for water because it leaks more than a bottle. It's also quite heavy for my 11 month old to handle, even nearly empty. Also the plastic parts cannot be entirely removed. If you want to use it like a cup, there's a plastic ring around the edge. I recommend the Safe Sippy over this, by far. The Safe Sippy isn't insulated, but frankly my baby doesn't care about that."
5,Great Sippy,"This is a great cup, both my daughters have one. It rarely leaks, and really keeps things cold. It is a little heavier than other cups, but neither of my girls had a problem with that, even when they were really little. It survives being dropped off the high chair repeatedly. My older daughter likes hers so much I had to get a new one for the baby rather than passing my original one down."
4,my daughter loves it,"I ended up buying this sippy cup (together with the pink 12oz straw bottle) from BJ's where they were cheaper (23$ for both). My daughter loves the cup; I like it too, even though, sometimes - just as others said here, depending on how well you reassemble it - it leaks. Both the sippy cup and the straw bottle do a very good job as a thermos. And I don't consider they are hard to put back together; actually, having all these parts, you can clean them better; just make sure they are dry before you reassemble them, and be a little more careful when putting them together."
4,"An easy, fun read","This is a funny book. If you happen to have liked collecting insects, you'll love this. Action abounds."
1,Unbelievably bad. I beg of you... stay away!,"I have never felt compelled to write a book review for Amazon... at least not until I read 'Pest Control.' It's not possible to go in to everything that is wrong with this mess, so a laundry list will have to do: The writing is atrocious, the premise is ridiculous, the plot holes are enormous, the characters are unlikable and downright annoying, the New York references are insulting to anyone who has actually been to the city more than once, the political commentary is asinine, and the humor is so telegraphed you'll know each punch line about three pages before the author does. I am stunned at the large number of positive reviews for this book and can only assume that Bill Fitzhugh has a large extended family."
4,review of Pest Control,"I am a fan of Fitzhugh, so the reader will gather that I go for zany humor. this is one of his best!"
3,Humorous and technically accurate book.,"Fairly easy read. Enjoyed the analogies presented and the historical information provided. Mr. Fitzhugh did his homework concerning entomolgy. I was impressed.Although somewhat predictable this novel was humorous and light reading. I could see this being a made for TV movie.Being a PCO (Pest Control Operator) I have a certain appreciation for this novel and we advertise ""Pest Control"" on our web site; TritonPC.com."
4,Fun reading,"I have never found anything funny about bugs until I read Pest Control. Fitzhugh's characters are wonderful and his writing style makes them come alive. I would have liked more on the people and less on bugs, but, oh well. I am looking forward to reading more by Fitzhugh."
5,Awesome!,"Pest Control by Bill Fitzhugh is a truly wonderful novel. Fitzhugh takes a classic mystery story set in New York and adds a bunch of weird charachters and plot twists. The book is about an exterminator and his family. The exterminator is appalled by the use of pesticides to kill bugs and is creating his own all natural method using his genetically engineered assasin bugs. He quits his job and sees an ad in the paper offering 50,000 bucks for an extermination job. He sends in a resume and is given the job, unaware that his victim is to be a swiss millionaire. The guy dies anyway, and asassins around the world flock to NY to eliminate their new competitor. Klaus, a soft-hearted crack asassin, befriends him, and the rest of the story is a hilarious chase through the big apple. The book is often found under mystery in bookstores, but it is really a comedy. This book is definetly a read for anyone with a sense of humor!"
3,Bug Puns Galore,"Lo and behold, there is something fun about bugs. Fitzhugh makes it so. The writing style is very likeable, giving this mystery-ish novel a light but slightly heart-stirring feel. The characters are well done, in a comical style, and the realistic touches add a little weight to the story.My only criticism of this book is that I thought it would be laugh-out-loud funny. It IS humorous in the makes-you-smile-on-occasion sort of way, but I don't think I once laughed out loud. There are plenty of things about this book that are unplausible, as well, but you'll be fine with that as long as you dive in knowing that.An entertaining first novel. Would probably read the second one if I happened upon it, but would not go out of my way to look for it."
4,"The stereotypes might 'bug' a New Yorker, but it's great.","As a New Yorker, I found a few of the NYC sterotypes a bit over the top, but the story is histerical. I think I flew threw this book in a weeks worth of subway rides, and found myself missing it's comedy by the time I was done. Now I am reading Fitzhugh's second novel ""Organ Grinders"" and the pleasure continues. Great new novelist, give it a shot."
1,An insulting waste of my time and money,"Perhaps I've been spoiled by the capable and good writing if Chris Moore and others that makes me laugh out loud. Maybe it's because I'm a lady apiary and know that it's a crime to keep killer bees, and it's utterly stupid to suggest one would keep bees in a basement--with nothing to eat or make that honey from. Maybe it's because I've been to New York? Perhaps it's because I know a silenced pistol doesn't sound like ""fwump""--it only makes that noise in the movies. No matter what the reason, I stuttered and staggered through this novel, taking great pains to read one more page...wondering why I'd wasted my precious life energy on this. Even light comedy requires the suspension of disbelief, but every paragraph seemed to be parroted library research, unfounded pesticide dogma, and other regurgitated pop-culture nonsense. The inspiration for this novel was a winning idea. It was the bad attempt at building around the framework that completely failed."
4,"Enertaining, but not his best work.","Fitzhugh specializes in filling his books with absurd characters in absurd situations. This is my third Fitzhugh book and I have to rank it in second. It is funny, but at times his characterization of New Yorkers as oblivious and callous to the violence that can be inherent in that city is even a bit much for me.The overall premise is funny but the book somehow fails to hit the high level of promise that this reader anticipated. That said, this would be a heck of a good movie if you get the right actors involved.If you've never read a Fitzhugh novel, I'd recommend 'Cross Dressing' to start with instead."
2,Could have been much better,"I bought and read this book on the author's recommendation (by email) and while there were some fairly funny parts, the story was tedious and the language was atrocious. It is not something I would recommend to friends who aren't entomologists themselves."
4,Bill Fitzhugh's got great potential,"Pest Control was a good way to pass a weekend that would have been otherwise been spent cutting grass and performing other mundane chores. While Bill hasn't yet reached his full potential as a storyteller, one can gather by reading this novel that more original and readable stories lie ahead. Pest control, while providing plenty of laughs, suffers from slight over-usage of literary cliches. Nevertheless, I'm glad I snatched it from the shelf at the bookstore, and look forward to the future of Bill's creativity."
3,An average book with charming features.,"Pest Control doesn't quite live up to it's billing, but is still worth a read. The cartoony villains and supporting characters push the story along through predictable twists and turns. The vanilla Bob Dillon is out shined by his assassin bug crossbreeds. I found I didn't really care if he survived or not, but I wanted to see if his natural pest control method ever worked. Calling this book `hilarious', as it is plastered all over the back of the paperback, is an overstatement, but the book does have its charms. The sub-plots and supporting characters are so intriguing, that I am going to pick up his next book to see is these strong points can come into the forefront."
4,Bugs are funny!!!!,"Very funny and entertaining. I love Robert Crais and Carl Hiassen and this deserves to be read with their work. Anyone who can bring a dwarf, transvestite assassin to life on paper deserves at least eight points from this reader. I laughed out loud. Looking forward to Bill's next book."
2,Dragged too long for me.,"Although I recognize the humor in this book, I was more amused by it than finding it ""laugh out loud"" funny. The misconception that ensues with the CIA is just not believable to me. And the coincidences that abound were just too convenient and obviously there to move the story forward. Try Matthew Thomas' ""Before and After"" for something along the same off the wall genre... Much better writing style and much more elaborate and intricate plot."
3,Bugs are Funny. Bob's not so hot.,The first 150 pages that deal with Bob and his family are slow going and I had a feeling I read this before only better. I related much better with Klaus and thought he was a much better character. It was a good first novel and I would recommend it with some reservations
1,Another patchwork caper. Tiresome.,"Being ridiculous or crude is not the same as being funny.I didn't care if any of the characters lived or died.Life is too short for this when you can reread Elmore Leonard, Laurence Shames, or Lawrence Block."
4,A lush modern fantasy,"I'm a big Elizabeth Hand fan, and have been looking forward to this book for a long time. As always, her descriptive passages are amazing, and create a lush world that is much more intense than the one the rest of us live in. The three main parallel plots (painter Radborne in Victorian England, his grandson Val in modern America, and journalist Daniel in the modern UK, each pursuing a mysterious woman) all come together nicely by the end, although I found the Victorian plotline the most compelling. Although I didn't fully understand some of the minor plot points(such as the sinister Dr. Learmont's age and ubiquitous shears, or the relationships among various blue-fingered characters), I suspect that many of them would become clearer on a second reading. MORTAL LOVE is highly recommended for readers who enjoy fantasy novels set in the modern world."
2,Disappointing,"Very much an E. Hand fan, very much eagerly awaited a new novel, very much disappointed. The problem is that, for some reason, Hand dove off the deep end with the cheese and the tropes. It's too much asking for suspension of disbelief and too little convincing of any assertion. For the time-traveling enthusiast, try AS Byatt or any number of other twined authors (Powers, et al) for a much more satisfying, much better crafted novel. But other Hand novels are quite nice."
2,GETS LITTLE USE,"Fulcrum LED 2-Pack Card MagnifiersAWKWARDTO USE. POWER CONNECTION AT LIGHT IN BAD PLACE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO INSERT. SUGGEST BUYING LARGER UNIT AS RECTANGULAR LENSE TOO SMALL."
5,Very good! Rare footage...,I purchased this as a gift for a Porsche lover who has everything- and I will say this was amazing. We both enjoy watching it again and again!!
3,Funny as Hell!,"A Cheap Rip-Off ""Trilogy of Terror"" segmaent with the little TIKI Idol but that being said this film was a hoot & after watching it I wished I had a little TIKI dude to do my bidding! Good stupid fun with s***ty acting and laughible scenes! Have a few Mai Tia's & Enjoy!"
4,Good entry in the post-Hollywood trilogy of Corey Haim,"One of the last Corey Haim movies that anyone knows about, due to the fact that it was on HBO like 4 times a week. It's good as always for the pure entertainment value of watching Corey Haim do his thing. He enshrouds no mystery about his character. He's a nerdy actor in a cheesy movie, but he's great! And he's a lot better looking than his all-too-obvious counterpart, Corey feldman, who's appeared in several post-80's low-renter flicks with Haim like Blown Away. But Fast Getaway is worthy of yer money, trust me, and it's one of the first in a continuing line of cult underground films starring this disturbingly enigmatic man known as Corey Haim."
4,A fast ride....,"There are several car chases in this film, and they areall great, considering it's a B movie!The dialogue gets lame in between all the action. Count the # of times Corey says "" Pop "" in this film....could be a good drinking game?Cory Haim brings alot of energy to this film, but he appearsto be high on coke! It's a manic, high strung performance.He was made to be in B films, with his good looks and limitedrange. The high points are a great bridge getaway, a revengeplot with a crazy blonde, and a jail break.The romance/sex scene with Corey and his blonde bombshellis non-existant. Marcia Strassman of Welcome Back Kotter showsup, and brings some stronger acting to the film, which theother actors can't match.All in all, a fun, mindless, popcorn B-movie, and a veryfast ride..."
2,The director should really thank Cynthia Rothrock's feet,"This movie has a ridiculous script,Corey Haim was adored by platoons of teen girls at that time ,because he was handsome;but this is not sufficient.He doesn't act at all,(I saw this fikm dubbed in Italian)but I think that the result is the same.Leo Rossi,who is he?Or whom would he like to be?Gerard Depardieu ,maybe? Listen to me,if the movie is a bit more spicy,everone should thank Mrs. Rothrock skills in martial arts.Her kicks are the only thing worth seeing in his b-movie"
4,"Freaky, unnerving - fits the film well","""The Machinist"" was a very bizarre and freaky film, and listening to the soundtrack brings back memories of the film. The first song is almost scary, the rest have the same theme but are equally good. Not really a soundtrack I would listen to regularly, but good music nonetheless."
3,needs to be more durable,"I remembered this toy from when I was young, so I ordered it for my daughter. She loves it but it has cheap plastic parts. I expect it be broken soon."
4,Great Family Fun with Toddlers,"I bought this toy for my then 2 and 4 year old boys. It took a bit for them to get the concept, but once they figured it out, they loved it. It is a good toy to teach children how to take turns. The toys is very durable and the kids always have a blast when I take it out."
4,"My son loves it even when ""Mommy Daddy"" are playing it.","He screams everytime the pot turns over. We did have to explain that these are not the kind of beans you eat, but he loves the game. Easy setup, clean up; If you need something quick to play before nap time or bed time, this is a classic."
1,Seriously terrible,"The components are flimsy and the gameplay is almost non-existent. It's barely an activity, much less a game. Pretty much my girls like twirling the pot in its cradle and spreading the beans across the floor. Even the smallest of children find playing the actual game to be pointless."
3,Don't Spill The Beans!,"My daughter needed this game to complete her ""Cootie Games"" set, so I bought it. She isn't thrilled with it, but enjoys it to a certain extent. I find it very boring, but I play it with her to make her happy...LOL."
2,"""Ho-hum....boring""","My almost 4 year old grandson tolerated his encounter with this game for two turns and then declared that it was boring. He figured out pretty quickly that if you put one too many beans on the top of the pot, it will tip and the beans will fall. He said ""this is boring""; we played ""Go Fish"" instead. Wasn't worth the money or time invested to put the stickers on the game pieces, and to tell him how to play. It was over in a flash. He enjoyed ""Go Fish"" much more."
1,Pass on the beans... Get don't break the ice instead,"If you like tons of tiny pieces to clean up... And tons of choking hazards this is the game for you.Pros:Idea is neat, balancing beans until the bowl tips over.Cons:Around 60 tiny plastic beans to clean up.Surface of the bowl has very little traction so beans slide and tip off very quickly.The game is too hard for children under 8, and not interesting for children over 8.Suggestion:Buy ""Don't Break the Ice"" instead... Kids love it and it is made by the same company and runs the same price."
3,I'm spilling the beans...,"We just purchased this game for our 3 1/2 year old daughter and she got pretty bored with it after a few rounds of placing beans on top of the pot. Explaining how the game works doesn't really matter - she just thinks that if the beans fall on her side, she wins! That alone is priceless.I like the fact that this game teaches her to wait her turn when she's playing with someone and to only place one bean at a time - for patience. I played with this game as a kid, and it seemed that the entire plastic pot and holder is so much thinner and lighter than 30 years ago. I guess that comes with technology and newer raw materials.On a scale from 1 to 10, I rate this toy a 5. It has to be a great toy if it's been around for 30 years! Just keep things simple for your little ones - they may not engage in this toy for more than 30 minutes, but it's better than alot of the other games out there for 3 year olds."
1,Dangerous Toy,"Who the hell would let a 3 y.o. play with this toy, with so many small and life-like plastic peas? Particularly, the round and smooth shape make the peas easy to be stuck into the kid's nose and/or swallowed. There is a lawsuit waiting to happen."
3,Could be better...,"Unfortunately it takes very few beans before you ""spill the beans"". Each player gets about 25 - 30 beans to start the game, but every game my son (3 years old) and I play, we end up spilling over at about 10 beans total. So the game doesn't last long, which takes most of the fun away. And my son is not learning much about balancing things. Even when I've tried to play alone (and I am knowledgable as to how to balance the pot), I still can't get many beans on before it spills."
1,Flimsy junk,"This is definitely not the same game I remember playing as a kid. This version is cheaply made junk. The bean pot is made of two thin plastic halves that snap together. It's supported by ""hands"" that are even flimsier and make the pot tilt in one direction before you even put any beans on it. Even if you try to load up the opposite side of the pot to balance it, it stays tilted and the beans all end up sliding down to that side and off the pot. My 4-year-old daughter and I tried playing it several times until we both got frustrated with it. Now it just sits boxed up in a corner of her playroom, because whenever I ask my daughter if she wants to play it she says ""No, it's no fun""."
4,Good Picture,"After seeing part of this picture on TV while channel surfing one night, I was intrigued. I figured that it would be nice to see the entire movie from the beginning to end without it being formatted for TV with the scenes being cut. I was not disappointed. I enjoyed watching the movie and thought it was well done. It is one of many movies that I have no memory of ever seeing or hearing about. If you have an interest in any of the leading actors and have not seen this film yourself, you should watch it. I think you will be surprised like I was. I don't know if Roger Ebert liked it or not (I value his endorsements), but I give it thumbs up.No problems with the transaction. I paid what I think was a fair price with decent s/h fees. I would buy from this business again based on this transaction."
3,Hopeless,Well-made & acted but morbidly sad movie marred by fatalistic ending that leaves the viewer discouraged. A movie without hope or entertainment value.
5,"A Fantastic Thriller - Great Plot, Great Acting, Great Music","I'll just be short and to the point. Watch it. Second to ""Hot Dog"" in The Right Stuff, I'd say this is Quaid's quintessential role, and Ryan's best roll ever. Paltrow is perfect, Caan - well, no arguments here - and the cinematogrophy is just beautiful. Makes me want to move to Texas. Too bad that Texan didn't like it. I'm afraid your'e outnumbered Tex!"
1,One of the worst movies ever made!,"With such heavy-hitting box office names like Meg Ryan, Gwyneth Paltrow, James Caan, and Dennis Quaid, you would think this would be a winner, right? Wrong! This movie is all about unbearably exaggerated southern accents, dysfunction with a capital ""D"", and murder. It has no real direction or point, and the ending is senseless. What a waste!"
2,STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE,"Director Steve Kloves manages to make Texas look both gorgeous and desolate. Thomas Newman's score is haunting and evocative; Dennis Quaid, James Caan, Meg Ryan and Gwyneth Paltrow offer complex, fleshed out performances. What destroys the film in my opinion is its listless pandering, its inability to focus on the truth of the issues and its ambiguous and unfulfilled ending. FLESH AND BONE also pulls a big coincidence that manages to be both improbable and unbelievable. Kloves ""twist"" is predictable from the moment Meg Ryan appears on the screen, and the inevitable confrontation between Quaid and Caan is also telegraphed a mile away. In spite of its good performances and atmospheric direction, FLESH AND BONES is empty and pointless."
5,A well acted and directed intricate piece of filmaking (sp),"No one is less of a Meg Ryan fan than I. She is, entirely too cutsie for my taste. Not that she's bad to look at mind you. But in this film she is about as sexy, real, and sympathetic as possible. Her performance was perfect for the part.Dennis Quaid gives his finest performance ever as the tormented son of James Caan.It's pretty easy to see where the film is headed fairly early in the picture but it's so well acted and directed that it's well worth the price of admission. The film is extremely character driven including an incredibly cheap yet sexy Gwyneth Paltrow.The movie has much to say about relationships, loyalty, selfishness and the price paid because of them."
2,real good mystery,I don't know the connection between the girl at the old farm house and the young cowboy
5,Close to Perfection,Michel Legrand could aptly be described as the French Burt Bacharach because of his preoccupation with melodic structure and harmonic charm. This movie is really an OPERA in that not a spoken word of dialogue is heard and everything is wrought in song and luxurious orchestral commentary. The success of the music in conveying the full meaning and pathos of the story is without question. To hear Deneuve - who could easily have gone on to a career as a singer - in the full flower of youthful vocal passion is a rare and emotional treat. Castelnuovo is superbly urbane in the manner of young French guys of the period and the whole thing is one of the least common and musically inspired hour-and-a-halfs you will ever spend.
5,This romance knocks your socks off!!!!!!!!,"What music!! What passion!! In the bodies of Deneuve and Castelnuovo, what beauty!! This timeless musical is everything a viewer could ask for. The songs resonate with feeling, and one would have to be an unfeeling boor not to be moved by the music. A definite, unqualified TWO THUMBS UP!!!"
3,Ningxia Red,"I tried this product for 30 days in a row, with 1 oz per day... I did notice that it gave me a quick wake me up kick without caffeine, but I have been off the product for about 2 weeks to see if I would notice difference... Too bad, not much difference... Caffeine is cheaper... So, I won't be reordering the product... However, if you want to get by without caffeine, this will be a nice alternative to get a quick start to the day... There is no rush - but you certainly are perky and ready to go just 10 minutes later... Be sure to keep it refrigerated!!!"
2,Suggested price is very misleading,"This helmet is said to origianlly cost over $200, which leads one to believe this is an exceptional piece of handmade helmetry. In actually it has a Made in India sticker on the inside and it looks like it was caste from a simple mold. Another issue, I don't have a large head, but this helmet is very wide and deep. The depth is good to stuff a shirt into for comfort, but the extra width can't be accomadated for. Also, the plume is attached by two nuts/bolts at either end, so without an additional support in the middle somewhere the plume can easily flop side to side. Overall, the $48 (after S+H) is maybe a little to much for this item."
1,Terrible,"seriously, this is not a good album. i actually fell asleep in the middle of the CD. lots of boring tracks and jojo's voice is really starting to annoy me."
3,Worth the wait?,"The duo of K-Ci & JoJo have now released 4 albums during their time apart from Jodeci. Although I have always been a huge fan of K-Ci and JoJo from their Jodeci days, one could only sigh when listening to this album. There are some outstanding tracks on the CD, but all in all it's the same old formula they have used on the last 3 albums. Commercial ballads, some which bore and put you right to sleep. It's Me, produced by Rodney Jerkins is the only uptempo track, and definately one of the standouts on the album along with I Don't Want and the Babyface produced track, Down 4 Life. This album of course means that the forever delayed Jodeci album is pushed back again. One can only wait for for DeVante and Mr. Dalvin to hook up with the Hailey's again to make some real R&B music."
5,i just love this cd because it off the hook and it better th,i just love this cd because it off the hook and that it way better than they last cd they ha put out and that which is call x but anyway just about all of they cd is off the hook and that my favorite song onthis cd are down for life and i don't mind and love me carefully and that im looking forward to get jodeci new cd whenever they come out with they new cd .
2,Can they Sing?Yes! is most of this Material there Best?NO!,K-ci&JoJo Can Sing there is no doubt about that but these Cats are stuck in a HallMark line of Sappy Slow Jams.once they found a Fourmula they were nailed in that line&haven't come from it at all.Vocally they can ahng with anything that is out nowadays but Musically&Lyrically I get plenty of time too take a nap when I hear much of the material here.
3,not their best one..,"There are too much slow songs on this album. The tracks are far away from their first album ""Love Always"".Good album 4 bumpin da ladies heheMy favourite Tracks are ""It's Me"" and ""How can I trust you"""
3,Neutral results,I take it because it was recommended by the owner of a local gym I attend. Neutral about its results.
4,MOST IMFORMATIVE BOOK ON BIRDS,AS BREEDERS OF PHEASANTS WE FOUND THIS BOOK MOST USEFUL IN THE CARE AND FEEDING OF THEM. HE EXPLAINED THINGS CLEARLY AND CONCISELY IN A WAY WE COULD UNDERSTAND. IT WAS VERY HELPFUL AND INFORMATIVE. BUT IT WAS VERY PRICEY.
4,MOST IMFORMATIVE BOOK ON BIRDS,AS BREEDERS OF PHEASANTS WE FOUND THIS BOOK MOST USEFUL IN THE CARE AND FEEDING OF THEM. ALSO DIFFERENT BREEDS HAVE DIFFERENT HABITAT NEEDS. HE EXPLAINED THINGS CLEARLY AND CONCISELY IN A WAY WE COULD UNDERSTAND. IT WAS VERY HELPFUL AND INFORMATIVE. BUT IT WAS VERY PRICEY.
4,The Missouri,The book was in good shape even though is was used. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The photography was great. The subject matter was quite inclusive. Thanks.
5,Much needed prayer,"I gave this book 5 starsWhile growing in my relationship with God it was brought to my heart that my children who are also God's children should have a relationship with Him too. I started this book thinking it would have maybe daily prayers, but instead found a story about the type of relationship a mother should have with her children. I was deeply moved and convicted to have a deeper relationship with my children especially when it comes to our Father in Heaven. This story serves a wonderful example of what a faithful and praying can bring to a family.I recommend this to any mother seeking some Divine instruction on motherhood."
3,Free book,It was a good short story. It was what you can expect for free. just got a lot of free books.
1,An appallingly written textbook.,"One of the most difficult aspect of learning Russian is the use of prepositions (at least in my experience). I bought this book hoping that my task would be made easier but to no avail. The explanations are often incomprehensible. You come away feeling terribly confused and you feel like your knowledge is going backwards. The exercises are difficult to understand and there is no answer key at the back of the book. So you have no idea whether you comprehend something or not.The presentation of the book is ordinary at best. You just get huge slabs of text. The chapters don't have any logical progression.The book is also terrible value for money. The asking price of $30 plus is just about robbery.Overall, this is the worst Russian textbook I have encountered."
4,"Great alone, but not with other topicals.","This is a very effective cleanser. I tried to use it with Poetry In Lotion, but it was too much and my face peeled too much. The peeling is actually a sign that you are getting results, but it was so bad that I couldn't wear makeup. I am getting used to the Poetry In Lotion first and I will gradually add the Wrinkle revenge to my regimen."
2,DERMAdoctor Facial Cleanser 3,I was charged an additional $22 to be able to pick up the item ? was told it's duties by the broker?
5,A mesmerizing vampire sleuth story!,Vampire investigator Jack Fleming seems on his way to being a nightclub owner when the remains of a woman's body are discovered walled up in the basement. It's up to Jack to began a probe of her death using his special vampire powers - which may not be enough to help him.
3,"OK, it was a really bad movie","I only bought this movie because the real ""star"" is a Trabi and I had to see it. I got it on VHS because it is one of the few movies ever made that did not make the transition to DVD. This has to be the absolute bottom of Billy Dee William's career, he must have REALLY needed the money to do this turkey. Buy it if you are a Trabi lover and add it to your collection of ""stuff"", but don't expect to see a good movie. I gave it three stars because of the car, but if it was not for the car I would have given it one. But only because it is not possible to give it zero."
1,Take Care it is Firewire ONLY,"I rated this one star to get your attention. I didn't read the info closely enough and after I received it I found our that this was not USB AND Firewire; just firewire. I wish it had been USB as well. It is a nice lightweight device that looks as if it would have been ideal for my purpose. I sent it back to Amazon and bought the Iomega 160GB which is a GREAT, cool running, and quiet drive.d"
5,jeezo,"I paid 1/5 this amount ($219) on Amazon about 3 months ago. It is a very good backup drive, especially for $45. Maybe it got 5 times better somehow?"
1,Freezes up like crazy,"I purchased this hard drive about a year ago, and I hate it. When my powerbook goes to sleep, it freezes. I contacted the company and they said they were aware of the problem but could not fix it. Now, if I don't use the drive for 15 minutes, if freezes and I have to manually remove it from the computer to reset it. I do not recommend using this to backup important data as it is simply not reliable."
1,Not of One Blood,"Reading through this book I was not surprised at how horribly it was written. Inside the trio of authors pay little regard to biblical teaching/context & biological science so as to produce a humanist/universalist fantasy to align Jesus with MLK, Stephen Gould, & Noel Ignatiev.Luckily there is a remedy: Not of One Blood by Charles Weisman [...] which addresses the issue & exposes this work as misleading, unscientific, and most important of all unbiblical."
1,What crud,What this book never asks nor answers.Is why did GOD create all the different races and by virtue chaos if we are are all truly one race? Nobody even asks this let alone try ti explain.Also apparently not only this author but alot of so called christians dont seem to know there bible.Where GOD not only commads but demands racial purity from the israelites through out scripture.Again if we are all the same.Why????
4,Thought provoking,"Thought provoking presentation of facts to refute many of the arguments that defend racism. Helps to establish what a Christian's perspective should be in response to racist attitudes and ignorance. Meaningful historical information, particularly eye-opening with linkages of Darwinism and Nazi racism."
5,removing all doubt,"This book removes all doubt about the origin of man. It reveals that race is a word which few understand, thinking there to be more than one race. There are many families (ethnic groups) of men, but only one race, the human race. This book strips away the false basis of judging others according to any outward appearance. Discrimination is thereby affirmed on the basis of character, not skin shade."
4,Well argued!,"Christians have been responsible for many stereotypes and other forms of racism. But, I think we should make a distinction between Christians who are responsible and Chrstianity that is responsible. Nowhere in the Bible is their any kind of racism whatsoever. The Bible is colorblind. What One Blood does is show how race is nothing more than cultural identity (and no this book isn't against culture), and how God embraces anybody regardless of their past or the color of their skin. Well, worth the read."
1,?,"I have never heard this cd BUT the only songs that I know on it are foolish,always on time,& excuse me missso I dont think that it is that good"
1,Greed at its Apex,"for the price of this book, one gets brief glimpses intto few of a great number of fallacies. Aalthough the colorfull story of the book is briliant, the lesson(s) could be gleamed from maaany other books, particulary of the subjectts of philosophy, arguments, and logic. After finding this book att the library, i wanted to own it; after seeing the price, I see it as my duty as a reader and sttudent of philosophy to urge you away from the pit of money this book demands for the small parcell of knowledge this book returns. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
4,Near-brilliant book,"That can't fairly be encapsulated in an on-line review. Unfortunately, with an absurd price tag like this, not too many people are going to read it, and I agree with them. This price is greed at its worst. Try the library or borrow a copy, as I did."
4,"Classic, timeless toy","My oldest son is 22 years old, and my youngest is 14. In between, we've had no less than three different versions of this game and it's a timeless classic. We're going to buy it for our granddaughter because of all the family fun it brings to our home.You'll be amazed at how fast your toddler can actually WIN THIS GAME! The game tests a child's memory--which, surprisingly, is much better than mom's or dad's. This fabulous game is an excuse to bring the family together to test how well we can remember images, and the children almost always win. When they win, they gain self-esteem and adults earn respect for their skills. Even more important, perhaps, is the time spent together as a family.The game's a timeless classic that should be in every home that has a child."
4,a classic game for preschoolers,"This is the Memory game you remember from your childhood, with updated pictures. My kids love it and have fun just playing with the bright and sturdy cards. No bells or whistles, just classic fun for the youngest set."
5,Great Game,"Takes awhile to get the 72 pieces set up, but it's a great game. Better to play with more than 2 people."
4,Memory game is fun for all,I bought this for my granddaughters who are 2 and 4 . The 2 year old doesn't understand the concept of taking turns yet but loves to play with the tiles. The art work is colorful and fun. The 4 year old understands how to play but also plays with the tiles and makes up games and stories with them. This was a good purchase and I recommend it. We got the original but any of the Memory games would be fun.
5,Great Revision,"This is a great revision of the Old Memory, which I actually still had from my childhood. Let us compare: hmm...nope, can't identify what some of the pictures in the original Old version were supposed to be. New version...much easier."
4,Is a fun game but...........,"My son (4 year old) may be too little for 'Original Memory', he gets bored after matching a few cards."
2,What a disappointment!,"I liked this movie the first few times I watched it but then later I realized how much this is nothing like the first two Halloween movies. Halloween 4, 5 & 6 are kind of weird and confusing, the curse of Thorn and all that mess. Hey, its a good movie and all but the ones I would buy are the first Halloween, Halloween II and H2O, those are the best ones I think because if it doesn't have Jamie Lee Curtis in it then its not a Halloween movie."
4,The night he comes back home,After Halloween 3 bombed out of theaters they took the hint and brought our good friend Micheal Myers back to leave a pile of bodies all over Haddonfield. Micheal comes out of a coma and is once again on the streets of Haddonfield searching for his neice who is the only one of his family who is left alive. It was good to see Micheal back on the screen but he didnt hit with the impact that he did before. I thought this was a good movie but most people didnt. Although the body count is high in this film there is a lack of violence and gore. Rated R for mild violence and sexual sitiuations
4,Brilliant comeback..as entertaining as the first.,"We thought it had ended in Halloween 2. We were wrong. Psychotic killer Michael Myers(still in a coma from the fire 10 years ago in 1978) suddenly wakes up when he hears he has a niece from his ""deceased"" half-sister Laurie Strode. Soon Jamie Lloyd (played by the beautiful Danielle Harris) must confront her evil uncle once and for all before it is too late. Donald Pleasance returns as the mad doctor, Dr. Loomis determined to stop Michael once and for all before it is too late. But his fears come through when he soon realises that Michael has come home again and this time there will be no mercy. Excellent sequel with a good plot and still manages to keep one at the ""edge of their seats"". Danielle Harris is excellent as the new scream queen. Co-starring Ellie Cornell as Rachel and Beau Stowe as Sheriff Waters."
3,"Great movie, great picture, missing extras!","Anchor Bay really dropped the ball on this one, since they were unable to include several extras that they initially announced. It's a shame because I was really looking forward to being able to ditch my old DVDs.Beyond that, these discs are great. Certainly much better treatment than Echo Bridge is giving some of the later HalloweeN sequels. My only wish is that one day, a company could snag the rights to all of them!"
4,Great film.,"Great film. Kathleen kinmont gave me a chubster when I first watched this... I was like 8. I prefer this one over part 5, not much blood and the violence is tame for todays standards, but its a friggin vlassic. Get off yer asses and purchase this NOW"
4,this is the best sequel since the 2nd,i 1st saw this one back when it was just released on VHS and it was just terrific as munch as the original + part 2 from the 5th which came a year later they lost the effect which made this one work. i hope they make something better then what zombie made with part 2 in his creationwatch it its a classic
3,Typical.,"HALLOWEEN 4 is a typical horror-slasher flick. After being in a coma for ten years, Michael Myers is to be transported to another institution. On the ambulance ride, a loose-lipped nurse reveals that Michael's sister is dead (supposedly) but that he has a niece living in Haddonfield. That info awakens Michael from his coma and he goes on a killing spree in search of his little niece, Jamie.HALLOWEEN 4 copies a lot of things from the first two HALLOWEEN movies. It also is full of plot holes and produces more questions than it answers.Don Pleasence returns as Dr. Loomis and incredible as it is to believe he is alive, it's great to see him on the screen because without him the film would have been much, much worse.Overall, typical."
3,This is flawed but heck of a lot better than halloween 3,this is a flawed movie but still brings good action scenes and sometimes is scary but not really. ive seen every Myers movie and this is in the okay. you will enjoy this film it is good for to watch in the dark.
3,Not Bad...and Sometimes Creative...........,"I'm trying to remember all the details to this film, but I remember thinking it wasn't too bad a sequel to the first two Halloween Films, although the original was far superior to the second one. The little girl is excellent in the film, and she gives feeling to her character. The main question I have about the film is who is that ""guy"" with the pointed boots at the end of the film who sets Michael free from the jail cell at the end of the film. No one seems to mention this character and I was VERY disappointed the story never explained it in the next film. Does anyone out there know what I'm talking about? Love to hear from you.........."
2,Halloween turns into a parody of itself,"The first Halloween was a horror classic, the second was a respectable rehash. The third was an ill-conceived attempt at something different. With this Halloween movie, the series turns into a big joke. The story is completely by numbers, the acting is horrible, and the dialog is probably the worst I've ever seen in a horror movie. Even Donald Pleasance looks like an idiot, trying to keep a straight face while saying his lines in that aweful make-up. The movie has a totally generic feel. OK, there are a few scenes that make you jump, but these are cheap thrills. The ending was a good try, but not believeable. This was the beginning of the end of the Halloween series!"
2,Sam Loomis is getting old.,"They say that good horror was dying by the late 80's. I'd say by then it WAS dead. You can tell in this movie that it's not the same actor playing Michael Myers,It took them 7 years to bring back Michael, It has a really bad ending and Loomis does virtually nothing in this movie. He kicked a$$ in the first one and that(the proof that old men can kick a$$)is what made me like the 1st one. Still, there is a lot of suspense built up over time and that alone is what scared me."
2,Rates higher than 4-6 only because no cult B.S story.,"I rate this one a 2, higher than the 1 that I rated 5 and 6, only because the whole cult thing hadn't been introduced in full swing yet. As with 5-6, Michael should have been left dead and buried (or ashed). If the movie had a better ending that finally ended the Myers story, I probably would rate it higher. But they got greedy, and just couldn't let it end."
5,The third best of the HalloweeN saga,"THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!!!! Besides H20, and the original HalloweeN, this is the best of the series. Michael Myers returns with a vengence, BIG TIME!!!!! Danielle Harris is so great of an actress. I give her five stars by herself. Donald Pleasance was also great in this movie. We all miss Jamie Lee Curtis, but Danielle Harris is a very good substitute. HalloweeN 3,5,&6 are retarted. But this one is a MUST SEE!!!!"
1,Retarted,"After Halloween 1 & 2,I expected this reunion sequel (10 years later) to be awesome.Not even close. One reviewer here commented that the dumb hick town made it worse,agreed. One part has a bunch of fat rednecks going on a ""witch hunt"" for Myers but wind up shooting one of their own.So we're supposed to care about these scabs? The character of Jamie Lloyd is equally distasteful.A snotty brat who gets teased by classmates. Myers still wears the same coveralls from part 2 and just happens to find his favorite mask in a dime store. Dr. Loomis now appears as just a bumbling shrink instead of Michael's concerned psychologist. Plenty of scenes copied the original.This movie is a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of the first two. A real joke."
1,Halloween 4: The Return of Micheal Myers,Of the whole Halloween series this movie didnt seem to be that bad as most people have said it to be. This movie starts off with a pretty good scare and then it continues through the whole movie this movie was one of the best in the Halloween series.
1,Crap,"The Halloween series should've ended with Halloween III. The fourth in the series opens the door to make lots of cash for the creators and do absoultely nothing for the art of film making. Michael Myers died at the end of Halloween II after being shot in the eyes by Laurie, blinding him permanately yet he still manages to go on a killing spree and murder a dozen people. Made with no talent or imagination. John Carpenter and Debra Hill got out while the going was good. They had brains, unlike the audience that this, and the continuing sequels were made for."
2,CHEAP AND BORING MOVIE,I seen this movie back in the 80's when it came out and thought it was bad back then and the bluray isn't any better. The sound is so low that it cant be enjoyed so whoever mixed the sound for this disc gets an F. The low grade actors and very poor directing makes this film a complete waste of time. I would think that a sequel to a movie ten years later would be plenty of time to come up with a good idea...NOPE...you get a truck load of trailer trash that goes around shooting into the bushes and killing people they think is Michael Myers....??? Who the hell would be hiding in the bushes anyway??? STUPID!!! STUPID!!!!And just a little heads up.....HALLOWEEN 5 is worse!!
2,Halloween 4 DVD... It's ok....,"I picked up the Halloween 4 DVD yesterday.... This was my first time seeing Halloween 4 and it was pretty good. The Extras on the DVD are pretty average, but better then some Horror DVD's that are out (Child's Play, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2). It features a 17 minute documentary type thing which I thought was pretty good. The girl who played the niece (I cant remember her name)she's hot ... now. And the DVD also features the Theatrical Trailor. I wouldave liked to see a Commentary too. For the movie itself, I thought it was pretty good, except for Michael Myers Mask. It looks whack ... and he looks pretty built too in some scenes, and I think in the School house scene, he actually has blonde hair. If your a fan of the series,I would pick it up ...."
5,"BAD DVD, but great HALLOWEEN sequel",Let me make this short and sweet. HALLOWEEN 4 is one of the best HALLOWEEN sequels and very possibly one of the best horror movies of all time.The DVD is a dispicable disgrace. Anhor Bay has once again ripped us off with this poor excuse of a special edition. The making of is only 17 minutes and very dull and aside from that we get 1 trailer. DO NOT BUY THIS!!
4,Halloween 4. Good sequel gets good DVD,"Just picked up this DVD (from Amazon, of course) and boy is it great! It's almost like watching a completely different movie. The colors are great, the image is super clear, and the 5.1 channel sound is also good. It's about time this movie got the DVD treatment. It's just too bad there weren't a lot of fun things on the disc. This movie is considered, by some, to be the best sequel, (I disagree, part II is still the best after the original) and it does deliver the goods. Featuring John Carpenter's creepy Halloween theme, and great music, this movie is sure to scare you. The DVD is a must for any horror fans!"
5,A Great Horror Film,A great Halloween to save the series. Much better than most other sequels and saves the series from downward spiral of Halloween 3.
3,"""Michael is back and he's pissed""",In Halloween 2 Michael was knocked into a coma. In halloween 4 he wakes from his ten year sleep. Now he is after his niece jamie( Laurie's daughter) who was adopted for her own protection. This movie is good but is far from the first two. Michael is now very disabled and slow. But his technique is just as good as it was 10 years ago. If you are into Michael than you should see this movie.
5,MAGNIVESCENT,THIS FILM IS SUPERB A GOOD OLD HALLOWEEN WHICH HAS YOU SCARED OUT OF YOUR BOOTS I HOPE THERE IS MANY MORE TO COME
4,this was the best one from the first 5!,"this movie was creepy and spooky and heartpounding and horrifying.please see it! it is soooooo creepy. except, i had to take off 1 point because the mask looks/not scary like in #1&2.it is my second favorite halloween! it is a must see. it is suspenseful and there are cool effects! rated R for violence and some sexuality. this movie overall gets about 4 stars/which is good,its like a 93%"
2,he is DEAD,"Ok i like to moan i mean just look at my reviews of jaws 3 and 4,so i will moan.MICHEAL MYERS IS DEAD...yes i said DEAD.in h2 he was on fire and you even saw him burn to death alond with loomis who also died in h2 but he is back with just one scar.myers also has no marks on him from a major blast.ok the film is ok i enjoyed it but two stars is all it deserves. P.S micky myers is quite cute...oh its a mask! sorry"
2,A Work In Progress,"Ten years later after the first massacre, Michael Myers who was presumed dead by most after getting crisped in a oxygen tank explosion escapes from a mental hospital and goes after his niece Jamie Loyd (Harris). Although still nothing impressive, a steady improvement from the past few sequels."
3,The Return Of Michael Myers,"Michael Myers returns after after the second one where he should've burned but i guess hes still alive. Before i saw this i thought to myself that it would be nothing more than a bad sequel, but i was wrong. The story revolves over of Laurie Strodes' daughter jaime. Jaime Loyd played by Danielle Harris seems to be stocked by her uncle a.k.a. Michael Myers on a Halloween night. This new halloween seems like the other ones, but has a plot twist at the end that makes the movie a whole plethora amount better. This one I would reccomend to rent but not so sure to buy. All i can tell you is this flick is a great popcorn flick to watch in the dark."
4,This is one of the best horror films,This is horror movies at its best.This movie is simply awesome after the original king of horror movies Halloween I this is the prince to horror movies this movie is simply awesome.
2,Michael Myers - losing his edge!,"Let us not mistake the fact that Halloween is and will ever will be ""THE"" horror movie of all time. Saying that, it was a great disappointment to view the fourth installment of the Halloween series, which in hindsight, fell short of what it was trying to accomplish. There is no real fear in the eyes of the stars, even in Laurie Strodes daughter, faking tears more than anything. The lone stand out in this installment would be the sure-fire wit of the aging Donald Pleasance, which we all thought perished in the 2nd movie, but we also though Michael died as well, what a surprise! Overall, the movie was good, but could't find the mark as in the first two films. Maybe if Carpenter stepped up and directed this version, it might of found the same ambition as the first few. I would recommend this movie, but would tell the viewer that if they expect the same atmosphere as the previous ones, they are mistaken."
3,THANK GOD THEY DID THE RIGHT THING!,"IT'S A BLESSING FROM GOD THAT THEY NEVER CHOSE TO CONTINUE THE PLOT OF ''HALLOWEEN III; SEASON OF THE WITCH''. IN THIS THIRD SEQUEL, MICHAEL RETURNS FROM A 10 YEAR COMA TO KILL HIS NIECE. THIS ONE MANAGES TO CRANK OUT ENOUGH THRILLS TO MAKE THIS AN ACCEPTABLE SEQUEL. AS ALWAYS, DONLAD PLEASANCE SHINES AS DR. LOOMIS. BUT IT'S TOO BAD JAMIE LEE CURTIS DIDN'T RETURN FOR THIS ONE. SHE WOULD'VE BEEN GREAT FOR THIS ONE. THE NEXT TWO SEQUELS WOULD PALE IN COMPARISON TO THIS AND THE FIRST TWO HALLOWEENS. THIS MAY BE THE BEST SEQUEL THAT ''HALLOWEEN'' HAS TO OFFER."
4,Pretty Good!,"This turned out to be a good sequel. Though not as good as one and two, it still deserves a rental."
4,Pretty Good,"Not as good as one and two, and it took a while to get scary, but it was still a very good movie. I was impressed."
5,Entertaining sequel.,Unlike most sequels Halloween 4 lives up to John Carpenters original.It is so much like Halloween that it and the original are the best in the Halloween movies.Period.
3,Good movie plenty of scares.,"It was a good movie. Michael Myers regains conscienceness andescapes. Good start. It was inventive.(The power failure.) It wasscary how the cop thought his partner was sitting there but when the lightning flashed, you saw his dead partner hanging on the wall. Rated R for violence, terror, and some sexuality."
3,The Shape returns....,"All in all, this wasn't bad a movie. The storyline is a very simple and straight forward. The Shape returns to Haddonfield, when he learns that he has a niece. Dr. Looomis is called in to stop him, before Myers can killed his niece. Donald Pleasance does an excellent job in playing Dr.Loomis, again. He was a true credit to the film series."
4,Another great sequel,"What does a horror icon, a bunch of shotgun loving red-necks, and a crazy doctor all have in common, A fun movie called Halloween 4. Michael is back and is scary as ever. He has escaped, once again, and he is heading back home. Loomis is also still alive from Halloween 2, and is right on Michael's tail. Loomis fears Michael will find Laurie's daughter, Jamie. It's a fun movie and does have it's scares."
2,Mostly bland installment but not as cheesy as part 2,"A respectable comeback for Micheal has some scares and a few shocks(the ending is great and dove tails back to the origin of the evil of Micheal Myers)but other than that this is just a typical eighties slash'em up with some mild gore and music alternating between dumb and spooky. Rachel is likable as was Laurie in the original,and captures some of her wholesome,All American girl charm.Daniel Harris is cute in the lead role(Mikey's 8 year old niece).The Myers mask is not as scary as it was in parts 1-2,but other than that,we see the old boy is still at the top of his form. Somewhat scary,and better acted than you might expect.Worth at least a rental."
3,OK I'm mad like everyone ELSE ...BUT,Ok Love both Halloween 4 & 5 but it was promise that it will contains DELETED SCENES but NO and I found out too late. F... BUT BUT.. I give it credit and decided to keep these blu-ray for both Halloween 4 and 5 because the Quality of the Blu-Ray Transfer was Great compare to the original Divimax ones I got. SO if you want to buy this for Quality wise then is worth it.
3,Just A Decent Sequel,"This halloween sequel is the second sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 classic. The movie itself had a good begining and ending. The plot was ok too. However this movie was not worth waiting seven years after Halloween 2 in 1981. The movie had its moments and refers to laurie strode by showing her pictures. This movie does not live up to the first two. The difference is that instead of chasing laurie strode, Michael Myers chases her Lauries daughter, Jamie. Ofcourse he kills anyone in is way. With Dr.Loomis returning it made this movie more interesting. Also Ellie Cornells acting was alittle shaky, nothing compared to Jamie Lee Curtis. This movie is great for die-hard halloween fans. For non-horror fans i'm not to sure but its worth the try."
2,Not nearly as good as the original.,"Halloween 4 will never compare to the original, classic Halloween. It almost disgraces the name. If it weren't for Dr. Loomis, this film would be put on the back shelf of all video stores."
3,"Not bad, but not great","This movie isn't terrible, but it's not all that good either. Michael looks like an inflated balloon and his mask looks ridiculous. Still, this movie had its moments. So I'm gonna be nice and give it 3 stars."
4,I'm gladly welcoming Michael back with open arms!,"I'm so glad to have Michael Myers back after a disappointing part III, which Michael wasn't in, and part III has also been disqualified from the HALLOWEEN series and is now called a ""non-sequel"".Anyway, part 4 focuses on Michael's 8-year-old niece, Jamie Lloyd, who is the daughter of Laurie Strode. Laurie is assumed dead after part II, so Jamie is living with foster parents and a foster sister. Jamie tries to lead a normal life, but can't escape the wrath of her ""funny uncle"". Even though she has never met Michael, all the kids at her school say ""you're uncle's the boogeyman"". But then, THAT NIGHT comes and HE comes home to kill again. Can Dr. Loomis save the day again? Can Jamie escape the evil power of Michael? Will Michael finally burn in hell? watch HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS to find out. It's a good sequel, expecially for the fourth installment in a series. (13 year old viewer.)"
5,Great,"My grand child and I watch these all of the time. She has watched these since she was 3 I believe. It was well worth purchasing every one except for number 3 which has nothing to do with her favorite person, (Michael Myers). I love watching these shows."
2,Review Based On Blu Ray... Not movie...,"Halloween 4 the movie I give 5 stars no doubt! This is completely based on the Blu Ray...While this looks better than my Divimax version, I was pretty much let down with this transfer. Extremely grainy. The sound sucks, it's just completely flat. There were a few good looking scenes, but is it worth the upgrade because Brady's shirt looks extra colorful in the drug store? lol. This is one of my favorite horror films of all time... But yeah, this Blu Ray is pretty weak.Seeing how great Shout Factory did with their transfer of Halloween 3, it's sad this release wasn't done the same way."
4,Halloween,Movie came packaged great and arrived at my door very quickly. As the Halloween movies progressed they definitely got worse. But I am a sucker for Halloween movies especially around the fall. I bought all of these for the season this year and tried to get through them all!
4,Halloween 4~is totally awesome,"As I already own Halloween 1 and 2, I recently rented Halloween 4, 5 and 6. I am amazed at how the story line was kept in order and how each movie explains it's self well. However I am very confused in the last Halloween H2O. It never says that Laurie Strode had a daughter, but she does have a son, John. And why did she give her daughter away and stage her death? Well, the staging of her death I understand, but why did she give up her daughter and why was it never mentioned in the last sequel? If anyone knows, please, please let me know. Claudia Klempau"
2,DIDN'T MICHEAL MYERS BURN IN PART 2???,"THIS MOVIE WAS DECENT AND SOMETIMES SCARY FOR A SEQUEL WITH SOME GOOD SCARES; BUT THEY NEVER DID EXPLAIN HOW THE GUY DIDN'T BURN TO ASHES AFTER PART 2, WHICH LEFT ME TO BELIEVE THEY WERE THINKING MORE WITH THERE WALLETS THEN THERE HEADS. THEY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE LEFT WELL ENOUGH ALONE, WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE HALLOWEEN H20 THAT MUCH BETTER. ."
3,A mildly entertaing sequel with an indulging horror mood,Halloween 4 is an enjoyable sequel filled with the by now familiar slashings by Michael and some suspense sequences. The film is one of the best sequels to the first (but ofcourse can't be compared to Carpenter's original) that will appeal to horror fans and fans of the series if they could forgive the few holes here in there.
3,Good,"This film is a good film. It's Micheal Meyers first appearance since halloween 2, where it picks up 10 years later in a hospital where micheal is in a coma and awakes and heads back to his home town where 10 years earlier he killed more that 15 people and almost his sister(Jamie lee Curtis). But instead of going after his sister he goes after his niece. This installment of halloween is a good sequal and techneically it is great but atmosphere isn't as strong as it was in the first two films."
2,"Cool beginning, but not that great after that.","The beginning scene where the paramedics are transferring Michael Myers (who has been in a coma for 10 years) is a very exciting scene. However from there the quality is not that great. It lacks entertainment values, the Friday the 13th series and Nightmare On Elm Street series always have. Also the Michael's mask is very cheap looking, whereas Michael's mask in 1&2 is very creepy and awesome. Also, The edgy look of John Carpenter's first two (aswell as his other movies) is gone here."
3,good but not great,I like all of the halloween movies but this one is boring until about halfway through. Im glad that Michael is back but i still would rather watch the first one. Danielle Harris is what really makes this movie good. She is a very good actress she is one of the reasons i didnt turn the movie off.
5,Amazing!,"Great seller! I received my DVD's in a short amount of time, just in time for Halloween!Thanks Again!"
4,True to Myers,"If you want the full horror scale of the HALLOWEEN spectacular, simply watch the first two, skip three, and watch this. Then, do not bother with any of the others. Originally, Carpenter and Hill wanted to make several movies which took place on Halloween but did not have to be related by story. The first HALLOWEEN story proved too long for one film, and thus we have 1 and 2. When they made 3 it was too late. People loved and desired more Mike. HALLOWEEN 4 comes in and gives us that satisfaction. It also gives us perfect closure in a full circle manner. Eerie, chilling, and atmosphereicly intense, this film asends above any other'part 4"" I've ever seen, while also being a fantastic addition and conclusion to an epic legend of terror. It is shamefull that several MORE sequels ruined this well rounded story."
3,Okay Movie,I didn't think this movie was very good at all. It was boring and just kept dragging on. I got it only because I collect the Halloween movies. I don't recommend this movie to anyone unless you are a hardcore Halloween fan.
3,Michael Myers has come home...again,"Ten years after we presumed Michael Myers and Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) dead in a fire, they've returned-but for obviously different reasons. Michael is in hot pursuit of his young niece(Danielle Harris), with Loomis determined to halt a repeat of ten years ago. This time, the police listen. Michael Myers isn't really scary here, and neither is the movie. Director Little mimics John Carpenter's use of darkness and atmosphere, and film tries hard, but never really gets off the ground. To his credit, Little doesn't sell out to the competition here and bombard us with blood and nudity. Good, but could have been great. Superior to the one that followed. Last but not least, Jamie Lee Curtis is sorely missed. It's too bad that Donald Pleasance didn't live to appear with her again in ""Halloween H20""."
3,Halloween all over again.,"In this 4th installment in the Halloween series, it appears that Michael Myers now has a niece, and now he will destroy her. I do admit, Danielle Harris does deliver a good performance, and Donald Pleasance is back as (the always likable) Dr. Loomis, but compared to the follow up, Halloween 5 (1989), there isn't as much suspense. I do recommend this movie for what it is, but ONLY for Halloween fans."
4,A great sequel,after the absence of the masked Killer Meyers is back for his niece. So is his doctor. It is a good movie.
4,"One of the best sequels, but also the beginning of the end","This film is probably one of the best written and most stylish Halloween films along with the first 3. Although I like this sequel, it seems to be more of the beginning of the 'let's turn michael into a jason-like cash-cow' phase. The film succeeds in scares and even some good thrilling action but falls short in some small corners with the true terror and build up that the first 2 really captured so well. The script is pretty good though, and Michael Myers is still looking scary, even though he looks very different than he did in the first 2...Not to mention he is noticeably stronger...much stronger, and more violent, and taller. But these things arent bad, theyre just different. It's a nice change, and this sequel is good. recommended"
5,It isn't a man,This is still the sequel to Halloween 2 over H20 for me. Dannielle Harris is just brilliant in this film at such a young age. Donald also delivers as usual. this brought the franchise to new heights and spawned two more good sequels.
3,Mediocre at best,"The kids are cute, and it's an interesting premise, but doesn't fit, especially after H20 was released (Jamie Lee Curtis' character Laurie had a son, not a daughter). Michael Myers' motivation for stalking his niece is never revealed, and the ending leaves it open for yet another bad sequel. The best thing about this version is that we get to see Donald Pleasance again."
4,Michael Myers is Back!!!!,"It always interests me on how people's tastes differ. Especially on sequels. Some people trash sequels and some people feel that some sequels are better than the original. I am not one of those people. As I looked over some of my movie reviews I saw that on my review of Halloween 3, some people found it helpful and some people just didn't agree with me. However, Halloween 4 is a good sequel. It brings back ""The Main Man"" Michael Myers and his Doctor Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasance).Michael is back for more terror in Haddonfield. This time hunting down his niece. Michael is always an entertaining sight and a great killer. He's strong, silent and destructive. A plot? Well if you've seen the first 2 then you already know the plot. Just replace Laurie Strode with her niece. I always enjoy the chase between Doctor Loomis and Michael.I will always be partial to the original, because it was just that, ""ORIGINAL"". I do, however, feel that Halloween 4 is well worth seeing."
1,This movie was lame!,Are all you people nuts? This was a very weak film. If John Carpenter is not involved in the writing or directing then don't buy a Halloween film. I and II are pretty much where the quality was. H20 was the best attempt since and that was like film # 7
3,Halloween 4,"Halloween 4 is worth seeing. It is a huge improvement over the third one. The acting is good, so is the special effects. The film was low bugdeted and filmed in Salt Lake City, Utah. The third Halloween film had nothing to do with Michael Myers, but the fourth one does. Nearly ten years after Halloween 2 Michael comes back to kill his necie Jamie. The fith one is more dissapointing, but the sixth and seventh one was better than four and five. Worth reniting, not buying."
4,Entertaining but not the best,Well some people would say this was the 3rd Halloween movie but I would like to use the term The 3rd Michael Myers Movie. It introduces Jamie Laurie's daughter who is Micheal Myers's niece. Micheal's a very bad uncle but the showdown between Jamie and Micheal isn't until the 5th movie. Then Michael kills her in the 6th one. I found it was weird that in Micheal Myers's hometown there are only two cops and they have to call for back up to save the town. Also they try to stop a bunch of bikers who are mad at Micheal to stop hunting for him but it was five of them against the two cops. They end up killing one of their friends who they mistaked for Myers. Then they help Jamie and her adopted sister Rachel to safty but all the bikers die and Jamie and Rachel are left all alone with Uncle Mikey. Luckily the cops come and save the day lucky for them. I would recommend this one for serious Halloween lovers because others might not understand the point.
2,Not Worth Your Time,"I absolutely hate this film. Most of it is boring, the death scenes are SO unrealistic (to kill one man, Michael forces his thumb into the guy's forehead, and it goes in like a knife or something), and Danielle Harris cannot act! She does tremindously better in Halloween 5, but she just hadn't learned to act when they made this film. Still, it's great to see Michael again..."
4,The 2nd best out of the Halloween series,"So returning to the 4th movie into the series with the 3rd movie having nothing to do with Michael Myers. I found it very entertaining to watch, especially the parts with Dr. Loomis in them. There is no Jamie Lee Curtis in the film, but still found it good without her, until the next film in the series which wasn't good and needed Curtis badly in it. I like the look of Michael in the film, his appearence is more buff and muscle toned, and the mask looks better too. Overall I rate the film 2nd best in the series next to the original one."
3,It was ok,Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is an okay sequel but nothing special. Michael Myers sister has died and now he's after Jamie played great by Dainelle Harris. Dwight H. Little has crafted a film with good camera work but the scares are little & few and the ending is choppy.
2,"Not the worst, but not great either.","I'll give it two stars for effort though (and for Donald Pleasance's performance + some other good acting). It is better than 3, 5, 6, and 8, but not really worth owning. I recomend you stick with the true Halloween trilogy of numbers 1, 2, and 7."
3,The best Halloween sequel! (*** 1/2 stars)...,"Although Halloween 2 is the scariest sequel of this series, Halloween 4 is really the best of them in writing, direction, production-quality, acting and charectors. It's almost as good as the first, but not quite. Halloween(1978)was ""ground-breaking"", while Halloween 4 is merely a sequel, but it's still very good, as well as entertaining. The acting is good, too, and Rachel and Jaime are great charectors. Defintely reccomended!"
4,Halloween 4 kick's butt!!!,"This was a great halloween. Great story and good horor sences. I'd say this movie wins for the best beggening and ending. In the beggening, HE DRIVES HIS THUMB THROUGH THIS GUY'S FOREHEAD, THAT'S AWSEOME. And the ending is a very good twist. Won't spoil it though, this was a great halloween."
3,"Despite what many reviewers say, still a good horror flick","H4 is a movie that is nowhere near as good as the first, but as good if not better than the second...Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis are back, and the storyline is alright as far as modern era horror flicks go. The ending is one that is good enough to send chills down the spine of every Halloween fan and any horror film enthusiast around...For a good horror flick that can be watched all the time and enjoyed despite what critics say, H4 is a good pick."
4,Another Michael Myers Slasher Flick Sucess.,"This movie was well written and decently acted I think that it was succesful, but no where as good as it's big brothers. END"
4,love this game!,"My little girl loves this game and easily learned how to play it. She is only four by the way, but has been playing it for the last year. It is one of her favorites and mine too. It is quick to play and we can easily play it three or four times in a row in less than a half hour. It is true that it does not fit properly back into the box, but that has not been an issue for us and it could be more sturdily made, as our button sticks once in a while. Even with the couple of things that could be better I would still recomend it. Even my 10 and 11 year old pull this one out to play."
5,Great game for young kids and parents too!,"My 3 and 5 year old daughters love this game and I like it too. It's great for pre-readers, but exciting enough to keep the whole family entertained. It helps build counting and number recognition skills for young kids, as well as helping them learn about playing board games - rules, taking turns, winning and losing. I highly recommend this game. It's a blast!"
1,piece of junk,"I wish I had read so many of the reviews before buying this ""game"". Yes, it lasted us about one game too before Daddy's tab broke and now, he won't stay down. But we did enjoy it for all of 10 minutes, thank you."
2,Faulty manufacturing of spring mechanism,"If it works and you have the right attitude, this can be a fun game for young kids. I love to pretend that I'm a kid and I WANT to wake Daddy up so he'll feed me. (""Wake up, Daddy. I'm hungry, Daddy,"" I say, as I push the button.) The kids laugh like crazy when I do this.However, buying this game over the internet or even in a store could turn out to be a major hassle for you. We had a game for a long time, but Daddy began to wake up after every single push of the button. I went and bought a new game at Toys R Us and, with that one, the button wasn't catching, so Daddy would never wake up. I took it back and exchanged it, and the same thing happened with this third game. The manufacturing of the spring inside Daddy or the ""catching"" mechanism is very faulty. I am taking this third one back and not bothering to try again. I've given up on Don't Wake Daddy."
1,Daddy Doesn't Wake Up on Either Game We Tried,"This game would be FANTASTIC if the mechanism worked. The first time out of the box we and our two boys (2 and 4 years) enjoyed it immensely though we thought it was strange that the Daddy never popped up. So we pushed the button around 500 times and he NEVER popped up. Okay, faulty game, back to the store. The second Don't Wake Daddy we brought home worked three times in a row, so we decided ""Hooray!"" and proceeded to assemble the rest of the game. Well, that was the only 3 times he worked. We never got him to pop up again. It's such a great idea, the way the board game part of it is played... but the manufacturer has some serious quality control problems. I give it one star because 2 out of 2 games tried failed to work. (I also gave it 4 stars for the potential for fun. Milton Bradley should really fix this game and make it work right!)"
5,No Batteries! Wow!,"My 4 year old received this game for Christmas and LOVES it. I love that it has no batteries and is still fun to play! My 2 year old likes to wake ""Daddy"" up by pushing the button. I am buying this game for a birthday present this month. I highly recommend it."
2,One word of caution,"I thought this was the cutest game when my 6 year old son suggested we get it for my 3 year old daughter. The concept is really cute and it's easy to play. The problem we ran into was totally unexpected. My daughter was TERRIFIED of the game! She was so excited to play until the first time the dad popped out of bed. She got scared and started crying and didn't want to play anymore. We put it away for about 6 months thinking maybe she was still too young. When we pulled it out again, she wanted to play but she wouldn't let anyone push the button on Dad's bed until she was watching from out of the room. We ended up giving the game away. This is a really cute game as long as your child isn't easily startled."
5,I had previously purchased this same game and it is a fun game to play.,"I was disappointed that I ordered 8 of these games and was told that there would be no shipping charges. However, I only received 1 and was charged almost $6 for shipping. Very disappointed that I didn't get the 8 that I had ordered."
2,Poor Quality,"This toy lasted all of one game. The 'Daddy' won't stay down. Also, the toy is too big and the box lid won't stay in place. This is too bad because the game is very cute and fun for everyone. My kids were real disappointed."
4,"Good game but can end up being a very, very long game!","This is a neat game and the concept is great however, it can end up being very, very, very long! Especially if you play with more than one other person because the cards get dealt so thinly, and you land on spaces and you have to push the alarm clock so often. I once played a game that lasted an hour and a half! Now I'm not complaining about that fun that I had with my family but, this is not the sort of game you can just sit down and play a quick round of. You have to be in it for the long haul! Still a great game that teaches numbers, counting, and ever a little bit of colors...if you have the patience."
1,Don't wake daddy--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This game was really fun for the kids for the five minutes it lasted. Technical problems with Daddy and the latch that holds him down...very frustrating for my 3 year old who really wanted to play more than twice...I might return it but I certainly will pick something else...disappointed, thumbs down!"
1,Worst...Game...Ever,"I hate this game. Okay, I know it's made for little kids, but this game is dull beyond dull,. The ""daddy"" is very cheaply made. Ours quickly became hair-trigger sensitive, and now always pops up after only 1 or 2 pushes on the button. Since ""daddy"" get's awoken on almost every single turn, and since every time he wakes, the player who's turn it is has to go back to start, you can imagine how long this game can take to finish! My daughter asked for this game for Christmas, but every time she asks to play, I wish this particular gift had fallen off of Santa's sled. I wish we'd gotten her Perfection instead."
1,Taking advantage of people,Shame on you Amazon for taking advantage of people!! Really? $59.99 for Don't Wake Daddy!!! YOU JUST LOST A CUSTOMER!! I will NEVER shop on your website again!!!
1,Shipping Problem,Usually available from Toys R Us for shipping within 24 hours could be slightly misleading. If you are ordering for this or other items to be shipped to your Nephew across the country (even if you order a month ahead of time as I did). Don't count on him getting a present from you this year.
4,"Great game, watch price",This game is great. It is a fun game for children or to play with the family. If it is priced over $25 it is over priced.
4,Silly game,"The kids seem to love this game, even though I as an adult thought it was pretty silly. Kids love to get this out out play it. I think the suspense of when daddy will pop out of bed and send his nightcap flying has them hooked."
5,Dope,"This was a pretty dope cop. I have been listening to it for a week straight and I gotta say this album is probably one of the better hip hop albums I've heard in a while. I enjoy the lyrical content, the many number of mc's blessin the mic, and a pretty good production. Overall I dig this album a lot. If you're tired of the same ol same ol in the hip hop game I would definitely check this out."
5,First issue arrived earlier than expected!!,"I bought a subscription to MacWorld for my son as a birthday gift and was told that the first issue would probably not arrive until late April or even as late as mid-May, but he had it the last week in March! That was exciting. I felt bad he'd have to wait so long since his birthday was March 18th. As it turned out it came only a few days after that! Thanks Amazon and MacWorld!"
5,MacWorld Magazine,MacWorld is required reading for the serious Mac user. It reports the latest changes in Mac software and hardware from both Apple and third-party vendors. Reviews of the latest products are essential so that you can decide when to upgrade your existing system.
4,Good reading for Mac newbies and experts,"In every issue I always find a good review, and very good tips on making me more productive with mi Mac Mini."
5,a great mag,"This monthly mag has lots of reviews, articles stuffed with information, and speaks to the variety of levels of experience in using Apple products. I look forward to reading each issue and I find myself searching through their website for back issue articles to help me on a project."
3,"informative, but cheap looking","I love macs so I wanted to know more about them and the products that go with them and enhance their outcome. For this, Macworld is great. Articles about current issues, advices on additional functions, reviews, tips and recommendations. But the magazine feels cheap, with very thin paper and many ads which are small formats and make the pages look mess. It was a bit of visual disappointment I must admit."
4,PC on Kindle but not Mac ?? Need this on Kindle,"I like this magazine, not great but very good. Would recommend but still wish that we could view Mac World on the iPhone via the Kindle app and/or viathe Kindle by itself. PC World is offered why not Mac World????"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!,"I have NEVER received this magazine after I used the Auto renewal, I have asked to have it corrected over & over again, with NO LUCK!I have had a subscription for years.It use to be my favorite, however, I have NOT received a copy after I renewed the subscription...:-(I am very DISAPPOINTED Macworld! :-("
5,"Good magazine, great service",First time I had ever dealt with a third party regarding a magazine subscription. First issue arrived in time frame as promised.
5,The Mac Bible,"Not much I can say about this product. I consider it THE product to let us know what's going on in the Mac world. There are other magazines that do a really good job, but this is the top of the line."
2,Did not renew,This didn't automatically renew so I am quite disappointed. I have always thought Macworld is the better of the 2 popular Mac publications but now not so sure.
3,Mac mag,Perfect for anyone who owns a mac. I still have my PC along with PC World which I love. Macworld triesto do same but somehow does not have the same feel. Maybe I read PC World too long?
1,Solid for the price,"Good subscription for the price but only comes once a month, very thin at best and always loaded with ads and very little content BUT if you only paid like $6 like me it is worth it."
3,Informative,this magazine is informative as it gives you a lot of info on the latest technological resources on the market. But I guess I expected more information on the inner workings of the Mac products rather than just a listing of what they have.
4,"Beyond the ""Milky Way""","The bad news first: in all the years since The Church's most compelling song, ""Under the Milky Way,"" they still haven't duplicated that masterpiece, and that's true of this disc and every cut on it. The good news: this is a mostly beautiful, haunting piece of work, and no other group has a sound like The Church's, a pop-rock mix that's so atmospherically rich, so dreamy. This disc is one of those rare ones that's equally pleasant to listen directly to or just put on as a background soundscape. Like other Church efforts, there's a sameness to too many cuts, and the lead singer's voice here has been diminished by age -- he sounds more like Mark Knopfler than ever before. But still better. And still good."
4,Promises,"""Song For the Asking"" is the usual-beautiful for these guys. ""Chromium"" is a nice Willson-Piper track to round things out.I give the album four stars because it might be time that the Church could once again benefit from a ""second set of eyes""--the restraint of the song 'After Everything,' for example, should've just been let loose with horns and a faster tempo...I don't know, compressed intervals...whatever...somehow the pace could develop more strength thru the album progression if it had more hierarchy. I know what these guys are capable of, so I'm not going to kiss their ----- (that's plural)All in all, though, I enjoy the album----decide for yourselves"
5,Very convenient!,Came before expected. Brand new for a great price. This has been missing from my collection for a while after it got stolen. Glad to have it back!!!!
3,"After ""Numbers,"" just OK.","The unremarkable ""After Everything Now This,"" followed the superb ""Hologram of Baal,"" which was the best Church album since ""Starfish,"" and one of their best albums, period. It may have been unrealistic for fans to expect the same quality. In fact, the first song, ""Numbers,"" released as a single before the release of the album, is powerful and memorable, and equals anything on ""Hologram."" Unfortunately, once you get past ""Numbers,"" AENT, for the most part, meanders along with mostly average unmemorable songs.While I do like ""After Everything,"" ""Chromium,"" and ""Night Friends,"" I don't think they're even close to the band's best work. The other tracks don't make much of an impression, and some songs could use some serious editing.If ""Numbers"" had been on ""Hologram of Baal,"" instead of this album, I would probably consider ""Hologram,"" the best Church album of all. Unfortunately, on AENT, that song is somewhat ""dumbed down"" by rest."
5,"Quirky & Brilliant, As Usual","Easily the band's best work since Starfish, if not Seance. ""Song for the Asking"" and ""The Awful Ache"" deserve inclusion alongside ""Disappear?"" ""Reptile,"" and ""Grind"" among the greatest they've ever written, and nothing's more pleasing than blissing out to ""After Everything"" and ""Invisible"" (I love that insistent string-scraping timekeeper in the background...it's hypnotic). If you stopped listening to the Church after ""Under the Milky Way"" fell off the charts, this is the record you want to use to catch up with them."
2,Family Archives Review,"While the instructions read simple to use, I find it not that way. I have yet to get the CD # 354 to perform as expected, according to the instructions."
1,Archives,"Could not get to work with computer, need to return. Another person had purchased this and it didn't work either."
3,Before you Buy,"First off I suscribe to the Magazine. I personally Enjoy reading it. I agree there are alot of advertisments, but this is a commerical publication and has about the same ad as other magazines.Now, This Magazine is not for Beginers, Or Novices, For people who focus soley on Natural bodybuilding, Nor Is it for Athletes who competively plays sports. This Magazine focuses On a specific demographic- Powerlifter, Bodybuilders and enthusists Of the sport/art. It also focues and reaching goals through legal supplements and drinks. The excerises and routines In the magazine, or geared towards people with intermediate to advance knowledge of lifting.I DO NOT recommend this magazine for anyone starting out or wants a natural path to bodybuilding. I DO recommend this for those individuals who are competitvely bdoy building and those who have a good base of knnowledge on Lifting"
1,Best Mag for Serious Lifter's- NOT.,"Mainly out of curiosity i picked up the current issue (June) of Muscle & Fitness. Ironically on the cover it says 'Our Biggest Training Issue' BUT out of 289 pages a whopping 167 of them contain full page ads for food supplements (and i didn't even count the pages with half and 1\4 page adds), including one which will make you 'gain size and strength 344% faster', and another which will 'grow muscle while you sleep'. The other 102 pages consisted of an article on 'supplements to help you sleep better', 'American pin-up girls', the Rock's training program which has you training 5 days a week with 20 sets for the arms and no squats or deadlifts, Aaron Madrons new secret chest routine, oversized photos of the 'champs' and other related nonsense. [In my opinion,] this [magazine] is NOT the place to find sensible training info for typical drug free people. Please read books by Stuart Mc Robert and other good authors all available from this site. Peace."
1,It's like reading spam mail,"Literally, 95% of magazine is advertisement for dietary supplements (most of it is with Muscle Tech).Pages and pages of spam... sometimes of the same product from the same company will place these advertisements in the first couple of pages, then in the middle, and then at the end of the magazine.If you are looking for pictures of bodybuilders screaming like they are having a roid rage episode, this is prefect magazine for you.If you are looking for new weight lifting techniques to freshen up your workout routines, definitely look elsewhere."
3,I liked it better in the past,"I subscribed to Muscle and Fitness Hers and really enjoyed a weighlifting magazine geared toward women. When they discontinued it was with the promise we'd get plenty of articles of our own in Muscle and Fitness. But this magazine has turned into one large ad. The articles are still useful, but there are too many ads now and not enough tips and advice for women bodybuilders."
1,Has Been,Five to seven years ago this would have been the premier Bodybuilding magazine to read. Today is a different story. It resembles a men's magazine closely related to Maxim and it's material is stale and wornout. I'm canceling my subscription of 9 years it's gotten so bad. Commercialism at it's worst. Don't bother because it's not worth it.
1,For all of you ad lovers,"If you enjoy reading ads while browsing through magazines, then this is the magazine for you. The articles are pretty much the same every month with different bodybuilders demonstrating routines that we have all seen before. Save your money."
1,"Waste of money, time, and effort reading this mag","How many times can you write the same article over and over again and call it something different? Muscle and Fitness has been doing it for many years now. Eats lots of protein! Don't overtrain! Take our supplements! Look at 125 pages of Muscle-Tech ads!It's insane. Not only is this book 1/2 filled with ads for supplements that do nothing, the pages are also filled with meatheads that are on $10,000 worth of steroids per month. The fact is, the routines in this magazine are targeted towards those who use the drugs.Other than the ""latest in nutrition and health"" section, this magazine never changes from year to year. And of course, the latest in nutrition updates are all biased to begin with. How can anyone say milk is good for you these days after everything that's been exposed in the dairy industry?What a waste!"
1,Rip-Off!,"I'm referring to the U.K version of this magazine but my sentiments are the same as that written by most of the other reviewers. This mag has deteriorated so much over the last few years. I recent;y discouraged my son from reading this magazine as it almost resembled a soft porn mag! Also, if you were to follow the routines in this magazine, you will just end up overtrained and frustrated with your lack of results. Why? the rotuines listed here only work if you have 6 days a week and two hours a day to train. and it also requires that you live on supplements! Most of the 'champs' feautured in this magazine are just paid to say they use the supplements. in reality they are all surgically enhanced and are on large amounts of anabolic hormones. There is no way the routines in this mag will work for typical people. please look elsewhere!"
1,Good for some...maybe,"Definetly aimed at pro bodybuilders, not the average person who wants to trim up or just get a that nice cut body. Almost all ads, few stories of interest, and even fewer images to help along. I'd check out other heath magazines at your local Barns and Nobel, or Borders to see what works for you. This one's too caught up in selling magazines, than giving you relevant info."
2,more advertisement then fitness,"i am a mens health reader after my subscription expired i decided to try this magazine as its seen all over news stand .. man what was i thinking, they hardly show you great work out, shows you some tip...the emphasis is on advertisement and girls.. for fun i started to count how many pages of advertisement were in the magazine, the magazine was about 160 ish.. pages and about 90ish were advertisement thats about 60% of magazine filled with advertisement.. and they wanna charge $40 a year for this lol..definately not worth it... unless u get it from discount magazines.. dont bother not worth the money .."
3,More about Harris than about Bellow,"This is a kind of mixed-up book ostensibly about Saul Bellow and his work , but it seemed to me, more about Mark Harris and his. There is information about Bellow's life and also some analysis of his work. But I found this book to be one of the poorer efforts on the work and life of Bellow that I know."
2,For Iggy fanatics only,"There is little literature available for Italian Greyhound fanatics/owners. Therefore, this slender tome is going to be tempting. The breed is endlessly entertaining, fascinating, and different, so reading personal stories is inevitably going to appeal to the Iggy owner/ed. Obviously self-published, this book isn't very good, in spite of the subject matter. The illustrations aren't all that great either. The ability to write well, and to write entertainingly isn't evenly distributed, and it rather missed this author. She obviously loves her Iggy, and is trying to write a funny little book, but she misses the mark."
1,Undistinguished and Vapid Scholarship at its Best,"Continuing a theme that he has so adeptly developed over the course of his ""academic"" career, Kahn, long the paragon of philosophical pomposity, provides a work that is as pompous and fake as his affected English accent. The inarticulate Kahn once again makes his reader wonder if he possesses any capabilities of basic reasoning at all, basing his entire thesis on the kind of unsubstantiated leaps that are the hallmark of grade school essays. Your time would be better spent taking a fork to your own eye; it would be less masochistic than reading ""Anaximander""."
5,Nice for company but not too practical,"This item is impressive when served to guests but is not practical for everyday use because it only holds so many toothpicks and takes a few moments to refill. I am still happy to have it for when entertaining, while using a simple holder for everyday purposes."
4,Poor Prinny,"This book was the first I've read that presents a balanced picture of the Regent. He had many unattractive qualities but they were the shortcomings of someone who never really grew up, a lifelong adolescent. He had some finer traits that might have served him perfectly well if he'd been a private gentleman instead of the heir to the throne. I was particularly interested in the theory that the Regent suffered to a lesser extent the hereditary disease that most historians believe caused George III's madness."
2,Misleading,"I'm past halfway and feel I know enough of the book to judge. The title, subtitle and back copy are misleading. This book offers far more political history than cultural history and the focus on the Prince himself wavers so often I found myself wanting to sit Saul David or his editor down and deliver a stern talking-to. Prince of Pleasure? Prince of Politics is more like it, with one endless shuffle of the cabinet after another. As if that weren't enough, the writing is flat, though at times David gets slangy or jokey as if aware of his prosaic style. And as a historian, he;s inconsistent: we get endless gross detail about how unclean and unhygienic Princess Caroline was, yet she goes on to have many lovers--did no one else besides her husband and some courtiers early on ever comment? Or did she have a soap-related epiphany? Inquiring minds want to know."
3,Sad and silly person,"He started off pretty, but it was only skin deep. He was vain and greedy. He was particularly irksome to both wives (secret and catholic Mrs Fitzherbert, ""respectable"" but dizzy Princess Caroline). But no-one is all bad - he loved his daughter, enjoyed parties and built a few memorable buildings. What a waste of a life. Despite the horrible cover, this is a solid book on the Prince Regent which will be read (or glanced at) by regency buffs the world over."
4,Richardson spares the Boiler Room bravado.,"There is no better tool for a sales coach than the Richardson series. I am not fond of Guru books in general, but I have used Richardson's books to coach sales teams, and gotten results. Salespeople at every level fail to integrate skills like checking into their presentations, but most think they do. Too much ""telling"" happens during presentations, e.g. most salespeople see an interruption by a client as rudeness rather than an opportunity, and respond accordingly. Richardson's tools help coaches manage even the most seasoned sales pros to their potentials. If you are looking for motivation, this series is not the ticket; the success stories focus on the sales process, not results. However, I have seen salespeople become better personal communicators after attending Richardson's seminars, while achieving better sales results; I do not think this was just a coincidence."
1,Terrible,Does not work properly. Tried different bulbs etc. Lots of flickering. I would NOT recommend.
1,Didn't Work #2,"As I stated in my other review this is a great idea but it didn't work, this one only worked 1 day."
4,Scissors,Item was as described. Arrived very quickly. Perfect timing. We use it for picture opportunities for ribbon cuttings. It shows up well in the pictures.
2,Informative?,This book was not informative at all to me. Wish it was as I am very into arts and crafts.
4,fourth grader,try it please. it is very good. i luv to read and arts and crafts this is a perfect combo.it is worth trying i guess
2,Not a great script,"I have reviewed a few other Hermie movies and this one is one of my least favorite. My son is nearly 4 years old, so maybe if he were a bit older, I would feel differently. I did not like this script because I found it very harsh and the characters didn't seem to be very forgiving. I am not opposed to reading or watching things that deal with lying, cheating, etc. (obviously since I bought this movie) however, I just really expected it to be more about the forgiveness and changing of the heart rather than being so focused on the lying. My other issue with Hermie, and again I have several movies, is that there is no word about Jesus. HE is the reason for the Bible and for our salvation and I wish I could find early childhood videos that talked about HIM!!"
5,Big Fan,"OK im 26 and Im a big fan so is my 4 year old daughter we have almost the whole collection I love because each movie come with a nice little lesson like sharing, telling the truth and so on and a catchy song but i especially like them because it teaches encourages kids and adults to pray"
2,compilation,This compilation is not really worth buying. You're better off getting the originals. They're all worth it!
2,brittle and smudgy,Lead broke easily. the line was dark and smudgy and didn't erase well (you could still see the pigment on the paper)with the eraser on the pencil. It just wasn't what I was looking for in a .5mm mechanical pencil. I had another one before that worked great. (I can't remember the brand and model now though)
4,It does its job.,"I would ONLY use these pencils throughout high school. I would ""cap it off"" with a cap eraser so I could reuse my BIC mechanical pencil over and over again. I love the thin .5 mm lead because it is so precise. The lead is super pointy & painful if you ever happen to stab yourself by accident. Sometimes when writing it will make a squeaky annoying sound caused by the lead writing on paper. Also, they do not last very long. The lead dispenser usually gets messed up. But for the price, it's a good purchase."
4,mechanical pencils with grip,My highschooler will only use mechanical pencils. In this day and age teachers don't usually like students to sharpen pencils during class anyway. There a variety of colors. The grips are comfortable. She hasn't complained about the lead breaking like she usually does with mechanical pencils. The plastic seemed a little thin or flimsy to me but she hasn't said anything about them breaking and she is hard on her supplies. She seems very satisfied with them. I would buy them again.
2,no difference,"Completed the bottle. Never saw any difference in skin or joint health. On the bright side, it also did not cause any bad side effects. Have found choline makes a difference in my joint pain."
3,Wrong description,"It says double strength on the bottle with 60 caps, but it is the same 100mg HyaluronicNow Foods - Hyaluronic Acid, 60 veggie capsas the other, just the price is almost double. The other ones that I have ordered have 100mg of Hyaluronic acid PLUS MSM."
2,It's not double strength,"Not double strength, it's normal strength sold for twice the cost. Other than that, I am still using this for my broken bones and didn't notice much difference so far."
5,My favorite supplement,"I have periodically taken supplements and this is far and away my favorite one. My chiropractor recommended it to me and I am so glad he did. My skin, nails, and hair are always better when I take this on a regular basis."
4,Joint Pills,I can't tell for sure but taking these pills and also wearing a brace is making my elbow easier to move and less pain.
2,No noticeable difference.,"This came highly recommended, but I am not getting relief with a torn rotator cuff. I'm taking with glucosamine & condroitin, MSM and high doses of vitamin C. Do you have any experience with this? Recommendations?"
3,Works only in Conjunction...,"...with a pharmaceutical-grade or USP glucosamine or chondroitin supplement, along with Sea Cucumber which provide tremendous and fast relief (within 24 hours) from a painful arthritic condition I have in my hips. Hyaluronic acid by itself did nothing for me, but it appears only to work as a partner with other joint relief ingredients. I've tried this product, as well as other store brands of similar composition that contain glucosamine and chondroitin. I've also taken Shark Cartilage, MSM, Celedrin, Tart Cherry Concentrate, cod liver oil, Reservatrol, Black Cohosh, White Willow Bark, Passionflower, Burdock root, Dandelion root, ibuprofin, aspirin, acetaminophen, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and Celbrex. So I know what actually works, and what doesn't."
4,MEMORY LANE,"this is not episodes these are three tapes that stroll down memory lane and they last 70 minutes. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE GOOD. I grew up in grosse pointe MI and watched them forever, now my kids can enjoy.. which they do and they are 8 and 6 They also enjoyed watching new zoo review. Is it possible the shows I watched in the 70s were more intelligent that what my kids can watch today??? yes. Which is why I have searched high and low for these DVDS they totally rock if you did not grow up with them you will love them. I watched and cried my way through he was like the dad I never had. YOU SHOULD GET THESE DVDS ! they do not cater to kids like the new shows do they do not imply kids are stupid. They really challenge thinking and imagination."
4,Cootie for a grandchild,"I have loved this product since I was a child. Bought it for a four-year-old grandchild. Wonderful that it still looks the same. Can't wait to play Cootie with him.Sue Rogers, Columbus, Georgia"
2,Hard to fit parts; too long for a 3 year old; too frustrating for a 5 year old,"The object of the game is to build a cootie-- body, head, legs, eyes, etc. A person must first roll a one to get a body, then a two to get a head, then other numbers to get other parts. This afternoon it took FOREVER for my 5 year old to roll a one, then a two. (She wouldn't play any other way except by the rules, and those are the rules). My 3 year old couldn't concentrate long enough to get enough parts to build a cootie, although he did pretty well. We finally stopped and just built cooties. The parts don't fit well. Little kids need help putting in the parts, and the parts fall out too. Not fun."
1,Don't Bother,"Teaches patience but that's about it. Our kids are 4 and 3, and we were all bored out of our minds waiting for specific numbers on the dice. The parts fell off constantly, too. Many better choices out there. We'll be returning it!"
2,"Cheap game, I was dissapointed","My daughter loved building the bugs in this game, but the game itself is cheaply made. I had to toss three of the legs and one body piece because it is so cheaply made that the legs break off in the body. Some of the pieces are also difficult for small fingers (I have a 4 year old) to put into the bugs themselves. What dissapointed me most was that cost for replacement parts is equal to or more than just buying a new version of the game altogether. We liked the Cootie game until it broke, and now my opinion is that its just a cheap, worthless game because it doesn't hold up very long at all. My daughter is gentile, and doesn't have many things break on her, so for this game to break on her (and I) in the middle of a game, it was a real downer for Mommy & Daughter game night."
2,"Not very fun, poor quality","I and my 4 year old son haven't found this game to be that much fun, but I've found it to be of poor quality as parts fit loosely or too tight (heads may easily fall off the body) and male attachment parts too easily break off and get left in the holes.Also, ""MADE IN MEXICO WITH DIE MADE IN CHINA""."
2,"looks cute, but just doesn't cut it as a game","I always wanted Cootie as a kid, so I bought it for my son after loving ""Don't Break the Ice."" As a game, it is unfortunately, too long and drawn out for what it is. If you play it by the game directions, it is too long for a three-year-old, and too boring for an older child (or adult). We've decided it's a toy. But unfortunately, as a toy, it is very breakable. The first time my 3-year-old son played with it, he broke many pieces. On the upside, Milton Bradley was great with replacing parts.Furthermore, it is not a good game or a toy for young children, because the pieces are difficult to fit into the holes, and my 3-year-olds have not been able to do so. My little girl who turns five next month could not put the legs in today. And the head keeps falling off the body while you're holding the cootie. I was thinking today that I should discourage people from making this purchase!"
2,Frustrating for different reasons...,"This game could be easily frustrating to 3-6 yrs old, or even to adults.1) The rule of the game: once you get some parts on the body, numbers on dice you can put more parts on get limited very quickly. (Roll a 1 and pick a body, roll a 2 and select a head, roll a 3, etc. - so second/third time when you ""roll a 1"" you have nothing to do) This concept could be very frustrating to the little kids. You cannot do anything until you get certain number on the dice... I changed the rule for my kids. Waiting game was too boring for mine.2) The parts are not flimsy but still cheap as other reviewers said. Meaning, some holes are too big for the parts (keeps falling off) and some are too small (legs or the bug won't fit in to the board or body!). Small kids would have hard time putting the parts in.Oh, well, I was at the toy store when I bought this game and didn't read any reviews. Next time I will check the reviews for sure. Don't recommend it..."
1,Terrible Quality - To Slow Going,"Usually, when I write a review it's in praise of a product. This is the first time that I have logged onto my computer, specifically to write a bad review. This afternoon, I sat down to play Cooties with my daughters (3 and 5). I remember playing this game when I was a kid and was looking forward to playing it with my girls. They were so excited to play the game and to put all the pieces together. As it turned out, the plastic pieces were of extremely shoddy. None of them fit together properly. Either they were too loose so they didn't stay connected, or they were too tight and broke off when you tried to connect them. So rather than enjoy some quality time together, we all ended up frustrated. I threw the game out before even one Cootie got built."
1,NOT what I remember,"Not sure if I just didn't care when I used to play this but it is not what I remembered. I ordered this for my 3 1/2 year old son, and while he was just as excited as I was, the heads do not stay on the body and it took us FOREVER to roll a one just to get a body and head. And nevermind trying to keep rolling sixes to get all the legs. How do you explain to a 3 1/2 year old that you just have to pass the die back and forth until one of you rolls a six in order to just get a leg. We just build them and they now live mostly on his Aircraft Carrier :), even though they're headless most of the time. Yes it was a blast from my childhood, but just look at the picture if you need an 80s fix."
4,Fun for kids.. boring for adults,"Like all games for this age group, parents must play withe the children and they will quickly bore. The parents, not the kids. The kids will love. I recommend for the patient, tolerant parent."
3,Ok for the price,"I bought this game for my daughter who was three at the time. She liked the bugs and the idea of putting them together. However, the fact that the pieces kept coming apart really frustrated her and prevented her from enjoying the game. Eventually she just got annoyed with it. I think she played it a grand total of two times. But, like it was said before...what do you expect for the price? I think it would be much more enjoyable for young kids if the parts would stick together a little better."
1,"Should be fun, but isn't. It's JUNK.","Okay, it's Cootie. Most of us know the game. Fun, right? Well, it should be, but it isn't.One of our kids received this as a gift about 2 years ago. We did try to play it several times, but it was nothing but frustrating. The little parts were so poorly made that the legs and such did not stay in tightly and kept falling out. This was unbelievably disappointing for the kids. It was really just about unplayable. I had to get rid of it.Maybe we were just unlucky or maybe they're making this cheaply these days. I don't know. All I can say is I wouldn't waste your money finding out. There are plenty of better games out there.Junk!"
2,Mother,I think the old cooties was much easier to put together. There are to many pieces. Better for older children.
3,Bring back the CLASSIC COOTIE shape! It was very cool.,"The new cootie is too round. The original was really alien looking, but cute. I want a set of original ones to clue together and have crawling up my wall! And, I'm 50 years old!! PS- Bring back the original, 30's style CLUE board and cards. The new one is too cartoonish."
3,cootie uh-oh,"my two girls ages 3 and 18 mo, love this game. they enjoy putting the bugs together and of course fight over who gets which parts.The DOWN SIDE- the parts don't stay together. Every two minutes (or less) the girls are saying ""uh-oh"" or ""help please"" because on of the billion pieces included has fallen off. They haven't yet gotten frustrated with this, I guess because when a piece falls off they can just make a new combination by choosing a different part. However, it's frustrating for me because the purpose of the game (sometimes) is to occupy them, and allow me time to get something done- the only thing I'm getting done is assisting in bug assembly.Come on hasbro/milton bradley you are a big company and should be able to make a simple game that's been around for years work right. Please!"
3,"Fun Game, Very Poor Quality",My 3 yo son loves this game and has a ton of fun with it. He's even having fun playing with the game alone during his quiet time.The big problem: I wish game makers would stop using the cheapest plastic and paper they can find. The peices don't fit properly into the cootie bodies and many either fall off or can't be squeezed into the holes. It's so frustrating. Two of the small peices broke off and are still stuck in the holes in the cootie body so we can't use those pieces or the body anymore. What a dissapointment.
1,Frustration,"I bought this game for my three kids (3 year old twins and a 6 year old) thinking it would be a great game for them to play together. It could be fun, but the fact that the pieces are constantly falling out makes it incredibly frustrating. When I play with them, I spend all of my time putting their cooties back together because the head, legs, lips, keep falling out of the body. The board fell apart after about two games also. Milton Bradley should be ashamed to be putting out a product that is of such poor quality. In my opinion it is worthless and I certainly wouldn't recommend buying it. Try finding the classic version on ebay. This is the first time that I've felt so strongly about a product that I've bothered to write a review of it."
5,Really great game for younger children!,This is such a great game for younger children that still can't read. The only reading is of the directions for the adults. The children roll the die and each number corresponds with bug body parts that they have to collect to form the ultimate Cootie. Very funny and cute.
4,Cootie,Game was a Christmas gift for a family. They seem to enjoy. Easy to order and game was shipped promptly.
4,OK toy. Tampered with???,"This toy is fine. Blast from the past and all that. Fun for little kids. But, my particular Cootie came in a ripped, bent, dented box. When I opened it, ( which was easy since the box was a mess ) Cootie parts were already seperated from the plastic holders and strewn all over the box. Messy. Luckily, all the parts were there or I'd be returning it. Unusual for Amazon."
1,disappointed,Shame on Hasbro. The quality of this game is very bad. Do not buy it as you will be very disappointed. The pieces are either too large to fit in or they are too loose and fall out. This is a company that should go out of business
3,A Great Blast From The Past But Not Good For Little Ones,"I recently ordered Milton Bradley's ""Ants In The Pants"" and ""Cootie Bug"" games for my 3 year old son. These games were a total blast from the past and I just had to get them when I saw them on your site. Ants In The Pants is great but Cootie Bug is NOT good for this age group. I was so disappointed because the game has too many little pieces, is a little more complicated than I remembered, and the game board was in pieces in minutes (flimsy cardboard). Suprisingly enough, my 3 year old son is really careful with his toys and is not ""destructive"" by any means. And although this toy was not expensive, it was a waste of money for his age group.Just wanted to provide some feedback and possibly save some other parents some money. Wait until your kids are 4 or 5 for this one."
2,I like the old version better.,"We purchased this game for my daughter. She is only 2 1/2, but we figured it would be fun to just try and put together the legs, eyes etc. My husband and I were so disappointed in this game. You just keep rolling for legs basically. The eyes are one unit now. The head kept falling off of the bodies. The lips on mine fell off throughout the entire game. None of us could get the legs into the holes without a huge effort. We knew that our daughter might have difficulty with the game at her age, but we never anticipated the trouble we would have. I would not waste my money on this game. It isn't one we be able to use in the future. The quality is very poor. They took a fun game and made it very frustrating."
3,A Classic - remade cheaply as is all to common these days,"My kids 4 & 6 got this for Christmas. It is a classic game, but the parts, box and board are all much cheaper & flimsy than they used to be. The bugs are hard to get to stand up. It was somewhat frustrating for the kids if you followed the rules and had to roll a 1 and then a 2 with the dice to get started building the bug. When the 4 of us played it, some had their bug practically built and others were still waiting to even start and had not rolled the first required number. It doesn't always seem ""fair"" to the younger ones to see others so far ahead, strictly based on luck & roll of the die. There is no real skill or learning here in succeeding in playing the game and winning."
3,Not as fun as other similar games,It gets frustrating for my 3 year old to roll the dice and not be able to add to his bug. He prefers to play with it as a bug building toy and not as the game itself.
5,"""Flag"" - a review","""Flag"" is the kind of book serious students of American history will love. Marc Leepson has written an account of our nation's most enduring symbol that includes all the scholarly elements but still brings a popular history to those of us that wouldn't know a monograph from a monorail. The book begins with the initial uses of flags in our nation's history through the controversey surrounding its creation up through its modern day use as a statement of patriotism and politics. The book hits all the highlights and some of the abuses without being overly pedantic or preachy. Leepson has accomplished a rare feat - bringing scholarship to the masses and doing so in a delightfully entertaining way. It is exactly the kind of history that should be read by everyone who has an interest in our nation's history - and that should be all of us."
5,A very nice evening read - Very Interesting,"Mr. Leepson has done a wonderful job in a very unique way...Biography(s) are usually the domain of people, persons or groups...he has done this with our American Flag.He handles the controversial in a very understandable way (dare I say ""Fair and Balanced"", but I digress)...While nothing can gas up a crowd a veterans faster than someone abusing our Flag, Mr. Leepson even handles the Flag burning issue with an excellent review of court review to date...For the historians in the crowd, he has put to rest the alot of the fiction about the developement of the first flag ('a.k.a. the Betsy Ross Flag')...for one who has read a lot about our First President, George Washington, he has 'Weemed' out the falsehoods of the original developement.He is the author of many books, but his latest on the Marquis LaFayette is also a wonderful read...see my review of that book!Ed652Gray"
2,"Four in One: Rhetoric, Reader, Research Guide, and Handbook (4th Edition)",It could be the way the teacher is teaching the class because we hardly ever use the book and what parts that I've used seemed to be somewhat helpful. I'm just not too happy with the book.
1,Not for novice,No got for learning Java at all. This was a complete waste of money for some one like me who just wanted to learn the basics. Might be useful for a skilled Java programmer who wants to improve technique.
1,Not Rock N Roll,This wasn't the guy I expected but I gave the album a chance. I've tried to listen to it and have yet to make it through the entire CD.
1,Extremely misleading,"I think Amazon.com should be held accountable for misleading people into thinking this is a Chris Daughtry album. Chris Daugherty's album should NOT be listed on this page, especially sandwiched in between a group of Chris Daughtry's album. It just seems to be a bit shabby.On the other hand, if you listen to the sample tracks, you can tell that is obviously NOT Chris Daughtry. The cover art is a dead giveaway, also."
1,Who is this?,"I bought this CD thinking it was Chris Daughtry but I was wrong,Instead I bought Chris Daugherty who sings Country music and let me tell you something it is one of the worst Cd's I've ever heard I ended up breaking the Cd and throwing it into the River (No Joke!) I would not reccomend this Cd to anyone.And Remember to get the last name right, or you might end up with Chris Daugherty the Country singer!!!"
1,Wrong One,I was looking for Chris Daughtry's CD and I accidently ordered this guy's. My mistske. I'll give it to someone who likes country music.
1,not from american idol,"It is my fault for not checking the spelling, I suppose the ""powers of selling would say"" This is NOT the guy from American Idol. The last name is spelled differently. I have not even listened to this cd. So in fairness to this artist, I really do not know. I think it was sold to me under false pretenses."
3,Fun Cars in revue,"A decent video summary of the Shelby era at its peak. Some interesting information, but, of course, not quite enough depth for the serious gear head. I have never yet found a really satisfying history of deveopment, engineering details, the entire development path for any interesting mechanical toys, be they cars, planes, boats, whatever, presented in a video format, as the producers always play to the lowest common denominator...If you like the cars, it is an ok piece that may add to your knowledge. If you are a mechanic, engineer or a driver, pass to avoid the voids, as it were."
2,Family The ties that bind and gag--Erma bombeck,"I ordered an audio cassette of Irma Bombeck's Family-The Ties That bind..and Gag for my dad for his birthday and what he got was a paperback book which he did not want nor read so it ended up in the trash. This was very upsetting for me as I specifically ordered an audio cassette tape. My dad absolutely loves Erma Bombeck's oldies listening, not paperback books. All I can say is I will definitely watch what I order in the future and double check my order more than once."
5,love it,"Have the whole Hagan set in paperback, now working on getting the whole set on CD. Hope they continue making all the others."
4,Raven on the Wing,"Very light reading for those times when you want a break from the usual hardcore, its fresh with a touch of romance and dont you just love it when a woman can handle a man and give as good as she gets."
3,books,this book is hard to get into. i have read all of kay hoopers books and will continue to do so.
3,ok cd,"If you like old school hip hop, than this would be the ideal cd. Again. ok cd for those hip hop fans."
2,"Not fun for family, limited as a learning tool","This is pretty much kid vs kid only. Adults cannot play along. You can make it into a solo game for one child, but its really more like flash cards for spelling if you do that.The product is basically a set of flash cards for spelling, with some letter cubes for the kids to spell out the words. The rules propose two games, which are basically see if the kids spells the word right, they get to keep the card if they do, first kid with 5 cards wins. Adults can pretend to play along if the child is younger and will ""fall for it."" It really works as a game only if there are two kids the same age playing.I don't know, but I can't see my daughter pulling this out when a friend comes over. Therefore, to the extent this is a set of flash cards for spelling, its kind of expensive for what it is.Don't get me wrong, you can definitely make it into a learning tool. Your call."
5,My daughter's favorite game!!,"We received Boggle Jr as a gift at Christmas. My daughter is almost four and absolutely loves this game. She is learning her words and is learning to spell. This is a wonderful game for learning picture recognition and verbalization and moving on to spelling three and four letter words. I told my sister and she requested it for her son. He's a happy camper with the game, too."
1,BORING!,"My husband & I love to play boggle so we were excited to find boggle jr to share with our kids. We couldn't even finish playing one time. This is not a game. You don't roll the dice or play in any way. This is a ""learning"" activity, but it isn't fun at all. I am very disappointed in this."
2,Educational but boring!!!,"I purchased this game for my 4 yr old, now 5 yrs old and she's still not excited about the game because you continuously have to turn the blocks over to find the correct letter. I think Parker Brothers need to add additional features like a timer or music."
5,Excellent Educational Game,My kids love this game-esp my 5 yr old-She derives such pride out of doing it all by herself-and its nicethat she can sit for a good amount of time and play unassisted:)
5,A great way to teach the alphabet,"My granddaughter has learned all most all of her alphabet thanks to this great game. It makes learning fun and easy and she picks out letters on T-Shirts, store fronts, almost everywhere we go. It is a great way to teach children how to spell and makes it fun so the children don't realize they are learning."
2,Not engaging or particularly fun,"This game was not engaging. My son did not find it interesting. He has not asked to play with it again. You push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself.If you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance, try What's GNU. It is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults."
2,Where is the game?,"What an utterly boring game. We love to play games, including educational games, but Boggle Jr. was a huge dud with my 3 and 5 year old kids. Really, this is just flashcards with letter dice (and the dice don't even get rolled). There's no game or strategy...just letter matching. This one went to Goodwill after a few plays."
1,"Maybe educational, but boring","My son has played this game exactly once - it is just not a fun or interesting game. He just turned four and ran through all the cards the first time he played it. All you do is match the letters on the dice to the letters on the card. I can see where there is some educational value to the game (I am a former teacher) but why bother, when there are so many other more fun ways to learn the same skills. I like the suggestion of the earlier reviewer to just buy a regular Scrabble game to do the same activities."
4,Great Game teaches Sight Words,I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter to help her learn her sight words. It's a fun way fro me to teach her. Another great game for this is Scrabble Junior
4,An honest look at the eventing world.,Two things strike me particularly having read this book: one is how honest Pippa is with herself and her readers and the other is just how challenging (not to mention terrifying) eventing is at the top level. If you are looking for an insider's view of the real world of top level eventing you will find it here.
3,improve eye sight,"Very technical, but has a couple of excerices which are worth doing. But i'm sure there must be better books on the ""how to methods"" of dr Bates."
3,Compact Oven is Indeed Compact,"The oven works fine, but is a bit smaller than I expected. Fortunately, I understand that larger versions are available."
4,"Ronco ST3001SSGEN Showtime Compact Rotisserie and Barbeque Oven, Stainless Steel","Ronco ST3001SSGEN Showtime Compact Rotisserie and Barbeque Oven, Stainless Steel is so far a pretty damn good system!! My better half has made dinner 3 or 4 times and it all was super. I suggest anyone to buy this item 'cause the price is good and the unit is great!!thanks again Amazon and Ronco folk!rbceo/mdi"
3,Full size is better,"We used our old full size Showtime for years and always had excellent results before the glass front broke. For some reason, the new compact unit doesn't cook the meat as tender as the old one did. The stainless steel is harder to keep looking nice than the old white one did. We still use the new one for cooking tritip roasts when the weather is to cold to BBQ."
3,Oven came with pieces broken off,I ordered this oven because I have another Betty Crocker rotisserie that has been awesome for 9 yrs. This oven arrived with a piece broken off of the glass door top. The piece was not even in the box so I believe it was packaged broken. My husband threw away the outer box before we could even return it. I hope it works as good as my old Betty Crocker. So beware of the product being broken before you even get to use it.
2,"Made cheap, not like they used to be.",Bought this Ronco and it is made very cheap and not well made. Not at all like the first one we owned several years ago. Disappointed.
4,Compact Ronco rotisserie,"I currently have a full size ronco rotisserie. The one problem I saw with the advertisement (before the purchase)is that it did not give dimensions or describe the size of the box. I went ahead and ordered it because it was for a single person anyway but it would have been nice to know before hand what the size was (I also assumed that ""compact"" meant it was smaller). As for the machine itself the, it did come with all the attachments that were described on the outside of the box...but when I opened the top of the box it had directions for a completely different model. The packing list and directions in the box were for a Ronco 4000 model. My brother has used the Rotisserie and so far has no problems and is enjoying a new cooking style."
1,Do not trust Discount Jungle,I sent my ronco back to Discount Jungle because of a crack. I have not recieved a replacement or return of deposit.
2,Not correctly advertised,"Advertised as ""set it and forget it,"" but inside it says not to be taken literally. There are too many things in the way of preparation."
2,"Excellent chicken, if you like BBs in your food","First, let me say, this cooker makes the best darned chicken I have ever had. However, the first time I used mine, numerous BBs appeared in the drip tray. Thought it was a fluke but there they were the second time as well. Small metal balls, that could be lead for all I know. I tried calling the 800 number on the back of the oven, only got voicemail, and no return calls. I tried the customer service email and fax that came with the oven - undeliverable. And I have been trying to get response from Ronco ever since. So, great product if you get one that works, but be advised, if you need support, you're pretty much out of luck."
1,Very upset,"This rotsserie is crap, I have used it twice and after washing the metal rods I noticed that the paint on them was flaking off, I examined the product and bits of paint was inside of it, all the docs that came with it show that the drip pan and drainer are stainless not this one they are painted also and flaking, I do not recommend any one buying this kind of unit, mine went to the dumpster, the manufacturer will not stand behind it and the short warranty Amazon gives won't either."
3,Cooks Great Chicken!,"Best chicken ever! Awful painful to use! Messy, a lot of effort to get the chicken on the spit, tie the chicken, in such way it doesn't fall of the spit, while rotating, then getting the cooked chicken off the spit, very messy! Appearance of the machine deteriorates quickly, because of the thin metal it is made of, high heat, with grease that's baked on! Once used, it will show discoloration, no matter what! So I hide it in a closet when not being used!! I am happy with the outcome,(Great Chicken) so I am willing to accept the many shortcomings!"
4,Perfect for small families,"This rotisserie works wonders when you don't want to stand on your feet for long periods of time and always checking on temperatures. It only holds a maximum of a 5-6 lb whole chicken, which is perfect since its just my husband and myself. The rotisserie basket is great for holding chicken breasts and pork tenderloins. Sometimes, the times have to be tweaked to your own cooking preferences, but if you have a digital thermometer it is no problem."
1,Don't Buy,Do not buy this album not only is it a release of old material but Grandaddy's old record company have released it without the bands knowledge. DO NOT BUY this record
5,VERY SPECIAL ALBUM!,"There is plenty to be excited about on this album. The songs are from the early days of Grandaddy and they show how and why this band has become one of the great ones. I really love ""Why Would I Want to Die"". In it's own way it is a top 2 or 3 song of all time for Grandaddy. The album as a whole really made me appreciate the beauty of one of my favorite bands."
1,Sent old issues,Received my first two issues on the same day. One i had already purchased a month earlier and the other was the prior months issue! I wont buy subscriptions from here anymore.
1,Two many pictures of fit men,This is a good magazine for a gay man (or a girl) who wants to look at pictures of attractive men. Every advertisement and every article includes a picture of a buff guy. I prefer Men's Journal for tips and interesting articles.
2,Perfect For Overweight Guys Who Feel Sexually Insecure,"I have recieved this magazine for free going on a year now. Although I do like some of the articles, I find that it seems to be ironically aimed towards the overweight reader who is experiencing sexual problems. The workouts listed always tell a person how to ""slim down"" or ""get rid of that gut"". Personally, I'm 18 and not fat, so it's quite hard to find any workouts geared for me. As to the second part of my argument, I don't see why they feel a need to include sexual topics in the magazine, but if they must, they needn't go as far as they do. Call me old fashioned, but I think that health magazines should be about getting healthy and staying there, not old fat guys who have lost their stamina."
1,Politically biased Sell-Outs!,"I have had a subscription since college to this magazine. When they started salivating over Obama and putting him in the magazine and finally on the cover, it was more than I could handle. I read the magazine for the nutrition and exercise tips and things generally of interest to guys like me. I dont want to hear about politics, especially if it liberally biased. The shameless adoration of Obama crossed the line and does not belong here. That issue went right in the trash along with my subscription. The issue with Obama in it before that had a full length picture of him with captions pinpointing how fabulously he dresses, I mean come on!... that is ridiculous! Bush wore the same suits and I dont recall the same commentary on him, not that I even want to see Bush in there either. I am sure that there are many like me who done want this liberal bias shoved down their throats and will no longer read mens health."
5,My Little Secret,"Whenever I visit my brother, I always steal his copies of Men's Health. I love the humor, wit and sarcasm of the editoral staff-unlike most women's magazine, Men's Health gives you straight-up nutritional advice that doesn't involves starving yourself. The relationship advice is great for women, as it gives us insight into how men think (well, sort of). Overall, for fitness, love, nutrition, mental and physical health, this is a great read for men and women alike."
5,Great magazine,This magazine is great. I love how they talk about men's health and whatnot. Makes me want to be both more healthy and a man.
4,Its the next best thing.,I think this magazine is a bit biased. However it does offer some good workouts and or changes you can make and shake things up in your day workout. Lots of ads for things you don't really need in my opinion. It does offer other god tid bits about food and life. Best bet it to go to a trainer or Specialist in Fitness Nutrition like myself.
1,Not written for the normal male,"I received this magazine for a few years but ended up stopping it after renewal ran out.It's just not made for the ""normal"" 9-5 working male.. sure there are some good articles at times but when they get into fashion the normal man can't afford most of the items unless they make over 100,000 year.The workout articles seem to be the same just names differently, there are a lot of ads also to be aware of..I say if you past a newsstand and see this magazine and something grabs your eye you are better off .."
1,Only somewhat useful but very annoying,"I have twice subscribed to Men's Health and both times was disappointed. You really only ever need two issues of this repetitive journal of contradictory advice and mediocre fitness strategies. Real information is offered up sparingly and is often incomplete. There is however, an abundance of absurd success stories of people who are either so young that they can easily achieve their fitness goals or have so much time that they have no excuse not not be in shape.There is little that applies to anyone over thirty who have actual jobs and need to live real lives.Furthermore, they slip additional book offers and subscriptions in with your contract. You can easily spend 5 to 6 times the subscription price per year if you don't stay on top of the junk that hey send you. Honestly, one of the worst magazines in terms of all the additional crap that they send to you."
1,Men's Health rip off,"If you want to take a look at this magazine get it off the shelf 1st. If you like it, keep buying it that way. Nothing against Amazon, I've always been happy with their service. The problem pops up when you go to renew your magazine subscription. Rodale books, the publisher, has a REAL nasty habit of setting people up for auto renewals and not really telling them. Once you end up on auto renewal good luck trying to get it canceled. What you end up with is a lot of threatening letters from collection agencies and lots of time trying to get a hold of a real person to cancel the subscription."
1,Delievery,You keep sending it to the wrong address and it is present to some else. I am trying to correct this.
3,Over 50 crowd,Not enough info on beginning again later in life. Maybe a new branch off just for us over 50. How about mag and Internet all one price. I bought it on Amazon from my IPad just wish publisher would let me watch the same mag on my mobile device.
4,"Great Mag, Always learn something",I always learn something new and useful from this mag. I read this and the Wall Street Journal.
2,For Exercise Routines not so good,"I do not like this magazine, I have tried to like it but find it to full of junk, lot of ads, to few infomation regarding exercise routines and sometimes I found two very different advise of the same thing in the same issue so I am left confused, go at take a look if you like it get a subscription if you don't buy instead Men's Workout or Exercise for Men Only, more stuff in less pages and more to the point."
2,Mens Health,To much advertisement print is yought to read and subject matter is juvenille I will not be ordering next time
2,"Agreed, one year is all you need.","I subscribed to Men's Health for over two years and recently I've been going through the back issues to cut out some stuff for an art project and I can attest that 'there are only so many ab exercises one can do'. Every month there is a fold out workout plan /poster that focuses on a certain area of the body (abs, shoulders, legs, etc) and looking back it was pretty much the same stuff every month. I guess it would be good for someone that needs a new routine every now and then or a reminder of how to properly stay in form. The stuff in the beginning is usually diet and quick news bits about health, some sex-related Q&A, and well ads throughout. Go to your local market and pick up a copy. Go through it and just imagine every month being basically the same with minor tweaks in the info. There are good articles from time to time however. I would simply read these online if it happens to catch my interest from looking at the cover."
2,Quality has gone down hill,"For several years I was a subscriber, but within the pas couple years it seems the quality has gone down. This magazine is no longer something that I enjoy reading every article of as I did in the past. I still get one or two copies a year, but its content has changed for the worse. Now it seems that its more focused on trends and trying to be hip in a metrosexual sort of way."
2,Men's Health Magazine through Lightning deal,"Pretty tricky.I order 1 year Subscription. It is noted that it will be 4 - 6 weeks before I get my first copy, no problem with that.But when I get my first copy, Mid June, it's the Issue for March. So I am started off with a 2 month old issue. Why would anyone want or expect back orders as part of a New Subscription? I am expecting, mid June, to get July's issue.I find this a little crooked and crummy.If that is part of my 12 issues, I certainly will not reorder and will be more cautious of Subscriptions through Amazon's lightning deals.That is what my Rating is based on."
2,Rodale Customer Service is Pathetic,"Be warned! I'm only a casual reader of Men's Health, but I recently contacted their costumer support via e-mail to inquire about a back issue. I have been given cookie-cutter automated responses to every e-mail interaction (going on four e-mails from me now). Even after instructing them to reference my original e-mail and actually read what I was asking...they gave me an automated response.I would hate to see what happens if someone had a problem with their actual subscription..."
1,Men's Health sensational titles misleading,"My wife gave me this as a Christmas present. The mag looked interesting and appeared to have some good articles. But, when I began to look inside and read these articles I found that they were a very shallow representation of the title on the cover. I found these tiles on the cover to be a gross misleading description of the contents. I am now in the process of cancelling my subscription. It is insanely difficult to find a link that will allow you to cancel. I won't be ordering any more magazines from Amazon. Too difficult to communicate. We asked for some communication about this account to verify the cancellation and have yet to receive any."
1,don't be looking here to get healthy...,Unless being healthy is defined as the most updated clothes and fragrances...Magazine has gone downhill over time to included less and less on working out and eating healthy. For some reason this and other magazines find they need to move into the fashion segment. They should leave that for GQ and focus on their core competencies.
2,This is a womans version of Maxum,"I can not imagine a straight guy wanting this magazine. Is has some decent health tips but seriously, why does a man want to see ripped guys in marble sacks. They were going directly into the trash half way through the year (after the wife got a look at them)."
1,Bad business,Thanks for letting me know that Men's Health is half price a day after I ordered it for the regular price. How do you stay in business??? It will be the last time for any order from me.
2,Was a Good Magazine in the Past,"In the mid-90's, Men's Health was a fantastic magazine. For the past few years, it has been nothing but a mouthpiece for nationalized healthcare, taxation on ""sinful"" foods, and other bad ideas designed to limit personal freedoms. It still has a few good tips from time-to-time, but you have to be willing to overlook a lot of nonsense to find them."
2,Back issues,"I enjoy the magazine, however, When I purchased it on Amazon, they said it would start in 6 weeks. Instead, Men's Health sent me back issues of Setember and October. I already have them. This is an issue that should be looked at. If you purchase an item to start at a certain time, it should'nt be allowed to send back issues."
1,Men's Health,"I can't write a review as the first issue has not been delivered. I was told originally it would be sent on Mid October, Now I have been advised it will be arriving mid November. I can't understand the poor delivery time. I ordered this in August.Thank you."
2,eh--it was ok.,I gave this subscription to my husband as a gift while he was in law school so he would have something else to read besides law books. He likes to exercise and keep fit but he was not overly impressed with this magazine. He like the first few magazines that came but the one's after that seemed to feature the same type of stories and had a lot of advertisments for things. We did not re-order.
2,"Weak, but it does have Joe Quenan","Not a great magazine. They do now have Joe Quenan after the mororn who runs GQ now fired him. Workout articles can be found for free on the Menshealth website or other forums. Fashion is ok, realisticly priced (at least for me:). Maybe most importantly, it's NOT a sexist and misogynistic magazine such as FHM, Details, etc. They have some mindless fiction each month, also. I just wish someone could put it all together: fashion, fitness, current events."
2,Polished . . but absurd,"I've been a subscriber almost since the inception. It's a high quality, slick, polished magazine, but I've finally had enough of the ridiculous content. The Nov. 2010 issue was the final eye opener. Examples . . . Page 80 is trying to tell us that wearing an OUTERWEAR VEST over a suit is a positive fashion statement. Then, at the bottom of the same page, they recommend a SCARF with an $870.00 price tag. This reminds me of an old Groucho Marx quote. "" Any club that would have me as a member, I don't want to belong to."" Well . . . any magazine that promotes the above, plus many more absurdities, I choose not to follow. I'll find something else. Maybe Men's Journal ?"
1,Beware,"Beware of auto-renewals after you cancel your subscription. They will send you books from Rodale that require you to either pay and keep it or return to sender at your own expense. Contacting the company by phone is next to impossible. The ""contact us"" page says to write to them... yes, write to them. Shady and not worth the hassle. Look elsewhere."
1,don't order if you are planning on changing your address,Submitted a change of address weeks ago. Still have not received an issue. I should have just let the subscription go and re-subscribed from scratch with the new address. What a waste.
2,You can get it cheaper on Menshealth.com website,If you ARE convinced that you want to subscribe to Men's Health (for the light and casual read that it is) dont bother buying it on Amazon. The magazine website has the one-year subscription for $5 less.
3,Decent,"I bought this for my fiance because he used to get the magazine a few years ago. It's a decent magazine for someone that has never had a subscription to it before. However, if you have had a subscription in the past, don't get it again. Why? Because it's the same thing, over and over again. Same articles, same tips, nothing different. Either save your money, or put your money towards a different fitness magazine.IF you have never had a subscription to this magazine before, it's worth it to get it for a year. It's very informative about some things."
4,I'm a woman and I order this for me!,"Over a decade ago, I dated a guy who subscribed to this magazine. I got hooked! The writing is SO funny, and it's chock full of great information for health and fitness.It's kind of like ""The Man Show"" on paper...Now I'm a personal fitness trainer, and often refer back to the various issues for new or different ideas. There are good ideas for mixing up your workout, for eating nutritionally, and motivation.Check it out...Amazon often has killer deals on this subscription. I know there is a version of ""Women's Health"", too, but it's a little watered down for me. But a word of warning: Wear your thick skin if you're a female reading this--don't be easily offended or worked up by all of the humor :) It's not written for us, but to appeal to the testosterone-driven funny bone. ;)"
2,Great magazine.,"I love the magazine but the customer service sucks. I ordered the magazine in April 2010; knowing that I would not receive my first edition for 6-8 weeks. So I purchased the May, June, and July edition at the news stand. I received the May issue on June 30 and the June issue on July 7, 2010. I called customer service explaining that I already purchased the May, June, and July issues. They told me that they would only extend my subscription for one month (until May 2011). I thought this was very poor of them. I am getting really tired of talking to someone overseas."
2,"Did you see the one about arms, abs and sex?","I had a subscription for a year (10 issues). The truth be told, you could have a 10 year subscription and only get one issue every time.Let's face it, every issue talks about blasting your biceps/arms/guns, melting/eliminating/flattening your ""gut"" and having amazing/mind blowing/explosive sex (there, I just reviewed three issues). Add whichever dude is currently in some action flick or divorcing Demi Moore on the cover and bam, you have a new issue.Unless you are always low on toilet paper, pass on the subscription and just pick up a single issue."
1,Men's Health Stealth,"MH has some good content on a variety of topics, although I would like more on fitness and health. Their treatment of customers is another story. I dislike the fact that they regard a subscription as permanent until you figure out how to turn it off. Just now I spent $7.50 returning books I didn't want. They sent me a notice beforehand allowing me to opt out, but I was away on vacation. When I returned, I sent in the opt out form, but apparently it was too late and I received the book for a 21 day trial. I was ready to return them immediately, but the fine print says that an invoice is to be included; in another place it says the invoice will arrive in a few days. After at least 15 days (of the 21 day period), the invoice hasn't arrived. After I found a phone no. and called it at 10am on a Monday morning, the recorded message said it couldn't take the call - try again another time. Rodale has sneaky ways of serving its custormers."
2,A guide for WASPs,"I ended my subscription with Men's Health (MH) last month with difficulty. They required you to write in a letter stating you resign your subscription, even though I paid by check..??!! The articles are now mediocre and every issue seems more and more concerned with getting women in bed than focusing on health. Who cares that Prada has a new line of casual slip-ons? Not me. I'm not interested in Cartier wristwatches, either."
2,Too repetitive,"The first issue is great. The second issue to helpful. By the end of the year of your subscription, you're tired of learning of another 276 esoteric fruits and vegetables that scientists in other countries say lower some cancer risk by x%. And you don't need yet another workout routine designed by a movie star or athlete. My advice is read a few pages next time you're waiting for a haircut. That's all you really need."
2,Not what is used to be...,"When it first came out, Men's Health was a health magazine. Now it is a mildly amusing waste of paper. There is rarely anything new or revolutionary in it. They keep rehashing the same ""health"" news, and keep adding more and more articles about sex. The humor is nice, but not enough to make up for a lack of real health articles."
2,"Mostly fluff for metro-sexuals, gays, and women","I've subscribed for several years and have finally asked my wife to stop renewing for me (for Xmas). I can't figure out what the magazine wants to be: a metrosexual guide, a fitness guide, a health & beauty guide,....Its not a fitness mag., because the fitness articles are lame and sparse. You could read Ladies Home Journal and get the same.The men's health and beauty feature articles about ""looking thin"", and then present guys wearing $1000+ outfits. Sorry, dudes -- I don't know who your audience is, but its not me.Finally, the advice columns are often a joke...like Jimmy the Bartender taking 5 paragraphs to finally say, ""Don't sleep with your girlfriends sister."" Yea...who'd a thunk that one!"
3,Sappy '60s Brazilian ballads,"Slow-paced ballads from a crooner who was best known for his work on the film ""Black Orpheus."" This disc includes his versions of ""A Felicidade"", and ""Manha De Carnaval,"" which were originally from the film. For the most part, this collection is full of slower, super-syrupy romantic material, Brazilian boleros, practically... It's okay, but probably not for everyone; similar in tone to Jair Rodrigues's schmaltzier material."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Not having heard of the band before, I was very impressed with ""Easter Song"" which came on a chill-out compilation album. Then I heard another track by the band on another album and thought that I would go to the source, so to speak. I suppose that my expectations were a bit out of line based on only two tracks but ""Duende"" was not quite what I expected. I thought that it was going to contain more lushly produced tracks but even the ""Easter Song"" on this album is very much stripped down compared to the version I have elsewhere, which to me is a pity but may please others. I just provide this caveat to others who may be coming to this album from a similar experience to my own."
4,Sparkling!! Beautiful!!!,The earrings are very bright and sparkly. Lots of light play throughout the stones. The pair I received are not cloudy at all. I fooled my ignorant husband into thinking they are CZ (He likes that price better). These earrings could easily cost twice as much.As stated in other reviews; the backs are not tight enough. I would have scored these 5 stars except for that fact.
1,"One big, one small",Returned the earrings because one was small and one was large -- not even close to the same size.
1,Earrings,They look worse than a cheap fake pair of earrings. I wouldn't take them for free much less pay 400+ for them. Those are the first & last pair of diamond earrings I buy from here.
2,A Great Buy- For 3 Months,"For the first three months of use with this straightener, I was thrilled with the results. My frizzy, thick, dry, curly locks had been transformed into sleek, shiny strands. It was great! About 3 months into using it however, it stopped heating. I had done nothing to the appliance, so I figured it was just a defect and sent it in to Helen of Troy (the company that produces it) for a replacement. 1 1/2 months later, I receive my replacement. Things are going good until yesterday, it stopped heating again! Something is definately wrong with the way these straighteners are produced. I would recommend getting an HAI instead. My friend has had her's for over 18 months and has had no trouble whatsoever. Remember- always go with ceramic for less damage to your hair, and make sure that the straightener produces at least 170 watts of power. Happy shopping!"
4,A helpful book for your shelf.,"A medical librarian gave me a copy of this title when I had a baby. I appreciated the simple decision points and advise, from ""Call the Doctor Now"" to ""Apply home remedy."" With a family member with a baby on the way I thought a the revised edition was just the thing for that household."
1,Very low quality,"I was looking for a small pen, because I have the habit to keep always a pen in my pockets.In couple of weeks the black cover of this nicely looking pen started eroding in multiple places, showing the metal below. Now it looks extremely ugly."
2,Piece of Junk but does the job (for now),Complete piece of junk - fell apart immediately and we had to glue it back together. Works (for now) but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
5,Electric Key Lock Switch,For those that don't have a RF key pad to open their garage door opener this is a great substitute that uses a key. Easy to install and works well.
2,Nice Pictures Not Much Substance,"Lacks an overview map showing the routes in relation to the state. Even with the poor Colorado map towards the front it's difficult to locate the routes. Dangerously out of date. For example, Rollins pass is impassible and has been so for years since the collapse of the Needle's Eye Tunnel. It's a nice drive nonetheless, but you're coming up from the west to the tunnel or the east to the tunnel and you're not making over the top from either direction. I don't mean challenging or not recommended, but literally impassible. The book leads you to believe you can get from Nederland to Winter Park, but that's wasn't going to happen even when this book was last printed. Can't vouch for all the other roads, but confirm before attempting them."
3,mislead,"The book I received does give me the information I was looking for. However, the listing was for a hardback, and the one I received is paperback. These things do happen once in a while."
1,too vague,"Would definately have preferred more specifics about each trip. The pictures were beautiful, however and aided in my decision on which trip to start with. (have chosen the Flat Tops, slated for next August.) I think the idea for this book was great, but would have preferred additional information. Lists are always good. What to bring, when to go, how long to stay. Some of the trips included this info, but not all of them. For those of us amateurs unskilled in the art of backroading, this would be useful information to have."
4,Good book for an introduction to the breed...,"This book has plenty of nice photos, and basic information on the breed.Out of 192 pages, only the first 64 are Shiba-specific. The rest is miscellaneous dog info. It covers things like the breed standard, a brief history of the breed, etc.I would not reccomend it to someone who already knows a decent amount about the breed and wants to further their Shiba knowledge. But it is good for someone new to the breed just looking to learn the basics, breed standard, similar breeds, etc."
3,Good dog book but not a real good Shiba book,"I'm not too impressed so far by Tomita's book, Shibas. I'm 3/4 of the way through and don't recall reading the word Shiba since I read the title. All the info is presented as ""dog"" information, not Shiba specific. It's good info but I wouldn't reguard the book as a great reference guide on Shibas. This may be unfair, since I haven't finished but in the meantime I wanted to prevent people from possibly being decieved about the books content based on the title."
2,Going down hill,"I used to really like this magazine, but it seems to be going down hill very rapidly now. It is about half the size it used to be, and contains way too much advertising. I suspect that the reason is that Stephen J. Gould's column is what made the magazine so popular, until he quit writing it before he died. I will definitely be letting my subscription expire."
2,A Graduate Student's Best Friend,Endnote X was made typing research paper an enjoyable task. It is user friendly with its keyboard shortcuts and technical support assistance. This was the first time I have used citation software and Endnote X made it easy for me to concentrate on the art of writing instead of shuffling through the APA manual to accurately cite a reference. IT IS DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANY STUDENT!
2,Not Compatiblt with Office 2008,"This is not compatible with office 2008. Tech support just says use an earlier version of office, a pretty expensive solution if you don't own an earlier version of office. Refman by same company so beware."
5,Endnotes is a must-have for literature reviews!,"Working on my doctoral dissertation, Endnotes has been invaluable resource. It organizes, cross-references, downloads from databases, catalogues, saves a copy of my files in one place, and so much more. I don't know how I ever survived without it!"
3,Complicated,"I bought this to keep track of references when writing papers in APA format for my graduate courses. But, I found it complicated to use. I recommend Reference Points software instead--- much easier to use and cheaper too, with brief online demo."
2,More trouble than it's worth,I should have known better. It is easier to learn and remember the various systems used for footnoting and bibliographies than it is to get this product to work properly. You'll spend more time tweaking the program than you would just writing the things out yourself!
2,didnt fit,didnt fit my pet rat and one of them is pretty big they just slip out of it so completely pointless and not what i thought it was
4,well made,"Very well made. I would like it a size smaller for my purpose though. I wanted it for my chipmunk, but he is too small for it and slipped right out. Other than size I believe it well made and well designed"
3,Too small for anything...,"This item is too small for anything except a chipmonk, squirrel or ferret. I assumed for some reason it would fit my Yorkie, however the company or person did reimburse me for the price of the item rather than ship it back to them minus the shipping costs i paid for. So all in all it was not adequately described as to what pets it is useful for."
4,Skating around old New York,"""Who wanted to walk through lonely years, right foot, left foot, and never change step---never skip, run or skate?""That's Lucinda, an Anne-of-Green-Gables girl, filled with energy and enthusiasm, unexpectedly set loose in the city of New York. Lucinda's parents head off to Europe for their health and Lucinda is left in the care of two very relaxed school teachers. She travels around New York City, befriending the poor and the lonely, on roller skates.What a surprise to see a girl of the 1890's, a society girl raised with all the Victorian rules and regulations stamped upon her, free to make friends with homeless men and battered wives of new immigrants and fruit sellers!I liked this book a lot. I wonder if Lucinda is able to keep her friends and her freedom once her parents have returned and regained control."
5,"Excellent, Fun Book","This book is a charming book about a charming child and her adventures over a year. There is a serious and sad side to the book as well, as there is to any life, but overall the story is wonderful."
3,"Boring, not exciting","Roller Skates is very boring. I didn't have any interest in it at all. I didn't really want to finish the book, but I had to. I wouldn't suggest this book for kids, but adults might enjoy it more. If you have to read this book, like me, then try to make it more interesting. It takes place in the 1800's, so I think that could be part of the problem. Don't get this book if you're under 13."
2,Give me the original,"This was purchased for our grandson. He is very good at this type of game but was totally frustrated by the set up. We thought ""electronic"" met it relied more on computer skills but it only made things more difficult."
4,Love it,"The only thing that I can complain about is that you can't understand the computer when it says ""confirm hit or confirm miss"" hit & miss sound the same. So if you are playing against the computer in the advanced mission it is almost a waste of time, but against another player, it's the best."
3,Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission,"Battleship is a classic game I played as a child. We thought we would try the electronic version--but at around $80.00, I think I enjoyed the old fashioned game better. I also found it for about half that amount after this purchase."
3,OK,"My daughter didn't really care much for this game. Little difficult to use, and the preprogrammed games are not that easy to program."
1,This Game ...! Stick with Classic version ...,"I have to agree with the guy who said that there is very little ""electronic"" about this game. For the money, I was actually expecting the game to sense where your ships are, etc. This is nothing more than the classic game played by enetering your ship coordinates and missles fired into a mechanism that keeps track and makes a few noises when one is hit. Not easy for the little ones to play. HASBRO YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED PUSHING THIS ...!"
2,"Well, very difficult to set up","I bought this for my little brother for Christmas, it looked great, and I thought he'd love it. It didn't quite beat a Nintendo 64 from my parents, but I helped him set it up. It was soooo hard to program and start, we still haven't figured it out ---- even with the instructions. It takes too long and too difficult to set up, otherwise it seems to work fairly well."
4,Cool features but...,"This battleship is nice because of the new electronic features, but the sound is a little hard to understand, and it is very hard to read the letters and numbers because they are the same color as the screen with no back lighting, if they were a differant color or lite up the game would be easier."
4,Great Game,My kids are 9 and 10 and both love this game. With different play options it will see alot of play for years. Enjoyable for kids and parents.
5,FUN for FAmily,"I have always wanted this game!! But I got an oven instead, now I have a husband and two boys, and it's the BOMB!! My boys are 7, and 9.. and they love to play. My husband and I are in our mid-thirties,and we love to play!!"
5,Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission: Awesome,"I purchased the Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission for my 7 year old grandson for Christmas. The game is so much fun. During the Christmas holidays we played about 5 times. He is enjoying it very much. Quite impressed with the durability and substantiality of this product - along with how the game opens and closes and how the game can be played in a flat position or raised position. The voice and sounds are incredible.....though quite loud. I wish there was a volume control. We tried to play Electronic Battleship in the TV room, but it disturbed others who were trying to listen to the TV. Again, great game and I can hardly wait to visit my grandson in Georgia and play it again with him."
2,software issues,"The game is relatively easy to use and of reasonable quality the software is faulty on multiple different occasions the software records incorrect hits, or ships and assorted other software failures."
5,Very exciting to play!,"At first, I hesitated purchasing the electronic edition of Battleship which cost $40 over the traditional one for $15. I am so glad I purchased it! I have 4 children, 3 of which are old enough to play and understand the game. They play for hours, with each winner playing the next person!Definitely worth the money, and a great gift if you can put aside the actual battling aspect of the game!"
2,great toy for convicts,"I would have bought this toy for a convict. Otherwise, its worthless. My children found it borish, lame and no fun at all. I thought it was pointless. I would advise anyone with a few dollars to save their money."
5,cool game,"This is a cool game, what is really nice is it can be played by one player as well as two. My 5 year old son really enjoys playing the classic mode. This was a Christmas present from my wife and although it says for 8 and over it is pretty easy for a younger child to pick up on. We have yet to play any advanced missions but I am looking forward to it. Overall very entertaining."
4,ships,"This was a fun game I played as a child, and my husband and I played together on New Year's eve."
3,Regular game with sound affects,"The sound affects are good at first, but they slow the the play of the game. I expected the game to be more automated. It is just the regular game with sound affects."
2,Disappointed,I am a big fan of classic battleship (non-electronic) but this one was kinda confusing and too complicated. I was frustrated with the computer constantly telling me i was making errors I could never enjoy the game. I had to return this product..I think they made it too complicated.
5,An Even Better Version Of ANTHOLOGIA,"Asia's GOLD is an even better version of their ANTHOLOGIA double-CD set; both include the entirety of the recordings they made for Geffen between 1982 and 1990. This one improves the sound quality immensely and corrects some errors in the original version. Therefore, even if you own ANTHOLOGIA, you should buy this set, especially since the belief among the members of the original line-up- now back together- that Indonesia's 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist was trumped-up and unjust makes this collection an essential purchase for your conscience as well as your ears, even if the original album covers aren't in the booklet for this one."
4,Makes good sense,This book was written clearly for the layman (as opposed to doctors or nutritionists) and the recommendations on the diet make sense though they tend towards vegetarianism which meat lovers might not want to cope with. The recipes that I've tried are good.
1,20 grams of fat per day is too little.,"Cutting total fat intake to 20 grams a day is a drastic, unrealistic and probably unwise recommendation for most people. 20 grams of fat yields 180 kcalories -that means less than 10% of the daily caloric intake is fat. If the authors are really advocating this, then their prescribed diet could be potentially unhealthy."
4,Great book,"This book is great! It explains in laymans terms the whys and hows of the diet. The only negative is the food chart in the back is outdated. I would love to see it updated. Beyond that, the diet itself works and the book explains the simple changes to make in your life to adapt to a healthier, fiber filled life style."
3,OKAY DIET PLAN,"This is similar to WW's Fat&Fiber plan, but more restrictive. It should work well though."
3,Disapointed,"The book seemed out of date as it was published some years ago. It also used a program that was not current on the recipient's computer. As for books offered that give instructions, it would be good to have the publishing date as well as the program needed to follow the instructions in the offering. I found no fault with the seller's response as it was shipped quickly. We are trying to find a friend to give it to with the program as required in the book to follow the instructions or will donate it to the local library."
4,I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love it it is a great way to save money too it is exactly like the normal game exept it is a mini one and it is easyer to work with i recomend this to anyone that has children andalso for anyone that travels alot but i think that yoou may want to put in a bag just in case any cards fall out or go missing
4,Guess who? fun on the run game,The game is great! only down side is that the little carboard edges tend to bend w use. Other than that we loved playing this on our last raod trip!
3,Guess who!,Love the games however the toy was small I did not realize that it was they small. I was looking for the larger set but it was a gift so I gave it anyways.
3,"Fun for travel, but it doesn't hold the cards well","The cards and the people in the guess who are all paper, would have liked to maybe seen plastic cards in the windows, and they tend to jump out of their slots when used. The person you are trying to have guessed is hard to keep in the slot as there is not even a friction fit to it, falls out on a road trip and you could be searching or just plain lost of it. Finally there is no place to keep the other cards (the people to guess) in either of the units, so carry it all in a ziploc or you will loose pieces."
4,Fun,"Works pretty well. Several of the pictures have scratches from sliding, but is portable and easy to use. Give it a try."
3,Oscillates between too little and too much information,"The most positive aspect of this book is that is also available as an ebook on its accompanying CD. It is certainly a starter book on Office XP, and there is probably not enough in each section to develop a depth of expertise. The section on VBA for instance is fairly general. However, if you are trying to come to terms with Office as a whole for the first time this is a worthwhile book compared with many others of similar size.However, let me add one caveat. There is a companion volume 'XP Inside Out' which covers a lot of the ground covered in this book. I would recommend buying that volume first and then decide if you need Office XP Inside Out or one of the application specific Inside Out books."
3,Enraged by the Companion CD,"The book is quite good, but I would prefer more on VBA and Excel.I am enraged by trying to use the CD. I am trying to read the section,"" MSN MoneyCentral Stock Quotes Add-in. ""About 1/5 of the screen width is taken by hotlinks to things that are not relevant to the subject. The line length of the text exceeds the 4/5 of the screen width so it is required to do a horizontal scroll for each line to read it. NOT GOOD.Even a printout of the screen is truncated... It is possible to get a readable version by select/copy/ paste to wordpad...But I would think that Microsoft could produce a more user friendly CD.Sincerely, Leo"
4,Smokin',"Excellent album. Much better than I had anticipated from the dinosaurs of rock. However, when I saw the show in Providence ""Comfortably Numb"" was sung much better. Some blonde girl I'd never heard of did it. The British Rock Symphony should get her back. Otherwise, the album is great."
3,Roger Daltrey Is Here,"It is hard to find covers like Kashmir with Ann Wilson and Roger Daltrey, this CD begins with a circa 8 min long version with outstanding orchestration and Daltrey efforts to reach the notes, but his voice even now likes me more than Robert Plant's...well, that's the reason i don't like Led Zep but the covers indeed."
1,Good music - if it's sung ON PITCH.,"The band and orchestra sound fine, but get some singers with a clue next time! Or maybe just Mike Brecker on saxophone - now HE'S a musician!"
2,How about the same thing with American classic rock tunes?,"The concept is cool, but I would rather hear symphonic recordings of American rock standards of the 70's. The British invasion is over, thanks. Besides, where are the Kinks? And Queen?!"
1,A simple book for simple students.,"This was the assigned text for my first semester of college chemistry. During that one semester, I forced myself to read it without compromise, repulsive though it was.In general, it seems that the author attempts to make up for their poor writing ability by using small examples of limited applicability to convey general ideas. This method should work well enough to prepare the reader for the relatively easy exercises that they will find at the end of each chapter, but it ultimately fails to prepare them for real-world problems.Now I have heard that some students prefer examples to words, in which case they should look at this book. Yet for those of us who hope to fully understand the material after the exams are over, a more advanced book is necessary."
2,This Book Is Not For The Beginner,"I don't recommend this book for those who have no background in Chemistry at all. The difinetion aren't clear (sometimes they're very confusing); some of the examples are too short and don't explain well. It's difficult to follow for the biginner. The CD that comes with is almost useless. The test as well as the example questions are almost the same (only the # that are different) There're also some answer mistakes. However, if you just want to review what you've already know, this is not a bad book to have!"
3,dissapointed,This book was damaged because it was shipped in an unprotected manner. It also took over a week to arrive.
3,Not the best...but well worth the price.,"The hoodie is a little flimsy and there's really nothing special about either of these things. However, for the $20 or whatever it was on sale, it was *well* worth the price."
4,Narrow in the toe area,"These shoes are cute for hopping around some place you want to wear heels at, but don't want to wear anything too nice or expensive because you might destroy them (barhopping on a rainy day, for instance).They're a little narrow along the toe area. If you have narrow feet, these would be great for you."
4,it is educational and challenging!,"i like the way it is challenging, because i am always willing to take a challenge. when youve played this game about 8 times, youre a pro, and my grades improoved on vocabulary,spelling,and social studies."
3,Not the greatest packaging,"I'm guessing you didn't come here for a review of the game Scrabble itself, unless you've been living on another planet for the last century. Scrabble is great, always one of my favorites, and a highly recommended game for literally everyone. With that said, this is the version you'll buy if you just want a cheap, simple, low budget type to give to your kids or to give as a gift or award for something. There's nothing terrible about it, but there's nothing great there either. The board is flimsy, the tiles don't always match each other, and the material is simply cheap. It will get the job done just fine, but you're getting what you pay for here."
5,Scrabble,"My grandmother taught me the alphabet with Scrabble tiles when I was 4 or 5 and my love of the game started there. She and I have continued to play for the last 36 years!We didn't always play the traditional cut throat way, we played for combined score, which makes it a ""friendly game"". Read about it on the inside of the box top.I encourage you to add Scrabble to your favorites list."
3,Family FUN?!?!?,"Many people are repelled from this game merely because it is a word game. They think to themselves 'my children won't play this, it looks boring to ME!"" When in fact, this game is addictive. You may go into the game despising it, but when you come out, you'll want to play again and again, striving to beat your opponents, and bust out zebra on a triple word score."
5,Endless hours of entertainment!,"NORmallY i Would FiND thIS kind oF eDUcaTIOnal GamE A bore...BUt beLIEVe me, haVIng bEEn in SChooL ALL Day (i'm A gRAdUAte STudeNT iN CoMPUteR SCIEnces, ANd am OnLY 27 YEarS Old), I lovE THESe enDLEss HOurs Of EntERtainMENT ThaT scraBBLE offERs!!! THIs gaME WIll maKE you LOse YOur MInD, (...) buY THis gaME - the GAME WIll stay AS freSH AS the limITs of youR cREAtivITY! :O)"
3,Good set,"Scrabble is a very popular game and there is very little that I can add as review on the game. However, this scrabble set is very nice. Would make an excellent gift set.I would have liked :1. More number of alphabet pieces.2. The letters are on one side of the piece, they could have been punched on both side of the pieces.3. A scoreboard to maintain the player scores."
3,It gets dull very quickly!!,"I liked this game at first, but then it became very very boring! It is fun to try and put all the letters together to form words but after about 15 minutes I stopped scoring and started wandering off. Everyone I have shared this game with got distracted after the first 10-15 minutes. It is an okay game but if I have a choice in what game I play or reccomend, I'd rather play solitare or something more stimulating and interesting."
5,An evergreen pastime!,"I must have played it a 100 times. But still the charm holds. And no one I know has been able to resist the call of Scrabble. Once the board is opened and the tiles set, even the most indifferent are drawn to it. Its one game that one can never tire of, and every time the game takes a different twist, poses a different challenge. And to think that its educational too! I guess that its the only 'educational' toy that is FUNtastic :) ! My only suggestion would be to include a reuseable scoreboard with the set - it saves the time for hunting for that elusive paper and pen in the midst of a highy tense battle!"
5,It is the most fun game I have ever played!!!,"It is a fun, interesting, and educational game. First the fun part. You can laugh with your friends as you try to spell the largest word you possibly can. It is also educational for children because they learn how to spell better and learn new, excellent vocabulary. This game is highly recommended for kids and adults."
5,scrabble,"another classic, just simply love it. WE have game night and this is the game that the kids usually pick. Mind enrichment."
4,Wonderful Game!,"This is a great mind stimulating game! Everything was packaged nice and the box it came in keeps everything in check. The only complaints I have are:1)The board is not made all that well It is cheap and cut more than once. This is enables them to fold it like a square and fit it into a smaller box. The cuts make it hard to lay the board flat and keep pieces on the board correctly.2)Also the wooden tiles/pieces are very light, I am not sure what type of wood they are.Other than the above, this is a great game to play and have in the house!"
4,Sometimes low-tech is best.,I've played Scrabble for at least 35 years. The Scrabble set I now have is identical to the one I started on 'way back then. No need for fancy electronics with this game.It's a great game for pre-teens and up. Sharpens spelling and other word-language skills. Every home should have a Scrabble board!
5,Scrabble rocks,"There's no reason not to attempt to get your children addicted to Scrabble as soon as possible. As dominating in competition is really the core of capitalism, getting your kids into the strategy of Scrabble by age 12 will have them on the fast track to Libertarian success in no time! Game on!"
5,great classic Scrabble,"I had been searching for the basic Scrabble game and here it is! Wooden racks and letter tiles. Classic design board. The letters come in a black velvet bag, so that you don't have to dump them all out to draw...you just mix them in the bag and draw from it."
4,"Good standard fun, but...","This is a standard Scrabble set- relatively large, durable, and easy enough to use- great as the primary scrabble board for the home. It get's 4 stars for being a good value product.BUT the problem with this new edition is that it no longer comes with a scorecard- pretty annoying! HOWEVER, I have found a solution which is waaay better than even the original scorecard. It's an iPhone/iPod/iPad app that very simply records and auto-calculates all the players' scores as well as top individual word score etc. Get it here:[...]Note: The game of Scrabble itself is of course a 5-star classic- if you've never played it before, try it!"
5,Its scrabble.,Bought as a gag gift for a friend that plays words with friends. I ordered it after we played a game off our smart phones (he was cheating) so decided to get him the real game to play in front of one another. They had no idea i had it sent to their house and it arrived right on april 1st for april fools day! couldn't have been more perfect!
4,Great game!,This game is a lot of fun and is very educational. It increases your word power and vocabulary and is very versatile.
3,Overrated anime/manga? 3 and a half stars.,"I thought this book was okay. Not actually for any of that hocus-pocus stuff, but for the developing romance between Ai and some of the other buxom females. It's kind of lame though, a formula repeated throughout a lot of the anime world. A cute guy has a chance to hook up with all these cute girls, and is really confused on who to choose. Unrealistic ethics in my view.The bishounen art direction is nice, but the fact every female in this manga has gigantic breasts is also a questionable ethic.Magic duels in this book are kind of a Harry Potter thing. I can't say I was really interested in the acion scenes though. The standard flashy anime background got kind of lame in this book. I can understand male appeal, but the shower scenes very so often were inappropriate.IN short, the book was mildly entertaining, humor was kind of low, but the developing romance was very entertaining.I'd have written a more insightful review, but my computer is on the fritz."
2,If you like hot desert with a strong hint of Vanilla... you will love this.,Personally I don't like this tea as it is odd having liquidity unsweetened vanila-esque flavour strong aftertaste. Even when sweetened it is odd- the aftertaste is nausiating . I do enjoy Ahmad English and Earl Grey.
3,Poor design weakens the photos,"This book is a great idea. Steven Barker went into the sex clubs of NYC and documented what happens there. Using only avalible light, the long shutter speeds transform human figures into shadow creatures and smoke shapes. Grainy, impressionistic photos are hobbled by a heavy handed design layout. It seems that some pictures were picked not on their strength but on the ability to fill empty space. I waited a long time for this book to come out and was disappointed with the product. I wouldn't buy this if I was able to flip through it beforehand. It's too bad because what intriqued me about this book was the subject matter and the mysterious world therein. What I got was overdone, dilluted, and, dull."
2,great idea; disappointing execution,"I was drawn to this book by its bold concept, and was pleased to see a beautifully produced book. Unfortunately, the potential of available light photography is stretched here beyond breaking point. The images are mostly nondescript blurs that could have been shot almost anywhere--except for the fleeting hints of naked men. I guess this book is sort of a Rorschach test. Apparently, some see genius in the writhing light and shadow. I see underwhelming photos in attractive packaging."
2,"Dark, darker, darkest","Sorry, hate to differ with the other reviewers but you have to really like barely visible images on black pages to appreciate this work. I don't. Dreamy? Perhaps. Or is just the latest gimmick to be differen? The book itself is handsome but the almost invisible characters inside are doing something but I can't quite make out what it is. I give it an ""A"" for presentation and an ""F"" for photographic content."
2,Interesting but not worth owning,"There is not much to say about this book: a series of murky images of naked men printed on high quality black stock paper.I am sure that this made for an interesting opening at an art gallery but without more explanation about the artist or a more comprehensive artist's statement, much of the impact is lost."
4,Something to grow into,"Passing by the art section in good bookstores I kept noting people paging through a dark black book about night and swimming or something like that. It stayed in my mind's eye. After reading ""Nighswimmer"" by Joseph Olshan and still a bit under its spell I finally picked up this art photography book. Now I've spent time inside the place the book creates and find it wholly mesmerizing. Yes, the images are tough to discern.....like looking for faces in the fog much the way lust feels after midnight. But it is the spontaneity of the moments and the sensitivity of the layout of the book that create a shoreline of approaching and receding waves: this is the way longing feels and looks. Though spare, the commentary is as terse as nervous whispers and adds greatly to the overall effect of this journey. Can't see much here? Then as in all good art, infuse your imagination and go where it feels either best or most dangerous. I like this book."
1,"Did they spend over $1,000 creating this movie?","Agreed! This movie is awful. Tony Curtis is awful (even though he's become famous as an actor and has even been nominated for an academy award (for another movie), he really isn't much more than a high school play grade actor) along with 99% of the other performers in this dog. The made up story/facts... also awful. If you do watch it, you won't be able to believe how cornball the gun battles are, especially the one in the amusement park. As a work of art, this is 180 degrees from ""The Godfather"", which as we all know was excellent (and it also made up stories and facts... but did so exceptionally well).I would predict that virtually anyone that watches this will feel they've wasted their time and come away quite disappointed.I'm the type that believes film critics are way too negative most of the time, but this movie deserves a thumbs-down for certain."
4,"Intended for Adults, Assembly Required","My girlfriend have been using Guard Dog for a while.She's gone through a few pairs, as people continually steal them from her while she's ice skating.Note that assembly is required- generally if you buy them in store, the sales person will offer to assemble it for you free of charge.It's pretty easy to install it yourself- you only need a phil-head screwdriver.The uncut length of this is intended for adults- I would say compatible with size 6+ on adult females, 7+ on males.For kids, you will need to cut these. As they're tough plastic, I'd recommend a saw for quick results.Build is good, molding is great. Make sure you wipe down your blades after use, and use a TERRY CLOTH GUARD on the blades for storage, NOT the skate guards! These are for when you walk around off-ice."
2,"Great colors, but complications","The colors are wonderful, but these covers require some assembly (to fit them to the skate size) and they do not help absorb any moisture left on the skates after use (any leftover moisture on the skates can contribute to rust formation, which permanenty damages the skate blades). If you use a separate cloth to dry the skates, and you assemble these properly, they can be very useful protective covers."
3,only good for figure skates,"I own a pair of these and really like them, so I gave these as gifts for the skaters in my family. Since the males all have hockey skates, these proved a poor choice. Even after adjusting repeatedly they still fall off all the time."
2,"A lot of work, but they work","These guards were time consuming to prepare (you have to cut them to size) and they have fallen apart (the spring pops off now and again) and the springs are already starting to rust after just a couple of weeks of use. They work and the price is right, but I would recommend the caterpillar style over this one."
2,Doesnt Fit,The shipping was awesome on these. I ordered them hoping to get them just before x-mas and they actually arrived 2 days earlier than I expected. They were supposed to be for figure skates but they do not fit around the front of the skates. They stay on only because I had to cut them shorter than the size just to keep enough tension to keep them on. The skates that they are for is a molded skate so that might have something to do with it but they just dont seem to fit around the front properly.
1,Not appropriate for large skates,These consist of two pieces connected with springs. The instructions imply the pieces are long and should be cut to length. However the guards are too short for my size 12 skates leaving a 2+ inch gap where the blades are exposed.
1,Difficult to size,"I bought a pair of these for both my daughter and myself. I did not expect to have to cut through the gel plastic (4 times) to get these to fit my daughter's skates. Also, won't these screws then rust if ice gets on them? Not what I expected. I recommend finding adjustable covers elsewhere...these are a ""make them yourself"" model."
2,not for adults,the guards aren't long enough for adult sized skates and after a couple weeks had holes completely through both ends from the heel and toepick of the skates
5,WOW... bright!,DD loves these skate guards and the color is so vibrant!!! no one else has bright yellow at a competition or even just around the rinks easy to find when they are on the wall! no one will walk away with these!
4,Guard Dog Skate Guards,"I ordered the skate guards not knowing really what to expect, they arrived and were exactly as they were advertised! I am delighted. Thank you for you prompt and courteous service!! I haven't put them to use yet, but will be in the next couple of days!!"
2,I bought this for my new skates,"I bought this for my new skates, I like the color and the looking but It was hard to make them fit my size ten figure skates. they weren't long enough so I had to atach them by making new holes in the extremes of the two pieces. Not very convenient but it worked"
2,Did not like its quality,I personally was not happy with the quality of this product. It was too hard to cut to fit it properly on my daughter's skates size and we don't need to pull it too hard to make it come apart.
2,Amazon purchase,"I ordered two of these guards for my daughters' skates. They fit the size 8 women's shoe, but not the size 6 and there didn't seem to be any way to adjust them."
4,A clever book - within the limits of the Doctor Who universe,"Kursaal is a dark story containing well constructed, essential, and sharp characters that we actually watch change. We catch glimpses of the Doctor's weariness, we see his companion - Sam - with her teeth for much of the story, and the other detective of the story transforms from a glutton into an introspective street-smart chief of police.Angelides credits his reader with a good deal of intelligence. He deals with politics, drugs, capitalism, archaeology, and an alien civilisation that with all its technology and culture raises Kursall at times to the level of the Alien moves. This is a superb story where much is gained yet also much is lost that explores environmental degradation, land rights and the loss of cultural diversity - issues all too topical to our own age."
4,"Loved Sam, not the gore! Risky plot well worth the read!","Enjoyed the idea, but Dr. Who is not a horror movie. I love how Mr. Anghelides wrote Sam. BRAVO! I'm glad you took a risk in this story and I enjoyed it."
1,Still Waiting.....,I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it! For some reason after I ordered it the delivery date got pushed waayy back from the original and the item went out of stock. Even though they charged my credit card right away I'm still waiting to recieve it 3 weeks later... I'm not pleased with amazon or this seller on this purchase. I could have picked one up from the store the same day. Now I'm out the money and still dont have the product. I don't know how many more purchases I'll make with amazon after this one.....
2,Fun but too quiet,We bought this toy for a car trip and you had to hold it to your ear to hear it. Not something a 5 year old wants to do a lot of on a 10 hour trip.
4,"Good toy, but no way to stop it","My daughter loves the toy, but all the adults in the house hate it. It has no 'off' button, so after the child stopped playing, it goes on for another minute until it turns itself off. This can really grind on your nerves, since this is a noisy toy."
3,Wish it had a good volume control...,"as it's not something to take in the car unless you have a very quiet one!I bought this for my son, and it doesn't hold his attention very well. The screen is quite small, so I wouldn't recommend it if you have a child with visual problems."
1,"If they make a 2nd version, it HAS to be better!","This one is very boring, because the graphics are bad, and they move very slow, and that candy-cane-clown-guy's voice sounds like he's saying ""Muh blah to blah doo-too-blah!""They should make a sacond version with BETTER graphics, sounds, and an on/off switch, and maybe the kids and parents won't get bored as quick as they do when they play this game!"
1,Not Impressed at all !!!,My 4 year old daughter has no patience for this game nor do I. I find it frustrating and very hard to hear the audio. The screen is very hard to see. I would not recommend this toy for a 4 year old. It is hard to change it back and forth to a different screens. My daughter needs constant help. Not a good independent toy!
1,Even worse than the Potato Head Electronic Handheld Game,"I remember getting this for Christmas as a child, and I thought it stunk! Mr. Mint's voice was too lame and hard to underetand, and there's no stupid off switch!!!!!!!! I don't reccomand this to anybody, except for garbage cans!"
1,DeWalt DW7187 - good luck calibrating,Calibration is impossible when installed on a DW713? Too much time spent before I gave up and decided to return. Thanks for the aggravation DeWalt.
1,Useless Item!,"This is a useless item. Only works on one side of the blade, left or right, you choose. Needs constant adjustment so it can't be trusted. The laser line obscures the pencil line and is too wide for accurate work. A waste of money!"
5,DeWalt Mitre-Saw Laser,The laser that you have to purchase separately for the DeWalt Mitre Saw is well worh it and it was very simple to do thru Amazon.com. I find it very easy and convenient to use amazon.com.
5,Spot-on Laser line,"Easy for the DIY to install and adjust (about 10 min.) The instructions, from DeWalt, provide detailed installation steps and include illustrations. This product is worth the money to align your precision cuts."
1,No good...,"The laser itself seems to function properly, but it's a pain to install. Once you do, it takes forever to get the laser in alignment. Once you get THAT far, the laser moves once you make a cut or two. I guess the vibration of the saw causes that.Considering that I only use the saw for ""around the house"" projects occasionally, I have found it to be much easier to use the saw without the frustration of this product.Good luck!"
2,Pretty useless...,"I had a choice of what to get with my saw...I, unfortunately, chose this thing.First, install is annoying.Second, adjusting is annoying.Third, the laser moves when you drop the blade. So...you have to set the lazer with the blade raised.The laser just sits there on my saw. I don't ever use it. Speed square and pencil for the win!"
1,Dewalt DW7187 Laser sys,"Kit came with instructions that were not straight forward. The installation was very easy, but I could never get it to align properly so I cannot use the Laser System at all. I'll give it another shot when I am not real busy and can mess with the thing but between the two adjustment knobs and lack of trouble shooting instructions I could not get it to align properly with the intended cut."
1,Don't waste your money,"Wow. DeWalt has really let me down this time. I paid $600 for the 718 saw, which came with a cracked base the first time, brought it back, then the 2nd one has poor plating, ugh. i thought that the laser would at least not let me down. I was so wrong. It wasnt so bad to attach to the saw, but after aligning the parallel & perpendicular axis, i discovered that you can't get the kerf line to fall visibly on the cut line, its off by 1/16"" or more. I tried it on both side of the blade, the left was worse than the right, but both sides dont allow you to be accurate with the side of the blade. This is because the laser is mounted above the blade, so the blade blocks the laser from falling on the cut line, you can get a very dim amount of the line to fal about 1/32"" from the cut, still not acceptable for $70. Also the laser shakes and moves when you make adjustments, and I have no doubt that it will require constant re-alining during work use. A real disappointment."
2,not impressed,"I have years of experience with dewalt miter saws and have kept returning to them after much success. I have seen laser systems before and thought they were a gimick. Since this one carried the dewalt name I thought that it would be professional grade. This is not the case the laser leaves a fat line that is not fine enough for trim and cabinetry work. The laser was easy to put on, but took some time to adjust. After I had it sighted in I found that the line it projects completly covered my pencil line on the board. This attachment is not meant for professionals"
1,Dewalt Laser Is Junk!,"Laser works awesome as long as you only want to cut on left side of blade.If you want to cut on the right side you have to completely readjust the laser. Unfortunately by the time you turn the adjuster 9 turns to move to the other side of the blade there is no more spring tension on the screw. The screw almost comes out of the threads. Personally, when I cut trim I usually make one cut on the left and then one cut on the right. Left, right,left, right and so on. This attachment looks cool on your saw but that's about all it does. Amasingly poor engineering. Two thumbs down."
2,Not for Outdoor Use,"My DeWalt 716 is a fairly good saw, but a laser is really needed to avoid ""trial and error"" cutting. So, I bought the laser to aid in cutting siding for my home. If you are planning to use this laser outdoors, don't bother unless you work after sunset or on VERY cloudy days. On even ""cloudy bright"" days, the laser line is not visible. In bright sunshine, you can't even tell if the laser is ""on"". I never gave this a thought before I purchased the laser. I guess I'll keep it for use indoors after the siding job is done. Setup was kind of a pain, too. The wires were difficult to connect and place in the recess provided. Accuracy seems fair to good, but the alignment screws seem too loose and prone to vibrating out of adjustment. All in all, pretty disappointing, and I certainly wouldn't call this item ""heavy duty"". If I ever buy another miter saw, I think I will look at Makita."
2,not for precision,"I bought this laser along with Dewalts 12 inch double bevel miter saw. Attaching it is easy and alignment wasn't too bad once you figure out how the set screws work. The laser is fairly bright but also wide, maybe 1/32. It is also hard to keep aligned. Everytime I move the saw the laser seems to be off a bit. If you keep all of you cuts to one side of the laser it works okay, but remember to check alignment during the work day, even the vibration from the saw causes it to wander a bit. Save your money and buy a decent blade."
1,Pain,So you had to dig into the site quite deeply to find the video. Hmmmm....but you don't have the courtesy to provide the link...nice.....z
5,DeWalt Miter saw laser system,"Accurate, easy to install, worth the money. Make it easy on yourself, get one!"
3,Could be better,"I purchased the DW7187 as an accessory to my recently purchased DW715 Miter Saw. The installation was reasonably easy. I adjusted the laser according to the directions. Unfortunately, the laser does not retain the settings once a few cuts have been made. As noted in one of the previous posts, the retaining springs are not forceful enough to hold the adjusting screws as adjusted.I like the laser feature, but additional product refinement seems to be in order."
4,not compatible with older Dewalt saws,"DeWalt is not kidding about it not being compatable with any but the newest of their chop saws. I thought I might be able to adapt it to my DW708 - no way. Otherwise, if you have a new saw, it would probably work great."
1,buy the irwin and use the money saved to buy batteries,"High price, low performance. If you want a ""general"" idea of where the cut is going to be, then waste the 70 bucks for it. The problem is that when you adjust it to get close enough to the actual cut made by the blade, the teeth on the blade get in the way and cuts the light output of the laser by 75% or so. Although I only used it to make about 3 cuts before becoming frustrated enough to take it back off, I could imagine that the laser could easily be vibrated out of alignment just because the adjustment screws didn't seem to be very taught. Charge me an extra $70 bucks for the saw and make one with the laser already attached. Three cuts and back to the store it goes."
5,DW7187,"Cousin installed it in about fifteen minutes, works great, really like the seperate power, so that saw doesn't have to start to get a laser on material."
4,Novice woodworker,"The laser is really good, very plain and easy to see. Installing the laser was rather time consuming as I had a hard time fitting the wires under the laser-there is barely enough room."
3,"Tricky setup, does not fit all DW715 saws","My chief complaint is that I had to go back to Lowes to swap my brand new DW715 for the older cast of the same model since the new DW715 has a different handle system than the one this laser is designed to attach. The new DW715 is a completely different (and improved) system, but I really wanted the laser so I settled for the older saw design. I'm still working on getting the laser adjusted correctly."
3,Install and alignment sucks,"Installation is a nightmare, the wire leads they provide are way to short and the cavities they provide to tuck the wires and connectors into are too small. Alignment screws have lots of backlash and very sensitive to pressure. Once the nightmare setup is complete, it seems to work well. Not sure how it will hold alignment since it felt king of sloppy during the laser alignment process."
2,Save your money!,"I purchased this unit and found it hard to setup correctly. Trying to get all of the adjustments just right was a pain. As the blade moves down, the laser line moves as well. I haven't used the saw a lot, but so far I can't detect that it has gotten out of alignment.This only works well if you make cuts with the same side of the saw. If you flip pieces around a lot then you won't be using the laser half the time so why bother at all?I won't be returning it, but neither am I totally happy."
2,Very difficult to install and adjust,"I would describe the laser as a device that was intended to be installed in the factory. Plugging in the connectors was very difficult; placing the connected plugs in the right spaces was very difficult; the adjustments of the laser are confusing. I had to use needle-nose pliers to twist the power supply connectors into a position that would allow me to press the power supply into place. I've read the instructions and tried to adjust the laser, but it's not easy at all to get the line to come down parallel to the saw blade. Part of the problem is that some adjustments are made with the blade down, but most are made with the blade up.My initial reaction on installing it is that it's not an improvement over lining up the cut by eye. Hopefully my opinion will improve once I've managed to properly adjust the laser. I imagine the laser is really intended for cutting moulding, which would be difficult to line up by eye."
1,Unstable!,"Not difficult to adjust, once you practice a little. But the laser won't STAY adjusted! All it takes to throw it out of line is a little semi-rough handling of the saw. Every time I move the saw or put it away the laser is useless the next time I use it unless I adjust it again.There's a lot of potential here, but if it won't stay stable, that pretty much blows the entire value. It's hard to justify 2 or more stars when you're not getting any use at all out of the product.I really have no idea why they gave it ""soft"" adjustments with set screws working against springs -- shouldn't it be tight two-way set screws that won't move except when you turn them? And no springs? Honestly, this laser goes out of adjustment if you so much as slap it on the side with your hand. Case closed."
1,Compatibility Caution,"Although it is stated that this item works with the DW715, DW716, etc. Dewalt has different types (Type 1, Type 2, etc). This item is compatible ONLY with type 1 and type 2 of the various models per the Dewalt website and their customer service. ""Designed exclusively for use on type 1 and type 2 designs of these saws DW713, DW715, DW716, DW717 and DW718 DEWALT miter saws and will not fit any other DEWALT miter saw or any other miter saw brand"". I purchased this DW7187 along with the DW715 and DWX723 stand as a kit only to discover that the DW7187 would not work with the DW715 due to not being a type 1 or 2. Make sure which type you have before purchasing. There should be a ""dummy"" cover on the handle which will need to be removed to attach the laser."
3,Out of calibration,I bought this based on what other owners said about it. Easy to install. Same complaint is that the tension spring that holds the left to right setting for the laser is too weak for the application. I am going replace the weak tensioning spring with a stronger one like one of the owner said.The reason for the 3 stars is because I had to re-engineer an obvious fault with the laser.
5,A must have,"Setting it up was a little difficult at first, once the sensitivity of the adjustments was figured out, it went smoothly after that. After it was all setup it works flawless."
5,DeWalt Miter Saw Laser,"Excellent product, easy to install and adjust, bright laser, hard wired to the saw power supply. I have owned less expensive lasers in the past ie the type that attaches to the saw blade, they work OK but they are not that bright outdoors in direct sun light and they are battery powered with the button type batteries which don't last that long. The DeWalt Laser is a little pricey but well worth the investment, I highly recommend this product."
1,Very hard to adjust.,"This is a very hard laser to adjust. It took me a lot of time to get it to line up while the blade was in the up position and to keep lined up as it came down for the cut. My old Sears laser saw does a better job and cme with the saw. For this price, you would think that they could at least engineer the thing so that it lines up without all the fooling around. At the very least, there should be better instructions, step by step. This is not what I've come to expect from Dewalt. I'm sorry to say that this experience caused me to buy my next power tool from another manufacturer."
3,Difficult To Set Up,"Laser proved helpful, but it was a struggle getting the laser to line up to where your blade is going to hit. Once that was accomplished, cutting the molding was a cinch."
1,waste of money,"I didn't have trouble installing this unit (I'm used to cramming wires into small spaces) but adjusting it was a pain, and I was never able to get it aligned within 1/32"". I suppose that it might be convenient for rough cuts, such as house framing. My advice is to save your money. There are more effective methods to line up your cuts.I still use it as a safety feature; I check before cutting if the red line is near my hand.UPDATE: I replaced this with the DEWALT DWS7085 Miter Saw LED Work Light System; the Work Light System is much better."
1,Dewalt DW7187 Laser System,I purchased this item because I thought it would provide superior performance to some cheaper alternatives since it was made specifically for the saw purchased. I have found it difficult to calibrate and impossible to maintain in calibration for more than a few cuts - I would not recommend it at all.[...]
1,major dissapointment,this is the worst tool addition i have ever owned. you adjust the beam and make a cut then it moves on you again. finally when you think you have it down it is not accurate worst dewalt tool i have ever owned. will try the new led light instead if reviews are better than this otherwise ill stick to the old fashion way.
1,Worthless,"About 90% of all my tools are Dewalt, so needless to say I'm a pretty big fan... But this laser is straight junk... Very hard to adjust and it doesn't stay true... Also you laser line will move as you are coming down to cut your material... To bad I can't at least use it as a coat hanger... Don't waste your money..."
4,Very fun game,This game is a lot of fun. Great for hand eye cordination. My 1 year old did get ahold of one of the fishing poles and really tore it up but other than that it has held up well.
4,Too Loud? Try this:,My younger kids absolutely adore this game but it's super loud!!If you put a piece of tape (duct tape etc.) over the speaker on bottom it reduces the decibile level by about half!Hope that helps:)
2,We heard it through the box when we were moving...,"My kids really never play board games, so I only really had to listen to it maybe a dozen times in the two years the kids had it. They tended to have problems getting the fish hooked (even my husband did), and as other people have said, it's quite loud. We were unloading the truck when we moved, and could hear it through the box across the garage. Jostling the box will turn on the thing, and you can't turn it off outside the box (at least, I've never been able to get it to shut off without rearranging the contents of the box). If they'd made the song a little slower (so you didn't hear so many repetitions), or a bit quieter, it would have been less annoying. I was lucky that the kids didn't play it too often."
3,Annoying longer than it is fun....,"My kids had this toy when they were younger and I HATED it. They were actually pretty interested in it for the first month. After that it only saw occasional use. What I still remember though is how annoyingly repetitive the music was. At least it was in tune, unlike some musical toys.The pieces are quite durable (I still find them occasionally) but they are easily separated and scattered, making the set less usable. I don't recommend this toy."
5,This is my 2 year old's favorite game.,This game was my 2 year old's favorite thing he received for Christmas. He is still playing with at least a couple of times a week. The song can drive you a little crazy. We actually covered the speaker with masking tape so it is not as loud. The game teaches colors and small hand coordination. Both of my kids really enjoy it.
4,great birthday gift for 3-6 year olds,"My son received this as a gift for his 4th birthday and it was a hit with all the kids there, ages 3-50.It is one of the rare toys that he still plays with a year later. What I loved about this is that he can play it by himself or with friends. It is very easy and entertaining."
5,Lots Of Variety On This One,"D.A.P. is back with a very different lineup for their 3rd album. Project leader Adam Levin remains, but there are no other carryovers from the previous album. The vocal duties are handled by Jennifer Huff which lends the album a very different feel from the more gruff vocal work by Ray Weston on the previous disc. Overall I think this is a better album than the previous one. The addition of John McCloskey on guitar really makes a difference on several tracks. The almost metallic ""Sparks"" Fly"" features a McClosky and Levin guitar duel that serves as one of the most energetic tracks that this band has done. New vocalist Huff sings on 4 tracks and 4 are all instrumental. Levin's Warr guitar and Huffs half sung half spoken vocals work in tandem on ""Night Embrace"" to create a well done moody atmospheric piece. The final track ""Embers"" works in a similar fashion. This album covers a lot of musical ground and should appeal to a wide variety of progressive rock fan."
4,Serling is great.,"I have this and how can you not rate anyting by Rod Serling highly. In fact this is Serling's only published fiction not counting adaptations of Twilight Zone/Night Gallery and his only original fiction, so far as I know. It is a real tragedy that he didn't write and publish more fiction, but comments he made in his last interview lead me to believe he was convinced he could only write scripts and wasn't good enough to write fiction (novels, etc.). Writers tend to be insecure but it's such a shame he went so far as to never write novels or short stories outside of his scriptwriting. Of course we'll always have the Twilight Zone but as far as original fiction is concerned, this book is all we have from him."
