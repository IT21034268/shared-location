4,As Expected,"Vendor was great, shipped fast. Book is pretty good for those wanting to explore Japanese cooking and tradition. Lots of information and tasty food."
5,just what i wanted...,"no, wait, just what i needed (coffee), a replacement carafe. had problems with an online warehouse waited a week before i was told it hadn't even been ordered yet. Amazon was fast & efficient. TY!"
4,Replacement Carafe,The replacement Carafe is fine other than the glass seems a little more fragile than most other coffee pots. That is probably why I broke the first one. I keep looking for an aluminum one but haven't found a 14 cup.
5,cuisinart carafe,"It's a little pricy, but it is the carafe that fits my Cuisinart coffeemaker. I am very pleased with it."
1,Carafe,Did not propery fit my Cuisinant coffe maker. Would not sit properly on heat plate. Very poorly made
3,Replacement Coffee Pot,"What can I say? It's a coffee pot! I ordered it as a replacement for the original that one of my kids broke. I thought $27 bucks was a bit pricey but that's what I get for buying a Cuisinart but that's also why I gave it a '3' rating. It should really go for $10 - $12 USD.Anyway I got the pot, it came on time, was packaged well, I washed it out, it fit perfectly in my machine .... I made coffee. No runs, no drips, no errors."
5,Perfect Replacement,"This was a perfect replacement for our broken coffee pot. We could not find this locally, so we were pleased to find it available on Amazon!"
2,Easily broken,"The design is good but this product is very fragile.We have broken two in the last year.Since this is a replacemnt for the coffee maker, I would think twice before buying the Cuisinart coffee maker, with this carafe."
2,From one extreme to another...,"I would like to think I am a ""moderate"" muslim; pursuing the ""middle"" way. El Fadl although providing insights in to extremism and the ""Puritans"" thinking; then makes exactly the same mistake! El Fadl mentions how the ""puritans"" have their own lense (ie filter their understanding of the Quran and the Sunna to impose their extreme prejudices) but then he does the same by stating his own extreme ""personal"" wishes and views, thereby completing undermining himself.El Fadl sensationalisation (similar to tabloid newspapers) will appeal to the layman and combined with his so called references to ""classical sources"", it will also pass for knowledge and scholarship to the layman.It should be noted that none of the renowned masters of the Hadith recognise El Fadl as a student in the field, never mind a scholar."
2,His playing is at its most unemotional and mechanical here,"I'm sorry but this is at best decent aural wallpaper. Hargrove has done so much better work and much more inspired blowing on albums like ""Family"" and ""Tenor of Our Time."" He offers nothing unique to these ballads at all. There is no interpretation or romance. These are mostly very dry, mechanical renditions of standards. ""Family,"" ""Tenor of . . ,"" and ""Parker's Mood"" are far more interesting and pleasurable to listen to."
1,Haven't even used this,"I was given one of thse at my baby shower. My son is almost 4 months old now and I still haven't used it. It hangs funny from the seat and seems as though it would just get in the way if someone wanted to sit back there (there should be a strap at the bottom to hold it to the seat). I have a tub of wipes in my truck but that won't fit in any of the pockets, there all really small. Also I live in AZ and if you leave much of any thing in your vehicle it will melt, I can just see the melted crayons now! This winter I might use it to keep a small extra blanket in but for the most part Id rather just use my diaper bag as even if I did use this Id have to transfer stuff to the diaper bag every time we got out of the truck which is a major PITA."
2,Don't buy it!,"First of all, I want to say that the credits are the best part. You get to see Captain Scarlet getting killed in several imaginative ways (search Captain Scarlet Credits on YouTube and you'll find it). They are constantly making dumb mistakes that drive us a little crazy. The only ""good"" episode was ""Attack On Cloudbase"" which was SO bad it was hilarious.As I said, it's a waste of money."
1,DVD / Episodes do not play,"The DVD does not work at all in my laptop. I have never had any problem with any other DVD.The first and last episode on every disc cannot be played in a DVD player(8 total episodes).I am not the first person to complain about the issue so it is the DVD, not damage caused by shipping. This item should not be bought. Quite frankly it should not be available for purchase in this condition."
3,I expected to like this more,"And I'm not sure why I don't. Maybe it's the tone--very dark, none of the humor that you see in all the other series. Maybe it's because in comparison with the other shows, there aren't as many cool gadgets, which is the real appeal of Anderson for me. One example--in one episode, the only special effects, other than stock footage of the angels landing, are a house sinking into the ground and a very boring car chase. Or maybe it's the fact the the Mysterons, who are never seen, are the most boring villians to appear in an Anderson series. Not the most obnoxious though--that honor would have to go to Zelda and her cronies on ""Terrahawks."""
1,Captain Scarlet,"I bought this as a gift and the first set had defective sound on all four DVDs. Amazon quickly replaced this with a new DVD set, which turned out to be even more defective than the first. I don't know anything about the cartoon or its production values, but I can tell you that the distributor made a very poor-quality product."
5,My situation was Unique? ha!,"This book is full of things you don't want to read. We all think our situations are unique, our loves are special, our relationships with married men are different. Ha! This book dispels all those lies we tell ourselves to make it okay. It opened my eyes to the reality of the situation and the realization that every affair is the same. It was an eye opener and it really did help me.As to the affair itself, my guy dumped me to work on things with the wife just as the book said they usually do. Time has passed and he has decided to leave his wife and get a divorce. We are trying to pick things up and make a relationship work. Does this make my affair different? Not really... but sometimes the outcome is different. I guess I got a guy in the 1% of men who really do leave their wives..."
5,Excellent! A sobering must-read!,"Although this book is short, it covers all the emotions involved with having an affair. The brutal truth may shock you (my heart was pounding as I read it!) but it is just the dose of reality needed to inspire you to take control of your life. I would definitely recommend this book whole-heartedly to any woman involved with (or contemplating) a married man - READ THIS BOOK!!! -it just might save you a lot of heartache!"
2,Very little new information,"I read ""This Affair is Over"" while anxiously awaiting some answers for questions regarding my relationship with a MM. While I enjoyed the reading, I did not read any new information that I hadn't already read or been told. I was very disappointed. The book didn't tell me how to cope any better or how to be strong and end it forever. It was mostly full of examples...same story that all of us in this situation live. We already know the life..give us some answers."
4,Great binoculars for the price,"Clear picture and easy to focus. 10x50, so you're not going to get a great close up, and there are certainly better optics at higher prices, but for the price you can't beat them."
3,Pentex Whitetails unlimited 10X50 Binoculars,The binoculars came on time and well wrapped they are ok but not outstanding however the price was very fair. I am planning a vacation and these will be a back up to my other binoculars.
1,Misrepresentation of product,"I got these for my father for Christmas. The ad says ""Pentax"" but no where on them did it say that. My father told me yesterday that I could send them back..........he did not want them. I am disappointed."
2,Pentax Whitetails Binocular,"I bought this binocular from Amazon. When it arrived, I was surprised by the packaging. It was packaged like a cheap toy in plastic covering and nowhere was Pentax name identified. I thought that i might have made a mistake buying something else so I went back to Amazon and sure enough this was a Pentax product. Except Pentax do not want to put their name on it.It was easy to see why. It was heavy, heavier than all my binoculars ( I have 7 of them), the necklace was a joke, the case a cheap piece of cloth vinyl. Everything about it was cheap. So we do get what we pay for. Frankly because I had to cut the plastic to access the binocular, I did not want to return it to Amazon.On the plus side, the optics were OK but not great. But nowhere near the Pentax quality that I had expected. This was Whitetails not Pentax.I would gladly pay more for a better quality product.I had bought this product having read the previous poster review so I am compelled to write this review."
4,Solid Value,"Good value, these appear to be well made, great feel to them and do a good job for watching birds at a feeder from inside. (Needs to be about 30 feet away.) Specs are about right combination so one gets a good magnification, and doesn't have too much trouble with the field of vision being too ""jerky"". NB other than the title of the product, it appears to have nothing to do w/ Pentax, you will not find their name anywhere but on Amazon."
4,The sizes are bigger than listed,It works good but it is bigger than the listed size. I brought it because the listed size is smaller than others. but it came with the same standard size as a 10X50 binocular
4,Great product!!!,I like this binoculars. They provide great clarity and handling. Easy to work with. Comes with a neat bag with wipe cloth. A great price and value.
5,Pentax white tail binoculars.,Cant get a better pair of binoculars for the money. Very satisfied with the quality of the product. They are a little heavy but they are not to heavy for what I use them for.
3,"OK, within it's limitations","I have been looking to purchase my own tone and probe kit, and I saw this one. We have the same model at my work, and it has some serious limitations. I mostly need a kit to trace cat5/cat6, and this kit has a lot of trouble with our environment, even if the other end is not connected to a switch. If it is, forget about it, this will not work. That being said, if all you need to do is to trace some telephone or speaker wire, it will probably do the job. Just be sure you know the limitations of what it is capable of. I've been eyeing the Fluke IntelliTone Pro 200, myself. It is around double the price, but a much more capable kit. If you're going to be working in an environment that will have many active network cables, that would be a much better choice."
1,Worthless,"Has tremendous 60Hz hum in normal residential environment, didn't even test it in more demanding commercial or industrial environments. The hum masks the signal to the point where I almost have to touch the cable to hear any signal at all. No way can I use it to trace cables in a wall. Totally worthless."
4,A Real Pimp,"Not much to say. The book was in good condition and arrived on time. I met Al Palmquist a number of years ago, and have always been impressed by his courage and convictions, as well as the number of young girls he rescued."
4,Minnesota Connection,"I bought this book for my father. He received it in time for Christmas, and it was in excellent condition. A very good read, however it was quite unsettling. I'm extremely impressed with Amazon's services."
5,Should be a required read,"This book should be a required read for all parents and young folks. I imagine the relevance remains true, or more so, than when this book was originally written.BGen Ron Tottingham PhD"
3,government report,"""The book certainly calls into qeuestion the credibility of Palmquist, but the story that he presents seems to have had a permanent effect on this country. ... It is a story that will not die, regardless what the actual findings may be. Our findings differ significantly from Palmquist's.""from ""Sexual Exploitation of children: A Report to the Illinois General Assembly""by the Illinois Legislative Investigating Commission (ILIC) (page 13)"
1,Cheaper viable alternative,"If you're buying this lamp to replace yourself, you might as well go this route: [...]It will take you 10 minutes longer and will save you 50% or more depending on weather you buy a Sony or aftermarket lamp.It's very simple to replace the bulb inside the assembly."
1,Sucks!!,People should not be allowed to sell any item that is no longer up to date with today's systems. This would be a great game if there was an out of date system to run it!!!
1,Don't buy this game (unless you have and OLD computer),I remember this game being REALLY fun! I bought it to show my girlfriend and it turns out that IT DOESN'T WORK ON NEWER MACS! Craptastic...If you're rocking an old (Pre 10.4 OS I believe) Mac have a go but otherwise consider yourself warned.
4,decent,"the spinner is horrible, it works well enough, but could have been better. but the game is fun with the replay being moderate."
2,Dissapointed!,"Not even close to what we thought this game would be. Highly dissapointed! The rules were not designed for children to understand. The board did not have a clear starting spot, and the spinner caused arguing between the players. The younger player age 7 had fun but big brother 16 and Dad gave me (mom) dirty looks and sarcastic ""Thank you's"" for bringing the game home. My 13 year old Star Wars Addict was not home to play this evening and when he returns I am afraid no one will agree to play again. My advice...If it's not broke don't fix it. Stick with the old classic ""THE GAME OF LIFE"" You know what you are getting with no dissapointment."
2,Stories,"This is not a book on haunted locations in California. Instead it is a collection of stories that occurred to people in California. You won't find the Queen Mary in here or Alcatraz or the Hotel Del Coronado or any other location that you can physically visit. Instead you will find stories that happened to real Californians in their homes, businesses, etc.If you're looking for interesting real ghost stories, this is a book for you. It is an interesting read, and the stories are entertaining. If you're looking for detailed information on specific visitable concrete locations within California this is not the book for you."
5,wow,"I was not that interested in my religion, but after i read this book I wanted to know so much more. This book is so interesting I coud not believe how detailed and exciting this book was. I recommend this book for eveyone even if you are not of the faith!"
1,This is not for office use,This is more for home use not everyday office use. If you only need to use a fax machine for twice a year then go right ahead and use this. I hate this fax machine. I can't even scan 10 pages without it crumpling the paper or it usually grabs about 3 pages at a single time. I need something that can handle work and this fax machine can't do the job.
1,Avoid this and other Brother Fax Machines,"I had this machine and the 2800 for my small office. Mind you I sent faxes and rarely received them. Even with that I only sent 2 a day. After 4 months the 4800 went and after 5 months the 2800 went. Both times I got intense black lines on the pages I faxed, not knowing until a customer told me and caused embarassment on my end. Nothing could be done to repair it. I was told it was more than likely the drum which sold for more than the fax. End result both in the garbage.Avoid all brother products at all costs. My brother (how ironic) bought a brother laser jet and had a problem after 6 months and also had to toss it. Save your money."
2,Don't do it,"I had a Brother word processor before PC's were hip, so I thought I'd be ok with a Brother printer. Not! It no longer scans, if I want to print I have to un-plug it and plug it back in for each job. Ink cartridges don't last long at all. It faxes ok!Sorry, when it comes to printers spend a few extra bucks and buy HP. I wish I did."
1,can't keep it straight,"The MFC-4800 I purchased has been a serious disappointment. Although Brother was willing to replace it twice, they were not willing to acknowledge there are engineering problems with the model itself. In short, the machine does not keep all of the lines straight (and running parallel) across a page it is copying. Unless Brother has since corrected this problem, I would definitely stay away from this machine if you are looking for professional quality copying."
2,"That multifunction that does not last,",I agree with all tbe disatisfied customers.The Drum and toner needs replacement to often.White lines all over the place when you print.I am now looking to purchase another multifunctionbut not Brothers. Don't buy.
1,A highly infuriating product,"This is hands down the worst printer I have ever owned. When I purchased the printer, I bought a warranty from the Staples. Since then, I have had countless problems, bought countless ink cartridges (the printer seems to like sucking them dry, whether or not I do any printing), and have had a replacement sent - this one has lasted even less than the first one.On the basis of my experience with this printer, I do not plan on ever purchasing another Brother product again. Finally, a quick glance through Web sites where costumers discuss Brother MFCs tells me that I am not alone in my sentiment."
5,Great Customer Service,"Product works great. Has all the features one could want. I have it working as printer, fax, copier and scanner. I can use parallel port with one PC and USB with another PC so I can have a common printer without a network!Above all the customer service is GREAT. If you call on Thurs. or Friday you can get someone in minutes and they take you step by step and bend over backwards to solve the problem.BUY IT!!!"
3,next time: HP,"The machine was everything I want -- but only for the lifetime of the toner drum. Now ... I admit that it's lasted longer than any inkjet I've ever owned, and at a lower per-print cost. The cost of toner drums, however, is prohibitive, and remanufactured drums for this unit stink -- at least insofar as I've been able to find. (If you don't mind a grey caste on all your printouts, the generics and remans are fine, but my eyes don't like the haze. If you're a reader, yours won't either.) For HP, we've got a local recharge outfit with high-quality replacement cartridges -- I guess size, in HP's case, builds quality all the way down the line."
1,Every bad review on here is true,"The Brother MFC 4800 Multifunction Printer, Scanner, Copier & Fax is the worst in the industry. I've gone through two in 18 months. I will never a buy Brother product again. Don't be fooled by the low prices, there is a reason for that."
1,"Software and drivers are glitchy, Slow","Would not recommend. Just bought a Canon L170 to replace it. Software kept adding another copy into my printer folder, sometimes they would be online, other times offline. Sometimes it would print, other times I had to restart my computer to even recognize it. I know Windows is not without blame, but Brother's incoherant support staff in Micronesia wasted 3 (Three!) frikin' hours of my time and solved nothing. Hp drivers are pigs, Brother's can't seem to find a way to work, Lexmark has never impressed me and Epson makes me cringe so I moved on to Canon. I have Canon inkjets and scanners and have never had an issue."
1,Reconsider before you make a big mistake.,"These machines are known for placing random ink marks on your paper after a jamb. If you have paper jamb inside the machine (as opposed to in the feeder), you will inevitably have random black marks on every page thereafter. It has been a continuing problem and since Brother doesn't have a fix for it, they tell you to replace, you guessed it, the $160 drum unit! That's over half the price of what they sold the machine to us for. Think twice before buying. As stated before, the scanning and copying on this unit leave a lot to be desired."
1,A piece of crap,I'm about to chuck this machine after years of it sitting. What a waste of money. Was there a class action lawsuit on this machine ?I decided to never buy another Brother product after buyng this machine.
5,Wonderful Show! My son loves it!!,My four year old loves this show! He laughes a lot while watching it. It's a refreshing change and doesn't drive parents crazy like some shows do! Highly recommend this DVD! We watched it first on Noggin and he liked it so much we got the DVD. Episodes:- Nelson the Elephant- Adam the Armadillo- Herbert the Warthog- Pauline the Pelican- Toby the Tortoise- Doris the Duck- Wally the Wombat- Melanie the MooseWe like it so much we are going to order the other one that was just released.
2,Boring,"I bought this for my son,b/c he loves animals..Didn't think the reviews were that bad.But my son has no interest.He watches it for 2 minutes and is DONE!!Kinda boring too!"
5,Easier Than You Think,"The book ignites a fast spark. I've never had a clue on how to get started in business. Once I put the book down, it totally changed my way of thinking!"
5,You couldn't pay me 10X to give it back!,"I've just finished reading Ray's new book and I'm utterly stunned! The book is without question the most practical, actionable and surefire system that I've ever seen."
2,Lots of useless info,"This was nothing more than a collection of information I could have gotten with a quick google search. Nothing revolutionary or ""secretive"" about the info here."
3,Painfully effective,I was interested to learn that most girls are willing to star in a porn film with me just to spite their overbearing husbands. The book needs to cover self defense more thuroughly.
5,"To film makers, adult traffic is crazy for my video","This book was a blast to read. I heard about Ray West from a forum as being a guru to adult film making. After reading, I know why! Eventhough his book is 2001, I am going after his new stuff. I just can't imagine as a film maker how much fun this book has brought to my life. Ray West, you are a true genius."
5,Fantastic Sounds,"I had never heard of Wayanay Inka until I saw them live in San Antonio, Texas. They were playing at the outdoor market. A friend and I sat for hours listening. I was absolutely captured by their music. Actually watching the variation in instruments that they play was incredible. I highly recommend all their CD's. I bought several there where they were playing. Others include ""Enchanted Feeling"" & ""De...Los Andes"""
5,Andean Surprises,"They've learned their lessons well: their technique on zamponas and sittus (pan pipes) is outstanding, and though they play many of the familiar and favorite Andean tunes, they also compose a number of their own songs: they're not afraid to tackle something out of the ordinary for an Andean group - a Bach minuet, for instance, on their first cd THE FLIGHT OF THE CONDOR, which is filled with such surprises."
3,"Still mostly cardboard characters, but finally some plot!","Mostly enjoyable romp through the World of Darkness. Only rarely a page-turner. Most memorable scene is the final battle between the Malkavian Prince of Atlanta and the Brujah Archon versus the Sabbat. It leaves many open paths for other books to follow, such as The General surviving the attack unnoticed."
2,Tolerably well-written.,"This is a passable action-based, hack-and-slash story with very little else to recommend it. Detailing the bloody war between two factions of vampires, one of which is merely cruel, manipulative, bloodthirsty (in both the literal and figurative meanings of the word) and soulless, the other of which is actually the bad guys, the story also suffers from a lack of beginning or end, being as it is merely the second in a thirteen-novel storyarc. (The Tzimisce of the title are one of the ""clans"" or bloodlines, of the more vicious of the two factions, and are themselves vile and sadistic (to say nothing of psychotic) enough to make ""normal"" vampires seem mild by comparison.)"
1,Two stars for the attempt... minus one for the delivery,"Though not as poorly written as the first book in the lamentable Clan Novel series, Tzimisce never rises about boring to ever reach the level of Bad. The sad part is that Tzimisce had such potential. The Tzimisce are a facinating clan constructed of dicotomy, yet the plastic characters in this novel never stretch beyond boring.When reading this book I was hoping to be at LEAST horrified, if not engaged ir interested, but Eric Griffen committed the greatest crime and author can commit, he neither made me hate him nor love him... he merely bored me."
4,good but,"It should try and have table of content as well as page number...hard to get direct quotes without them. The travel novel itself was hilarious though, every scary situation he was put into turned into a comical moment similar to what Robert Downey Jr does with his characters."
4,Good but not great Twain,"There's much to like in this book, particularly the first two-thirds as he describes traveling west in a stagecoach, tries his luck at silver mining in Nevada and describes early San Francisco, including an earthquake. It bogs down toward the end, though, in mostly aimless ramblings in Hawaii.For Kindle owners, you don't have to pay for this book. Like many 19th century classics, it's available for free on Gutenberg and other like-minded sites. [...]"
5,Must Read,"A gem that I am glad I finally got around to reading. Any serious reader with an open mind about religion, politics, and living will immensely enjoy this book; others won't. So to paraphrase the old adage, if you enjoyed the book, review it and give it the deserved five stars; if you didn't enjoy it, please keep it to yourself and not tarnish this gem. It deserves to be read by future readers for many years to come."
5,glad I read this book,I recently started reading some Mark Twain classics that I had never read before. I am so glad I did-I never really appreciated how brilliant and funny he was.
5,Hilarious jounrye across America,"Mark Twain achieves a remarkable feat in this book, he manages to write a travel book even funnier than 'Innocents Abroad', which I wouldn't have thought possible. His riveting account of his travels west across the country is packed with fascinating and amusing incidents and anecdotes. I was almost in hysterics when I read about Twain and a group of friends beimng held at bay by a boxful of escaped Tarantulas, and again reading about his bizarre encounters with the preposterous Mormons in Utah. As in Innocents Abroad, humour is woven in with serious observations on the places he visits and their inhabitants. His account of his visit to Hawaii is particularly fascinating, but the whole book is unforgettable."
4,along came a spider,"I enjoyed this book very much. Pertaing to Along Came A Sprider. I think some people forget these books are fiction only and meant for entertainment. I also have a kindlekeyboard . Is the kindlefire worth the difference. I also enjoy Baldacci, Grisham, J.A. Jance. I al;so have been happy with everything from Amazon as far as books."
4,Roughing It,"Classic Sam L. Clemens writing, evocative of the historic period, available digitally, and now a part of my Kindle book collection."
4,Funny and full of crazy adventures,"Another book I chose to read while on a recent California trip. Roughing It is an account of Twain's life in the West. Twain travels with his brother to California and Nevada during the time of the Gold Rush.Twain looks for silver, has run-ins with bad guys, and observes the West in its early days with humor and cleverness. Lots of politically incorrectness that probably struck the readers of the day as hilariously funny. Pretty funny to me, too."
5,"ROUGHING IT (MISSION AUDIO) BY MARK TWAIN, READ BY ROBIN FIELD","Actor Robin Field reads Mark Twain's second full-length work, published 'in 1872, describing his actual and imaginary adventures in the American 'West in the 1860s. According to Guy Cardwell (editor of the Library of 'America edition), ""His accounts of stagecoach travel, Indians, Western 'dress, food and customs, frontier society, the Mormons, the Chinese . . '. are intermingled with his own experiences as a prospector, miner, 'journalist, boon companion and lecturer as he traveled through Nevada, 'Utah, California and even to the Hawaiian Islands. . . . The plot is 'relaxed enough to accommodate some immensely funny and quite random 'character sketches, animal fables, tall tales and dramatic monologues."" ' The reading is approximately 20 hours long on 18 Audio CDs."
3,Long full of bull account of Twain's adventures!,"Twain here exhibits his propensity to write, and write, and write... As long and boring as some of this book was, I am glad I read it. His adventures are interesting and more than anything it is a time piece; his inflections and nuances of verb and colloqualisms make for a difficult read, but it is worth it if you have the time. This ain't a thriller"
5,Twain's best travel writing,Twain's escapades in the West make fascinating reading.His encounters with the Mormons in Utah are particularlyinteresting. Anyone afflicted with Mormon missionaries onhis or her doorstep ought to bring out a copy of this book andread aloud the chapter in which Twain discusses the absurdBook of Mormon. Nobody can match Twain in skewering foolishnessand pomposity dressed up as religion.
2,Bad Edition,"The book - that is to say the text by Mark Twain is wonderful. The kindle version not so much. First of all there are typos, quite a few of them for a published work. Second, there are no pictures. The real book has pictures, so I think I am going to buy a copy of the book and re-read it."
2,NOT BELIEVABLE,WHEN I PURCHASED THIS BOOK I WAS EXPECTING A TRUE ACCOUNT OF MARK TWAINS EXPLOITS. IT WAS FUNNY BUT AFTER AWHILE I REALIZED THAT TWAIN TOOK HIS EXPLOITS AND TWISTED THE FACTS TO MAKE THE STORY MORE EXCITING. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF HE JUST DESCRIBED HIS EXPERIENCES WITHOUT EXXAGERATING.
3,Roughing It by Mark Twain,"The book is in good condition, but the font size is so small you almost need a magnifying glass to read it!"
1,hm...,"i've been reading the reviews for this book, and I wanted to offer up my own opinion. I first read this book as part of my high school 11th grade english cirriculum. And as a warning to others, I just wanted to say that reading this book was like watching paint dry. There is no structure, and after a while it seems like your just reading page after page but are retaining nothing. Though there are some very interesting funny parts in the books, the overall dullness of it all overpowers the good. At some points, I wanted to claw my eyes out in despair.I admit, I do love Mark Tawin, but this is in Noo sense, his best work.Ones again, this is just my opinion. Read it and see for yourself."
1,Nice Idea...Poor Design,"This seemed like a great idea to me. I was actually going to buy a tray to attach to my son's car seat and saw this item and tried it. Big Mistake! My son can take it off of his car seat, it doesn't attach tightly enough. He also knocks it off if he's reading a large book or playing with his Leap Pad. Love the idea, but wish I would have read the reviews first. Don't waste your money."
1,Nice idea - needs work,"I, too, wish that I would have read the reviews. We have a Britax Marathon. There is no hope in the world that it will fit. Oh, well. I'm taking it back."
1,Waste of Money!!,"I bought this for my sons carseat. My daughters carseat came w/ a cupholder but his didn't so i got this one that says it works on all carseats. It didn't fit either carseat, nor any of my friends kids carseats. I did get it to work on my Jeep double umbrella stroller but then my kids fight over it, and I am NOT wasting more money and gettin a second one. I am so disappointed in this cupholder all together. My son was so excited to have his own little snack/cup holder and this is a piece of junk!"
1,Not worth it,I bought this product and was so frustrated at the fact that it just doesn't tighten enough to be secure. My 13 month old daughter quickly figured out how to take the lid off. It's wobbly and cheap. Very disappointed with this Fisher-Price product.
1,Tendentious rendering,"Deacon Dardess's tendentious rendering of the Quran in this book will not help Catholics seeking to understand where the truths and worldviews contained in the holy books of Christianity and Islam converge and diverge.The reason is that he is far too enamored of the type of interreligious diologue that held sway in the United States during the confusion that followed the Second Vatican Council. The Council itself warned against this, cautioning Catholics to avoid ""a false conciliatory approach.""Catholics seeking a more balanced guide to the differences and similarities between their faith and Islam are advised to purchase ""Inside Islam: A Guide for Catholics"" by Robert Spencer and Daniel Ali, an Iraqi convert to Christianity from Islam. The end of the Ali/Spencer book contains a useful table of passages from the Bible and Quran concerning a range of topics."
1,Loved It Till It Crashed,"Ok, i got this for my b-day (September) last year. It's May now. The player was awesome at the beginning. I loved the resume funtion, how light it was, the AM/FM, etc. Sometime between then and February, through no fault of mine, the volume stopped working. The player was jammed on a neutral volume which would not change. Later, around March, I lost the sound in my right headphone except when I twisted the cord a certain way. This was also for no apparent reason. By now I have completely lost the sound in it. This all happened in a little more than half a year. It would be more expensive to fix the Discman than to buy a new one. So here I am searching for a new one.Trust me on this: Maybe it was my fault, but for me this Discman definitely did not work."
4,Very good with only minor complaints,"This player is really good. The display is lighted, and it's bright enough that you can see the function keys in the dark. It includes a handy carrying case for when you run or skate.A couple of minor complaints: 1. When the player is inside the case, the only keys that can be reached are the play, stop, fast forward, and rewind. That's slightly annoying. 2. The display does not remain lighted if the power source is from the batteries. 3. The slide latch can be difficult to operate, especially if you already have a CD in one hand.Other than that, this is a really good buy, and the skip protection is just excellent. I have ridden my bike down a very rough dirt raod and I never heard it skip that whole time I was on that road."
1,Not so electric,Bought this for our 6-year-old son - the microphones are okay & work. The guitar is terrible. There were no instructions in English at all. Spend your money on something else.
2,Sounds more like Dakota Staton but with less personality...,"This is a tribute by Vanessa Rubin to jazz legend Carmen McRae(who recorded the masterpiece ""Carmen Sings Monk"") who was heavily influenced by and wrote songs for the legendary Billie Holiday. Rubin sounds more like a mellow Dakota Staton, but a lot less interesting, more along the lines of the blase and very dull Nancy Wilson... However I give her more credit then Natalie Cole, at least Rubin didn't try to do some tacky duet with Ms McRae, the way Cole did with her father. We'll have to wait for someone like Anita O'Day to do a tribute album effectively to Ms McRae. Also the great jazz singer Carol Sloane did a wonderful tribute CD to Carmen McRae called ""The Songs Carmen Sang"" which is really spectacular, especially since Sloane was a personal friend of McRae's."
4,An embedded developer point of view,"Who does ""classic shell scripting"" nowadays?Maybe some IT geek, hackers, linux distribution developers... and embedded engineers!If you develop embedded system based on linux, you will have to do with sh scripts & friends.You can do a lot of things with a good script, better than writing your-own-cross-compiled-c-code.This book can help you in going deep and use the power you have immediately available even on the smallest linux busybox installation.I liked it, I enjoyed reading it, and it helped (and helps) me in my work.I found the awk chapter a bit less good, but this is not a book on awk."
1,"Poor performance, infuriating customer service","I purchased this fan several months ago. Soon after purchasing, the motor blew on it. I understand that sometimes things go wrong, so I contacted the Air King customer service. Their attitude was completely hostile to me from the very beginning. First they said they would send a replacement, then they said I would have to ship it back and they may or may not fix it. The single worst customer service experience I've ever had- it made going to the DMV seem like good times..."
3,Cute kids book,"Got this for my kids. It's okay. Wished I'd tried to get it from the library, 'cause it doesn't give you the whole feeling of the city, being in drawings instead of photos."
5,one of my favorite entries in the sasek series!,"sasek's books are all visually lovely, no doubt about it, however they are also incredibly informative, which i quite appreciate. this book is littered with amazing images and interesting facts. i would definitely say this entry has some of the more whimsical (the pigeons page!) and exotic (the grand canal) images present in sasek's books.and as with all the updated printings of sasek's books, there is a welcome list of ""this is the city...today!"" at the end of the book with changes listed since the original printing. it is great to see both the way the city WAS as well as the present day differences.i highly recommend this book if you are interested in either venice, or simply in wonderful illustration."
3,Not what expected,"This is a lovely big picture book in a fabulous fifties sort of style - got it for my 9 year old, but because it is a big picture book, it feels like it' s for ' babies.' However, if she was a little younger - then the style wouldnt be quite appropriate either- too sophisticated. I think the real target audience is the parent."
3,It's ok,"Eh, it works ok. Chops veggies into big chunks - if you want things properly diced you have to fish them out and send them through a second time which can be frustrating. Doesn't do terribly well with onions. Frankly, I hardly ever remember to get it out to use it - more work cleaning it up than it saves me in chopping. Wish I'd gotten one of those little chopping jars instead - that's what I was replacing and I found it to be a lot more useful for my needs than this thing is."
2,poor craftmanship,"Item is already in trash. Blades separated from holder and broke.Also blades did not cut very well ,just were not sharp enough.Would not buy again."
1,Very disappointed with this product.,"I tried to chop an onion with this chopper, even though I chopped the onion in small chunks it would not go through the largest grid. So I then dried to chop and egg for making egg salad, the egg stuck to the dicing pusher, so after each egg I had to clean the pusher off. It took more time to try to chop the eggs than if I would have chopped each one myself individually."
2,Kathy,Disapointed in this product. It is not what I had hoped for. I was using the vidallia chopper in the past and was hoping this would be better. When you push down the whole bottom comes up and I actually tape it down!! Works great when taped but will probably go back to the other tyoe on my next purchase.
2,unneccesary and useless,The cliff notes are useless with this book. Poorly done. A waste of $ The book isn't hard to understand and follow. The cliff notes try really hard to make it some great literature - it's not.
2,This Book Needed Help,"""The Things They Carried."" This book has many sides to it. In one moment there is love, happiness, and serenity then moments later the reality of war flips the story! The story line is so messed up on so many levels. There is a fine line between the truth of the matter and O'Briens imagination.This book has so much pain and heartache. With a mix of passion for other men at war. Even through all the deaths and destruction, these soldiers seem to taunt life with life and death games. If you were at war wouldn't you think that you would be making sure you wouldn't die!For war this book sure seems to let you know how it really was. The most important thing was that it had a historical value. At least he was there to be able to tell about it.At the beginging this book did not start at all right. Then since he was so unhappy that he did not experience a life changing effect, he focused on the negative outlook. O'Brien should have been happy he survived the Vietnam War."
4,Almost right on,I play guitar and keyboards. This book is pretty much right on the way Billy Joel does it.The only book I found a little better was Billy Joel Note by Note
3,Mixed results,"I haven't seen a mouse in the rooms that I keep this in, but I have caught 2 mice in the last month in an adjacent utility closet... I think it's working for the rooms that they are in.. Like the description says, it doesn't go through walls."
1,Black & Decker EX720-D6 Ultrasonic Pest Repeller,I don't think this product works - I installed 2 of them and my rooms are not that big. I saw a mouse even after that. I think I will have to engage professional pest control. If you are buying to control rodents don't bother to waste yr money.
2,unreliable w/high-cost of ownership in heavy-duty environmnt,"We'll give the unit two stars instead of one, since when it does work, it works well, with nice print-outs.But in a span of two+ years, its has needed its drum replaced three times. And has once needed the main system/circuit board replaced. We'd purchased this back when it cost about $125 more than it does now. And the parts have not been quickly available from some vendors. We should have bought the heavier-duty Brother 4750 which we use in another office, and has been flawless."
2,Item & Seller,"The fax machine as Brother manufactures them are really good machines but the seller from which this particular machine was purchased is most decidedly guilty of false advertising as it was advertised as being in very good condition & refurbished. In actuality of the 4 paper trays, 2 top 2 bottom, 3 were missing and the 4th was broken and missing the broken parts. It faxes and copies OK but some of the electronic functions are not acurate, having just installed a new toner cartridge it still reads change drum soon, indicating it is low on toner. I would highly recommend Brother IntelliFAX but, in the same light, highly recommend not buying from the seller this machine came from. In the past I have always had good reviews of items purchased through Amazon.com but it is inevitable that there will be a rotten apple in the bunch in regards to the people who seek to sell via Amazon.com, surely Amazon.com will weed out the rotten apple I bought from."
1,Toner Hog,"This is not a bad machine, as far as sending and receiving faxes quickly and clearly. But we've had the machine in our small office (one of 3 faxes in a 13-person law firm) for six months now, and we've already spent as much in toner as we have on the machine itself. You'll need a new toner cartridge...every 2 months if you print 50 pages a day. At that same rate, you'll also need a new toner drum...every six-eight months. Outrageous."
1,Distinctive Ring doesn't work,"I bought this fax machine today and set in up according to instructions. I have a phone number set up with distinctive ring on a line I share between both voice and fax calls. Unfortunately, the fax will not answer the distinctive ring. It is the most common ring pattern and the programming is correct, but it still doesn't work.When I called Brother's Technical Support, they explained that distinctive ring will not work if the phone line is longer than the 4.5 foot cord they supplied. In fact they require that you use their phone cord. This seems bogus in view of the fact that my old Canon faxphone worked fine with distinctive ring for the last three years. When I hooked up the 2800 directly to my wall jack using their cord, it still didn't work. They had no explanation, so it is being returned tomorrow.This may be a great fax machine, but if a basic feature like distinctive ring doesn't work, one has to wonder how the rest of the machine will hold up?"
3,Worked Great --- for a while,"We have had our 2800 for about a year and a half now. For about the first 9 months of light use, it worked just great. Nice copies, faxes were fine. Then white lines showed up on every copy or fax, and nothing the manual recommended got rid of them. We put up with lousy copies for about six months now,and I just recently learned from calling tech support that the white lines are from a worn out drum. Replacing the drum turns out to cost MORE than the price of a new unit (go figure). I also learned that the drums are only designed to last a year at most. So... if you want a disposable fax machine that you throw out after a year, get this one. If not, forget it."
2,One page at a time works great,"I've had many fax machines and this one, when it worked, certainly wasn't the worst of the bunch. Problem is, the auto document feed tray is cheesy. No matter how many times I smoothed, then fanned the paper, it would accept two to five sheets at a time. If I fed one at a time, this unit worked like a champ. Unfortunately, that can be said of most units. I've had good Brother machines in the past, and probably will buy another, better, Brother fax. This one got me so frustrated I threw it out the back door. It's still laying there, only there seems to be more pieces now."
2,picture is misleading,Thought I was getting the copy pictured - I did not see it had a red cover til it came and then I went back and read it in description - very disappointed in purchase book
3,"Works as advertised, but way overpriced","I use this rain sensor with a Rainbird controller to curtail irrigation in our small garden in CO. It works well, but the asking price of over $50 USD is somewhat ridiculous for what this is. Essentially, this is a plastic bin with two metal leads that, when water fills the bin to the level of the leads, shuts the irrigation system off. If you own a Rainbird system, you can accomplish this same task with two wires in a small cup.I know that there is something to be said for the packaging of the sensor, but I recall this item being much cheaper when I purchased it about 8-10 years ago (I think on the order of $15). I am setting up a new irrigation system of my own design and was planning to use this sensor until I saw the current asking price. I'll make my own, for much less."
1,Not Reliable and Over Priced,"Had one of these and it failed after just a few years. Contrary to what another reviewer stated, it is not just two screws sticking out. There is a printed circuit board inside with electronic components. That's where the problem is. The board has zero protection from the elements and from bugs. Mine literally had bugs crawling inside and the board was corroded.A much more reliable and less expenseive option is the Orbit unit. This is strictly electro-mechanical with little fiber washers that expand when they get wet and push on a switch contact.I would stay away from any system (water shutoff, light timer, you name it) that mounts outside the house and contains electronics that are not fully encapsulated or sealed."
5,Does what I want it to do,I have purchased several of the over the years as part of an invention of mine. They work well.
5,Best Band outta Philly,"If you're not from Philadelphia, you probably don't know the Nodd. If you're starting to hear about the Nodd, you don't know the whole story. Front-man has been with the Nodd since the beginning and is currently releasing ""Baby's First Wars"", but some of his best songs are on this CD done with the original members.They're called The Nodd because it's exactly the type of music you want playing at a bar when you want to sit and listen to music that you can nod your head to. It's the most perfect Bar-Rock band I've ever heard."
5,GREAT COMEDY,"This Comedy Is Great, Mickey Rooney Is A Treasure That Has Been Overlooked For So Long It's Pathetic,This Guy Deserves The Success That He Has Been Blessed With."
3,"Not bad, but not the best.","(...) If you're interested in shooting and editing fictional stories using iMovie, Smith's book is very useful--even though it's outdated (it covers iMovie1, not 2). What I appreciated about the book is that Smith takes digital editing seriously. He explains, somewhat, the art of it, which is evident in both the book and the attached DVD.This book, however, would be a waste of money for those seeking to shoot home, small business, or community outreach videos. If you're shooting and editing for these reasons, I highly recommend David Pogue's ""iMovie 2,"" Rory O'Neill and Eden Muir's ""Movie Making with iMovie,"" or Todd Stauffer's iMovie 2 for Dummies""--the latter includes a good CD Rom with Quicktime movie examples of the strategies and techniques explained in Stauffer's book. Stauffer also goes into advance video editing techniques not clearly explained in Neill or Smith's book.(...)"
2,Early Dawn Art,"I had planned to use this as a center piece over the front or our queen bed on the wall, but it was extremely dark. It was depressing. I had hoped the color would be lighter in order to make the room more pleasant. I thought it came with a frame, but it did not. I priced a custom made frame, but it was over $100.00, so I was not able to use this art piece at all and lost my money on it.I won't trust your colors for art orders again."
3,cute but cheap,"Really like the design of this necklace, but the chain is very cheap material and will corrode quickly and look tacky. I wish they made a silver version of this design."
2,Crammed but not very clear!!,"This DVD is full of good ideas. Unfortunately, the ideas are presented with minimum explanation as if the DVD is a review for a long training camp. The novice will miss almost all, and the mature martial artist does not need to see this DVD. In other words, it is really a waste of money. I have seen a lot better instructions offered by the Grazie brothers or by Dan Gable. So my expectations were to see a coach drilling you in the art of execution of moves and the potential pitfalls you can make!! I found none."
4,You either love it or hate it!,"We play this game as a family, and either my husband or I set it up. The plastic rods are fine, but if my five year old got a hold of them they would be snapped in half almost instantly. IF you decide to buy this toy be prepared: an adult or older child will have to set it up. Putting in the rods takes time and patience. Also, be vigilant with the pieces-- they are not meant for younger children because of the choking hazzard (the marbles) and the frustration level of setting up the game. Great for family night fun, but not good if you're hoping the kids will play quietly for a while while you get something else done!"
1,DON'T buy this!,I bought this toy for my five year-old because I saw it recommended in one of the parenting magazines. It is loud and obnoxious. Sometimes it just makes noise for no reason. It falls apart easily. Save your money for something else!
3,Too hard,"Preparing to play this game is too hard. Putting the little sticks in one hole and out the other is difficult for an adult, impossible for a 5 year old. So don't buy this toy for your child unless you want to be called on to set it up every time."
4,Fun Game,"The game is entertaining and the sounds add to the fun. It takes a bit of time to set up the game, but overall a great game."
1,This book is absolute rubbish!,"I was exicited when I received this book, as it looked like it was full of useful information. Upon closer inspection, I found an astonishing amount of typos and misplaced information. Also, the author draws her patterns with seam allowances, which makes initially fitting the pieces together distracting, given the vague measurements she provides. She tells the reader incorrect information about the quantities of fabric to cut. She gives the reader poor information about how to cut a facing pattern. I'm surprised she found a publisher for this rubbish! I have done more research on this subject and it was recommended to me by experienced corset makers to stay away from this useless book and to get Jean Hunnisett's Period Costumes for Stage and Screen, 1500-1800. In fact, all of her books are much more thorough and better thought out."
1,disappointing,"""The Little Corset Book: A Workbook on Period Underwear"" was a bit disappointing for me as I expected something more informative. The book was very simple and resembled a children's book. I would recommend it only to those who have never made a corset before. Even then it lacks information."
3,A good overview,"This is a good overview of corset building. But be clear - this is truly and ""little"" book. It's really a glorified pamphlet. It has very nice, concise building instructions for a few corset designs. There is some ""different"" stuff in here that I haven't found elsewhere. For example a nice way to create a finished looking one-layer corset. Also, she explains how to sew in a waist tape without the seams showing on the exterior. There are some finishing suggestions in there too. I think it's a good companion book or a resource for a more accomplished sewer looking to get into corsets (ie. someone who does not need much detailed guidance)."
3,I feel short-changed.,"I can understand Koren's feelings of alienation, and I was with her for the first hundred or so pages. But then, as each chapter began I couldn't believe she was still in college and narrating the same old stories to us. I got it already.Then suddenly, her story was over, way too quickly. I feel cheated and short-changed. How did she fix herself so fast? I stayed with her to hear all the sordid details of her binges; where is the payoff?And I'm assuming she fixed herself, because she gives us no other explanation; did she see a counselor? A therapist? Did she ever try AA again? I have no idea.A bad night out with her boyfriend, a bit of online research, an email from a counselor, and suddenly she has the resolve to change her life this drastically?I think she does the reader a disservice by not fleshing out the recovery process ."
1,Impossible to read & takes no responsibility,"I found this book almost impossible to read. The author tries to tell us that although drinking almost ruined her life she is in no way physically addicted to booze so therefore not an alcoholic. This is beyond disturbing. Does she have any idea what bull she is selling other twenty-somethings? Basically she is saying ""It's fine to drink from 14-24 and then don't worry you can get your stuff together then."" Again, I believe this is total bull. She can't remember having sex and blacks out repeatedly but isn't a drunk? Yeah right. Maybe she should look up the definition. The most disturbing thing was her complete lack of personal responsibility.Shame on her publisher for thinking this was ok to print.If you want to read a book on drinking read: Drinking- A Love Story by Carolyn Knapp."
1,Not an Alchoholic? Are you kidding me?,"I have a serious problem with this book. Ms Zailckas refuses to declare that she's an alcholic. Are you kidding me? If it looks like a fish, drinks like a fish, then it must be...The book is well written and interesting, but I think it could be more honest."
2,Good Story; Poor Writing,"I've been reading a lot of memoirs lately and this was frankly, my most disappointing read in a long time. The author has a great story to tell, and she weaves in statistics in an interesting way, but I found it hard to get past the very poor writing.There is never an opening hook to draw one in, and the lackluster writing leaves the book feeling more like a bland catalogue of events than artful storytelling. The author has a lot of trouble with tenses, and at times she attempts metaphors using cultural references that wouldn't have been known at the time (and in the tense) she is making them. It was very distracting and I actually gave myself a headache as I struggled to finish this book.If you're looking for a similar story with better writing I'd suggest Caroline Knapp's engaging ""Drinking: A Love Story,"" which, like this book, hits on issues of gender and alcolohism/addiction in the form of personal memoir - but in a much more readable way."
4,shockingly hit home,"When I first picked up the book I thought it was fiction. I got into bed and at first was disappointed to find out it was not. However I decided to give it a chance. I was hooked right away. My breath was stolen while I connected to the writer. At my age now I look at my adolescence and young adulthood as if it was someone else but while reading that book it brought back so much emotion. I encouraged my friends and sister to read it because I felt we all could relate and everyone has loved this book. The stories may be shocking, sad, and/or appalling but it happens. It is very real."
2,Not sure about her tone,Good writing but the author seems to be blaming alcohol for all her problems and generalizing to the extent that this happens to ALL 'teenage girls' while in fact most can just handle their liquor a hell of a lot better than her.
5,Concerned,"The book is well written. I keep asking myself what made the author so self-destructive, self-centered, and willing to hurt her family and friends. What can we learn from her? What can parents do to help their children become responsible and self-confident so that they do not go in this direction? Was her problem physical and beyond her control? Was she angry at everyone and especially herself? She seemed to come from a loving family and was given the opportunity to attend college, which is not the case for many young people? Why didn't she value this and spend her time learning and growing? While she is able to write about her feelings, she is in denial about some of her experiences."
1,A LOT OF RAMBLING,I HAVE NEVER READ A BOOK WHERE THERE IS SO MUCH SIDE TRACKING. THE AUTHOR DOES SO MUCH RAMBLING THAT I FORGOT WHERE SHE WAS GOING WITH THE STORY.
1,"She's a whiner, as well as a wino.","Zailckas spends most of her time whining about her horribly lonely childhood and her lack of self-esteem. She never really takes responsibility for becoming an alcoholic (even though she never admits she IS one) - instead she blames it on having no friends, meeting pushy ""friends"", and getting involved in the Greek system. I must have rolled my eyes a million times reading this book. Zailckas needs to realize that even though she has low self-esteem, it doesn't mean it's OK to become a substance abuser. Not worth reading, at all."
1,Worst Book On Addiction Ever!,I borrowed this book and it's the most shallow and hollow and selfishly denying book on addiction that I've ever read. If I could have given it no stars I would have.
3,kind of drawn out,"It was an ok book. It was easy to relate to Im sure for many people, but so are a lot of books. To me it seemed very drawn out and long for what it had to say."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,Koren Zailckas book Smashed is the best book ever written. I have never been a big reader untill I started this book. I had it finished within 2 nights. I absolutley love this book. My english teacher is a book maniac. She reccomnds the best books. This time I got to reccomend to my class a book that she has never read. Everyone was so intrested. I give this book 5 stars!
1,LOOK AT ME IM A DRUNK,"Self-promoting, narcissistic dribble. Author brags about not being an alcoholic yet then writes about how much of a drunk she was for a few years. How pathetic."
3,Spring Break or Bust,"Excessive drug and alcohol abuse is more endemic than ever among teenagers and college students in America. Visit Panama City, Fl. or Cancun Mexico during spring break and behold what substance abuse can do to our young. I don't think it is the lack of self esteem as portrayed by Koren Zailckas as much as peer pressures for men to join the macho club and for women to become promiscuous what brings them to the bottle.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir"
5,Great Book!!,"The way Zailckas writes makes for an extremely honest, interesting book! She writes about so many things that, as a young woman, you think about but you don't even realize it. Anyone who has suffered w/alcohol abuse themselves or because of a friend/family member, will feel a connection w/Zailckas and just about every story she tells. This has become one of my favorites!"
2,a big disappointment,"Not sure what I was expecting from this book when I bought it. Zailckas is a decent writer but no breakout prodigy. She relies on metaphors way too much to make her words interesting and impactful, when in fact they really are not. Maybe someone aged 70 or older would be shocked by her tale of ""alcohol abuse"" (Koren, face it honey you ARE an ALCOHOLIC, little miss self righteous) Her story was a watered down version of my own life and the lives of any average middle to upper class college-bound white girl. Yawn, yawn....I could write a novel based on one mardi gras or spring break I experienced that would blow her memoir away. PLEASE...."
3,Good effort,"I wanted to like this book much much more than i actually did. Zailckas has tremendous talent as a writer, but many times it was too evident that she was writing this at a young and inexperienced age. I do look forward to more from this author in the future."
4,A good read,"I purchased this book because I work at a college where I'm the person who addresses student misconduct (think of the vice-principal for a college). As a result I address many alcohol issues - some ordinary and some quite dramatic. I was hoping to gain insight into the world of college alcohol consumption through this unusual source (normally my insight comes through students, research papers etc).With that in mind, this is an enjoyable book. A thoroughly detailed dive into the world of alcohol abuse - from an early age through young adulthood. The book is quite longer than I would expect, which is generally due to the author's detailed descriptions of people, events etc. However, the book is very well written so I didn't mind the length in the least. The book has excellent pace and provides good insight into the world of alcohol abuse. I would recommend this title."
2,Please Go Away,"Can someone please stop this trend of rich-white-sorority-girl-bares-her-soul stories? Please. Am I supposed to feel sorry for this girl? Does our youth culture drink too much? Yes. Is her book an accurate account of excess in the youth community? Yes. But when she veers off into her oh-so-pained soul I want to speyack all over the cute cover. Honey, when I was 18, I was working two jobs and worrying about my working-class mother's deteriorating health and lack of health insurance. Did I get drunk with my girlfriend's? Hell yes. Did I write a book about it boo-hooing to the world that I'm not ""really"" that girl. Uh no. This girl had a safety net at every point and chose to continue being destructive and ridiculous despite loving parents, plenty of money and the opportunity to have a college education. I have a lot of resentment towards her and women like her."
1,"a moralizing, rambling yawn of a tale","As a fan of memoirs, I was intrigued by this book. But once I got 3/4 of the way through it I almost was wishing for James Frey to come along and slip in a few words of entertaining writing or at least an exciting anecdote or two.The book starts out as a diary of virtually any woman who's been to college since the mid-80s, and then ends on a schoolmarmish, prohibitionist note. Worst of all, there's no insight as to how the author got from one end of the spectrum to the other. For a better written and more insightful book, look for ""Drinking: A love story"" by Caroline Knapp."
5,Even sober people can learn something about themselves. Read,"Koren has written a beautiful story about a tragic life! As so many people have said, her way of telling the story is amazing, almost poetic. She paints such a vivid picture with her words, you see the whole story unfold before you in you mind. But more importantly, I think, is that any one can relate to the pain and insecurity she feels that lead her to drinking in the first place. That feeling of being small and insignifigent that is miraculously taken away by a few mere sips of alcahol. Any one can hide behind the booze, but it takes a brave person to come out and write as honestly as she has in this book. She writes every thing in a very matter of fact manner and appologizes for nothing, you don't feel sorry for her, you just feel her experience. I reccomend this book to anyone, it is a true eyeopener."
2,"You lost me at ""I am not an alcoholic""","This book is in dangerous territory. It goes through a textbook case, but the writer refuses to see that she is indeed, an alcoholic, and is afraid to embrace that reality. There is alot of glorification of drinking, along with the bad. She states that she is not an alcoholic, but the remainder of the book begs to differ."
1,Read? Write? Drink?,Zailckas needs to start drinking again so that she can get a true understanding of alcoholism. I found her book difficult to read; not because of content rather her perspective of alcoholism. Her assertion that she's not an alcoholic just an alcohol abuser that doesn't drink anymore is absurd. Alcohol abuser = alcoholic.
1,Self-absorbed and not well written,"I read this in conjunction with 'Blackout Girl'. Both books suffer from the same disease...that the authors think the facts of their life story are interesting in and of themselves. But they are not. Tales of dysfunctional parents and wild debauchery may make for a good hour on the Jerry Springer Show, they do not necessarily make interesting reading.The other issue is that most of the writing is cliched and trite to the point of exhaustion. It did get to the point where I could not finish this book....it no longer seemed worth the investment of time."
1,I wish I could give it less stars...,"This book starts off good and giving you a back story..but by the middle, I was ready to pull my hair out. Being in my early 20's, I can not relate to this girl what so ever! I mean, you would think if she was in that poor state and going on rampages, that someone would have had a talk with her, shipped her to rehab or something. It really makes me wonder how much is true. I wouldn't recommend this book, not only because of that, but because by the middle of it, it's REAL slow. I mean, I hardly could finish it. I had to skim pages to get through it."
4,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,"SMASHED is a chilling novel of female alcohol addiction. For Koren Zailckas, it started at age fourteen, and from her first drink of Southern Comfort she was addicted. Koren later joins a college sonority, which just gives her more of a reason to get really drunk -- and more people to do it with!The writing isn't the most brilliant that I have ever read but the story is definitely good. Most alcohol addiction books are about a male, so this is a great book to read if you want to learn about this subject -- or even if you are just a curious reader.There is not a lot that you can say about this book without giving the whole thing away! Even though she drinks excessively, Koren never goes to rehab or actually goes to an AA meeting! And unlike James Frey's embellished novel (A Million Little Pieces) of drug and alcohol addiction, this one is the truth.Reviewed by: Taylor Rector"
3,Interesting read but...,"I'm a skeptic, and as James Frey demonstrated so well, memoirs tend to be embelished. I am certain that is the case in 'Smashed'. I was convinced of this on page 30 when Koren makes reference to looking up a recipe for vodka watermelon on the internet...in 1994. The internet was not what it is today back in 1994. Unless you were a computer nerd, which she is not, you wouldn't be on the internet in 1994. And if you were, you wouldn't find a recipe for vodka watermelon."
4,A real eye opener,The author's honesty in describing the reality of female adolescent drinking is to be commended. The drinking scenes are not romanticized. Every parent and teen should read this book.
3,Defitinitely Worth the Read,I will start this review with the reasons that I only gave this book 3 stars: 1) The author at times comes off self righteous 2) The author at times comes off pretentious 3) There was not a huge difference between this book and the other books/memoirs that I have read about addiction.Despite all this it was a good read. There were enough cringe worthy moments to go around and you are really made to feel like you are standing right beside the writer (even when you want to turn away). I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13. It is a cautionary tale. When I finished reading it was a Friday night and the idea of grabbing a beer or a cocktail was out of the question.
3,Smashed II: The follow up,"I read this little diddy in about 2 days. Interesting. Sad. Confirmed much that I already knew.However..I am awaiting the follow up book from Koren...Smashed II. This will chronicle the years of her life from 23 onward...the years that happen once she picks up again, when she puts all her eggs in the basket in the form of another online test that says ""everyone else is a drunk, but you're special"" and steers her down that long path of denial-the path she has been on since the beginning.Get some help Koren, you need it. Grow up and take responsibility.Every single criteria for alcoholism is met here, by her own words. Your so called lack of genetics is questionable..who among us knows this with certainty? 'I fear this book will make a bad situation worse, for those young women who think this kind of behavior is inevitable, that you can go on to drink again as if a switch can be turned off, and is not that of an alcoholic."
2,Tediously narcissistic,"I became attracted to this book by a Readers Digest exerpt. The exerpted part was about Koren's ""almost death"" in high school. I was fascinated and raced to the library to get it. I was deeply disappointed. Koren takes no responsibility for her own actions, she blames everything and everyone but herself for her drinking. I do blame her parents, they seem to have ignored her issues which were clearly so evident. Where the heck were they? I don't really care if she's an alcohol abuser or an alcoholic, but she isn't dealing with her issues and is probably going to fall back either into drinking or some other self-destructive habit. It's not a particularly well-written book, content aside. The four-letter words are annoying. I personally think that people use them as filler when they don't have much of substance to say."
3,"Good, quick read","I really liked this book, but I had trouble with the author's denial of her alcoholism. Her loss of control with alcohol indicates something well beyond ""problem drinking."" I am glad she chose to stop drinking and put an end to her self-destructive patterns. I fear for her, however, because in not admitting to her disease, she is leaving the door open for a serious relapse. I wish her the best, though, and admire her wisdom at such a young age. I also appreciate her view that alcohol is a drug, and should not be considered less harmful than other abused substances."
2,Flat,"I really wanted to love this book. As a gal who was a teenage alcoholic, I thought that it would hit home. In a way it did, but Koren lost me along the way. She didn't dive right in and she didn't plunge right out. Her story reminded me of a beer that's gone flat. I suppose it's her personality in general, but I was dissapointed in general. She chickened out. She didn't get to the heart, which I believe would have made this story a hell of a lot better."
2,I just didn't like the book.,I just was not impressed with it. I'm sorry if you do like this book. I am a guy and maybe that is why I did not like it that much. This book just was not for me.
5,Good read.,"Early in the book I was annoyed with Koren for the choices she made to get deliberately drunk. Nevertheless, I found the book to be a good and quick read. Koren is an excellent writer who uses our langurage in a creative and unusual way."
1,Full of Painful Cliches,"I'm still trying to figure out what this book is supposed to be about. The message I got was that the author is simply not worth being around until she's got a few drinks poured down her throat. Certainly that's the only way she'd be remotely tollerable. She whines for page after page and uses the word verdant way too many times. It's too easy to blame substance abuse for your problems when you need to get some professional help and admit that you've got some issues.One of my favorite sayings from my college days was ""I'm a drunk, alcoholics go to meetings."" The author needs to get over herself, go to treatment, and quit spewing her ""Poor Me"" story on unsuspecting readers.I'm not ashamed to say that I took this book back to the store and returned it."
5,Amazing.,"This memoir is about Koren Zailckas' drunken teen years and how she later became sober and felt isolated and confused, as if she hadn't grown up in the time she was prepetually drunk. If you've ever drank or done any type of drugs, I think you can relate to her feelings towards the issues surrounding them.I absolutely adored this book. I could relate to some of what Koren was saying and when I couldn't, she painted the picture so detailed that I empathized with her completely. I hope Koren writes another book, because this one is an amazing read that I will definitely read again and again (I don't do that often)."
2,14? Really?,"As much as I admire Koren for telling her story, I have to look back to when I was 14 and try to remember if I felt anything remotely like she did. And I came to the conclusion that I didn't have any of those feelings or thoughts that she claims to have had at that age. It just seems a little too deep for someone who was 14 at the time. At her current age, sure, or even late teens, but at 14? It just makes the book hard to accept at face value."
2,Didn't care for certain apects,"I think her descriptions of events are very realistic - but I think the auther has no realistic handle on herself or her situation. I read it all, but walked away annoyed."
2,So Generation Y thinks they invented partying?,"Zailckas's college experience and high school experience are pretty tame compared to mine and many I grew up with. I can't help but laugh when I read a 43 year old mom's review about how shocked she was to discover what really happens at college and in high school. This behavior has been going on since I was in high school in the late 80's-we just kept quiet about it. This book became pretty boring half way through and I feel sorry that such a pretty, talented young woman lacked so much self esteem.Seriously though, I'm glad she sobered up, but nothing this girl did was really shocking. Yeah, I'm definitely going to write a memoir about my teens and early 20's-MUCH more riveting I assure you..."
4,A nice fun toy.,"This game was given to us as a gift and my 5 and 3 year old love it!!!! I do have to help them, but we have tons of fun."
5,"Silly KITTY, as in Dish",If you have a 'wacky' feline in your life...this dish is for them. It's a Purrr-fect gift for someone who 'purrs'.It arrived REAL QUICK to my doorstep and in Purrrr-fect condition. Great seller.
4,Gorgeous!,"We were unsure about this item, but it's much cuter in person and a brighter yellow than it looks here. Perfect pet bowl! Also a nice size - not too big and not too small."
2,cat's don't like the bowl,"Due to the bowl's oval shape, my cats do not like it so I stopped using it for them and now use it as a side bowl dish for myself."
3,"Worked great, but found cheaper in Home Depot","I used this to mount a very large ceiling fan. Once I revceived it and knew what the box looked like, it caught my eye in Home Depot a couple weeks later for almost half the price."
1,"Doesn't work with 3/4"" drywall","From step 1: ""Feet are preset for 1/2"" sheetrock, be sure that the box will be flush with the finished ceiling.""The distance from the bottom of the bar to the bottom of the 2x4 is 1"", and the box is 1.5"", so it works, if your drywall is 1/2"" thick. If your drywall is 3/4"" of an inch thick, then you would need to add a 1/4"" thick board or something between the box and the bar (don't know if that's a good idea, the instructions say nothing about what to do if your drywall isn't 1/2"" thick.)There is nothing in the product description or the outer box stating you need 1/2"" sheetrock, so I'm giving this 1 star.Also, it only comes with one wire ""clamp"", you might need three."
4,"You're right, Sasha.",Dalida could sing anything and sound great. However she coud do without at least 50 of them. Not exactly her style.I still admire her even 21 years after she passed away.
2,Mosquito Breeder,"Why would anyone design a hose pot with absolutely no drainage in the bottom??? Beats me!! You can't turn it over to empty it out once the 50 or more feet of hose is in it. Only thing to do is get out your drill and put in your own holes. Also a lot of money for a piece of plastic. Not bad enough for me to repack and return, but would not buy again."
4,a little pricey,"my mom asked for something like this for moms day, and this was the only one i could find in stores or on internet ...i thought it was a little lightweight for such high price, but maybe it'll last forever... mom loves it !"
2,very lightweight,"These work but you'll have to drill holes in them to let out rainwater. The material is not very heavy, so pulling the hose out sometimes takes the entire contraption along with you. I'd prefer heavier-gauge plastic or better yet, ceramic."
3,A little light weight.,Would prefer is the plastic was a bit thicker. Too cold today to put it outside. Rim needs to be a little thicker.;
5,Production Control Desk Book,"In this day an age of electronic workstations, it is hard to find a book that describes the basics. This book shows how it can be done with paper. So when the lights go out you can still move forward. This book has plenty of work flow diagrams and sample reports, and an extensive index.Robert L. Janson was a manager with Ernst and Ernst Cleveland, Ohio. Previously to that, he was works manager of Otis Elevator's Baker Fort Lift Truck Division, where he was responsible for all plant operations.I know this book works as it was the key basis that I used at Keen Wire Company to run the production control. We took a unique approach by building a ""war room"" with Plexiglas walls and moved the products and machines around with grease pencils and shop rags. You could see the whole operation at a glance, not just looking at a fraction in a small computer window."
2,one god song,"it's a waste of money. There is one god song, ok maybe two, but everything else is just not good enought"
3,Not the best of the collection,"In my advice, vol. 6 is not as good as the others. Some pieces are boring. Not my best buy."
5,Rightfully named!,"This release is a Holy Spirit-driven project. Twinkie's skills and gifts shine. A 'soul food' treat hearing Donald Lawrence's background voicing and keyboards by Ben Tankard. Hard to pick a favorite. I and family members are taken to a place of worship when I play this one. It is a must-have for praise and worship collectors, and a gem to anyone's 'prayer-closet' library."
5,As the Title of the CD states.......,"The CD title says it all!! There is nothing I can say about this CD, except for ""Extraordinary and Annoited!"" Twinkie Clark has the kind talent that you only get to witness once in a lifetime. And, I do mean this. She is incredible. This solo album captures the essence of remarkable gospel music and musicality. She can make a Harmon Organ (Big classic organs, with the gigantic stove pipes!) SING!! If you looking for a healing....if you looking to be saved...or get on a journey to know God, start here! Nothing like one of the Clark sisters to help you revive your life! Add this CD to your collection...but be aware that you will be on a experience a revival in your life....and will opt buy her other CDs!"
1,ITS ALL RIGHT,THIS IS MY FIRST CD THAT I BOUGHT FROM TWINKIE AND I MUST SAY THAT ITS REALLY ALL THAT GREAT ITS OK BUT ITS NOT AWESOME LIKE HER OTHERS CD ARE. TRUST ME I LISTEN TO A LOT OF GOSPEL MUSIC AND THIS CD IS NOT GOOD. SO SAVE YOUR MONEY
4,Presto ProFry,"I love it! Easy clean up, small enough to store and large enough to feed many. Used it for Fries Chicken Super Bowl party and was fantastic. Tempura is great tooI recommend it."
2,No-show No-go,"Promising but uncomfortable brief. 100% cotton loses its shape in the legs after wearing all day and shrinks on washing. Would be better as a blend of cotton / spandex (96%/4% ratio) to keep the shape in the legs and give a little. Also would be more comfortable with more pouch area. As an average sized man, they feel like they were made for little boys. Very tight especially after washing. Won't buy it again."
1,Vise Like,"These are great the first day you get them but beware, you wash them and they turn into nut crunchers. Shrink like there is no tomorrow. I can not even wear them anymore. They squeeze your package until you want to cry. I use them for rags now. Expensive rags."
3,Fixes sound degredation,"For those of you who don't think you need a switcher, you must just have one or two systems connected to your VCR or TV.Certainly a person can use those handy three-dollar y-connectors from any electronics store, however after your third console purchase it would have been just as cost effective to get a switch box. Especially once you daisy chain too many y-connectors and systems sound degredation occurs and you have to turn up the volume much higher than you would normally need to.For those gamers with two stereo capable consoles, don't get something like this... it's once you get that third console that y-connectors are no longer cost-effective plus they degrade sound quality. For those gamers planning on owning more than two consoles in their future, one might as well spend a little extra money now to improve sound quality later."
5,Beautiful and powerful,"The beauty and power of Gospel music is that it will meet you where you are. For example, I have listened to this c.d. a dozen times but last week I heard it for the first time. My personal situation has changed and the ministry of The Canton Spirituals met me where I am. That is the beauty and that is the power of GOSPEL music in general and The Canton Spirituals specifically. This is why you must purchase, not rent or borrow this c.d. You'll need it handy, late in the mid-night hour. Heaven IS looking down on us all and I especially felt the presence of the LORD during GOD LOVES YOU. Please purchase this c.d. and keep it handy. It is both beautiful and powerful."
5,items,It doesnt skip or nothing i love ordering off this site in fact this is were i order anything i need now awesome.
5,DYNOMITE,"HARVEY AND THE GUYS ARE SIMPLY AWESOME. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CD YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT. I DROVE FROM NASHVILLE TO DAYTON, OH WITH THIS CD PLAYING AND I PROMISE...I WAS ROLLING AND PRAISING GOD ALL THE WAY. GOD HAS RICHLY BLESSED THEM AND THEY PUT ON A GOOD STAGE PERFORMANCE TOO!!!!!!!! MY PERSONAL FAVORITES ON THE CD? UH...#1,#2, #3, #4 ETC......."
4,Really cool,"I never thought a long sleeve shirt would be cooler than a short sleeve. And I mean temperature as well as hip. The vented back and underarms let the breeze through. I need to protect my arms from the sun. I also use this when videotaping on location. My video production website is [...] The pockets are aplenty and ample sizes. The Velcro makes me feel secure enough to put cell phone and even wallet in the pockets.The only downside is that it needs cold water washing. My laundry service washes is separately and they don't add starch. So the shirt, even with their pressing, does not look crisp. The seller even delivers it wrinkled."
5,100% Recomendada,"Esta camisa es exelente, fresca y de un diseño muy moderno y unico, caracteristico de esta buena marca como lo es Columbia."
2,opinion,"esta muy bonita pero hay que especificar mejor la talla por que yo soy "" L "" y m la enviaron "" LT "" y me queda muy grande pero es de buena calidad"
5,Brilliant,"From Pennywise comes this release inspired by the protests against the WTO. The album is highly political, although the slogans have been heard before and are as such not very original, but then again it does not have to be. Pennywise got a rather radical approach to their subject, just listen to songs like F*ck Authority or Time Marches On. The music is fast and furious leaving no doubt in ones mind about the anger and desperation it expresses. This is truly a great album, whether or not you agree with the political statements made in the songs."
3,Good lyrics- but only decent music,"Pennywise has a good message, and a lot of the lyrics on this cd are quite good, very smart anarchist type lyrics similar to those of old-school hardcore bands. But the music grows a bit tiresome after a bit. But its good that the idead are getting to a larger audience than truly great bands like DK, Subuhmans, and Crass did during their time. The best songs are WTO, Land of the Free?, and My God. This is a good listen, but if you want better Pennywise, pick up 'About Time,' when Pennywise sounded truly fresh."
5,Probably one of the Best Pennywise Albums,"This album has to be the best Pennywise album. The feel is total different from most Pennywise albums. I should know having A Word to the Wise, Pennywise, About Time, Full Circle, Straight Ahead, Live @ the Key Club and Land of the Free? The Bass is extraordinary and the path of the album had to have been set by the songs Fight 'Til You Die and My Own Country. This is a must for any Pennywise fan."
3,A mediocre and redundant effort.,"Okay I'm no big fan of punk now, but I used to be and Pennywise always sounded the same from album to album, and then I got this CD and still they haven't changed much. Sure they've got the whole politically charged in-your-face type of music, but it gets really really tired fast. I think they need somebody with different vocals to replace or add, because he always sounds the same and that is one reason why it's so repetitive sounding. This is an okay album, with the good songs being fudge Authority, The World, and My God. If you like Blink 182 or Bad Religion then this CD is for you, but for me, no."
5,GET ON YOUR KNEES AND PRAY,"i dont know how anyone can critize this album, i have been into punk for about a year know and this is one of my favorite cds, yea its repedative, and alot of the songs sound the same, but i like they way they sound, so i like all the songs. This cd gets you pumped and makes you wanna go to your friendly police officer and punch him in the face."
3,Going the wrong way,"Let me first say that Pennywise is one of my favorite bands. I anticipated the release of this album, and hoped that they would return to a sound similar to Full Circle/About Time. Unfortunutely they strayed the oppisite direction. The LOTF has a deeper, slower more rock sound that seems to be more KROQ material than punk. Its still a solid record, but not what a pennywise fan is looking for."
5,Delivers From Beginning to End,"This is one of those rare albums that contains no fillers. If you want to listen to a CD that packs a punch from beginning to end, this is a must have. I have been a punk rock fan from the early days & had the pleasure of being totally immersed in the Lower East Side of NYC scene in the late 70's & early 80's. This albums harkens back to the days of early Ramones, The Clash, & Sex Pistols. Angry driving music with a social commentary - that's what punk rock has always been all about & this one won't disappoint. The production quality is right on - no over producing or special effects. Hard pounding rhythm section, powerful guitar, & easy to understand vocals that carry a message."
4,gooses review,"Ive only heard one other pennywise cd and it seemed a lot like this one except not as good. This cd is very politically motivated and fun to listen to. Some of their songs seem to be highly repetitive such as enemy and my god. The best song on here in my opinion is the world. f**k authority, something wrong with me, and its up to you are really good too. A lot of what is on this cd is contemporary history and in a couple of decades will earn a couple of paragraphs in all our childrens history books making this a small peice of american history."
3,ok,"pennywise is one of the only underground punk today, but its not good. get a Dead Kennedys album now."
3,Repeating Repeatedly,"When I bought Land of the Free, I was desperately hoping that it would offer some variety from the usual Pennywise sound. Me and my friends always joked about how if you took out the lyrics, the songs would be unidentifiable in most PW albums but now it's getting ridiculous. I think About Time is their best album and seeing as how they haven't progressed much at all, why not jus' save your money and put the CD player on repeat with that one LP? I can see Land of the Free being a great concert CD though, and I hope to have that confirmed when I see'em at Warped."
2,Pennysame,When I purchased this album I expected much more. I was looking for some fresh punk music and ended up wasting [price] on an the album. 2 or 3 songs are decent but the rest is worthless. Some of the songs contradict themselves with their lyrics and it is annoying. If you care about substance then you won't purchase this cd.
1,(...worst ever by Pennywise),"Well I am going to be short with this. This is a horrible album, worst ever by Pennywise. It seems like they saw Anti Flag gaining popularity and jumped on the bandwagon. It's bad enough to have one Anti Flag, but two...no."
2,"Pretty mediocre ""modern punk""...","With this record Pennywise truly solidifies their place in the modern punk scene... as one of the most boring bands around.Musically, it's very standard Pennywise. Nothing new or exciting about them, as they comform to the same formula they've been using over and over and over again. Lyrically, it comes off as something written by an angry 10 year old. There's not a trace of intelligence or true feeling to be found.Pennywise isn't one of those bands that used to be really good and have grown stale (The Offspring)... because Pennywise were never good to begin with. They started out as young Bad Religion wannabes and evolved into... well... older Bad Religion wannabes.If you want true socially conscious punk rock, there's a million other bands more worthy than Pennywise. Seriously."
5,Now this is my kinda music,"I've heard about VS because they are managed by Simon Webbe's record label. I had already heard ""Love you like Mad"" it kind of has a slow jam vibe to it with solid vocals and raps by the group. There are 5 members in the group 2 girls & 3 guys. Having heard the song, i thought i like where this group is headed. I decided to wait awhile and see what comes after. So i heard ""Make It Hot"" awhile ago and decided that since i enjoyed both songs. I would give the CD a shot and i'm glad that i did. This one is all about the R&B; jams uptempo, midtempo and all that. ""All Kinds of Trouble"" does it right where it matters the most. It gets you into a dancing clubbing type mood then takes you on a trip in a different way.I'm looking to hear more from this group cause they have no where to go but up from here. Its just my opinion but its based on the fact that i've listened to this cd several times. VS is in there for sure. Check it out!!"
5,Another great Global product!,"I can't see anyone who is not already a fan of Global knives spending this kind of money on a spatula. It is high quality, but I never would have spent this kind of money on a spatula if it weren't solely just for the sake of matching my global knives. It is a little bit of a light-weight spatula, but it looks great!"
4,Not as good as a tube HDTY,In HD this TV is as good as the Samsung Tube Widescreen HD TV that I had.But when your watching a non HD program it does not compare to a tube HD TV.Its just that the tube TV weights a ton is why I bought this LCD HD TV.
5,Great Value,"I am very impressed with this TV. It looks great and it is easy to hook up almost any device to it. I have no complaints at all. Oh there is one thing. The remote is a bit cheesy and sometimes you have to press it ""just right"" to get it to work. I still give this TV 5 stars"
2,Don't buy this TV,"I bought this TV from CompUSA in November. It died in December. CompUSA said too bad, I had to go thru manufacture. They gave me a number that was disconected. I finally got in touch the Manufacture. They said I had to give them a credit card in case I did not return the old TV. They said the card would only be charged if the tv was not returned. My wife found that they had charged our credit card $1800 even though the TV had not been sent out yet. Most companies at least facilitate customers with problems. CompUSA never returned any of the ten phone messages that I left. This included the Regional Manager and the Store Manager."
1,Screen busted within 18 months - TV now totally useless,"I bought the Olevia 30"" through Amazon back in March 2005 (at a cost of $1150 plus delivery at the time) ... a few days ago - Saturday July 29 2006, the screen suddenly went black and the TV died - the sound still worked but no vision. I had a TV expert friend look at it yesterday - and he said that it has gone for good ...Lasted less than 18 months --- so much for the 12 month warranty.My recommendation - stay away from Ovelia ... majorly disappointed - and have to falk out $800 for a replacement ...."
5,Outstanding Widesreen HD-Ready LCD TV,I purchased this TV at ABC Wharehouse for $1149.00 before $150.00 Rebate and 6% Tax. Total price appx. $1168.00. Sale ends today 6/18.This TV is a steal for this price. I agree with all the 5 Star reviews.
2,"Disjointed storyline, unsympathetic characters","The Woodsman's Daughter reads as if the author wrote three separate stories years apart, and then tried to bind them together with Elmer's glue. The first part, which deals with a stereotypical drunken Southern father (please! can we get any more banal?) and his family, is mildly interesting. The second part focuses on the surviving daughter, Dalia, left penniless, who determines to marry for money and of course, ends up well-off but with an abusive husband. The third part highlights Dalia's daughter, who turns into a rebellious ""flapper"" and outrages her mother completely. Through a totally Gothic turn of morbid events, most lives get ruined in the end. Not recommended unless it's the only book at the vacation condo. Stick with Anne Rivers Siddons for better-written versions of the same story."
1,Hack Ick - I'm Melting,"This was the worst book I've ever read. Although the book is incredibly descriptive and elicits a highly visual experience, the subject matter is demented and verges on something sadly insane. The author wrote as if she were bored and needed to add sick events to dramatize an otherwise quaint country story. The setting is realistic and the characters are believable. Somehow it didnt help that they were thrown together, and just when you think the story will get better (or at least less disgusting), it DOESNT."
2,natural product for erectile dysfunction,ASP for Men (Amazon)There is little to review; there are no apparent side effects; there is no effect as advertised. (dose doubling has no effect; daily use has no effect
1,Save Your Money,"Don't be suckered into buying ASP, it does not work and your just throwing your money away. Do not know a substitute for this but maybe you'd be better off seeking help from a doctor. I threw mine away - adios dollars."
3,Good but quick!,"Good text of differential equations, though I found it to run quickly and obscurly through certain concepts. Otherwise, most topics were explored thouroughly and often nice little tricks were given to make your life easier!"
1,Vedic Mathematics for Schools,"Simply a waste of time. Yes they are a very clever series of tricks to do arithmetic in your head, but with numerous exceptions and caveats. A bright student may look at these with some interest to see why they work, but for the vast majority of students there is no value in more rules to be learnt and certainly no understanding of basic maths to be gained."
3,Okay,"This book was sort of okay, but I found VEDIC MATHEMATICS, based on the 16 vedic sutras more interesting than this."
5,"John Burton is the ""Godfather"" of Modern Creative Lampwork",I love this book! It was the first modern book on creative lampworking. Includes lots of funky little weird-looking glassworks; but the techniques (including making your own colors) are all here.
4,"Great story, easy to understand and colorful pictures","My 3 year old enjoyed this book very much. It shows the difference between some of the zoo animals and humans. She knows now that penguins have webbed feet and wings, etc. We enjoyed reading it and enjoyed the colorful pictures."

1,"""The Worst Low Budget Film Ever""","""Do not buy this movie, I repeat, do not buy this movie."" This is suppose to be a low budget horror, about three killers who like to cause chaos against whoever they come across. They come across a family, that has a sick relative with the power, to bring back the dead to seek revenge on those who hurt her family. The acting is really horrible, and it's really amateur. It's such a waste of money. I was psyched by the cover, and the little story about the movie, but it's not what it seems, save your money."
1,Gee The Cover Looks Good,"You know how you sometimes buy a movie because you think the cover looks promising, well that's the mistake I made with this bit of low budget trash, now don't you go making the same error.Aunt Rose is garbage, nice cover though."
1,Low budget? Try NO budget...,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. A whole lot of talk and very little action. I love cheesy horor films, but this absolutely sucked.Joshua Nelson is hot, but there are no scenes with him so much as shirtless, so there is no point whatsoever to seeing this film. And what kind of name is Velocity Chyaldd? Jeez..."
2,Bored out of my mind!,"From the reviews, this workout seemed great. However, it's possibly the most boring video that I've tried. Of perhaps the first 20 minutes, 15 of them are spent on the same basic move. When she does mix it up, again, it is repetitive. There are maybe 8 different moves in this video, that are simply done over and over again. On top of that, the cuing could be better, and the moves could be detailed a bit more. She kind of just jumps into them.I will say, she seems lovely, and some of the moves can be fun. However, this video is simply too repetitive, and too easy (I hardly broke a sweat, I may as well have gone on a walk outside) to be worth the $15. I gave it two chances, both times I could hardly get through the first portion before putting in a different dvd. While I would love to add hip hop into my routine, unfortunately, this isn't the video to do that."
2,Generic music,The music on this video is generic hiphop beats---no familiar songs on it so the workout quickly becomes monotonous. I also found the workout a bit hard on the knees.
3,Workout Routine,"I found this to be a good alternative to my workout routine. It was fun and engaging. And you really do get a good sweat and workout. Besides, it brings back some fun memories with the dances."
3,Very basic cardio DVD.,"As someone who works out with dance DVDs regularly, I was pretty disappointed by this one. I barely broke a sweat and the instructed had regular ""break"" periods where you are just supposed to swing your hips.To me, this is simply not a real work out. I did the entire DVD and didn't really feel like I had worked out at all.This DVD would be more suited for beginners who don't have much dance experience and aren't really in good shape."
5,FABULOUS,"I first saw this workout on the FIT TV channel. It is worth the money. I only wish there were more like it. It beats those high priced workout exercise videos advertised on the television, anyday."
4,One of the best debuts in the past 10 years!,"Few choirs match Alabama State Mass for sheer energy. This, their first recording, isn't quite as polished as their follow up ""My Soul Got Another Dip,"" but it's still well worth buying. After nearly 10 years it's still one of the best albums by a southern gospel choir. Buy it!"
2,Used CD - Worth it!,The used CD was in good condition and I'm glad I was able to purchase it at a very low price.
1,Not worth buying!!,This book is not worth buying. It is only about 6 pages long and has barely a sentence on each page. You can be done reading it to your child in about 30 seconds even if you read it very slowly.
1,User Unfriendly,"This product is the most user unfriendly product I have ever seen. It just doesn't work right.The box was opened when I received it, the directions were ambiguous, and the product itself flimsy. I would have returned it, but I had tried to use it and so it is now ""used"". I urge other customers to beware!"
3,"Broken upon arrival, but works","I bought this on Amazon for 23.00 after shipping. Thought it was worth a shot. First time I plugged it in and pushed ""play"" nothing happened, no light no nothing. I started to trouble shoot and found out the lid does not close far enough to trigger the safety mechanism to make sure it is closed before spinning. Finally I figured out to put a pair of small pliers on top and it runs just fine. Scratches are still visible after resurfacing, but games play fine.Like usual, you get what you pay for..."
1,Looks good but that is its most redeeming quality,Have tried several times to clean and/or repair cd's with it not accomplishing either. Satisfaction rating should be zero (0)
1,Terrible Machine,"I bought this from Target and it worked great the first few times. Then, the discs (in the machine, not the ones I'm repairing) became crooked and eventually stopped working."
3,The weirdest of the six UY movies,"ok, this one confused me more than any other anime, even Kite. for example, i didn't know Lum could talk to birds. in the beginning, things are going good, making a movie, shoppin, a nice false front (big trouble in little china is where i got the line), but then, there are the birds, the losing of the powers, the strange voices, the dreams, and the entitles. let's just say, you'll need a deep psychological and philisophical understanding to watch this one. overall it's ok, you'll have to watch it five or six times to grasp it."
3,"Wonderful game, but missing instructions","I was so excited to receive my game in the mail, but when it got it here it was missing the instruction sheet, a fact they failed to mention in the quality of the item, so I am slightly disappointed."
3,So Confusing!,"I just received this game for Christmas, and as a die hard 15 year old Harry Potter fan, I never thought I wouldn't be able to figure it out. I just cant figure it out. ... The game looks really nice, and i know it was reallu expensive so I hope I get it figured out soon."
3,HUH!?!?Can someone explain this to me?,"I have read and re-read the directions to this game over and over and still don't think I've quite got it right. We have tried to play this game a few times but the kids get bored with me trying to figure out/explain how to play and opt for another game instead. I explained how I thought the game was played but it seemed too easy and was played to completion in a matter of a few minutes. The kids got impatient and wanted to make up their own rules on how to play! The concept and design of the game seemed very good and original for a trivia-type game. The trivia part is the easily understood part but the act of playing Quidditch while doing it has me confused with its many rules. Not sure how many stars to rate this game, I mean it might be fun if we can figure it out."
2,Lack any depth on how really set up a Data Warehouse,"I am just starting a large scale Data Warehouse project. I hoped this book would give real insight to architect the solution - but I found the book weak and superficial - too much focused on the ""usual"" project team fluff"
2,Decent but there's better out there.,"If you wanted to get two three books I wouldn't get this one. The same author wrote ""Business Intelligence Roadmap"" which I find to be a much more comprehensive book. Coming from a Java App implementation background I found this book lacking in depth, and much of the material was much better explained in the BI Roadmap and the Lifecycle toolkit book - making this book a bit redundant."
3,Need a big update,In general a very good book about the topic. it didn't bring much new information than I found using 2 hours surfing on the Internet.It dosn't say a word about agile projectmodels - that is a seriuos lack. Therefore a big update is recommended to the writer!
1,"Superficial, hardly any practical value",The book spends too much time on general project management topics and contains virtually nothing that can be practically applied to a data warehouse project. Too superficial.
5,"high quality, good looks","This is the second Minka-Aire fan we have purchased. We use the fan every night in both summer and winter. The summary is, expensive but high quality, high performance, low maintenance. Great product."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Beware--the Minka Group's customer support is terrible. When the fan breaks, as ours did, the employees will refuse to help you. The Lifetime Warranty apparently only applies to the dealers."
5,"A VERY GRAND TOUR OF ITALY, ART, ARCHITECTURE, AND HISTORY","My favorite type of travelogue commingled with high quality commentary on art and history laced with often intriguing personal takes on the times and customs. Brian Sewell is the perfect quirkily humorous and curmudgeonly educator and travel companion. The visual treatment of the artwork and the many destinations are as fine as I've ever seen. Whether or not you differ or agree with Sewell's judgments of the art and architecture, it is a grand tour conducted by a grand guide."
5,LOVED IT!,"I loaded this into iTunes an ran to the cadences every day for months until I broke my leg. Doctor says it was from increasing pace and mileage too quickly, which may have resulted from the ease with which these cadences increased my stamina and ability. Enjoy but beware!"
5,Run to Cadence with U.S. Marines,"I ordered this C.D. and it is excellent. I am a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Air Force. Contrary to popular belief we do P.T. Our P.T. has not been so great here lately and we needed motivation.I listened to the Run with Marines C.D. and ate it up. This gave me a plan to Run my guys with Cadence. I called some of the cadence from this C.D. and we improved out P.T. dramatically. I recommend this C.D. for anyone.Next time you feel yourself getting down and out on your run, formation runs, Ruck runs, ect. Purchase this C.D. It will motivate you.Ooohhh Rahhhh"
4,The most enjoyable of the series,"I have three or four of these cadence cassettes. Clearly, running to cadence is not for everyone. But for those who do, you will find that the pace is perfect for a good, steady run. Out of the series, I found that the USMC one was, though repetitive, the most oustanding. There is a good mix of humor, motivation, and good ol' Marine violence. Some of the others, especially the Army ones, are dated back to Vietnam or the Cold War when they talk about commies, UH-1s, etc.I wish they had a rated R version as well. These are rather tame compared to the reality. Still, its a great inspiration to anyone who was, wants to be, or wishes they were running with the Corps."
3,Good but not great,"I liked the cadence, it brought back a lot of memories. The biggest thing that i disliked about it was the ""boot"" in it. I got tired of hearing D.I.'s, platoon numbers and recruit trainig oriented stuff. I thought it was cadence from the fleet!On the flip side, there was several cadences that i did not know and a few that i did not remember the words for.I would highly recommend this CD for people waiting to go to boot camp, or NCO's that are looking to expand their cadence calling ability. As always, just be ready to ad-lib."
4,Excellent Graphics,"My nine-year-old actually decided upon this book. She was given the choice of any book in the store and picked this one because of the photographic layout. This particular book provides a fun method to learn about a historic figure without becoming bored with the material. My daughter is a visual learning. So this particular style of writing, encouraged her to keep turning the page. Overall, a very informative story that entertains even young readers. Very appropriate also for completing homework assignments. What I also enjoyed about the book was the ""bubbles"" of information that defined terms for younger readers. For example, page 10 uses the word plantation in the text and the page provides a description of the meaning of the word plantation. These type of additions truly help the young reader learn something new."
2,For correct and crummy,To expect anything from this publication other than shallow and misleading would be correct. To the father of our country deserves only the best. I recommend Sacred Fire by Dr Peter Lillback. It is a treasure that you will be proud to own.
4,Good service/ high shipping and handling cost,"I needed several more copies of the book about George Washington for our study in Adult Education class. The books came in a timely fashion and were in perfect shape. The delivery was fine and the cost for the books was reasonable , but I thought that the shipping cost was high. I would use your service again - but would try to combine it with another order to make use of a lower shipping cost."
5,Illumined by Flashes,"This is an experience in itself; it is history, poetry, criticism (literary and social). It is all bound up within Howe's ""alternative"" perspective of American literary history. It is a reading of the blanks and erasures still discoverable in primary documents.It is a kind of commonplace book of Howe's reading with commentary. Not only are the quotations new (to one not steeped in Puritan literature from the 1630s) but they are utterly contemporary in what we experience still in this Puritan land.These glimpses are flashes of brilliant light in the thunder storm of a dangerous and violent American culture."
5,Just perfect!,All the great songs in one perfect video.If you like Stereophonics a little you must have it. They're better and better all the time!God save the Stereophonics!
1,tiny Useless for a serious cook,"This is a TINY Mortar with less than 2 oz. use-able capacity. It will hold about 4 oz. liquid, but good luck using it for more than an ounce or two of herbs. The description DOES NOT make that clear. Buy it if you want a toy but NOT to crush herbs for cooking."
1,Warning! This is a PLAY not a NOVEL,"BE AWARE!!! This is a Play and NOT a Novel. Amazon needs to update their description of this item. My Grandson needed this book to read before school starts back. An Amazon customer service person even helped me order it because he needed it quickly. We were greately disapointed when we received it. Now we have to go through the process of returning it, and ordering the correct item. Just hope the correct item comes in time for him to get it read before school starts."
2,not what i expected,ordered this for a x-mas present for my cousin and didn't know it was a play style book. was disappointed but had no time to return. she is 10 and hope she liked it.
1,Not the book but the written play!,"This is not the book so be careful if you order this - it is the written play of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"". Now I have to send it back for a refund - this could have been avoided if Amazon has a number you can call and talk to a person and get a better description of the book."
1,Diary of Anne Frank,I did not get the product I wanted due to a lack of photo. The description did not tell me that the book I was purchasing was in play format. I wish to return the book.
1,What do people see in this story?,"I have only one thing to say about this story...I thought it was plain STUPID! What is it with people's obsession's with Anne Frank anyway? Her diary is one of the most BORING stories I have ever read. There is nothing appealing about Anne's story. She focuses only on herself and barely explains any of the characters. Overall, this was an AWFUL book and Anne had no impact on me whatsoever."
4,Good edition,"This edition was very well done, and I applaud the efforts of the Ms. Kesselman to use the most powerful parts of Anne's diary to stay truthful to the story. However, as a HS theatre director, this is not one that I could use in my class without pause. It uses some sexually charged passages from Anne's diary, making it a little awkward to tell this heart-rending story on a HS stage. I think I will go back to the previous version for my students."
3,trying to hear song samples>>>,VERY VERY VERY VERY RARE I CANNOT FIND A PLACE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THESE SONGS LET ALONE EVEN HEAR A SAMPLE OF THEM!!!
1,Don't Buy or Read,"If you have a hard time getting into books and following along and have a short attention span don't read this book.Its boring, uninteresting and well basically I have read a total of like 5 pages in it, and it put me to sleep multiple times for all the assignments i have to read out of it. I am failing my online class because this book cannot caputre my attention and Its soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring. Uninteresting and doesn't capture my interest in anyway.If you like politics and being bored to death with history, this book is for you!"
2,It sucks....,"I bought this CD because of one song ""Something Inside So Strong""..what I got is not what I heard in the sample,...I have been looking for the version since I heard it on a Cassette years ago...it sucks...to say I'm disappointed is an understatement...I went through All the CDs sold by Amazon...its not what I paid for..."
4,"Great anime, but it is a side story :(","I strongly reccomend to anyone who has seen any of the UC gundam to get this DVD set. It has a great story and adds to the develpment of the One Year War. Showing things from the Zeon perspective and from a neutral point also. After viewing this dvd you will learn that in war there are no winners and that both sides were no better than the other, they both had good people and they both had corrupt people. If you know little or nothing about the original Gundam, this title may not be for you. The main draw back has to be the price for the few episodes and the fact that it is a side story to 0079."
3,Gundam 0080 - War in the Pocket,"(...)P>This anime has an ""interesting"" story that revolves around a young boy caught in the crossfire between the Earth Federation and the forces of Zeon.The reason why only give this a 3 out of 5 is the fact that the animation isn't that spectacular, and it's also supported by a not-so-strong plot.It is after all, a side story of the Universal Century timeline."
4,good movie,this movie is awsome but you are going to want the other volumes and you will quickley clean your wallet.so instead of paying $75 for all 3 dvd volumes i would recomend buying the $50 vhstrilogy.But if you won the lotto this ones fine
1,this show sucked nuts,man this was the worst gundam EVER boring as hell whiney little kid that cries for 6 episodes and the zakus are cooler than the gundam is what the hell? that shouldn't be that way and the story made zeon seem like innocent people fighting for freedom when they are trying to kill millions by droppig a space colony on earth. i really hated this show and there was hardly any battles and it's a friekin gundam show! don't but this get 0083 or wing or any other kinda of gundam avoid this show at all costs.
5,"This Is my ""Top Shelf"" Indoor training DVD","Put this DVD in your player and head straight to training in the Great area around Las Vegas including, The Valley of Fire. I love the scenery and like the music a lot. How about the bands Sevenaya and the Rastaman Music... I usually make the degree of suggested exertion about two levels higher than what's suggested: So if it says a 6, I usually run about an 8. Also I usually stand about a minute or so past what they suggest. And through in a few additional one minute sprints when they are at recovery for ""far"" too long. With these additions, I think it's a VERY chalenging and affective workout.BTW- I've seen other DVD's from Endurance Films and was dissappointed because they are not near as thought out as this tape was...Kudo's!"
1,Later videos in this series are much better,"I purchased this video because I already owned two others in the series- North Carolina and Southern California (both are great). It's clear that they hadn't quite worked out the bugs yet on this one. The music tempo, heart rate target, RPE target, and the actions of the riders on the screen are not coordinated. at all. Whiny alternative ballads, with the riders on screen lightly spinning- but you're supposed to be pegged at 90% MHR? 85% MHR = RPE of 6?There's also no indication of what's coming up in the workout for the first half of the movie. So when a short interval flashes on the screen, it takes a good portion of the time to find the correct gearing. They seemed to realize this problem halfway through.If anybody wants a free copy, you can have mine."
5,Nice ride,"I like this DVD. I don't live in the desert, but I miss it, so it's nice to see the landscape on this ride. I also like it because it's long (about 57 minutes) and pushes you about the right amount. I always sweat a lot while doing this ride and I like the prompts to push a little harder through the hills. The music is also pretty good. The only thing they could have choreographed better is that they are sometimes going down hills and vice versa when I'm supposed to be going up a or down a hill. This is a minor detail and one that should't dissuade you from buying this if you need a little incentive to step up how hard you push yourself on your stationary bike. It's well worth the money. I no longer live near a gym, so I bought a bunch of cycle DVD's and this is one of my favorites (other one is Spinervals 4.0, lean and mean - a pretty hard interval workout)."
1,"ok, but I don't like the distractions","This was the first one of this type I've gotten because of reviews I read on Amazon. The dvd was ok, but for me personally I don't like the onscreen distractions (like other riders in front of you) or pop-ups graphs, etc., like so many of the other indoor cycling videos these days have."
5,More Useful than Before.,"I think it was an excellent idea for Hawthorne to release separate books concerning behavior, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and learning disabilities as they are a substantial improvement over the old, and lone, PRIM manual. I bought all three of them when they first came out. I had to do this because I found that sharing a building copy with an entire building was simply not practicable. What I usually do with these pages are to reword the recommendations and then issue them to teachers in a form that is personalized and easy to digest. Copying pages for them, I'm sure you'll find, is not an effective way of getting them to make use of these materials. If you ask me, this one was well worth the money."
1,Give us more information,"This looks like a great product but why didn't you gives us information on the thread size??? Is it 1/4"" NTP??? Now I'm worried I didn't buy the right one."
2,not up to scratch,"Merline Loavelace did very well with her Codename: Danger series, especially the earlier ones that culminated with the romance between Adam and Maggie. Her new series, To Protect and Defend' comes nowhere near the sizzle in Codename: Danger. It's a pity as Lovelace is so talented and leaves you wanting more after each title. I found A Question of Intent mediocre, there was no suspense neither did the romance between Jill and Cody sparkle. No fireworks, no witty repartees and nothing in the plot to make this book worth reading. I have Full Throttle to be read and if it's no different from Question of Intent, I'm going to have to give Lovelace a miss until she comes out with a single title."
5,Gods Gifted,"Anthony is a very anointed person. His cd is awesome and it hits home in a lot of different areas of my life. I know the artist personally and he loves to worship and praise God. God has bless this man with an anointed talent and I am glad to know him and blessed that he is sharing what God has bless him with, with me and others."
3,Does anyone know if the titles in this collection have been released by themselves,Hi before i buy this collection does anyone know if these three titles have been released in single form?thanks
4,spongebob fan,"This fun game was given to my 5 year old. It's a lot like candy land, except you land on little bubbles. You will have to read each bubble to make your way to the Krusty Krab. You need to collect gold coins to enter and win. The game comes with 8 small figures a set of spongebob, sandy, sqidward and patrick. My five year old loves it. Each bubble has a cute saying such as; Laugh like Patrick, or Lose coins for wripping your pants. ALl based on the tv show. Very cute and worth the money. Uses some reading and counting skills."
4,kids love it,"This is really fun. We bought it for our son, and our older daughter plays it too. They have a good time, and it teaches patience with having to take turns. It is good for kids that are beginners at reading, and is also good for counting. Would recommend for Spongebob fans!!! :-)"
1,Not as good as it should be,"This game sucks. It is another example of Nickelodeon's habit of rushing things to market with little thought. It is true that each bubble has a saying and/or an action for the player to do, but considering the wittiness and originality of the show, the sayings and activities are pathetic. Nick should have put about 100 more hours into designing this game...then it would live up to expectation."
5,Heart Warmed!,"A moving, wonderful reminder of how much we need the meek and powerless to teach us... I read this in one sitting and was deeply touched... I came to love that phrase ""the house of Oliver"", because Chris brings us to Oliver, and others like him, and we find ourselves loving them also..."
3,cheap book ok,I wanted a cheap copy of a book that I had heard about. I didn't plan on keeping the book. I just wanted to read it.The copy that I received for a buck served that purpose and I have already passed it on to someone else.
5,This is TRULY an ANOINTED project!,"When I first heard this CD, I really beagn to cry because the words of just about every song were really ministering to my soul! ""He Cares"", ""Delight Thyself"", and ""He's My Everything"" are the most slamming tracks on the CD! This is the CD to get for a time such as this that we are living in! This choir has a sound that will grab your heart very quickly!"
1,a merchandising add-on,"Surprisingly disappointing.Not so much a companion item, rather a merchandising add-on to cash in on the success of the television series.The book adds nothing new to the tv series, and at times reads as an after thought than a diary of events."
4,Great companion to the series,"I found this a terrific companion to the series. It accounts for the journey day-by-day and fills in the gaps left from video editing and government restrictions (there were many areas the camera crew was either not allowed to film or weren't allowed to enter). It also gives a little of the behind-the-scenes to the series, which I always appreciate. Along with all this information, the journal is written much as you'd expect from Michael Palin and is, in itself, an enjoyable travel book."
5,Thoroughly entertaining,"Believe it or not it has been 24 years since Michael went round the world, and the world has changed a lot in that time. Michael, however, has not lost any of his star quality, this is a thoroughly entertaining read, in nice easy ""chunks"", with enough detail and fascinating observations to make it ""unputdownable"". Have now ordered Full Circle, as I could not get enough."
3,A good international thriller,"Good, but not great. This books main problem is that the writing is exhorbantly long-winded in the first part of the book, as he unexcitely drones on and on about the main character's past. Its not that the characters aren't deep and well drawn out, it's just that I didn't appreciate the way they were drawn out. It made for boring reading. However, I'm very glad that I resisted the urge to put the book down. Once the action starts, this book becomes a fantastic work of exciting international espionage. Quinnell is a master at giving the reader an inside look at the covert spy game. Quinnell is becoming one of my favorite authors, and I still have no clue why his books aren't in circulation."
4,Praise the Lord for Yolanda!,Yolanda Adams has became one of gospel greatest voices. This album is so great you can feel the anointing off of this album. Even though I love Yolanda at anything she sings. But I really love her live. God Bless You Yolanda Adams.
1,useless paper weight,"The book is loaded with engine rebuilding information but not so much detail on information for DIY home mechanic. It shows you how you can check the power steering fluid level, but does not cover how you can change the fluid nor shows you how to replace the filter inside(yes, there is one. you will see it after sucking all the fluid out). Just about the only useful information you will get out of this book is how you can make a fan clutch special tool by taking the 12 point wrench and grinding it to make it smaller. The most important tune up step - rebuilding diesel injectors is not covered. It does have 5 steps to remove injectors from injector block. No information on turbo rebuilding, no information on removing voltage regulator out of alternator (alternator brush is part of the regulator)."
4,Thee M-B 300TD shop manual,"This manual covers most everything tat the normal garage mechanic would need to repair his/her classic Diesel Benz wagon. While it's good for most, there are areas that are lacking such as the locating of door seal leaks as well as the method of replacement of any leaky seals. Finally I think it would have been a great idea to supply a list of part numbers for the parts used in the cars. One of the most difficult problems that this writer has encountered is determining part numbers when many of them are VIN dependent.Thanks for the read."
3,Not as helpful as hoped,"This book is of some use, but not nearly as much as hoped. The wiring digrams are OK, and some of the simple procedures quite adequate, but all too often one finds: ""this adjustment should be left to your dealer or a properly equipped shop.""...if we wanted to do that, we wouldn't buy such a book in the first place!"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I would think for as many of these cars are still on the road, better pictures, diagrams would be available. Text is comprehensive and complete, but lack of good illustrations is disappointing."
1,"The old adage ""you get what you pay for"" is very true.","This manual is a consistent with others in this series. For [...], it is better than not having any information ... but not much better. Most of the procedures are sketchy at best, they will get an inexperienced mechanic into trouble quickly by omitting key steps in repair procedures. In many parts of the book, you will read ""due ot the complexity of [fill in part or system here] ... this should not be undertaken by the home mechanic."" They then proceed to omit the important information and provide you with generic procedures. Save your pennies and invest in the official Mercedes-Benz manaul."
4,A Good Value For the Money,"If you plan on doing serious work on your Mercedes, this is NOT the only manual you'll need. It is, however, a useful maintenance reference that nicely fills the gap between the owner's manual and the factory service CD. It's also useful for alternate procedures that don't assume you have the special tools that the factory procedures require. The pictures are clear, and the diagrams are mostly lifted directly from the factory service manual."
3,Book Covers Only 123-style Diesels,"This is an excellent reference for the owners of 123-style MB diesels. However, if you own a 126 or other, this will give you potential hints, but will not apply to all the issues you may face. You will need other references to cover those, such as either ""used"" MB shop manuals, or by finding a decently-priced copy of the ""official"" MB repair manuals on CD-ROM ..."
3,"It's just so, so.","Very basic information. This manual comes up way short on the inner workings of the Mercedes 123 series. Something needs fixing on you old classic? You might get lucky and find how to fix it in this book...then again there's just as good a chance you won't. Especially if you aren't afraid to tackle those problems that require some time to fix (because shop labor is getting real expensive) and you'd rather fix them yourself and save the money. After all, isn't that why you're thinking of buying the book?This is real rudimentary...don't expect to get everything you want from this manual. Example: you want to repair your transmission? Good luck! This book will get you far enough to get you in big trouble and leave you standing in the lurch without enough info to complete the job...then guess what? Off to the shop anyway...the whole basket case!Want to install new brakes? No problem...it's all right here. Just do buy it for the complicated stuff...ok?"
2,It's not the best,"It doesn't cover some of the procedures I need to do. The pictures and instructions are bad. I use it sometimes, but much prefer the pdf of the technicians manual that I got on-line for the same price."
3,General Mercedes info...,Good starting point for working on your Mercedes. Not a lot of detail on the more complicated repairs for the car
1,Lesbian Vampires Don't Always Make A Good Movie,"Sir Jub-Jub usually finds lesbian vampire movies to be a very interesting viewing experience, this film, however, is a very bad time for all. ""Caress of the Vampire"" is complete trash, no production values, no story, no acting, no inventiveness on the filmmaker's part at all. I would love to relate the story but there is not one, it is simply a soft-core coupling of two females for the majority of the running time. Had the film went the course of hard-core pornography, at least there would have been something to talk about. How this film was released on DVD is beyond me and I hope no one wastes their time on this. If you want to see a real film on this subject, try Jess Franco's ""Vampyros Lesbos"" or ""Daughters of Darkness""."
1,Worst Vampire movie ever,"I have been collecting Vampire, and Vampire-erotica movies for several years now. It is my missfortune to own this one, it is the worst movie I have ever seen. If you know anyone who was associated with the making of this movie, pleae don't let them use a video camera again."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER MADE,"There are movies with worse camera angles. Cinematography was decent. There are movies with uglier actresses. Some were pretty hot. But if this in a horror movie, it should be scary, and if it's a porn it should be erotic. Not much of a plot was expected for a porn movie, but this wasn't porn. There was not one kiss in the entire movie, and the only crotch shot there was, was the bonus footage of one of the actresses taking a non-seductive bath by herself, and yes, it's as stupid that it sounds. Until now, Leprachaun 4 took the cake as the worst movie ever. Move over, little green guy, SPACEAGE LESBIAN VAMPIRES have sunken to depths you just could not reach. Avoid at all costs. It's not even something you can just laugh at. Just boring. But I am putting it on ebay, so someone buy it! :-)"
2,Not bad for sexploitation video!,"I watched this movie and its sequel , both on the same disc, the other night. part one was not too bad. It showed skill in its technical side and moved at a mediocre pace. However, the sequel was just not very good. It was hard to watch and dull and repetitious. I dont understand how they even call it a sequel. But not the worst I've ever seen. However, it was unbelievably distributed by the same people who released The Realm of Bizarre. That was a fantastic movie. The best indi-horror I've seen in a long, long time. If you can find it, i recomend it highly! love, Louis Cyphre"
5,a very bad movie,"bad acting, bad script, bad directing, bad lighting, low sound quality, low vidio quality, I loved it!"
3,Not the best of it's kind,"I might have liked this movie better if it had some sort of, well storyline. What I could make out of it these alien vampires were trying to recuit new vampires on earth, while being persued by two stupid cops (who were always one step behind). Most of the movie (if you call 45 min. a movie)is just a bunch of sex scenes. Nice as that is you can't make a movie out of that. The tape also includes a sort of making of at the end to fill time. Some how I did like this movie (dumb as it is). I would recommend it, but don't look for a lot of blood and gore here."
2,"A little imagination, and this one might have been GOOD!","OK, we've got this lesbian vampire. Sounds like a plot that writes itself, right? I picture this hot-looking Gothic babe setting her sights on a number of innocent swimsuit-model-types, with lots of seduction scenes of her enslaving them to her evil & lascivious desires! But no, this particular film went a different route --- a very BORING route! Yes, she's a lesbian, but the only real girl-girl scene is her with another lesbian vampire --- ho hum! She eventually does get around to seducing her good-looking neighbor, but it's pretty bland. There's also a scene where the other lesbian vampire does a lap dance for some guy before attacking his throat --- ho hum, again."
1,Ghastly,Possibly the worst vampire movie I have ever seen. No plot to speak of and the acting is nonexistant. If you are interested in seeing several exotic dancers in fangs then this is the movie for you!
1,Yawn,"What a poorly made film. Some bad films are funny albeit unintentionally. Some are so bad, that they reach cult status.This is not one of those films. This is just something you would give someone to cure them of insomnia.What a pitty we can't give half stars in reviews, beacuse that's all this deserves.Oh yes, I got the 'special edition / keep case'Keeping the case was what I did, so it didn't turn out to be a total waste of money."
1,Dont Buy It,"I am a prfessional Chef, I bought this Bag Because I use global knives, the bag sucks it actually broke my favorite global knive in half when I put it in their. I am done with globals for good."
2,What a disappointment!,I bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas and it's been played once. The pieces of luggage fall off the tree regardless of how carefully you arrange them. We spent most of our time putting fallen pieces of luggage back instead of trying to take them off. Save your money.
2,Disappointing,"My son asked for this for his bd and we got it for him. He didn't ask to play it again after the first time we played it. It's really not very much fun, the tree just rotates back and forth and you are to take off one of each school supply to win. This is definitely going to be a dust-catcher in the back of the closet. Save the [$$$]."
5,great fun,This is such a fun game. Its great for any true Harry Potter fan.It came super fast and in perfect condition.Very pleased with product and seller.
1,Very Boring,"My kids, ages 6 and 3 1/2 played this game for about 20 minutes and became bored. As the others wrote, the object of the game is to pick items off the tree as the tree rotates. Since we end up knocking more items off than actually picking them off, the game becomes tiresome and a yawner. A waste of money."
1,To be honest...,"DM Canright renounced his faith several times. This has nothing to do with others, and all the more to do with the fact that he was a very tough person to reach or understand and had his own deep dark spiritual battles that he denied often. Historical study reveals that Canright had a vendetta against women in his time which honestly was his fuel to focus on writing against ""Ellen"". Furthermore this book is based on opinion. And when one reads from someone elses opinion often it is slanted to one side and does not share the full picture in the correct light. This is usual. However the depths at which he goes to expose what he finds to be error is uncouth. I cannot read a book for long that solely has a purpose to abuse and not share the real issues objectively. Those are my thoughts."
2,Intresting......,This is not in my case a very good video. It is somewhat boring. I hope the other pokemon installments are much better than this.
1,Not A Big Pokemon Fan.,I don't like Pokemon but like Digimon can you beleive it? My classmate Esteban loves Pokemon 2000 so I figure he likes this video.
1,STOP: Wrong Photo for this Part,PN# 901965 is for REAR Shock Mounting Kit. The photo is a FRONT Strut Mounting Kit.Order this PN# if you want a REAR mount kit.Order PN# 902905 if your want a FRONT mount kit
5,Enjoyable Shivers,"Nice mix of mystery, suspense and terror! Great descriptions, realistic settings and believable characters."
2,A little bit here and there,"Although many good points are made in this easy to read book, it clearly suffers from a lack of target audience definition. As a theoretical intro to the field, one doesn't need to know how to customize a screen in SAP. As an intro user's guide, one doesn't need to know many of the more technical topics briefly discussed. Since there isn't enough coverage for any one audience, I can't recommend this book."
3,"Not bad, but out of date","Positives: Decent overview for the complete SAP novice, through a variety of perspectives:- SAP Architecture- SAP User's POV- POV of the Manager considering SAP- POV of the IT/Project Manager planning an SAP deploymentNegatives:- Somewhat out of date (hard to prevent in the IT world)- A little dry at times (hard to [prevent in the SAP world ;)- IT people will be left wanting more- Can sound like SAP marketing material at times"
2,Good for an introductory book,A good level of detail but unless you were in the field you would not be able to understand or follow the information without something to relate the knowledge base to.
5,Memories,"What more is there to say? A beautiful woman and a beautiful, sensuous voice. I fell in love with her and her music the first time I heard her back in the early seventies. It's so sad how her life ended up but I am happy she left us with the gift of her all too few albums."
4,"This is a very well written, positive and uplifting CD!","I listen to ""I Can"" over and over (and over) again because the message is so encouraging. It's the same type of song as ""It Shall Be Done"" - another uplifting song. This CD is full of music that is not only performed well, but also has a great message. I pray that Daryl Coley will keep writing and performing songs like these."
4,What A Man!,"I don't know where to start, but this man is awesome. God really created a voice when he created Daryl Coley. My two favorite songs are ""Even Me"" and ""Don't Give Up on Jesus"" w/Vanessa Bell Armstrong (My Girl), their voices blend so well. I've never heard anyone top Daryl's version of ""Even Me"". I don't think there will be one to top that. Well maybe one can - Tonex! Love ya Daryl!"
3,too woodsy,"altho it makes a nice lather the pine aroma is too strong for facial use. Ive relegated this soap to the tub collection. for the body as a showersoap, the smell is tolerable."
2,Disappointing lather,"Smelled great, but the lather was disappointing. Not very slick, no matter how I mixed it, whipped it or otherwise fiddled with the ratio of soap to water."
2,Not my style,The scent is close to pine-sol and very medicinal in nature. Was never able to really get past it. Lather was slightly better than a modern Williams puck but nothing exceptional. Hoping for more of a pine tar smell.
3,ok chewable for a small animal,"I have both a guinea pig and rabbit and they both enjoy blocks, more so my bunny. These last about a week with her so not bad. The only thing is I like to put their toys on a holder and these don't have any holes so I drilled them and they work well."
1,Not worth the price,"The video is helpful for someone thinking about adopting from China, but it is not worth the price. Home movie quality and not very in-depth."
4,Chock full of info,"This is an excellent video for people starting their process of adoption from China. It's main focus is on the trip to pick up your daughter. They do a great job with the lists of things to bring and how to pack. I have watched it twice and have started making my list. It also makes a good point to start researching your pediatrician now, if you don't already have one. Most of the girls are sick when you get them and a doctor can perscribe mild medications to make your new daughter's plan ride home a lot easier and more comfortable for everyone.The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is the quality of the tape. It should be converted to DVD and the sound quality should be improved."
4,A must-see for anyone adopting from China,"From ""considering"" to ""waiting"" this video covers it all. My husband & I especially appreciated the complete listings of items to pack, VERY HELPFUL!! I referred back to it many times during our waiting period for help preparing, as well as just a little support. Some of the information may be a bit confusing or not apply to your family since details vary from agency to agency and laws are changing all the time. But overall I would highly recommend this video for anyone adopting from China or even considering adopting from China."
4,As described,The price is right! They are a little scratchy but still comfortable and warm enough. I am a female with long slender hands and the small fits me great.
4,Satisfcatory,"These gloves did what they said they would and not much more. They're good liners and good for just walking around or for short outside trips. Not remarkable, but worth the buy if you need extra liners or cheap simple gloves."
2,poorly made,"These were shipped quickly but they are poor quality. There are strings dangling on fingers and do NOT seem to be 100% wool, like the other gloves I have."
4,good gloves,"i love rag wool gloves. these are no different. the only reason i didnt give five stars is the thumbs are long on me. they dont really "" fit like a glove"""
2,Did they switch manufacturers?,"I've bought these same type of gloves on at least four different occasions but the last pair I bought were below the usual standard. The wool in the previous gloves I bought were durable and stayed cohesive but this current pair kept shedding like a wool sweater. Certain portions of the gloves shed to the point that the only thing there now is the cotton mesh foundation that the wool was attached to.While the other pairs would last months (I use them at work), I've had these less than a month and I already need a new pair."
2,Two stars for effort,"An unreadable exposition of the unknowable, or at least the ineffable. When Aquinas awoke to the realization that all his work was as straw, he probably didn't imagine that Milbank and company would be trying to send us back into that scholastic sleep one day. A little apophatic humility wouldn't go amiss here."
1,Save your money,"I purchased this toy, so that I can blow some bubbles for my 2 year old daughter. The product looks bright and freindly, but failed to do its job. First, the bubble resevoir kept leaking bubble mix on to my hand. Second, the toy failed to make any bubbles. I tried different bubble mixes in the toy, each time with no bubbles. It is supposed to make tiny bubbles, within a large bubble. It did not. There is no way I could control the amount of air from the blower to make bubbles. The blower was too much for the bubbles."
1,Waste Of Money,This was a huge disappointment. It leaked everywhere and just made a big mess. Had a hard time making it blow a bubble and we tried different bubble solutions and none worked well enough to acutally blow some bubbles. Not a good purchase.
5,A Trap Indeed,"After reading this book I did quite a search in academic journals on the same theme - drugs in sports, and there is a lot of support for what is presented here. Drugs in sport is a serious issue out there and it has been there for a couple of decades now. This book was a superb informative read.I think there could not be a better author/person to present this information to us, and I admire Francis for taking this role on."
2,Where was the editor?,"Sorry to disagree with everyone, but I am greatly displeased with this book. The pictures are beautiful! But there are only eleven pages of text, in very large type, and with a lot of pictures there too. Which means there is very, very, very little information. And in that small amount of information, I found several inaccuracies, therefore I can't TRUST any of the information I DON'T recognize as being inaccurate. There are very few mentions of famous designers, but two of their names are misspelled. An oval rhinestone is the same shape as a marquise rhinestone, it says. There are TWO pictures which each contain three similar-but-different items, where the captions in both cases say that the picture shows three IDENTICAL items. And the price listings are SO MUCH higher than what I see on even the highest priced web sites or jewelry shows in the New York area. Umm, pretty pictures though."
5,Works great,It worked great! It was easy to use and did a great job cleaning the stove pipe. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a fireplace or wood stove
4,As Advertised,Purchase arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly as advertised. It's what I needed and the convenience of on-line shopping cannot be downplayed.
4,It works!,"It worked well. And I like the bristles. They are not metal, rather a very strong plastic. Cleaned my chimney great! Remember, though, you'll need to plan on how you're going to get it up or down the chimney. I dropped a light weight cable down from the top, attached the brush at the bottom, and pulled it up the chimney. Don't use string or twine...it'll break."
3,Anolon Nylon Pasta Fork,"THIS PASTA FORK IS OKAY, BUT THE HANDLE IS ALSO BULKY ON IT AS WELL AS HAVING HUGE VERY SHORT TEETH ..IT WILL DO IN A PINCH..."
5,Anolon Pasta Fork,I bought this one to replace one I had previously bought that my son borrowed and never returned. Anolon is a very good brand. So good you might not want to loan it out. They tend to not come back. They don't rust and wash up nicely in the dishwasher.
1,You'd be an idiot to buy this book,"The text is way, way too wordy. It could have been edited to a tenth of its length without any loss of content. The actual instruction is far too detailed to follow in any meaningful way, and the accompanying DVD is poorly organized, the video clips are far too brief, and the blurry fade-ins are very distracting. As you can tell, I was not happy with this purchase."
2,Lots of fat - not much meat...,"This book uses a lot of words, but fails to make clear how to master a dance step. Disappointing. It makes a good coffee table book (one leg was shorter than the rest.)"
3,"Tough skill, tough read","This book, as other reviewers have stated, is NOT for the complete idiot. You must invest a great deal of time and attention to get much out of it. Among other things, you'll have to read the ""how-to"" text several times to understand what the author is trying to get across to you, and the DVD doesn't make it any easier. I have learned what little dancing I now know largely from the gentle coaching my wife provided. She stayed a couple of steps ahead of me in the book (so to speak) and correctly interpreted the author's intentions. We can now waltz (a little) and continue to learn with each other's help.Don't expect this book to be an easy way to learn ballroom dancing."
4,Great for the absolute beginner,"This book will take you through the basic patterns of popular social dances and does a fairly adept job of doing so. This is purely a footwork book, as there is little mention of styling, but for the absolute novice it will get you out on the dance floor.I particularly enjoyed the section on rhythm and the emphasis that dancing is about doing the same motion, the exact same way every time, so you don't really have to have rhythm to dance, you just need to perform the same motion the same way consistently. I have a friend struggling with this same issue in his dancing and recommended this book to him, with the practice exercises included, to help him improve.All in all, a well written book for the novice dancer and one I recommend."
1,Not for beginners,"The professionals who have been reviewing this may love it, but the book is definitely not for beginners. It devotes pages and pages to posture, breathing technique, history and other such topics but precious little on the basics of what steps to dance. When, after 14 chapters he finally starts teaching you how to dance, it's almost incomprehensible. This guy does not know how to give simple instructions that most people will understand. If you are new to ballroom dancing, don't buy this book. It will be of little help."
3,ballroom for idiots,"I didn't realize I had already checked this book out from the library. It's a good book for the right person. I own a ballroom studio and I was hoping it would get my new boyfriend interested in ballroom dancing, but in fact it did just the opposite. He felt it was cheezy and written for older people. He is someone that would need to be sold more on the seduction associated with dancing not the more regal aspect."
2,Your feet cant read,"I have found that reading about a subject is of little value, you must perform the subject matter and repeat it many times over. A DVD that demonstrates the actual foot moves is by far more helpful. I have found the Vicki Regan DVD's to bet the best because they show you the steps many times over with and without music. Trust me, I am a pure amatuer on the dance floor, but watching Vicki and her partner show every move in stages, I can duplicate them. I'm still no Fred Astaire, but I guarantee you that watching the Regan DVD's will put you on the dance floor. I have Fox Trot, Waltz, Rhumba, Swing and niteclub DVD's. I'm still not brave enough to venture into Tango, Mambo or any of the extreme Latin dances...YET."
3,Pretty Good Book,"This guide does give one good background information on ballroom dancing, and has many illustrations. The accompanying music CD is good (not great, but good).My main complaint is that it can sometimes be a bit difficult to read, to follow. And there really should be a glossary of terms in the back, I had a difficult time finding what various acronyms meant.It's not really a book you can open up to, say, the section on the foxtrot and just learn how to do the foxtrot without first reading the rest of the book. It's meant to be read from start to finish before you begin learning any particular dance."
2,Too much guff,"This book has some great material, and its history bits are good, but if you just want some hints on learning to dance there is way too much 'stuff' you have to wade through before you get to anything about dancing ... you're half way through the book before you get to the actual dance steps - and too much stuff you have to wade through around each dance.If you want LOTS of history and detail, this is the book for you. If you want to get down to dancing ... it has some good info in it, but it takes a lot of work to find it"
2,Even an non-idiot might have difficulty wading through this,"I've had this book for 3 years now, and at the same time I've been taking weekly ballroom dance classes. I thought that as I got more hands-on instruction, I would feel more comfortable with the instructional part of the book. I never did. Now that I am far more advanced than what is taught in the book, I still feel a bit confused trying to figure out what the author trying to teach. OK, some maybe I'm an idiot, but if I am, then this book should be geared to me. If there were an accompanying DVD, then I think it would be much better."
2,Somewhat Passe',"This book follows the old low fat, low sugar rules of several years ago...We have been there and we are already doing that..."
5,Lovely to see the film again since 1960,"Black Orheus has been one of my favorite films since the first time I saw it in New York 1960. I bought the soundtrack and it has been a dream of mine to see the film again. I bought it on DVD from Amazon a short while ago and I was not disappointed to see it again after all this time. It sure is classical, I think. The colors, the Brazilian music, and the actors, I love to enjoy it all."
5,Pure Magic,"This film is not a perfect film in some respects, but it is a magical film. The story of Orpheus set again the backdrop of Carnival in Rio is terrific. The music is first rate."
4,Worth it for the music,"This is one of the best movies (for it's music) of all time. The samba and the dance bring the watcher into a place we would all love to enter. Of course it's not all good, with death stalking pretty girls and other pretty girls being jelous, but I think given the chance, we'd all step into this mostly idyllic Carnival world. I just wish they could have done something with the volume inconsistencies on this DVD. The songs (especially Orfeo's song) are much softer than the samba drumming and dancing scenes."
3,Black Orpheus,"A little slow, but one must consider how long ago it was produced. There was a lot of time wasting repetitive music scenes, but it was okay. I liked the film, especially the ending."
5,An unsung classic of the cinema,"A marvelous, uplifting, and at times terrifying transplantation of the myth of Orpheus and Euridyce into Carnival in Rio in the late 1950's, demonstrating (but without pretense) the universality of that myth. The all black cast, which must have been quite radical for the times, is sensational, the scenes of Carnival are incredibly vivid, the samba music which is omnipresent truly transports one to another world, and the plot (which I don't want to give it away, simple though it may be), is quite riveting. One barely needs the subtitles even though the film is in Portugese, the acting is so good. And even though the myth is a tragedy the film ends on an uplifting note of regeneration and rebirth. An unforgettable, unique film."
2,I'm very pleased with the products I received.,"What pleased me was the promptness with which my orders were processed. I received everything in perfect condition. The items were, as I expected, of high quality. The book by Tama Kieves was excellent, I will learn much from this spirited and intelligent author. The music and video were also exactly what I wanted. I am very pleased with the service you provided."
3,Dated,"Dated technology and direction, useful as a bookmark in movie history and for showing the beginnings of Brazilian music popularity in the US. I liked being able to see the Rio hills before they became an immense sprawl of slums."
2,Would not recommend it.,My mom was interested in this movie and that is why I purchased it. She didn't like it and neither did I.
1,You've got to be kidding...,"I am a fan of unique foreign films, but I'm astounded by these 5 star reviews. Being that's a retelling of a classic Greek tale, I expected an interesting story, but it's pretty much a bore from start to finish. The setting and cinematography are the only thing it has going for it. The acting is mostly theatrical and downright laughable at times, I felt like I was watching a soap opera. Unless you like seeing people dance non-stop, skip it. I haven't seen such an overrated foreign film since Fellini's ""8 1/2."""
3,Primitive is an Understatement!,"Though the information is good, it is a bit difficult to read. The print is quite primitive, almost a computer-like font. It is not easy on the eye. This is a very cheaply made publication. The drawings are almost a joke as well. They look like badly scanned or Xeroxed copies, some too light and some too dark. If you have a choice between this book and another with similar information, choose the later. I happened to get this book very cheap. I got what I paid for!"
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,THIS BOOK IS EXCELLENT READING FOR THOSE WHO PREFER OLE TIME REMEDIES OVER DOCTORS PERSCRIBING MEDICATION ALL THE TIME.. YOU WILL FIND GREAT REMEDIES FOR ALL KINDS OF THINGS. HOW TO USE HERBS AS MEDECINE AND THEIR MEDICAL PROPERTYS.. I LOVE THIS BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE
3,You Don't Need to be a Brain to play this Game!,"This toy was bought for my 7 year old who got bored with it quickly. My 4 year old did enjoy the game a bit longer, but the same 3 or 4 silly jokes that are repeated time after time get very old and my children got familiar with the 10 game pieces quickly."
3,Eh?!,"I bought this for my 5 year old for her birthday-she tried to play it with her 3 year old sister- and it is.....for a better word.... an ""alright"" game. The idea of trying to find the matching piece to your chosen card is a good idea-but somewhere along the line the thrill of the game gets lost-does not really keep them too interested in continuing with the game...find a better place to put your $21.00 bucks...maybe their piggie bank...or even a better idea-keep it in your wallet.I would not really recommend this.The original Operation game with the tweezers and buzzer that would sound off if you touched the sides, was the one that I played with as a kid(showing my age much?) I prefer the old to the new."
4,My three year old & I have fun together playing this game!,"I bought this for my three year old daughter. When we first started to play, I had her just take out the pieces from the top of his head as fast as she could before the buzzer went off. Then, I introduced the playing cards and shortly after that she caught on to the concept of matching the pieces from inside the head to the cards she had in front of her. If they didnt match, she threw them back in and quickly grabbed for the next piece. It promotes matching, turn taking and fast thinking! Since its a fast pace game, we have fun each time we play! She'll even sit and play alone sometimes but of course its more fun to play with mommy ;-D"
3,kids seem to like it OK.,"My 4 yr. old wanted this one. But when we turned it on to play it, & hit the nose timer, she freaked out, started crying, and ran to her room until we turned it off. My 3 yr. old son likes it. My daughter will only play this with the game turned off. No timer. Its an ok game, & teaches kids to concentrate & rely on something other than their sence of sight to determine what things are. I think we all would have preferred a different game. We play games daily, and I don't see this one being played very often."
3,Not much fun,"Not much fun in my opinion and I guess, my 3 year old sons. He likes reaching in the head, but that's about it. It's not educational by any means and it really has no point."
1,boring and useless,"My 4 year old wanted this toy for Christams.he played twice with it and got bored.the pieces are too easily recognized,we then put the cards in it instead of the pieces,and got more fun with it.But it is still pricy and boring."
1,This is a horrible toy,This toy is the dumbest thing ever. You reach in a head and grab stuff. I think it should be recalled because a kid could go crazy trying to grab stuff in real peoples heads. dont buy it.
1,My child is so scared of this toy,"My 2 year old saw the commercial for this toy on Nick Jr and ran out of the room screaming. Then on a trip to [a store] she saw in in the toy dept. Now everytime I go to [that store] my 2 year old keeping repeating ""we go home now"". I really think this game has scared my child"
1,bought for my 5 year old!,"I bought this for my 5 year old for Christmas and he wasn't impressed with it. He got bored with it real quick and even my 2 year old didn't seem to happy playing it. It has been sitting in the box untouched for months. Honestly I liked the old style of operation better, it does more to keep the attention of the kids where as this one is kinda boring."
1,Broken doesn't work,Game was broken and didn't work. Very disappointed. Said that the electronics worked and didn't. All parts were included but wouldn't work.
1,This game only costs 19 dollars on other sites. Ridiculous to pay that price. How dare they,My son has special needs I wanted to get it for him to play with without using the rules. His therapists bought for 19 and your charging 100
4,Great fun,"This toy is wonderful it got my 5 year old daughter and my 2 year old son playing for hours, it is one of the few games that my children agree to play toghether."
2,waiting for Dublin,Not at all what I expected. I was very disappointed this movie was more of a chick flick than a war movie.
2,Goofy and sappy movie,"Comment: Sorry... this is one of those movies that I describe as a bunch of actors got tired of acting indoors, so went outdoors and turned an indoor play into an outdoor ""goofy and sappy"" farce. Very very loosely based on facts that few people are familiar with... it just turns stupid. Pass on this one."
5,Best Bollywood Movie Ever,"If you love family, great Indian actors, fun storyline, and gorgeous colours, then, you'll love K3.I'm a huge Shahruhk and Kajol fan. And these two make this movie perfect. Add Jaya and Amitabh, Hrithic and Kareena, and you've got 3 hours of singing dancing, love, sadness, forgiveness and family.Thank you Karan, for treating us to great entertainment."
4,KKKG,wonderful-the blue ray dvd lives up to what blue ray should be but the Yash Raj ones looks like home made . do not buy Yah raj
4,Love This Movie,"This is an amazing movie. It's great to watch with a friend who hasn't seen any Bollywood before. It runs the gamut of emotions, the scenes are colorful, the songs are catchy. I will note, however, that the spelling of the subtitles is awful."
5,BEAUTIFUL FAMILY MOVIE,"I own my copy from a store I brought it from not here. Anwyays that aside, this movie is SOOOOO touching about family and the bonds we share. It goes into the depths of each character and how each one struggles to overcome and move forward in life with hope and wisdom. ITs A TEAR JERKER...so have ur hankies ready. The music is beautiful, Kajol, Shahrukh, and Amitabh are amazing in this film. Once you begin watching this, you won't be able to move away from the screen..its sooo good! I loved all the characters!! Also if it helps, if you want to buy quality indian movies try [...], and also try [...], these are pretty good n safe! some other ones I LOVE: Kuch Na kaho, 3 Idiots (5 stars) its that good!!!, Rang de Basanti, Swades, No Entry, Dil Mange More, Hum Dil de chuke sanam (my fave)...u will looove these movies, good luck!"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! BAD QUALITY AND SOUND!,"THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE WHICH I HAD SEEN ELSEWHERE. I ORDERED 2 SETS,FOR MYSELF AND BESTFRIEND. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR IN QUALITY AND SOUND IS BAD. THERE ARE OTHER MOVIES I ORDERED FROM AMAZON ALSO WHICH DO NOT HAVE GOOD QUALITY. IT'S NOT WORTH THE MONEY TO PAY FOR S/H TO RETURN. I WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THE QUALITY BEFORE PLACING MY ORDERS."
5,Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gam,"I have never seen an India movie before. I seen it because it was a birthday gift for my daughter friend and I was into the DVD just being noise. I turned it on and was looking at the move for a long time. I cried and cried it was one of the most heart warming movies I seen. If only the movie was all in English I hate sub-titles. But it is still worth looking at and I plan to get more to look at. I have a lot of India customer coming to my hair salon who tells me to look at the movie ""BAGHBAN"" I was told that movie would put me in tears also. COOL!"
5,Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham,A very emotional story. The way interweave the story and how it works out in the end. All the actors play very good roles and it shows in the way it unfolds.
3,An ok movie,"This movie was interesting enough to watch it all the way thru,but not interesting enough to watch it again."
2,good,"I saw the movie with Spanish subtitles, and the reality is that were poorly timed, poorly written besides, I think we should improve this in future products that will make films in India."
1,Be Careful When purchasing this movie. This Movie would not play.,I purchased this movie from Amazon and it would not play. It would not even play in my computer. So be careful when purchasing these movies.
1,Shallowness epitomized,"This movie epitpomizes what is wrong with the Indian society - it is blind to reality, and likes to wallow in some utopia of familial bliss. This movie is like a Mills and Boons romantic stuff ( utterly bereft of reality , and intellect, or introspection) whereas reality is more like a David Copperfield of Charles Dickens. I know I might get criticized by some people on the India Shining bandwagon for sounding like a downer, but hey stop throwing stones at the mirror which only reflects reality and I cannot help it if the reality is ugly. To watch a good Indian movioe on family life, watch the Bengali classis Meghe Dhaka Tara by Ritwick Ghatak"
2,LOVE this movie HATED the picture quality,"This was the first Bollywood movie for me and it got me HOOKED. I was thrilled when I found it on DVD here at Amazon and could finally own it and stop having to use You Tube. I was so disappointed when I got it and watched it and it was boarder line blurry. I get better picture qulaity on You Tube. I still love the story, so much I am thinking of trying to find a different copy somewhere. Thanks to Amazon for giving us access to these different types of movies."
2,I tried. I really did.,"I absolutely thought I had hit the jackpot with this one; an all star cast with my personal favorites (only Aishwarya could have made it better). I loved the first half. I was sooooo happy, and then...Pooja. Am I alone here? I really like Kareena Kapoor. I would buy a movie just because she was in it; but I guess that applies only to movies in more recent times. I held my nose through the second half hoping against hope that the director would mercifully cease and desist with the inanity that was Pooja. Her character and storyline were Alicia Silverstone's Cher on steroids. I was actually dismayed whenever she and Hrithik(!!!!!!!) appeared on screen. Oh the humanity... If you must view this simply because it is considered a ""classic"", be forewarned. Perhaps a palette cleanser of Lagaan, Rab ne bana di Jodi, Sholay, Black, Devdas, Om Shanti Om, Baazigar, or Don should be on hand to recalibrate your Bollywood senses."
4,Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham,"This was like two movies in one. This first half was fantastic! The second half was a bit cheesy, but was still fun to watch. In my opinion, Hrithik Roshan will never replace the great Shah Rukh Khan!"
3,Cost of book,"I bet it didn't cost $1,084.18 for you to buy.What a rip off price! These are not the only two copies on earth."
3,Great reading,If you have the Fire Force by Cris you need to get this one. I got my copy in Zimbabwe many years ago. And i still read it over and over. Great book
5,Insight into Disability,"I read this book many, many years ago and have always tried to obtain another copy. It was a revelation and made me think very differently about disability and disease.It is the story of Annie, a young girl with cerebal palsy. It follows her life as she is placed in an institute and the people she meets there. It gives inside information into how a mind can be trapped inside a body that is physically challenged and how a young mind can thrive and excel, even when left untended by the ignorance and apathy of outsiders.This book gave me the desire to work in the health industry. The story shines a light on the prejudice and narrow-minded thinking, which has continued well into the 20th Century.If you ever have the chance, read this story, because IT will inspire you, it will make you sad and angry and it will make you WANT to change the health system."
4,Annie's comming out,I feel that i would like to read and find some information on cerebal palsey and i find this.
2,hard padding on crutches,"The shipper sent the crutches as promised but they are very uncomfortable under my arms. The arm padding is very hard and not comfortable at all. I went back to using my old crutches which have a soft plush padding."""
1,Archaic torture device...,"Although I've never used this particular brand of aluminum crutches, the outdated A-frame design is a thing of the past. The last few years have brought monumental changes to the design of underarm crutches. I recommend Mobilegs ergonomic crutches, or similar products like Millennial Medical crutches. Speaking from personal experience."
1,A spelling nightmare - do not buy!,"The paperback version of this book is superb. That's why I bought the Kindle version - to always have it with me. However, the Kindle version must have been made in a hurry. It is so full of errors that it is completely useless as language learning material. Stay away from this version (but get the printed edition)!"
2,Not Celtic,"This is a new age / contemporary Christian album, that uses some Celtic instrumentation -- but these are not Celtic hymns."
5,Praise and glory to the Lord!,"This worship CD is exactly that, WORSHIP! This worship music does what it set out to do: bring you closer to the Lord in a state of worship. I have been a Christian for over 30 years, as a pastor as well as a leader in the church and this is one of the best worship CD's I have heard. The God-gifted worship leaders on this CD truly lead. They bring those who listen to them into a state of worship and praise of our Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you all who played and sang on this CD. I thank you with all of my heart."
1,Under Water-- This is where this video belongs,"This is the worst sailing video I have ever seen. I have 3 other videos and this is by far the least useful. It is not even worth it to describe why it so poor. If you are interested in sailing or have just begun you are better off going down to the harbor and placing this video in the water and watching it bob up and down. I rated this one star, I wish there was a 'no star' category."
2,Definitly for the beginner,"Get this if you're thinking of getting into sailing and want a half hour introduction to the sport. I learned more on my first day on the water. It contains the basics of sail control on a sailboard which, although you will feel a more direct connection with the wind and water, might confuse the new boat sailor. Although the principals are the same, there's a big difference between the two. All-in-all it's an OK introduction for the absolute beginner or land-lover."
4,great value for a well made glove,"i work with many tools and materials on the job and many times in inclement weather. i purchased these gloves for the 'gripping power' they offered and for a layer of protection. first and foremost, the g-reptile gripping material is made of a sort of rubber hair-like material that has been shaved down to produce grip. the stuff worked great until i tried to loosen a round plastic assembly by hand and the rubber dots turned into smooth rubber. but then it's really made to be mated with the 'gripping material' you are supposed to put on your tools and stuff. but as for the rest... the glove fits extremely well, is well made, looks great, is somewhat heat and weather resistant and so far hasn't lost any of its double stitched seams. the synthetic materials used are all good and placed appropriately to afford the comfort and flexibility factors. for the money i don't think i couldn've choosen a better glove."
2,Vinegar spout has a hole in it.,"I love the idea, but it was poorly constructed. I poured almost my entire bottle of olive oil into the large part of the cruet and then cleaned out the funnel so that I could pour in some balsamic vinegar. There must be a hole in the spout for the vinegar because a few drops of the vinegar somehow dripped into the olive oil when I was pouring it in. Now when I tried to pour out the vinegar all that comes out of the side spout is olive oil. I would like to just get a replacement without a hole because I really like how it looks however."
4,Oil and Vinegar Cruet,"I saw one of these while on a wine tour and it was 30.00, so I looked for one on Amazon. Although it is a smaller version, and not as sturdy, for the price, it was what I wanted. It is cute and if you put balsamic vinegar in the grape section and olive oil in the other, it really is attractive. Great to put on salads as is!"
3,Great combination,The cruet was a good size but the glass is a little thin and delicate. This takes up less room on my table and makes a great presentation to my specialty vinegars and olive oil. I look forward to using my combination vinegar and oil cruet.
3,Gift idea,"Nice quality, but disproportionate containers requiring more frequent vinegar refills compared to the oil section. Otherwise, this is a handy server for dressing individual salads."
3,Nice but very fragile,"I have to returned the first one because came shattered inside the box.The second one came in one piece but when I went to pour the vinegar inside the grape, there was a leak into the oil compartment."
1,Save yourself the aggravation.......,"When I picked up the package from my front step I could hear the sound of glass--not a good sign. Sure enough, the inner grape part (where the vinegar would be stored) had broken off in shipment. This is a very delicate item. I was purchasing this as a replacement for one I bought in a vineyard in California. I broke that one myself by dropping it--again, the inner grape part broke off. I was hoping to buy a replacement because this is such a neat looking cruet. We had no problem bringing it home from California in a suitcase but apparently companies cannot be trusted to be as careful."
3,Not his Thing,"My 5 month old son doesn't seem to like this toy. I think it's a little too heavy for him and he has a hard time hanging on to it, especially when decides to shake it around and it flies out of his hand. Perhaps another toy I'll put away and bring out later when he's a little older. It is however, put together well."
2,demented cricket,Within 3 weeks it began to squeak like a demented cricket. The fireplace and blower have been installed for less than a month and the fan is driving me insane.
1,Ridiculously Bad,"I can't begin to try to understand what this thing is supposed to be.I'll start by saying I love the music of Michael Kamen and I own this CD so I knew the music. I'm into finding concert works by film composers. This piece is mostly kind of like soft jazz meets film music. It's not that good music-wise but that wasn't so important. I was dying for a concert video.This is not a concert video. This is like a badly done music video where you see Kamen ""conducting"" a handful of musicians, NOT a full symphony- but in the middle of a circle. Not from a podium...no audience.All the while we are bombarded with totally unrelated random footage of cars in traffic. This seems like some clueless record executive trying to make something like Koyaanisqatsi.Somewhere towards the end, there's kind of cheesy romantic melody and the video turns Into a kind of soft-core porn. It's all so comically bad. It's so bad I'll probably hold onto it because it's so messed up a creation."
1,pass,"It sounds the same as all the rest of his albums... He's trying to get away with attempting to copy the simplistic genius sound of artists like Cat Stevens, who use simple, usually major chords, and repeat quite a bit, but eLi can't pull it off. If you're thinking about buying this CD, save your money and buy a Cat Stevens album. Only a few of the songs have decent lyrics. eLi either needs to find originality and his own style, or give it up already."
2,This is for astronomy history buffs only!,"I was acquiring several space science and basic astronomy texts for my Kindle, so I could update my lesson plans as a high school teacher. In my haste to select a few good titles, I stumbled on this one, was dazzled by the modernistic cover and title, and downloaded it without realizing it is a 100 year old text! It ismay be of great historical interest, but I wasn't really aware that I was getting an ""archive"" volume of something! Be sure you know what you're getting if you are considering this book!"
1,"DO NOT BUY! seller ships ""equivalent"" product instead of PA-5D","WARNING! The seller is NOT selling a PA-5D but the PA-150Yamaha PA150MM Keyboard AC Power Adapter. Yamaha says the PA-150 replaced the PA-5D so it should work. However Imagine-This also sells the PA-150 for $14.89 so he's just trying to rip people off. Sleezy way of doing business. I wouldn't have been quite as disappointed but its cord is shorter than the PA-5D and the price difference. Seller imagine-this didn't refund shipping. The PA-5D however is a good power bar, it served me well for years and many many trips between my house and church before it broke."
4,A must,"Recently, several, straight-forward books which provide a superlative guide for evangelical (protestant) churches have been written and this is one of them. No ivory tower prof writes this short, every-day language set of essays. Pastor Mark Dever's authority comes not from his doctorate but from his fruit in his own church from which experiences this book is drawn. A must read, along with Rainer's Simple Church and Dever's A Healthy Church for all who would reform the local church to biblical orthodoxy for the glory of God and the joy of His children."
1,Horrible Glove,"I bought the newer version of these gloves, the ICON series. Suppose to be so much better. This is an absolute honest statement: In 3 hours of just moving pavers around,not picking them up and placing them, I wore through 3 fingers. The molded rubber is EXTREMELY horrible and peals off easily. The HEAVY Duty gloves last much longer. Let me say this though: the layout of the glove is cool. I like how it prevents debris from going into the glove with the exception of the holes in the fingers. I was very excited when I got them but you get the point."
2,Free Book at Mosque,"I got my copy free at a Mosque. Well written by a Christian Apologist for Islam.He has on p58 ""God does not forgive for associating something with him; He forgives anything beside that. Anyone who gives God associates has indeed invented an awful offense"" Quran 4:46 and this will be punished on the p54 ""Day of Retribution and Wrath"" [contrast with 'Day of Judgement'], but does not explain it.Thus praying to Jesus is a moral sin in Islam, while John 3:16 says ""For God so loved the world that he gave his only son...""The book has a useful description of Holidays and religious practices, but be wary when he discusses 'misunderstandings'.His other books ""Kasmir, Happy Valley, death Valley"" and ""Theft of a Nation"" slander Hindus and Jews."
4,Great Driving Music!,"I first heard about this band on a PS2/GC game ""Big Mutha Truckers"". The song ""Sun Is Shining"" is featured in the game. Unfortunately, the other featured song ""Unexperienced(I wish you could be), ISN'T included on this cd.:o( But, this cd is REALLY worth getting if you like techno-funky-dance music, that is great to listen to while on the road. Check out the songs on the game! Either one is a GREAT buy! I'm glad I got it."
2,Not good,"Although the dictionary seems to be extensive, its lack of information on noun declensions is a hindrance for mastering Old English. There are indications for the groups into which each verb falls, but there is no information on whether a noun is strong or weak. I have been very disappointed, and often find myself having to use the internet to learn about the proper inflections for almost every noun I want to learn. I bought the dictionary so I would not have to sit in front of a computer."
1,SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FREE SPAM DVD,"This is such a horrible rip off, All you see on this video is like 30 seconds of each attraction, with horrible background music, there's not a play all button, it's very annoying to go back to the menu for only a 30 second clip, not to mention it's all advertising, nothing very entertaining about it, SANTA BARBARA is such a beautiful place, the idea of this DVD was good, but delivered poorly, I wanted my family to see the place I live in, I'll have to do a video myself. I want my money back!"
2,A Little Lacking,"For my State & Local Taxation Class it was only helpful for the first 3 weeks as a supplement to all the constitutional law cases. And then we didn't even cover the stuff in the 2nd half of the book. So while it was a nice, general, overview and I liked the size (small/easy to handle), and it was easy to read; For my purposes, I wish it were more detailed, like an Emmanuels Outline."
3,"Nice, but Bulky","Light Quality: Good! Ease of Cranking to Power LIght: Easy!Best Feature: It's waterproof!! Worst Feature: bulky to hold in your hand. Confusion Factor: Box that it is packaged in says it is a Dynamo flighlight w/ Mobile Phone Charger...but there is no place to plug in a cell phone! (This feature was not mentioned in the Amazon listing)Overall: Prefer my other flightlight, a Viatek Dynabrite Flashlight."
4,crank flashlight,"great product for emergencies, can even use a cell phone with it, bright light, very little cranking needed for effect."
5,Bit of a treat.,"From Australia, where I've never read of problems from. Pricey, but worth it. Add to food for eating incentive, if needed. Or just a treat. Fab."
4,A pleasant salt with a mellow mineral taste.,"I like this salt, but it is very coarse, so you need a very agressive grinder of a mortar and pestal to use it for the table."
3,"One of Van dammes best movies, tough action","I love this movie, It had a great story and Van Damme has some great scenes in it. The fighting is legendary, and the final scene is trademark Van Damme. The grimace and fire is intense."
2,GOOD STRATEGY,"Van DAmme knows his real market in the videos, not in the theaters. Because, when you're wasting your time at home with nothing to do, a good-old action movie is a good choice, not having to ""think"", just enjoy the action sequences. THis movie does its function well."
5,Highly desired by golden women !!,My aunt 88 years old requested this as a gift. She love this movie. Wish she would upgrade to DVD..LOL
3,"A LITTLE MEDIOCRE AT FIRST, BUT GIVE IT SOME TIME","A COP [VAN DAMME] IS ASSIGNED TO POSE AS A NEW INMATE AT A PRISON TO INVESTIGATE THE REASONS BEHIND A SERIES OF MURDERS THAT'RE HAPPENING AT THE PRISON. IT STARTS OUT KINDA BORING, BUT AFTER A WHILE, IT GETS BETTER. THIS MAY NOT RANK AMONGST THE BEST MOVIES THAT VAN DAMME HAS DONE, BUT IT IS A LOT BETTER THAN MANY OF THE VAN DAMME MOVIES THAT'VE CAME OUT IN RECENT YEARS. IT'S WORTH RENTING IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN THIS."
2,A LITTLE BETTER THAN VAN DAMME'S COSTUMARY TRASH,This is a good movie if you wanna se Van Damme and ignore all the holes in the plot.
3,Entertainment Warrant,"Jean-Claude Van Damme's martial arts extravaganza is bolstered by some fine editing, a dark, scary soundtrack, and some mighty fine camera work. Despite some B-level acting (except for Robert Guillaume as a supply doling inmate) director, Deran Sarafian, keeps the whole affair rolling along well enough to provide some key suspenseful moments. The plot involves police investigator, Louis Burke (Van Damme), who becomes a mole in prison while investigating a deadly crime ring while the elusive ""Sandman"" lurks in the background with nine-lives more reminiscent of Michael Myers than a super criminal. Although this element breaks up the film's credibility somewhat, it ups the tension as well. In the end 'Death Warrant' is a lively hour and a half movie that has enough going for it to make you forget its weaknesses.A J.P.'s Pick 3's = Good"
4,Van Damme takes it to a whole new level...,"If you would of said Van Damme back in 1990,people would of responded he was in Bloodsport or Kickboxer which were simply martial art type of films.Van Damme stepped up to the level with Schwarzenegger and Stallone in this box-office hit.Even though jail movies have been done before like Stallones ""Lockup"" and Sean Penn's ""Bad Boy's"" Death Warrant took it into overtime,having a convincing villian in the ""Sandman"" and a believing hero in Van Damme.An undercover cop in jail?Dangerous if you ask me but Van Damme fights the odds and comes up victorious in an all out supercharged war.With fast pace kicks and fight sequences Van Damme is your ticket to nonstop action..."
4,Up the Irons,"As a longtime afficianado of the Van Damme oeuvre, I can honestly say that this film does right by the requisite cliches (where prison movies are concerned), and is actually not bad for repeated viewings.Similar in pace to Stallone's ""Lock-Up"" and slightly less entertaining, but still pretty good, ""Death Warrant"" gets higher marks than it should because of the action (well-choreographed until the climax, which is stricly by-the-numbers Van Damme signature moves), the moody lighting and production accuracy, and Robert Guillaume and Patrick Kilpatrick as the veteran inmate and omnipotent nemesis, respectively.Van Damme still had a few films to go before he reached his peak, but this was a step in the right direction."
2,Ponderous and needlessly unpleasant.,"Now Jean Claude Van Damme is an action superstar,I should imagine he's probably desperate to write stuff like this off his CV. Death Warrant is an admittently entertaing,but soporific and unpleasantly violent affair,told with very little conviction."
2,Another Van Damme punchfest,"Jean-Claude is at it again as a cop who goes undercover in the prison system to investigate a plot involving corruption among the cell guards.The film heats up when Van Damme's arch-rival, a psychopathic killer who for some reason, which is never explained, can withstand bullets and other fatal moves, shows up at the prison and exposes him as an undercover cop.If you're in for Van Damme, you know what to expect though this is a lot slower and less action-filled than a lot of his other features."
5,Lifechanging...,"Simply put, Eden's Bridge, their hearts, and their music have blessed my life to an inexpressible extent. I thank God for Eden's Bridge."
5,Marvelous songs!,I have listened Celtic Psalm very far from my home at Nepal. I was just listening all cassetes belonging to a indian brother member from our Church when I listened that record. I was very pleased. I have got a copy and brought to Sydney (Australia). Since I got here I have listened almost every day in my car and home. I have called - The better gospel cassete that I have heard in 2000. It's really spiritual music. It is not worldly music gospel. I strongly recomend. Congratulations Sarah for your gifted voice. May God bless you all.
5,Another Awesome Celtic Inpirational Endeavor By Eden Bridge,"Since I have discovered the group, Eden's Bridge, I have been on a quest to obtain their whole catalog of released CD's. ""Celtic Psalms"" is one of my most recent purchases.Their sound gives you a soothing celtic ambiance, through music and singing. It is inspirational and reflective. It just takes you to ANOTHER place than where you are physically.The track ""El Shaddai"" is my favorite (although I have NO dislike tracks on this cd). The inspiration and beauty of the piece actually sends chills through me.I can't say nearly enough in the praise for the group Eden's Bridge. I think they are the most AWESOME Christian Celtic group I have heard. I would love to be fortunate sometime in life to see them perform live.I know there are some Eden's Bridge fans out there as I reviewed another one of their cd's and have read your reviews. If you haven't bought this cd...don't sit on the fence about it! Buy it! Enjoy it!"
4,Celtic Psalms,Where has this group (Eden's Bridge) been hiding ? I am so impressed with their ability to capture the solemn and beautiful words of the Psalms. Beautifully done and spirtually moving.
5,Simply Excellent,The Lord has sure blessed them and I'm glad they're using their blessing to share the Word with us.
4,Protect your hands,"These gloves work very well in protecting your hands from wood splinters and dust. I got these gloves because the wood dust was completely drying out my hands and with these gloves I don't have to worry about. Unlike traditional leather gloves, you don't have to remove these gloves to do small work - I can write, pick up screws, etc.. without taking off my gloves.I gave them four stars instead of five because after three months of heavy use some of the stitching is coming off. At this point it is mostly cosmetic but I worry about the long run."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this book. I had hoped the pictures would be a memory aid. They are not very good and only cover a few things.Not worth the money. Sorry I purchased it.
3,"Just ""okay""",I am a visual learner and had high hopes for these memory notebooks. They just did not do the trick for me. I found it much more helpful to make my own silly illustrations to remember key points.
4,Memory Notebooks,"Overall good review with a few helpful tips and tricks. They would have helped more had I gotten them earlier in school. I discovered these products(I have to series) too late to help much on my NCLEX, but I still passed!"
4,Nice Strap,"This is a very nice strap, and the idea of a design that is a tribute to SRV is the thing that caught my eye, and got me to buy it. However, this is not at all like the one SRV actually wore. It is a different kind of strap altogether. It is inaccurate to say this strap is ""just like the one SRV wore"", for example, because it is not. The artwork on this strap is reminiscent of the artwork on SRV's straps (one of which was black with white notes and one of which was white with black notes, as this one is). Priced as other straps of this style, but a little better in that it has the nice artwork, and not just a plain leather strap."
5,The Real Thing-Big Tent Revival,"This was a definite change for the better. The band's third album showed a lot more edge and musical improvement. The lyrics of the CD were equally deft and memorable. This rock oriented CD demonstrates the band's growth and willingness to explore their music.Everything from the blues to ballads was explored. The after-credit tracks rock!!! Emphasizing a real walk with Christ the album does not disappoint.I especially liked the credits on Track 11, this is not a CD for a lazy day,but more like a fast drive down a hot Texas highway!!!"
5,Gourmet recipes for very healthy meat,"I cannot disagree more with the previous reviewer. I've found this book to be a wonderful addition to my collection. I have made many of the recipes in the book and can attest to their excellent results. While some of the ingredients might be difficult to find in rural areas, any decent sized city with a well-stocked grocery store should have most everything listed in the book. We've especially enjoyed the Ziti tapenade-chevre, Pesto Pasta with grilled buffalo sausage and the Four roasted pepper, bean and shredded bison burrito grande (the only way I make burritos now)."
5,Absolutely terrific and true to the show!!! ^^,"You'll feel like you're in an episode of the wonderific Yu-Gi-Oh! anime as you play one of four characters: Yugi, Joey, Kaiba, and Mai Valentine! You collect Duel Monsters cards, battle in the Arena, and try to win all the pieces of the Millennium Puzzle (hence the name of the game)! I just luv, LUV this game!! ^^ It's a must-have for every YGO fan!!!"
2,disapointed nephew,"this game was a gift to my nephew aged 6, he grew tired and frustrated as the instructions i received in the box was a half a page long and had no real help at all! sentences like, and i quote: ""the other cards put over there"" with no diagrams of any sort, how did i know where ""over there"" was for all i know it could have been on my head! the game is okay when you realise how to play it but i would be firing the instruction writer, and telling him to learn how to make sense, if he knows english! to people interested, seek further instruction on the internet, and good luck"
1,"complicated, but its yugi!","My kid loves everything Yugi, so whileI did not think this game was fun or easy to learn... he loved it right away. It has a weird tray to hold the parts and many different shape and size cards in box, but it is too small for the cards. So it is hard to pack up and makes a mess when you open it. The figures are nice and look like the show. And most important for kids, it has the Millenium puzzle."
1,What were they thinking?,"My child just turned 7,, and is a big Yughio fan. We got this for Christmas for him, and sad to say we could not get thru the instruction. We ended up making up our own rules. Quite disappointing."
5,millenium puzzle!!!!!,its cool because you can get your very own 5 peice millenium puzzle. its small and is hard not a big fat plush one. all you have to do is drill a hole in the top peice stick a chain or string and wear it. tada your own millenium puzzle!!!!
1,Not that great,"Sure it looks cool at first, but when I bought this a couple years ago, the game was too complicated and boring, trust me, don't by this unless you like this sort of thing."
2,don't like the story,"I've read this to a number of 4 year olds - and they all get bored. Personally, I find the story of the difficult puppy annoying and negative. If a parent is hoping to turn a young person off who wants a puppy, but the adult does not, this is a great book to read. I find myself changing the story, just so it's not such a bummer.I'm tossing it."
5,Love Doreen Tovey,"Tovey's books are some of the funniest that I have read, and sometimes some of the saddest. Loved her first books about Solomon and Sheba. SHe is truly missed!"
4,A Real Good Sound,I like their music. It's obvious they love God. If you want something with a poignant message -- listen to scarecrow.
5,This band cooks!,"I saw Skillet at a small concert in Bangor, Me, and only knew a few of their songs at the time. I immediately beccame a fan and bought this CD a few weeks later. This is a good mix of styles and, other than the order the songs come in, I wouldn't change a thing. Great CD overall!"
4,Not asa good as the first,"It was a good cd, it just wasn't as hard rock as the first. That dissapointed me a little but for all you techno fans out there this is a great cd for you!"
4,Out of the Fire and into the Frying pan,"The lyrics skillet uses in this cd is captivating. They express thier faith by music that is a unique blend. They have nice rock sound, but the lead singer sounds a little soft, you have to listen to the cd a couple of times to understand what he is saying, but that shouldn't be a problem the cd rocks. This cd is recommended for anyone, even those who don't know Christ."
5,This is the best c.d. you'll ever buy!,"I have never bought(or listened to for that matter) a Christian c.d. My friend invited me to a Christian lock-in where Skillit was performing. They were absolutely amazing! I have never had so much fun at a concert in my life. I bought the c.d. right then and there, and it has replaced groups like Everclear and Third Eye Blind in my stereo. Who knew that Christian music could be so awesome?"
5,This CD ROCKS HARD!!!!!,"If you like alternative music, You're going to love this CD. Don't miss out. It is very inspirational. The lead singer has the most unique voice that I have ever heard. Honest!!!"
4,"Before Invincible, there was Hey You.","Hey You I Love Your Soul came out in 1998. I love this album because you can see the evolution of the band combining Rock, Techno and a Ballad all within one song. With HYILYS they are almost there. The effect they create makes a non-techno fan go from Huh? to Wow! No sound bit can give you a hint of what the song is really about, because each song is a journey through sounds, feelings and verses that grab you. I like this album because you see where were going in the Album before their monster INVINCIBLE.Invincible gets it absolutely right for me. The mix of a subtler techno with rock, its time changes combined with the entire structure of the album makes for one of the best albums I have ever heard in any genre. Invincible is the must have album but if you like a little more techno (some say a lot more) mixed with rock, you will enjoy Hey You.."
3,"This has some great songs, but not enough.","Why do people beleive that Christians can't roack as hard as everyone else? I'm a Christian and I bang my head to Korn, Metallica, Misfits, and the occaisional Manson. (This is not a theological debate, so if anyone asks how I can be a Christian and like a couple of Manson's songs, I will have my non-Christian friends ""Explain"" it too you). Anyway, Pop is not Rock. Pop should not be able to get within 100 miles of ROck. Skillet's first album is better, but get this one just for the title cut."
1,Not worth the money,This book seems hopelessly out of touch with Black culture and US culture in general. It also seems to be pandering to people who want to believe the Nation of Islam is not different than Hitler and the Nazis! How simplistic! If you really want to understand race and how to do away with racism give this book a pass.
3,Forgotten but not Gone,"Old Hippies never die...they just flash back. I mean, how much can you milk out of a band whose only redeemable song was ""On The Cover Of The Rolling Stone?"" (In all honesty, the ""lead guitar solo"" on that song is almost the greatest guitar solo of the 70's, surpassed ONLY by Ariel Bender's solo on Mott The Hoople's ""The Golden Age Of Rock And Roll."") Where is a Musikladen Mott The Hoople concert DVD, eh?"
4,Teaspoon,"I bought this as a potential replacement (or rather to add to) my set for which i cannot get any more pieces. It is similar to what I have. It is well made and looks nice, however I find that the handle is a touch shorter than I expect it to be and is quite narrow. So even though I need more I am undecided as to wheter I should buy more or not."
4,Excellent product!,I am happy with it. It helps to keep a back support to relieves stress to your back. Excellent!!!. Comfort and support.
1,Useless and was not Fellowes brand,"When this item arrived, it was not the Fellowes brand, it was some no name brand. Nonetheless, it does not provide any support for my back and does not even stay up on my office chair. Thankfully it was inexpensive so I don't feel so bad that I bought this."
1,don't waste your money or time,This item sucks ....I tried my friend's one (which she said was only $2) and it was so comfortable. I saw this and thought it was the same product but its obviously not. I'm very petite and only 105 lbs....I can barely feel the support on my back. I would return it but its so cheap that there's no point in going through the trouble. Don't waste your time or money. I would give no stars if I could.
1,Just Not Good,This back rest does not stay in place on the chair. I spend half my day adjusting this thing as it slips all over the place. It is cheap and does not provide good support. The mesh gives too much so you sink into the chair back anyway. Spend a little extra and get one with better support.
4,Great Product,Received this product very quickly. Very comfortable and provides great support. My only concern is that the one strap on the back does cause it to slide around a little bit. Not so much that it isn't usable. It just needs some adjusting throughout the day.
1,Too Soft!,"I have a desk job and needed something to give the small of my back some support. I spent about a half hour trying to get the support into a good position and have come to the conclusion that the material is simply too flexible to offer the kind of support I was hoping for. Perhaps it was the combination of chair and the back support, but this product was essentially useless to me."
5,Excellent,I was very amazed the item arrived so quick. I'm happy with the product. This will stop me from sweating my back on the leather seat.
1,"Poor support, not worth it.","I was expecting this lumbar support to actually do what it says - support my lower back in my work chair. However, the material is flexible, so when you lean back on it, it goes back with you. Not very supportive! I gave it to a co-worker, and she had to ball up her jacket and stick it between the chair and this back support for it to even remotely begin to help. You might as well save your money and find an old blanket to put behind you in your chair instead of buying this."
4,I use this at home,Provides decent lower back support. The mesh material is great for air to circulate.
3,Too wide,"I like this product, however it is too wide to use comfortably. I realize this may be that most users in the market (America) are, on average, larger than myself. However, if you are slim, I don't recommend it, as it makes an uncomfortable ridge where you arms hang down."
5,"Held up great for 4 months or so, still usable","200# sitting on it day in and day out has flattened it a bit, but I still use it. Great for hotter weather to get some air on your back in a leather chair."
4,Back support,"Excellent buy, works very well if you have a sensitive back to any kind of pressure. Worth the money **"
2,Minimal Suport,Item almost didn't fit my chair in my office. It provides just a small amount of support when more was need and expected.
1,I just got similiar one for $1!!!,"I just got similiar one at dollar store for yes $1!!! Also, saw at Target for $1!!! Thought I would try the Good Karma thing and pass it along!!!"
2,Can't tell it helps any,This is a waist of money. I was hoping to have back support .... But my back is still up against the chair.
3,just okay,"shipping was astronomical. stand portion arrived rusted in sections and scratched, it looked like someone had already used it and left it outside in the rain. the bucket portion is meant to slide on and off, which could be useful if you just want to use the bucket on a table, but i don't know how you would put it on the stand without scratching the side of the bucket. it's a lot cheaper compared to the other wine buckets, so i suppose this is an example of getting what you pay for."
5,Romantic fun time,Sent as a gift to a friend who was proposing and wanted to be able to hang around the fireplace...he loves it!
2,Not Much of A Balance Board,The bottom that provides the balance is several inches in diameter and is nearly flat. Not much of a balance board. I believe I will return this one.I recommend the gofit for $10 more. I had one but my son took it to college.
3,bored with this,"I got the knack of balancing on this quickly so I need some more serious exercises to get a core workout from this. I was hoping the bottom would be completely unstable so anytime you wanted to stand on it, you'd have to use your core to balance.I have tried to do pushups on it (as shown on the picture) but it is too narrow for my shoulders - and I am a medium size female, so I doubt it will work at all for male figures.I guess getting this with a workbook would be OK but I am less than thrilled for this especially given that it is not too cheap."
3,Super cheap and it looks it,"Purchased this a a wardrobe piece for a film so it doesn't get worn every day. For a film, it looks good enough but it's a fairly cheap quality buckle for everyday use. The black paint is sloppy, bleeding out on to the areas that should be silver but, for the price, you can't really complain. No problems with the shipping and it arrived quickly."
4,Useful & Recommended,"My family traveled to Key West in April and we bought the DVD before we left. It was less a guide and more of a good overview of the island with great imagery, local music and a well-written voiceover.We did find a lot of the places on the DVD and felt we had a more informed vacation after watching and learning about Key West on this DVD."
4,"Informative, entertaining look at Key West","I bought this DVD while on a visit to Key West recently and wished I had seen it before I left on my trip. I found out it was produced by local professionals, and you can tell because it contains no silly ads or commercial content. Just carefully-selected, beautiful scenery of the island, the reefs, aerial stuff...and great interviews throughout with some truly colorful Key Westers. Captain Outrageous could only live, and ""work"", in Key West! Nice work!"
1,Boring & Outdated,This DVD is one of the most boring I ever seen. It is dated and the individuals interviewed throughout the DVD have zero personality and enthusiasm. Definitely doesn't do a very good job of making Key West a possible exciting destination to visit. Better off with a current Frommer's Travel Guide.
4,Hillarious humour meets sensitivity,"Ben Elton's humour is great. In this book, though he manages to bring tears of laughter, frustration and sorrow. It was a real pleasure reading the book as it showed the human side of a common problem shared by many. Besides which, it also managed to teach me quite a few new English expressions! Brilliant Work!"
3,Light reading,"My wife read this book and then suggest I should as she thought is was funny. This is absolutely not an area I ever read books on so I was very sectional. Well the book did have some funny spots, it is also interesting for an American to read about like in the UK. The characters are light and easy to know - much like the story. This is not a deep read, just a light fun book that couples ""trying"" will probably enjoy."
5,another awesome brit,"read everything you can get your hands on, he is hard to find in the states too. his writing is witty and deep at the same time. brilliant."
4,Hilarious and then it hits you,"A friend of mine wanted to introduce me to Ben Elton's works, and so I told her to try lending me his funniest to see if it appealed to MY sense of humour! And it did! It was so funny I couldn't help chuckling to myself almost as soon as I started reading it at the bus-station. Throughout the trip, it kept me engrossed both with its humour- the poking-of-fun at the various DIY methods of trying to conceive. But as the story unfolded, I realized there was more to the story than its hilarity. It was also about a long-term marriage and its extra-marital temptations and taken-for-grantedness. The climax was heart-wrenching, even though briefly written. The ending seemed too pat for my liking. It was as if Elton had quickly stepped onto the humour track again after a sojourn into more emotional land. Still, he has managed the humour wonderfully in a very real situation."
2,Pretty thin gruel.,"You gotta really really love irish esoterica to find something here. Sure Man of Aran is a myth, of sorts. Sure its and early film and uses a new technique for the times here and there. But that's it.Suggest you focus your viewing efforts on ""I Know Where I'm Going"" on DVD. Scotland, not Ireland. But much more fun and still Gaelic infused."
4,And I thought we were poor when I was a kid...,"Black and white docudrama of what it was like to scrape a living off the barren coastal islands of Ireland. Story is scarce, sound is almost indecipherable, but if you watch the actors, (locals hired for the film,) they wade waist deep into the icy Atlantic breakers without even flinching, it's an every day thing for them to risk their lives to gather a torn net or pull a boat through the huge waves, just to glean enough to keep their stomach full. I was on Aran, recognized some of the settings, life is tremendously better, now, but you see why they still consider someone not of the island families an outsider, no matter how long they've lived there."
1,Is this for a 12 pack?,Someone mistyped the price and no one has caught it!A 50 sheet page is $4.95 from logitech.com.Someone please correct the price or the quantity.
3,Better to have it and not need it.,"I bought this about a year ago for where I was living at the time. It didn't seem to help. When I moved in my new place and tried it, I have not had to deal with anything other than a couple occasions with ants. So its probably one of those products to get it before you need it."
2,It won't work for mosquitoes!,"Bought this thinking it would keep mosquitoes away from my room, but it didn't work. And the noise is very annoying, even when it is on quiet. Don't buy it!"
1,"Jeez, I can't believe these things are still for sale","There oughta be a law.I can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere)."
1,Note no mention in the description about how loud it actually is to humans,"I bought this, looking for a humane way to keep mice out of our office. As soon as I plugged it in I thought something was wrong. It was so loud! I looked and found it on the highest setting. Moving it to medium didn't help and even on the lowest setting, I couldn't tolerate it longer than one hour. I would be very concerned about long term hearing damage and I am returning mine today."
3,Rodent update,"Living in the desert we do have a problem with critters. Several pack rats keep trying to live on our patio (I don't like to kill - just don't want them here.) So far it seems to be working, but it is quite loud and I run it only at night. The instructions say for indoor use (but our patio is covered.) I wouldn't want the noise inside."
1,Big box-little help,I've had this for over a year-mice/rats just ignore it; makes an annoying sound for humans but doesnot seem to effect the rats. I would save your money and try something else.
3,Ineffective for mice,"I haven't seen any cockroaches in my apt. since I bought the device, but I have continued to have mice. I don't think this device works. It's also really noisy. Not worth the money."
2,Way too LOUD,"Bought this product to ""discourage"" squirrels in my attic. The setting for large rodents is ear piercing. Nothing about this is ultrasonic. It's so loud I can't use it. It could be heard all throughout the house (even though I placed it in the attic) and even outside.However, I did use this in my basement for discouraging spiders. This setting is non-audible and seemed to work."
2,Very loud,"This product is very loud on the rodent setting. I even tried the next setting down which is rodent/insect but I could hear it 10 feet outside of my garage with the door completely closed. Because I didn't want the neighbors to complain, I had to turn it down to the lowest setting which is for insects. However, I bought this to resolve a mouse issue. Not sure what I will do at this point."
4,Works Great So far,"I bought this to get rid of the squirrels that take up residence in my attic every winter. The thought of traps (and having to ""off"" them once I caught them) was not appealing. I've heard a few squirrels in the attic since installing it, but they don't stay long, so I hope they get the message and don't come back. The device is smaller than it looks in the picture, a little bigger than a soda can. It has three sound levels, and all but the quietest do make noise. We cannot hear it on the medium setting in the house though unless it is very quiet. So far I am very happy with it."
1,"Wothless, Worthless, Worthless",Deployed in motorhome during winter months. No food of any type stored in motorhome. Set unit on tile floor to maximize obnoxious sound emitted by this unit. Opened all cabinets to eliminate anything hindering sound wave propogation. Field mice started eating a bar of soap two feet away from this unit. This product is a joke and is not recommended to anyone (except one wishing to throw money away!)
1,not a durable product,"Based on previous reviews, I purchased this to try to get rid of a pesky raccoon. No luck there. Sadly, the unit stopped working on the high setting after using it for less than a week. I would not recommend this for purchase."
2,Noisy,"I got the unit a few days ago and set it up in my garage. In the past, it appears that the field mice have been entering my house in the winter through the garage, so it made sense to install it there. I found the unit loud and annoying, but it didn't seem to affect any of my dogs on the first floor. Unfortunately, on the third day, I actually saw a field mouse run into the garage when I opened the garage door, so the unit doesn't seem to keep field mice out. Hopefully the mouse (mice) will leave because the unit is so annoying. I have also ordered an Attack Wave Pestrepeller which may also help."
1,Useless on rats!,"For a product that claims to repel rats to not actually do so is called ""false advertising"". I bought the EP1100-A because we have a rat problem in the winter and before I fix all the ""entrances"" I wanted to evict the current residences in a humain way. Guess I'll have to do it the old fashion way and close the entrances and then use rat traps to kill the remaining rats."
1,B&D Sonic Noisemakert,"Purchased the B&D Ultrasonic Pest Repeller to try to chase squirrels from the attic. Unfortunately the repeller was not ""ultrasonic"". It let off a loud audible noice that could be hear from the attic into the bedrooms. Although the noise did not keep us from sleeping, it did not seem to have any effect on the squirrels, either. In fact it seeems that the one we had heard brought his family into the attic to join him. Based upon reading other product reviews, it seems that these sonic and ultrasonic repellers are not effective. I would recommend not expecting these types of products to be helpful for keeping pests away."
3,Happy with seller,"A customer had purchased one of these years ago, but the volume control went bad so he needed a new one.The Amazon seller had the best price I could find, so I'm happy with the purchase.I'm not quite sure WHY these are called ""ultrasonic"" since they're clearly audible? It's actually a fairly piercing sound (esp. at the ""loud"" setting),and neighbors have even complained about the annoying ""noise""."
1,Not ultrasonic,"I'm not sure by what definition this unit was labeled ultrasonic, but it is clearly and very annoyingly audible to both humans and dogs. As soon as I plugged it in and heard the racket, it went back into the box and back to Amazon."
1,Ultrasonic? Really?,"The description about this device is very deceptive. If you are looking for a device that pests can hear but that you can't you will be very disappointed. I sent the first device I ordered back because I thought it was defective when it made a really loud audible noise. The second one I got was the same. If you put this in your attic and set it for rodents, you will hear it in your living space."
5,It Worked for Me!,"The product worked at the middle setting to rid our attic of squirrels. The low setting did not fix the problem and the high setting was too loud for us to sleep. We tried the smaller, plug in products offered in the big box stores and in my opinion they do not work so this is product to go with for sure."
2,Didn't work for me!,I purchased this unit because I read the good reviews and thought I would give it a try for my problem with squirrels. Each year squirrels nest the in same spot above my living room ceiling in my attic. I had an A/C outlet installed in my attic near the nest (about 10 ft away) and installed this pest repeller. I set the pest switch to insects/rodents and the volume to medium initially for about a week and left it on 24/7. The squirrels were not deterred. I changed the settings to rodents and loud and even installed it on a timer so that it would only come on at night since the loud setting can be heard in the living room and adjacent kitchen. After several weeks of use the squirrels are still there. I wish I could return it as it doesn't work for the squirrels in my attic. I am past the 30 days return period. I guess I can try it on insects and see if it keeps the roaches away that are outside on the back deck!
1,Pest Repeller,"The noise is unbearable. I don't know how they can advertise this as something you could use in the house. I have put it outside in my jeep with all the windows rolled up and you can still hear it. It does however seem to be keeping the rats out of my jeep, which is what I bought it for."
1,This does NOT work.,"I've had this thing plugged in and set to rid the rodents AND insects for 8 weeks now. The mouse in my house ate some poison and died a slow death in the bathroom, but there are spider webs ON the Pest Repeller. How much repelling is it actually doing? Looks like none; I am very disappointed. I gave it one star but it deserves none. Sidenote: its very loud. A garage or living room would be better suited for a place to use this...but it doesn't even work so nevermind, ya know? SMH."
2,overbearing and not the best dysfunctional family drama,"Spanning 1 hour at 20 minutes this movie feels much longer and not necessarily in a pleasant way. Although some of the subjects and explorations this movie takes are genuine and interesting, there's too much of the oddity in here to be truly appreciated. This is not the best dysfunctional family drama out there and, by the end of the film, nor do we really care about whether it is."
2,"Classic Structure, Mediocre Content","I love Matthew Perry, but he needs someone to help him pick better films. I like films about dysfunctional families, but this movie was a sub-par example of the genre. This movie had the elements of a promising film but the content of the scenes was not clever, humorous, or perceptive enough. (Though there is one scene that sticks in my memory involving smoking marijuana that I thought was authentic/original/cool.)Instead of this, if you haven't seen it, see The Safety of Objects, a film that my subconscious keeps returning to months after seeing it."
3,5 Star film 3 star DVD,"This is without a doubt my favorite Chuck Norris flick. The film also stars the late great Lee Marvin as Colnel Nick Alexander. The film is loosely inspired by a 1985 hijacking that much I know (I was only 7 when it happened). The film has a ""happy"" ending but I do think that the film is overly long at 2HRS 8MINS. The dvd is lacking in a widescreen format (only fullscreen) the region 2 dvd is widescreen No subtitles only English but only when the baddies are speaking Arabic?? I think they also translated the tower when the plane was hijacked so the subtitles for that are a plus. The sound is a little soft in places. MGM need to remaster this it is a good dvd that replaces my old worn out vhs video but there is room for improvment. The bike and dune buggies were cool too I want one. I got Delta Force for under $10 so I'm happy as pie oh the music by Alan Silvestri is one of my favorite film scores (soundtrack reissue anyone?)"
2,I love this movie but I am disapointed in the DVD version,"I love this movie. I bought it on VHS a few years back. When I learned that it was released on DVD I bought a copy. I was disapointed that it wasn;t in widescreen, but the bigger disapointment was that the ARAB was no longer subtitled. this took away from the movie."
5,The best action movie ever,I wish i could have went and seen this movie in the movie theater back in '86. The music is awesome. The scenes are great. Very well directed. It makes me cry to watch the two sad scenes in the movie. I loved the way it opened up with a chopper exploding then Norris running to help his friend still in the burning chopper. Just as the plane is leaving to get out of the desert the captain tells the colonel that Norris and Peter are still back there. The colonel tells him that they can't wait and they have to get out ASAP. Just as they are leaving out comes Norris carrying his injured friend. It is THE BEST action scene ever made. I swear there is no better action scene. and the soundtrack is inspiring and very good.
5,Phenomenal acting,"People say Chuck Norris can't act. I say it's because he was never put in a role where he could flat out act and show his talents. In this movie we see some awesome and inspiring acting. Bo Svenson who is the black captain is flat out awesome in this movie. I loved the part where Captain McCoy played by Norris comes in late in his van while the Delta Force is about to depart from the U.S. I won't even tell you the rest because this movie is awesome. I have it on an old tape censored from USA Network, but I recently bought the VHS so I could add it to my collection. The music is great too. Anyone know where I can get the soundtrack?"
4,The Motorcycles and Dune Buggies Rule!!,"Man, I've seen about every action movie there is, but this is the best ever. The motorcycles shoot missles for crying out loud! That's AWESOME. I've never seen the uncensored version in my life. I must buy it and see the difference."
5,"A look at ""The Delta Force""","""The Delta Force"" is a 1986 movie with tons of action and an excellent soundtrack. Scott McCoy (Chuck Norris) plays a Delta Force operative freeing hostages from a hijacked plane. The terrorists are in for a surprise when he blows them up with a missile-launching motorcycle! Possibly more explosions than Rambo III."
2,ICEBERG NORRIS,Whatever merits this picture has (one of them being the presence of Lee MArvin) it is destroyed by Norris'usual lack of acting...
1,Can I give it less than one star?,"Do you love Chuck Norris kicking-butt action movies? Then steer clear of this snooze fest. In the first 30 seconds, a chopper mysterious bursts into flames. That's it for action until an hour later when a truck bursts into flames moments after Chuck Norris runs out from behind it. Thrilling? no. Chuck Norris is barely even this movie! Why is he on the cover? Chuck Norris and the other commandos are in the first 10 minutes, then don't get any screen time until over an hour later. I couldn't tell you what happens after that because I gave up and went to bed.If you like slow drawn out terrorists-hijacking-a-plane flicks, then you might be able to watch this through to the end. I'd rather get some sleep.Overall, BORING."
3,Hilarious,"This is one of the funniest movies ever made. What was the director thinking? Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin combo is pure badassery, and this movie has more corny lines than you can imagine. If you cant appreciate a terribly made, terribly scripted, terribly acted, and terribly filmed movie, this isnt for you. Every time I watch this, I bust up laughing, and no, its not supposed to be funny."
4,Delta Force,"Loved this movie since I was a kid. Super cheesy, but I still love it, especially the motorcycles with the rockets."
4,Delta Force DVD rocks EXCEPT FOR ONE THING,"The Delta Force starring Chuck Norris is a great movie but the DVD lacks one crucial thing and that is thing is subtitles thorughout the film, whether they are translations for the bad guys or to let the audience know where they are, date and time.The VHS version has them so why does the DVD lack something so important as to just what the hell the baddies are talking about, I honestly hope that MGM decides to fix this problem by re-releasing The Delta Force again on DVD with the missing subtitles and maybe even in widescreen."
5,The Delta Force is real action!,"Lee Marvin and Chuck Norris lead the highly trained Delta Force in the fight against terrorism. Perhaps Chuck's best movie even though it doesn't feature the best fight scenes. The Delta Force is straight forward action. Nothing fancy here. When the terrorists high-jack the plane, Lee and Chuck go into action and rescuing the hostages won't be too easy. Experience and technology help not only out fight the terrorists, but also out think them. The Delta Force is fun to watch and won't disappoint. This is what Chuck Norris films should be like, pure, gritty, and full of action."
5,EXCELLENT,This movie is great. One has to watch it just once to appreciate it. The movie is not only fun action with a great soundtrack but it is also has a deep and intricate historical plot. The hijacking in the movie is based on the hijacking of a real flight in the 80's that was flying from Athens to Rome and then on to New York. The characters are developed well especially the stewrdess who IS GREAT. The stewrdess is a real character and she is German which is key to her role. The whole scene when she is calling names from the passport is also based on the actual events. Don't let the fact that it is a Chuck Norris flick let you down this is really a great movie that you can enjoy.
5,Love this move,"I was very happy with this movie and the qty of product, and it didn't cost that much even for a blue ray"
4,Subtitles,"The only thing I do not like about this movie being on DVD, is that the english subtitles (I.E. the translation of the language used by the hijackers and other foreigners) and the timelines for the movie were left out, whereas they were on the VHS version. If you make another version of this film (I.E. Special Edition, Director's Cut, etc.) please include those items. Other than that, the movie was excellent. I wish all forms of airline hijacking was handled this way."
5,Very Good,Most likely my favorite Chuck Norris movie of all time. They rarely show it on TV so I knew I would have to buy this DVD online. It's a great investment.
4,Great CD,"I purchased this CD a few months back and it has become a permanent fixture in my car. I LOVE this CD. Dumb, Dumb Dorothy, Pity Party, Boys Want...Are just hilarious and fun to sing along to. Absolutely Bonkers, Rite the First Time (my favorite) and Fae Cross are fantastic. All around great collection of tunes. If you're more into mainstream music, then this is certainly not for you, but if you like the more ""colorful"" artists, then this is a must have. I have ordered Hair of Frog and am looking forward to getting it. Go ahead. Click the order button! You know you want to! :)"
3,Pagan meets Dr Demento,"The Three Weird Sisters have their own brand of music, certainly. If you liked the Dr Demento show on the radio, you will like their albums. Some of the songs are nice, but others are just not my taste. I don't think I would get their next one, but others may enjoy it."
3,not for all applications,"so i bought this because the sleeve on my ipod connectors was coming apart at the ends and i didnt want to use black electrical tape on it.first, this stuff smells really toxic, so make sure to be outside when you use.second, application is a little messy because it takes some time for the liquid to settle, so if you want even coverage you have to maneuver your cable around to keep the liquid from collecting on just one side.third, after it's dry, it looks fine but im giving it 3 stars because it dries hard. meaning that if you bend it it will break. so if it's something in your car or behind your wall go for it, but if you need to use it on something that moves don't buy this."
2,Pretty but not very stable,"It is a very colorful mobile. My baby loves to look at it but the arm swivels easily and had bumped the baby on the head. The pieces also fall off easily. If you remove the colorful animals from the snakes, it is safer."
3,Good toy but not entirely what its cracked up to be,"I love Sassy products but this mobile was a slight letdown. It did accomplish that task that I wanted - keeping my baby happy while still in her infant tub. At the same time I was worried about her tugging on it. It did not stay up as well as they would like you to think. My daughter loves it now that she is in the ""big tub"" and has the various components to play with. Worth the purchase but it isn't everything I thought it would be."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!,This product is horrible. I have never written a review of a product but I feel very strongly [about this]! I bought because it was so cute and I thought my daughter would love it and she did until it fell on her head. It doesn't attach well to the tub or the infant tub. Don't waste your money. ...
3,Very cute- but doesn't stay together,"This mobile is very cute, and I love the way it grows with the baby. But the pieces fall off constantly and I'm afraid they'll hit my baby in the head. They don't really attach other than by a little bit of tension, and the slightest jiggle of the bathtub sends them flying. Maybe it will be better as a toddler toy."
1,Dangerous,"I bought this toy because I thought it would give my 4 month old daughter something to look at while she is in the bathtub. It comes with a large suction cup that you use to attach the mobile to the side of the tub. I put the mobile up and pulled on it to make sure it was going to stay. We put my daughter in the tub and two minutes later it came crashing down on her. I do not recommend this product, there is no way of making sure it is going to stay."
5,Excellent book!,"This is an excellent book on the subject. Author doesn't leap to far fetched concusions but neither is he accepting the standard explanations(bad weather, pilot error, etc). Very insightful. Its been a while since I enjoyed the book as much as this one. Highly recommended."
3,It fits my cat but she got out of it anyway.,"This is the same type muzzle my Vet uses. I bought it to keep my cat calm and to prevent her from biting when we give her a bath. The muzzle fits her well, but she was able to rub her face against my leg and get the muzzle off. I gave it just three stars because it did not work for my cat. This does not mean it will not work well for others."
5,Like This? Then Check This!,"Anyone interested in this fine set will almost certainly like this set from the same label:Mississippi Blues: Rare Cuts 1926-41 [Box set, Original recording remastered]Even though you are a blues lover and collector - this set might hold many new sides and artists for you."
5,The Sun Rises,"Finally a bible {Quran} of Secrets revealed. No matter what level of ""awareness"" you're experiencing, the ""here-now"" or the ""here-after"" of the present moment within your in-time, this book will literally blow your heart open, and therein take you on a journey of self-discovery.Its not a atypical Sufi outlook, but rather a detailed enhancement of the ""reality"" one perceives in the levels of comprehension. With the Guide showing you doors of ""enlightement"" via the visible prophet Khidr, one is led to unmask the many veils within veils {Secret of Secrets} of the human psyche and makeover.A must-read book for anyone seeking to comprehend, or catch a glimpse of the ""Absolute Reality""., without compromising on dogmas {veils} conditioned over the years of ""existence"" so to speak. An excellent study for theologists!"
3,be careful,"in terms of spirituality, this is a very well-rounded book which sort of innoculates one against the stupid or naive notions or ideas/ideals of spirituality caused by some new-age books or writings, especially in terms of the good/evil , day/night sort of thing where people nowadays spirituality is all roses and bunnies and a perfect master cannot get angry or whatever.but, it is also too big, with some unnecessary and cumbersome parts, and it also contains some very heretical ideas (ex1: defence of yezidi devil worshippers and telling one to be more dark than white in spirituality to balance the world out, ex2: some very heretical notions sometimes espoused by extreme shiites than even shiites find heretical) and some outright lies and misleading at some points.all in all one should be careful when reading this book but its probably worth a read. i particulary liked the writings on the ahlul bayt."
1,This book is pathetic fallacy!,"In all honesty, books like this serve no purpose at all. Human nature and human evolution prove that the male sex organ is at average size 5.25 inches long. What is wrong with being average? Apparently, according to the author, there is something wrong. I read this book out of curiosity and I found it disgusting that someone would put down men for being normal.As for the enlargement techniques, it is nothing more then a fallacy if any man believes he will increase his sex organ size. Save your money and buy your girl some flowers that will do more for her heart then reading a book that is made to make you feel bad for being normal."
1,Global 21 pocket unpractical bag for the chef,"Not very practical, not enough outside pockets, the inside zipper should be 2 different zippers so you don't always have to open the entire bag. There is not enough storage for extras gadgets. The 21 pockets for knives is great but that is the only thing that is great. This bag is not good for anyone who has to go in and out of the bag throughout the day. I would not reccomend this bag at all!!"
5,Yolanda's best,"I believe this is Yolanda's most well rounded album. It shows off her amazing vocal skills and her versatility and range. From the upbeat ""This Joy"" to the highly inspiring ""The Battle is the Lord's"" and ""Save the World"". She shows she can handle a latin beat with ""Ye of Little Faith"" and shows a heart of worship on the gorgeous ""Let Us Worship"", which is probably my favorite on the album. ""I Will Always Remember"" is also very moving. The mark of a great album is can you listen to the whole thing repeatedly and this album is definitely that. The best thing to do- by this album and set aside time to listen to it and you will understand why I consider this as Ms. Adam's absolute best."
5,"gorgeous, tasteful, inspiring, wonderful!!!!","Yolanda Adams has such a powerful, sweet voice. It's a joy to listen to, and her range and musicality are awesome. The tunes on this CD are all very strong. I especially loved A Real Love and The Battle is Not Yours (2nd tune). I've been looking for just this wonderful marriage of quality, soulful R&B and gospel music for a long time! Hope she puts out another one soon."
2,THIS MOVIE STRUCK A BERG. PUN INTENDED.,"From a casting viewpoint, this TV movie has a lot to offer. Great cast. From a plot viewpoint, this movie went down with the ship. I absolutely agree with other reviewers that the rape scene was totally unnecessary. I guess with so many versions of the Titanic story already told, the film makers needed something to make this version stand out. Unfortunately, the brutal rape of a young immigrant girl was a very bad choice as a plot variant. This production makes one realize that there already exist quite a sufficient number of movies on this subject. I mean, in the end, the ship sinks and people die. Tragic, yes, but I think we all get it by now. Enough already."
2,Don't get your hopes up,"If you've already seen James Cameron's Titanic, skip this one or you're in for a big disappointment. First of all the acting is atrocious!! They added a few well known names but even they can't carry this movie. Second of all, the creators of this film paid little attention to detail and accuracy. Most of the historical characters, such as Molly Brown are nothing more than characatures of themselves and badly done at that. The script could have been written by a Junior High school student. The effects are slightly higher than your average TV series but that's not saying much. The film realy stunk in my book. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,"Not the best, but better","When I watched the Cameron movie I was in tears for about 10 minutes of the movie -- this version, virtually the entire last half. Yes, some of it was corny, but not as bad as the Picasso scene from the latest movie. And the sub-plot beat the hell out of Cameron's. It's too bad the special effects of the 1997 movie and this script couldn't be merged. It would definitely make for one better movie."
2,Not impressed,"I am a huge historical Titanic buff, and this movie was truly dissapointing to me. The plot was thin at best, the cast, though superb, turned in a rather blase performance. This protrayal didn't capture the spirit of the distaster as some of the best documentaires and movies have done. As a fan of this historical event, I was truly dissapointed in this very ""Hollywoodized"" attempt."
2,Not What It Could Have Been,"If you have already seen Cameron's TITANIC (who hasn't?), then DON'T BOTHER. This movie has pretty good special effects (for TV), but it lacks the power of good Titanic films. It runs like a long (often BORING) soap opera with stick-figure characters that resemble Cameron's characters way too much (somebody steal an early script??). Forget this one, that terrible rape scene and NO Thomas Andrews (the ship builder) and go watch Cameron's epic or the 1955 Night To Remember (the 2nd best Titanic movie out there)."
1,Disgusted,Rape scene with Tim Curry. Typical moral-less standard. Horrible. DO NOT BUY! If I could I'd rate it zero. Wasting my 20 words on smut for benefit of possible viewers.
1,Disposed of the disc,"I have never felt so strongly about getting rid of a movie as I did this one--and I disposed of the disc in tonight's trash! What an outrageous and disgusting movie. The boat was a veritable Peyton Place...thievery, fornication, a horrid rape scene and discussion about a maid who appeared thoroughly unbalanced in the early part of the movie who was rumored to have murdered her baby. I saw and heard enough of this garbage being passed off as entertainment and stopped there. Protect your own mind and heart and that of your family by passing this one by. It's worse than AWFUL. I understand it received an Emmy award...despicable."
5,On Par with Cameron's epic...,"Impressive re-telling of the Titanic disaster, with excellent performances by George C. Scott as the noble captain of the doomed vessel, and especially by the incredible Tim Curry as a truly odious villain - not his usual broad, ""campy"" bad guy, but a true, soul-chilling performance. As always, he steals the show. Gorgeous-looking, and terrific special effects, especially considering it's a TV movie...makes one wonder if Cameron drew some inspiration from this one. Highly recommended."
2,Not up to the other version,"Despite the beauty of Catherine Zeta-Jones, and some good costumes, this did not hit the mark with me. If the other (James Cameron)version did not exist, this might be looked upon a bit more favorably, I don't know. George C. Scott did a good job as Captain Smith, but other than that, I really can't find much good to say about this movie. Get the other one, with Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet."
3,Sappy but OK,"The story we know. Ship goes down and many die. Tragic. The cast is good (though Peter Gallagher bugs me). I like Marilu Henner as an actress but physically she was totally wrong for her part as Molly Brown. The rape scene I agree was totally unnecessary. But if you are a collector of Titanic themed movies, its a nice one to have."
4,Better than the movie version,I liked this movie a whole lot. I didn't care for the Titanic Leonardo and Kate did. To me it was terrible. Didn't see what all the hype all about. But this one was really good.
1,Horrible!,The movie was abolutly horrible. Special effects and plot were horrible. Did the guys who made the movie read a book about the Titanic? Guess not.
3,good but need's more,i thought the book was great but i think there needs to be more and simmiler stuff from now like in the future
5,The Irish Devil,"I have yet to read a bad book by Diane Whiteside. I first found her in ebook format and fell in love with her work, and this book just tell me that she is only getting better. I look forward to her next one."
5,Always a sure bet,DW is always a must buy in my book.....I have all of her Elloras Cave stuff and I love being able to buy her in paperback. TID does not disappoint with a great heroine and lots of page turning action of one sort or another...Only problem with having all her stuff is waiting for what's next..
2,Very disappointed,"I, too, purchased this because of the glowing reviews I read online, but it did not come close to living up to the hype. There is no romance in this book. The heroine is a plaything for all kinds of kink for the hero, but it is written as merely an exchange of fluids, not emotion. I found I didn't care whether the couple lived happily ever after because Whiteside didn't give me any reason to. Very little depth to the characters, but the villain was a bit more fleshed out than the leads and that is why I gave it two stars instead of one. If you want to read it for the sex, try to find it at the library or used book store. You may adore it, but if you don't you wouldn't have wasted as much money as I did."
1,"Not an ""Irish Devil"" to Me!","Well, I was looking for something different to read. Saw the reviews for this book. Well, I am sorry to say the book just didn't do it for me. The book was boring and long winded. I will not try this author again."
2,Not great,"Well, I haven't yet finished the book but I have to agree with the ppl that say that this book is not good. It's true that it's the first time that I read a romance that goes on the erotica genre. I have read some classic erotica very explicit also but well written and I can't say the same thing about ""The Irish Devil"". The plot begins in a very interesting way and the characters seem also interesting but after one or two chapters all is only an excuse for sex and not sex as a consequence of the storyline.I will try to finish it because I hate to leave a book unread in the middle but I don't think I am going to buy another book by this author."
3,Kinda boring,"Having read Whiteside's anthology with Angela Knight,Captive Dreams, i thought this book would be hot and exciting. While the sex scenes were hot enough, the rest of the story really kinda bored me. It was an ok read but not what i was expecting."
4,The Irish Devil,The writing made you feel like all the characters were people you would like to know. I thought it was great read.
4,RAISES LOT OF QUESTIONS!!!,"Matt Braun writes a good western. Luke Starbuck is hired to find out who is behind the Wells Fargo robbies in Arizona. He is lead to believe it is Wyatt Earp and his brothers along with Doc Holladay. He becomes aware this is true and sets out to find some waya to stop him. His plan is to get Wyatt and his brothers fighting against the ones who actually do the robberies. He is determined to stop or kill Wyatt Earp. The book is fast moving. I question anyone being able to do what Starbuck does in the book. If this is a half way true story,it changes my mind on the character of Wyatt Earp and his brothers. I had always thought them to be law enforcement people who were on the up and up, but maybe not. A statment in the front of the book says while the actions may have been changed a little, all else is closer to the truth and the myth. Who am I to say. You will have to read and decide for yourself."
2,surf fishing,"book is way behind the times, all equipment that they listed was old and outdated, will look at sample before I purchase another"
2,Dubbed Version can't beat Original,"I am a obessed viewer of Dragonballz. What brought me to this anime is the original japanese version. The english dubbed version cuts parts of episodes, censors things, lacks emotion, and has bad voice actors. Although the dubbed ones aren't ALL bad, I would recommend you wait for the subtitled version to come out instead of buying the dubbed."
2,Guess you have to like Gangrel.,"The third in the clan novel series, this book does not even come close to being as good as the first two books in the series, Toreador and Tzimisce. It does center much more so around one vampire than the first two books, the Gangrel Ramona. She is trying to figure out who she is and what she has become.The main plot of the series, with the Eye of Hazimel, continues to develop. Leopold, the Torry, has gone completely insane. Other elements of the New York vampires are showing up, namely the Tremere.I didn't like this novel nearly as much as the first two. Maybe Ramona will develop as the novels progress, but for now, I could care less to read anymore about her. WHERE IS SASHA? Now she was interesting!"
5,GHERBOD GOES GREAT GUNS ON GANGREL,"Ramona the Gangrel and main character shows the characterization of a member of the clan who has for two years had no sire to show her the way a Gangrel act as she fights to save the humanity she has left Her sire Tanner comes back to retrieve her without being much help.She must contend and learn that in this new life which is refreshing not to have her become adjusted to the ways of the Kindred or the Ways of the Gangrel easy,She continues to struggle with the fact of her immortality and that the world outside is now only meant for sustenance,If you loved Kindred:The Embraced You'll love this book and if your a fan of other vampire novelists like Rice,and Wiecker you Will enjoy this book.The actions of Ramona will surprise you as they surpise her.I hope the others are as Good if not better than these.can't wait for Setite"
2,This was a book,"Well I quess you have to read it. I mean you don't want to get lost in the series. But I could not tell you a single thing that happened in this book(such as plot), well, because I don't think anything did happen. This whole series has been vague and evasive. We can hope though."
5,Sensitivity!,"As a long term professional photographer, I have never used this type of camera strap!After purchasing this wrist strap, I couldn't believe the difference... Yes it is saferto carry your camera, but the most important difference is the feel, and the sensitivityin the trigger-finger. You now have the weight of the camera distributed differently, andyour fingers are free for the actual important and sensitive task to push buttons, turnthe wheel etc. A great experience!"
1,Awful design.,"I was looking for a simple hand strap for my Canon 7D. Nothing fancy. However, this strap is poorly designed and very hard to adjust. Once you get it adjusted just right, the camera still tends to move around a lot. Will be returning this."
1,Back she goes with bells on,"I could see no way to secure the strap loop to the camera body. I know how to put a strap on a camera. This just kept pulling loose, and attempting the over-under of other working straps was impossible due to insufficient openings in the buckle. What a waste. Will go to a reputable camera shop, buy a proper strap, and let them put it on for me."
1,This wrist strap is junk!,"In a world of copies and imitations, this is just another piece of junk from the 3rd world. It fits poorly.You'd be better served by going to PetsMart for a nylon dog collar to thread through your camera's frame mount. Alternatively, spend the $ and buy an original from your camera's manufacturer.I sent mine back."
4,Whose Life is it Anyway,"This is a movie dealing with the aspect of living out a life witha totally disabling condition, which involves complete dependenceon medical care, and continued stress due to the side effectsof living such a life. Many quadroplegics lose the option of saying'no' to doctors, in regard to meds administered, or having to continuing living. I applaude the judge's decision in the end. At last!Life is supposed to be about CHOICE. Good acting, they got theidea across beautifully."
3,Whose Life,Good movie version of the screenplay. Great price for the DVD. This movie has all but been forgotten and it was nice to see that it is still available. A great compliment to the original play.
5,Replaced finally,"I had this on VHS but had been unable to find on DVD.On the teaching side. I have used this film to facilitate discussions on fragility of life, patient vulnerability, patient/clinician relationships, patient respect, and right to die issues.On the entertainment side. It is a generally very well made, thoughtful portrayal of the human condition, defining of quality of life, and human choice. Are your advance directives in place?"
5,Whose life is it anyways?,A great movie that provokes thoughtful discussions about the ethics of prolonging life at any cost versus the right to die
1,Awful!!!,Excellent movie!!! Terrible Quality in it's reproduction. DVD is like a cheap home made VHS tape. Don't buy it!!! You will be disappointed.
4,One of Norris' Best,"An Eye For An Eye is easily one of Chuck Norris' best films, and not surprisingly, it's not because this is an Oscar-caliber film, or because it breaks some new ground.Rather, An Eye For An Eye is great because it does what it's supposed to do very, very well. In fact, this is the first film of Norris' that really holds up well. In it, he plays a San Francisco cop who's partner gets killed during an arrest. A conspiracy develops that engulfs Norris, his dead partner's fiance who happens to be a TV news reporter, and Norris' martial arts instructor, played by Mako.The fight scenes in this film are some of Norris' best, and having the fearsome wrestler/actor Professor Toru Tanaka as the main henchman in the film doesn't hurt either. Mako provides great comic relief, and Richard Roundtree is solid as Norris' superior officer.An Eye For An Eye is a great martial arts/action film. One that Chuck Norris can be very proud to have on his list of credits."
2,"Good 80's Action Movie, Weak Menu","This movie is for Chuck Norris Fans Only (Like Me). The movie is good and has some nice fights but seems a bit old for today standards.The DVD quality is good but you're not getting any special features en the Menu, just the movie with optional subs and the trailer.But if you like Chuck Norris and B-Action films, you must see this movie or add it to your collection."
2,Why not widescreen ?,"Check out this cast: Chuck Norris, Chris Lee, Dick Roundtree, Mako, Terry Kiser and Matt Clark. You just gotta love it. It's among Chuck's best movies, but I must say I'm disappointed MGM have chosen not to letterbox this Norris classic, when both ""Invasion U.S.A."" and ""Lone Wolf Mcquade"" are in widescreen. It's a good little actioner with good fights and Mr. Norris' cop after Mr. Lee's crimelord, and I would've loved to add it to the collection, but not now. (It's even out in widescreen on a Dutch R2 release !.) I wonder why MGM went with a full-screen version, but I think I know. -They're testing the market if it'll sell any good. Well, are they really that stupid ?. Haven't they learned from their full-screen mistakes with Chuck's two R1 ""Delta Force"" DVDs ?. (Also out in widescreen on R2.) When the word gets around, no one will buy it, and the other two new Norris titles will win. -Just when you thought it was safe to buy MGM again along comes this loser."
4,"It's Revenge Plot 101, but if isn't broke don't fix it.","When policeman Chuck Norris's partner is killed in a drug bust gone bad, the former karate champ goes on the rampage, kicking in the teeth of all that get in his way. Hey, wasn't this the plot of Forced Vengeance? Well, yes it is. But where that movie was passable chop sokey hokum, An Eye for An Eye gets a little boost from a better cast (you could not beat having Christopher Lee and Richard Roundtree in the same movie) and the picturesque backdrop of the San Francisco setting. It just seemed to work a little bit better this time around. Recommended for those who like movies with a little kick to them."
3,one of the better Chuck Norris films,"This is one of the best Chuck Norris movies, so if you like Chuck Norris movies, that's saying something. The DVD is not the greatest quality, and there are no special extras. It's just the movie for the most part. Chuck's got a better supporting cast in this one than he often does, and even though the plot is not too different than a lot of movies of this genre, this one is just more entertaining overall. Chuck's got a mentor in this one who helps him out in the required final showdown sequence with the bad guys. And one of the bad guys is none other than the actor who played ""Scaramanga"" from The Man With the Golden Gun, though he had to leave his extra nipple with the James Bond studio..."
1,Not What I Expected,"According to the item's description, I expected to receive the ""professional strength"" version of this product. What I did get was the standard formulation. I thought the price was exceptionally low, and now I know why."
2,grossly inaccurate,"This story was a wonderful fantasy (5 stars for that) but a grossly inaccurate representation of life at the US Air Force Academy, and life as a USAF pilot. (one star for horrific research) The characters totally skipped pilot training. That's like a surgeon skipping residency! And they hopped from one type of airplane to another, including the common assumption that fixed wing pilots can fly helicopters, too. That would be like a doctor practicing OB-GYN one month, and switching to podiatry the next. The author could easily, I think, put an author's note explaining that fact complicated her plot, and that would have been satisfactory for me, and understandable. But to pass off what she wrote about as an accurate representation of USAF life and combat is unforgiveable."
3,Cute book but not as good as the original,"While I think Disney's animated version is a delightful adaptation of the Dodie Smith book of the same title, the Disney picture books based on the movie leave out all of the wit and charm of the original. Treat yourself and get the the Dodie Smith version."
5,Huey's view of the west,"Reading Round-UpFor this month's book, I'm recommending Six Bits a Day, by Elmer Kelton. This is the prequel to the story I told you about last month, The Good Old Boys. The same two main characters Huey and Walter Calloway are portrayed in this story as hardworking, cattle driving cowboys set on the ranches and ranges of west Texas. As always, Huey is easy going, fun loving, and doesn't care about saving a dime. His brother Walter, however, has matrimonial aims to settle down with a good woman and claim his own piece of land. Huey does his best to distract Walter from his goals by signing the two of them on to drive six hundred head of cattle back to C.C. Tarpley's Pecos River ranch. Huey's aim is to pull Walter away from the distraction of the branding fire stoked by the sweet girl who lives in the boarding house. Range wars, murderers and conniving saboteurs are out to snatch the cattle away before Huey and Walter can deliver them to C.C.'s spread.--Robin Moore"
1,I Have Found That There are Better Options,"From the previous reviews it seems that this product doesn't deliver any satisfaction at all. Buy instead the wrist roller manufactured by proboxinggear.I bought one eight months ago and I loved it. I use it at home and even at the gym, since it is small and very light, so it fits in my backpack taken about the same space than my gloves.The one I bought is really an excellent accessory, since is not only a Wrist exerciser, but a complete Forearm Strengthener. Simple to use, with no spring or moving or breakable parts, it looks like it will resist the hardest workouts and continuous use.With simple rolling movements and as you gradually increase resistance by adding weight plates to it you strengthen hands, wrist, forearms and upper arms. I have considerably improved wrist stability and holding power, and also feel an Increased range of motion and flexibility"
5,long awaited solo cd,"Chris' long awaited solo cd is a great effort. For those concerned about his ability to write without Rich, your fears are over. There are great songs on this cd! My faves include Sunday Sound (very Grateful Dead-esque), Ride (a funky fave), Untangle My Mind (Van Morrison sounding) and the opener, Safe in The Arms of Love. My complaints would be that there are a few too many ballad type tunes that really slow it down, and the lack of balls out rockers, but maybe the guy will make another cd with those types of tunes on it. On the otherhand, a song like Could You Really Love Me is a good direction for Chris, showing his command of the R&B funk of Prince/Sly & the Family Stone.Crowes fans will miss the freewheeling rock out that was the last few Crowes cds, but hey, this is a different beast. Its definitely got a solo vibe to it, but Chris works well with his new guitarist/producer, (the very underrated) Paul Stacey."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I really wish I could say I liked this CD. But I liked only three songs out of the twelve presented here. Things were really looking up with ""Safe In The Arms Of Love"" and ""Silver Car""-the two songs which kick off NEW EARTH MUD. Then we hit a morass of confused sound until ""She's On Her Way""-a great song but unfortunately the last on this album.I was a big fan of the Black Crowes. I even liked the albums most critics panned such as THREE SNAKES & ONE CHARM and AMORICA. So I was really ready to root for Robinson's new project. Maybe in the future, things will pick up. But in the meantime I would advise others to take a pass on this one.NEW EARTH MUD comes with a companion DVD contained a documentary and live accostic performances the band. A lot of people eat this kind of thing up and would buy this album just to get the DVD. I was unimpressed and bored. The DVD didn't change my attitude toward NEW EARTH MUD in the least.Sorry, Chris. I'm on your side but I can't recommend this one."
3,Nice Effort - Needs Refining,"Kudos to Chris for not rehashing Crowe-like material with a different band. I'm fine with the fact that the entire CD focuses on ""Katie Dear."" Heck, without love songs, what would the Beatles and Sinatra have written about? Auto Repair? Albums with a mellow feel have their place (ie my stereo during a summer evening cruise with the Jeep topless), and passion isn't neccesarily sappy (refer to much of Southern Harmony..) However, maybe 4 songs are A-list material. The rest, in my opinion, is listless, rambling filler. I wonder how the album would sound if he rerecorded it after refining much of the material on the road? You might find this surprising, but I can't wait for the show next week."
4,Very Good,I was so pleased with this album. Having not been a big a fan of the last two Crowes LPs I was skepticle of the kind of tunes a solo album from Chris would yield. After a couple of spins my worries were laid to rest. In my opinion this is the best Black Crowes related release since Amorica.I heard these songs performed during an acoustic set at the El Rey in Los Angeles last September -- hoping for a companion live disc.
3,"Nice Sentiment, but...","I realize that Chris Robinson needs to make his own statement. As a fan of the Crowes, I find myself missing the missing elements. I find it hard to write an un-biased review, since I love everything these guys do. The familiar elements in 'New Earth Mud' certainly do shine. 'Safe in the Arms of Love', 'Could You Really Love Me?', 'Sunday Sound', 'Ride' (very funky ala Sly and the Family Stone) are all great but I believe that Rich Robinson's input would have made them spark a little more. This CD is filled with sentimental love songs ('Katie Dear') The musical equivalent of getting a girl's name tattooed on your arm."
2,An average album,"Let's be honest for potential buyers who are not extreme Black Crowes fans. This is a Chris Robinson solo effort. It is average. Black Crowes together is much better, and much more listenable. For the pop/folksy sound Robinson is trying to convey, so many more artists are so much better.Not to say this is not a decent album. It is. It just isn't that good. The accompanying music is great. Crisp and clean and good sounding. Robinson's vocals alone just aren't really what would be expected for a big label production effort.This disc is good for one, perhaps a second mercy listen. Then it will likely go into the bottom of the pile to be not listened to. Sorry. If you are a HUGE Chris Robinson fan....maybe..... If not, well, perhaps best to try something else or listen to a couple of tracks first."
2,The Robinson brothers need each other!,"I am a tremendous fan of the Black Crowes, and I welcome any solo effort from the members. The problem is, however, that the songs on this album are very boring and never really take off. There's just no kick, no jive. Such a shame, because the album's artwork is extraordinary and Chris's vocals and talents as a rock star are prodigious (as are his brother/guitarist Rich). I still love ya' but the fact is, that God meant for the Brother's Robinson to be together. Nothing wrong with a little break once in a while, but this solo schtick will not wash over the long haul."
2,Oh No.,"Our beloved Chris Robinson has gone and made a good sounding album laden with BAD BAD BAD poetry. Katie dear, Oh Katie Dear can you please rewind the tape to where the whole band starts singing Tiny Dancer?Buy Beck's new one instead."
2,Not As Expected; but fair,"This item is kinda disappointing. The DVD is very brief and the 'so called' acoustics on it are AUDIO ONLY I thought we were going to be able to see him play those acoustics! But the documentry is viewable, trouble is, its shot in such a way you really can't see Chris's face that clear so if I was rating the bonus DVD alone it would get MINUS one star. The cd is fair. There are some pretty decent songs. But overall I doubt I'll play it a long time. I like his vocals. The songs are the trouble, I read someone else say they're easy to get into, I disagree they are kinda slow & long. Not popish or catchy at all. I wasn't expecting The Black Crowes but I would like it to be a tad bit faster & catchy. Some songs are ok....some are plain bad.. its an ok cd just not good compared to other fantastic cds released this past year. Sorry Christopher but your package gets two stars dude. I'd given you three stars if the DVD was better."
1,oh no!,"i'm glad chris is happily married, i guess. good thing kate has a job, because he needs to retire. this album is so disappointing."
4,Different,"I love this album. From the gorgeous cover art and packaging to the songs inside it...Chris has done a wonderful job. I was very anxious to hear this material and I am not disappointed. I must admit that I am a HUGE Chris fan and love the Crowes, but this is very different than anything Chris did with the guys. Its very mature, and I dont intend that to take away from anything the Crowes did, but Chris is older, and this music shows. Track highlites for me include ""Silver Car"" ""Sunday Sound"" (composed with Marc Ford!) and ""Ride."" The whole album is great, and if we cant have the Crowes, I'll take more from Chris. Buy this album now!"
4,A young sounding Gilda,"Too many recordings have a soprano that sounds too old to convince me that she is a young girl. Even though they may have the vocal technique to manage the trills or show emotion in their voice, they still sound too mature for me. Scotto sounds like a trusting innocent and makes for a Gilda so pure that her downfall is all the more tragic. The only other Gilda on record that sounds as young is Edita Gruberova. This recording also has Pavarotti singing the Duke, which is a plus. Paskalis is straight forward in his interpretation of the title role and should satisfy most listeners. A good buy for the price."
3,For What It's Worth,"This is a good album, for what it is: basically speaking, a licensed bootleg. Therefore, we encounter the various sound problems inherent in a live acoustic performance. Pavarotti can be heard (most of the time), but I will warn you, the orchestra threatens to drown others in the cast (especially the chorus).That, again, is to be expected in this type of recording.Rigoletto, the Duke, and Gilda all sound very well (what other character matters, eh?).Missed is the Duke's aria ""Possente Amor"", which immediately preceeds the immortal ""Cortigiani"" in performance. Outside of a few measures here and there (traditional cuts), this is the only thing missing.However, this has always been my favorite opera, and when you're dealing with Opera D'Oro, you don't always get perfect quality (bootlegs all), but you ALWAYS get what you paid for at least."
1,Who would have thought...,"The good--Scotto's interpretation creates a believable character and Pavarotti sings in his pre-superstar, not-overblown manner (remember, this is a good thing) The bad--Scotto runs out of breath at the end of 'Caro Nome' and we fear her survival (vocally, that is) in almost every scene. This recording wins the award for 'Worst Performance by a Major Opera House Chorus.' The recorded sound is variable in volume and balance (Giulini's conducting doesn't help matters) and the smaller roles are taken by timid or incompetent singers. The ugly--too bad our Rigoletto here, Kostas Paskalis, wasn't recorded under better circumstances."
2,"not accurate to size, uncomfortable, mushy.","I got snowed in during a business trip a month ago, and had to stay over an extra two days, which meant a trip to the shops for a bit of extra clothing. I picked up one of these bras in a brick and mortar in my standard size... and that was a mistake.If you're looking for uniboob, this is your garment. If you like being squished and still feeling insecure, here you go.The only good thing I can say about this is that it appears that it will last until approximately three days after the sun expands and engulfs the earth..."
5,A CLASSIC OF MY CHILDHOOD,"My grandmother gave me this book for Christmas in 1952. My favorite story was the The Story of the Live Dolls. I made my mother read it to me over and over. When my granddaughter was three, I searched the internet for this book...so I could read that story to her."
3,Better Homes and Gardens Storybook,This was not the book I thought I ordered. I wanted the first Better Homes and Gardens Storybook. This one does not have either familiar or particularly interesting stories. I do not know how I would have known that this would be the book I would receive and not the one I believed I had ordered.
5,My Favorite During Childhood,"Now I have shared it with my grand daughter, and she adores it too -- as does my daughter, who didn't have it when she was growing up."
4,Should be for ages 3 only not 3 and up,"This game is good becaue it is Dora, however it is way too easy for my 4 year old. The puzzle pieces have the answer right onthe top corner of the card which gives the answer to the child and makes it non challenging. It is very similar to Candyland."
1,Terrible game for anyone over the age of 3,"I bought this game when it first came out for my 4 year old daughter because she LOVES Dora. Unfortunately, it was so new that noone in the toy store I bought it in knew anything about this game. The age on the box is 3+, and is probably perfect only for kids who are just learning to play board games. But there is nothing for the older set - it's not challenging and the game is very quick - over in about 3 minutes. Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders have held my daughter's attention for much longer. On the plus side, the game board is nice looking and very colorful, and there's a miniature backpack that comes with the game that kids will like. Unless your child loves Dora, save your money and buy Candy Land. ..."
1,Don't be fooled,"into buying this for your Dora afficianado. It's Candy Land lite--much, much shorter and less interesting. I have 4 year old twins who love Dora, but they lost interest in this game after playing it just a couple of times. And both had trouble with the spinner."
3,Very basic board game,"I purchased this game for my 4 year old. She loves Dora and learning Spanish. Unfortunately, this game is much too simple and a little boring for her. Also, there is not one iota of Spanish in the game. The answers to the puzzles are pictured right on the game board. This game might be fine for a much younger child, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone over 3."
4,Just alot of Fun - Even for 4 year olds,"My son who just turned 4 got this for his birthday gift. Was it challenging? Not really but he had fun with it -- He and his 5-year old friend played it on their own (with no adult help) several times in a row. My son, even taught his Dad how to play the game. My son would set up all the cards, put the appropriate cards in backpack etc. Simple? YES! But really fun to play and for a Dora fan more fun than Candyland.My son is an avid gamer and won't be satified with really simple games that just have matching. This one meets all his criteria -- you get to spin, move your character and then there are actions/activities depending on where you land!"
2,Junk,"After reading the positive reviews of this product I decided to buy. This product is a piece of junk. The remote barely works from our bed, 10', through an uninsulated interior wall. We have to hold the remote at all weird angles to get the remote to change channels. Not sure if we just got a bum unit or if this product is just no good. I will be throwing this product away and looking for another RF extender."
4,"Easy setup, effective solution. No regrets.","Battery life is kinda ""iffy"" but the instructions did say charge for 36 hrs before first use.....I didn't and I had to swap out in a week. This wasn't a big deal since it comes with 2 batteries, one which is always being charged in the flying saucer. I've had this for about 2 months now and I can definitely say GET THIS PRODUCT! IT WORKS! At $34 with free super saver shipping there isn't a better deal out there. Went back and bought another for my parents' place too.Great invention. Satisfied customer."
1,Slow and unresponsive,"The device is easy to hookup but when you push a button on the remote you have to wait to see if it responds. For me it only responded about 50% of the time, the rest of the time I would have to press the button again and wait again. I had high hopes for this device."
1,Completely useless,Bought this and couldn't get it to work at all. Assumed it was me and waited until I could cash in a favor from my favorite IT guru. He confirmed its uselessness. Too late to return it. Stay away.
1,Does not work with the at&t uverse remote,"This device works very well with certain remotes. However there are others with which it will not work at all. As Murphy's law dictates, in my case the remotes that don't work work are those I really need. At first I thought the unit was faulty or I had incorrectly installed it, as it wouldn't receive a signal from either my At&t; U-verse remote or my Sharp LCD tv remote. However, trying several older remotes, it worked very well with my Pioneer receiver remote and my Sony VCR remote.I am very irritated that the device is sold without a warning that is is completely useless with several common modern remotes. Check on the web to see if it works with your specific remote before buying one of these."
4,Great Solution,"Tried many IR remotes and extenders to control a Comcast cable box from another room to watch the tv which was connected to the box, in that room. None worked well. This RF/IR device worked fine. Was easy to install, with no problems."
5,Next Generation Remote Control Extender,Worked as advertised! I moved the cable box and extender into a closet and out of site. Best part is you no longer have to point the remote at the cable box!!
3,Didn't work for me,"I intended to use it with my 311 Dish Sat box, but it wouldn't work. The led would respond on the saucer but the box didn't respond. So I returned it."
5,next gen remote extender,"I do not write reviews but this product deserved a review. My equipment was recently moved from right under my plasma to a closet on the other side of the house so I could get a ""cleaner"" look under my tv and so now nothing is adorning my wall except the tv. Anyway, I just received my ""ufo"", plugged it in, charged the 2 included batteries in the base unit, (nice touch btw), installed the battery in the included aa adapter, installed in the remote, stood on the other side of the house, and wait for it, my gear fired right up! Just as advertised, plug and play....what a refreshing change that something actually works the first time! I highly recommend this product, everything you need to hide your gear is included and a 2 year old can set it up, 2 minutes max."
2,poor batteries,"I was excited to have found an inexpensive alternative to expensive RF remotes. After setup it worked great for a couple of months. However the problem of batteries not holding a charge longer than 2 or 3 days started. After getting new batteries and new transmitter the problem continued. I am very frustrated because when it works it works fine, but unfortunately that is only about 20% of the time."
2,ho hum,"this blows, it didnt work for me in egypt. i tried hard for it to work but it simply sucked it was fine for a bit it served its purpose but i wouldnt buy it again to be honest"
5,Works Perfect with New Verizon FIOS DVR,"This is the 3rd remote extender I have purchased. Originally had the radio shack one, which was absolutely terrible. I also have a hard wired extender which cost over $100 and works fine, but required running cables etc. The Next Generation Remote Extender took less than 5 minutes to set up and works amazingly. We have the newer Verizon FIOS DVR in a closet about 50 feet from the tv. The remote works every time. I've had it for about a week and a half and no signs of the battery losing any life, not that it matters since it comes with 2 rechargable batteries. While one is in use, the other is being charged. You definitely get the most for your money here. Its every bit as good as the $100+ hard wired extender I have."
1,bad service,"work for about 5 months, now that I have a problem of the remote extender not registering my commands, I have tried to fix it myself but to no success. tried to call the manufacturer for warranty, but their phone goes straight to answering machine. left a message but no reply. tried to contact them through email, but they only have sales email but no reply from that too. so I'm sure I am not the only one who have trouble getting them to pick up their phone call or even reply back please tell me so I know that I am not the only one who is getting screwed."
5,"One of the best ""gadgets"" I ever bought!","I have been using the remote extender for about 5-6 months and can honestly say it's amazing. Unlike other extender this one has no annoying or obtrusive ""transmitters"" visible. The battery life is great, I have only changed it out once in the 5-6 months. Most importantly it works every time.The only draw back to this is it does not work with the new universal remotes simply because they have rechargeable batteries built in. Not a big deal if you are happy with the remote you have.If you are looking for a discrete, simple efficient way to transmit through walls, there is no reason to buy anything but this extender. You will not be disappointed."
5,It Works!,"I received this from Amazon and had it plugged in and working in about five minutes. I have it in a dedicated theater room with a ceiling mounted projector and a separate equipment room for the amps. I placed the extender (UFO) behind the screen wall which is covered with black speaker cloth. It sits on top of my center channel speaker and faces forward toward the seating and the projector which is mounted to the ceiling. I have a Xantech Hot Link Pro emitter system with a 25-ft extended receiver. The Xantech receiver eye is also placed behind the screen wall and in front of the UFO. The Xantech emitters are in the separate equipment room. My home office is about 50ft away and separated by two sets of doors. I sat at my desk and pressed a power on switch. When I got back into the theater room, the power was on. It's simple and it works."
1,Doesn't work with my Cisco cable box from time warner,"So, I can't get it to work with my cable box. 2 phone calls already. I'm waiting for a call back on my 3rd call. I really need this resolved since my box sits inside a cabinet and there's no line of sight for the I R signal."
1,"One acceptable, one just didn't work",The unit placed inside a closet works ok with a delay. The unit I purchased for an adjacent room (through a wall) didn't work at all. A component was lost in the process so I couldn't return. Return policy sucks anyway. There are better options available such as the tiny device that sticks to the bottom or top of the tv with a direct IR eye. THAT works great with no delay and was about the same price. Would not purchase this item again and wish I'd known about that other device when I was hunting for options.
5,works perfectly,"A genius idea. Very simple to install and use... took less than 5 minutes from when the box arrived. The only possible slip-up is finding a good location for the IR transmitter so it will hit the IR receiver of the device you wish to control. In case you don't know what I am talking about.. what this product does is replaces a battery in a remote control. The battery then transmits low powered RADIO signals (RF) to its flying-saucer like base station. An IR cable run from this base station to the device you want to control. The end of that cable is like the little IR bulb on the front of your remote control. You place it near the device that needs to be controlled with the remote. In effect, it is now like you are holding your remote inches from the device you want to control. And, of course, RF signals work over long distances and around obstacles unlike your IR (infrared) remote."
1,DOA,It charged up the battery and then went dead. 60 1 star reviews is incredibly bad. Do not waste your time with this product. Much better off purchasing this. http://www.amazon.com/Infrared-Receiver-Extender-Cable-STBs/dp/B002JSDHCY/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1289131823&sr=1-1
1,Sometimes works by itself!,"I bought this extender to control a DirecTV receiver that is in a different room from one of the two TVs it is connected to. Unfortunatly it would occasionally turn on the primary TV and receiver in the middle of the night, which was kind of obnoxious since they are both in our bedroom! I assume this was caused by radio interference from a source other than the remote. Other than this glitch it did work better than the native RF mode of the DirecTV remote but after getting out of bed several times to turn the TV and receiver off I decided I really don't need to change channels when watching the remote TV."
4,"So far, it works great.","I have my Tivo on the bottom shelf and line of sight was rather spotty. I purchased the Next gen remote control and it works great. I don't know about the battery life, it's only been 5 days. However, I do wish that the charging light would go out when the battery is charged. That light is really obnoxious. I had to remove the extra battery from the slot and left it in the other slot for safe keeping."
5,It's like magic!,"Not much to say about this product except that it simply works as advertised. I needed to place my Xbox 360 in my bedroom closet so I got the Next Gen remote extender. Pluged it in and BAM! instant control of my console, right through the wall.If you need to hide AV components for any reason, consider this product."
5,cable box in the closet,I have had the Next Generation Remote Control Extender for about 2 months. I have installed in my upstairs hall closet with my cable box. It is awesome. One battery has lasted for these 2 months. I have went outside to the back corner of my house (eventhough i will never need it that far) and it still changed the channel. It does what i wanted it for because i did not want an eye on the tv or wall.
2,Didn't last very long,"This worked fine for a couple of months. Then it started to get increasingly difficult for the base unit to communicate with my satellite receiver. I have the base sitting directly in front of the receiver, about 3 inches away. The base unit is not recharging the little battery unit (the piece that fits inside your remote) like it should and basically renders this thing useless. The instructions were also written by someone whose first language was not English...it is full of run-on sentences and confusing statements. I'll probably try the URC RFS200 PowerPak Bundle w/ MasterControl RF20 and PowerBlaster for $80."
5,Best Product - Exceeded my expectation,"I am having a full home theatre seup including Optoma HD66 projetor.I wanted to cover all my home theatre equipments inside a wooden cabinet. But after closing the doors my home theatre receiver and satellite receiver did not work with my IR remote. Then after searching in Amazon.com I came to know about ""Next Generation Remote Control Extender"". Today I received this product. Directly from the box, I could able to setup without any instruction and now all my remotes works when the doors are closed. Even it works from another room. I am extremely happy about this product and sellers service."
3,ShopCell is great to work with,"I had a problem with my 1st unit, but ShopCell was great to work with in getting the problem resolved."
5,"Great Product, works perfect and extremely easy!","This was so easy to do! whcih is great, I don't have time to deal with difficult setup or lengthy confusing instructions. The longest part was waiting for the initial charge and then it took less than a minute to get it to go. What i love is that I don't have to program codes while toggling remotes and books, etc. Just put the new battery in and you are good to go. Make sure you do charge it as long as it says for the initial charge."
4,Remote Control Extender,"The extender works great, we are using it in the downstairs of our cottage and the other TV is upstairs, works right through the floor! Worth the money!"
3,Doesn't work with all devices,"This RF remote extender works well, BUT it is limited in terms of the devices it is able to control.I have a Philips DVP642 DVD player, an SA8300HD DVR cable box from Time Warner, and a Harman Kardon receiver. The DVD player can't be controlled regardless of the frequency setting (A/B/C on the underside of the RF receiver), and the cable box and HK receiver can't be controlled with just one of these extenders because each requires a different setting (""A"" for cable box, and ""B"" for Harman Kardan receiver). Unfortunately, as good as it is, it doesn't allow me to control all my components inside the cabinet with a single frequency setting. This is a limitation that can only be overcome with having two of these devices so that one can set a different setting on each one of them. Still, you may not be able to control components that don't respond to any frequency setting."
3,"Perfect for houses, not that good for high-rises","This is a perfect product if you live in a house (not much interference). I give this product 3/5 just because of the amount of interference it collects. If you live in a high-rise building (which is my case), with a lot of wireless networks, wireless phones...etc. It was not that easy to set it up to reduce the noise caused by all these signals. I had to reduce the range (only few feet from the other side of the wall) and with the antenna length reduced to the minimum."
4,It works,Only problem I had was placing the receiver/transmitter where it could work in a small closet. Had to be far enough away for beam to reach two devices.
2,Did not work in Moxi DVR remote,"This product did not work in the two Moxi remotes I tested using both battery positions. It did work in the TV and DVD/VCR remotes I tried, but I wanted it for the Moxi. Unfortunately, the seller (not Amazon) does not accept returns on electronics."
5,Worth every penny,"Works surprisingly well. I have to admit I was a little skeptical, how could a battery in the remote replicate the ir signal? I still don't know, but it works perfectly. I have my system in the garage and the speakers are located on my backyard deck, so up until now I had to run into the garage every time I wanted to lower the volume or change the station or cd. No longer, not only does it work flawlessly, the range is really quite excellent. I was able to lower the volume from about 125' away! The set up was simple- replace one battery in your remote with the supplied battery/transmitter- and connect the saucer near the component you wish to control(either in front of it or near it with the included ir cord that sticks to the components ir 'eye') and you are all set. Took 3 minutes to set up (took longer to get everything out of the box). Highly recommended!"
1,didnt work with direct tv HD receiver,easy set up. but didnt work with direct tv HD receiver. gave it away. money down the drain.
1,Will not work and cannot be returned,"I ordered this product and tested it with my remote.It would not work at all and when I requested a RMA, it was declined because the unit came in a sealed plastic cover. I had to open the plastic cover to test the unit. No returns if the cover was opened.I wasted my money."
1,Does not work with AT&T Uverse,"I'm sure this product works well with certain cable providers, but we have AT&T U-Verse and this does not work with their cable box. Now I'm out the cost. Check to make sure this will work with your provider first."
3,"Clever, not long lasting.","I cannot stress how great this is for anyone needing this type of device. I have all my ugly electronics in the basement, (Motorola cable box, Yamaha components, etc) where they cannot communicate with the remotes upstairs. Now with the RF battery in the remotes, and the base unit facing the components (15' away) in the basement, all commands for volume, source, power and channel selection can be effortlessly made anywhere in my 2200 sq. ft. multi story home. There are speakers everywhere, so this has greatly enhanced system usability. The setup took minutes, and has no lag issues with my equipment. The battery lasts months before needing recharging. The only problem is it did not last a year."
2,Great Idea - May work great on some remotes,This may work well on some remotes...my Universal Remote was only two batteries so it did not work well with 1 battery and the sudo battery. Great Idea and may work better with more than 2 batteries.
5,Great product! Great Price!,"This little unit is very simple to set up and use. Works excellent. If you are looking for a basic way to control your hidden A/V equipment without all of the IR repeater wires and technical setups then this is it. I installed this unit inside my linen closet where my Sony Tuner and CD changer are, installed the RF battery (after charging it) into my Sony remote and ""boom"" - I am now able to control the equipment from anywhere in my house! No need to spend alot of money if you want just a simple and effective way to control your hidden equipment."
5,Closed doors and it works,I have Comcast cable and use a 3 year old MacBook. Comcast could not suggest anything over the phone that would allow me to close my cabinet doors and still have the remote work. After much research I bought this device. It worked out of the box and I love it. I have had it for 1 month.
5,remote extender,Excellent product!!! Have tried several other type's and this is the best of them all. Easy to set up and excellent response to all remote comands. Only unknown is battery life.
5,works as promised,"The product is not easily understood based on the website, but I took a chance, as I needed a solution for the DVR and DVD player that was moved to a closet.Once the unit arrived, it was easier to understand and easy to set up. It works great - I can change channels/record using the DVD, play/pause the dvd player with the closet door closed. Life is much simplier now."
5,Does what it says it will do!,"There are a lot of mixed reviews for this item. I almost did not buy it because of some of the bad reviews. I am glad I did though. I have direct TV and it works great for me. I put the battery in and had to take it out and put the battery it came with in last to make it work. Plus, save you self the time and order the extra eye piece for your units. It just works better with them! They don't stick great but I use a piece of tape. All of my stuff is now in a closest on the other side of the house. Couldn't be happier!"
2,Worked well for only a short time,"I was pleased when i purchased this product. It worked as promised, and although it was slightly inconsistent in response, the only real issue was the battery had to be changed(it appeared) every few days. However after a month or so it's range is only about 10 feet,and will not go through walls. This is with a new regular battery and a freshly charged transmitter battery.Someday one of these products will work consistently, they all have problems."
5,worked as advertised,"Have had no problems. I read other reviews that said the instructions were not as clear as they might be, but I found no problems with them. Very simple to install and worked as advertised. I would & have recommended to friends."
4,works well,Works well. Had to experiment at bit with different settings. Will sometimes just start changing channels on it's own. I would use it again.
5,Works great! Very happy!,I wish I would have bought this 2 years ago. Works great with my Tivo HD. I hide my Tivo in a bedroom closet - but I've always had to leave the door open to be able to use the remote. I've only had this a week - but it allows me to keep the door closed - and still change channels. Instructions said to charge batteries for 24-36 hours - I went with 24 - and everything's working perfect. Added benefit I didn't realize - I can change the channel with the remote under the covers (very nice on a cold night).
5,Great Product,"I got this because other universal remotes have problem with Comcast remotes. My new IOgear 3D wireless HD transmitter/receiver has a IR blaster that is useless, this took care of the problem. (I won't go into ALL the problems there are with the 3D IOgear here!)Simple, but ingenious idea!"
2,Does not work with Directv receivers,"Product would not work with any of my HD or SD Directv receivers. My 15 year old RCA extender works fine with these Directv products. Digging deeper, found other reviewers with the same issue. DO NOT BUY if you have a DirecTv product.Bought the Radio Shack extenders (which are based on the old RCA technology) and they work just fine.Returned this to Amazon."
2,Worked for a while,Variable response time will drive you crazy. Product worked for about 6 months and ceased working.
2,Failed after 4 months.,"Got this 4 months ago and it worked great until 2 weeks ago. Now the red lights on the front blink to show that it has a signal, but the base unit doesn't emit any signal. I was able to plug in the wired extender LED and that is working for now. I was initially very impressed by this product, but after seeing other one-star and two-star reviews on here where they've had the same problem, I'm now not so impressed."
5,Excellent Product,"I am completely satisfied with this prodect. The price was resonable and the performance is flawless. I was using a Recoton remote extender and, for some reason, it just wouldn't work in my master bedroom. This unit works great in my master bedroom. With the transmitter replacing one of the batteries in the remote controller, it's also easier to use than my Recoton unit.Also, I don't have to have the receiver directly in front of my DriecTV DVR. I just have it off to the side and it still works every time."
4,Worked well but then stopped......SOLUTION!,"This unit worked reasonably well for about 3 months then began behaving erratically, finally stopped working altogether with my Logitech 676. I tried replacing the RF battery from the charger but no luck. THE SOLUTION: a fresh set of AAA batteries plus the units RF/battery unit. Even though the AAA cells were working they were showing ""Replace or Re-charge"" when I checked them with my battery checker. A fresh set of AAA cells brought the Next Gen unit back to full operation. It apparently needs a complete set of strong batteries in the Logitech Remote to generate a sufficient RF signal to the base unit. The Next Gen unit now is working as well as it did initially."
2,Not impressed...,"I purchased this RF remote extender and an extra battery transmitter.In either of the two locations, I have very limited success. I have to hold the remote a special way and only in one or two positions at both locations. This is not a product I would recommend.Location #1 has only a framed wall between the transmitter and receiver. Location #2 has a block wall between the two... in either case, this product should work a lot better."
2,Battery doesn't last,"Gave this product a shot. I was surprised by two things. First, it worked as advertised. Second, the batteries would not last one evening. This was a killer for me. I let the batteries charge over 24 hours before use. Each time I tried to use the device it would stop working after 3 hours due to low battery. Also, for some reason, the IR extenders failed to stick well to my gizmos, increasing frustration with the product."
4,Works well but conflicts with some things.,"This does work well and just like the description says and I am very pleased.I do have one problem and this conflicts with my antenna rotor with also has remote control. With no set wayI can figure out, some button presses using this with my HD TiVo causes my antenna to rotate fully to one sidemessing up my TV signal. I had to wrap my antenna rotor controller in tin foil to stop it from happening.Other than this issue, I am completely happy and would recommend this and plan to buy another for myselfsoon."
5,Best Extender I've Ever Used,I've used many remote extenders before and this one is by far the best I've used.Not only does it have a fantastic range. I does not have an external transmitter sitting by the television. Since it is all self contained it looks great.I'm using it with a Verizon Fios HD-DVR going between floors and multiple walls to about 30 feet and it works great.I highly recommend this product to anyone.Enjoy!
5,Amazing and Very Useful Gadget,"I spent a lot more money on a Universal Remote Control brand remote and extender that does not work nearly as well as this little gem. As far as ease of use goes, you just plug in the IR repeated and replace one of your batteries in your current remote.Apparently the thing picks up the stray electrical signals that trigger the IR on a regular remote control and broadcast them to the remote unit which amplifies them and sends them to the IR emitter on the base unit. Very clever.One minor point, I wish battery life was a bit longer, but that is a minor point."
3,"It works, but poor battery performance","I've had this unit for about 18 months. It works as advertised, controlling a DirecTV box in another room. But, it only works when the specialized transmitter/battery is actually charged. It doesn't seem to hold a charge well and while you're charging it -- guess what, you can't use it."
2,Power is a problem,"When working, this unit did what it was supposed to do. My beef comes from the way it needs those special Nicad batteries. They don't hold a charge very well. And they wear out much too quickly - meaning a purchase of a $10 replacement battery. Got frustrated and just tossed the thing. Bought a $25 Terk unit - it uses all A/C power and works just as well."
4,Remote extender.... works great!!!,"This product works exactly as advertised.... be sure to follow the directions and charge the transmitter/battery for the full 24-36 hours though. I stopped after about 20 hours and ran into problems with inconsistent remote performance. When I switched to the 2nd battery (that did charge the whole time), the remote worked perfectly.Great product!!!"
5,Works great!,"I was looking for a way to keep the baby from playing with the buttons on the electronic equipment, and this device allows me to close the door and still use my remote!Simple, cheap and effective!I was a little unsure about how to use it, even after reading the directions, but a little experimenting worked wonders!"
5,Complete surprise,"I setup all my media devices in basement and mounted the Tv in the living room. I was not sure if this product works but when I finished installation, to my surprise every thing worked like magic. I am impressed with this product. I used it from second floor and it worked as well. There is no lag."
1,Waste of money,"We got a new cabinet which required a RF remote system. Bought this. It requires you to replace one of the batteries with their battery (likely an antenna) and the other unit on the cable box. I got inconsistent results and finally just do not use it. I used to have a Logitech that worked well until the kids messed with it, thought I would save some money with this one. Simply put, it did not work well."
2,NOT VERY GOOD,"VERY LOW DISTANCE,DID NOT GO THROW WALLS VERY WELL. WE COULD ONLY GET THREW ONE WALL AND GO ABOUT 40 FEET FROM DVR THREW ONE WALL"
3,The battery replacement is a hassle,"I have a lot of problems trying to get a response out of the cable receiver. I don't know if the emitters are the problem or the New Gen, the change of channels inside the unit does not make any difference. The battery change and the charging are very inconvenient ."
3,Works - kind of,"It's pretty finicky. I have to have the little sensor in the exact right place for the remote to be able to catch it. Lots of getting up and moving around the room to try to get the sensor to ""see"" the remote. When it works we get all excited. When it doesn't, we complain that we'd be better off with a regular entertainment center where you can easily access all the gadgets!"
5,Works with Harmony 650,"Not sure what type of sorcery is involved her, it doesn't seem like it should work, but it does and so far the range is great in our nearly 2000sqft ranch. I installed the av equipment in the basement an from the furthest corners it works. My only complaint is with the little corded sender that it doesn't quite stay in place, but some better sticky tape should fix that."
3,Does not work with AT&T U-verse,"This product worked fine with my DVD player, but not with my AT&T U-verse set top box. I'm not sure why, but I tried many different things and it just wouldn't work. So if you are not using U-verse, I would highly recommend it. But if you are using U-verse, check their returns policy because it may not work for you."
4,Amazon- please correct product description - no 3-eye emitter included,"It works as advertised. However, Amazon should correct the section under the product description that says ""What's in the Box."" It clearly states that there is a 3-eye emitter included in the box; however, upon opening the actual package, it includes only a ONE-eye emitter and says on the included directions that in order to control multiple components, you must purchase the three-eye emitter separately. This is a minor frustration considering how awesome the product is in general."
3,Great Technology,"I really like the product concept. I works perfectly when it works. Over the past 2 years I have bought 3 of these units. Unfortunately 1 of the units just stopped working. I should point as well, that a couple of friends have experienced the same failure problem and threw the unit out. The second one is still working and the most recently purchased one is operating perfectly. If you have problems good luck, don't expect the manufacturer to do anything. I have sent 2 emails asking if there was a repair depot,a return process, or warranty program. There has been no response whatsoever. While the product and the basic technology is great I am not sure how long they will continue to work. If either of the remaining two units stop working I will be looking for a different product"
1,hardly ever worked,I tried using it for my cable TV and it just plain hardly ever worked. Bad quality. I gave up and just leave the closet door open to change the channel.
3,Does not work with Uverse,"I am sure this product works well since I have read many positive reviews, but it does not work with AT&T's Uverse box. Since more and more households are adopting this service, there should be soe type of warning about that problem."
5,It's great when someone invents something so useful,"This thing was exactly what I needed to set up a TV on the wall by myself and hide the components in the closet. I wasn't sure how it was all going to work, but this thing is perfect. In a cramped closet space it controls all of the components when I use my universal remote. Even though it is only a couple of inches away from the components and they are stacked on top of each other, I never have a problem. Great invention!"
3,remote controle gets stuck browsing menue.,"my husband says the battery but we haven't exactly figure it out yet. it communicate with comcast remote control smooth except it gets stuck for 10, 20 seconds few times a day."
5,Amazing,"I bought this with extremely low expectations. It works way beyond what I wanted. I have had it for over a month on the same battery charge. Works as well or better than the Verizon remote for the Fios box. It looks stupid, but works great."
5,Great Remote Control Extender,This thing is awesome best remote control extender on the market. If you want to install your cable box and DVD player in a closet or another room this thing will do the job.
1,A waste of money.,"This booster only works if you change the 2/3 battery every day. After trying every location and position possible, I discarded it and bought the Microsmith Hot-Link. It doesn't try to switch IR to RF and then back again to IR. Too Mickey Mouse!"
4,"Works, and works well",Bought a radioshack piece of junk before I found this. It allows me to have a flat screen tv hanging on the wall in one room and control the components located in another room. This means no visible cords in the room with my tv. The unit allows my remotes to respond just as they normally would.
1,Does not work with AT&T u-verse,"I bought this to use with AT&T; u-verse, and it just does not work.I've tried every setting on the saucer, and all battery positions for the transmitter in the remote and it does not work.Read the message boards for this item, other users experience the same difficulty."
1,Next Generation Remote Control Extender,"The product concept is great but the unit does not seem to work work with all remote control units. Specifically, I purchased the unit to work with a Harmony H659 universal remote and it does not work with this unit. However, it does work with the Dish Network remote that the H659 replaces. In addition, the ""operating instructions"" are very poorly written, although they really aren't necessary if the product worked."
2,stoped work after 3 months,Well it worked great for the first 3 months and then it just stopped.Ok I got it working good again.It turned out it was the original remote controller that had a problem.Diff remote and it works great.
4,Works Great!,Works as stated and battery life seems to be very good as well. Only a few issues with signal not being picked up over the couple of months I have had it.
3,Not what it claims,"I mounted a TV on the wall in my bedroom. I bought this product so I could hide my DVR behind the TV and be able to switch channels. It worked, but extremely SLOW! It also required me to have to aim the remote EXACTLY at the device. There are several settings on this. I have tried all, but it may work better once I try to adjust it to the exact setting. So far, I am not impressed. I have relatives that have this same item and it works perfectly for their set up."
2,Does not work with Time Warner remote and Samsung remote,This product did not work with my universal Time Warner remote and did not work with my Samsung TV remote. It did work on the satellite remote.
1,did not work with time warner atlanta 8300,returned this as it did not work with time warner cable box atlanta 8300. I then bought the Xantech DL85K Dinky and it worked like a charm.Don't waste you time on this one if you have time warner box
3,A little disappointed,"I'm a little unhappy with this item. First: the saucer shape limit the positioning of it, the only option is to place it over or under (With adhesive tape) a shelve. Maybe with a rectangular shape, it can be stick it to the wall right in front of the equipment that you want to control. Second: The range is very limited with concrete walls. Third: Not all equipment work in the same frequencies, like the AV Receiver and the Cable Box. Fourth: Mine started behaving erratically after just two weeks of use. Today I will test if the emitter do a better job."
1,Just as described--5 months later it does not work. Revised Review,"I have an 8300HD DVR from Optimum, Cablevision and this worked just as described. I just had to change the function to A. I was able to control the TV from a different room and even from outside of the house. I am able to change channels and all other functions of the remote, Volume and turn off/on can be controlled in the same room. No cables, no equipment, everything is locked on a closet. BeautifulI had to go back in edit this review being taht 5 months later the remote was not responding."
5,Great Product,"Works as advertised, Radio Frequency is the way to go. Batteries last a long time. I highly recommend this product to anyone."
5,"Don't think, just buy it","This thing just works ... through thick wooden cabinets, around and through walls, nothing stops it. Not all remotes like the NextGen battery, so try a different remote if your does not work. When you get it set up, you will grin ear to ear."
4,Next gen remote,This worked fairly well for my dvd/vcr remote but did not work in the directv remote.
4,"Great Product-Tried Others,,","I tried the Terk Technologies LF-IRX Leapfrog Remote Control Extender and it was great at first but after about 1 month, it was awful.. We had to wait a real long time for it to ""sync"". This one was instant... The charging of the battery is the only thing I fear so far.. Not sure how long they last but this TV I use it on gets very little viewing time so I should be all set."
2,Doesn't work concsistenty,I bought this product based on the reviews I read on Amazon. I had problems getting it to work and called the company for support. They did help me and the product worked for awhile but now it works inconsistently and I have had only for about 3 weeks. It has become too frustrating and I hope I can return it. I have a Pioneer Plasma TV with a Panasonic home theater system that includes a DVD player and VCR plus I have a comcast HD cable box. My universal remote was a Harmony (logitech) model 550. I also tried using the next generation with my comcast remote but I still had inconsistent performance. I am sorry but I was disappointed in this product.
2,Not For All Equipment,I ordered a unit for my daughter to control her DirecTV receiver rom her bedroom. The unit seemed to work well initially so I ordered a second unit for my bedroom. Within a few days the first unit started to malfunction requiring constant relocation of the extender. Some days it works well other days it does not. The second unit for my room did not work at all. It would not control the Vizio LCD television at all. It worked off-and-on with the other equipment but eventually got be too much a pain so I boxed it up and threw it in the closet.For the money I would not recommend these units.
4,Good buy for the price,"We really weren't sure before ordering the product if it would work to suit our purpose, but it truly has. We mounted our flat screen tv, and then wanted to hide the cable hd box and vcr in our closet and it works great. Of course you still have to keep a separate remote handy for the dvd player, but still works great."
2,Didn't work for us,"After getting this home and getting it set up, it would not work. Went on the manufacturers site and found out it didn't even work with our Harmony Remote...sent it back. Make sure you check our the manufacturers site for info on your specific remote."
2,It worked great for all of two months,"It was easy to install, everything that was written about it in the positive reviews was true EXCEPT after two months of sitting on top of my fridge, it suddenly died on me. I called the vendor's customer service line (which isn't open on weekends) and was told that they only have a 30 day guarantee and that I should call Amazon to see if they could replace it. That didn't work out for us - we missed Amazon's product warranty period.Now we're looking for a replacement of better quality. We're willing to pay more for a product that we will be able to use for years.If you're thinking about buying this product, SAVE YOUR MONEY, and buy something that's better built."
2,Does not work well with uverse receiver,The extender works well with other units but not with the uverse receiver. Tried every possible setting but the performance is erratic at best. Having to press the button 20 or more times before anything happens is common place.
4,exactly what I wanted,"I already had my DVR wired to several TV's around the house with switch boxers at each TV for DVR, Cable Box, or Antenna. All I needed was this little device so that I could control the DVR from any room in the house. Once I charged the battery, it worked right away. I do wish it had multiple ir emitters, but I can't complain for the price. I am worried about the life of the rechargeable battery. I've been using it for a month and so far I haven't had to recharge. I only use the remote for watching tv about 2-3 hours each day. This repeater is smaller and works better that a previous brand I purchased at a store and then returned."
2,How Does it Work????,"It looks great. But, looks aren't everything. I purchased this in part because of the other reviews. I am unable to configure this device to work on my Samsung 40"" LCD TV. If I'm doing something wrong, it must be very wrong. I'll keep trying because I really need a remote extender, but for now....not so good. Two stars because it looks cool."
5,Best remote controler I have had!!!,I tried another remote controler and it worked off and on the Next Generation Remote Control Extender works every time and it is not out in the open.
2,Poor signal strength,"May work well in homes with wood or sheetrock internal walls but in homes with block work, ""NO WAY"", I could not get the remote to work 55 feet away in the bedroom. Tried it closer with less walls and it was still intermittent. NOT for cement/block wall houses.Am now trying another type/brand from a client, will update this if possible."
2,Does not work with Harmony 650 Remotes!,This product does not work with Harmony 650 Remotes. Make sure you verify if this will work with your remote before buying.
5,No Brainer,"Received this today. Popped it out of the packaging, plugged it in and it worked just as advertised the first time. I have Directv and checked the discussions prior to ordering. Strangely enough you need to put the transmitter/battery in the slot first for everything to work correctly. I guess that puts the transmitter closer to the IR emitter on the remote. In my set up, I have two floors electrical wiring and plumbing between the unit to be controlled and the remote. Works fine."
5,works very well,Works flawlessly with DirecTV hr24.I failed in my first setup attempt because I had the battery / transmitter backwards. Seems like a stupid thing but it is not and if you are not very careful you can make the same mistake. My guess is many of the people saying it doesn't work with DirecTV failed in the same way I did at first.Upon fixing that the unit works wonderfully. No delay between button presses and the unit installs out if the way with a very long ir transmitter emitter.I would highly recommend.Charge the batteries often comes with a spare) to prolong life.
1,Piece of garbage,"The socket into which you plug the emitter cable broke loose within weeks, rendering it useless. Giant waste of time and money."
1,Range 1.5 feet,Bought the unit for Christmas 09 as a gift for my wife so she could use a TV in her home office. It worked fine across the width of our bedroom. In August 09 it started acting up then just plain would not work. Did a few experiments and found that the base unit still worked but only if the unit was placed within a foot and a half of the cable box. This was not practical and the unit is useless now for our application.MikeG
1,Can't get it to work,"Well had a hard time getting it to work. Sometime it works, other times it doesn't. I tried all three bandwidths and nothing seems to fix it.I have a LCD large screen TV, a cable box/dvr and a dvd player and a Onkyo receiver.I've the got the eye pointing at my components from 15 feet away, as they recommend, and it works one evening, but you come back the next day and its out. I haven't had a lot of time mess around with it, but even my tech savvy son can't keep it on task."
4,Actually works exactly as advertised,"Set the base up, put the little battery in the remote, does exactly what it says. I use it with my Tivo remote, and the only problem is if I'm in the same room as the Tivo, it seems to work less reliably, I think because its confused by two signals, one from the remote and one from the extender. Remote actually works best if you aim it away from the Tivo when you are in the same room. Other than that absolutely shocking how well it works."
2,Works with only a few controllers,I purchased this item to control a UVerse box.. It did not work at ALL. I tried it with a cable box and it works great. For the newer ATT Uverse box I had to buy the X10 Pro Powermid ir extender. It works with all control boxes including the newer ones.
1,Broke after 13 months,Works fine for the first 12 months but broke at month 13. Does anyone have any warranty info on this product as trying to see if my credit card will cover it as it doubles the warranty?Not sure if I would buy another as down $50 bucks...
1,Remote dies with the 2/3 battery and transmitter,"I couldn't get this to work. I charged both 2/3 batteries for 36 hours, but when I put one in the transmitter, and then the transmitter into the AA sleeve, the remote doesn't do anything - not even turn on the lights, so it's as if it's out of batteries. I used a voltage tester and it turns out the batteries are only charging up to 1 volt (instead of 1.5 v) but when I insert them in the transmitter the voltage drops to 0, as if the transmitter was shorted.I called NextGen and they basically said I had to return it and there's nothing they could do about it ... well that sucks."
3,Use more remote batteries than just one AAA.,"If the remote used on the unit your are powering needs only one battery the included 2/3 size battery won't last long enough. It needs to be coupled with at least one more battery to be effective. Therefore, if the product you wish to use this on calls for only one battery consider using a universal that has more battery requirements.Other than that observation, the product preforms as advertised."
1,poor performance,"I mounted my tv on the wall and decided to put all of my other stuff in the closet about 3 feet away from the tv. This thing seemed to be exactly what I needed to make it all work so I bought it and anxiously waited it's arrival. I charged it correctly and hooked everything up and it worked intermittent at best. Sadly, it just does not do what it says it can do. You have to have a direct line of sight. Unless my walls are made out of some anti-rf signal super material that they had in 1961 when it was built. Wouldn't buy it again. I should've just bought a shelf. It's been awhile and I still don't have this problem solved."
5,Works Great!,"I have an old house with a built-in cabinet that is 'arount the corner' from the living room. I bought this cuz my ir remote of course does not go around courners. It works great. Swapped out the AA battery from my remote with their recharable replacement and placed the ir repeater on the front of my cable box and blam! my remote works from anywhere in the house. I have been using it for months.Negatives:My only complaint is that the IR repeater that attaches to the unit that will be controled, looses it's sticky-ness after a few moves.. and I currently have it scotched taped to the front of the cable box, perhaps a dab of elmers glue would fix that.So in all I would DEFINATELY recommend this."
1,Terrible,"As others has stated, it has two fatal flaws. One is that it shortens battery life. I had to constantly chase batteries to keep this going. Another flaw is that it wont work with my Directv HD DVR receiver. If I had to do it over again, I would run away from this product. One star."
1,Doesn't work with U-Verse,"Do not buy if you are trying to use with U-verse. It does not work. Worked for my TV, Blu-Ray, A/V receiver, but not U-verse. Well it has to work with everything, or it's worth nothing."
1,Doesn't really work,This is a junky little device. Batteries don't last very long and it is ugly. I would not want to buy this in the future...you can get IR universal remotes that do the trick much better.
1,trash,This item made its way into the trash can very quickly... The directions were terrible and we couldn't get the dumb thing to work. I guess you get what you pay for and I'll have to spend a little more money to get something that actually works.
2,Remote Extender,I followed the directions to a T and cannot get devise to work. The light on the unit flashes but no light shows on the IR sender. Either it does not work or it is too hard to set up to be understood. I have not called for assistance because I have spent too much time on this item allready.
5,Works Beautifully - Great Product,"Bought this after reading reviews on several products. We have an Scientific Atlanta cable box from Cox Communications that we wanted to place beneath our kitchen island. We have a high-definition TV on top of the island. When the product arrived, we installed the transceiver and battery in our remote, using the A setting, placed the ""satellite"" piece on the shelf under our island with the cable box, and everything worked perfectly. No problems, and a nice clean granite counter top on the island. :-)"
5,Works like a champ!!,Bought this item to control my satelite dish converter. Placed unit in basement and wired the converter to power all my cable connections thru-out the house. Works like a champ!!! No disappointments here.
2,"Maybe worth the money, but not worth the hassle...!","When first purchased, it worked good. but after a few weeks, the unit would freeze up, not respond to button commands which untimately lead to getting off the couch to open the closet door and opperating directly with the cable box. Sometimes the time time frame would be 15 mins, other times it would freeze up and not work till the next morning. And, from my experience it always seemed to lock up in the late evening hrs, after 8-9pm EST. In the long run, you pay cheap, you get a cheap product. I'm now online researching a better product. Think hard on this one."
4,Good Solution,The extender is a good solution to removing my video equipment from in front of my television. Now it does not have to be in line of sight and not loose control. I am pleased that it works well and easy to set up.
2,Worked great until it didn't!,"Setup was easy, but make sure you read the instructions.Pros:I bought and installed this for a senior couple who are handicapped and needed to be able to watch their cable box and DVR in their bedroom. It took me about thirty minutes to set it up and run the cable from the family room to their bedroom TV. The unit worked on a Cox DVR from the bedroom just as advertised.Cons:It stopped functioning two weeks later at 11:00pm, causing a middle of the night call out. The batteries and transceiver appear fine, I believe the main unit's power supply has failed as there are no lights and no response from it.Now I have to refund the clients money and try to get my money back, as well as try to find another unit to do the same job."
4,Amazing,"I was skeptical when I read the description of this product and could not believe that it would perform as stated, but I have to say, this thing is amazing. I have a Comcast DVR that is hooked up to 5 TV's spread out through a 3300 sq ft house and it works like a charm. You have to disable the IR part of the remote (I covered the sender on the remote with black electrical tape) or it will confuse the DVR or whatever you are using. Batteries last a long time. I would buy this again and have recommended it to many friends."
4,tough set up for AT&T Uverse,"I started w/ Comcast and it worked great. fed up w/ Comcast, I switched to Uverse. it worked fine at first....strang but true...then it faded. So I figured something in the device failed and I bought a replacement. did not work. I thank Gidion's review, specifically to not extend the antenna too far and that it does not work too close. Okay, so reading the reviews it's clear people have played around with this thing a fair amount. So, I've not taped aluminum foil inside the cabinet that houses the Uverse DVR and it helps....strange but true. I can't wait until my wife sees it..."
5,Pays for itself,"A long time ago, I used a pyramid type device to extend the remote. That required a recieving device near the remote TV. With this, there is a mini reciever that takes the place of one of your remote batteries. Brilliant design! After charging the battery, it took about 5 minutes to install, and away I went channel surfing.Here's how it pays for itself. I have a ""spare"" cable box installed in a closet next to the network router and my slingbox. I also ran a cable downstairs to the spare bedroom, then tapped off of that cable to the living room. So that one cable box is connected to 2 rooms and my slingbox. at $6.99 per month, I'm saving almost 14 bucks per month by not having to rent 2 more cable boxes. In 2 months, this will pay for itself!!!"
2,Didn't work with DirecTV and Logitech700 Remote,"I couldn't get it to work with my Logitech 700 remote and Directv infra red. Spent about 4 hours trying to get it setup and configured based on troubleshooting here and other forums. Emailed their support but they never replied, so I sent it back and amazon issued a full refund."
1,Worst Product I've bought in a Long Time,I only had this product for a couple of months and then it started acting wierd that from day to day I didn't know whether it was going to work or not. It would just stop responding to remote commands. I would have to go to the base unit and remove the battery and then either replace the battery or just put it back into the unit for it to start working again. This started happening every day until I got tired of it and ordered a TiVo Slide Remote which works extremely well. I will never buy another NextGen product again.
1,Very poor performance,"Purchased this unit to run my Directv receiver from the bedroom of my motorcoach with the receiver in the front of the coach 30' away. The performance was very sporadic and undependable. The unit would work for one or two remote inputs, then stop. Switching channels on the IR receiver would result in one or two more inputs working as it should, then it would stop. Changing the position of the IR emmitter or receiver base had no impact. Changing the position of the transmitter battery in the Directv remote had no impact. Overall, I was very disappointed in the performance (or lack thereof) of this device. While it may work very well with other component remotes, I would not recommend it for use with a Directv remote."
1,Does not work!,"I purchased this item after reading all the glowing reviews, unfortunately for me I missed the review that was posted a while back in which the poster stated that it does not work with AT&T U-Verse. Indeed, this is correct. I found out the tough way. Too bad, I had high hopes for it. It worked just three times out of many, many attempts pushing buttons on the remote. So if you have U-Verse, stay away from this!"
1,A Disappointment,I purchased this product to use with my DirecTv controller. It simply did not work. My emails to the company went unanswered. What a disappointment.
1,Stopped working soon after first use (see update),"The Next Generation Remote Control Extender is a great idea. I ordered it, but soon after I started it using, it stopped working. I recharged the batteries and swapped them, and I changed the location of the battery transmitter in the remote. That didn't help. I returned it for a refund.Update: After reading many positive reviews I decided to try another one. This one has been working as advertised.Second Update: The second unit quit working. I gave-up on it and trashed it."
3,Jury is still out,"Judgement on this product is still pending, til I get more use of it from a room that is not used a lot. First setup was on a remote with RF feature that was on, and I neglected to change it back to IR. Once I caught onto that, it seems to work OK. But still seems to be sensitive to where it is pointed, and the receiver is only 25 feet away thru one interior wall. Based on other reviews I expected the range to be much better. Will continue to experiment. As of now, I am not disappointed but not totally impressed."
5,This is the deal for remote extenders.,Love these. My only complaint is there is no way to tell the 418MHZ from the Blue 433 MHZ transmitter except for the colors. It is not written on the Case. Red is 418MHZ and Blue is the 433 MHZ Make sure you are ordering the right one. This is the 433 MHZ extender. So if you want to get an extra battery transmitter set for an extra remote you have in another room. Make sure it is the Blue 433 MHZ Battery not the red.
1,It Does not work,"when I saw this product I thought it might be the answer to my problems. The packaging was good, and the instructions were fairly simple. I followed the instructions to the letter, and there was nothing I could do to make this device work. When I pushed the buttons on my remote, I could see the lights of the unit flashing, but none of the electronic devices responded. I was attempting to control an AT&T u verse TV control box, and a DVD player. I followed all the suggestions provided but nothing made a difference. I have to admit I was extremely disappointed. I read a lot of good reviews about it, and even watched the video which showed the device operating up to 150 feet away. I'm pretty technology savvy, so I don't think it was anything that I did wrong. It just didn't work. Good luck to anyone else who buys it."
1,"Does not work, NexGen doesn't respond","Does not work as advertised, heck, it hardly works at all. It does allow control of the volume and muting so the signal path is fine - the unit just isn't suitable for controlling all equipment.Emailing the company has been a waste of time.My suggestion is to consider buying an RF equipped unit with an RF remote."
5,Great Product......,"I've recently moved all of my A/V equipment in a closet off of the living room, about 25 feet from the tv. The Next Generation remote control extender works great and is incredibly easy to set up. I used the transmitter/battery in my Logitech Harmony 550, works perfect. The best part is there are no wires sticking out anywhere, as with other extenders that require a pickup that must be in plane sight. I highly recommend this product to anyone with an enclosed A/V system."
5,Great Remote Extender!,"This ""Next Generation"" extender truly is an excellent product.It is simple to install and requires no programming...just charge the batteries and go! The instruction manual is only ONE page!I wanted a simple, economical way to have music on my backyard deck, so I got some Yamaha outdoor speakers and this remote extender from Amazon. I hooked up the new speakers to an audio receiver and the FIOS TV box in my basement and installed the remote extender.Now I can listen to tons of digital music channels, and control it all with my FIOS remote from my deck about 40 feet away.I had no problems getting this to work, and a real bonus is that this is ""wife-friendly""; no new remotes to learn, no exposed wiring etc.The manufacturer states on their website to use the 418 Mhz model if you want to control a Verizon FIOS box.Not sure what that is about, because I have the 433 Mhz version and it works just fine.This really is a simple, excellent and inexpensive remote extender...five stars!"
5,Remote Control Extender,"Worked as stated, worked well from a distance. Best remote extender I've owned"
5,Remote Extender,"I needed this for use at my church. We have a rear screen projector that sits about 120 feet away from the control desk which requires someone to make there way though the attic to turn on/off the projector. We prevously had a remote extender that was similar to the days of TV antennnas in that you had to position all equipment just so to get the signal to transmit correctly. Luckily, that equipment was damaged during a remodeling project and forced us to upgrade to this device. Its works amazingly well and functions with my existing remote control just by replacing a single battery with the included transmitter. I was hesitant at first in that I thought the distance might be an issue, but it has worked flawlessy for about 3 months now. I couldn't be more pleased."
4,great idea,This was a great idea. You have your cable box in a enclosed unit with wood between the t.v. control and you....put the Generation Remote in and you no longer have to open the doors to control the t.v. It works so great that our neighbor two houses down had one (he told us about how great it was) and we ended up changing each others channels. Returned one to the co. and they sent us a new one with different numbers to control (kind of like a garage door control unit).
5,Best value and red eye machine,I have this swanky expensive red eye doohickey for my one tv and love this one way better.The engineering of this red eye is amazing. You don't have an extra remote. It uses the same remote that you have. No extra wires going anywhere only just a power cord. The transmitter is also the charger. I am telling you you will be amazed when you get this product
1,Worthless Extender,"I tried it on two of my audio systems and was not able to make it work reliably. I was trying to use it for my Tivo systems, which are very sensitive to direct line-of-site remote pointing, where the slightest angle prevented the Tivo from responding to the remote. Placing the Extender's IR blaster module in front of the Tivo did not work, so, removing the tape, I stuck the blaster right on the front of the Tivo, next to the IR sensor. It worked sometimes but most of the time was very slow or not at all responsive. If it did not work, I'd try to point the remote directly at the Tivo, but because of the battery replacement, even what used to work no longer worked. I thought that, since the Tivo remote used only two batteries, I'd move the unit to my other system (where the programmable remote has 4 batteries) and that, too, did not work well. I could not get the IR blaster to work with my other Tivo and other remote. Do not buy this. Waste of money."
3,Not exactly as promised,"The manufacturer (importer) claims that this will work with almost any remote. How is it that I seem to have two of the ones that it won.t work with? Even when I'm using the remote on my Roku player in the same room as the player it won't work. Apparently the rechargeable battery even screws up the ir function of the remote. I suspect that's because the rechargeable battery is not 1.5v, but actually only 1.2v, which, as a general rule, is not enough to provide adequate power to ir remotes. The manufacturer (importer) claims that it is, but they are absolutely wrong, as anyone who has ever checked the voltage of the worn batteries from a malfunctioning remote will tell you. Every remote I have starts acting up once the voltage drops below 1.4v, so next generations 1.2 v is simply not sufficient ."
3,"clever, works, but not well","I live in a 2-story house and use DirectTv. There are several rooms where I have tvs, so I need some sort of device like this.I've been using it for several months now, and it works, but not real well. What I've found is that I usually have to press each button multiple times before it will register. This is particularly frustrating when you are trying to say key in a channel number, as it usually takes multiple many tries to successfully key in a 3 digit channel. I've tried moving around the receiver, I've keep the batteries well charged etc, but the usability on these things is just pretty low. I guess the signal just isn't strong enough.It's a clever device, too bad it doesn't work better."
5,Works just as advertised - very happy,"I'm extremely happy with this product. Everything is exactly as expected, with one minor exception. The Battery light is supposed to flash only when the battery is charging, and in my experience (I've had the product for about 2 weeks) it never stops flashing. I've not contacted the manufacturer to see if this is a known problem or if something is actually not right, but it's a minor issue that doesn't affect the operation of the unit.I've noticed that sometimes it seems the signal is blocked and occasionally I have to move the remote a bit to get it to respond properly but once again, this is a minor annoyance, not what I would categorize as a flaw in the product. I highly recommend this unit."
4,Best Remote extender I have owned,Get this item and you will not regret it.One shot installation and very simple.Good product and of course Amazon is excellent especially customer support.enjoy
3,Great idea but...,"It is a great idea but works only intermittently for me. My biggets problem is that sometimes it keeps on holding the button down. For example, if I press down arrow, it'll execute down arrow in a loop, until I press some other button. It is not my remote because I saw it on the second remote as well. It may have been some interference issue very specefic to my settings or equipment but at least it did not work perfectly for me.I've my equipment in garage and use this to control Archos TV+ from the living room. The IR signal gets there 95% of the time but sometimes there is just no response, which is very frustrating."
2,poor,It is very difficult to find a position for this thing to work. THe only waty I could get it to work is by using the eye
4,"Great idea, works brilliantly","I bought this device so that I could control my cable box from multiple rooms. It works exactly as described. I have the transmitter in the AA sleeve in my remote, and the receiver/IR emitter hidden under my coffee table. It's a brilliant idea, and works great. The only small problem is that, in fact, it is slightly harder now to control the cable box when in the same room: sometimes when I point the remote towards the box, it does not register. But if I point it away from the box, it works. I've never had a problem with the reception in the other room. In short, it's well worth the $30, and works exactly as advertised."
4,Good Product with proper placement,"The remote extender has worked well for us thus far. Placement of the unit and the eye is critical in getting this unit to work properly. Also, the instructions that are included are a little vague, but the number provided offered excellent tech support and we were able to get it working just fine. Our application is that we have a flat LCD on the wall and our DirecTV receiver is on a shelf behind the wall the TV hangs from so we needed it to go through the wall and access the receiver. So far so good. For the cost, I would recommend this product to anyone........"
5,"This product is brilliant, and easy to setup.","Purchased this item after reading a great professional review. I simply wanted to hide away my cable box behind closed doors, and operate it with my own remote. This works perfectly.It's as simple as installing the transmitter in the battery area. The only other thing that you may need to do is change the switch inside the main unit.I had a few questions, and I emailed the manufacturer. I received an answer within one day.I am thinking that I should have purchased additional transmitters as well.Easy easy easy."
1,Warranty is useless!,Purchased this to control a Motorola cable box. It worked flawlessly for about six weeks then intermittently for a few days before it failed totally. I have repeatedly emailed and called Next Generation's phone number for assistance with this. They have yet to respond to the emails or answer their phone. I called during their business hours only to get a recording stating that the office was closed and to call back during their business hours! I guess it's easy to have a one year warranty if you have no intention of honoring it. I am going to file a claim with the Better Business Bureau. I strongly recommend everyone to avoid Next Generation products.
1,did not work as advertised,"This remote extender worked ok the first week. Then the battery went dead so we put the extra battery that had been charging in the unit for the week. The extender only worked sporatically. Then we charged the original battery for 2 days and put it back in, the unit still only worked sporatically. We have a very old Jensen JDSC-IR100A unit that works just fine (it is at least 6 years old. The drawback is you have to take the ""sending"" unit with you along with it's power in whatever room you go. It also needs ""help"" with the antena, which we easily accomplish by holding onto the antena or having it touch a lamp post of something metal in whatever room we are in."
3,Eats batteries like its candy.,The extender works fairly well. It is tempermental and doesn't always pick up the signal. Very easy to get out of sync also. Worst thing is You have to replace the batteries every couple of weeks.
1,Never worked,"Pretty good with electronics, thought it was the perfect solution but it only worked sporadically at best. Infrared transmitter was very position sensitive on cable box, even when holding it over the receiving area on the box,"
5,Works with DirecTV,I purchased this to replace a current remote extender that stopped working. I charged this as directed and it worked the first time with my DirecTV HD DVR and remote. So far I am very happy with it.
1,Stopped working after 2 months,"I bought the Next Generation Remote Control Extender in late Nov of 2011. My goal is to store my cable box in my cabinet but that never worked. The only way I could get the remote to work is to attach the 'eye ball' outside of the cabinet door. That worked for the first 2 months, but shortly after the 2 month mark the device stopped working. The extender came with 2 batteries and both rechargeable batteries will not seem to recharge. Now the whole device does not work. This product is not worth the aggravation"
1,"Not as advertised-- plus, it doesn't work!","Under ""What's in the Box"", it says that 3 and 6 eye emitters are included. Not in the box (actually, blister wrap) I got-- all it had was a single emitter. But, I decided to go ahead and try it with my Direct TV HR34. Charged up the battery for 48 hours, placed and plugged all the pieces as appropriate, all the proper lights light up when the remote button is pressed-- but it won't control the HR34, either via the emitter or by placing the flying saucer in front of the receiver.So, I tried to take the battery/transmitter out of my remote so I could return it, but the transmitter is actually slightly larger than a AAA battery, and it wouldn't come out of the battery compartment without the help of needlenose pliers. I ended up damaging the casing, so now the piece of crap isn't even returnable. Don't waste your money."
4,it works,it does what it says......My neulion cable box is connected to two tvs in two separate rooms. i needed to control the cable box from both rooms. It certainly did the trick. I would say the range is about 50 ft. If the Extender is on the same floor and the rooms are close together it would work. but if its on a different floor you might want to look for something more stronger.
4,Great Product,"We have tried several other remote control extenders, and this one works the best without a doubt. You can use your regular remote, and it works from all over the house (we have used it up to 30 feet away so far with no problem). Unfortunately our satellite receiver and dvd player are on different IR frequencies, so it can really only work with one of them (whichever frequency we set it on, the other one only works if you aim the controller at the RF receiver itself, so it defeats the purpose in our house as our receivers are in a different room from our TV and DVD player)."
5,Absolutely Awesome,"I feel like I went through all the other types of extenders prior to getting this one and after having it for a few months I still love it. Works with all my destination equipment including a Sony stereo, various DVD players and most importantly the Dish Network box. The Dish box was twitchy at best with the other extenders including those designed specifically for the those boxes. Frequently they'd pick up interference causing them to be non functional. Not so with this extender. It just works..all the time. On the sending side, I am using it with a Sony RM-VL610 Universal remote which is another product I'd recommend. This extender is well worth the extra cost over the other ones."
5,Best of the class,"I've tried the rest, and eventually determined that this is the best.We use this in a restaurant situation where the TV is located some distance from the receiver, and tuning was always a chore involving either shouting or the use of our two-way radios until we purchased this unit.At times there is a small lag when using the remote, but it's negligible.One thing I have noticed and brought to the attention of the staff is that if the remote (which contains the transmitter and miniature battery) is left on top of the cable box - which gets hot while in use - that the battery life will diminish quickly and the transmitter will not work correctly.Luckily, there's a spare battery in the base of the ""UFO""!All around, I recommend this unit highly - and I do so with products very sparingly.."
2,Good while it lasted.,I bought and used this product for a couple of months with success. It suddenly stopped working. I recently bought a X10 POWERMID Remote Control Extender Kit PM5900. Not from Amazon. I got it from the Crutchfield catalog for $50. It seems sturdy and with a 1 year warranty.
2,Great Product but ....,"It works great except that it doesn't work at all with the Scientific Atlanta HD DVR box as promised. Since that was mainly what I bought it for, I returned it. Amazon, as always, gets 5 stars for their easy-to-use return policy."
4,Family Therapy in Clinical Practice by Murray Bowen,"Very good discussion of family systems, and problems and resolutions for dysfunctionality.Family Therapy in Clinical Practice"
1,Accurate but BORING!,"Other than the chapter on the Driods, this book is not worth your time. Better to read Kip Thorne. How the author could have taken such interesting subjects and made them some uninteresting is somewhat amazing. Don't read this!"
5,Great Book,"I am not a huge, or even big Star Wars fan (heck, I didn't even like the first one), but I loved this book. A great concept, very well done. I could not put it down."
4,STILL PROVOKES,Nearly a word-for-word reflection of Oscar Wilde's play from almost a century earlier. Ken Russell's take on this Bible story is framed by his own original narrative that has Wilde and his lover arriving late at a friend's brothel where they are surprised by a staging of his own play that has just been banned in Britain. An oddity that still rankles and provokes with its overt sexuality and sometimes striking imagery.
5,Great Soft-Grip Spatula,"I love the Analon soft-feel utensils for their easy, soft grip and solid build. The bottom half inch or so of the 'bowl"" part of this spatula is floppy, while the rest is stiff. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing for most cooks, but I'm not much of a cook. For my purposes--imprecise, rushed guesswork type ""cooking""--it's a keeper! I'll bet even real cooks will love it!"
1,Do Not Buy,"If the pot doesn't sit just right, it overflows all over the counters and the floors. After three times in as many weeks, I just tossed the piece of junk."
2,Disappointed,"Easy to assemble, but table top was damaged (two chips about the size of a dime). Supplier offered to pick up and replace, but considering the return hassle & intended use, I patched the chips & kept the item."
3,"Good table, but could be better for the price.","After I purchased the first table and assembled it, I noticed that the legs weren't straight. That's because how you connect it to the bottom shelf could result in the legs being at slightly different angles. Unfortunately, making sure the legs come out 90 degree perfect vertical is a challenge with this table and could result in a very slight wobble.I wasn't too concerned about it and it's nothing a little felt pad from a hardware store won't solve, so I've ended up buying three more and am happy with them. Overall, they are pretty sturdy and the quality is okay. I deducted one star for the wobble (not on all of them) and another star for value."
4,Tenchi's in Love!,"I believe this movie is truly sweet. This time, Tenchi meets a girl(Sakuya) in Tokyo. I feel sorry for both Ryoko and Ayeka. Meanwhile, back in the countryside, things are really falling apart. This movie is really wonderful."
1,They did not ship what was promised.,"I wanted a new battery for My Canon camera, but I did not want to pay Canon's high price. Past experience with generic batteries was less than satisfactory, so I passed up an opportunity to purchase a number of generic options in the $5 - $6 price range. Instead, I chose to purchase an Eveready Energizer replacement, ER-D150 from Accessory Genie for about $15. It was worth it to me to pay the extra money to get the Energizer brand. Accessory Genie did not state that they would send a generic equivalent, they stated that they were selling and would ship the Eveready Energizer battery. I just received the shipment. On my packing list, it states that they shipped ""1 ER-D150 Energizer for Canon NB-4L"". But that is a lie. They shipped a generic battery made by Pro Power. This is completely false advertising and is 100% unacceptable. Be Honest and say so if you're selling a generic. I am very, very disappointed."
2,Not for the faint hearted,"This foregin author is obviously full of himself in usingjargon that is beyond the average reader's grasp. This book isintended for a math major as well as a economic historian major. Ifyou're intreagued by this market and would like to read about Kondradeiff's theories, I highly suggest another book. So why 2 stars? The book holds good historical data if you can drudge through the formulas and pompous verbiage."
5,Love this product,"Absolutely love this product and it fits and looks great on my SUV. The directions could use some work to make it easier to install, but I just went online and watched a video of how to do it and it make it much easier. The locking feature is solid as you dont have to worry about someone stealing your board or skis and you can definitely fit multiple pairs of each on this rack. Thule continues to make great products and this definitely fits right in with their great products!"
4,Does the job but painful to install,"Be ready for a lengthy install process. It's easy enough, but takes a lot of time due to the gazillion quarter turns of the hex wrench to install the bracket to the car. Wish they would've supplied a longer hex wrench."
3,Terrible customer service,"I bought the Thule 5401 Snowcat ski rack from a local retailer. I first went to the Thule website and looked at their product fit guide and found that this would fit my 2008 Ford Expedition EL. It has factory rails but no crossbars. The rails happen to be 2"" thick. The bolts that are provided with the rack are not long enough. Went to the local hardware store and bought $16.00 worth of longer bolts to make it work. At the same time, I emailed customer service and told them what the problem was. They said that it should work with provided bolts. Took a picture of the rack sitting on my rails, sent to customer service. 10 days and still have not heard anything from them. I rated this a three because of their poor customer service. I do like the product though. Would have rated it a 5 if the bolts weren't too short and had I gotten a response to my email."
5,Thule Snowcat Ski Rack,"Good product and was as represented. Reasonable price. No problems, but shipping was a little slow due to Christmas season and shipping distance."
3,Doesn't fit wide side rails,This seemed like a cool idea but does not come close to fitting an explorer's side rails. I have a 2007 Sport trac and it does not work with it at all.
4,"If you're interested in anarchy, it's a good place to start.","This is an excellent resource, but it has three problems. First, the explosion in works requires it to be updated. Second, many of the listed works are extremely difficult to locate. Thirdly, I wish it would have contained more on the idea of freedom and liberty."
5,greatest movie of the 70`s,"In the 70`s when this came out, I bet I saw it 10 times until another movie come to the theater, I would reccomend every 1 get a copy and watch it. They are not costly at all on Amazon"
4,Fleas flee!,Great for combing out loads of fleas. Long handle is much better for control and grip than the little mini flea combs. All metal construction makes it sturdy.
1,Completely dissatisfied,"Product ordered is NOT what was received, so I have been suffering a complete run-around trying to send it back. I have typically had no problems with products ordered, but my excitement over being able to get the pictured item was gone when the product arrived at my home. I'm still awaiting the return label so I can send it back, and that has been a challenge all its own!"
1,A WASTE OF TIME - Worth a ZERO!,"Granted, I'm a horror flick fanatic, but ""Pumpkinhead"" is no horror flick. It's a frivolous, boring, mindless, junk-filled, silly (and stupid) concoction of guavo, manure, stale dog food, and buzzless warm beer all brewed into one totally useless sick cinema sampler suited for oblivion. And that's the best thing I can say about it. Case closed. Carve this pumpkin till death do you part. A total ""0"". The box you ask? I've removed it from my collection. Remember...""one bad apple..."""
4,"Good Acting, Good Story, Good Gore, Good Movie!",Lance henriksen kicks butt in this movie about a hillbilly legend. All of the characters are well played and the storyline gets very involved. It was kind of a surprise because I figured the movie to be pretty week but then I saw it and was glad I purchased it. If you're a fan of the predator or aliens you'd love this movie and the scene at the end is unbelievable. Pumpkinhead is a must see.
3,Ok I guess,"My biggest gripe with this movie is that it credits Richard Weinman with the story when in actual fact it originally appeared in an old warren magazine EERIE #11. In fact, the cover depicts the same creature, same color in the same type of swamp. It seems movie makers today (1980s to the present) can only steal ideas, not create them. Unless you happened to have grew up in the 1970s, loving comic books, you won't be privy to how much today is swiped in both books and movies and entertainment in general."
3,THE CURSE IS SET FREE!!!!,To avenge the death of his son in an accident with some city bikers a farmer consults an evil which with dark powers he digs up a corpse and she transforms it into a demon that will kill those its called to kill and anyone who gets in its way!! the demon commits the murders on the city people but the survivors run about in search of help but are turned away by all for fear of the curse and its only up to the farmer who lost his son to call of the curse of PUMPKINHEAD!!!! with suspense and realistic creature affects this is for any horrorfan!!
3,"Cool monster, mediocre skill","This is the classic example of a movie made for it's special effects. I must admit, however, that they're good. I liked Lance Henrikson, but the best asset of the movie, of course, is the monster. The creator also helped make the beasts in ALIENS, which is of no surprize, considering the monster's semblance to those creatures. Despite good technical credits, the scares are few and lame and the timing seems a little off. The movie is also a little too short. However, the final shot in the movie was cool."
5,"ENTERTAINING,STORY PLOT, GREAT INTENSITY!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","WELL THE ONLY THING I DISSAGREE ABOUT IS 1 SHOULD HAVE BEEN PART 2 AND 2 SHOULD HAVE BEEN PART ONE BUT I SUGGEST IF U SEE ,U NEED TO OBTAIN BOTH, I FEEL U WILL LOVE IT, AS IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE, A WINNER WITH ME, MOST HORROR FILMS THESE DAYS HAVE TOO MUCH EFFECTS THAT SUBTRACT FROM THE MOVIE, FAKISH GORE, FAIRYTALE STUNTS AND THS MOVIE IS THE LAST BREED OF A DYING BREED OF GREAT HORROR FLICKS LIKE WE USE TO ENJOY, ORDER BOTH HERE ,GRAB POPCORN AND SNACKS, SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE THRILL!!"
5,Creepy Vision from Director Stan Winston,Horror can be defined in many ways and by many names. Add PUMPKINHEAD to that list!Actor Lance Henriksen (one of the most underated actors in film history in my opinion) makes this film a timeless and authentic horror classic. Right up there with The Evil Dead only nobody will be laughing.Watch what you do or PUMPKINHEAD will be looking for you.
5,Grossly underrated horror flick,"Before I saw Pumpkinhead for the first time, I thought it would be just another blood-laden trainwreck of a movie. But after I watched it, I realized that it wasn't just about some creature going around killing people, but that there was a story behind the demon, and a moving one at that."
1,Quite awful,"My expectations weren't even that high when I watched this horror film entitled Pumpkinhead. I was at the very least expecting some decent scares and overall a somewhat entertaining movie. Instead, Pumpkinhead is a fairly limp addition in the genre. What does it have going for it? Well, Lance Henriksen delivers a decent performance and the Pumpkinhead design is good. However, what the movie has going against it is bad acting from the actors who played the teenagers, a very fake looking setting (it really should have set the tone but it doesn't), and a just plain unscary center. This film was Stan Winston's directorial debut. Strange, I always thought he'd try to do a big budget extravaganza rather than a low budget creature feature."
1,bad,this movie was just bad dont buy it. the movie did not keep my attention i fell asleep during the first watching and tried again and failed every time i tried to watch it i gave it as a gift after i realized it was bad and they hated it too.
5,nice surprise,"Years ago, I went to the local VHS rental store specifically to find a good monster movie. I grabbed this off the rack because it had a cool cover - knowing nothing other than what I read on the box. Never heard of Lance Henriksen, and had not a clue who Stan Winston was. A couple of hours later this movie went damn near to the top of my 'finest-movies-ever-made' list. It has it all, a great story, based on old hillbilly folklore, it's got atmosphere, swamps, revenge, a witch, and one of the coolest, mischievous creatures ever conjured up. For a killer, it's intelligent, with a subtle heart, and a wry sense of humor. There's some blood, but it's needed to tell the story, it's not gushed up to quench the masses. Splatterfest? Definitely not. Good ol' fashioned story-telling with a touch of class? Right on the money."
1,A lame Movie,"This movie is basically a soap opera trying to pass for a horror flick. Plots are very bland, nothing unique about it, and the monster are a borrowed alien movie costume. Very dull to watch."
3,Incorrect cover art,"First let me say that the movie itself is very creepy and worth watching if you are into backwoods horror. My 3 star rating is not for the movie but for the misleading DVD cover art on the Amazon website. This new cover art was not what I recieved. I was sent the old cover art with Lance Henrikson, the star, on the cover with a small shot of Pumpkinhead in the background. Very disappointing since I already owned that copy. The new photo makes one believe that it is a new edition with possible extras not on the previous copy. It would have been nice to get the actual cover art that appears above. Beware."
3,Loved it.,"This is the kind of frieghtfest movie I'd been waiting to see for a long while. Didn't think it was going to be any good, because of the name, but I was so wrong! This was amazing! It was scary, violent, and gory. This is what horror is all about. Jason needs to go up against pumpkinhead. The idea isn't original, but it still manages to pull off what it set out to do. A group of teenagers camping in a remote mountain resort accidentally kill a boy and cover it up, and his aggrieved father (Lance Henriksen) vows revenge. Enlisting the help of a local witch, he conjures up a mythic demonic monster to kill those responsible for his son's death. It's scary, funny, and gory. A must see with the lights off movie."
5,Great Fun,This puzzle is of extremely good quality and has been enjoyed tremendously by my kids ranging in age from 3-8.
3,Puzzle Problems,"I've purchased several Melissa & Doug products and have be really pleased with the quality. However, with this particular puzzle numerous pieces had the picture peeling away from the cardboard backing. Not the quality I was expecting."
5,Great puzzle,"Wonderful puzzle. Bought it for my 4 yr old, and he loves it. Just challenging enough for him to do."
5,Best product - Once again!,"Doug & Melissa puzzles are the best! My son loves it, I love it. I have purchased a few of these in the past couple of years and they all are very well made, strong pieces, easy to put together, very colorful. My 5 year old loves them. This 100 piece puzzle is just amazing. Kudos to the makes. Great product guys. Buy them if you are looking for one. Will NOT go wrong."
2,Misleading,"I recommended the Amici milk bottles to my friend. She had seen mine and loved them. When her order arrived the bottles were green. I do see green in the description for the Global Amici versus the Amici. it is possible she ordered these by mistake, but why show a clear glass bottle and not a green one."
5,The Top 40 - Make That 32,"Growing up, I was a big fan of listening to the top 40 songs that were played on the radio. They were the best songs of the year. This wonderful book excites me in a similar way. These are the top 32 articles on Buddhism for 2005. They will stand the test of time. They will be just as relevant many years from now. Melvin Mcleod (editor) does a great job weaving these stories together. They are eye opening and instructive and people will resonate to these stories to whatever extent their readiness allows them to benefit from them. It is not a self-help book but it can indeed be helpful. It is not necessary to be steeped in Buddhism to enjoy this book, but if you are, you will not be disappointed."
4,This is amazing and so much fun.,"On the box it says it's for ages 8 years and up, well I can tell you it's fun for a Granny also. Some hand held games are boring after a while, not this one! You can read the questions to your partner and two can play along. That way both will be surprised when the item is named. I love it."
1,20 Questions,"It's hard to rate a product that never worked. I want to give it zero stars. I bought it new and sent it to someone in San Francisco for Christmas and it wouldn't work. How embarassing for me and disappointing for the recipient. Don't think I want to order anything electronic from Amazon. HG in Baltimore, MD"
5,Great show!,"This show was great, I never heard of it before I saw it on Amazon. I watched both seasons in about a week, now I miss the characters."
5,Diamond in the rough,"This is a great show that I stumbled upon. It's very clever, lighthearted, and creative. I wish there was a third season!"
5,Come on ABC!,"You cancelled one of the funniest (and best cast) shows ever. At least give us the second season dvd set to watch and re-watch and enjoy, and lament that you and the general viewing public didn't appreciate what a truly clever show it was."
5,"Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish Immigrants, 1820-1920 (Coming","This book is a MUST read for all people of Norwegian, Swedish, or Danish heritage. Just like Grandma told me!!"
3,Descriptive book,"It was a good story line. If you like books that are very descriptive and allow you to ""see"" the images, then you'd like that aspect of it. As a matter of fact, I'd say that most of the text is descriptions of the environment of the Amazon. I will say, that there wasn't much of an ending. I liked it up until the very last paragraph. After that I regretted spending the time to read it. Also, the event that we await at the end of the journey was never even written about. It's as if the story was cut off before the ending. It's like watching a movie and the electricity going off near the end. This wasn't my favorite Verne book, but he's still my favorite writer."
3,good,"All the reviews said this is too hard, I disagree! This is too soft!! Mine is way to flimsy.Foam rollers are supposed to be firm, so that when you push it with your thumb it shouldn't give or be pushed inward."
3,"foam roller, that's what it is.","I bought this as a potential replacement for having to roll a towel which I was taught by PT to do and lay on it to support my spine, and stretch part of the back. The towel alone works great, just annoying because flattens out and have to keep re-rolling, so I thought the foam roller would be a good substitute. Well, not quite, it is exactly as advertised so not the product's fault....but it is WIDE, much wider than a rolled towel, and it is HARD, so seems uncomfortable...at least for the purpose I bought it for. I will be reviewing other advice for how to use this product now that i have, it, but just wasn't what I was expecting."
2,Over-priced and disappointing selection of songs,"As a long-time fan of the Free Design, I was looking forward to this CD, even though the price was steep... I was so disappointed that I am putting it up for sale. While the arrangements are the usually excellent Free Design, the choice of songs are very religious in orientation (6 out of 12). Also, the number of selections is only 12. I expect more for that amount of money. The packaging is Japanese, so the information on the songs is slight."
3,okay,"this cd is good if a bit too raucous for me (and I listen to bands like NIN Marilyn Manson and Korn) this is my first cd that I've heard by them and I definetely like some of it and will listen to it again as background noise but unfortunately that's all it can be. With no real ""hooks"" to ground you somewhere in the music you can sometimes get lost in the seemingly endless chaos of their selections. I've been wanting to hear these guys since I heard they covered smells like teen spirit, of course that tracks isn't on here but this disc makes me want to pursue their previous work and see what else they can do."
2,Give or take it or leave it,"Apparently this is what Columbia Records calls ""jazz"" in the post-Marsalis era. These three guys play ""acoustic"" instruments (piano, bass and drums) but they are more inspired by Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Liberace, and Iron Maiden than they are by, say, the Bill Evans Trio or Keith Jarrett. They are bombastic, melodramatic, overblown and sometimes entertaining in a theatrical sort of way. It's very difficult to take them seriously as jazz artists, which is where you will find this in your neighborhood record store if you even have one anymore, or go to one. I guess I'd put it in the Classical section, under ""Percussion"". Approach with caution, and be on the lookout for flying shrapnel."
2,"Why does this ""Bad Plus"" c.d. sound compressed, flat and uninvolving?","I do kinow how why, I can only speculate, but the quality of the recording is sub par. The music is great, the recording is horrible. It sounds compressed, flat and uninvolving."
5,Call It....Thug Jazz!,"These cats are incredible! After the little heard ""Motel"" and last year's stunning major label debut ""These Are The Vistas"", the Bad Plus return with an even more abstract, left of center LP that's better than anyone had a right to expect. Track umber 4, ""And Here We Test Our Powers Of Observation"" is my current fave on this disc, though thier cover of The Pixies' ""Velouria"" is a close second. This band attacks it music with such fury and energy, the entire experience is like an aural beatdown! This is where rock and jazz collide and create a whirling halestrom that will undoubtably alter the course of modern music. Everybody get on board!"
2,Too Much Banging,"A while back I waxed enthusiastic over the Bad Plus's debut Columbia CD, These Are the Vistas; about this one, my enthusiasm is subdued. The aggressive attitude manifest in that earlier recording seems to have become a caricature of itself in this recording. There just seems to be just too much banging going on this time, and the bass-heavy tonal balance does not help. I seem to recall a 70s rock album titled ""What Once Were Vices Now Are Habits"" (I think it was by the Doobie Brothers), a title that would be appropriate for this release--but maybe in reverse: ""What Once Were Habits Now Are Vices.""In any event, I hope this recording is simply a sophomore slump, and that in their next outing, the Bad Plus will overcome some of their bad habits. If they (and we) are really lucky, they will also find an engineer who is less intent on hitting the listener over the head or kicking him or her in the gut."
4,"not bad, but not as good as","this is a good album, dont get me wrong, but there are a few ""filler"" tracks on here in my opinion. i liked pretty much every song on their last album, ""these are the vistas"" but i cant say that about this album. cheney pinata, while the name is funny, is a crappy song in my opinion. 2 out of every 3rd song on here is a keeper, but with the high expectations i had for this cd, due to their last album, i was let down."
3,"""Out there"" for the mainstream","I don't know, this album keeps coming up over the place with rave reviews. I didn't even have to buy it, because a friend sent me a copy. So people like it, that's fine. It's not a bad album, but it has zero rotation in my playlist because there's so much else out there. The playing seemed a little wooden to me. It's really not all that adventurous, and jazz has been moving in plenty of directions post-bebop if you explore just a little. Try Ted Sirota's Rebel Souls ""Breeding Resistance"" or Eight Bold Souls ""Last Option"". Mingus' ""Ah Um"" is a classic. Those are just a few suggestions. Find what you like. As for this album, I'll probably hand my copy off to someone who isn't a serious jazz fan as an intro (Usually I use Coltrane's ""My Favorite Things"", which was my intro, or ""Take 5"" or ""Kind of Blue""). For someone who listens to a lot of jazz, you don't need my recommendation anyway, you can listen to the samples or wait for a friend to send you a copy."
1,impulse buy,"This CD was featured in the jazz section at Borders and Barnes& Noble. It initially seemed interesting -but by the seventh song it began to sound overplayed , restless , monochromatic and somehow heartless or joyless- (I resold it to a used book store almost immediately)"
4,nicely done,"I agree with the others that this is perhaps the best written book in the series so far. We get to see very intimately how Kindred interact with mortals. Hesha, the Setite that the story revolves around, is constantly referred to as a ""monster"" and yet acts so very gentlemanly... we find out in the end what he truly is, just as Liz, our hero, finds out.This story does in fact stand alone but it does tie into the larger story, adding some rather frightening details that seem to be almost glossed over. Keep your eyes open."
3,best so far,I have read all the calan novels so far. I agree with the GA. reader that this is the best so far. But I have to say that I am disapointed with the series up to date. I am hoping for a better future though:). I will warn non White Wolf readers not to get any of these novels(or maybe I should say chapters) because you will not understand a thing. (sorry its late just a short thought on the book)
5,"Devious plot line, it will fascinate and hold your attention","Seriously, I believe this series gets better and better. This book is marvelous compared to the previous ones. Tzimicie perhaps was the best I read so far but Setite won over it. I believe the story is probably a theme that explains the background of the eye, somewhat."
4,Not all that bad a book.,"Clan Novel: Setite has been the only book that I've read of the Clan Novel series, and I must say that, all in all, it wasn't all that terrible a book. It wasn't an outstanding piece of literature, and as far as both quality and quantity, it had its share of weak spots. I doubt that a reader uninitiated to White Wolf would like it very much, and only if you're one of the fans of the World of Darkness will you feel the need to read this book. And it won't compel you to turn the pages rapidly; it didn't for me. Still, it satisfied my taste for the Vampire: the Masquerade storyline, and although it didn't tempt me to read any other of Ryan's books, it did an excellent job as far as catering to a White Wolf fan."
4,Read A Splendid Country,"A Splendid Country by T. Austin Cumings is a historic novel that extends from 1776 to 1875. It gives excellent descriptions of America life and times: river life, town life, farming life, war times, politics, frontier life and even weather events. The author weaves historical characters in and out of his plots in a very engaging way. I found myself caring about this family as they journeyed from the Shenandoah Valley to Texas. Read this book, it is a delightful way to learn about history."
5,No fit - Nissan Sentra - MR20DE,"I cannot speak to the quality of this Stant part.2008 Nissan Sentra - MR20DE Thermostat (ie. water inlet)While Amazon says this part fits my car, it does not. It is too deep to seat in the thermostat housing."
4,"Interesting, light read",I was interested in the book after seeing the movie. I found the book an interesting light read. I would recommend it to others.
3,The Big Year,Interesting how people will spend money and time to chase birds. Would have like to have seen some illustrations of hard to find birds.
4,This one for the Bird(ers),Anyone interested in birding should enjoy this book. The humor is subtle; the facts about birds spot-on. Definitely a keeper on my rapidly-dwindling book shelf space. (Amazon has been a wonderful source of supply!)
5,Great book,I believe non- birders would like this book almost as much as those of us who chase birds. It's exciting and quite humorous too. The author will be speaking at our Birding festival in a couple of months and I can't wait to meet him!
5,Delightful book on obsessive birders,"This is a delightful account of three dedicated birders doing a Big Year: trying to see as many species as possible in a 365-day span. The author captures their enthusiam, humor, insight into birder culture, and knowledge. Loved every word of it and looking forward to seeing the video. Highly recommended, especially for birders."
5,Much better than the movie!,"Would you believe that I've read this book twice? For avid birders, this book reads like a comedic Ludlum novel...fast-paced, exotic locations, twists and turns at every chapter. Unfortunately, the movie failed to deliver, but do yourself a favor...pick it up and vicariously get lost in the excitement of A Big Year. I just loved it!"
4,"Unusual, funny, captivating","Every page put an exclamation point in my head, a smile on my lips, or a field guide into my hands."
2,Reads like one long newspaper article,"I was surprised how the author could write such a boring book about such an exciting event. The writing is very choppy, 2 of the 3 characters come off as overindulgent, pompous and greedy and there's very little description of the wonderful places and birds the competitors encounter.If you really want to get a good feel for birding or a Big Year, read Ken Kauffmann's ""Kingbird Highway"".This book is really a disservice to birders."
3,I saw the movie,"I didn't read the book, I saw the movie. I honestly thought it would be about Kenn Kaufman's book, Kingbird Highway. I explained to my wife after the movie, which was entertaining, that the producers of the movie had taken a lot of liberties with the story - they actually started off the movie with the disclaimer ""This is a true story, except for the facts."" Ken didn't have a cell phone, he mostly hitchhiked around the country and stayed with birding friends, and worked odd jobs to finance his year. The photography in the movie was worth the price, but if you want to read a real Big Year book, get Kingbird Highway."
4,Monty Python is the greatest comedy group of all time,"This collection is good but not great. The sketches are priceless, but Monty Python does their best stuff when they perform live and only do their most popular sketches. regardless, this is a great dvd for MP lovers"
3,Front Cover Misleading...,"I was dissapointed when my son received this DVD as it didn't have some episodes I thought it would. Why on earth would they show Emily on the front cover with Thomas (from the newer episode ""Halloween"") and not even include that episode? It didn't have Flour Power either. Even more misleading is that one of the reviews here lists those episodes as being on this DVD. Unfortunately that was one of the few reviews here when I put it on my son's Christmas list last fall.While this does have some good episodes that I am happy to own on DVD, I don't understand why they made a Halloween DVD without the newer Halloween episodes and why they made such a misleading cover (Emily isn't in a single episode on this DVD)."
3,Halloween,"Very entertaining for the younger audience, exciting but not scary. Some of the stories where rerun from other Thomas video collections, that I noticed; but overall a very fun collection for my kids."
4,Just what we wanted,Very quick delivery. Use both the intake and exhaust settings.This fan really help move the cool evening air into the house. We use the exhaust setting in the morning to remove the dog smell.
2,Almost a great fan,"The fan is good a blowing air into a room, and it does pull air out of the room when you put it on exhaust. Unfortunately they did not make the opening for the fan itself circular, like they do when they make attic fans. That would have made it 2-3 times better at pulling air out of a room. Hunter used to make great window fans, that would pull cool air into the whole house, because they had shielding for the fan so that there was a circular opening - once the air was pushed out of the house, it wouldn't circle back through the open part of the fan and get back in. This could easily have been as great of a product if they had put the right shroud around the fan."
1,Doesn't work as stated,"The fan does work fairly well as an intake fan. However, in exhaust mode (the mode I need), I can barely feel a breeze from either side of the unit. It simply doesn't work as an exhaust fan. Therefore, to accurately describe the fan it may be a 2,470 cfm intake fan and it is about a 2 cfm exhaust fan. I'm returning it. By the way, the packing slip from ""Air-n-Water"" states that a 15% restocking fee that applies to all returns. I am very unhappy with the fan and will be extremely unhappy with ""Air-n-Water"" if they try to hit me with a restocking fee."
5,Air King 9600 does the job,"The Air King 9600 cools my entire house. It reduced the need for other fans, and most importantly the air conditioner. It will pay for itself in one summer because of the reduced use of the A/C. Easy to install. I would purchase this fan again. I would definitely recommend this fan."
5,powerful way to cool down,"Fan works great on intake or exhaust. Quickly pulls air out of the house when on full power for exhaust. Great breeze from intake. Also light enough to pull out of the window when we need to. (Read other review, but have not had any problems with ours. Might have been a defective model? The working model pulls well in either direction.)"
1,Extremely poor qualtiy and poor service,"When I opened the box the first thing I noticed is the extrememly low quality plastic. One of the expandable screens was cracked at the edge - even though there was no damage to the external packaging. Then I discovered the expandable screens don't glide, they grate, and don't stay is place. And the winning discovery was that the fan doesn't operate - at all. No lights, no spinning blades, not even a hint of movement from the motor.To top it off I was charged $20 in shipping, a $15 re-stocking fee and $20 to return a defective piece of merchandise. I would absolutely recommend buying your fan from somewhere else. Support a local store that cares about your return business."
3,Needs improvement,"This baby moves the air both intake and exhaust. It is louder than anticipated (64db on high) which means you should put it at least 2 rooms from where you are. Vibrates on medium and high even when installed properly as the plastic rubs on plastic. For the price I expected somewhat higher quality. One part was damaged on delivery but did not affect operation so I let it ride. Good plug/cord placement and easy to use controls. Didn't feel it lived up to the made in USA label. Quality I would have expected from a ""make it cheaply"" Chinese import."
3,"When it works, it is a decent fan. Connections are not robust.","The fan did not work when I received it. Being reasonably handy, I took it apart and found a wire that had fallen out of its connector. The wiring block connector is really pretty flimsy. I would not be surprised if it falls apart again.Once the fan is working, it pushes a good bunch of air, and while all fans make noise it is not too much of a howl.If you can manage a screwdriver and don't mind putting 20 minutes into occasional repairs, it is a reasonably useful fan."
2,Better options out there,"Bought the entire Dream series. Crossovers and speaker terminals are cheap. Center speaker terminal was not even tight. Had to fix it myself. No biggie. Sound and look good, but you can do better for the price."
5,This should be essential reading for all Irish Americans,The book is particularly insightful on the issue of gunrunning to the IRA and the methods used by the FBI to prosecute these gunrunners. In places it is as gripping as a good detective novel!
1,When supporting terrorism was cool,"Exposes how, before September 11, a section of the American people actively supported blowing up babies and women in a constituent part of the United Kingdom. Now, with the ""War on Terror"", we (the British) are supposed to forget all that. No chance."
3,What! Cried Granny,"Not a bad story, not a great one either! My six year old son liked it, the illustrations are very bright and colourful."
5,What! Cried Granny is a hit with my second grade class.,"What! Cried Granny is a wonderfully written story that is a perfect example for reading to entertain. I have read this story to my second grade class, and they have begged me to read it over and over again. It has been a great springboard for discussing resourcefulness as Granny cuts down a tree to make a bed, wakes the chickens to collect feathers for a pillow, shaves the sheep for wool to make a blanket, and tears down her living room curtains to make a teddy bear so that young Patrick can enjoy his first sleep-over at her house. I loved the last line of dialogue in the book, but I'll leave that for you to find out on your own as you read the book. The writing and illustrations are first class. I do recommend this book to any parent or teacher."
5,Child's favorite book,My 28 month old daughter picked this book out one day at the library. She enjoyed it so much that she had it memorized within a few days. My husband and I ended up having to order her her own copy. We just got it in and we are already reading it to her over and over. My parents came over and she made them read it to her too. It is her favorite book! It is also a really cute story line.
4,Pretty funny stuff..,"After watching the first, I figured the second cant be a total letdown. And it wasnt, actually. I love Seagal..Maybe it's just the terrible acting, I dont know, I just love the guy, and he does a worthwhile job portraying the Casey character. Heigl was pretty bad, however. I'm happy they didnt make her a huge part of the movie, and ""Penn"" did a pretty poor job of living up to Tommy Lee as the insane bad guy. The Dane character was pretty good, however. And the action is constant, and actually impressive throughout the movie. The only dissapointment would be the very end, which was indeed a bit of a let down. But the movie's worth it just because it does keep you attached, and it had some nice visuals, not to mention some pretty bad ones. It's still worth it, and the DVD wasnt that bad either, set at a good price and the transfer was done fairly well. It doesnt let down on the extras, either, so what's to loose?"
1,Mind-numbingly derivative action drama. Yuk!,"What makes this movie different from all the other over-the-top action films of this genre that has preceded this? Absolutely nothing at all. All visual hyperbole and ridiculous cliched macho heroics from the strictly one-dimensional acting 'talents' of Segal. Appeals only to the brain-dead. Wake up people: you're being rinsed and bleached by those greedy Hollywood titans -- and, to think that a New Zealander was complicit in the making of this piece of asinine drivel."
3,why bother,this movie is poor as a sequal to under seige its not even on a boat what were they thinking when they made it why didnt they just call it dark territory it probably would of done better.to make a seaqual to a big blockbuster must be a risk.i mean what if someone has heard good things about the original and gets this first what are they gonna think.it has got some good scenes in so i cant give it less than 3 as a seagal fan take my advise and rent before you buy
2,Could probably have been good,"A slow movie with bad fight scenes. I heard the first was good, so i gladly bought dis' one because the first one was impossible to find in any shop here in Sweden."
1,R rating is not strong enough,"I truly enjoyed watching the movie on TV and in the theater, but on the DVD... that's a whole different story. Almost every other word that comes out of ""bad guys"" mouth is an f... word. Was this really necessary for the plot of the movie? Good thing that I bought this movie used, because after one time watching it, it's going straight in the trash. It's a great action movie with very distasteful dialogs. I wish I knew where I could get PG version of it."
4,One of Seagal's best movies,"If you're a Steven Seagal fan or like the action movies of the 80's and 90's, then this is a must to your collection. Seagal delivers his unique brand of action as he takes out a group of terrorists who have taken over a military satellite weapon. Fast paced, with great music by Basil Poledouris, Under Siege 2 was one of the last great big screen Seagal movies."
3,Above the Law,"An old favorite, action packed and enjoyable, it's nice to see Steven Seagal at his best."
1,Welcome to the Amazing Crapfest,"Ok, I didn't exactly have high expectations for this film. That being said, this movie managed to dissapoint even my extremely low expectations. I think this film has the worst dialogue of any film I've ever seen. Also, the whole plot is retarded. What kind of a moron would hijack a train? Gee, that makes sense. I think I'll hijack a slow moving object about a mile long. No way anyone could ever stop that. Its a shame because the first film was fairly enjoyable and the character Seagal played was interesting. Unfortunately they killed all of that in this crapfest. Only watch this film if you're trying to analyze how NOT to make a film."
4,The Last Blooper!,"This movie is action packed fun and good but like all movies, plenty of bloopers.I justwant to write about the last part of the movie in which the two trains collide.The whole accident was a blooper! If you playback the movie slowly, you can tell thatthe two locomotives of the passenger train's locomotive already derailed just before hitting thefreight train.This caused the freight train's first locomotive to hit the passengertrain from the side rather than ""Head on"" as it was supposed to be.This made the whole collision look different. Even though the accident looked veryrealistic and spectacular, it was not done correctly. If you know of any moviesthat have well made ""Head on"" collisions, reply me cause up till now, I haven't seen any.There is a show called ""Movie Magic"" of which gave detail about how the collision was made.I can't find anything about this show on the internet. If you know in what channelthey show it, please write!"
5,"two thumbs up, a real good time","steven seagal returns as ex navy seal casey ryback in this great sequal. the plot; bad guys take over a train to use a weapons satellite, but never thought casey ryback would be on the train. he is the only hero that stands in the way. this is an outstanding sequal to the first one which is better, but both are outstanding. rated r for strong violence and lots of language."
3,Hilarious! Funny in all of the wrong places.,"One of my all time favorite comedies. Watch as hardened mercenaries nearly crap themselves at the very mention of ""Casey Ryback's"" name. Chock full of one-liners so corny, you'll run to the kitchen for butter and salt."
3,"Ridiculous, but fun.","Unlike the first ""Under Siege"", this one is definitely for Seagal fans only. He takes out a whole trainload of bad guys without breaking a sweat. But as a fan that's why I'm watching."
4,UNDER SIEGE 2: DARK TERRITORY,"Steven Seagal is back as Casey Rayback, the Navy Seals officer turned professional cook, in this explosive sequel to the original UNDER SIEGE. This time, a group of international terrorists led by an ex-CIA operative have seized control of an express train and they are using it as there headquarters to control a top secret government satellite orbiting the Earth in space. Well, they didn't count on Casey Rayback to be on the train with his niece. Twice the action, twice the thrills, and twice the fun that was in the first film. If you liked UNDER SIEGE, you'll like UNDER SIEGE 2!"
2,STEVEN SEGAL IS THE WORST ACTOR ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH!,this movie is just bad. all sequels are dumber the the first for example look at scream it went down hill from there. its the same this with this movie the first one was decent and this one as just bad. of course thats my opinion i may be wrong
4,More of the same from Segal,"The original ""Under Seige"",starring the at times wooden Steven Segal,was set aboard a battleship as our ""hero"" sets about,overcoming hijacking terrorists against all the odds......a slick action blockbuster in the"" Die Hard""mould.This sequel basically rehashes the same plot,but changes the location from the battleship to a train where once again Segal,in the guise of ex Navy Seal,now chef,""Casey Ryback"" battles against both the odds and the terrorists.As Ryback says in the film ""No one beats me in the kitchen "" Fans of the action gerne and Steven Segal will not be dissappointed."
4,A typical Seagal action flick,"If you like Seagal action movies - I do -, then you will like this one. Lots of action, good special effects. The video transfer to DVD seems to be more than adaquate. The audio front end seemed to be good, stereo effects and subwoof stirring, but the surround seemed a bit weak."
2,JUST OKAY !,I bought this to iron on a plain white shirt for myself to wear on my wedding day. Well I followed the directions and it did not turn out so great! The stones did not all transfer on to the shirt!!! So I was not happy and did not wear it that day after all.
5,RHS steel,RHS steel Australia standard and Britain standard .Please tell me Australia standard 1163 and grade C350 steel equal to which Britain standard and grade.
2,Average Joe Book Review,"What should be a book you can't put down - this was highly disappointing. To blame is the writer's style. My goodness - if I wanted to be bored to tears, Lears is the guy to do it. Reading this book was actually laborous and I'd hate to see what one of Lears' classroom lectures must be like. The only reason I didn't give just one star was that the information itself is accurate and excellent! (The reason I bought the book to begin with) Still - there isn't much to be desired from a book that reads slower than an Anthropology textbook. Great ideas and concepts for a book - grammar is correct - NO FLAVOR in the writing at all. zzzzzzzz"
1,JT4 jet tips,"The product is cheaply made. Out of the four tips, two did not have leaks between the colored section and the clear section. The remaining two were not bent at the proper angle for easy use. The angle of the tip should be atleast a 75 degree bend."
1,Don't waste your money or fix it with crazy glue!,"I bought this 4 tips for my old waterpik model. What a waste of time and money!My old tip was broken after my son bent it.Unable to get one new tip at Wal-mart I found at the amazon web place this seller. When I received them, I tried the first one tip (The kit comes with 4 tips)... what a deception, it leaked at the junction of the clear tip with the colored round connector, and tried the other 3... same problem, a bad seal at the junction. I fixed them with some crazy glue, and at this time (3 weeks later) the fixed tip is doing its job... those are generic tips, maybe a copy from the Chinese factory copiers... but those leave a lot to desire.Since those are the only ones for replacement, it's up to you to fix them in order to use your old waterpik."
5,Great Product Super Fast shipping,"These jet tips were exactly as stated. They were hard to find as they are for the older waterpiks. Fit fine, work great.Shipping was fast and Merchant kept me informed of when it was shipped and I would definitely buy from Amazon and this merchant again."
4,homemaker,It's so nice to go to Amazon and find product that is no longer in production by the manufacture.
1,All leak and losing pressure,This has to be a product featuring the rejects. There is absolutely no quality control on this product. I purchased 2 packs and they all leak. Not usable at all. very disappointing because I like my waterpik and it still works great but now I'm down to my last original tip.
2,Nice product if it stays glued,"There were 4 replacement tips for the Teledyne Water Pik. Within 4 days of receiving the order, 3 0f 4 separated at the base-tube connection--the 4th within a week. Goodman's kindly sent me another 4-tip packet. The first one used broke in similar fashion, the one I'm using now is going on its second week without incident. With the original purchase, those tips lasted 7-8 years without problem. Must be Chinese innovation."
5,Satisfied with this product,These Piks will add more years to the life of my old style WaterPik. Thanks for offering products such as this!
3,"Cute, but won't last forever","I originally purchased these for birthday presents for my daughters friends. They are cute, but are a little more cheaply made than I expected. For the price, they are worth it, but I am definitely going to have to find something to go with them, the playset alone is not enough. I paid $4.44 for the sets with free shipping, any more than that, and I would probably pass..."
2,A Knight's Armor in Review,"This is fair representation of a knight's armor. The product is hard plastic, which I didn't like, especially the weapons. If a child fell while running, there could be a bloody mess. The helmet, breast plate lasted the longest. The weapons were taken away after some play. A little to dangerous in my opinion. It is not appropriate for younger children, and dangerous for a nonresponsible child. Buy it at your own peril. We bought the book on armor and were glad to rid ourselves of the product."
1,not worth the money,This product looks rather gray when applied and does not cover as well as one would expect given the exorbitant cost!!
5,Great,Excellent book. A must read for parents and especially young ones. Gives much to think about and think through. Great principles to live by as well.
5,"""Breaking the will""","""Disappointed"" is quite wrong. Dr. Dobson does not advocate ""breaking the spirit""; in fact, he warns against this. What he does encourage is to ""break the will"" (defiance).This is an excellent book to read if you want to raise children who are respectful and well-adjusted."
5,The Title Says It All,THere is really nothing else to say - If you don't have the guts to do it right - get a dog instead.
1,Child abuse is not Christian,"James Dobson, who wrote about proudly beating his own dog with a leather belt, gives sadistic, un-Christian advice to parents looking for help. Skip this book, practice the Golden Rule. If you think Jesus would approve of whipping little children, you need to repeat Sunday School."
1,a little too religious,"I was looking forward to reading this book. I was disappointed to discover the author's religious beliefs woven throughout the text. To my knowledge, the book was not advertised in any way as a religious take on the topic. Further, the author advocates 'breaking the spirit' of children and suggests that one way to do so is to slap their thighs as a show of who is boss.Quite a disappointment."
2,Some helpful info with alot of religion,There is some helpful information in this book if you are dealing with a very difficult child. It was too heavy on religion and bible quotes for my taste. I would have preferred more factual examples and ways to put the ideas into effect.
3,I wish I had waited.,It has been a cold winter in New York and I bought this for an outside shed area. It still sits on my back porch because I have not been able to get it to light. The directions are poor but the the trick to getting it lit is even poorer. I would never buy another one of these.
3,Keyword- Advanced,We have used Jumpstart for three years to help our child prepare for the upcoming grade. We find it necessary to sit with our child to work with Jumpstart. Recently a teacher commented about Jumpstart- that it is a program for children who are advanced for their grade level and preparing to gear up for the next grade. It is not a preparatorial tool for those on middle ground. The child's vocabulary and other school skills must be several notches above average to use this program without parental assistance. A program for above standard achievers.
1,StrugglingMom,"Honestly, we've not put much time into actually using the program but won't be either. I have an ""Advanced"" 3rd Grader and she does not like this Game. The introduction to the game is very, very long and she looses interest. There appears to be no way around the introduction into areas that are ""fun"". There is also not an ""Exit"" or ""Escape"" route to shut off the constantally talking robot. We need quicker access to the ""fun"" so that we can actually learn something, and this game doesn't do that."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"A lot of process but not enough insight. Having a procedure to address an issue is fine, but without better information about why and examples, I didn't feel I got all I needed from this book. Sadly there simply aren't too many physical security books from an IT perspective out there. So if you just want a process to follow, and that's all you need - this may be a book for you."
5,Super Artist,This is a great book about a great artist. I saw the pictures in original and they are very good reproduced in this book. Who loves photorealism should have it.
4,Good swing,I got this for my niece and her mom says that the baby really likes this swing. It's durable and easy to clean. It sleeps the baby and keeps her entertained. The plug in saves a lot of batteries!
3,Not enough recline.,"I bought this swing primarily for the electric power option as I have enough baby gadgets that require batteries. I liked the swing speeds and the music was not as irritating as most infant music devices. The seat cover seemed well padded and comfortable and overall, the swing did not take up too much room. The power option was wonderful and I think it should be included on the majority of swings! But I ultimately returned this swing as the lowest recline was just not enough to make my baby comfortable. She always cried when I put her in it. And her head would always fall to the side if she happened to fall asleep. There is not much difference between the highest recline and the lowest. If you would like your baby to nap comfortably in his/her swing, I don't recommend this one."
2,Watch what you buy!,"I bought this swing thinking that it would be great. It wasn't! If you baby like to move at a faster speed than do NOT buy this item! The swing is great and so is the mobile but the battery powered swing does a much better job as far as speed and swinging go. Just me but I will watch what I buy next time because to me this is not worth paying the ""new"" price, better to get it ""used"". Thanks."
5,Great deal,"This thing is definitely worth the money if you have the money to buy a swing. Because it is powered by electric instead of batteries, you save a ton of money. We actually had to throw out our previous swing prematurely because the place where the batteries go, went corroded and we couldn't use it anymore. Unless you get a deal for a different swing with the price being far less, go for this one."
3,I LOVE IT BUT BABY HATE IT,"IBOUGHT THIS FOR THE FACT THAT IT CAN PLUG INTO THE WALL THE IDEA OF NO BATTERIES SEEM GREAT. BUT MY 4 MONTH OLD GOES IN AND AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES HE CRYS, tHE MOBILE IS TOO HIGH FOR HIM TO SEE AND THE COLORS DONT KEEP HIM INTERESTED. HE CAN PLAY ON THE FLOOR FOR HOURS WITH THE INFANTINO BABY GYM WHICH ONLY COST 30$. THE CONCEPT OF THE SWING IS A NICE IDEA BUT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT WITH COLORS AND MOBILE PLACEMENT.ITS FAIRLY EASY TO MOUNT UP"
4,Good Swing,"Plug-in option is wonderful! It's a very quiet swing. The swing speeds are good. I did think the music volume was a little loud for my newborn so I put a piece of tape over it. The mobile above is not good because it doesn't come down far enough for baby to see. Also, the seat itself is pretty hard. It doesn't have much padding.Overall, it's a good swing. It just needs a few improvements."
1,"Nice Sheets but they were cut, in the package","After giving this to my 7 year old, who loved the sheets, matching comfortor, we noticed a clean cut rip ( slice ) in the top sheet while getting into bed, right smack in the middle ! It is about 5 inches long, almost looks like it was from a box cutter, but no signs of the plastic packaging beeing cut ??? The set is really boyish - very nice except the rip. I do not like to pay for something new that is damaged, unfortunately we already disposed of the packaging, so returning them is not an option at this time."
2,Too out of date to be of use.,"This book was written in 2001 (as were most of the positive reviews for it here on Amazon.) It only covers up to Platform Builder and WinCE 3.0, which are now up to version 5. As a result, the how-to parts, as well as the references, are mostly useless. In fact, I'm not sure any of the sections are relevant or can be trusted since WinCE has changed so much.Considering the price of the book, I feel cheated. The authors need to write a new version and THIS version should be pulled from circulation."
1,Overpriced for out of date information,Book is out of date and is exteremly overpriced. Anyone who attends a DevConference receives more information that is upto date than what was covered in the entire book. Waste of time and money.
2,You never actually SPELL your words!,"I bought this software hoping to work on our weekly spelling lists. First, in order to input your list of words you have to ALSO input 3 ""incorrect"" spellings for each of the words, a major pain.Second, of the 3 games, none of them include ever SPELLING your words! All i want is for my kids to practice spelling their words, obviously too much to ask for a spelling program by jumpstart. I can't believe how disappointing this program is."
2,a real disappointment,"i ordered this program for the ability to enter my daughters weekly spelling words. I thought it would help her review and practice for her exams. this feature of the program is very complicated. you can't just enter spelling lists, like i thought. my daughter says she only likes the seahorse race game."
2,Spelling Bee study aid is disappointing.,"This product is good in that it allows users to enter their own spelling words. It is disappointing because the study games do not require a user to spell the words only to recognize them among incorrectly spelled words or to add a missing letter. If the program does not already contain the words you intend to add you will need the hardware to add the correct pronunciation. Personally, I'd like a more stripped down spelling study aid that would drill words from custom lists."
1,:0(,I'm not smiling after purchasing this product. I love JumpStart's grade level products and have them all from toddler to 3rd grade! I'm afraid the method of teaching spelling on JumpStart Spelling Bee is poor and so where the results after trying it with my daugther. Her scores showed no improvement what-so-ever!
1,This was so boring.,"My 8 year old son loves Jumpstart and we were excited to be able to put our own words into the game. However, the games in this CD Rom were so boring, we could not play them. It would be more exciting to count pores on your skin."
1,It will hurt your kids eyes!,Do not buy this product. It will damage your son or daughter's eyes. The image are jiggling. Even me cannot stand them. My daughter also found it is not fund to play with it. So do not waste your money.
5,A great math refresher course,I found myself floundering while trying to help with Algebra ll homework. It's a great reference for all the little things you've forgotten or maybe never known. Well organized and easy to navigate.
2,Nice features but several problems,"In many ways I really like this all in one, it's does great copying, printing, scanning in all ways except that it often prints slightly crooked on the paper, off by a small but noticeable amount. HP tried over the phone to help me resolve this with no success. Since I have other printers, I learned to live with this until the machine died recently. HP sent me a refurbished replacement which after about a year of ownership I was happy to do, they charged $34 for a temporary warranty ""uplifting"", no problem with that. However, I am sorry to report that this refurbished version has the same page misalignment problem as the last one. Yes, I've checked my power supply, use HP paper and toner, etc. This is just an unfortunate and non-trivial defect for this otherwise fine printer."
1,"It's great ""home"" photocopy machine","Ever since I bought this so called all in one I started having nothing but problems. Lousy software that has patches on top of patches, on top of fixes that do not fix a thing.Buy it if you are looking for a copy machine, but if you are looking for a printer or a scanner then you should be looking somewhere else.Don't make the same mistake I did...you are going to regret it."
2,Won't work with Windows 7,"This is a great MFP for Windows XP, but HP stopped supporting this device after that. After a recent upgrade to Windows 7, I have lost all the functionality besides printing. Scanning won't work and new drivers for Windows 7 have not been made available by HP. I recommend getting a different product."
4,Works great for me.,"I have had this machine about 4 years and it works great for us. We use in our home office and use all functions, print, scan, fax. I have 32 bit and 64 bit computers and they both work great with the 3030. My only complaint would be the high ink price around $65.00 per cartiridge but I just ordered a off brand 3 pack for $30.00 and hope I get the same print quality. I love the scan function and use Adobe to create and save documents in color at 600 dpi. Easy to work with."
3,Kranked 7 The Cackle Factor,"This video is ok... the quality is excellent but, the footage is just really not that good....my suggestion is to purchase any video by the collective...you won't be dissapointed"
5,a great read,"Stacey describes the changes in and the politics of ""the family"" in ways that are unsurpassed for their insight and clarity. The fact that this work comes from a particular political orientation is not something she tries to hide, and she persuasively argues, here and elsewhere, that the claim to pure objectivity in family-related research is dangerous. At the same time, she is remarkably balanced, recognizing that orientations toward the family do not neatly line up along the lines of political parties, religious affiliations, or social classes."
3,In the Name of Family,"I had to get this book for a sociology class I am currently in about families. Seems to offer interesting perspectives from years past about the family structure.We are still reading it, so I have not finished it yet!"
4,We had 10 years constant 24/7 use from this model,"We got one of these as a gift in 1998. To make floor cleaning easier, we bolted it to a finished wooden base. Only at the begining of this year did it start to weep the oil out and not maintain the same heat so we bought another and used the same base. Very good value for money and there is nothing quite like a warm fluffy towel waiting for you after a bath or shower!"
3,there are better Lehane books,This was recommended to me and I was excited to read it. The intertwining stories were interesting; i learned a lot about early Boston and even about Babe Ruth. But I expected to be drawn in the way I was with his other books and I really wasn't.
2,Like his mysteries much more,Way too long and transitions are not very smooth. Did not keep my interest and I have read many of his mysteries.
2,The Given Day,"Ordered in error on Kindle. I read a few pages and deleted it immediately.. My bad- I made the mistake in ordering and although a sports fan---usually do not read books on sports. Roy ""Uper"""
5,An instant classic. . .,"The Given Day by Dennis Lehane is one of my all-time favorite books. Lehane creates some of the best characters and plot-lines that I have ever read, period. Lehane incorporates many interesting historical topics throughout. . .such as civil rights, WWI, unionism, communism, as well as many others. Not only is this book historically educational, it is extremely entertaining as well. 700+ pages seems short for this masterpiece work of fiction. I hope Dennis Lehane receives all the awards and recognition that he deserves for this book. I will be recommending it to everyone that I can."
5,Brilliant,"I loved this book -- the history, the detail, the characters, the emotion. And what an incredible setting. I've never been to Boston, but after reading several of Mr. Lehane's novels, I think it's a city I'll have to visit sometime soon. The writing had such energy, such beauty. Highly recommended."
5,NOT LET DOWN,"LIKE LEHANE'S OTHER NOVELS, THIS WAS NOT A DISSAPOINTMENT. COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN- WELL WRITTEN, FELT I WAS ONE OF THE CHARACTERS A FEW TIMES-GO SOX- THANKS FOR A GREAT READ ONCE AGAIN!KATE GENOVESEAUTHOR OF ""TWO WEEKS SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION""[...]"
1,I'm Shocked by all the 4 Stars,"This book was put together in a hurry. Most likely to sell the rights for the next movie. It was a real disappointment. I love historical fiction and I'd only heard good things about the author. He had the makings of a really good historical novel. The richness of what was going on in Boston or anywhere else in 1918 was certainly enough to create that novel. Throughout my reading I kept thinking where was his editor? It should have been neatly interwoven, but it was not. I've read Young Adult historical ficition that was much better written that this. I'm not kidding and I've read thousands. I cannot get over the fact that no one has said that already. After reading 600+ pages, I asked myself, do I really care how this ends? Well, I kept going and it was hokey. It will make a good movie, but don't read the book. It's a waste your time. Try reading one of the nonfiction books on the subjects he covers."
1,Never finished reading,Just could not get into this book-did not like it at all. Found it very confusing and boring but sad at the same time.
2,The Given Day,This book is the ultimate politically correct read. It's a good story as long as you don't mind being lectured by an obviously left-of-center novelist. If I'd know what a diatribe this was going to be I'd never bought the thing.
2,More Like the Given Decade,"I love Dennis Lehane's books, and this one is one of the two (Mystic River being the other one) that are probably the best written, but it is my least favorite. I liked the main character, and the ending was very satisfying, but I got extremely tired of reading about all the union situation and the riots. Too, too long."
2,Copping out....,"This book was a watershed for me. Lehane is an icon, whose works have been SO stand-out, with his earlier works absolutely brilliant, especially Shutter Island (in my opinion his Kafka-esque masterpiece). Now this.... It can only be called a cop-out, an escape from the widespread criticism Shutter Island received (from doltheads); what he's done here, in this evocation of early 20th-c. Boston, is sort of an evasive action, it seems to me. Much as I've loved every one of Lehane's earlier works, this one was beyond me -- uninteresting period and place, and very uninteresting characters (with the possible exception of an imagined Babe Ruth in the first chapter). Hard as I tried, I had to give up on page 169. This kind of historical thing from someone like Lehane is like Hemingway doing a Barbara Cartland.................... Please, Dennis, no more."
3,Slow start,Took a while to get into it. Not very exciting compared to some of his others. Not sure 'I will finish
5,The making of Americans: Boston blue,"This is the first installment in the saga of the Coughlin, an Irish family who makes its mark in Boston in the first half of the 20th century. The Given Day is the story of the eldest son, a policeman on his father's tracks, Danny, while Live by Night tells what happens to the youngest, Joe. There is a beautiful complexity to the novel, due to its firm anchorage in history. Babe Ruth and baseball have a part in the book. The main action is political, but all the other components, the love story, between Nora, a new immigrant and Danny, as well as the friendship between Danny and Luther Lawrence, a black baseball player illuminate the period."
3,"not bad, not a compelling read either",not his best work. A little too involved and some historical inaccuracies. His descriptive prose is precious. I had a few problems with the parallel plot lines.
5,A Great Book,"Although it doesn't quite measure up to ""Mystic River,"" it's an easy 5 stars and one of the best books I've read in years -- a true epic. I thought the Babe Ruth angle was particularly effective and the chapters about the Boston police strike were fascinating and exciting. The only drawback in my mind -- and it is minor -- is the ending. There were too many convenient coincidences and an overdose of melodrama."
3,"SORRY, IT WAS TOO LLOONNGG FOR ME","700+ pages, read like 1,000. Wow!! What an ordeal.This was the second book in a row, for me, that touchedon the ""SPANISH FLU"". I found that part of the book veryinteresting. The rest?? Some good, , ,some not so good, , ,some down-right boredom city! ! It was just to long."
3,The Best Laid Plans,"Okay, I think Lehane was trying to do the right thing in this novel: bring to life the social, economic, and political history from a previous era. The problem is, he tried to bring EVERYTHING into this book, from racism to police strikes to Babe Ruth. And anything else you can think of from the early 1900s: you'll probably find it in this book. I admire the ambition and I admire the attempt to show us a part of our history. We need to be shown, because we're pretty much an ahistoric nation: if it isn't happening on some screen somewhere, it's not worth knowing or remembering. But in this case I found the results not that interesting. I found myself skimming large parts of the book. And I didn't think the Babe Ruth sections worked that well: Ruth seemed singled out and separated from the rest of baseball in some strange way. I'm a big fan of Lehane's early novels, which work well."
3,Trying times in Boston,"This excellent novel brings the reader back to Boston in the early 1900's. The era is seen through the eyes of various characters, some fictional and some not (Babe Ruth). The novel describes the events of the time; the flu epidemic, the prolifertation of communist and socialist ideologies, the rise of trade unions, police corruption, and racial disrimination. While the list of characters is long and sometimes difficult to follow (especially if you put the book down for a couple of days), there are three main characters that dominate each of the chapters: Danny Coghlin - a Boston police officer, Luther - an African American with a troubled past, and the Babe himself. As the novel progesses, the characters lives intersect. Friendships, family relationships and a steamy romance help to keep the book interesting. A very good read."
5,exceptional,"I've read, and thoroughly enjoyed, everything Dennis Lehane has written. This book was his best yet. Not sure I understand the negative reviews. I found the story really cohesive and literally couldn't put it down. An amazing talent! I'm waiting for your next one, Dennis!"
4,The Heavy Given Day,"This is a very well-written book. At times, I thought the history really overwhelmed the story and so much of it was dreary. Even legitimate dreariness can make the words drag. That said, I really found that the quality writing, the history lesson and the story combined to make this an engaging, entertaining and informative read that delivered a bright and hopeful conclusion."
3,Routine,"Book started out with potential - interesting characters but the storyline becomes very predictable and ordinary. The behaviour of the real historical figures seems unreal as they relate to the fictional characters. Authors often need to postulate motives behind the actions of the real people, but in this case the real figures appear to be weak, minor players in the history. I don't want to reveal any of the details of the ending but it was very easy to predict and not very satifying."
4,Very good read,"I very much enjoyed this book except the ending kinda left things hanging and unresolved. That seems to me was done only so there could be a sequel. I mean, the Greenwood massacre in Tulsa was in 1921 so it can hardly be coincidental that Luther and Lila are back there again at the end of the book as 1920 dawns.Lehane is very good I think in bringing out the human-ness of characters, flaws and good points, and the main characters were folks you turn the page for, to see what happens to them next. I was not as bothered by the Babe being there throughout, in many ways his struggles were a big part of what was going on in 1918-1919 Boston, and between workers and owners of the time. I'm glad he was part of this book."
5,Great Book,"Book arrived on time and in excellent shape, great price. The author is one of my favorits so you can't asked for more. That's the bottom line up front."
5,Great Read,"I finished reading The Given Day last night and am still thinking about it this morning. This is by far my favorite Lehane book to date, and I have read them all except Live By Night which is next on my to do list. Luther and Danny are characters that will stick with me for a while, especially Danny."
3,a schizophrenic approach,"Dennis Lehane never resolves the question of whether he is writing a historic novel, or a novel set during an important historic event. When he needs to set the background for the story, his characters, their actions and language, become very stilted and unnatural; they become props to advance the historical narrative and never provide the depth of character development, nor the intense passion of their interactions, which was such a hallmark of his previous books. Only in a few instances did Lehane focus on this aspect: some scenes between Danny and Nora, some confrontations between Thomas Coughlin and his sons - that teased the reader into thinking that there would be more depth to the book, but alas, such was not the case.Perhaps the most unexpected surprise in the book, was the extraordinary description of Babe Ruth and baseball - some of the most memorable sports writing I can remember."
5,Destined to be a Classic!,"No need to do a review here; others have said it all. This is my first Lehane novel but it won't be my last. The way Lehane describes events stretches your imagination, takes you back in time like you are having a first-hand experience in turn-of-the century Boston. This masterpiece is destined to be a classic. I tried to recall a book that moved me as much as this one; it rivals such accomplishments as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and other great literature. Over seven hundred pages and I didn't want it to end. I was mesmorized by Lehane's writing."
2,Overblown Given Day,"The first Dennis Lehane book I have disliked. Extremely overwrought, unbelievable characters, a lot of stereotypes. A fascinating time in Boston history that deserves a better treatment. Too many story lines and too many coincidences of characters meeting historical figures (Babe Ruth, Dubois, etc.) create a level of implausibility in this novel. Perhaps the author would have been better served if he had scaled back and concentrated on certain aspects of that time, but influenza, WWI, baseball, molasses, police corruption, political anarchy, unionization all get the short shrift when spread out in one novel."
2,"Initially strong, intriguing effort... spoiled by weak, vapid ending","I picked this up as I was interested in the circa-WWI time period in US. The unfolding story drew me in and held my intense interest... until the weak and unsatisfying ending.The author seems to have done his homework quite well in exhaustively researching the time period and developing characters and plots accordingly. But when considering the book's length (~700 pages), it seemed the author was perhaps rushed to end the book by tying up loose ends/characters in short, weak, and ultimately unsatisfying scenes that left me feeling shortchanged.To me, the best part of the book was the opening vignette ""Babe Ruth in Ohio"". This piece, which can be read as a stand-alone short story, was worth the price of admission. However, I felt the ending revealed a work not overall worthy of the time needed to read it."
3,The given day,"Love reading Dennis Lehane, but found this book hard work. Clearly, a hell of a lot of research but too many themes, it was like swimming through custard.And if you have zero connection with Boston history, it's zero interest."
4,Epic Proportions,"Boston, 1918, Babe Ruth, slimy police, racism, the flu epidemic, all in one giant economy package. My 93 year-old father loved it as much as I did. Neither of us could put it down."
4,Boston has its own ghosts to overcome,"While not a fan of historical fiction, I am a fan of Lehane. This book may change my perspective. The question I asked continually during the read was how we can, as a society, forget what evils we wrought and felt righteous as the condemned took the bullet. Lehane has written a work of fiction based on fact that shocks and entertains. The characters are well thought out and light up the pages like good malt whiskey. A good read for a long trip because it will keep bringing you back to its pages.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
3,competent historical fiction yet rather disappointing...,"Dennis Lehane is one of my favorite writers. Some of his works, like 'Shutter Island', are modern masterpieces. So without hesitation of purchased 'The Given Day' with hope that it paralleled his better works. Sad to say, I was quite disappointed. 'The Given Day' is nothing more than a competent historical drama centered around the actions of striking Boston police officers in 1919. Yes, the characterizations are fine. Yes, the author obviously did research the subject well. But is there the wonderful dialogue Lehane is noted for? Nope. Anything particularly clever or memorable? Er..., hope. Am I glad I read all 700 pages? Hmmm... I'll give that a quiet ""yes"".Bottom Line: decent historical fiction is a step down for Lehane. Fans will be disappointed."
2,It just doesn't hang together.,"If you look at any scene individually in this book, each and every one would be a masterpiece. The style is brilliant, the period history informed and fascinating, the plot gripping.The problem is that each and every scene jangles separately like a set of keys. A bright set of keys yes it is, but each seems to open a separate door.The problem is that the characterization is a bit cliched, and therefore one never gets quite a handle on the whole book. I felt after reading it that I hadn't even quite read a whole book. Mr. Lehane (whose other books I liked better)apparently felt that the history of the times would be enough to hold ""A Given Day"" together.But the history, as fascinating as it is, could not substitute for characters that one could really dig into."
2,A Dud,"I agree with just about everything the two and three star reviewers are saying about this book. And since the author couldn't trim this book down, I'll keep my review short and sweet. This book downright stunk, was way overwritten and had too many unbelieveable characters.That being said, Dennis Lehane is one of my favorite authors, I've read every one of his novels, felt that ""Mystic River"" was a masterpiece, but he fell down a little bit with ""Shutter Island"", but hey everyone has a slip up once in a while and it was entertaining although predictable. Too bad I can't say the same about this latest tome.It seemed like I waited forever for this latest release, only to be badly disappointed. I don't know about the rest of the Lehane fan's here, but I sure wish he'd get back to doing what he does best and that's writing great mysteries."
2,Writing that tries way too hard,"Being from Boston, I really wanted to like this book but I couldn't get through the first 3 chapters. Couldn't suspend disbelief enough about Babe Ruth's supposed conversations - I admit, I hate mixing historical people into fiction. Also, this book falls into the ""macho blue collar"" character narrative. The dialogue and all it's trying too hard ""toughness"" I just found over the top. Does anyone really talk like a tough guy all the time; the Danny character was just too much of the Irish tough guy Cop stereotype. I felt like I was watching an over-dramatic movie."
2,Awake..now that it's over,"I'm not a huge fan of the mystery genre. Always leaves me disappointed. That being said Lehane's one of its more talented practitioners especially ""Gone Baby..."" and ""Mystic River"". But this was flat out awful. Nothing compelling in the characters or story and just too damn long. And given the limp noodle ending I think even Lehane lost interest by the end. I sure did."
5,A 10-star novel for sure. Brilliant!!,"Wow! Nothing about this novel -- its characters, the story it tells, its language -- is less than perfect. I'm not sure what it means when people speak of ""the great American novel."" Whether or not TGD is ""the"" great American novel, it certainly rates among the greats. In my view, it is no exaggeration to say that TGD is among the best novels period. A couple months back I read Shutter Island -- fun read, nothing exceptional. I had no idea DL had a novel of TGD's caliber in him. I am rarely blown away by a work of fiction. TGD blew me away. Believe all the hype..."
4,One CD missing,Product arrived in good time and in selophane sealed box. However one of the three Cds was missing. I contacted Amazon immediatly and I have been advised that a replacement has already been shipped. I have to return the faulty product within a month or be charged for it also. Service and response - excellent!
5,Not the expected,"After reading the widely divergent reader reviews, I conclude there are two types of Lehane readers. There arethose that would want him to stick to the detective genre and those that are open to Lehane stretching his creative legs. I find myself in the latter group.This is a superbly accomplished historical drama. Congratulations to Lehane for having the courage to break form and give us something new and compelling"
4,History writ.,"I know everyone compares this to Doctorow or Dreiser--big doses of US anarchist, socialist, capitalist and racist history--but I have to compare it to the Pink Panther movie. The plot is chugging along so fast that you know they all are going to end up running in circles around Logan Circle (of course it's Boston with Lehane) but the question who will be wearing the gorilla suit and who the horse costume."
4,Worth watching,"Normally, I don't post for amateur movies unless they suck.This one obviously doesn't.That being said ...( - )The bass soundtrack is over amplified for whole movie.The special effects are a joke. I was laughing everytime they showed up ( e.g. gun shot stars in woods ). Sounds & imagination would have gone farther.The one guy was holding his gun by the muzzle. Hello, it gets hot when fired ... LOL( + )The cinematography is fresh, imagine Crank 2 without the suck.The hour went by quickly & keeps your attention.I wish the producer & cast much luck with their future endeavors.Good job!:)"
1,Executive guide is right.,"There is not enough detail here to make this book worth the money. Don't waist your time, there are many other books here that will fill in the details, this is not one of them."
1,the worst vaccum I have ever owned,"There are so many flaws with this vaccum it's diffult to narrow it down to just a few. But for the sake of space and time I'll say this about the outlast...1) there is almost no suction. I stood over a small pile of sawdust for about 60 seconds and less than 1/4 of it was actually picked up. I could go over a same spot on my carpet a dozen times and it would still only pick up maybe 30%...if I'm lucky. 2) It constantly spits debris out the back, on carpet and on bare surfaces. Actually kinda painful if you're in shorts or a skirt. 3) The Hepa filter is a joke - it was plugged within the first week. 4) Very difficult to vaccum stairs with. There are no hand holds and the attached hose has less suction than a turkey baster. Really - don't buy this vaccum."
2,REVIEW,"Siuzdak has written a useful book for the novice or a student without a background in biological mass spectrometry. The book's small size and concise treatise, however, gives rise to many trite and overly simplistic explanations of aspects of the field and some errors. Consider, for example, page 37 that describes that a limitation of magnetic mass analyzers is their relatively ""low"" resolution. This is contradicted in Table 2.1 where a correct representation of the resolution is made. Also on page, Siuzdak describes the ""physics behind"" ion trap and conventional quadrupole analyzers as being ""similar"" when ion motion and dynamics in each analyzer is quite different. A textbook to be read with caution!"
1,"Boring, Repetitive, Predictable","I, too, loved The Stone Diaries. At first, I enjoyed Larry's Party very much. However, each chapter's need to ""recap"" the previous story - how many times do we need to be reintroduced to characters? - was , in my opinion, something Ms. Shields did to fill enough pages to honor her book contract. I didn't care about ANY of the characters, except maybe Larry's parents. Just a really, really stupid book."
2,Book Of the year? Disappointment of the year!,"I bought this book to read on holiday, persuaded by recommendations on the cover that it was one of the Books of the Year 1997 for several newspaper reviewers. I found the repetive style of the book irritating, although I appreciate the allusions to mazes and particularly the 'revelation'at the ending. However, the content was sooo boring! I read the whole of the book - hoping it would get better. Although Larry was a pretty nice guy, at the end I resented the fact I had wasted so much time on such a Joe Average that let life wash over him and then had his mislife crisis! There were some funny moments, good character observations and I learnt some interesting things about mazes(!) so I might try another Carol Shields novel but I would definately NOT recommend this book nor believe the hype."
2,not her best,"very disapointing. pretty much a strange story about a man who goes through life completly lost.his fascination towards mazes emphasize his mere existence in the world.his two failed marriages are a joke. not really a very good book, considering the author."
4,What is a Man?,"Carol Shields is one of my favorite writers. In this novel she takes a look at what a man is by examining one man's endeavors, insights, genetics, socialization, sexuality and the women in his life.Who is Larry? He is is past and his present, what he thinks about himself and what he completely represses and obscures. He is a man, both a unique person in his own right and the representation of every man.Carol Shields explores Larry's life through his marriages, family of origin, friends, his penis, his brain, his past and his future. Who he is culminates in his party, thus the name of the book - 'Larry's Party'.Larry is, by profession, a maze-maker (landscape artist). Metaphorically, this book examines the maze of his life. He is lost and always wandering. We think of laughable, likeable Larry, but we feel sorry for him too.I highly recommend this book."
3,A maze of good writing,"Like Larry's beloved mazes, the author, Carol Shields, tells Larry's linear story in a circular way. In seemingly stand alone chapters, she leads us through the labyrinth of Larry's feelings. The writing was brilliant, stunning at times. Her protagonist lived his life like his first maze experience, lost because he wanted to be lost. The author gently brings him to a point that may, or may not, be clarity. This book almost gets a four because of the skill of the author, but a three fits better because of the slow, easy pace of the book, with no real climax. Still a very worthwhile read, and I recommend it."
4,Great - until the very end,"Carol Shields is a great author and I have read many of her books and was totally engrossed with her characters. With ""Larry's Party"", I loved it until the chapter entitled ""Larry's Party"" (the last chapter?). The ending was a let-down. The entire book builds the character of Larry up so successfully and intimately. The last chapter is anti-climatic or disappointing. It may have been better to not have read this chapter and just end the book by guessing the outcome on one's own. No regrets on buying this hardback though--expands my library of Carol Shields books."
