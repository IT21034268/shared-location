5,Works well. Lots of power.,"Received the rotary tool in excellent shape. It has plenty of power for cutting and grinding. The chuck does not use a wrench and can be easily tightened/ loosened by hand. The speed control wheel is a bit difficult change speeds, however this is not a problem for me as 99% of the time I use it on the highest speed. Highly recomend this product."
3,Kinky Cord,"This is an outstanding tool, cheaper and stronger than Dremel. The shaft lock defeats the power switch when applied, well thought out.It is a variable speed even though there are 1,2,3, divisions. My only gripe is that awful cord that is showing up on many appliances.It is permanently kinked. It causes trouble using and storing the tool. I have been replacing these cords on my tools with good quality wire,the kind that used to be standard. These kinky cords are more trouble than ""REBATES"", which also cause me not to buy.If manufactures want to make buyers angry, these kinky cords will do it every time!This would be five stars except for the cheap cord."
5,What a great work of Historical Fiction,"I found this book absolutely wonderful. A work of historical fiction that brings the characters to life, and makes them real.Sarah is 16 and living with her family in Concord during the revolutionary war. Her brother and father are off fighting the war, when the war comes too close to home for Sarah's comfort. A bristish soldier named James is wounded, and despite Sarah protests her mother takes him in and nurses him back to health. After some time the soldier gets better, and Sarah realizes that it isn't hate she feels for him.This is a wonderful story, and one that is very believeable. This is a definite must read for all ages."
5,"Great scope, Great price",It took just minutes to dial this scope in. It has clear optics even in low lighting conditions. It is a great scope at a good price. I will be buying another Prostaff scope for my other target rifle.
5,VERY PLEASED,I always do a lot of research when buying any product. Put this on my Winchester 30.06 Bolt Action for Carolina white tail deer hunting. This scope has many great reviews for a reason. I do not think that the quality can be touched for the money on this 3-9x40. Great scope. Very pleased.
5,AWESOME,Everyone talks about shot groups. I don't want to bore you with those details. I love this scope. It's great. You won't be disappointed.
5,Durable,I needed an abrasive pad to clean grout and the green ones left a green residue on the white grout. The SAIT white pads cleaned the grout and left it bright white. Saved me from regrouting.
4,Catches your attention,"This book kept me fully entertained. It had great depth as far as the character of the person. The main guy, Auri, was a mystery person who was really lost in the world. Grace was the girl who would be called little miss perfect. It starts out by Grace coming to New Orleans looking for her sister who always has been spastic but is now missing. Auri thinks Grace is the girl that will lead him to a bad guy he wants revenge against. Overall, a great book, good storyline."
5,Recommended,The second book I've read by Ms Bruhns and it was another great read. This is one author staying on my buy list.
2,maybe 2.5 stars,"I really tried to like this book, but it just had too many stupid moments for me. The educated heroine was not believable. The detective with the tortured soul wasn't believable either. I didn't really feel the chemistry was true between them, it felt a little forced. The suspense part of the story was a little weak also. This book just didn't work for me."
3,How old is Grace?,"Overall I liked this book but the main character, Grace, acts awfully immature, given that she is supposed to be a grown woman. Not knowing what a daquari is, not aware that drinking will get her drunk, going out alone and putting herself in danger, the usual goofy stuff that women in these types of books do. Other than that kind of nonsense, I think it's a pretty good read."
2,Sweet Revenge,"Too much sexual detail--not enough storyline, although I was irritated after the first 15 pages and didn't have any desire to read further."
2,I strongly disagree...,"I wanted to like this book, but the TSTL psychologist (with TWO degrees) heroine killed it for me. I couldn't suspend my disbelief long enough to believe that ANYTHING she did to the EXTREMELY DAMAGED hero was in any way healthy, or that his ""miraculous mental revelations and resolutions"" would have occured in real life. The lack of professionalism from ANYONE in this story made me so irritated that I found I couldn't enjoy the book... And I am neither a psychologist OR a cop, but I am intelligent enough to see that the author needs to do more research to be able to write these damaged characters into anything resembling a healthy relationship in a believable way. I shan't read anything else by this author."
4,Peace T-Shirt,"Good quality shirt. I LOVE the ""PEACE"" artwork. I wish the letters were a bit larger. Also, I ordered a women's small, and it seems really big for a ""small"". Overall, it is a great looking T-shirt with terrific artwork. I would order again, especially for my son or husband who would fit well into the larger sizes."
2,"Don't bother, buy full O'Reilly book","This quick reference doesn't do you any good. It's just as quick to look up something in a normal reference, not to mention a normal reference will provide you with more information. Everytime I tried to use this book, I had to go to my other reference because this ""quick reference"" didn't have the information I was looking for. Save your money and buy O'Reilly's Definitive Guide."
5,A thought provoking guide to What is Strategy?,"All the Right Moves grapples with the issues which form the essence of the strategic management field. Professor Markides provides readers with a landscape for strategy which covers: 1) positioning, 2) business system interdependence, and 3) dynamics of competition. Positioning is recouched in an easy to understand and apply framework based on a new Who-What-How combination. An important message is that positioning is only part of the story. Once position is determined, management must coordinate a complex system of interrelated and interdependent activities which typically extend beyond our cognitive limits of bounded rationality. Further, once these activities are coordinated for one position, the firm cannot stand still. Competitive dynamics erode away any advantage over time, and therefore firms must continuously question their positioning . I whole-heartedly recommend this refreshing and thought provoking book to managers and academics alike."
1,"(300-Pack) means 1 box, not a pack of 300","The headline says (300-Pack) but when we got it, there was only 1 box and the box was so small that you might be able to stuff a hamster into it, if you put the tail out one of the holes. I would NOT recommend this item to anyone."
5,Works great. Need to use the latest driver and firmware,"I had this card and the Airplus 614+. Both work very well after installing the latest driver and firmware.Very good speed, rich set of security features, and great sensitivity for the 650+ card (much better than Netgear or Linksys card that I tested)."
3,Not recomended for Linux users,"This card uses the TI ACX100 chipset. There is no supported Linux driver from TI or DLink for this chipset.The card works fine with Windows XP, although the range seems to be somewhat limited. I can use it upto about 30 feet, but it is going thought a wall. My overall impression is that it is basically a trouble free card with Windows.There is a number of people working to create a GPLed driver for Linux which seems to work. There is sufficent info on the internet to figure it out if you have the time. It would be nice to see offically supported Linux drivers from DLink."
3,Good when it works.,"This card is great when it works (once you get the drivers and firmware up to date, anyway), but seems to be prone to problems. I bought two of these cards originally, for two different laptops (one a Gateway, the other an IBM, both running Windows XP). All of a sudden, one laptop started rebooting spontaneously sometimes, then sometimes locking as Windows XP restarted, and sometimes it wouldn't turn back on at all. I was baffled by it until in desperation I tried popping the card out, and all of a sudden no more problems. I swapped the card with the other one and the exact same problems migrated to the other laptop. I called D-Link and they cross-shipped a replacement card (though it took most of a month to get it), which worked fine for a month and now seems to be causing the same problems again. I won't be buying another one of these."
2,Do not buy this if you are running Windows 2000.,"If you are confident in your ability to install this device in a computer running Windows 98SE on down, then it is a great product. D Link's current drivers for Win2K DO NOT WORK. I have been in frequent contact with their ""customer support"" (the """" are due to the lack of support I received), and they keep telling me to do the same thing (it's a form letter). I have followed their instructions EXACTLY without success. I have Win98SE on the same laptop, and it works beautifully. My problem with this, is I intended to remove 98SE from my computer, but now I'm stuck with it. Good luck, and buy Linksys."
3,Bothered by Bright Flashing Lights,"This card really worked just fine for me. Good throughput, trivial install, etc. Overall, I'm a big fan of D-Link wireless routers.However, this card has two rather large bright green LEDs on top of the card that FLASH back and forth all the time you are connected. It drove me up a wall and I returned it because of those annoying lights. A very subtle (see it when you look for it) light showing the connection status would have been a preferred design. My SMC (although 802.11b) card has a subtle orange light that is solid when connected, flashes when not connected. Its a much better design. I'm sure other cards are far less intrusive than this D-Link card."
2,It's 'OK',I purchased teh NetGear MA401 (11mbps) and the D-Link AirPlus DWL-650+ Wireless 22 Mbps PC Cards. Both connected to the Linksys 4port wireless router. So far the Netgear was much easier to install and works like a charm. Great speed and better performance than expected in every room of the house. The D-Link Airplus at 22 Mbps took much longer to get working and performs slower than the Netgear and also tends to lose it's connection to the Linksys for unknown reasons. It has never connected at 22 no matter where it is located in proximity to the Linksys. I expected the D-Link to out perform the 'slower' NetGear. I'll buy another Netgear at 11 before I buy another 'faster' D-link underperformer.
1,Trouble from the start.,"I bought this 650+ with a D Link AirPlus 614+, also supports 22 Mbps. Upon installing the software and rebooting the card came up ok for the first few time. Then it was not recognized by the computer and wanted to reinstall the drivers. Plus, the card did not let me connect to other computers on the network to transfer files. The card has been intermittent and pain. Very bad product or just this set of router and pc card. Do not recomend this line of products. The hub DHCP server died in less than six months. Several techs tried to install and setup and on several Dell laptops. Tried a Linksys USB card and it work great. So think again about purchasing this product."
3,"Windows likes it, Linux Doesn't","This little beastie uses a TI chipset that isn't supported by Linux, yet. *frwon* It does however work well in Windows, just as promised."
1,Works well if it's not defective,"The first one worked fine for about a day, then my HP Compaq nx9005 running Win XP failed to initialize it. Every time I plugged the card in the slot, Windows reported that ""The device has a problem"". The second one didn't work from the beginning: Windows would not even recognize it. Well, being a patient person and trusting numerous 5 star ratings of this card, I got another replacement which has been working flawlessly for about 2 weeks.If you have a problem, don't bother calling the tech support. They are useless. Get a replacement, and if you are lucky, you might get a non-defective one.Update: My replacement card also failed to perform properly. I gave up trying and returned the card. Extremely disappointed with D-Link."
2,"Does the job, just not recommend for a secure link","Having been given some of these cards I've found them to be quite irratic if you secure your access point.Yes the 256bits WEP works but you really should think about getting WPA instead.The range of the card is about OK although if on your wireless router you choose to 'not broadcast the SSID' then even if you explictly list this in the connection you will find it starts to connect and disconnect and become quite frustrating.If you are lucky you can enable this and limit your router access based by MAC and combined with the 256bit WEP should be secure enough for home usage.Dont by cheap buy Netgear!I bought the DG834GT what a truely excellent wireless router this is!Had bad experiences with DLINK in the past, linksys are also as troublesome!"
2,DROPS CONNECTION TO ROUTER CONSTANTLY!,"Tech support could not help, switching laptops did nothing. A replacement DWL-650+ showed the same symptoms. I then decided to buy a cheap wireless VCNET 22mbps card (9.95$) and it has never ever lost the connection to the router, the signal is consistently stronger (now I can use it in the back yard where as the D-Link) would drop to a red connection and within seconds lose the connect entirely.Just a waste of money, go with a no name brand, they work fine. The D-Link router (DI-641+ or better) does perform brilliantly though."
2,the new version of driver doesn't work with XP?,"Anybody has 2.02 or sth. version of the driver? I got the 3.05 with my replacement card and it wouldn't work. Even though I downloaded the latest one (3.07), it still doesn't help at all. With 2.02 I had before, it was just fine...so, I suspect it's because of these newer version. Btw, I have Windows XP."
1,Last Straw,"My complaints about the D-Link 650+/614+ products mirror most of the negative reviews:- Blue screens- System freezes- unstable performance- card goes dead and laptop needs reset- less than advertised speed- causes progressively slow laptop response- tech support was uselessSo I don't understand how others have had such great experiences.I even recognize the same shining reviews on other sites. Looks suspicious, does D-Link have a positive campaign to offset the negative reviews?I've had similar experiences with other PC/Laptops and third-party products so I give up. I am going back to the Mac. Good bye and good luck PC world!"
2,"It's okay, but not on XP","The AirPlus 650+ works well on Windows NT. I upgraded my notebook to Windows XP, however, and it stopped working. That is, it would still connect to my access point so the card itself works. But the ""D-Link AirPlus Utility"" no longer sees the card--it says, ""No card found."" If I keep my access point on its default settings, everything is fine. But the AirPlus Utility is needed for setting up WEP (encryption), changing the default channel, etc. If the utility cannot see the card, then you cannot configure WEP; the only way you can use the card is by opening up your network to the world. Terrific. I see that D-Link offers an XP driver for its DWL-650, but not for the DWL-650+. What's up with that? I have tried a lot of kludges involving a lot of drivers to no avail. It would help things if D-Link would get their act together.Bottom line: Avoid if you're on XP or thinking about going there."
3,Works great with D-link APs,"When I'm at home with my D-Link 614 AP, I love this card. When I am other places, with other APs I'm not always as lucky. I've had several occasions where I can't maintain a signal with a linksys or cisco AP. What's funny about it, is that with two linksys AP's-configured identically-I was able to maintain a connection with one and not the other. A similar situation occurred with Cisco.All in all for the money, the card works well enough. If you have a D-link AP that you'll primarily be connecting to, this would be the card to get. However, if you plan on connecting to many different APs, I would recommend a Cisco Aironet card."
2,"Range is exaggerated, slows connection","Disappointing 0.6 mbps speed, compared to wired speed of 1.2 mbps. Also, signal is weak only 80 ft. from wireless router. D-Link claims speeds up to 22 mbps, and range of over 100 ft! It's better than a 56K modem, but below what I expected."
1,Disappointed,"Have returned this card and purchased a Netgear MA51 that I set up in less than 30 minutes. The D-Link didn't fit in the card slot of my Dell 1100 properly (too tight) but how was I to know? Never showed getting power.The software was also a problem - an error ocurred during installation, and I couldn't get uninstall to work, either the D-Link or the XP Add/Remove programs.Talked to D-Link support for 30+ minutes - ultimately they thought the computer might be a fault and the card could be defective."
1,Very disappointing card,"I tried out this card because I thought all wireless pc cards would be about the same. Was I wrong! The signal was so weak that I couldn't even get past my hallway before I lost my connection. The card works great if you plan to stay within 10 feet of your wireless router, other than that, this thing is worthless. I returned the card as soon as I could and picked up a Cisco card that had MUCH better range. STAY AWAY from this card it's not worth it."
2,Horrible Range,"I have been blown away how bad the range is on this card. I experience drops every 5 minutes with this card. Ended up switching to an Orinoco Gold. Results, no more drops. Don't waste your money!"
5,Works well.,"After loading the software, my laptop found the wireless network instantly. It's so nice when things work how you hope they will. I've tried it with both Windows ME and XP Home with equally good results."
5,"Great item, works out of the box","Bought this card to use in my Linux laptop. I must say it works flawlessly out of the box, totally supported by the OS, no need to install drivers."
2,Warning - this card uses old technology,"I have this card, which I bought in early 2003. It's served me fine. However, our wireless access has been updated to current standards using WPA-PSK (Personal) with AES coding (This is the ""WPA2"" standard.)If you're sure you'll be using the old WEP - or even WPA-PSK with TKIP - I think this will work for you.But if you'll be upgrading to the latest standard, this will be a throw-away - I even called DLink and they said to buy a new card."
4,Worth the money!,I have had this card for about 6 months now and it works very well even after when there have been physical damages to it. Only problem I noticed is that it consumes more power.
2,It doesn't really work for Windows-XP,"I bought the DWL-650+ a few months ago for my old laptop computer. Recently I bought a new HP notebook with Windows XP and Athlon XP-M 2500+. The wireless card works fine when I use AC power for the new notebook. However, once I switch to battery power, it freezes the computer. I downloaded the latest driver from D-Link web site, spent many hours installing/uninstalling the driverand, and tried to figure out what was wrong. But it simply didn't work. Finally I gave up, and purchased a Netgear WG511 card. The WG511 works fine, only it loses connection to my D-Link DI-614+ quite frequently, which I don't know why yet. But at least it's working and doesn't feeeze my notebook."
3,"Good speed, bad range","The speed of the card is very fast, at 22Mbps, which means that on my 10Mbps wireless LAN, it is always at top speed. The card has very good 256bit encryption and it is very easy to install especially under Windows XP (you just put the card in.) It is fully windows XP compatable (Home and Pro editions.)The only problem with this card is the range is very bad. I have a Dell TrueMoble wireless card and when I use my other card and my friend uses his D-Link in his laptop (exact same brand, model, and OS as mine) I will have excellent range, and his will be poor or sometimes it will lose the connection.D-Link is on the cheap end of wireless cards, in terms of price, and it shows in the product. I would recomend spending a bit extra to get a mid or high end product, such as a Netgear or Cisco systems wireless card."
1,Shoddy construction,Unit worked well but began to fall apart a month after I bought it. I'm quite disappointed.
5,I am Enjoying my FAST Wireless Freedom,"When this is coupled with the DI-614+ router/access point the speeds are twice as fast as the conventional 802.11b @ 11Mbps and priced well under the 802.11a cards. I was amazed to find that this is even faster than cards rated at 11Mbps even when networked with 11Mbps access points or routers.I am very excited to be browsing the internet free from all wires and at speeds that don't annoy me. I can even play games over our LAN and not get a bad ping. The setup was super simple and the configuration settings are adequate for what you need to do. I don't think they could have made this any better than it already is. This wireless card is definitely ""top shelf"" in my book and I'd recommend it to everyone."
1,Terrible wireless card - screw D-Link,"I used this card for one year in the library of my university - and I always had problems obtaining a stable connection. I thought it was because of the signal. Then I used other friend's laptop there - one with a Netgear card, one IBM T41 with built-in wireless, geez, they all worked so well. So, the conclusion is: this D-Link just sucks! I am dumping mine and getting a new one.Don't buy D-Link. Never."
2,better with a rebate,"This product works ok most of the time. I would be happier if DLink would send my rebate but after speaking with them several times and sending most of the box, they still refused to send my rebate. I'd sell it if I could get a $1 for it and go with LinkSys."
2,all hype not action,"this wirless card performs quite poorly. First off, it has its own propreitery client software which contradicts the signals strenght that xp displays. The transfer rate is not impressive at all. The highest transfer rate I got was 6 MB and the wirless ap was right next to it ! Its all hype. The only impressive thing about it is the performace under wep when used with the 614+ router... no noticable perfromace drop at all."
1,Poor performance - doesn't work out of the box Win 98 se,"The DWL-650+ hads many short commmings, including abisimal performance. Instalation is is falt riden under WIN 98 SE. (The aplication would not complete the install.)I downloaded version 1.3 of the application from the D-link site. installed OK.Finally up and running, but stinky through put at 3 feet less than 1 Mb, zero throughput at 20 foot, My Socket communications CF 802.11b card is faster 11 Mb using same Dlink DI-713P router. I hope a firmware rev changes thingselse back to the MFG.One spot of good news; Tech support answered on the third ring (800 number) very knowledgeable... But alas, this product is only supported by a special D-link second level support contact."
1,WARNING: DWL-650+ May Corrupt HP Laptop Firmware,"WARNING: DWL-650+ may corrupt firmware on HP laptops. The DWL-650+ software would not install on my target HP Omnibook, so I tried it on my newest HP Omnibook, which already had built-in wireless. Performance review: the DWL-650+ worked irratically. After I uninstalled the D-Link software, my laptop's internal wireless was no longer functioned. I am a SW/HW engineer, and after 20 hours of work and calls to D-Link support, I believe that the laptop's original wireless firmware has been corrupted beyond repair -- a sickning price to pay. For me, nightime D-Link support was helpful; daytime support struck me as ignorant and rude. Their email response to my request for escallation: ""Dear: Valued Customer ... Agent Response: contact manufacture of computer ... Sincerely, Andre..."""
4,jhawk,"I just received this card, and found it to be acceptable. However is very sensitive, must have the notebook turned a certain way in order to get a good signal. It does work thoughout my house, driveway,deck,downstairs family room, haven't tryed the yard yet, maybe tomorrow. A good buy for the money."
2,"average card, poor support","I had this card with the DLINK 614+ and had lots of problems, mostly with the 614 loosing connection with the antenni. (is that the plural?) In any case, 45 minutes on the phone with tech support who were obviously not too bright, 30 of which was just getting through. I also called their pre-sales dept for some config recommendations and they were decidedly unhelpfull and it also took 30+ minutes to get through. I am now on a Netgear based config and while not specifically better in the basic config (I am using this to share broadband so I can't see any speed difference but others might) Netgrear does pick up the phone quickly and trys to help."
3,Inexpensive WiFi,I got this card for [item price] from [local store] and for the price it was great. It is quick to set up and lets my laptop connect at home anyware on up to 1/2 block away and I found that a lot people and businesses leave their WiFi connections open and unencrypted so I can surf in a lot of places around town. There is even a database I found of places that have connections. For the price it is great. But I'm not as happy about their router product.
1,Book promotes sexual experimentation with other boys,"I would NOT recommend this book for adolescent boys!! The author wants our young sons to believe that ""sexual experimentation with other boys is normal"" (pg.57). He tries to convince the reader that ""circle jerks, where boys sit around masturbating and see who comes first, happen a lot"" (pg. 57). The author describes these activities as ""normal experimentation and a learning time for boys"". These are actual quotes from Chapter 3.After reading this book, I did NOT give it to my son. What the author promotes as normal sexual development in an adolescent male is outrageous."
2,From Boys to Men,"I was disappointed with this book. I was looking for a book to give information about the changes a boy goes through---not put inappropriate ideas into thier heads. This books suggests that touching each other, experimentation, etc. are normal. This goes against the teaching of not letting anyone touch you in private spots."
5,From Boys to Men,"This book was concise, informative, and conveyed appropriate information in a respectful manner. I recommend this book strongly for anyone who has a son facing the adolescent years. My son learned a lot and it has opened the door for many conversations and questions."
2,Not what the average person needs,This is too big for a standard Motherboard. The capacitors are in the way.
5,Finding Effective Acupuncture Points,This book is a great learning tool for acupuncturists. It teaches a Japanese perspective on the art of acupuncture and how to optimize the effectiveness of treatment. It gives a wholistic view on how acupuncture is very individualistic. It highlights how it is a profound medicine that is so unique to each individual practitioner and helps guide the practictioner on how to recognize imbalances through the touch.
3,A book that indeed teaches with practical clues to locate the acupuncture points and to make a more conscientious treatment.,"This book belongs to a great master of ""Meridian Therapy"", that it possesses one of the best books on this theme: ""Introduction to Meridian Therapy"" (this book is extraordinary and indispensable to all and any acupunturist, be him linked to the acupuncture Chinese, Japanese or western. However, to know more about location of points, with clues of practical existence in the touch in search of the necessary location of the acupuncture points, without a doubt ""Finding Effective Acupuncture Points"" is of great aid. This book will contribute in the choice of the points to they be treated as the diagnosis done according to the school of the therapy of the meridians. This book is of great aid not just in the treatment, but also in the diagnosis of the disturbances of the meridians."
5,It was a fun read,Actually I bought this as a gift so my rating is based on the enjoyment I had reading these stories back in the late fifties - I loved them then and thought a friend would too.
5,Love this series of stories about salt-water angling in south Floria,"I read and loved the Crunch and Des stories many years ago while in high school. They are well written as you would expect from Phillip Wylie, This book would be of interest to any salt water sports angler, especially those from south Florida. I purchase this copy for my son and his sons to read. At some point I will have to borrow the book back so I can reread the stories!"
3,not so great,is a good product if you dont ride so offent.easy to put together.a little heavy.really hard to go up the hill.I still dont regret buying it. the fact that it doesnt use a chain gets a lot of attention from people
5,Inspiring,"The book is the BEST I have in my martial library. He gives step by step methods for living, training, even revenge all while still walking the honorable warrior path. All my friends who've read it have found it to be as inspiring as I found it to be. I bought it five years ago, and still I can't recommend any other book more highly. Excellent book."
4,Good Essay on What It Means to Be a Warrior,"Major Forrest provides an interesting view on what it means to be a warrior. He references several historical examples of warrior culture to provide a framework for his discussion. He wrote the book as something of a how to manual, but since most of it is his opinion and much of it is esoteric, it's hard to really take it that way. This could provide a useful resource for the career soldier, law officer or serious martial artist. I agree with his overall take that those with combat skills need to have a strong value system and sense of honor."
4,A Classic,"Forrest Morgan has written an excellent book that has been enjoyed by countless martial artists for quite a few years now. In its 300 plus pages, the book provides plenty of great information on a variety of topics related to the martial arts: from history to philosophy, from diet to strategy. Overall, the book is well written and contains stimulating ideas regarding the meaning of being a warrior. The main thing that prevents me from giving the book 5 stars is the fact that the author seems to have a somewhat rigid, self-important attitude. The ability to laugh at oneself is a wonderful quality and Morgan doesn't seem to possess it. Joe Hyams' ""Zen in the Martial Arts"", and Daniele Bolelli's ""On the Warrior's Path"" explore the same topic with equal depth in insight but with more sense of humor and flexibility. This, however, is a minor critique that doesn't take away the fact that ""Living the Martial Way"" is a very enjoyable book."
2,Typical martial arts hype - great for teenagers,"I probably would have liked this book in my teens, but after 11 years of training I can no longer stand all the b.s. martial artists delude themselves with.It's the 21st century - idealizing and identifying with 19th & early 20th century Asian masters and is little better than adopting the ""warrior"" practices of 12th century european knights.For most of the martial arts world it's like the Ultimate Fighting Championships, Vale Tudo, Pancrase and the other Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) events never happened or don't exist.MMA no holds bared fighters, Muay Thai Boxers, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighters are the true martial artists today - and they're not warriors.Warriors carry weapons, risk their lives and train to kill people: Soldiers, Marines, SEAL's."
4,Worth reading!,"My teacher told me to read this book and not without a reason. Soon I'll be tested for a black belt and he felt I needed another perspective or way of thinking on martial arts and why we practise.This book is interesting for every martial artist to bring the art into daily life. It's a 'must read' for any practitioner of a 'DO', a traditional way (like Aikido, Hapkido, Karate-do, Judo, T'ai Chi, Daito Ryu, JKD), despite your level.Some parts I don't agree with, for I'm an martial artist and not a warrior or soldier (like mr. Morgan). I'll make up my own mind on how I 'should think' (but maybe this is more my recalcitrant behaviour). It made me think about things.Forrest E. Morgan puts things into the right perspective and everyone (including the none martial artist) can learn form this book. Most interesting are the chapters on religion, nutrition and the warriors mind set."
5,Good book for warriors,This is an awesome book. I have read it several times now and enjoy it every time. Morgan is great at bringing Samurai concepts into modern times. I encourage every warrior to read it.
2,A well-written but shallow fantasy,"I read this book when I first started my training. I was appalled at Morgan's somewhat brutal and very elitist mentality. A chapter on ""suicide and revenge"", in this Century? The image of an austere, forbidding figure stalking through life, silently intimidating those around him? Sounded grim - and it is.Thank goodness my experience of martial arts has shown me the other way. Six years later, I can understand how Morgan's descriptions of stoic grandeur would appeal to those seeking fantasy in their practice, but it's a sure recipe for joyless existence.For a better introduction to the real heart of the Arts, try Joe Hyams' ""Zen in the Martial Arts"" or the collected sayings of Ueshiba."
2,The essence of reality is war? I don't think so!,"This book is well organized, but quite elitist and grim in its presentation of the topic. According to Mr. Morgan, warriors are an elite class, better than the rest of us mortals, evidently, and the only honorable way to live is to engage in seaseless struggle. There is nothing here about creating a more compassionate peaceful society, and no analysis of the ravages of war created by persuing a relentlessly militiristic model. Sure, we all need to discover our warrior capabilities, but we don't need more vigilantes in this society!"
2,Disappointing. Surprisingly flat and dull.,"I bought this book with high hopes that it would prove to be interesting and informative. It was neither. There are several other books which are more profound and employ a more whole-life integration approach to the topic. The general tone of this book is very militant and dogmatic. This book will appeal to warrior wanna-bes moreso than true warriors. As a veteran, I agree that war is a serious business, but read any book by a former SEAL and realize that one can be a serious warrior without being too serious."
5,Every martail artist should be required to read this book.,"Anyone who wishes to progress beyond the merely physical aspects of their training, and feels it is time to delve into the spiritual and moral issues surrounding their art, should read this book to get some real answers.The martail arts as a lifestyle, especially his emphisis on living the martail WAY, is essential for anyone who is progressing into the higher ranks in their art. There are far to many people who practice merely the physical aspects of their art, without having the reverence or respect for it that deserves. Hopefully this book will serve to enlighten. I know it helped me."
5,Great stuff!,Insightful and intelligent. Morgan has put a lot of thought and research into questions that arise for most martial artists.
2,A little too much for me...,"This book was ok, a bit dull, not an easy read. I have done martial arts for years, basically for fitness, self defense, etc. This book would be great for someone that lives to do martial arts or whose full time job is a martial arts instructor, but a little too over the top for the average everyday martial artist like myself. I don't want to knock the book, it just wasn't for me. I don't want to live like a samurai, I just like to do martial arts."
2,no cradle,"I thought it came with the cradle (which is what i really wanted), but it doesn't. I must not have read carefully."
2,Disappointing,"Connecting was easy. However, there is no difference in performance from when I connect to my PC's serial port. It does allow me to free up my serial port, but that's about all that's different. If you're looking for faster syncing, forget about it."
3,PalmConnect,"I purchased the PalmConnect USB-to-Serial adapter to sync my Palm Vx Handheld to my laptop. The item appears to have been created for mac users but will accommodate windows users also and did not work out for me, because updated drivers are no longer available.Moreover, PCCables sent the item promptly and it arrived on schedule. I had a positive experience and would order from this seller again."
1,"Doesn't work, doesn't work!! What a waste of my money and time!","And Palm's support is non-responsive if not non-existent.The management at Palm must feel that they have too many customers at this point in time. Apparently, to thin down their once loyal customer base they have foisted this aberration onto the market and still refuse to support it.I commend Palm if this is indeed their new strategy as it has worked perfectly in guaranteeing that I will never, ever be a future Palm customer."
3,Necessary but not elegant,"This provides the basic ability to sync your Palm device to your Mac through a USB connection. It does so, however, by fooling the system into believing the information is coming through a serial port. So it is a good thing to have but quite obviously a short-term patch to the problem of not being able to sync by USB. Newer Palm models appear to have the ability to sync directly by USB without the need for this kit and that is a great step forward."
1,Watch out for Windows 2000 support,The supplied USB drivers do not work with Windows 2000. Palm has some pre-release driver on their Web site but I could not get these to work with my Windows 2K installation. I don't doubt it might work for some people but not for me. I wasted a lot of time messing around with this. Windows 2000 has been our for how long and Palm still can't get this right? This one is being returned.
1,Palm M100 USB Kit,"It doesn't work. No matter what I tried on my WinXP laptop, I could not get it to work. I tried the suggestions at Amazon. I tried the suggestions at Palm. I tried the suggestions when I googled it. I downloaded every driver I could find that supposedly made it work. When that didn't do it, I even mixed and matched everything. Nothing got it to work. Palm USB kit is overpriced wishful thinking."
2,Not compatible with my PC running Windows 98 OS,"The instructions on how to install the hotsync software were inacurate and I was never able to load up the software on my PC. Once I connected the cable to my PC, it recognized the new hardware and installed a driver for it, but due to the problems I had installing the software, I was never able to get this thing to work."
3,Discontinued product - no support from palm,"I bought one about 3 months ago. Used it twice and it died. Palm could not offer a replacement since they discontinued this product.When it works, it works great. Got a second one and ordered 2 more one for my wife and a spare just in case..."
3,Conflict with Windows XP,I have the new Win XP drivers that I got from Palm site but when I try to unplug the usb cable (Windows running) the computer restarts automaticaly. I tried the Palm live support but they didn't help. I will wait for another driver.
2,I agree it's a racket!,"The product works just great. But the fact that I have to buy TWO connectors to get from my Palm to my iMac is ridiculous. I'm sure it makes sense to the inventory control people, but it is definitely not looking from the customer's perspective. My vote says -- make a cradle and a cable with USB connectors!"
1,$ for a connector?,"The CD contains obsolete software, and the new versions of the software are downloadable for free, along with the manuals. At LEAST provide JUST the cable for a reasonable price.Also, while Palm does not officially support it, even though it is an option in the HotSync options, you may be able to get InfraRed linking to work.This is price gouging. Shame on you, Palm."
2,"Good idea, but falls short.","This USB kit works fine, but with one major flaw. On my computer (G4 Macintosh), I have to unplug the USB cable EVERY time I restart, and then plug it back in after the computer boots up, or else I can not hotsync. This gets annoying after a while. I wish Palm would come up with a solution to this."
4,Modem consequences?,"Installed this adapter (not without hitches) in about 2 hrs. HotSynch appeared to load to IBM PC OKAY, and everything looks just like my desktop (with conventional serial port). The very next time I attempted to get on the internet after making the installation, my laptop reported a hardware problem and asked me to be sure my modem is powered and installed. Fain at Palm chat service wouldn't say whether or not they had received any similar product reports (he disconnected without answer). It may be a coincidence, but only collecting reports will tell. I don't see any other such reports here so far."
3,USB Adapter That STOPS,"GADGET JUNKIE FROM NEW ENGLAND Nice idea, but I have had two, one of which did not work out of the box, and needed to be returned the next day to the retailer. They seem to last aprox 7 months, before something decides to go haywire. This can be frustrating when you have a new laptop with ONLY USB and are 400+ miles from home. When it works it works great, although I have been known to ""stump"" the support people. Be carefull if you use WINDOWS Me."
1,USB....not,This is a joke for PC users. You do not get true USB connectivity with this adapter. You still get the same slow serial transfer speed givent that the uart int the Palms is not USB.
3,No Linux support,"It's worth pointing out that this serial->USB adaptor has no Linux driver and will not work at all with Linux at this time. :( Palm has made no effort to make the specs available.If you need an adaptor that works under Linux, check http://www.linux-usb.org for a list. Apparently KeySpan's work well...-Hollis"
1,Forget OS X,"I don't know what planet the positive reviews come from. The device has not ever successfully handshaked with my powerbook G4. I downloaded palm desktop 4.1, and even tried the isync conduit (which requires that the handshake occurs - which it does NOT). Based on my experience, this product will not allow you to connect to OSX. None of the information I could find on the web was helpful. Perhaps the latest positive review is by someone with a lot of these sitting around to unload on the unsuspecting?"
1,PalmConnect USB Kit doesn't work with macosx 10.3.9,"PalmConnect USB Kit doesn't work with macosx 10.3.9 with my old Palm IIIx. I tried all the advice from Palm, from other users who had posted at various places on the web and could not make it work. I sent it back and got a refund. Then I got a new Tungsten E2 which uses a USB connector."
1,Not for Windows ME on a laptop,"After spending three hours trying to install the proper drivers from the Palm website (both with and without tech support) and configure my Thinkpad laptop that runs on Windows ME, I've decided that, contrary to advertised, this converter won't work on my laptop. The tech person even said so much saying that I had to contact my hardware manufacturer and have them reassign COM and SERIAL ports. That's waaay too much of a headache for me, and no one is promising that it will work after going back to the hardware manufacturers.Bottom line, it sounds great but it was too tough to get working for me on my IBM laptop running on ME. For a reference, I am not a computer novice; I'd give myself a 7.5 or 8 out of 10 in terms of ""techy aptitude""."
1,believe it...it doesn't work,"I should have paid more attention to all the grumbling that was going on in the previous reviews....Palm's USB connector does not work under WinXP. Prior to installing this thing, I went straight to Palm's website to get the latest drivers and instructions. I also followed some of the helpful tidbits given in previous reviews (e.g., make sure ""local serial"" and ""local usb"" are checked in the hotsync manager), mucked around with COM settings, etc. Nothing worked. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this thing until Palm updates their wonky drivers for WinXP. Palm has just lost another customer."
1,Typical Palm Nightmare,"I have come to hate dealing with anything having to do with connecting the Palm to my PC. Rarely does anything work, at least without a considerate effort, or without making another purchase. The cradle wouldn't work without buying a connect kit; the Palm folding keyboard wouldn't work without loading yet more software. This connect kit was suppose to load and enable me to use the USB port. Typically, it doesn't launch as described. I suppose when I call tech suppost (if they answer), I will need to buy something else or load more software to make the USB adapter work! My rating of Palm has gone from 'good' to ""I'd buy something else if I had it to do over again."""
5,Palm-USB Connect works well,"After reading some of the negative reviews here, I wasanxious about buying the Palm USB connect kit. But I'mhappy I did purchase it because it has worked like a charm.In addition, the price from Amazon.com was ...LESSthan what Palm was charging, and Palm didn't even have itin stock whereas Amazon.com delivered within a couple of days of receiving my order."
3,"It works, but...","This did work for me but it took a little something to get it to consistently work. Palm was good via email support. Be warned they told me to download Palm desktop 4.0.1 not 4.1 for windows XP! So I needed to uninstall 4.1 and download/install 4.0.1 and then download/install the driver for the USB port. There are also some settings that need to be set properly for hotsyncing. You need to make sure that in the settings for hotsync it is seeing the ports on your pc under the local tab. Also watch out for port conflicts with your modem. Be ready to play around with it and it might be a little frustrating. The only flaky thing now is when I put my PC to sleep, I have to unplug and plug in the USB cable to get it to hotsync. Fun, fun, fun getting older technology to work with newer. It was worth the couple of hours and [small] investment in the cable rather then at least $150 for a new PDA."
5,Very Good CD,"I would recommend getting this CD....it's refreshing to hear something that's not a remake....very original. Upbeat, lots of soul!!"
4,"Lacks the ""real"" Elgar!","Like other reviewers, I just want to say that this set lacks the famous Elgar recording by Jackie Du Pre. The Elgar performance on this CD is dull in comparison to her more famous performance. So, you will have to buy a separate CD for the Elgar. Other than that, this is a great set to have. I love the two Haydns especially."
5,Moving,"This book provides a clear and moving story of what it's like to have a fairly autistic child. It reinforces my belief that autism (or at least some of the personalities classified as autistic) is one extreme of a range of human personalities. I was surprised at the extent to which Alex's personality is an extreme version of the personality I had as a child.The author demonstrates an unusual ability to treat his son as an equal for some purposes (such as logical reasoning) while simultaneously being aware that Alex finds it extremely hard to learn concepts most of us take for granted (e.g. the difference between lying and pretending).Many of the problems people have interacting with Alex closely resemble the problems AI researchers discover when they try to translate an ""obvious"" concept into unambiguous language. But just when I thought the AI analogy provides a reliable guide, I noticed an exception - Alex finds long division harder than economic theory."
5,A must read for anyone touched by Autism,"This book was loaned to me by my son's nurse practitioner. I hadn't heard of it, but now I'm encouraging everyone I know to read it. This is a great book that demonstrates the true ""human"" feelings of being a parent of a child with autism. I was deeply touched by the honesty displayed in this book, and found that my thoughts, experiences, and feelings are mirrored by the author's. I appreciate his willingness to expose his heart for the purpose of educating others about autism. This book is a must read for any family member or friend of someone who has autism."
4,"great. fun, sharp",i was looking for a lens that i could do close ups with and lensbaby appealed to me. i saw some shots taken with them on shuttercal.com and went to the lensbaby site. pretty cool. i bought the muse and the focusing took a little getting use to but when you nail a shot it's pretty dang cool. i will save some money and probably invest in the composer which looks like it will hold the focus. get it and add fun and interest to your photos.
3,Close-up Filters,"In my house we have 2 sets of Lensbaby Macro Kits, the old style and the new. The new (AMACK) is ok but the old style is better made. Pictures seem to be same quality."
1,Not FOR W2K,P1$$P00r Compatibility issues found across the www. Don't be Too late to get informed. D-Link support even less helpful than a diaper against a dam break. System lock-up maybe resolved by diabling this or that or removing other PCI devices.
1,Crashes computer,"Installed it in an XP machine w/ MSI K2T combo board. It crashed my computer several times. It either freezes as XP boots or freezes after completed booting. Installed it in a different computer, did not freeze but was unable to connect to netgear router. Frustrating!!! Spent several days tweaking I'm finally giving up and getting another brand."
1,Beware - major software bug causes blue screen crash,"D-Link has a major problem with it's products (including the 520+) crashing systems on power down with a blue screen and a message stating that there has been an NMI parity error in hardware. You system will be locked up. Pulling the power cord is the only way out.What is REALLY bad is that I have 3 ""Case I.D's"" requesting a fix. If... if you own certain Compaq models you may... may be able to fix the problem with manual modifications to your system BIOS. However, unless you ""get lucky"", you are stuck. There is, apparently, no real customer support at D-Link, only an automated response system that patronizes you with the issuance of a case I.D.Be very, very careful about purchasing D-Link products. Buggy software and NO technical support nor issue resolution."
2,Doesn't work with Soundblaster live,"I upgraded from a smc2662w because the smc card would scan (stop all transmission) every 15 seconds and would repeatedly kill my vpn connection.I upgraded initially to the linksys PCI card... only to find out that it didn't work with XP.I traded that in for a dwl-520+, but it doesn't seem to work with my soundblaster live card (can I buy a break?!). I'll give tech support a week to figure this out (right...), then I'm sending it back. The only bummer is that without the soundcard, my network connection is great!"
3,"Good product, horrible customer service!","For a novice computer guy installing this card to coincide with the wireless router we recently bought. It was simple getting the router hooked up. But getting this PCI wireless card now that was another story. So i called their top of the line customer service. I spent two hours on the phone with one worthless tech support guy and got nowhere. I called back and after spending 45 minutes on hold waiting for a guy I finally got someone that knew what was going on! Since i've had it up and running it has been pretty reliable but once in a while it decides to disconnect for about a half-hour to an hour but other than that its a pretty decent connection but it damn well should be since the other computer is just on the other side of the wall! So if you don't know what you're doing expect to spend a lot of time dealing with the customer service rep, but all in all not a bad product."
1,"Don't buy - Don't work with soundcars, no Linux, no help!","I bought this card, the router and a PCMCIA card. But unfortunately I discovered after the return period of the dealer, that my computer will reboot when recording sound. After calling D-Link I tried two SoundBlaster and one Yamaha card, none worked.There is also no Linux driver available and no support for the Linux developers to write one. This should not be supported by buying this card.D-Link is not willing to take their card back or to exchange it. So, save yourself some trouble and buy some other card that works with soundcards."
5,Works Great and the Install was a Snap,"I don't like to see bad reviews here for a product I just bought, but I'd have to say I haven't experienced any of the symptoms other people have described.Install was a snap, and I've had this up and running for about 3 days and nothing has gone wrong. The signal strength is good and the speeds are fine.I will see if I can do an update here if anything goes wrong. So far everything is working great so I have to give it 5 stars. I have no complaints."
1,revell 1:77 ford tri motor,"I WAS VERY DISAPPONTED AFTER L OPENED MY PACKAGE AND SAW THAT L WAS ONLY MAILED JUST THE WING, INSTRUCTIONS AND NOTHING ELSE.THIS IS JUST SAD."
4,Interesting,The writing is a bit spotty in places but I was interested in learning more about Coryate after reading about him in some Bill Bryson books.
2,"2 Great Albums, but very poor sound quality","I love Roy Buchanan very much and these are 2 of my favorite albums of his possible his 2 best and since these are basically out of print I jumped at this chance to get this CD. But I regeted it because the sound Qaulity is very poor it sounds muffled like it lacks treble I personally think it is A bootleg but I;m not sure,bad sound is ussually a tell tale sign that it is. The packaging on the CD is very good but if I were you I would wait for them to be rereleased. I hope the makers of this CD see my reveiw and chaleng me on its merits if it is real or A bootleg."
5,Master of the Telecaster,"I just received this album two days ago. I bought it in spite of the one negative review that said the sound quality was poor and I'm glad I did! This is not a remastered version of these two albums, but in my estimation the sound quality is excellent considering that this music was recorded in the earley '70's. Roy Buchanan was one of the most expressive guitar players ever. Listening to him is like listening to a conversation without words. The message comes through loud and clear. These are perhaps his two best albums and I heartily recommend them. The second album by itself is almost impossible to find. The two together is a sonic revelation!"
2,a dissapointment!,"If you are a serious collector of early photos,this is not the book for you.Besides the terrible organization of photo subject and type reference,some of wich have no reference at all,some of the photos would probably be already quite familliar to you,and are all done over in this sepia like tone instead of their true colors.As well,some of them are not quite so early.The text is taken from books of other people who have done great works on crime photogrphy,(Eugenia Parry),and so are the photos.if you want artsy,you might appreciate it.If you want a serious book on early photos of crime or the like,don't waste your money"
2,Get out of the Way,"While the photographs here were shocking, they were also exploitative. Just because they are old does not lessen the impact of photos of murdered children and freaks of nature. I am not sure what this book wanted to do, but it did not do it well. It is like reading a book version of the trashy Faces of Death video series."
4,A clean romance novel,"I bought this book to read aloud to a 97 tear-old woman who loves romance novels. Her eyesight is failing, and she can no longer read herself. I did not want to read any torrid excerpts to Lydia, lest I embarass her (or myself).I imagine I could draw guite a crowd in the nursing home. Anyway, the book is adequate in that respect, there are no explicit sex scenes. As a historical novel, it was pretty good, I noticed no obvious anachronisms, other than the language usage is quite current. This serves the reader well, and cannot be held against the author.I did not get to read it aloud to Lydia, she had second thoughts about the process but accepted the gift of the book. Presumably she is more comfortable with someone else reading to her."
3,disappointing ending...,"I found this book very entertaining until the last quarter of the book. It became dull and uninteresting. I went from not being able to put it down, to barely making it to the end."
2,Plot Doesn't Hold an Interest,"Well, I bought this book for vacation and have to say that it was a disappointment. After 14 chapters I threw in the towel. I found the dialogue trite and it just didn't hold my interest."
4,Somewhat Frustrating,"I do love Lynn Kurland's books, and I was excited to get this one. However, I have spent some time being frustrated because the hero and the heroine take entirely too long to smooth things out. I like Robin, as heros go, but geez, he spent too much time hurting Anne. Of course, when they finally do patch it up and get together, it relieves the frustration, but I hope Ms. Kurland doesn't allow any more characters to spend this much time getting together."
3,Too long but enjoyable. Not sorry I read it.,"Overall, I enjoyed the book. It could have been shorter by having less misunderstandings between Anne and Robin. There was no need whatsoever to compromise Anne's reputation by Robin's guarding Anne alone in his father's bedchamber to save her from murder. One of his sisters could have stayed with Anne while he was in the room. I was also a little disappointed in the wrapping up at the end. I enjoyed Robin's attempts at wooing Anne. I really didn't understand Edith's plans to get Artane. How could Robin's death have resulted in her getting Artane? She was hardly next in line to inherit it. Either it wasn't explained or I missed that part."
3,story line was good but didn't like the book,"It was sort of romantic so I kept reading it thinking it will get better but It didn't. Being me, I had to finish what i started but i found myself skipping the pages where it's slow."
1,By page 300 I had lost the will to live........,"I used to enjoy reading this series, but the last few have been so incredibly weak that I have to ask, ""WHAT HAPPENED?""The ridiculous plot is only outdone by the truly AWFUL dialogue. (Granted my life is relatively sedate, but I have never met people who warranted that many exclamation points in real life.) The characters are unbelievable and the ending seemed more like a cartoon than a mystery novel. ..."
4,A big improvement over Stalker....,"I have enjoyed all of the previous books in this series, but Kellerman seems to be falling into a rut. The story is interesting and the characters are as well-developed as usual, and the relationship between Decker and Jacob is very well done, but the ending was WAY too pat (a mountain lion, for heaven's sake??!!) and all the loose ends were wrapped up too easily. Too many coincidences. I would have rated this book a 3, but it is so much better than Stalker I had to give it a 4."
3,Good story with a very poor ending,"I enjoyed reading the book, the family of Decker is very interesting. The unfolding of Jacob's life was very well done and the relationship between him and his step dad is fascinating. But why did the killer kill 4 people, I thought that the character development of the killer was very poor. Yes, he has a split personality and yes he had a very sad upbringing, but why did he kill Ernesto and his therapist, and the wife, etc. I just didn't buy the ending."
3,A forgettable audiotape of a so-so mystery,"If you are Jewish, and a diehard fan of Kellerman, read the book instead of listening to the tape. Boutsikaris couldn't be bothered to learn the correct pronunciation of the Hebrew and Yiddish that Kellerman sprinkles throughout the book and he absolutely butchers it. I found this so distracting that it made it difficult to concentrate on the plot, which was only moderately suspenseful and somewhat convoluted."
3,"Decent story, good characters, unresolved ending","While I still enjoy Faye Kellerman's novels (I've read them all), I found this ending a bit unresolved. I could not really see the rationalization for why the killer would kill 4 people. While there were some explanations given, I just didn't buy it. However, this story was much better than STALKER."
2,Dull,"First of all, I will not bore anyone with a complete review of the plot (since most everyone else has). It is enough to say that I have also read (like many others) all the books in this series. In my opinion the storylines are getting dry and dull. Unlike some other reviewers, I am not disturbed by the religious subtext. After all, the main characters in this series are Orthodox Jews. Obviously there will be references to the importance religion plays in their lives. The plot started out interesting but soon turned boring. I forced myself to finish the book. The interaction between Rina, Peter and their children are becoming far more interesting than the storylines. I think the author needs some new, interesting ideas for her mysteries."
2,Almost good,Albeit the hidden main story is really good you'll have to strive real hard to find it and that's the worst a writer can do. Why not just keep out all the gibberish and make a real thriller? Why write just for filling pages and pages? Why keep the readers boring?
1,Waste of time and paper,"This story's setup and most of the minor characters are actually somewhat interesting. However the ""villians"" are lame and the two protagonists (Lazarus and Decker) are annoying. The book's cover and early chapters suggest that the author may weave some interesting historical or religious facts into the story so that the reader at least learns something - but no. And the plot goes, well not exactly nowhere, but it's hardly engaging or believable.Instead of putting my copy in the box of stuff to be donated, I put it the recycle bin - I couldn't bear even indirectly being responsible for someone else suffering through it."
2,Why write more?,"Not reading any of the series to date, I found this plot interesting at first then hard to close in the end. I believe this comes from the authors attempt to involve so many characters from the series. She dives into a few paragraphs of relationships and descriptions of the detectives then swings to the criminals without completing the dynamic. Also, the plot ends 14 pages before the book ends. Where is the author going? Being a reader of authors this book does not make me want to go back to the previous 13 in the series."
3,"Watch out, Faye. You're going downhill!","I have read all the books in this series, and they have been going steadily downhill. In this one, the plot is rather weak, the killer linear, Jacob's involvement rather forced, and most of all, Rina's character has become intolerable. she started being a charming widow, and now comes accross as a nagging, ill-tempered, obssesive, impossible wife. One wonders what keeps Decker married, and the author fails to show it. it was not a satisfactory read; slow, weeeak plot,unsubstantial killer,no interesting side characters (Cindy, Marge,etc) and putting up with Rina on top of all that was TOO much! Change her or eliminate her, please! Maybe the plots will improve then"
3,Middling adventure for a favorite orthodox duo,"Faye Kellerman poaches a bit from her hubby in this Rina/Pete outing, dabbling a bit in adolescent psychology and the nasty hijinks of mental health providers. It mostly works and kept me turning pages until the characters' motivations unraveled and the sanctimony around Rina's cleanup of a descrated synagogue got too excessive. A nastily misogynistic portrait of a young femme fatale also had me wondering about Faye's own mental health. Must women be either trollops or sainted orthodox housewives in her world? Entertaining but still far short of her best."
1,not her best by far,"Sorry... children do not read their parents minds accuractly. Never! Faye should just give it up and write a new series. One where there are no children...and a husband. Do they live in the twilight zone or what? Reality...not here, not in this last book. Some very politically correct stuff...boring...If she has an adjenda, please write a non-fiction book."
3,Not her best work,"For years I have enjoyed Faye Kellerman's Decker/Lazarus novels and I have eagerly anticipated each new book. However, the plotting in this one is sloppy, motivations are unbelievable, and the ultimate end of the truly ""bad guy"" (being eaten at night in the dark by a mountain lion) was cheap. I wish she would stick to well-designed detective stories developing further the relationship between Rina Lazarus, Peter Decker, and their extended families."
2,Not what is looks like,The picture on the front is not at all what the movie is about you only get to see Margaret for about four minutes in the whole film.
2,Very Poor Video Quality,"Bought this from the United States Amazon site, as although its a funny old British comedy we don't have it for sell here in the United Kingdom only bootleg copies. I wish I had not bothered as the quality is so bad it virtually makes it impossible to watch, I think it was sourced from a 16mm print thats what it looks like anyway. I believe it was released on VHS years ago & as this format has gone the way of the dinosaur(here in the UK anyway) this would have been a better copy to transfer to DVD than this poor quality version available here from Amazon.com"
5,"Symphonie Phantastique, Berlioz","This is a magnificent recording from Maestro Riccardo Muti, I understand the ""first chapter"" released out of a series of eight ""Concert Lessons"", where Maestro Muti will explain to us eight masterpieces from great composers (Berlioz, Verdi, Schubert, Rossini, Cimarosa, Mozart, Paisiello and Dvorak). In this first ""concert lesson"", Maestro Muti wisely explains to us this masterpiece from Berlioz and also allows us to realize the great importance of conducting, working together with ""Orchestra Giovanile Luigi Cherubini"". Congratulations for this excellent and unique recording and we really hope the next seven chapters coming up; which of course will be useful for those people studying music but also for any fan of the art of conducting.Fernando Martínez, Chile"
4,It's old timey and it has strong folk roots.,"Well, it's old timey now and it has strong folk roots; but strictly speaking, most of it's not true African folk or traditional music.For one thing, the primary instrument is the guitar, which was brought to Africa by Europeans. The styles also vary considerably with West African call and response vocals mixing with popular European and American styles similar to show tunes, country music, folk ballads and more."
4,good set,"I've always dug the Whispers.they are one of those Musical acts that you gotta play at cook Outs,Card Games,Dominos,etc.. there music has so Much Soul&togetherness.this set continues that vibe.the title track alone is still Slamming.""I'm the one for You"" has some Sick String arrangements&those Vocals knock you out.these Brothers should be in the Rock&Roll Hall of Fame like Today.they have been putting it down for a Long time&haven't slowed up a bit."
1,Hoo ... hummmm,"* Ordered along with the Olive Drab Shoulder Bag, but never received it. If and when it does arrive, I will update this item."
1,Save your money. It doesn't get much worse than this.,"I was unfortunate enough to flip through this collection of new-age psycho-babble the other day and found it to be very much in line with the 1970s-era southern California mysticism regarding these supposed hominids. Lots of speculation, very little data, and an overall feeling of being bamboozled. There are good data sets out there for the existence of a large, undocumented hominid. But this book is content to rehash stale ideas about the supernatural and goes nowhere fast. Better to spend your time on the many geeky, free-for-all web sites out there that cover the same material than waste your money on this book. If you're really interested in Bigfoot, check out the golden standard, John Green's Sasquatch: The Apes Among Us, or Grover Krantz's book Big Footprints. Leave this one to the Star Trek croud that still live in mom's basement. Cheers!"
1,ear book light,This item is junk. The button stuck and couldn't get the light to go off and the ear piece is made of cheap plastic and it broke the first time it was used.
5,Excellent Introduction to the Six Sigma Fundamentals,"I am a recent Graduate of Engineering and found this book to be an excellent introduction to the foundations of six sigma and problem solving. Dr. Stamtis goes beyond slogans and mission statements and describes the mindset an organization has to be in order to be successful. His book has helped me better understand the six sigma methodology and how it relates to the corporate environment in which I work.In this book, Dr. Stamatis discusses, in easy to understand English, the organizational structure for the six-sigma implementation, and quality methods used in six sigma. This book is a must for all Engineers who are interested in understanding the fundamentals of six sigma.I thoroughly enjoyed and the read, and plan on reading the entire series."
2,Region Code Problems,Product appeared to be new on amazon but arrived as a used copy. I live in Australia and of course the region code for the product was not compatible with Australian videos. I cannot seem to be able to get a replacement either. Not a happy purchase.
4,Very Good,Don't play them all at once. Spread each disk out over time to watch and enjoy the history. I enjoyed it.
4,Civil war dvds,This was a gift. It was an item the recipient wanted and we were so glad that you had it. Thanks.
5,The Classic Civil War Series,"Incredible! I had never taken the time to watch it before. If you haven't seen, take the time. Its worth it."
4,Good ........,.it was well rounded and did not go for one or the other side....great for learning entertainment and knowledge..and beer
3,faulty last disk,"Although the film itself is a fine example of historical reporting of this event and I have no criticisms of it, I was disappointed by the fact that the last disk was faulty and I couldn't see the final part. I reported this to the third party seller who promised to replace it but, even after a reminder from me, never did."
5,An Objective Work of Art,The American Iliad---Ken Burn's masterpiece treats the war as if it were a Greek tragedy and delivers a stunning work of art that will keep you riveted for the entire thirteen hours .A film that changed forever the way non-fiction films are made . Burns knew the War was the defining moment in American history and he treats the subject with that level of respect. This is I believe the most important film you could give your children .
5,Never Been A Better Documentary....EVER!,"I swear there has never been a better use of television! No one ever told the story of Lincolns genius and bravery better than Ken Burns! We would not be what we are today had it not been for Lincoln. By far our greatest President! I firmly believe that throughout history, certain people are put on this earth for a reason. Lincoln was put on this earth to see us through the end of slavery and the Civil War. Amazing that once it was over he was gone, much as Kennedy was gone shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis!"
4,Ken Burn`s Civil War DVD set,"The DVD SET I received was not the Comm. set I had ordered even though it also contained six dvds. Missing was the extras that were touted in the write up.(Battle maps,profiles of main players,etc.)I`m disapointed......BJB."
5,The Absolute Best Civil War Documentary,"Even if you turned down the sound and just watched the pictures for 10 hours, this would still be the best documentary ever made about the Civil War. The photographs that Ken Burns has found and the way he uses them tell the stories in ways never done before. Add to that superb narration, excellent voice acting (including Sam Waterston, Morgan Freeman, Jason Robards, and many more), engaging historians, and a perfect soundtrack and this series is a must see. This is Ken Burns at his best. It's not perfect, and there are a few inaccuracies, but the power and emotion that is drawn out through this series is something everyone should experience."
5,The Best Film on the War between the States so far!,"I frankly think that this is the best film made about the Civil War. Burns does a great service to all those who took part in the war and the nation that was shaped by our ""greatest"" War. As Shelby Foote so wisely put it, ""It was a divide in the road and a hell of a divide it was"". (The War basically made us the Nation that we are for better or worse and I like to think for the better)The use of the old photos and the actual terrain by Burns was frankly brillant.It really helps one gets a feel for what it must of been like and what the people of the war thought and behaved. I think that this film will be watched & enjoyed by future Americans a 100 years from now."
5,The Civil War,"Well researched containing a wealth of little known information along with excellent photography. I first viewed this on telivision when it was released in the early 1990's and have wanted to own a copy since then. The re-issued DVD version appears to be of even better quality.History can be a dull subject unless taught by a good teacher. I would highly recommend the use of this video as an aid to to teaching U.S. History or the Civil War.This rates as well as Ken Burns excellent recent film, The War, released in late 2007."
5,PBS - Please Release THE CIVIL WAR on DVD NOW!,When is PBS going to release this modern masterpiece on DVD?
5,Greatest documentary ever made.,"I have owned this on VHS and decided to get an upgrade. I am always amazed by the depth and personality of this excellent work. If you don't buy it for yourself, buy it for your children."
1,Defective manufacture,"The Ken Burns documentary of the Civil War must be the best undertaking of its kind ever. Unfortunately, the manufacturer of the DVDs seems to have added an intermittant wobble throughout the entire series making it unwatchable. I checked my dvd player and it is sound. I returned one shipment only to find that its replacement was just as bad. This is very disappointing since I'd love to have had this series on dvd. I wonder if others are experiencing this problem."
5,Must-have for any Civil War buff,A long time ago I had taped this from PBS--all 15 hours. I decided it was time to get it on DVD and not have to worry about my VCR giving out. Next I will have to replace the soundtrack tape with a CD. Both the documentary and the music are so well done. Ken Burns has earned his reputation. Everything he does is quality.
5,A Truly Great Documentary - Highly Recommended,"This Ken Burns ""The Civil War"" documentary is nothing short of amazing! Both my wife and I are Civil War buffs and jumped at the chance when we had the opportunity to move only a few minutes away from Gettysburg, PA.This 5 disc, 11 hour documentary uses narration, still photos (with the now famous ""Ken Burns Effect"" of moving along the image and creative use of sound effects), and historian interviews to cover every aspect, from the reasons for the war to the tragic events shortly afterward. The production quality is very high since this was made for PBS broadcast.While this is a documentary about a very bloody war (and there are plenty of disturbing images), the most memorable and touching segments are the personal stories told from the letters and diary entries from common soldiers and civilians on both sides of the Mason Dixon Line. More than one of them brought a tear to my eye.This is an absolute must own for any history buff!Highly Recommended!CFH"
5,The Civil War...Ken Burns,This was everything I had been led to believe that it was. I came to appreciate the great examples of honor and commitment that were found in the men who helped to preserve the Union and lay the foundation for the great nation that we have today.
5,Great,"Bought this as a gift for my husband. We haven't seen it yet, but if Ken Burns did it, I'm sure it is wonderful."
5,Highly informative and captivating!!,I highly recommend this series from Ken Burns. His works are always interesting and entertaining. My family learned a lot about the civil war by watching this series. I am definitely going to seek out his other documentaries to purchase. I purchased this box set through Amazon and got a great deal!!
5,"If you like Documentaries,",You will love Ken Burn's Civil War. Mr. Burns has the ability to take you there and put you in the middle of the action. You have a chance to meet and understand the main characters at that time in history. The photography and commentary are excellent. This is a set that anyone would be proud to keep in their library and view again and again or save for a child's later education or share with friends.
2,Not worth the price.,Very elaborate and a bit confusing material - but most importantly: this documentary video package is way too expensive. There are better Civil War documentaries on the market for less than half this price!
1,The War Between the States,This PBS history lesson shows that Ken Burns knows how to spin the Federalist position as saviors of the Union. It does not do justice to the many brave lads who fought and died defending their homes and lifestyle against the vicious invading forces of Mr. Lincoln. Certainly the winners write the history books but the honor of those brave men and women of the South will live on forever. Addionally no one should ever forget the brutality of the federalists both during and after the war between the states.
1,DVD doesn't work in Ireland,"We bought 'The Civil War, A Film by Ken Burns' through Amazon. It only arrived last Thursday, January 29th and we also had to pay import tax of almost 19. When we went to play the DVD's we discovered that it is only for use in USA and Canada, and is therefore not suitable for European viewing!How can this product be sold outside of the USA if it is not compatible with Irish/European DVD players. It also states on the box that it is licensed for sale only in USA and Canada!Perhaps someone could enlighten me here?"
2,Nice Fiction,"Too Bad it isn't true.Lincoln, in fact, trashed the Constitution -- among other things, closing down newspapers and jailing their editors without trial just because they happened to disagree with him politically.As for Lincoln's ""freeing the slaves,"" Lincoln's Secretary of State Seward said it all when he referred to the Emancipation Proclamation as ""emancipating the slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free."" i.e. keeping slavery legal in the North but used as a hollow ploy to keep Britain from helping the South secede, which was their Constitutional right to do.Only 6 percent of Southerners owned slaves and General Lee, among many other Southerners, abhored slavery -- but he fought the North because the war was about States' rights to secede, not about slavery at all, as the court historians such as Burns would have us believe.But, as I said, it's a very well-done fiction for those who don't know the real Lincoln."
1,poor,"I ordered this for a birthday gift for my daughter in law who is a history major. I Just now got around to watching it, and it is corrupted. I wasted my money. I will not purchase from this person again."
3,PBS THE CIVIL WAR,"VERY GOOD DVD, MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT CERTAIN EXTRA'S, SUCH AS HOW THE THEME SONG WAS PLAYED BY THE MAN AND WOMAN ON A VIOLIN AND GUITAR WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE 5 DISCS, ALL IN ALL THOUGH FOR A CIVIL WAR BUFF IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS."
5,british version i believe is longer,"the british version which is a PAL region 2 dvd is 690 minutes long according to uk amazon website with 3 DVDs in a boxset, and according to USA amazon the US version is only 660 minutes long. also i believe at time of writing this review the british version is also cheper if obtained via amazon.co.uk at about i think $64 to $68 though this will change as intrest dollar to pound rates change over time. please rember if buying uk dvd version that your dvd player MUST BE a multi region dvd player to play UK region 2 PAL dvds! hope this helps some one"
5,You'd have to hate history a whole lot... not to love this,"Burns takes cold facts and gives them human warmth. He takes stiff-looking b&w pictures of men in their long beards... long dead... and brings a light of personality to them. It's more than just the numbers and the maps... it's the human side of it. There is a wonderful familiarity across time to the outakes of letters and quotes. We realize that these people were very much like ourselves, yet thrown into another window of opportunity and time on earth.The main reason, though, I feel that this documentary is so powerful is because not only was it glorious for the already-converted CIVIL WAR buffs... but it converted the non-converted... and THAT is the best one could hope for from a film of this nature.Thank you Mr. Burns (""Ken""... not ""Montgomery"")"
5,Great series,This is an epic mini series. I think it is one of Ken's best works. I felt the series really brought to life the tragic episode in this young America. The foot soldiers almost speak directly to you. It is amazing to look back and watch history unfold in such a vivid and accurate account. Ken Burns is the Master!
1,Missing Almost Everything,"Product would be great except the description stated that the product included:Interview with Ken BurnsAdditional Interviews: George Will, Stanley Crouch, Shelby Foote and Jay Ungar & Molly MasonCommentary by Ken BurnsBiography CardsBattlefield MapsCivil War ChallengeProduct DescriptionKen Burns' Emmy Award-winning documentary brings to life America's most destructive - and defining - conflict. The Civil War is the saga of celebrated generals and ordinary soldiers, a heroic and transcendent president and a country that had to divide itself in two in order to become one. The 150th Anniversary Six Disc DVD set includes never-before-seen special features including new interview with Ken Burns, Shelby Foote interview outtakes, and a bonus 16-page collector's booklet featuring a selection of photos and battle details.We got 6 DVDs, no book, no maps, no biography cards, etc... Disappointed..."
4,Adult Civil War,"The Civil War by Ken Burns is an excellent depiction of the many facets of war and it's effects. However, it should perhaps be marked 'for adults only'. It shows all too well what the civil war REALLY did and stands as an excellent reminder that war should NEVER be glorified because no matter what the reason, the cost comes with much human suffering."
1,Ken Burns Civil War,2 of the 5 discs did not play. I was very dissapointed because I really wanted to watch the series and hoped to watch it. I talked with my brother and he had a similar experience too.
5,Great gift for the Civil War lover,Bought this as a gift for my Husband for Fathers Day....he absolutely loves it. A very informative series at a wonderful price. I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the Civil War..you just cant go wrong.So happy to have found it here on Amazon : ) Many thanks!!
5,the Civil War absorbed,"Of course, we all learned about the Civil War in school, but how much of it meant anything? Now, I have the time and interest to learn about the Civil War and do more research. Ken Burns' film is a montage of still photographs that are extremely sensitive to the casualties of war. That any of these photos were ever taken with the crude equipment under difficult circumstances is remarkable. War photographers can bring aspects of war that no tale can tell. I find this DVD set absolutely riveting, and fair. I am enchanted by the dialogue with Mr. Shelby Foote. Something every American should watch and absorb. War is hell."
4,Great documentary,Can't go wrong with a Ken Burns film! Well produced. I've owned it before but gave it to my daughter. I wanted another one.
5,The Civil War-A Film By Ken Burns,"I can't say enough good things about this film! What Burns has created is nothing less than a documentary masterpiece. I personally have seen this entire film at least five times and I learn and see new things with each viewing.It is a feast for the eyes as well as the ears. The entire film is filled with vintage photographs, Civil War era music, superb narration and the insights of those who lived through the war themselves.I have noticed a few minor factual errors in the film (i.e., Lincoln was 56 when he died, not 54), but they are few and certainly do not take away from the impact of this magnificent work.This one is definitely worth the money. I can recommend it without reservation."
5,Worth the hunt finding,"The chapters deal with a specific aspect of sex in movies, and the author has dug deep to pull out some great and obscure movies. The book is richly endowed with many black and white pictures of memorable scenes and stars. Material is presented from the first on film kiss up to the free-for-all sex romps of the 70's. Very entertaining and the pictorial content alone is worth it."
3,She says it is not the same as the department store bottle,I bought this as a gift & did not want to pay department store prices. She says it does not last as long & does not smell exactly the same.
2,"Some good information, but otherwise misses the boat","This book provides some useful content in explaining various developmental issues, however if it were not for that, I would have given it a mimimum rating. This book is really about dealing with ""autistic spectrum children"" and what disturbs me the most is that the well-educated authors dismiss the dramatic rise in autism coinciding with the increased use Thimerosal laced childhood vaccines beginning in the early 90's. (Just do a google search on ""Thimerosal"" if you don't know what I'm talking about, or ""Dave Weldon Autism"" if you think this is on the fringe). In fact, the authors suggest that the increased use of vaccines has allowed us to spend more time dealing with development issues that were formerly undiagnosed - how dare they suggest that when there is an undisputed autism epidemic in this country acknowledged by the mainstream medical community? If you are an adult, how many autistic kids did you know as a child?"
5,A great resource for parents and educators.,"Quirky Kids is a wonderful reference for parents. It offers excellent insights into the evaluatiion of specialists, diagnoses and therapies for children. The solid advice about how to approach your child's school, how to deal with the extended family, and how to live daily life with a harder-than-usual kid were most helpful to me.I was reassured by the authors' understanding and appreciation of ""special"" children and their behaviors. Drs. Klass and Costello have obvious compassion for and insight into the issues facing families with quirky kids!"
4,Quirky kids,"My child was labeled ""Quirky"" by a teacher when he was 5 yrs old. When I can across this title, I had to read it. It gave me so many answers, and described my son exactly. It taught me that you don't have to have an ADHD or Autism label in order to be struggling with the many symptoms that fall under either category. It validated my worries as a mother. A must read for parents wondering what's wrong with my child? Thumbs up."
5,excellent,"a great book for parents of borderline, functional quirky kids. it focuses on the possibilities and not labels."
5,#1 book for parents with 'quirky kids' :-),When my 4 year old was diagnosed with aspergers I felt lost. My son's doctor had a son that has autism. He recommended this book to me. I am so glad he did! It gave me so much hope for my son. It taught me how to understand him and how his mind works. It helped me to know how to explain to other people what is going on with him. Most of all it helped me to explain things to my son as he experiences them. I very much highly recommend this book for any parent struggling with a child that is just a bit 'quirky'.
5,A Worthwhile Book,This is a great book. I would highly suggest it to any parent of a child with autism or asperger's. Very good sections on both elementary school issues and chapters on post elementary school issues also--not just pure educational issues but a strong discussion on social issues as well.
3,A Book for Those Who Have Read Nothing Else,"This book is more of a description of quirky kids and the problems they may face rather than a source of information about how to address these issues. If you are looking for validation for your concerns and some ideas as to the challenges you may face, this is a decent introduction. But if you are anywhere beyond the introductory level, this book will likely disappoint you."
2,STOP! Don't Get This Book!!,"As I was looking through the pages of this book, it had absolutely nothing to do with ramp building. It taught you nothing, described nothing, and worse of all, it didn't even had detailed instructions. Please listen to me, and do not buy this ramp building book, it is a waste of money, and a waste of your time."
3,Awesome (at first),"I purchased the DWL-900AP+ with a DWL-650+ (Cardbus Adapter) to set up a wireless network using my desktop computer as the gateway. I had very little trouble setting this up, and it was my first attempt at networking. Installation/setup was quick and easy, and the range was outstanding (I got 90% signal strength with my laptop located a floor above the access point.Twenty-four hours after setup, the cardbus adapter crashed and would not power up. The wireless connection established between the access point and my Sony Clie WLAN card was VERY slow. I plan to set my nework up again with different equipment in hopes of having better results.In all fairness, the D-Link access point was good (in and of itself) for normal wireless networking."
2,"OK As Access Point, DOES NOT work as a Repeater as Claimed","After 6 phone calls to D-Link tech support, I have determined that this product will not work in a repeater mode as claimed. They could not make it work. Works fine as an access point."
3,Headache,"This product seems to work in client mode with my Linksys 802.11b access point. However, it does not work with my Philips MC-i200 Streamium stereo and I'm finding out that the stereo does not work with any D-Link ethernet product. The stereo works perfectly fine with my Linksys router, so there obviously is a compatibility issue with D-Link's firmware.Tech support as usual is hours of hold time and they really are of no help; they basically regurgitate what is on their website, and then eventually leave you with the statement, ""just return the product"". Certainly doesn't sound like a company that would like to fix problems."
1,D-Link AirPlus DWL-900AP+,"I received the product crammed in a priority mail envelope and was taped by the seller to hold it shut. The packaging was badley crushed and the D-Link was broken on one corner of the case. I contacted the seller. The seller responded promptly and agree to return my money along with the return shipping cost. The seller was very sorry and saying it was all they fault for the packing they used. I did get a refund for the product and the original shipping cost, but not for the $11.05 return shipping cost back to them, which I packaged the right way. Because of the bad packaging and the time delay for our customer who needed this part and not getting the return shipping refund, I would not buy from this seller again."
1,un altro giorno con me,"chiedo di avere informazioni in ITALIANO riguardo il cd ""un altro giorno con me""GRAZIEWRITE MA SOON"
2,confussing and not very helpful,"i don't know how anyone with no accounting experience will understand this booki am a college student. i have always been good with numbers; but, i have no prior knowledge of accounting.i checked this book out from my local library and i am returning it early to find something easier to understand.there are many terms thrown at you with no examples to guide you.there is good reason this book is only a penny plus shipping"
5,Adventures in the Land of Music...,I had forgotten about this group - that was my fault! They were an excellent R&B/Dance group who gave the consumer max value for their dollar. Standout songs: I've just begun to love you and Adventures in the land of music (sampled to death!). I paid $14/US for my disc! My rating for the disc: Five stars!
3,"Oh, Well","If you are looking for a CD that captures the real Dynasty, then this is the one for you. All of their hits are here. The album and live versions of ""I've Just Begun to Love You"" is here. Believe it or not, the title song, ""Adventures in the Land of Music"", has been sampled, like most songs during the R&B/Dance Era, by a rap group. This particular song is an awesome song and is very dynamic in it's horn arrangements. Some songs on here are fair to middlin', but only if you can appreciate Dynasty's approach to the R&B mixed with Dance ERA."
4,They work fine,"Pretty good price for a set of angle blocks. I can't vouch for the accuracy of each one, but they have performed for me a required and expected. I would definitely recommend them to someone who needs a general purpose set in a good (plastic) case."
5,"Irreverant, helpful and a laugh-a-minute","From the tip of the coast to the more rancid parts of Los Angeles, these authors capture the essence of California's life style. I chuckled when reading the description of Venice Beach; I wish I could write as wittily as this!"
2,"broad overviews are entertaining, not a reliable source","As a local SoCal surfer, I found this book disappointing. The authors chose wit over accuracy. Although the book is a more interesting read than most guidebooks, it feels like it was written BY a tourist, not just FOR the tourists. It falls victim to tiresome cliches as though it were written purely from hearsay accounts of the locations, and not real experience. In addition - and I know surfing was not the main purpose of this book - the information regarding the surf conditions of the california beaches was also inaccurate and skimpy. Not very useful overall."
1,Stay away from this machine,"I ordered one for Christmas. It arrived and would not prime. I called the hotline and was told the send it back. I did, the new one arrived and this one was worse than the other one. I found a bolt in the bean hopper and it leaked water from the bottom, it too would not prime. Called again and was told the same thing. There is obviously NO quality control even though there is a card that comes with the machine stating it is checked. I bought a Jura instead."
1,I'm extremely disappointed.,"I've spend over $ 400.00 and I'm extremely disappointed. The coffee machine doesn't work correctly. Now is completely broken, I was sent it too Saeco service .... and I'm still waiting....Dorota"
2,I'll never see it ...,For no one that has a Region 1 DVD player only -- this is Region 2 and will not play. Goes against Amazon's desire for Region 1 play OR advertised otherwise. This is not advertised as such ...
3,Good deal,"It works well out of the box. It's supposedly able to fly to the moon and back, but the trick is that you have to have a degree from MIT to tell it to do that, so for most of us thats not a feature you will be able to use.. Out of the box it is handling 2 lines and 3 phones at this time for me, it works well. I'm thankful I don't really need any of the other features, because I don't think I could conjuer them, you know, with my ""limited"" education..:D"
2,very good product but no tech support,"it works very good as expected but if you ever need some basic tech help or simple questions, there is nobody to contact. I got this product on time and was able to set it up for basic functions but when contacted seller thru amazon.com, I got phone number to call.when I called that number got hang up twice and finally they told me to contact at some number for local panasonic dealer and they charge 90$ an hours, minimum 1 hour."
3,Good but less durable than Dunlop Tortex,"Good guitar picks, however they wear out too fast.I stopped using them."
5,Inspirational book,"This was a really good autobiography about Heather Whitestone, former Miss America. She talks about her struggles as a deaf person and her experience as Miss America, and how God has worked in her life.I really enjoyed her book. I like how she was so open about her struggles with a deaf person. She didn't feel like she fit into the deaf world or the hearing world. Yet, she continues to persevere, and with God's help, she overcomes her obstacles to become Miss America. And she is open with her struggles as Miss America, too. She talks about the need for privacy and her struggles with criticism from the press.A great, inspirational book."
5,An outstanding book well worth the money and more!,"Beautiful book, gorgeous, well printed, a work of art."
3,costume history,"i ordered this book because i really liked the artwork. Pros: the book is fairly large and has many detailed illustrations almost in every page.Cons: first of all, each plate has a description underneath or on the adjacent page. They are written in 3 languages which might or might not be useful. The text size of the description are VERY small, about 1/3 the size of normal reading text, so it is very hard to read. Another thing is that there is alot of white space on the pages where the text is, and also on the borders of the plates. With such detailed art i would have liked them to be a bit larger, and i would have liked the text to be larger since the books has plenty of space for it.There is a 1st edition complete version of this book but it is more expensive and maybe that one is different."
1,Disappointed,"Would have liked to review this product, unfortunately the company suddenly cancelled the order I'd placed several days earlier saying they were out of stock. This is now 4 days before Christmas and this was ordered as a gift (thus the gift box) so now there is no way to find a replacement gift for my parents that will arrive by the holiday. They shouldn't just keep accepting orders if they have no ability to fulfill them. Very disappointing experience."
5,Saulo Does it Again,"This is a great follow on to Saulo's 1st set and this in conjunction with his no-gi set really gives you a good overall game.Definately the highlight of this set is the takedown disc, well worth the price of the whole set!"
2,Not what I expected.,"If you want to just hear the songs, it's passable. BUT even an ""undiscerning ear"" can hear this is NOT the London Philharmoic, and not John Williams conducting. So many of the peices are rushed, and just sound ""off"" The Prauge Philharmonic just didn't to Mr. Williams work justice."
3,Fast Shipping But Cracked Case,"Appreciated the fast shipping, but the CD cover was cracked in two different areas. This is a gift so I was sure to purchase a ""like new"" item... either the description wasn't honest, or the item was damaged when shipped. Ug."
4,John Williams CD Review,"The CD case was a little damaged, but I think that was due to the shipping process. And one disc had a tiny scratch, but everything worked."
2,Can't compare to the originals,"While this 4-CD set does offer one of the most comprehensive collections of film music by the 20th century's greatest composer, I was very disappointed that they didn't have Williams himself conduct, or use original tracks from the movie scores. [...]"
1,Very disappointing,"While I'm as big a fan of John Williams' music as anyone, I was *highly* disappointed by this collection for one simple fact--the quality of the orchestra playing his scores here is simply appalling. For those used to hearing Mr. Williams' music being played by only the finest of ensembles, this recording will be an extreme let-down. I was especially looking forward to this recording for its concert arrangements of songs such as ""Flag Parade"" that are unavailable elsewhere ... but I can't even bring myself to listen to it, the musicianship is so poor. My advice: skip this over-priced, substandard recording and stick with the original, official soundtracks."
2,This is NOT soundtrack music as advertized!,"The music on this album is a mixture of re-recordings that possibly are from the original musical scores of their respective movies, but the music most definitely is NOT the soundtrack music of the respective movies as Amazon advertises. There can be one and only one musical soundtrack for a movie and the music from this album is admittedly re-recordings. If you want to buy the original soundtrack music for each of the described movies, this album does not have any of it. Come on Amazon, get your act together!"
3,"Great pattern, poor quality","When I bought this bed set at Toys R Us, I was so happy about the print that I didn't think of looking at the fabric. 70% POLYESTER, 30% COTTON: this makes the bed set quite rough to the touch, and doesn't encourage the use of sheets in a two year old that doesn't like sleeping with anything over him.The ""comforter"" is better used as an occasional rug, rather than for sleeping. Plus, I was missing the pillow case, but I think I was just unlucky...So, considering how my son just loves Spiderman, I rate it three, but I would really love to find an equivalent 100 % Cotton."
2,"Rough, Rough","I agree with the previous review. The print was so cute, I didn't notice the poor quality of the material. Not recommended for naps.... only decorative."
1,complete waste of money,i bought this for my son who loves spiderman.. he slept on it one night and never wanted to sleep on it again. it is so rough that it can almost be used as a pot scrub. it was a complete waste of money.
3,Overpriced!,"I was shocked when I saw the price of this. Believe me, this is way overpriced! I live in a part of the country that has a large Amish population, and I have yet to see a price this high for just a lazy susan."
4,Nice & Light Weight,Great buy! 100 percent cotton so it will shrink to to size. If you need a large XL to not buy
2,Not sure...,The scent has changed from a couple years ago when I first bought it. Why can't companies keep a good thing?
3,Faint Fragrance,"Love the fragrance, but it is so light it is almost non-existant. Would not purchase this product again. Would like a slightly stronger fragrance."
3,Hopeful? Not exactly.,"Contrary to the critics' reviews, I didn't find this to be an ultimately hopeful collection of stories and did not find myself sympathizing with the characters at all. The short stories are certainly entertaining and often witty; many of them are page-turners and the writing is sharp and punchy. But the stories themselves are pretty grim. This is not a book you walk away from feeling all warm and fuzzy - which is ordinarily fine. If you a single woman looking for a beacon of hope, look elsewhere."
1,Disappointing,"I really expected to like this book. While the stories are certainly witty and the humor dark, I found the underlying anger and bitterness of every character too much to take. None of the characters seems to be able to relate to society very well, and while that can sometimes make for an interesting read (think the Bell Jar, or even Catcher in the Rye), these characters just seemed pathetic to me. I found them all to be bitter and defensive and I was totally unable to relate or even empathize with them. I was not expecting saccharine, happy Hollywood-type endings to these stories (that may have been even worse) but the only emotion this book evoked for me was annoyance."
2,disappointing,"It's always a bad sign if a writer can't even come up with an original title. Krouse goes through the motions of addressing current ""women's issues"" like infertility, marriage, codependency, blah blah blah without any new insights. Her writing style is awkward and she fails to create any memorable characters. this book is not only ineptly written but depressing as hell. If Mae West were alive, she'd would punch Erika Krouse in the stomach for maligning her name. Krouse is nowhere near as ballsy, witty or perceptive as West. Citing famous Mae West one-liners as ""inspiration"" Krouse shows herself to be sadly lacking in comparison."
2,Not enough material,"I used the first few pages for a boys' group I facilitated. However, I was disappointed with the lack of activities and information in the book. I went through the entire book in one session."
5,Preschool Prep Products are amazing!,"I 1st bought their letters, shapes, colors, numbers, and sight words DVD's, board books, and apps. My son fell in love with the DVD's at 6 months old. He's now 18 months, and knows his ABC's, numbers, shapes, colors, and sight words. Other parents are amazed at how smart he is, and ask me how he knows all of this already. Preschool Prep is amazing, and I highly recommend these products. As soon as I heard they now have these Phonics DVD's I had to buy them. It's only been a couple weeks that he started watching these, but I'm confident he will learn a lot from them."
4,Quite Fun For Kids,"If you like Meet the Letters and the other shows from this company, you will like this. They are a pretty fun way for the kids to learn blends and stuff like that."
4,Good Buy,"My 30 yr old Craftsman 3/8"" drill fitted with a chuck from another Mfg. drill I gutted, finally expired. I purchased the Dewalt 6Amp 3/8"" to replace it and love that drill for heavy drilling duty. The only problem with the Dewalt is that the trigger will not lock down for sanding/buffing. So, I purchased this B&D drill & I'm very satisfied with it's operation. It's holding up well to rust grinding and wax buffing. For the price, I think it's a great deal."
1,"Plenty of power, chuck is junk","I will let the other reviewers tell about it's power. The chuck will not hold a drill bit no matter how hard you tighten it. It will slip and leave the bit stuck in whatever you are drilling. Every time. It's like B&D took an old key chuck and put plastic grips on it. I would rather have a key chuck. It will hold onto hex drivers if they're bottomed out in the chuck. If they're not bottomed out, they will slip once you put pressure on it. And like another reviewer noted, the chuck gets stuck and you just about have to use Channel locks to get a hex nut driver out after using it. If you use this as either a drill or a driver it may make you very angry."
1,Another chucking failure,"I don't have a lot of time to work on home improvement projects, so when a free weekend rolls around, I would like for my tools to work. After a series of frustrations with cordless drills (battery never charged when I need to use it) I bought this corded drill. The first project I worked on was hanging curtain rods. When I tried to drive a screw into wood (after drilling a pilot hole), the chuck froze up and wouldn't turn to release the bit. After wrestling the bit free, the chuck still wouldn't open or close.I returned that particular drill, and like a moron, got another of the same model. Same project, same wood, same screw, same problem - the chuck just froze up and wouldn't turn one way or another. I'm done with this drill - it might work for driving screws into butter, but the chuck breaks if you try to do any serious work."
3,Low price = you get what you pay for,"I bought this based on its low price but I had to return it immediately because of a problem with the chuck. I bought a comparable corded 3/8 inch drill of the DeWalt line (D21008K) instead-- more expensive but clearly money better spent, in retrospect.As an example, look at the chuck's outer rings (where I had a problem): it is made out of plastic. The DeWalt version is aluminum there, feels more mechanically rock solid, and it is thoughtfully larger in diameter (so you can clamp/unclamp with a higher gripping torque). (The DeWalt has a higher rated power-- but I'm just comparing how trustworthy the designs are.)At about $30 for this Black and Decker I think you get what you pay for-- it otherwise looked fine, and I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt for the rest.(By the way, this one of my very rare product return experience with Amazon, and I applaud how painless they make that, even with a non-media item like this!)"
1,Chuck is useless,"I bought this for drilling in aluminum. The keyless chuck can't be tightened enough to keep the drill bit from slipping, no matter how hard I try. I wanted an inexpensive corded drill, but this is not functional. Perhaps it would be ok for drilling very soft materials."
1,STUPID CHUCK - DO NOT BUY!!!,"SHAME on you Black & Decker.The chuck on this drill/driver make the unit totally worthless. It comes with a bit for driving or removing phillips and slotted screws, but the chuck opens when trying to remove a screw.The chuck does not tighten enough to hold a drill either. The drill bit slips easily.It has no torque adjustment.It does not have a low speed switch for driving screws.I have only used this unit about five times.It went to the landfill today, no recycle, no garage sale, just straight to the LANDFILL.Black & Decker has been added to my ""NEVER BUY"" list.STOP MAKING THIS UNIT Black and Decker!!!!"
1,Cheap plastic housing,"I purchased this drill over a year ago. This weekend it finally failed. I was using a hole saw which causes a lot of resistance between the drill and the motor. The plastic housing allowed the gearing to dig deep into the plastic making it disengage from the drill shaft gear. The gears are not stripped, the teeth simply do not mesh any more. I will never purchase a drill with a plastic housing again."
1,Chuck does not work!,"May be I got a defective product? Not sure why other people give this drill a high rating. For me the chunk just won't able secure any round drill bit no matter how hard I do it. As logn as I start drilling, the drill bit will lose from the chunk and stucked in the pieces. I want it works so bad, overall the drill is high quality, powerful and inexpensive, but the chunk cannot secure a drill bit then that useless for me!"
4,Chuck = Suck,"I concur with most of the other reviews which tend to be positive. I just wanted to reiterate that the chuck on this drill absolutely sucks. Putting any pressure on the drill causes the bit to slip. Overall a nice drill, but if you actually want to bore a hole, plan on spending another $20 on a decent chuck. The Jacobs Model #: 30354MP works nicely"
1,worthless chuck ona decent drill,"lst use, io minutes inserting small screws for hanging small window blinds OK----2nd use same project i minute into work bit stayed in screw and chuck froze; cannot tighten or loosen. . CUST SERV ADVISED ME TO RETURN DRILLABSOLUTE JUNK."
3,Probably ok.,"I bought this drill from a local store, and well it may perform fine as a screwdriver using a hex bit, hand tightening an actual drill bit proved very difficult. Perhaps I got a messed up version, but I had a hard time hand tightening bits.I have used other hand tightening drills in the past, and never had this issue. Other than that, it performed as expected."
1,Good if it wasn't for the chuck,"I don't care how powerful it is! A drill is useless if the chuck doesn't work properly and I will tell you that I've had THREE of these drills because I keep returning them due to the keyless chuck getting stuck and I just keep getting disappointed with this product.I'll admit the first time I thought it was me because it broke so quickly but the second time it broke just as fast (within in the first or second time of using it)and here's the kicker, the third time I returned it and got a new drill the keyless chuck was broken RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!If you were smarter than me and did some research before you spent the money save yourself some time and frustration and get completely different drill and thank me later when it lasts more then a few days."
5,B&D Drill Review,"I have only used my new drill a couple of times, but am impressed with it. The tool balance is good. It has plenty of power and speed control seems to be spread over a reasonable range of trigger movement. I didn't think I would like the canvass bag versus a hard case, but now find it lets me store the drill in smaller spaces.Overall, I would rate this drill as an excellent buy for the money."
4,Bearing locknut socket,"The ""fingers"" that engage the lock nut are a bit short and narrow (perhaps to acommodate such a wide range of vehicles?). The socket tends to slip out of position easily while applying the torque called for. I think a socket with a ""skirt"" out board of the ""fingers"" might be easier to use."
5,One nice knife,"This has to be the best knife I've owned. opens fast and hard feels like it could fly right out of your hand when opening it. the blade is razor sharp right for the factory. it holds its edge really good too. If you are looking for a all around every day carry knife you cant go wrong with this knife, plus it comes with a life time warranty that sog will honer. this is my second sog I also have a twitch xl thy are both awesome knives."
2,Good blade on a poor handle,"I really wanted to like this knife. The steel is fantastic and takes a good edge. I can slice paper into ribbons, cut corrugated boxes with ease, slice steel banding on pallets, whittle hardwoods, etc. Unfortunately, the mechanism is subpar. The knife opens easily but is very difficult to close. SOG has tried to emulate Benchmade's Axis lock and failed miserably. Also, when I tried to switch the clip for left handed use, the screw broke off at the head! I fixed it with super glue, but that doesn't exactly inspire confidence. The safety is stupid, as the knife will never accidentally open. I glued it unlocked with super glue as well. All in all an ok knife that would benefit from a better handle."
5,"Great knife, super sharp",This is a great knife that came super sharp and opens lightning fast. It is light so carrying it in your pocket is a snap. That pocket clip is super strong and tight and holds it in place firmly. My only drawback is the handles. I have very large hands and the handling of this knife was a little weird the first day but I quickly got used to it and am comfortable with it now.
4,Excellent knife for the money.,"I got my Flash ii today. This is the third SOG I have owned, and I really like it. At first I wasn't thrilled with the handle, it felt a little flimsy, but I think it is just different than what I am used to because I have been EDCing a stainless steel handled Spyderco lately. I highly recommend this knife, it is very stabby."
4,SOG Flash 2,This knife holds and edge very well and the blade shape is great for every day use. I would give this product 4 of 5 stars.
4,"A fun knife, but a pretty good one.","It's not the best or most practical knife in its class and price range. If I were out in the middle of the wilderness I might bring another knife. But for everyday use this is a nice, fun, and pretty good knife. It's lightweight (people that criticize the handle are being silly I think), has a big blade with a great shape and grind, decent steel, comes sharp, and the assisted opening is fun. I'd say this is a little bit more of a fun knife, but still very practical even if it isn't the most down-to-business."
5,as expected from SOG,this is my 2nd one since i gave my first one to my old man to carry with him at work. he loved it so much that i couldn't take it back from him. this was a good price as well since i payed a bit more for my first one.
1,Broke! Junk knife!!,"I owned this knife for less than 6 months, never abused and it BROKE. The opening pin literally snapped from the metal so now the knife won't close.. i opened it less than 500 times.. GARBAGE. Never will buy SOG again."
3,OK,"Pros:Light weight.Conceals perfectly in a pocket with its great clip.(however, be gentle with the clip)Nice blade.Opens quickly and easily.Cons:Up and down play of blade. Makes me suspicious of the lockup. Avoid oiling the pivot, that might worsen the play.Expensive.Recommendations:Get an Ontario Rat 1. Better knife and at a cheaper price to boot."
4,Great for Interested Ballerina's,"It's a great book for girls very interested in Ballet. My daughter loves it. I gives the correct french names of positions and the pictures are large enough to make colouring stand out. its a beautiful book,especially when it's almost full of colour!"
2,Only for those who are interested in studying ballet,"I suppose I should have realized from the title that this is not a typical coloring book.It had very few pictures in it that were of any interest to me in coloring, as the majority of pictures were of a child illustrating the various moves and positions in learning ballet.I would have been interested if the book had featured dancers performing a scene from a ballet. There are only two or three pictures like that in the book.It probably would be a good supplement for a teacher or student of ballet. It is well-illustrated for that purpose, but as an interesting coloring book, no."
3,sort of disappointed,"i thought the pictures to color would be more like the cover, it ended up being more of a how to ballet book with far too much writing for my granddaughter."
3,Misleading picture!,"Just for anyone considering this product, keep in mind you'll get a SINGLE towel, not like the picture is showing 3 towels. I thought there is some mistake when I opened the package, but as I see on this page it says ""TOWEL"" not ""TOWELS"".The towel is just ok, the picture is misleading."
3,An intriguing world,"Gail Dayton continues her story began in ""The Compass Rose,"" of Major Kallista Varyl, now a mother of twins and head of a large family or 'ilian.' She is also a 'naitan,' or wielder of magic, in a world where rebel forces assisted by demons are threatening world order. I was less intrigued by the major plot events involving this threat than I was by the unusual social organization and concept of family introduced by the author. Not as good as the first, but worth a read."
4,The other family members,This book is good at letting you know about what happen with other family members from the Fortunes of Texas. It has it's owm mystery going on that kept the other one alive and going.
3,Fuzzies,"Is this a reprinted copy? This book that I received was ""too perfect"" to be a book that was printed in 1971 as labeled as a First Edition. The paper on back board of the book was not glued to the board. Is this a common practice? Has this been done before? I plan to keep the book, but will not use this seller again."
4,Fun,"Need a little D&D; fix but no one to play with? This book will help.The best thing is it's small and easy to carry with no parts to lose. Bring it to Grandma's, or on that stupid camping trip.You can use an already made character or make your own.Battle monsters, figure out traps, and find the warlock's therasure.Try it it's fun!"
3,I expected a little more,I bought this just to try it but I was little disappointed. I'd rather read an actual fiction book to tell the truth but that's obviously my opinion. Good for D&D fans
4,Simply the best,"I have been using Everpure for decades. They are expensive but worth every penny. The neat, foolproof mounting bracket tucks away under your sink and makes changing filters a breeze. I have mine set to feed a dedicated drinking water tap and my refrigerator's icemaker. Supplying all drinking water and ice for two of us, the H-104 easily keeps our water clean for a year. I replace it on that interval so that I don't forget. Here SoFla the Everpure system has taken us from Chlorine purified to Ammonia purified and back again. Ammonia purified water is often yellow, but not with the H-104. This filter is good for around 1000 gallonsThe difference in water quality is simply amazing; no color, no smell, chemical tastes. Just pure, clean water.If you like coffee...you need filtered water.If you live in areas with special needs or contaminants, Everpure makes specialized filters.[...]"
5,everpure h-104 replacement cartridges,This was a great price for the product and it was shipped in lightening speed! I will be a repeat customer.
5,"easy to use, install","I got this filter as a replacement for one that was in a townhouse i bought (and which hadn't been changed in SIX years). But it still went into the filter housing with no problem (despite my concerns that maybe the old cartridge would be stuck/corroded, but i didn't have any issues as it turned out). After running a bit of water to get the filter primed, some calcium worked its way out of the system and my water now appears to be pretty clean/filtered. Easy to install, good instructions, and good support with followup questions i had from the vendor, so i'm pretty happy with it."
5,Everpure filter replacement cartridge,Have been using the Everpure water filtering system for 10 years. The system is very good and the replacement cartridges easy to remove and re-install
1,So far not good,"Just wondering when the water will come out clear -- after many gallons, still cloudy and soft and off-tasting. Does anyone have a good experience with this filter?"
2,not a perfect match,"The part looked identical to the one I was replacing.But it was incredibly difficult to install because the rubber seal made the fit too tight.I sanded it down quite a bit but it was still difficult to put in.Now the handle is too tight to turn so I left it on ""shower""."
5,another classic gem,"the second release of the band to date. this album was originally released back in 1981 summer by solar records. 'tuff', 'hold out', 'I've been watching you', 'I got what you need' and the title track are synth-based jams can easily burn up the dancefloor in a minute. slow jams are pleasant too especially 'I wont let you be lonely' is my favourite. you can get the feeling of groove all the way down as you listen to this album. the cover photo of the band with oriental-über-space boogie-ish outwears is nice and stylish also. a must have."
5,BACK IN THE DAY,"Now here I go again , West coast don't you know soul when you here it ? THESE BOYS AND GIRLS ARE HOT!!!! you get styles of the whipers , one way remember them ,slave . Great vocals ,you better go back and check it. I won't let you be lonely , whose gonna sing that these days .USHER,TWISTA,BEYOUNCE,nope ain't happening.buy this and get your r&b fix.Maybe then there won't be no parking on the dance floor. my favorite saying is play the funk not the junk .ciao till next time"
2,Rev. J's Review,This was not one of the best of Helen Baylor. I loved her earlier works but the arrangments on this product where not there.
2,Interesting ... but lackluster,"In the vein of ""contemporary gay fiction"" I must say that there are many other books worth buying before this one. The fairytale quality of the plot is cute at best, but the dialogues ... are pretty awful. Everything about this book pointed to the eventual deception that I felt, so I suppose it was not that surprising. If you have a long flight (and you count on sleeping a little, but not too much...) this is a perfect choice."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad","This book is about David, a 32 year old gay guy in NYC thats life has stalled out in recent years. Then there is John, seemingly unrelated to the main story, who is raised by his drunk of a granny and grows up a social outcast. The book is pretty entertaining, but I didn't find a lot of the parts you're supposed to laugh at very funny. I could have done without all the little ""Off the List"" columns inserted throughout (I think the ending would've worked fine without them). Overall it was a pretty good read but ultimately forgetable."
5,like watching an episode of 30 Rock!,"Seriously. There are so many throw away jokes in Blind Items that I had to slow down to catch up with them. There is enough wit and hilarity on page...i don't know...say, 62, alone to fill a sassy comedian's sketch book. Humor aside, and not being a huge fan of pop culture gossip, this book has a lot more to offer and disguises it in a seemingly superficial wrapper. It may be dated in the pre-Perez era, but Rettenmund's way with words keeps it endlessly fresh and engaging. The two storylines (closeted actor and silent film freak) are both so equally engrossing that the twist connecting them at the end came as a surprise. I know Matt has a successful blog (Boy Culture) to maintain, but I can't wait for him to write another book!"
4,Should have been longer. . .,"Althought I am not a gay man (I'm a straight woman), I really enjoyed Matt's first novel, ""Boy Culture,"" and was almost giddy when I began to read his second book. I found myself a little bit disappointed with the beginning of the novel--the writing was a little bit confusing and hard to follow, but once I got past the first fifty pages or so, it was great. The sub-plot of John Dewey is intriuging, espeically when one finds out at the end who he's become. Also, Matt's pop culture references (he mentions everyone from Stephen King to Kevin Spacey) are hilarious, as well as priceless. Pick this book up, no matter if you are gay or straight. If nothing else it may help one to understand the nuances of gay life a bit better."
3,Okay book... good for a rainy day...,"Let's face it, Rettenmund isn't going to win a Pullitzer prize for ""Blind Items"" anytime soon, but it was a cute little story that's good for one of those rainy days, or slow afternoons. The novel is full of campy fun, hilarious little quips here and there, and Rettenmund has an awesome eye for kitsch and oldies culture (sorry dolls, I'm a 19 year old who really didn't get a bunch of the Jon-Erik Hexum, and other dated jokes... not my generation.) I loved reading this novel, great to read to while away the hours."
2,Loose Writing Style makes this a boring read,"Blind Items has the same writing style as at least one of Rettenmund's other books (Boy Culture). He goes on for pages and pages to describe something that could have been said in two paragraphs. Kind of reminds me of the articles you read in the Sunday magazine section of your newspaper. If you like this writing style, Rettenmund's books may be for you. Personally it drove me crazy and I set the book down after the first few chapters."
4,For those who enjoy realistic construction vehicles!,"My 3ds received this for his birthday and likes it. It is realistic and BIG. He has a whole construction company in our family room and enjoys pretending he's building things. Until now, he did not have a cement mixer so this fit the bill. As with the other toys made by this company, the plastic is very thin and if played with too roughly, will break. NOT an outside toy IMO."
3,Disappointing,"My son received this as a gift for Christmas after he played with some Bruder trucks at a friends house. I'm so disappointed in it! It's basically a plastic truck, nothing special and most certainly doesn't seem any more durable than a $15 truck I can get at Toys R Us. My son LOVES big trucks and he barely bats an eye at this one. Most definitely NOT what I expected for such an expensive toy."
5,"beep, beep, here comes the cement truck","We bought this cement truck for our grandson who is two years old. For two weeks, he played with little else, even taking it to bed with him. My daughter says it is holding up well to the onslaught of fundom her son is putting it through.Only Christmas has made him look elsewhere. Of course, what he got for Christmas was more construction trucks. We think he is going to be a construction engineer when he grows up:-)"
5,Love it!,This cement truck is so cute. The wheel is very easy to turn for little ones and you can actually add items inside the cement mixer. Front doors do not open...that would have been nice. Definitely recommend!!!
3,Overpriced,Flimsy for the price. Wish the doors opened so you could put figurines inside the cabin. Water nozzle could use on/off functionality so water doesn't flow straight out
2,broken pour shute,Not very sturdy. My son managed to break off the cement pour Shute about three days after Christmas.We have traveled and resettled since then and would like to get it replaced. Poor design or a mistake?
3,Very disappointed; not well made,"Considering what I paid for this truck, I would have expected it to be made of a stronger material. It's plastic and not very sturdy. We couldn't get it to work the way it's supposed to either, which frustrated me, although the grand kids used it anyway. But it is now a toy that sits in the corner of the basement and hardly used."
4,Lots of fun ... lots of water,"Overall a favorite toy.On the positive, it is pretty large, and detailed, with fun moving parts for a 2-3 year old.Just a note to parents: It inevitably gets water all over the place, which is of course fun, but you really don't want this on a carpet or floor that can't easily be mopped up. Outside is best!A bit of a shame because there are times when you just can't deal with all the water, so the toy isn't out all the time (or provokes whining!).I also agree with the comments about this toy being a bit on the fragile side -- not for riding on or rough treatment."
2,Arrived in used condition,"I ordered this truck from amazon. When I took it out of the box, I could tell it wasn't new. Other Bruder trucks from amazon come wrapped in plastic, this one did not and the body of the truck was scratched. I promptly returned it."
4,bruder cement truck,"a great toy and great value, lives in the sandpit at home and is indestructible. Works just like a real cement mixer truck."
4,Pretty hip,"I bought this as a gift for my 4 year old son. He loves it because he can actually fill the mixer up with sand and water and ""mix"" it up and then dispense the mess. Nothing makes my son happier than making a mess of sand everywhere. The mixing drum actually is engineered to push whatever you put in out, or in, depending on which way you turn the crank. The truck is made of plastic so you don't have to worry about rust, but it is not as durable as I would like. Overall, I say it is a good toy for a kid that loves to play in a sand box with trucks."
3,Nice Toy,"It is a nice toy and my three-year old son likes it. However, I was expecting something else, but it is OK.Update: it lasted about 8 months."
2,Just another big truck.,"I was really disappointed when I recieved this truck!! There were so many great reviews. It is just a big plastic truck. It isn't as sturdy or a heavy plastic like I thought and he can pull the water hose off and out of the truck, along with misplacing the bucket and cap. My son loves big trucks, but doesn't play with this one much."
4,"very good for home schooling, as early as 3rd grade.","A very good, simplistic, introduction for anyone who is just turning on to the internet. This includes myself -I'm 50- or my 9 year old daughter. The book has the ""child"" thoroughly examine the contents of a web page, write down what is found, and then goes on for greater, more intensive searches. This makes it invaluable for kids of all ages and abilities. In the end the student not only knows the screen contents,it's links,it's jargon, but also the whole connectedness that's hidden behind, in cyberspace. The work sheets for writing down what's been discovered; for written critiques of what is found is the joy of this book. It involves the student, at any level. Good job, Kim!"
5,Great stuff !!,"a very good cd which contains so many great jazz songs by great vocalists. Ella, Nat King Cole, Peggy Lee, Billie Holiday, Lousi Armstrong, Miles Davies and a lot more..."
3,A surprise western,"I chose this film simply because It looked like a good adventurous western with Glenn Ford, but I was in for a surpise when I discovered it was a low key story about a really good guy who is too good for is own good. Ford delivers a very believable performance as a very unusual humaitarian, but I was a little disappointed with his character's reaction to some of the situations he was faced with."
5,Stella was right !,"This book was clear and concise. Not a lot of tough words, very easy to understand and follow. The authors clearly knew what they wanted to convey in their books. They placed the information out there."
2,Save your money for a better dog bed,"At first look this bed seemed fine, but over time it's kind of flat and not of good quality for BIG dogs. Save up and get one that is more substantial if you have big dogs. It does clean up easily with the zip off cover, but I found it to be a waste of money."
4,Measuring spoons....,"What can you really say about measuring spoons? My only complaint was the ring they were attached too. I found it hard to use the spoons because it was attached to them too tightly. I solved the problem by taking them off of it and attaching them to an old key ring. Someone else might not care about this small thing, but it made a difference to me."
4,Decent quality. Decent price. Cant go wrong.,"Theres not alot I can say about measuring spoons really. They are made to a high standard, durable, easy to clean and dishwasher safe. At this price I dont see why you would need to pay more for a set of measuring spoons unless it was for decorative reasons."
2,Plastic gets brittle with age,"The ""storage clasp"" that holds the spoons together is a pain - I replaced it with a metal ring, and the set worked fine for about a year. Over time, however, the plastic has gotten brittle and two of the spoon handles have broken while I was hand washing them."
5,Well done!,I love the Black Widow and this book does it complete justice. I've seen larger books miss some of what this book contains so I would definately recommend it to enthusiasts. I noticed some nice info and pics I hadn't seen before so kudos to Osprey for another fine book!
1,"Actually, this book deserves no stars at all!!!","I bought this book about 4 years ago. After reading the book, I realized that Ralph Blum made up the accompanying meaning for the individual rune. Amazingly, he actually admitted it in his writing!!! If I extend his logic to its natural conclusion, I can take a deck of playing card, give specific meaning to each individual card and start doing some fortune telling on my own. This is exactly what he did with the rune letters."
2,An ALMOST complete abomination,"If this is your first encounter with the runes, i urge you; Keep the runeset, take out the blank rune, toss the book, and get a new one that DOESN'T rearrange the runes and add a blank one to fit the author's personal rearrangement of a system that hasn't been changed for a thousand years, at least until now. I give Ralph Blum some credit for his research, and at least knowing enough about the meanings of the runes to know how to rearrange them, but I urge you to buy a book that sticks to the real arrangement of the elder FUTHARK (note: it's called a futhark because those are the runes it begins with, and has begun with since their creation!), at least if you want to stick to tradition. However, he does provide enough information in the book to use the runes according to his views. So if you wish to use them his way, he does provide good information in the accompanying book."
1,The book of misinformation about the runes,"Thats a nice title for this piece of garbage! wow he christinized a pagan belief. to Ralph Blum the runes are just lifeless symbols, and a way to make a quick buck. Serious Vitkis laugh their sides off at this one. you are better off buying books by Edred Thorrson and Freya Aswynn these people know what they are talking about. Ralph Blums meaningless book deserves no stars.~Kali~"
3,A unique system- not quite compatible with other rune books,"This was the first book on runes I got, and while it served me well for a few years, as soon as I started reading other books on runes, I felt a little betrayed. Blum doesn't mention that there is an order to the runes that everyone but him abides by. He doesn't mention that there are countless other resources on the meanings. Reading his book, you get the idea that he somehow divinely accessed these meanings all by himself. I had to relearn the order of the runes and puzzle out the differences between his book and other more traditional books. He does have some phrases like ""wait on the will of god"" and such, but those never really bothered me and I'm pagan. I still have the rune set and book and refer to them from time to time, but I wish I'd started out with a more traditional book on runes."
1,Unfortunate,"It is unfortunate that the majority of people interested in the Runes start with this compendium of misinformation.I have studied the subject on both an academic and esoteric level for many years and have had no trouble finding an abundance of sources. Try your local University library, or the booklists in works by such authors as Edred Thorsson, who has a PhD in the subject."
1,Norse runes redefined a la Christianity,"I found this book not only insulting and annoying but a real rip off, in that the meanings of the Runes were heavily Christianized to suit Blum's worldview. He should have created his own system rather than bastardizing an ancient system that has worked for thousands of years."
5,Don't trust reviews and just read it,"If you've noticed, people who read this book either really liked it or hatet it to the point of cursing Blum and dismembering the actual book. I just bought the book and I really like it, even though the runes aren't very good. Fortunately, I have wonderful set that I obtained before the book, and the combination work beautifully. As for the origin and all that stuff...I'm sure there are people that are obsessive about the accuracy of the information, (mostly real witches who want you to know the real story behind them) but, as long as the runes work (which they do), who really cares? I mean, if they can help you solve everyday problems, then that's all that matters."
1,The runes have nothing to do with Wicca or the I-Ching,Poorly researched. Even a cursory look into the history of this ancient alphabet will confirm my opinion.
5,A truly wonderful beginners book fot the art of Rune Craft.,"I have truly enjoyed the experience of this book. Ralph Blum has kept true to form in writing this work. It is easy to follow and very informative. If you are new to Rune Craft this book is a must have! If you are and old pro, it is most likely in your collection now. Few books contain the most basic insights to casting runes, this work not only portrays them but does so accuratly. It offers several approaches to rune casting and rune play, the rune play totally new to Ralph Blum's works. Plus several new methods of rune casting make this book a fresh addition to any collection. The fact that this book comes with its own set of runes plus guidelines for attaining a new set, make it one of the best selections possible for a beginner or the simply curious. As a veteran reader of Ralph Blum this book truly stands out. I would recommend this book to anyone who is simply curious or just beginning in the art of Rune Craf"
1,"Interesting and a nice set of stones, but not very Nordic.","Mr. Blum has an interesting way of interpreting the runes,However, it has little to do with the Nordic system of interpretationHe uses a little too much Christianity and New Age in his interpretation.For the person who is interested in learning divination, however, the book and stones are a good starting point. I recommend that anyone who decides to buy this and start divining should get other books, written by authors more versed in the Viking and Nordic futhark (Rune alphabet) and add to their basic knowlege."
4,Great start for beginners,"This is a wonderful book for beginners. I do suggest that you continue your exploration with other books on the subject rather than limit yourself. As for all the negative reviews, it seems to me to be from those who get a little too snobbish and high and mighty about subjects they feel they are ""experts"" in. Where are the books they've written? Ignore them and use this book and the stones as an introduction and then go from there."
3,"A good starting place, but only a starting place","For the person who knows little or nothing about the Runes, this is a good starting place. The reader gets a set of Runes, a pouch, and a book.The book contains a little bit of history about the Runes and then for the most part, focuses on the casting techniques. It also gives the author's interpretations of the Runes.The reader should be aware that the author has changed the traditional grouping of the Runes, has included the blank Rune (a later addition that some people believe does not belong to the Runes) in his set, has devoloped his own interpretations of the Runes, and has included a very small amount of the History that is so important to the study of Runes.Overall, this is a good place to start, but it is only a starting place."
4,Runes,"This book is informative and easy to understand. If one is interested in reading runes, this is the book to read."
5,Excellent kit,I found this kit to be wonderfully amazing. I have used it for insight and guidance on everything from business to realationships. It's always astonishing how accurate the runes have been. After showing a girl at work how they are used she went right out and bought one too.
1,"Not a good book at all, no matter how popular it may be.","I bought this book many years ago. It was my first book on runes. What can I say. The author insults Odhinn, his esoteric knowledge is faulty to say the least and really he doesn't have a clue. There are plenty of other better books available, best not to bother with this one."
1,This book has very few upsides,"Yes, this book comes with a set of runes. That's the upside. The reason this book causes so much controversy is that some of us are Asatru, we actually believe in the Traditional Northern European religion. To us, the story of Odin hanging from the world tree to uncover the runes is like Jesus walking on water to Christians. So when man from some other faith comes along, takes our ethnic divination system, changes the esoterically significant order, fumbles the divine meanings, and creates new parts (e.g. the blank rune), well you can see why some of us would be a little put off by this. If you are a student of Norse culture, an Asatruar, or looking for a spiritual tool that resonates with the Ancient Tuetonic soul then I would suggest ignoring this book. Try Edred Thorsson instead."
1,"I'd rate lower, but they won't allow it!!!","Ralph Blum used the Oriental ""I Ching"" for the meanings of the runes and the casting techniques, not the viking versions of runecasting. He states that the runes are an ""oracle"" for divinatory purposes-- that is not so. Runelore is a whole genre of magick. Most rune magick organizations say to avoid this book at all costs. Ralph Blum should research his work more with the Northern traditions and consult experts in the field of runology. Examples are Edred Thorrson, Ymrin-Drighten of the Rune-Gild; and KveldulfR Gundarrson, who has a PhD in Teutonic Studies"
1,Blum's Book of Runes,"Indeed; someone else here mentioned that Blum is a treasure trove of MISinformation. This book is terrible. I'm another one who would give it 0 stars if possible. He scrambles up the order of the elder futhark, and if he knew anything about this stuff, he'd realize there is a reason for the runes to go in the traditional order that they do. He admitted that his first exposure to the runes was on mimeographed sheets with no page numbers, so he had no idea what order to put them in. He should have done research on it before writing a book. Avoid this book and read Edred Thorsson instead."
1,"Runes were made by cheap labour, I bet!","When I brought the Book Rune's it cost me what was it now.. $50AUS and it was the worst set of Runes I have ever laid eyes on, what made me very angry was the fact the it was the 10th Anniversary of the book. Ten years before, my mother had brought the same book and set and they were made with great care, all the glyph were well defined. The one ten years later look as though cheap labour was use to pump out the runes, they were made hastly. However the book, also not as good as My mothers was also cheap, interpritaions seem to make people understand, yet left alot to be disired."
1,Very false,"I wouldnt recomend this to any one I was excited about it when I first saw a copy nearly 10 years ago My friend had bought a copy and after reading it we tore it apart spat on it and burned it,I have never read a more false book on Runes in my life One should never buy runes, for the same reason Indengenous people never buy Sage or buy feathers Runes are to be cut on wood , For anyone who is Asatru STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK, it will only clout your mind with eastern religious bieleifs,"
5,Another Winner by Marty Kelley,"Marty Kelley's books are just great. So far I have Summer Stinks and Fall is not easy, I am hoping he comes out with the other seasons soon. My daughter loved this book, and the pictures are so cute.We heard about Mr Kelley originally when he visited my child's school in NH to do an ""author visit"". He read some of his stories, told the children about being an author, and even had the children participate while he made some funny drawings with the kids. My daughter and her friends loved the visit, and the teachers I spoke with thought it was really fun too.I highly recommend all of Marty Kelley's books -"
1,Blade of Kings is Dull,"Jacky and Donnie waste their talents on this ridiculously inane movie which begs the question, ""Why was this movie made?"""
4,Chinese entertainment,This is another well made product in the kung fu genre. Chinese filmmakers have improved their product and this is a good example. The action is fairly consistent and the plot very understandable. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in this genre.
1,Plain bad!!!,To start with I LOVE Chinese/Korean/Japanese/Thai cinema. I have more than 300 titles and I made the BIG mistake of buying Blade of Kings. I am a huge Donnie Yen fan so I had no doubt that I would buy this Blu-Ray as soon as it came available. BIG MISTAKE! To begin with the two female leads were terrible. As was Jaycee Chen. Just don't mistake and get this film.
1,Unwatchable,"This movie was so ridiculous, the story, costume design, sets, special effects, I couldn't finish it, and I ended up paying close to twenty dollars for it. The saving grace of the movie is supposed to be the fight scene between Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen, which was prettty good, but could not come close to saving this movie from total absurdity. The story about a woman dominated world, and men having to rally themselves against women, because the queen was turning men into a transgender species was too much. And the costume design and sets were garish, and made this movie look like a kindergardener's coloring book. Unwatchable and I tried two seperate times to finish it."
2,Stupid Film,"I bought this because Donny Yen is in it. Donny does such a great job in IpMan,and IpMan2. Too much time is spent on two females on wires who fly through the air. Donny Yen has great talent. It's wasted in this film."
1,Don't bother,This book was a big disappointment. I was looking forward to it since it came highly recommended from my doctor. I even gave it several extra chances because of that but I don't know what he was thinking - this book is commen sense pyschology and not much help for someone waiting or trying for a baby.
4,good book,This used book is in a very good quality though there is some hand-written inside. It is just only one part.
5,great cologne,"This is a great cologne, and one of my favorites. Way better than Old Spice in my opinion. I have gotten several compliments while wearing it."
3,"great little camera,but.......","This review is for those who want just the straight facts about negative aspects of the camera.i really like it, but for1.the shutter has about a 2 second delay from the time you actually click the button to take the picture and when it actually takes the image.this results in not getting the picture you wanted.2.its nice that its so small,but the metal is so smooth, that its easy to lose your grip.would be nice if it had some grip rubber somewhere on there.3.would be nice if it came with a case.other than those things, its a pretty cool camera with crystal clear pictures!"
2,"Great to use, but disappointing pictures","My old Kodak digital camera finally stopped working after being dropped too many times so I replaced it with this Sony after reading many reviews of comparable products.This camera is great to use, the menu options are easy to change and the USB interface makes downloading pictures very fast.However, the picture quality is most disappointing compared to my old Kodak. Color and contrast never look quite right, and at lower resolutions, the pictures look grainy - unlike the Kodak at the same resolution.Selecting ""Autobalance"" in Microsoft Photo Editor nearly always makes a difference - both for indoor and outdoor pictures.I will now be looking for a new Kodak model."
4,Very good camera,"This camera is really easy to use and you can take great pictures with it. I bought it two years ago and it still seems to be a good value for the price I paid. One of the features that I liked is the fact that it can record videos. I was thinking about buying a camcorder, but decided to buy this one instead. The quality of the video is Ok, not great. Currently, cameras with higher resolution can record better videos.Overall, I recommend this model to anyone who wants to buy a digital camera."
5,Great Camera!!!,"I highly reccomend this camera, it takes astounding pictures, stores them fast, and is very easy to use. I especially like the case, which is all metal and looks great. This is mostly a point and shoot camera, but has many customisable settings, and great battery life. I usually get about 1 and a half hours of battery life, which is plenty to fill up my 128mb memory stick. I reccomend buying a case and a bigger memory stick, because with the huge pics this camera takes, youll need more than what it comes with. This camera is definitely worth the money, and i would be willing to pay even more for it."
3,All around good camera,"i've owned this model for three years and it JUST gave out on me. The camera takes great photos, but sometimes stalls when you want to take that instant photo, so a lot of the ""kodak moments"" end up being staged since you have to wait around for shutter and all the redeye flashing to stop.the camera plugs into a computer nicely with the USB cable, making transferring photos a snap.The power source for the camera is a specific battery which doesn't last long, which was a problem on weeklong trips away from the charger.The shutter mechanism failed about one year into usage.But the thing's a workhorse, as i've taken about 1000 pics with it over the years. good starter camera"
1,Missing all accessories - unable to use camera,"I am very disappointed with this purchase. It was a Christmas gift for my daugther and she has been unable to use the camera so far (it's been three weeks since Christmas!) because it did not come with any accessories (battery charger, memory stick, or instruction manual) as was advertised. Also, it was merely wrapped in a piece of thin styrofoam when I received it. I had to purchase the charger and memory stick separately, and the memory stick does not fit. I have returned everything. Very poor service."
3,Not what i was expecting.,"HOW TO DRAW FANTASY FEMALES. Is the title of the book. I was looking for something to give me ideas and techniques i could use to find my own style of female cartoon style characters. However, this book is confusing in that it shows one example of one style, of one way to create it. Most of it is how to use Photoshop and 3d graphic software to create these characters, there is absolutely no sketches-to solid line-to color explanations or visual aids. If you're looking into graphic design or interested in making 3d models for a video game you'll never produce, then this is it."
3,"Good, but too much Poser","I purchased this book (without being able to see any interior pages), hoping it would be full of ideas, images, and techniques about how to draw and design ""sexy cybperpunks, etc"". Way too much time is spent on using Photoshop, Poser, and DAZ Studio. While these programs can be used to make excellent artwork (and I know numerous artists who use these programs), a book on ""How to Draw"" should not be talking about how to arrange Poser figures in a scene. Using Poser is like photography: you're arranging elements in a scene... there is no ""drawing"" involved."
2,Meh,"This book was not what I expected, its not a bad book, but not what I was looking for. Glad I only paid three bucks for it"
2,Not what you think,Drop the How to Draw from the title and you will get what you are paying for. This book covers software and tools used in the profession but lacks any step by steps useful to beginners and contains info already known by anyone with basic knowledge of character design. This book is more of a gallery of created characters.
2,"Not Great...Actually, less than great","I tend to buy a lot of ""How to Draw"" books, art books, etc. and, over the years, I've developeda pretty good sense of what works and what doesn't. Unfortunately, ""How to Draw Fantasy Females"" just doesn't work.This book is basically a look into different kinds of female sci-fi/comic book/fantasy characters. It gives information on archetypes (actually, there is a little character sheet-type list at the beginning of the book that will help you design different character ""types"") and provides a couple of pseudo-helpful tutorials on Photoshop and other programs, but is mostly a showcase of different kinds of femals genre characters. I was underwhelmed, to tell the truth - there is very little ""how to"" to this book at all. Unless you are a collector or a completionist, I recommend just staying away from this one and looking elsewhere."
4,On Straight Talk,"Straight Talk is a good book, especially for teens. It has a lot of true stories and examples that will catch our attention and hopefully encourage people not to have sex before marriage, to be sure about their partners, and to talk to others if they have had important issues in their sexual lives, such as incest or rape. Real life stories encourage positive decision making."
3,Where's the wheels,The model looks good and easily when together. Was surprised to find that it has no wheels. The stuff you hang from the wing falls apart if you breathe on them wrong.
1,Poor Design,I had to return this item because it was so poorly designed. I tried it on three types of watering hoses and it leaked in every application.The all plastic design just doesn't cut it.
1,A one-season wonder,"Even if you do get this screwed on tight enough to stop the leaking, the slightest nudge will cause it to start leaking and spray on your hand or in your face - not very pleasant when hosing the patio in chilly weather. Pistol grip will no longer shut off the stream nor change the spray pattern. I have to forcibly manipulate the mechanism to make it work. I should have been put off at the price of this from the start. Cheap junk is rarely satisfying."
4,function first,"I like the whole product line. It's an easy swap for watering to cleaning. Only downside is they are hard plastic and eventually will leak, messy."
3,good spray nozzle for the price,"This spray nozzle is a good value and seems to be durable, but it's not something you'll want to hold for more than a few minutes because it's not designed for comfort. It basically works as an on/off nozzle since the trigger doesn't adjust easily and remains locked in a position that is often too strong for watering your garden."
2,So hard to use,"This iron is so hard to use, I wish I could send back to get my money back. I will never figure this out no matter how hard I try, I am not coordinated enough! :("
1,DIDNT WORK! BROKEN!!,So i recieved this.. its defective i guess... i know i should have returned it... its my fault i forgot to. but what the eff. it turned on.. but it didnt heat up. i was SO excited for this. it was rated number 1!! so angry! eugh... luckily the other one i bought worked. or else.. i woulda been PISSEDDDDDDDD
3,I'll purchase from beauty supply store next time,"This curling iron fell apart within a month of purchasing. I was able to snap it back together several times, and finally, I got it to stay together so I continue to use them. The swivel cord does not swivel for me, which is very annoying when you are doing formal hairstyles for a wedding party. I'm guessing that these ones on amazon are 'seconds' or perhaps old product. I won't buy from amazon again for this tool. I will go to my beauty supply store instead, because the returns are easier."
3,could be better,Arrived fast. Barrel heats up great. Broke after the second time using it. Rubber comes off handle making it difficult to use. Disappointed.
2,OK...,"I know a lot of teenage girls will say I'm hating on Bow Wow and that I can't appreciate him because I'm too old. Not true. I think Bow Wow has skills, but this song doesn't cut it. It has the most generic Neptunes beat ever made, and the chorus is tacky. Also, a lot of the lyrics are irritating, like ""Mr. 106 & Park is back"" and ""I ain't tryin' to go out like Todd Bridges of Diff'rent Strokes"" (I don't know HOW he came up with that), and especially when he keeps saying ""Represent that"".Better luck next time."
4,An excellent beginning,"I enjoyed this book so much ~ the characters, storyline, etc. When I finished I couldn't wait to read the rest in the series. If you like fantasy with strong women read this book."
5,Suprisingly fabulous,Normally I read books that most would consider as light entertainment. I like a quick read. When I picked up this book I didn't plan on liking it but oh man.. I was SUCKED IN! From the beginning I was always waiting for what would happen next and how the events would unfold. It was most definitely a page turner. There is a lot going on in this book and I loved that it wasn't predictable and I loved how dynamic the characters were. I had to get to know each character to decide about them and overall.. I really enjoyed all of the plot lines.I also felt that it had a satisfying ending yet I can't wait to get the next book.
5,excellent,"i was very surpriced, in a positive way, about this book and his author. gehlen was the head of the eastern branch of the german military intelligence. it brings a very good picture of the use of good intelligence in the planing of foreign politics and the eventual need to go to war. amazing is the fact that many warnings and analysis made by the author and his staff were disregarded by the nazi politicians. i'm still reading the book, but i could not wait to write already a positive note. this book is a must for a foreign service official, military intelligence and history student."
5,A dire warning from the past,"General Gehlen's book, published in 1972, is a dire warning of the ongoing threat to freedom of communism. He discusses the Middle East crisis between Palestine and Israel as a problem that will persist for decades. (In light of current events, how right he was) The book also chronicles the subversive tactics of the communist/socialist/""progressive"" movements throughout the world who claim to want peace but only seek the destruction of capitalism and the downfall of the West. An insightful thought provoking book more relevant now than it was 30 years ago."
5,"A Must-Read for Vegans, or Those Considering a Healthier Diet!","This book was written by a chair within the American Dietetic Association. It is the most comprehensive veg nutrition book I have ever read, and offers astounding evidence that eating a vegan diet dramatically reduces most of the diseases that plague modern society, including certain types of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. She bases all of her statements on sound research and an historical study comparing disease rates in vegan and meat-eating populations. I pay attention to nutrition, but I still learned a lot by reading this book. Her suggestions probably saved me a lot of grief in the future.An extremely valuable book. I can't recommend it highly enough.(Another book that compares diets over decades is ""The China Study."")"
1,Couldnt do it,I couldn't make it past 20 pages of the this book. I even skimmed it to find something useful but to no gain. I would not advise you to buy this book. sorry
3,A Little Too Technical,"This book is a dry read on the history and development of becoming a vegan. It addresses many concerns on a very high level, however, if you are looking for a step by step plan to guide your migration to becoming a vegan, this is not it."
3,"Registered, Liscensed Dietitian Nutritionist","I am a dieitian and I used this book as a reference for a presentation I was putting together for a local Vegetarian/Vegan group. While I found the most of information to be interesting and truthful, I also found some entries/conclusions to off and/or misleading. While the data is somewhat current (2000), there have been several changes in the past 5 years. I would encourage anyone wanting to follow a Vegan diet to contact a registered dietitian for menu/meal planing."
2,BECOMING VEGAN BOOk - just ok,"This book was not really great reading for a newbie. I have not picked it up since the first day. Not worth the price. It might be great for someone else though. It was packed with information, just too much for my level."
2,"Conversational, upbeat","I was disappointed in the book, finding it a little too conversational in style and superficial in its treatment of significant health aspects of the vegan lifestyle. However, it's likely to be a good choice for those new to the topic who don't know much about health aspects of food and who need the constant rah-rah upbeat prods of the writer to continue reading."
2,Newbie Vegan,"I knew giving up animal products was the right thing to do, but after reading ""Becoming Vegan,"" I got the impression that it would have to be a long, gradual process, as (according to page v of the book) one of the co-authors is not yet vegan herself.If you're looking for the motivation to become vegan, I urge you to listen to Bruce Friedrich's compelling essay ""Veganism in a Nutshell"" (for free) at http://www.brucefriedrich.org/. I started and completed my transition to veganism during that hour-long reading.Perhaps ""Becoming Vegan"" is a good starters guide for already-vegans, but it's not much in the way of inspiration."
5,Lots of useful information but not overwhelming,"I've been vegan for a year-and-a-half now and reading this book helped me to make some important adjustments to my diet. Though keeping vegan takes a giant step toward improving health (not to mention the environment and animal welfare), it's not enough simply to eliminate animal products and eat more vegetables and lentils. The specific and easily comprehensible advice in this book tells you how to get enough iron ... calcium ... B-12 ... Omega-3s (and not too many Omega-6s). I also feel better equipped to field questions from ill-informed friends and, alas, doctors. And if you have a geeky side (as I do), you will enjoy the rigorous way in which research is examined and presented. I wish I'd discovered this book sooner."
5,Truely a Reference Book,"This was my first book by Vesanto Melina but not my last. I found this book so well done I bought her (also coauthored with Brenda Davis) second book, 'The New Becoming Vegetarian'.This book is very thorough and well written. As the cotitle states, it is 'The Complete Guide to Adopting a Healthy Plant-Based Diet'.It is filled with facts, data tables, figures, and general overall guidance. I will be referring to the book often.I highly recommend the book if you are starting down the path of vegetarianism."
2,Helpful,"This book was helpful, but not what I was looking for. I need a book that will assist me in selecting the right foods and what to look for. I grew impatient after the first chapter."
2,Mixed feelings,"There are some good informations in this book, so I'm not giving it one star, but the recipes aren't appealing at all, and they don't examine every con in a vegan diet, for example they don't consider how unhealthy is soy, how eating seitan can be a problem for celiacs and how it, not milk, brings calcium away from our bones. I've given it away after keeping, but don't using, it for years."
5,Far More Than a Simple Biogaphy,"This is in outstanding piece of work! It has become one of my books of the year.Radical Prince is an exploration of an array of exceedingly important ideas, seen through the lens of the life and work of the Prince of Wales. Misunderstood by many, the Prince has already made major contributions in a number of different fields. From an early age, he has dedicated his life to the betterment of humanity.Many outstanding teachers have gravitated towards him. Not so much because he is a Prince, but because of his inner spiritual Being.It is difficult to imagine anyone other than David Lorimer - the former director of the Scientific and Medical Network - being able to write this book, which needed forays into so many different areas of our existence: health, ecology, architecture, education and several others.For anyone with even a passing interest in a broader view of our lives and our place in the Universe, this is a ""Must read."""
3,"Fits perfectly, though lacking in air flow","I bought the Flowmaster 425501-L 50, Flowmaster 425501-R 50, and Walker Exhaust 40305 Y-Pipe for my 1984 Corvette. The Y pipe fit perfectly to my Catalytic converter, however I did notice that the inside of the pipe wasn't done all that well at the location where the two pipes initially split, there are two sections of the pipe sticking halfway through the single pipe, which makes it look like a lot of air would get trapped there, thus slowing the exhaust flow."
5,Cruella de Ville's Favorite Book,"Finding myself without aim or purpose, I took a journey of self-enlightenment throughout the Amazon Basin, Northern Tibet, and the Kalahari Desert.I wrote a book called Rot, Freeze, Burn (a sort of homage to Eat, Pray, Love).On my journey, this book was recommended to me by a Zuruah Chieftain, a Tibetan Shaman, and a Bushman. Each considered it a spiritual sequel to their respective classics: Knitting With Capuchin Monkey Hair, Knitting With Yak Hair, and Knitting with Zebra Hair.But let us give credit where credit is due:Cruella de Ville had the idea first."
3,Rethink the product,"My dog has short hair. Turns out that after a poodle is shaved bald, there's not much to knit with."
5,great knitting book for pet lovers,finally....a great book for what was once considered annoying pet hair....LOVE IT
5,woof woof!,"Hey Amazonians!My name's Kibbles and I'm a golden retreiver! My mommy likes to give me treats and pet me, but she also loves to brush me more than anything else! Mommy tries to bring me everywhere with her, but sometimes I am not allowed in stores or restaurants! Mommy felt very sad without me! She was very happy when she read this book! Now she can make sweaters out of my hair, so when she's wearing them it's like I am with her! Mommy loves me!Kibbles"
5,A fine example of surrealism-in-everyday-life.,"An optimist, musing over his half-full bathroom glass after dropping a wet bar of soap, might be moved to think ""Gee, I wonder if there's something positive to be made of all that stuff sticking to my soap?"" ""Knitting With Dog Hair"" provides an ample collection of ways to turn the liability of all that messy pet hair into an asset. The book is perfectly straightforward, and really does tell you how to turn dog hair into human clothing, without the mess of having to slaughter Fido, at home in your spare time. ""Knitting With Dog Hair"" served as our first coffee table book after we bought a new coffee table, more because of its (to me) surreal subject matter than anything else. As a non-knitting cat owner, I found that ""Knitting With Dog Hair"" provided still more confirmation of the general superiority of cats over dogs."
2,Nothing really new,"I was very disappointed with this book. Not only was it expensive (over $50)and short (101 pages including the index) there was little information that couldn't be found in any other beginning spinning book. Basically, all I gleaned from it was to handle dog hair like you would handle Alpaca. Sort out the short pieces & junk, wash it the same. Use common sense when looking at a dog to spin. Is the hair long, coarse, soft, scratchy. How it feels on the dog, is how it's going to feel made into yarn. They do have a listing of the various breeds of dogs and the types of hair, but again, use common sense.If I knew before hand that this was a book on the VERY basics of how to spin fiber, I would not have bought it."
2,misleading cover,"My only complaint is the cover is misleading, there is a picture of a basset hound on the cover but you can't spin basset fur. I own a basset and bought the book because of the cover."
4,Fascinating story. Should be on ALL handicap reader lists,"Worded beautifully contrasting the tale's harsh reality and details. Very useful for family or friends of individuals who are relating to profound physical or mental disability for the first time. It is an up-lifting story which reminds us that despite all the odds, where there's a will, there's a way."
3,Good check lists!,"You like to learn the entrepreneurial mindsets from this book. The authors teach this course, at the Executive MBA program, of Columbia Univeristy (only $15,000 for five days). Of course your company pays for it. If not, reading this book is a good alternative ($20 is not bad). The problem with the book, is generality. It does not provide examples of any individual or firm that has been successful with the use of the entrepreneurial mindset. It is like teaching you all the theory to be successful, but no examples on how these theories can be put into action. I stronly disagree with most of the reviewers here that this is a useful book to start a business. It is not. However if you wish to learn the theory, this is the book for you. I would like to find out if the authors themselves, started any business of their own by using these theories."
4,The Entrepreneurial Mindset,"The product arrived in a timely manner, but including highlighting that was not mentioned in the description."
3,They are loud,"These are great looking very shiny shoes. When I say ""shiny"" - you can almost use them as a mirror. The top part (just the horizontal part) is made of real snake skin, no clue what snake and only hope that they didn't kill those poor snakes to make a pair of cheap boots... It is a unique thing, there is even a metal plate on the outsole that says ""Genuine snake skin"". They feel OK on my legs, no issues with that. There is one problem however and the problem is very annoying. No clue what they made heels of but they make a very loud sound when you walk. I mean you sound like a lady on high heels or a freaking dancer. When I'm in the office I try to always walk on carpets so people don't stare at me when I'm walking. Other than that shoes are OK for less than thirty bucks and look more expensive then they are. Snake skin - OMG"
5,My son LOVES these shoes!,He has five pairs of these shoes in different styles and colors. He says they are as comfortable as they are stylish which when you are on stage is important. He has a pair for every tux.
2,poorly made,"I purchased a pair of these shoes, but had to return them - when they arrived a seam on the top of one of the shoes was missing about half an inch of stitches in one spot, resulting in a gaping hole through which the underlying material of the shoe was visible."
4,"Great book, but make sure you know what it you're buying","I was under the impression that this was a book for all couples wanting information on conceiving. It is actually more focused on infertility and oververcoming/dealing with infertility. There are some helpful chapters on BBT charting and drug-free ways to improve your conception chances (which is more what I was looking for), but as I mentioned beofre the primary focus is on infertile couples."
1,Cover of book misleading,"I bought this book thinking it would be a good read before my husband and I started trying for a baby. The cover captions looked like there would be some great information inside. However, when I got the book and read the table of contents I immediately realized it was a book about infertility. I only give it 1 star not based on the content but on the misleading cover of the book. I'll have to pay better attention next time!"
1,No Good,I had just finished reading Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler (WONDERFUL BOOK). I was anxious to read more on the subject of getting pregnant so I bought this based on the 2 reviews it was given. I was horribly disappointed. Unless you have infertility problems I would not reccomend this book. Taking Charge of Your Fertility is a much bettter book for anyone who is trying to get pregnant or just wants to know more about their body.
2,choose another book!,"I've recently come into the TTC group and have sought out many books to get prepared...this book looked good, said all the right things on the cover but when I got it home, it was very hard to stay interested! It was like a textbook, not a very difficutlt read but difficult to want to keep reading. Now I'm ordering new books because I dislike this one so much. I'm sure if has useful information, but I'd rather read something more ""personable""."
1,Misleading title!,"I bought this book for simple clear baby making tips, what I found was a book focused primarily on infertility. If you want to read about all the things that can go wrong,and get paranoid about foods you eat by all means get this book!"
1,WARNING!!! DANGEROUS MISINFORMATION!! DONT BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"WARNING! THIS BOOK CONTAINS DANGEROUS MISINFORMATION!!! I recently ordered this book from an on-line website (author Debra Fulghum Bruce and Samuel Thatcher, M.D.) On p. 172 the doctors discuss folic acid requirements for expectant mothers...they say that you should be taking 1,000 milligrams. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG!! You should only be taking 1,000 micrograms at the most! The book made me panic! My prenatal vitamin only contains 1 milligram (1,000 micrograms), so I was afraid I was subjecting my baby to possible spina bifida. I called the pharmacist and he confirmed that I should only be taking 800-1,000 micrograms. 1,000 milligrams, as the book recommends, would be WAY TOO MUCH! This book runs the risk of sending expecting mothers into a panic and potentially causing a dangerous overdose of folic acid. Don't read this book! Find another source. Any author that would be this careless is not the source you want to approach for help!"
5,Great Movie,This was an awesome movie and it had a great story line. I love the actresses and actors who played in this movie. This is a movie well done. The grass is not always greener on the other side.
4,I liked it,"This was a play and not a movie, so for a play i thought is was good. Had a nice mix of themes, comedy was done well and not over done, acting was fine. I enjoyed the acting of Ms Fox she helped keep the play together and i also liked Brian McKinghts singing the dvd is worth that alone. If you are a fan of plays this one should be in your collection."
5,Great Play,Great Inspirial play which gets down to the core values in marriages. A must see play and add it to your collection.
5,BEST PLAY EVER,I saw this play live in Indiana Vivica's Home town and I laughed the whole time. Not only that it keep you guessing the whole way through. There is nothing but good things that I can say about this play. The whole cast was amazing. But it was Vivica and Brain who stole the show.
1,Pure trash!,"Do not waste your life on this movie. It sucks!!! Yes, it has its rare funny moments but in general, the movie stinks."
1,Horrible,This was horrible. I rented it and for what! It was horrible. I watched the first 30mins without even one laugh. I then looked at my wife who fell asleep. Needless to say it was horrible. Its in the comedy section without any comedy in it.
1,terrible!,I was hoping the play would get better..after 30 min of watching them overact and try to amuse i gave up. I was surprised because u know Vivica can act but shes not the same anymore i assume. Terrible play please dont waste your time. It deserves 0 stars really.
4,Better than I thought,"I am not much into plays, but this one was better than I thought. It was good to see Karen Malina White again. Vivica was great as usually. The surprise was Brian McKnight, he do have some acting ability. I will definitely buy this play."
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a book (or booklet) like any other. I find however that it is a commentary ON the writing of John Knox of that title. There are extensive quotes FROM the original work, in the original medieval English, and maybe it is all there somewhere, but I cannot find the complete work within its pages. It is thus a very confusing document as you're not clear what it is trying to say or where it is going. Why can't they just present us with the original work (as expected) and allow the reader to form his/her own view on it? I am still working my way through it, so it may yet redeem itself, when I find out what this book is trying to do and be!"
3,Classical Misogynist Diatribe,"This is a classical misogynist diatribe made by Scottish churchman, John Knox, a principal founder of the Scottish Reformation. When he wrote this book in 1558, he was in exile from his native land and furious with several powerful women, among these being (Bloody) Mary of England, Mary, Queen of Scots, and Catherine de Medici the Queen of France, all of whom he saw restricting the Reformation and corrupting their nations against the laws of God and man. The irony here is that he was later supported by Queen Elizabeth I of England, who was one of the greatest friends of the Protestant Reformation in both England and Scotland."
5,The Pre-Buying Book,"We're about a year away from buying a home, and this workbook has been our guide to get us focused and to actively take steps to make sure we're in the best position possible--financially, emotionally, and intellectually--before we even start looking at homes. We followed Glink's suggestions on getting our credit reports in order and are now looking up information on exclusive home buyers agents. We'd be lost without the worksheets and the sound advice she gives."
1,Truly useless.,"Back when I was looking for a home I bought about four books to learn all about it. It was all for naught as I learned more listening to the people involved in the business and homeowners. In no time at all I could guess the prices of homes across my state... and in many cases in other states as well. All in all, I ignored most realtor advice and got my house super low AND an excellent mortgage. Though had I gone with another realtor who was a friend I could've gotten the same deal on a bayside house. D'oh!"
2,Rust Problem,This shower curtain is attractive UNTIL YOU WASH IT AND THE GROMMETS ALL RUST AND STAIN the white shower curtain. ugh how annoying
4,Minimalist music that works,"I had never heard the original (non-stalteri-arranged) versions of these pieces, so I really don't have anything to compare them to, but the music on this disc is great in it's own right. My favorites are the Opening, a very melancholy piece that conveys very strong feelings, and ""Mad Rush"", which really rocks. especially the fast parts, but the whole thing is good.And the rest of the disc isn't bad either, especially because of the abscence of the trademark ""123432"" Glass riff, which gets REALLY annoying when plastered all over the place like he usually does.I've always thought that the minimalists have ""figured things out"", and this album is no exception. Play in the evening, with friends or in the rain."
4,Lovely Songs,This a great collections of old songs that are fun to listen to. These songs are great to listen to when you are just relaxing or cleaning around the house. I always pop it in when I feel like listening to some romance classics.
5,A must read,"Before this book, the only experience I have had with the Amish was visiting Lancaster, PA and sampling their crafts and food. It was fascinating to learn about the author's life and growing up in the Amish community. I learned many things from this book, some happy and some sad and think it was very courageous of Esther Royer Ayers to share her story. I think it is a must read for anyone interested in other cultures."
4,Read book,"It was a good romance book that was short and not to long. If you want to read something because that is the mood that you are in, but aren't sure if you are going to keep reading into the next day."
2,From Back Cover,"Sheikh Ashraf possessed the fortitude of a hundred sultans--still, he was mightily tempted by the seductive allure of the mysterious and ravishing Dana Morningstar. Never had a woman unraveled his restraint like the sumptuous television celebrity. But for Ashraf, romance was unfathomable-his objective was to seize his family's stolen throne. In this power struggle, was Dana a courier of danger, an assassin's bait? Ashraf's instincts said she was an ally.... Still, to control the vixen, he would keep her close as a lover. Perhaps a night of passion would conqure all doubt!3rd in the Sons of the Desert: The Sultans series"
5,A truly amazing read!,"Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down and wound up reading it in one sitting (approximately 2 hours). I could see the events of this book actually happening one day in the future. I got excited at the possibility millions and millions of souls coming to Christ through the use of modern technology. A great read!"
5,"Hits you in the Heart, Just Wonderful!","What a wonderful story. Although told through fictional characters it was like I already knew them. The special Grandmother who adores her Grandson. Best Friends at college.The one true love of the main character. And woven throughout this story of a young man becoming a business man is the wonderful truth about who God is, and what His plan is for every life. I particularly liked the "" real world "" situations in the novel. If your looking for a good read that will touch your heart at the core, WAKE UP! This book is the one!"
1,"Superficial, poorly edited, stale.","The postgraduate seminar that I take part in chose this text because we hoped that it would offer a taste of various aspects of the cultural study of music that we weren't already familiar with, we hoped that it would make a good starting point for interesting discussions on issues in contemporary music and musicology. We were wrong! This book is superficial at best. A large part of every discussion was spent complaining about the poor quality of the scholarship or the hatchet job the editors have obviously done on the articles. Most of the ideas in this book are stale and much better discussions occur in other publications. It's disappointing to see authors of Lawrence Kramer's quality in a collection this bad, his was one of many articles in which simple ideas became confusing because of poor editing. This attempt to make musicology bite size fails miserably. The only useful thing about this collection is the list of further reading at the end of each article."
1,what a nightmare!!,"This book was one of the worst reading experiences I've had. I can't imagine how the information in this book could be useful in any way. The contributors are long-winded and never really say anything substantial, probably due to poor editing. STAY AWAY!!"
1,Sizing is off,"I'm a big boy, 4x should have covered me with some room. Was so tight I couldnt even sit down. Material is very light weight, in the light I could see through the camo shorts. Probably would not have held up many washes... Very disappointed with this order! I shall continue to search for the perfect ""fat guy"" clothes!"
2,huh,"in the search i was looking for womens camo capris and these poped up.plus i noticed the strings at the end of the capri pant sleeves and automatically thought it was womens.But i it started to look like maybe i shouldv asked before buying,because at the top it didnt really specify wrether it was for male or female. lil important if you dont want the crotch of the pants to stick out if your a women ya know,kindv weired."
4,3/4 length pants - perfect for outdoors,"I guess other people who've written a review about these pants were worried about how they'd ""look in them"" - IF THEY ACTUALLY BOUGHT THEM, but they didn't and so what was the point?....The pants are amazing - if you're an outdoor person and you understand that staying cool is important - these pants rock on the trail or in a canoe."
4,Tasteless!,"A DVD for the still Big KIds at Xmas, very bad taste, but for the KIDS, got a big THATS FUNNY!!!! The Host is the big draw!! Very Big!!!"
2,"A delightful idea, but ultimately a disappointment.","Andrew Bird's first band recordings were not with the Bowl of Fire, the Squirrel Nut Zippers, or Kevin O'Donnell's Quality Six. Bird started out in Chicago with Charlie Nobody playing a strange and embarrassing blend of American ska and alternative rock.I enjoy ska and I love Andrew Bird (and O'Donnell, the Bowl of Fire's terrific drummer, even plays on this recording), but ""Soup"" happens to be a painful listen. The songs are typical of no-name, artless, novelty-leaning ""3rd wave"" ska bands of the nineties, and Mr. Bird's violin skill unfortunately does not help this predicament at all. In fact, it's an awkward fit that only worsens the appeal of the album.There certainly aren't any standout tracks, although it is interesting to hear an earlier version of Bird's Nuthinduan Waltz and one or two others he later refined.Even the most devoted Andrew Bird fans needn't drop a dime (literally, if you look at the used prices) on this one."
4,A hard to find CD worth looking for,"This is a great CD from Jim Reeves. Very hard to find as it is one of his international releases. Good music with a couple of songs (such as Heartbreak In Silhouette), that you won't find on any other CD. Found it thanks to Amazon!"
5,An Eye Opening Piece of Work!,"Rootwork is a slice of Black history, a piece of magical self help advice on a wide range of everyday problems and a whole lot of fun. You go girl!"
3,Nice Book,This book was very easy to read and understand. I appreciate the fact that the author included rootwork that doens't take much to hunt down the indgriedients. My family heritage is in New Orleans voodoo so some of what was written brought back many memories.
3,A SIMPLE INTRODUCTION,"Rootwork, or depending on what part of the country you live in, hoodoo or voodoo has been a part of Afro American culture from the begining. Tayannah Lee McQuillar has, in this plain and spare little book put together a number of spells with simple explanations. If you believe in rootwork then this book is too simple for you. If you are just becoming interested in black folklore then this book may be a good and simple introduction to the subject. If you want something more in depth and better written check out Blue Roots or Faith Mithchell's book."
2,Very Vague,"I bought this book to introduce myself to a part of my culture, but while the history of Hoodoo was ok (could have been a little more detailed), the spells were very vague. A beginning pratitioner would not do well to use this book because of the vagueness of the spell instructions & the inability to contact the author (her contact info does not work--tried several times including doing an online search). This book is ok as a quick, but not as a sufficient, resource tool. Use it for a brief intro to Hoodoo & nothing more. I would advise spending the extra money on a really indepthed book on Hoodoo tradition & spells to get a good understanding of the history & pratice before delving into this dynamic culture."
5,Very helpful book,"I got my copy of ""Final Passage"" and sat down and read it in one day. Barbara Whitfield was so right about it being full of ""aha's"". I used a whole box of kleenex that day; it was emotionally wrenching, but I couldn't put it down. I have loaned it to my step-daughter (my husband,her dad died of cancer in 2001). She is having a very difficult time reading it because of the emotions it brings up, so she is taking one chapter at a time with lots of time in between.I went ahead and ordered another copy along with ""Spiritual Awakenings"" I just started reading it and haven't had time to read much, but I wanted to say Barbara's books are very helpful for understanding some of life's difficult issues."
4,"La Caniglia, prima donna assoluta!","This is a so-so opera given a blazing performance by the great Maria Caniglia.This opera seems to attract the legendary, full-voiced sopranos: Caniglia, Tebaldi, Olivero They all sound fine in their respective recordings, even leading one to think for a moment that Fedora, the opera, actually approaches adequacy as a work of art.The rest of the cast on this recording is perfectly adequate. The previous reviewer is obviously more taken by the tenor, Prandelli, than I am, but he is certainly worth the listen and the the equal of any tenor now recording.(For those considering the rival recording by the wonderful Olivero: her tenor is the early 1960s version of Giuseppe diStefano. Poor man, it is sadly painful to hear that once-glorious voice in such a wretched state.)Five stars for Caniglia and Prandelli, less one for the lumbering vehicle in which they are stuck."
1,Disappointing,"Software is not Vista-compatible, and hardware is strictly USB 1.0 only, it will not work with USB 1.1 or 2.0. Apparently Estes does not consider these limitations grounds for a warranty return, either.I did manage to capture video once with Vista, but now the program crashes when it tries to retrieve video. As other reviewers noted, the switch is very difficult to move and the software UI is awful.Great idea, poor execution."
2,Cool rocket falls short of Vista,"This rocket is AWESOME. It flys pretty high, and takes decent pictures during the assent. It can also record video. The shortcoming is that the software that comes with it does not work with Windows Vista. The pictures/video need to be downloaded after each launch. Since most rocket launches take place in remote locations, a laptop needs to be used for downloading, and almost all laptops come with Window Vista - in that respect it is pretty useless. Estes is aware of the need, but they havn't delivered a software patch yet. There was also no forewarning of it's Vista shortcomings, so don't spend $70 if are even thinking about using it with Vista."
5,LOVE!,"This made traveling with our little one such a breeze. Our Graco carseat fit on easily, attaching and releasing the device was a little tricky at first, but once we got the hand of it, it was great! We loved traveling with this and were very happy to have the long handle and super big castors on the wheels to make rolling over various surfaces super easy."
5,Great for Britax carseat!,"We love our GoGoKidz TravelMate. It works PERFECTLY with our Britax Marathon. I'm buying a second now that I have two kids in carseats. While the aisles on all of the planes I have been on have been too narrow for my carseat to glide through, the TravelMate still makes traveling so much easier."
1,Sadly disappointed.,"Part of the attraction to this product was that the carseat could be easily attached and removed. I was shocked to find out when I purchased the product that you actually have to screw the straps on and unscrew to get them off. That does not make traveling easier when you have to go through security as well as deal with impatient people on the airplane waiting for you to get situated etc, etc. Isn't the point to make traveling easier? If only someone could figure out a way to make it snap on and off."
4,Very helpful in the airport,We've used this for flying with a car seat six times now and it has been very helpful. I love that I can wheel my son all the way on and off the plane. This was especially important when I flew solo with him. I've never had a problem with it fitting down an economy aisle or through security while still attached to the car seat (Radian 65L). It's a little cumbersome to get on and off the seat but it gets easier with practice and I definitely recommend practicing at home before you use it in the airport for the first time.
4,A life saver in the airports,"Travelling through airports with a baby in an infant carrier isn't too bad since it has a handle. Travelling with a toddler seat is a pain. Navigating airports using the GoGo Babyz Kidz Travelmate was SO helpful. Instead of needing a separate stroller and figuring out how to carry the toddler seat along with all of our luggage and carryons, we kept our son in his seat and wheeled him around. We had a little trouble attaching his seat to the Travelmate in a way that wouldn't cause the seat to rest on the wheels causing them not to roll. After a little rigging with the strap, we got it to work perfectly. Travelling with a little one isn't easy, but this product made it a whole lot easier."
5,Great Product,My kids love this so much that they wanted to sit in it and be wheeled around the living room since the second we got it and put our spare car seat on it to try it out. Looking forward to using it on an upcoming trip to Germany with our small kids. Got this for $20 less on Amazon than elsewhere.
4,Makes traveling a breeze!,"This is a great product. It attached to my Britax Marathon very easily. My son loved riding in it to the airport terminal. A couple down-sides: it didn't fit on one x-ray belt at one airport and had to be ""wanded"", also it did not roll down aisle on airplane, but with flight attendant help you'll be fine. I was traveling solo with my 22 month old and was very pleased with this product. I also received lots of compliments and it's much easier than having extra baggage with a stroller & carseat!"
4,works great!,"We used this when we travel;d to Puerto Rico with our 7 month old. It makes carrying the car seat through the airport so easy! Our daughter enjoyed being wheeled around in it so we could check the stroller. The only cons are you have to have to take the child out of the car seat to take the carrier on and off and with our model of car seat, we had to remove the base. Oh yeah, the car seat dosen't always fit through the metal detector with the carrier attached, but security can hand scan it for you."
4,Lifesaver in the airport!,"I was initially reluctant to get this because it seemed so expensive but I was making my first airplane trip with my 8 month old, so I went for it. It worked perfectly! It fit our car seat with no trouble. Once i got the hang of hooking it on and taking it off, it was really easy to use. I suggest playing with it a bit before the first use. The travelmate is flat already so there's no need to fold anything before you toss it into the overhead bin. I didn't tug my son in it at all in the airport but we did around the house a little and he seemed to like it. This is a must have for those who use a car seat on the plane. We even hooked our carry on bags to it and that really helped when we had to walk so far to our car. We used this with a Britax roundabout convertible car seat. The only reason this gets 4 stars is because I thought the price was a bit much. $40 or 50 would be a much better price for this."
4,"Very Good Product,,,,,,but.","The product lives up to its description. Very easy, for the most part, to use. The strap and mechanism can get difficult to loosen if you have really tight. But it is a good product and our child enjoyed being in their seat through out the airport.The problem is not with the product but with our car seat and the airlines. We spent up on a super duper car seat which is wide and thus did not fit down the isle of the airplane. We took to different crafts on our recent trip and it fit barely down the 2x2 style plane but the Airbus 317? 3x3 it had no chance. We were in the first few rows so i simply lifted the whole thing along with my child up and over. But that would not be an option for all.I would suggest going online to the many airtravel blogs, and get the isle widths for the plane you are flying and compare to your carseat.Since this product depends on carseats have functionality I am explaining the caveat based on some car seats not fitting in the aisles of the planes."
4,Lasted for about 7 flights,"UPDATE:I am downgrading this rating to 4 stars since right before the 8th flight, the strap was inserted incorrectly and got totally stuck. So we had to cut it at the airport and leave the travelmate behind...ORIGINAL REVIEW:I flew with my son on four flights with the Kidz Travelmate hooked on a Britax Advocate 70 CS and I am super happy with it. It's extremely easy to attach to the car sear - literally takes less than 10 seconds - and even though detaching it is a little bit annoying, it it done in the same amount of time. And I got a good hang on it since I had to attach and detach it many times, between the limo, the X-Ray machines, the plane seat, taxi, and back 4 times...The problem I've had during these lights is not about the Travelmate. It fits through everywhere I've been. But the Britax car seat doesn't! It's a very wide seat, with a non-removable base... So next on my list: a narrow car seat, which will be set on the Travelmate for the next trip!"
4,Consider this if you travel with kids - definitely,"This product is a terrific idea for traveling parents, and well-made too! We love that we can bring our carseats with us and make them useful, not just something bulky to carry. The kids sometimes enjoy riding in their rolling carseats, but even when they don't, we can just use them to haul bags through the airport. While the old design with bolts seemed (at least psychologically) a little more secure, the new version (that attach with a strap) are more universal and are much faster to use."
5,The perfect airport accessory,"We have two kids under the age of two and this ""car seat on wheels contraption"" was amazing! we used it last year when we traveled from Germany to the states. B/c once you check the stroller, it really is difficult to get the kids through the airport with the carry ons and keep track of everyone! I recommend every parent get one of these, you might actually enjoy traveling with a toddler. (Might!) and it folds down and easily shows above you in the over head compartment. the only problem we had was trying to wheel my son through the plane, the wheel base is kind of wide, but it has to accommodate wide car seats so i understood. (Can not use with infant carseats!)"
3,Middling,"My initial misconception was that the plate attached underneath the car seat - I'm going to blame the poor quality printed instructions...If it is necessary to reposition the base of the strap, the screws are very difficult to work with.Instead of a screw and nut arrangement, there are 2 screw heads.Furthermore, the quality of the screws is poor and exerting pressure to turn them can easily mutilate the screw head.I'm not sure that the single strap is going to be adequate to hold the plate and handle in position, I'll have to see how the trip goes."
5,A Travelling Family's Best Friend!,"The best travel investment ever! We are a family of 4 who just completed a 2 stop international journey with the Go-Go Babyz Kidz Travelmate. It got us through LA, Seattle, and Reyjavik airports without a hitch. Our 13yr old pushed our 16month old from one terminal to the next with ease. We removed it once on the plane and tucked it under the seat during the flights.I do recommend practicing attaching and removing a few times before travel. Also ask for it to be hand inspected when going through security so it can stay attached saving time. Do not hang anything on the handle as you could possibly break or damage it which would not be good during the stress of travel. If it is used according to the simple instructions this product delivers what it is intended for perfectly."
5,"Easy to Use, Rolls great! Wonderful!","This item is great. It's super easy to assemble, snaps on in a flash, and the wheels roll so nice and smooth. The adjustable height on the handle makes it great also that both my husband and I can push/pull the car seat and not have to bend awkwardly."
1,not what i expected,"I ordered this product and when I receive it I noticed that my car seat model was not listed on the box, but it was listed on the website. After carefully looking at the box, I realized that they had sent me the European version which listed the European car seat models. I was very disappointed to have received the wrong product."
2,Doesn't fit all the car seats.,I was disappointed that when we got the stroller and where trying to put it together it broke. I was concerned that if it broke while putting it together what will happen when we had our baby in it. So we are returning it.
1,Wanted to leave it in a flaming heap by the side of the road...,".... but local fire code prevented me. We borrowed this from a friend for a trip. Traveling with car seats is frustrating enough without having the seat constantly slipping down off the roller. Essentially, I ended up dragging the car seat by the handle and cannot count the number of f-bombs I had to swallow while using this thing. We bought the JL Childress wheeled car seat travel bag for the other car seat. It held up well, and by the end of the trip I just piled the other car seat on top of it.Edited to add: Thank you to the commenters who asked for clarification. The problem was that the car seat (Britax) slipped off constantly. I read the instructions carefully, and I'm typically able to figure out and use baby gear without trouble, so I don't think it was me. Hope that helps."
5,Life saver!,I was traveling by myself with two small children and this cart was a life saver! It is a must for anyone traveling with a baby and car seat!
2,European!,THis version is the European version and does not fit with a britax marathon 70. Read everything before purchasing!! I couldn't find anywhere in the description that said this and didn't find out until we assembled it and realized the wheels did not work with our car seat. I like the concept but will have to find the right wheels! Maybe call amazOn to confirm before purchasing? They have good customer service.
3,Travelmate not so good for travel!,"The concept is a good idea but in reality there are faults to this product. It attaches to the car seat and stays attached as long as you are rolling the product, as soon as you lift it to place it in a car, or up stairs, it comes off the wheels. It needs additional attachments to hold the carseat onto the travelmate. As many travels know the airport only want quick, they don't like waiting for you to reattach your wheels to the carseat after it goes through security. Fellow travelers don't want to wait while you reattach the carset to the wheels after it comes off the transport bus. So I would not buy this again unless they fix these faults."
4,GREAT! just noticed one minor flaw,"Great lightweight pruduct, easy to use and a great helper when passing around at the airport..One minor flaw that I noticed is that the release for the handles are to loose..I wish it was either located on the side or not as easy to relase the handle..A few times I accidently pressed the button and the handles went down a few notches. Other than that, my child thought it was fun being pushed around, and it made life a bit easier for us all."
5,BEST SOLUTION EVER!,"People can not stop commenting and staring as I walk down the airport hualing my suitcase and my child in her carseat behind me with ease! I get so many questions as to where I bought this and how it works. This even allowed me to take the car seat off the plane, sleeping child and all, and continue her nap through the airport to our next plane. So light weight that even my 2 1/2 yr old can pull her own carseat behind her through the airport for entertainment during layovers. Can't think of a single item I would reccomend more to parents."
3,"Only product available, but not that great","We bought the go-go kidz travelmate because it is pretty much the only thing available to allow you to travel with a toddler carseat. It was difficult to manuever. It did not fit through most of the airplane aisles. I had to carry the carseat, the diaper bag, and my toddler making it for an interesting trip. Also, the wheel popped off when we took it out of the taxi! However, there are really no other products available to allow you to take a toddler seat with you when you travel."
4,Worthwhile Investment,"We used two of these with our two year old twins recently and had a generally pleasant experience. It's a breeze wheeling your kids around the airport. When our kids were not in their carseats they loved pushing them around the airport. We had no trouble getting through security, they fit through the X-ray machines with the wheels attached. TSA will also do hand inspection if you request it. The only minor problem was getting the seat attached while on the plane. There is not much room to maneuver the seat belts through the back. Our flight attendant said we could not use seat belt extenders with carseats. If your airline still pre-boards, take advantage of it so your not working up a sweat trying to get your carseats belted in. I also think it makes sense to slip the wheels off when securing on the airplane. If we were only traveling with one toddler, I don't think it would be worth the expense, but with two, it makes all the difference."
2,It finally works with extra measures,"This travelmate finally works and it is not easy on and easy off....at least not for the Evenflo Triumph carseat that I have. The platform the seat rests near or on is slight. The straps that are included do not hold the seat securely to the rolling plate. We would have it all attached and the seat would fall off the edge of the slight platform as soon as we lifted the handle. We finally went out and bought a tarp strap and laced it in through the seat belt holes of the carseat and were able to cinch it in place. We then used a couple of the pieces included with the travelmate and finally the seat was able to hold my 33 pound child without us fearing that the seat was going to fall to the ground. The best piece of equipment that came with this was the handle itself. With the push of the button, the handle lifts to 2-3 different heights. I gave it 2 stars because of the time and effort that must be taken to work with the Triumph 5 carseat."
1,"good idea, not practical","We didn't want to spend over $200 for other systems that function as a car seat and stroller so we opted for this travelmate even though it was still overpriced for a little plastic and 2 wheels. Anyhow, it was very difficult to manage with a not so happy 2 yo in the airport. It ended up simply being another carry-on. My son never used it as a stroller. We should have spent $2 on a bungee cord and attached the car seat to rolling luggage. Great idea but not practical."
5,Great! Great! Great! Just remove the wheels!,"I love this thing. It made flying with my 20 month old much easier. All you have to do is simply remove the wheels very easily.To go through security you have to remove the wheels, just the wheels. You don't have to unscrew the whole thing. It fits. You can attach it to the airplane and car seat too just by removing the wheels and leaving the rest of it attached.We love it and will use it again and again!"
2,Great Idea but doesn't live up to expectations,"This product was purchased for our Britax Marathon 70 car seat to use on trips. I was excited upon finding this product and hoped for it to be as useful as I imagined. It worked out great on our trip to Puerto Rico however, the wheel was bent by the last leg of the trip and the plastic backing was cracked. I was traveling with a 21 pound baby in the car seat so it was not too much extra weight compared to traveling with a toddler in the seat. I was so disappointed that the backing cracked. My grandfather who is a welder ended up fixing the bent rod (thank goodness) however now it is permanently cracked unless I use super glue to fix. it was an expensive product that did not live up to 1 full airplane trip. I was hoping to use if for many more to come."
2,Bars failed,"Pros:Easy to use, assemble, and unassemble.Came with new strap which makes to easy to attach and detach car seat - we have the Maxi-Cosi Priori car seat and fits perfectly.Lightweight.Rolls easily with our 30 pound kid plus car seat.Comfy and secure.Handle has multiple heights - Im 6'1'' and no issues with height of handle when rolling.Cons:Only lasted on trip due to the bars bending from the car seat being attached, which prevented the handle from being able to retract, WHAT A PAIN.It wont fit in most small plane overhead bins (Delta Embraer 170/190; probably OK for Southwest(all 737s).I had to return it due to bars denting from car seat and handles wouldnt retract. Bars need to be heavier/thicker where top of seat sits against them."
2,I tried to love it.,"I was so happy to get the GoGoKidz Travelmate. We had grand ideas to use it for a trip to CA, through airports, in and out of cabs, at train stations and various grandparent visits across the country.But after the first 2 uses, one of the wheels fell off. And we put it back on, and kept using it. And it kept falling off. And we kept using it.Then, on one visit to grandma's house we realized we forgot it, and would need to haul the car seat around a train station. In a pinch we used one of those cheap collapsing luggage racks (the kind with the bungee that goes over the luggage and a telescoping handle). And low and behold, it was a miracle. It was so easy to steer, light weight, assembled and disassembled easily, and nothing fell off!If you get one that works, good for you. But if you have one of those cheap, collapsing luggage racks, save your money."
2,Not as great as advertised!,"I bought this for as we were travelling extensively overseas for over a months and needed to take a car seat for our 18 months old daughter. I had to travel 2 legs with her by myself with this thing and by the second time I was ready to throw it out the window. This is an item you want to test in the store with your specific car seat. The ledge the car seat sits on in tiny and the slightest bump or movement can get it out of alignment which means you have to take the little one out and put it on again. It is almost impossible (unlike advertised) to do it with the baby in it when you are by yourself. It's to heavy and bulky. Maybe it works better with other car seats but if you have a Britax Marathon, DON'T waste your money on this. It created more hassle than it was worth. Also, it doesn't fit through all air plane aisles which again, when you are travelling alone with the little one, creates a whole new set of challenges!"
1,Broke during first use...,Latch broke off from the strap after going through security at the airport first time we used it. Had to use some packing tape from TSA to hold it together for the remainder of the trip. Won't be able to use it again. Waste of money...
1,Seriously poor design,"This device is basically a set of wheels and a handle which you attach to your infant car seat. The first version would not easily fit through x-ray machines so they came out with a version with ""removable wheels"". The problem is that the removable wheels are always falling off at the most inconvenient times. This poor design is combined with the ridiculous price makes this product a waste of time and money."
4,Great product,"We bought the Go Go Kidz to go with our Britax Marathon. We recently flew to Europe and it was just perfect. Our son loved being in his car seat at the airport and we loved not having to drag around a stroller on top of everything else.It's a little bit of a pain to attach, but once you get the hang of it, it only takes a minute. Your car seat with the Go Go Kidz might not fit through the security scanner. Don't stress yourself and just ask for it to be hand scanned. Depending on the airport they will hand scan it or have a huge oversized item scanner somewhere.We got a lot of looks and actually met another Go Go Kidz owner at our gate in Stuttgart, Germany. It's taking over the world!"
5,Mommy's Must-have for Travel,"I purchased two of these (a friend's recommendation) for a trip to Maui. Although it was a direct flight, the idea of chasing my 3.5 year old and 1.5 year old around the airport was enough to give me a headache. Also, the kids had their own seats and we were bringing their car seats aboard. The Travelmates were worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY. The kids' car seats attached easily and we literally rolled them through the airport, security, and to the gate. They were securely buckled in to their own familiar seat and my daughter even called the rolling around ""a ride"". The handles have different height adjustments to work for short or tall people and there is literally one strap that locks in the seat. They couldn't be any easier to use. Also, they fold down easily and store in the overhead compartment on the plane. LOVE LOVE LOVE the Travelmate, I think I could have sold at least five to other moms/dads who all asked me about them."
5,amazing travel help!,"I bought this to take my 2 year old on her first plane ride with a carseat. It was so easy to use and manuever. I was a little worried at first because of the reviews I read where it fell apart on people, but I thought it was great. No issues at all. I definately recommend this for anyone traveling with a carseat."
4,I loved it,I loved it it made traveling soo easy...the only thing that I had a problem with is my carseat was to wide to go down the coach isle so he just had to follow me and I carry it over my head....but oing thru the airport with out a stroller was nice!
2,Not good at all!,This was good in theory but not in execution. Here we are walking through the airport when Bam! it falls apart! I wished we would have just gotten a stroller!
1,New Model Has Difficult To Use Strap,"For the high price, this product seems to be made very cheaply. The plastic is flimsy, the handle is not sturdy, and the new strap is poorly designed with a buckle that doesn't release.I bought this for an upcoming plane trip, tested it two-nights prior and decided it would be easier to CARRY the car seat instead of using this product. That's how poor it is. With the strap system, it is so difficult to remove the car seat that I couldn't imagine doing it several times at the airport as needed (out of the car, at security, on the plane, deboarding, etc)."
4,What I Wish I Knew...,"I would buy this product again. Getting through airplane terminals, alone, with a 30 lbs toddler was well worth this purchase. Having our familiar Britax Boulevard on the flights helped my guy relax and sleep and made getting out non-negotiable. Most importantly, we had our Britax carseat for safety at both ends of our journey.However, getting the attached Britax Boulevard (it is a heavy seat) through jet aisles is not possible with the Gogo Kidz. It had to be detached and reattached at each boarding and unboarding. Practice the threading of the strap ahead of time and use a metallic marker if you need a quick reminder arrow like I did (mechanically not inclined). Hope this information helps another safe toddler and sane parent.Highly recommend this Travelmate that is so durable that we joked about it being made of Kryptonite."
4,Good but need some improvement,"When we used the this travelmate first time, my husband unscrewed the carseat from the travel mate in the airplane seat. One screw fell off under the seat and we could not find it. At the end of the flight, we found it. In the last international flight, since my child is big enough not using the carseat in the plane, we checked in the travelmate with carseat on it on the gate. When we got it again, one travelmate's screw was ripped off with a piece from the plastic plate. The travelmate cannot be used anymore. We like the travelmate since it really convenient not to carry our child around in the airport during a long international flight and we can ""tie"" him on the seat when we are checking the luggage it."
3,Strap Locks Up,"I have no idea why this costs so much, but it is really helpful, especially when travelling with multiple babies/toddlers. The strap works kind of like the strap on a ski boot but sometimes locks up. Sometimes I leave the whole thing attached to my Britax on the plane so that I don't have to fumble with it when trying to deplane for a connection. If you do this, definitely use a seatbelt extender so that when you tighten the belt you will still be able to reach and release the metal lever. A mechanic had to cut the fabric belt to get mine out."
5,Awesome.,"We love this unit. Do not travel without. Fits great with our Britax seat, not sure about others. Our daugther turns 3 in May, expect to have it for quite awhile. Only negative, yes, with the unit and seat attached...it will not fit under/through airports scanners. But takes only moments to put back on."
1,Broke the 1st time it was used. Total pain all around.,"I was so excited to use this product. The concept is wonderful, however, this product sucks. We have a Graco Alpha Omega Elite car seat that would not stay on to save a life. The straps didn't tighten as well as they needed to get a tight enough grasp. I had to constantly stop and readjust because the seat would fall off of the little shelf. I thought I was doing something wrong but after 3 bright and competent adults read the directions and tried it themselves, it was still pretty unstable. That's not all, the wheels popped off while I was wheeling her through the airport and a piece slid away never to be seen again deeming this a complete and total failure.I have found something much cheaper that actually WORKS. Get a little luggage dolly (you know the ones you see airline stewardesses/pilots pulling around) and a couple of bungee chords. BOOM 25 dollar alternative that actually works."
5,Life Saver!,"I used this product on our trip with two yound children, so we actually have two of the gogo kidz. You can remove the quick-release wheels to run it throught the xray machine or ask the security to hand wand the travelmate and car seat if they can. If you need to unattach the gogo kidz travelmatee from the car seat for security, just unscrew one side and slip the strap through the back of the car seat. This took one minute. This product saved us time and stress on our trip and I would definitely tell everyone who is considering buying one that it is worth the investment and few extra minutes. You can leave it attached on the plane seat with your car seat, just ask for a seat belt extender."
4,Great little carseat helper,This product was great for transporting our heavy Britax carseat and also for keeping my son in it while we waited in line to check - in etc. It's kind of a pain to screw and unscrew it on and off when you go through security but that is the only pain in the butt. It's a good product and much cheaper than the sit and stroll which we purchased and didn't like at all.
3,traveling with car seat,works great as a stroller when you have to travel with car seat.Kind of a pain to unscrew from car seat but wheels come off really easy
2,Worst Asaro ever,I'm an Asaro fan couldn't get behind this book if you like Asaro you probably wont like this book. This book actually annoyed me and made me realise that even a great writer can write absolute garbage sometimes.
5,One Day at a Time journal,"I've bought many journals. This is the first one I kept coming back to and actually writing in. The lined pages are easy to write on and yet are faint enough, not to distract from the beauty of the words.One of the nicer features is an elasitic band attached to the back cover. It makes it easy to mark the last page you've written on. A feature, I have not seen in other journals.I only wish there was a series of journals made in the same pattern as this one. I'm considering buying several. The wisdom written on every other page or so, is great."
1,"Vapid, tepid, insipid...","...well, how many synonyms for boring are there? Central character is a cardboard cutout, dull man, with trivial problems. His family is the only thing less interesting than he is in the book. And the plot is even worse...weird without being in the least bit interesting. The whole time warp/dual identity/meditation on Civil War never comes close to liftoff. The author has some minor talent for dialogue and description but smothers the few decent passages by overwriting everything. I could not finish it. Gave up after 150 pages and left it in a motel room and went for a walk through downtown Columbus, Georgia instead of reading another word, which should give you some idea of what a dud this is if you have ever been there."
4,Definitely not for the faint of heart!,"I'm giving this a four star because it was a little slow getting in the beginning, but once it got started, wow! This was definitely a book written for the shock factor and I, for one, love that! The character development could have been stronger. I don't feel like I knew too much about the main characters -- er victims -- but again, once it got into full swing, that mattered less.It's a story about a group of wild cannibals living in a cave on the coast of Maine in a wooded secluded area. A young woman editor decided to rent a cabin in the woods nearby to do some work and possibly try her hand at a novel. But first, she decided to have friends up for a visit. The visit didn't last long, because the cannibals knew they were there and they were hungry. If you don't like gory stories, I'd stop reading here. Otherwise, hold on. It's a fast, bumpy ride."
2,Couldn't hold my attention,"I bought this book based on the reviews and I was expecting to be scared and grossed out by it but I was actually kind of bored. Maybe its because the book is alittle dated and I am alittle desensitized but I didn't think it was up to todays ""gross out"" standards, atleast in my opinion."
4,Ketchum at his best,Easily one of the most brutal books I have read. I did read the version that was unbutchered by the editors. The pace was fast and easily read in a day. I do not cringe at gore and in some books I feel gore is placed just for the shock value and does not add to the pleasure of the story. I do not feel that was the case here. I feel that the brutality envisioned was necessary to explain the intense circumstances these people were placed in. The story does place doubt in my mind to whether I will stop to help a lone kid on an empty country road!
5,horror great,if you enjoy horror books then you won't be disapointed in off season. i had never read anything like it before. i was looking around every corner i was so jumpy when reading it. only the sequel offspring was as good. absolutely a must for horror book lovers. mr ketchum never seems to leave you in the lurch only wanting more and more.
3,Good~ Not as good as I thought it was going to be,"I was very excited to read ""off season"" due to all the hype I had read about it. To tell you the truth it was just OK~ It kinda dragged in places, especially when the local sheriff was involved. I totally hated the ending when not all make it out ( won't spoil it for those that have not read it yet) The crazies were described very good~ Totally sick! Other than that it was just ok~ My 2 cents"
4,A Great Introduction to climate change(s),"Read this book if you are at all interested in climate change, evolution and the forces that gave rise to modern civilized life."
2,Stickers are tiny,Yes there are 90 stickers in this package but be aware that they are tiny!!! The stickers are cute but a lot smaller than I expected them to be.
5,"Great, heart-warming story.","I bought my copy for one of my gradschool teachers. Years earlier I had read the book myself. The story is very well written. I remember that after I had read the book for the first time, I felt melancholy and wished I didn't have to say ""goodbye"" to the character! Buy the book!"
1,Extension Arm Cooper,"The Cooper extension arm advertised on Amazon does not fit. In fact Cooper does not make an extension arm to fit its GT 100MH Metal Halide fixture. This info would have been helpful before hand in some literature some place, rather than having to track down someone at Cooper and to get an engineer to reveal this."
4,this took too long to come so it is still in the box,I mistakenly ordered this after the light fixture by one or two days but it took nearly a week to arrive. IT is still in the box because the fixture got put up without it. it was my fault I know
2,didn't work for me,"my doctor recommended this product... i applied it and nothing... i was warned there would be much burning... i felt nothing... since it didn't burn i forgot about and 12 hrs later went to bed, with my electric blanket... then came the burn.. now it does state not to use a heatpad with the product... but to burn when under a eletric blanket 12 hrs after application.. hmmmm... i am glad it works for some but for me nothing... if you have a high tolerance for pain relief meds.. i don't recommend this product..."
1,Capzasin often causes intense lasting pain,"This product is can cause intense skin pain that can take hours to go away. It is surprising that it is sold without warnings about this. I don't mean it causes transient burning, I mean it causes lasting pain that will not stop even if you wash it off. The first time it worked ok, but on a different area it started to burn, skin turned red, and the pain wouldn't go away with repeated washing. Other web sites said that Aloe vera can help but we didn't have any (calamine lotion helped a little)."
1,Pretty much pepper spray in a bottle,This is by far the worse product that I ever bought. The solution once applied burns your skin and last the entire night. Once you wake up while the burn is gone the pain is worse than before. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,avoid this product!,"My husband had been using this product for lower back pain. After a month and a half of severe coughing, sneezing, and watering eyes, we finally figured out that this product becomes airborn after it dries on the skin. Everyone in my family was sick from it, and my husband's laundry had to be placed in a plastic bag and kept separate. Our whole apartment became a coughing nightmare. After we figured out that it was the Capzasin, the problem instantly was resolved when he stopped using the product. This product is really a hazard- it should be taken off the market or at the very least reformulated."
1,Very dissapointing,"It said it was going to be like new but the cover was creased, and ther was a TON of highlighting all over the book, i was very dissapointed when it arrived."
1,The Plane that Wouldn't Fly,"I ordered two of these airplanes for my grandsons to play with at the park. We never got them to fly properly. The materials used are not worth the cost. I wouldn't order this again. When they crashed, pieces fell off."
5,My First Flying Toy,"The Guillows Jetfire Glider was my very first flying toy, back in 1954. This is what started my love for flying toys! It was/is simple to assemble and fly. Trim is simple, just breath on the wing, rudder or elevator to soften and gently bend. After 6 decades of flying everything, I can still enjoy tossing a Jetfire glider."
2,Where did you come up with the 90$ value?,You can buy these at the Dollar store for about a dollar but yes they are fun.
3,Beware,THE SERVICE WAS FAST. THE DVD WAS DISAPPOINTING. THERE IS MAYBE 20 PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHICH IS PROBABLY AT A FREE CONCERT. IT LOOKED LIKE A BOOTLEG THAT HAD BEEN RUN OFF SOMEONES PC WITH A PHOTOCOPIED JACKET. UNSURE WHY IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE AT $50.00. NOW WE KNOW WHY.
1,Broke on my first try,"The geared center column broke the first time I took it out and gave it a test set-up. For warranty service they want a receipt (which I don't have because it was a gift), then they want you to send it to them on your own dime as well as paying $7.50 for them to ship it back to you. So I'd be paying a third the cost of the tripod to get a repaired/refurbished unit back and hope that one lasts. With a 1:1 failure rate that doesn't seem like a good bet.Seemed slick at first (for all of five minutes) but the plastic parts feel flimsy, and given my experience I expect they are.The carry handle is cute, but if you go to the next tier in tripod price/quality they generally throw in a carry bag which you can sling over your shoulder. That would be much handier if you want to carry the tripod any significant distance, or take freehand shots with your camera along the way."
5,Great Tripod,"I have a very light weight camera, a Panasonic Lumix, but I wanted a rock solid tripod that wouldn't cost me more than the camera, for taking videos and stills, especially at lower shutter speeds. I have found it to be rock solid, very quick to setup and adjust and put away. It has some very nice features, like quick snap locks for the leg extensions, a solid base, a level bubble incorporated into the tripod, it locks quickly on all the axes, and has a removable plate that screws into the camera tripod screw socket so the camera can be attached to or removed from the tripod instantly. I am extremely pleased with this tripod. I couldn't be happier."
1,"horrible, waste of time!",This movie was so bad! It don't even deserve a star at all! I would not recommend this movie to anyone!
5,When the blood falls in the city!,Detroit Blood City is another so bad its good film from Silver Bullet Pictures. I own this film and I had it signed at the last convention the SBP crew was at!Can't wait to see more form them
3,Lands of the German Empire,"I was disappointed with a couple of things about this book. I was most disappointed with the maps, which are a selling point of the book. There are a lot of maps, but very few contextual features are shown, such as rivers, cities, major highways, or adjoining countries. The maps are black and white, not in color, and not shaded. As a result, most of the maps are of marginal value. The book could be improved by doing a better job of formatting. The most annoying formatting problem is that the textual information pertaining to a map was not on the facing page but on the prior page, so frequent page flipping was required. There is quit a bit of useful information in the book, but finding it could be easier if it were organized better.I am cutting the author some slack with my 3-star rating because I know that sources for maps of that era are hard to come by. However, if I had seen the book first, I would not have purchased it."
5,Addictive!,"This game is by far one of the best strategy games I have played in a LONG time! I have spent HOURS playing and can't wait to play more. It's like sims meets risk, they really did a great job on this game. If you like strategy, turn based games, you will love this title."
2,Game is fun but the copy protection renders it unplayable,"After getting addicted to Civilization Revolution on my iPhone, I decided to get the real Civ for my netbook. The price was right for Civ3 and it required less horsepower than Civ4, so I went for it. I had to use an external CD/DVDROM drive for my Asus to install it under WinXP.At first, all was great because I still had the CD-ROM drive attached. But then when I removed it to go for a trip, Civ3 suddenly stopped working. Turns out you need the original disk installed in your CD/DVD-ROM drive in order for the game to work.This makes Civ3 utterly useless for the netbook crowd since our drives aren't built in and many of us don't carry it along. Bummer.Great game. Lousy copy protection."
3,Civilization 2?,"With the exception of embassies and some small combat graphics, not much different that Civ 2. An engrossing game if you aren't burnt out from the older ones."
5,Good Game,"Hadn't played this game in ages. So I figured I would get this one after playing Civilization Revolution on the XBox 360. Though I forgot how freaking hard it is at times. I love the game, but can easily get my butt handed to me cause of the interface difference."
1,DANGER - SecuROM,"I installed and enjoyed this game, until I found my USB CD/DVD combo drive wouldn't work, then my IE browser started crashing, and soon after I realized that this game installed SecuROM v7 on my PC. I am not impressed. I completely uninstalled the game, but could not get rid of SecuROM. I still get requests to register Civ3 Complete when I logon to my PC, even though it's uninstalled, and my drive is still not functioning, and IE is still crashing. There is no warning on the box anywhere that SecuROM is on it - I NEVER would have purchased or installed it had I been aware. The only solution now is to reformat my entire drive and install the o/s from scratch. The game itself I would rate 4 stars, but the SecuROM b.s. ruined my experience."
1,Saturday Night Live skit.,"GOD: Hello.SETTLER: Hi.GOD: Settle a city.SETTLER: I wanna move another turn.GOD: Well, then you'll have to wait for another 250 years.EMPEROR: Oh, I'm in debt. Let me go to cheat mode.GOD: Cheaters never prosper.EMPEROR: But I have to sell another of my city's improvements every 25 years!GOD: Cheaters never prosper.I mean the above monologue to be PROPHETIC of the game."
1,disappointing at the least,"after all the reviews, i was looking forward to a good graphics game. i though i was back in the early 80's. i kept waiting for a space invader to pop out. premise is good, build and conquer, but thats where it stops. have been playing rome:total war and was looking for its equal or better. this ain't it.. not even close. also after playing railroad tycoon 3 vs locomotion, ill never buy another sid meier game. thought about buying pirates, ill stay with port royale. the 1 star rating is only because i had to put at least 1 in for the review. save your money."
1,can't play,Newly purchases CIV 3 Complete was installed on newely recieved exchange pc for my hp Oavillion on which ieasily played cciv3 Gold and Conquests.replacemen per warrantee from Best Buy is a Gateway 507 GR does not play Civ 3 and conquests. I gave Civ 3 and conqeest to my niece who now enjoys them on her emachine. I purchased Civ3 complete assuming as it was a newer product any dificulty wihth the cheap intel chipsets Best Buy and Gateway are providing woulld have been worked out. in stead I have a brand new product on a lemon of a pc and can get no satisfaction from Best Buy or Gateway or Atari.
2,Long-term Civ Fan,"I have played every Civ in existence and am playing the CivWorlds as an Alpha/Closed Beta tester, so I have a bit of experience with the series. So when I say Civ III is the single most irritating iteration of the Civilization series, I know what I am talking about. The game itself is mediocre at best, even if you like the style of gameplay it seems to force you into. Recommend either Civ2, Alpha Centauri, or Civ5, all three much better games."
1,No Read,"Discs wouldn't read in my computer, so basically a waste of money on my part. I've not ruled out that it is my computer, and have yet to try them in another computer."
1,Pirated?,"It came with 3 set-up discs, which was a red flag. All other versions of Civilization came with just one, except the original. After going through with the set-up process there was a prompt to insert ""original disc."" None of the 3 discs given satisfied this prompt. The game cannot be played without the disc, so all you get is a full set-up and no way to play the game."
5,always great,civ games are always great games when my old one was worn out to point i could no longer play it i had to find another copy glad that games such as this continue to exist
1,did not work,when i got this game i had been looking for it for over a year and then i got it in the mail and i didnt work i would never try to buy a game from here ever again but the rest of the stuff is the best...now i have tryed buying this game here twice now and the first time wasnt what i paid for and this time it didnt work....
5,The best strategy game ever!,I really enjoy this game and it is one of my all time favorite video games ever it may be old but i still love this game i think this game is way better then civ 4 the only thing about this game is its not for every one u need lots of game experience and lots of patience onte time i spent over thity hours on one game unfortunately my computer broke and it was lost forever and i was never able to finish it. i give this game a five star rating!
3,"Highly addicting, great for travel.","This game is addicting, as all Civ games have been. However, the biggest flaw, and rather important, is that battles play out the same way per turn. That is, if you battle, then reload game, the battle will be the same, unless you have other battles, or wait for next turn. It makes the game feel quite ridgid. Otherwise, the game is very good, and great for long travel, as time gets lost easily."
3,"alright, but not without its issues","I can't beleive i blew that much money on the Civ3 collection, thinking i would save more money, only to find that if I got Civ3 and Conquests, I'd be good. Also, the computer's AI is insane. It makes more illegal moves than I do on a boring session. Since I couldn't take Civ3 back or sell it, I gave it away in excahnge for some books. I still love my Civ2:Test of Time edition. That I don't mind so much. Even tho Civ3 does come away with major improvements, the game should not be that difficult. Also, I miss my sci-fi and fantasy elements... I am not planning on buying Civ4 or any other title afterwards given what's being presented now... Also, I just can't run those games on my Windows98 machine (tho it does have pentium3 processor and 128 of ram, it's just too slow)."
4,Misleading,"The game that arrived was not in the packaging shown on the page that I purchased it on. It is not even an authentic game. It came from some company called ""Sold Out"" out of the UK and had nothing with it other than the three CD's. No books or maps or anything else that should have been there. I know it was cheap but let's not deceive."
4,More Scenarios,"I have enjoyed Civ from the beginning. The Civ3 scenarios are excellent. They give the flavor of the different periods and a good sense of history. however there are some scenarios in Civ2 that are not available in Civ3 that I am aware of and I keep hoping they will show up. The American Revolution, the American Civil War, WWI (even if it is only the European and Mediterranean theaters, and WWII European, Mediterranean and North African theaters. Make no mistake the scenarios available in Civ3 are excellent, ancient Mediterranean, ancient Japan, medieval, Napoleonic and the World War2 Pacific Campaign are all great. I'm sure there are some scenarios that I have left out. You can see those that I play most often."
5,Very Good Game,"This is a somewhat complex game that I am just beginning to figure out. Since I am an old guy and not quite up to speed on modern technology and gaming systems, I was nervous about buying this. However, since there are newer generations of this game, I got it for a very modest price (under $10). I have already spent hours on it and enjoy it more and more as I understand the numerous options and decisions that must be made. It is like the board game Risk times 1000! I would highly recommend it to anyone who has the time to play (each game takes hours) and is willing to take the time to read the manual with the patience to figure out how to play. I am not there yet but getting better all the time!"
5,A classic not only for Muslims!,"A real classic to be own,excellent production.Only a pity wihout subtitles.Comes with 2 disc,one in English and the other in Arabic...wonderful!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I had really hoped this item would provide some insight into the Live Aid and Live 8 concert events as it was produced by a reputable news orgagnization. What I got was a 14 page pamphlet with a small number of pictures from the events and very little text or information about either event. This item is a true waste of paper, you money and your time. If you are looking for information about the Live Aid events I would suggest visiting liveaiddvd.com or thelive8concert.com You may also consider searching for newpapers on or around the 13th of July 1985. I would steer clear of this item."
5,Soothing,"I'm listening to it right now and the CD is excellent. It's great for background music or relaxation. I must say, the Ella Fitzgerald-Louis Armstrong rendition of ""Summertime"" is incredible and it truly is one of the best on the CD. Also, Diana Krall being on the album is interesting, since she is a modern-day artist ahead of her time. Or, behind her time, I suppose .. whichever, it is truly an honor for her to be put on the CD along with such excellent artists like Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong. Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone."
1,Another pitiful bratz product,This is just another product that bratz makes that is worthless. I bought this for my 6 year old daughter. We hooked it up on Christmas day and she tried to play with it but lost interest almost immediately. It is very hard to play because the areas where you place your foot are very small and difficult to hit. The music is just as bad as the graphics. Don't waste your money on this product.
1,Junk......,"Not worth the $$$ we spent, total crap. My daughter tried to play it once and besides being too fast for her to keep up its confusing. I sold it in a garage sale for 2 bucks.....save your money !!!!"
4,brat dance mat,"I was really glad I chose this particular item for my neice for christmas, she plays with it almost everyday! What a great fundamental , as well as exercise activity for a young child. The Bratz Stylin' Dance Mat Fun on TV Game has great hip-hop funky tunes for her to groove too, and it was very easy to attach to the television!"
2,Seed of Life - Radmilla Cody,"Radmilla Cody's performance does not measure up to the hype. If you bought her first album, just replay it and you will have heard her second release, ""Seed of Life."""
2,it's ok,I've seen the one in english and its ok. its not worse the price the sell it for. If you want action it is great to say that this is not the movie for you. Help this growth on my belly is getting bigger. Oh yea I'm having your baby!
5,Just what I needed,They are just what I wanted and more.They are great dishes and at a great price.I was suprized to see that I got a mix of colors I really wanted without asking for them.
4,Versátil e agradável,"O título de minha resenha procura definir bem esse CD. Marcella Pobbe foi um dos grandes sopranos líricos italianos da década de 50 (uma voz límpida, agradabilíssima) e praticamente concentrou a carreira em seu país de origem, ficando pouco conhecida e até esquecida fora dele. Nesse Cd podemos ouvi-la em um repertório eclético que vai de Rossini: Guilherme Tell à Wagner: Lohengrin. Sua voz lírica era ampla, flexível, canta maravilhosamente a Desdmona (pena que aqui encontramos apenas a Ave Maria), Leonora e Amélia; e surpreende pelo lirismo na ária do sonho de Elsa em Lohengrin (cantada em italiano, para os puristas um terror, mas um costume comum para a época). Uma pena que as faixas finais, sua Condessa e sua Donna Anna, sejam to ruidosas."
2,MNCook,"Disappointing. Healthy Choice is usually great - this was doughy and had a very cloudy, flouring taste to the broth. Hardly any veggies."
3,"It's chicken in a can, dented cans...","I'm a big fan of having Amazon deliver me boxes of soup cans. This is the third time I've ordered Healthy Choice soup, and the running issue is that some of the cans are always dented. A couple severely, to the point where I am not comfortable eating them (the treated lining inside can get torn if the can is dented enough, and you're not supposed to eat it.)Aside from the denting, I'm a fan. Like I said. Chicken and dumplings are my favorite, my only overarching complaint being that the stuff sputters and pops in the microwave and makes a huge mess. Aggravating. I also had a one off issue with one can leaving a horrible taste in my mouth that I couldn't shake off all day.But again, almost all good."
3,"Not bad, watching my salt,",I liked this product. It's a little bland so I add a pinch of pepper and it's fine for me.
3,its ok chicken is good,Like the fact that it isnt too salty. Chicken is legit as is the dumplings for a canned soup. I'd buy again. Don't expect miracles here.
1,taste bad and messy,Worst of healthy choice soup. Taste so so and everything are melt in a messy way.
1,Healthy Choice Chicken Dumplings Soup,"Healthy Choice Chicken Dumplings Soup. TRUST ME, This soup is HORRIBLE. Does not taste like any soup I've Ever tasted. No Chicken Flavor. Taste more like the metal can. Vegetables are hard. Heating the soup longer won't make the vegetables softer. Dumplings are more like a flour ball, no flavor. I'll never buy healthy choice again. Zero Stars."
5,For the sake of the children,"Like book one, this story is set in the rich atmosphere of historical Philadelpia. In essence it's one lonely woman's search for love, but it's so much more than that. Her answers come from places she never expected, while she rediscovers the worth of the faith she abandoned. Her determination do do something about the heart-rending plight of the street children is a true pleasure to read and makes this a lovely story of big-heartedness. Highly recommended."
3,"For Du Pre Fans Only, Not Her Definitive Cello Sonatas","This first time CD issue has been released to much fanfare, but it is really only for Du Pre fans. These are not the famous studio performances that have been most recently issued on an EMI Double Forte along with her classic recordings of Chopin and Franck. Instead these are mono performances from 1968 recorded by Christopher Nupen, and released to accompany his documentary film on Du Pre. As for the Bruch, well, let's just say Barenboim has always been hit or miss for me as a conductor, and here it's a miss. For Du Pre completists this disc is a must, for those looking for a great rendition of Brahms' Cello Sonatas, get the Starker/Sebok on Mercury Living Presence (see my review), either the Sony or RCA recordings by Ax and Ma, or the aforementioned Du Pre/Barenboim EMI Double Forte."
5,Amazing,"To begin with, I'm not the biggest Brahms fan on earth, and I approach any release by a British artist reluctantly after having been burnt by many Gramophone reviews, which favor the English like NBA refs treat the Lakers at Staples Center. Add to that my uneasiness in paying full price for a mono recording. BUT... I can't resist playing this album, and have played it nearly every day since I purchased it a month ago. It easily outshines the Ma/Ax version that has collected dust on my shelf for a decade. DuPre and Barenbouim reveal a complete otherness in Brahms, much like Argerich does for Chopin."
1,Hopeless,This is one of the worst handheld vaccum I have come across. Not powerful not efficient. You would be better of buying a broom!
1,sadly dissappointed,Can't really comment on how the product works since I am sadly dissappointed that I didn't receive my product before Christmas when it was ordered before Thanksgiving... :(
3,Liked the older one better!,"This dust buster picks up good, however the holding space is so much smaller than the last one we had. Will keep it, but now I know!"
3,Just okay,"I got this for our basement. One reason why I chose it is because we've had an old Black and Decker that has worked consistently for about 10 years. Therefore I expected that this would be the upgraded version of the old one. One change, having the AccuREACH is both good and bad. It is nice to reach under furniture, but it also makes the opening altogether smaller. Since I'm mostly vacuuming up popcorn, this means that full kernels no longer fit and I have to smash them to get them sucked up. Also the suction seems less than my old version. You would think with a more powerful motor and a smaller opening the suction would have increase, but no. Otherwise, the vacuum is little changed from its predecessor which makes it....just okay."
2,not so great,this one burnt out on me within 6 months. i've been through 3 black & decker hand vacs in less that 2 years of moderate use... giving up & trying another brand
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"We all make mistakes and mine was not trying this unit out right away and returning it within the time allowed. This is my third and final black and decker vacuum. They all wither and die, and this one although not dead yet, is the worst of the bunch. Very low power even when left plugged in to charge. The extension nozzle (or 'accureach' as they call it, gets readily clogged at the slightest provocation. But the main complaint is the lack of suction power and low motor speed. It is a real pain to clean out the nozzel when it gets clogged; you end up with more dust and dirt on your body than what is left in the unit. Poop comes in all colours; in this case, red and white. Tim Johnson, Palm Springs."
2,Great while it lasted,"I used it for about 2 months, cleaning and charging it regularly. Then it started losing suction. By three months time, it had lost almost all suction and would only pick up dry cheerios off the wood floor, so I finally threw it out."
5,Works great,"I haven't had it very long but it has good suction, good power, and I like that you don't have to hold the button down the whole time you're using it, it's an on/off button. The extension is handy. The charger is great, it has a light to tell you it's charging and it's easy to insert the vac into the charger. The last one I had was terrible, you could never tell if you got it inserted right and it had a cord that didn't always insert correctly with no light to tell you it was charging. Anyway it's got everything right so far. I have a Dyson ball for my big vac (which I love!) and thought about getting their hand-held but over $200??? no way. I'm happy with this one."
5,The only negative is that it needs to be charged for a long time,"As an art student I'm constantly getting stuff all over my desk and the floor, so this vacuum is perfect for cleaning up. In the two months I've had it, I've never used it for spills, but it efficiently picks up most dry materials. The vacuum is easy to operate and the filter is easy to clean. The only negative is that it needs to be charged for a long time before use, but I just keep it plugged in all the time, which solves that problem."
4,Nice Product but Low Battery Life!!,"I read lots of reviews before buying this item. As I am not fond of buying used stuff and I was looking this vaccum to use for my car. So, I go for new one instead used. I love Black & Decker product and that's why i ordered this. It is working good, it sucks all the dirt particles but not minute (Small) particles. Also battery life is not that much as i was expecting. After 15 - 20 minutes i need to turn it off. Think before you buy!!! Good Deal But Not Battery...."
4,So convenient to use!,"I LOVE this hand vac and have had it for 3 months now. Turn it on and the strong suction immediately sucks up any dust, dog hair, and other bits of dirt in stair corners and other places where it would be a pain (and overkill) to use a full-size vacuum. You won't regret the purchase, especially at such a reasonable price. The only cons would be its rather loud noise and small filter which might require frequent replacement depending on use. Otherwise, thanks to the Dustbuster my house is a lot cleaner. I'd definitely recommend."
1,Little to no suction,"I bought this vacuum recently. If I could give this hand vacuum a zero, I would. It has little to no suction. I use it to pick up crumbs in the kitchen and to clean the car seat of a few dog hairs from my Shiba-Inu, no heavy duty job!, - forget it, crumbs remain on the kitchen floor and the dog hairs get stuck in the brush area, the inside where the filter is remains clean. I had this vacuum hanging on the wall and plugged in. It starts out with fair suction but immediately the power starts to fade until it completely stops. I don't know how they have the nerve to label this vacuum ""Cyclonic-Action Cordless."" I will never buy another Black & Decker product again. I had the same problem with my previous Black and Decker hand vac, but I thought they might have improved so I gave it another try to my great regret. I wish I could get my money back, but I got so mad I threw it out."
3,CYCLONIC DUSTBUSTER HAS A VERY CHEAP FILTER BUT DOES GOOD JOB OF CLEANING.,Too bad Black & Decker doesn't make a better filter for this dustbuster. Does a good job of picking up cat litter and small dust particles. Filter is unacceptable. Amazon should not advertize the filter I ordered for the new dustbuster as fitting. It does not--FALSE ADVERTISING. No response to my request to exchange for a filter that fits. UNHAPPY CUSTOMER.
4,Powerful Little Machine,"This is a terrific little vacuum. I wanted one mainly for picking up dust and dirt. It's strong enough to suction up whatever I want but doesn't cause problems with wires or paper.Because it's such a small vacuum it has a small filter so the dirt needs to be emptied regularly in order to keep the suction acceptable. I just place the vacuum in a plastic supermarket bag and open it up - all the dust and dirt goes into the plastic bag. I then take the vacuum out, put it back together and tie up the bag. Takes no more than 30 seconds.The extension is a terrific help for getting into narrow or out-of-reach areas and one you have it it's a must-have. Get one, you'll enjoy it!"
4,Good Value,We previously owned a black & decker dustbuster before this one. They work great for about 3 years if you use them a lot like we do. The battery usually starts charging less and less over time. They are not ment to last long term and you cant just buy a new battery. For the price it fits the use you get out of it. This one is cool because it has a washable filter. This is great for many reasons. You dont have to buy extra filters which can be expensive unless you find them for a great deal on ebay but also because they stop making the models after a year or two and it can be a challenge to find the replacement filters. This one is also cool with the extendable hose which makes it easy to get under small hard to reach places.
1,NO POWER,THIS PRODUCT IS THE WORST HAND VAC I HAVE EVER OWNED.JUST GOT IT ONE DAY AGO.CHARGED IT FOR 24HR. STARTED TO USE IT FIRST THE FILTER GETS CLOGGED.THEN IT LOOSES POWER IN 4MIN. FLAT. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!BLACK & DECKER SOLD OUT TO CHINA LIKE EVERY OTHER CORP.MORE JUNK FROM CHINA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Very Good Quality,"This has been a good purchase for me. It is great for both cleaning out my car and small spot jobs around the house. It has good suction, but it is not extremely powerful. I would say that it has enough power for most jobs, but not a lot more. The construction, of course, is plastic, but it is fairly solid and sturdy as far as plastic goes, plenty solid enough for its use. The recharging takes a while, but this is not a problem, as you can use it and just park it on the shoe for recharging. The dust chamber can fill up pretty quickly if you are working on a dirty surface, but it is pretty quick and simple to empty it. Overall, a quite satisfactory product."
2,Disappointed.,Was expecting a lot from this product because its black and decker. Used it for a few months and the suction is almost non-existent. The on and off switch was not made properly because it looses some suction through there.
1,Battery is almost dead after 1-year occasionally usage,Battery died after 1-year occasionally usage. Now it is only working less than 3 min after overnight charging. Very disappointed.
2,Battery dies quickly,"To be fair, this duster is good enough to pick up some hair and dust lying around. The suction however, is not enough for anything else.The battery will give you 5min of good cleaning. I should have gotten a more powerful version"
2,Wouldn't recommend it!,"No. It was not really useful at all. Maybe I got a bad one. But, since I was very busy with my work, couldn't find time to return the package. I went with the Black and Decker name, but apparently, this is not a good product from them. The charge wouldn't stay on even for a few minutes of cleanup. The power was not good enough to suck up all the dust I was trying to clean up. So, no, I wouldn't recommend this item at all. The reason for two stars: Just giving the benefit of doubt for the item - I probably got one without a good battery on it! When it was fully charged, for a few seconds(about 15 seconds), it would work ok, but then, I have to charge it for another 2 hrs to make it work that way again."
3,Handheld Vaccum from Black & Decker,"Nice little vac for the price... The downside? According to instrucitons, it takes 21 hours for it initially to charge, then I was only able to use it for about five minutes at full suction capacity. Slightly disappointing."
3,Behaves as expected,"This product behaves as I expected it to. It's a DustBuster, not a full vac, so I didn't expect the same suction I get from my vacuum; nor did I get it. It's strong enough to pick up crumbs, dead ants, and tiny paper scraps from my scrapbooking efforts. The battery lasted just long enough to vacuum out my car, and it did a fair, though not outstanding, job of that. My only complaints so far would be that the extension nozzle doesn't stay extended -- at a touch it collapses, and that the brush which does stay attached when put onto the nozzle, doesn't stay in place for storage. No complaints about this unit -- it is adequate for a quick cleanup, at a good price."
3,b&d handvac,"I have used Black & Decker Handvacs for years and when I needed to replace one that I had, and used regularly,I wasn't able to replace it with one under $49.95 at my local stores. The last one I purchased was under $30. I chose this one for the price and wieght. Another handvac called ""The Shark"" was very heavy. I have only been using it for a short time but the power seems good at picking up normal household crumbs, grass etc. The only thing that this one lacks that my older models seemed to have is a wider pick-up width. This means I have to go over an area a few times to get more area picked up. The last model I had was the B&D Wet Vac model that I don't see available anywhere any longer. It seems that all the companies are constantly changing models and sometimes they make the ""new"" model less efficient but higher in price. Other than that, I would say it is a GOOD product for the PRICE."
4,Very handy,"I purchased this vac one month ago, and it is working great. It's great for cleaning up around the wood stove, picks up large and small bits of wood. I'm very happy with it."
1,They sent me a lesser product,"I ordered model # CHV9608 which included a wall mountable charger base (one piece). They sent me model # CHV9610 which included a wall mount base and a separate charger. I just hope that returning something to ""Sams Online"" is as easy as returns to Amazon."
1,TERRIBLE,I REGRET BUYING THIS BLACK AND DECKER DUSTER BECAUSE IT HAS NO SUCTION ...IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY . AND TO MAKE IT WORSE THEY SENT ME TWO !!!
2,Needs some water protection,"This rack does its job and holds dished but after awhile the wood turns white, especially in the middle from the constant water exposure. It needs some type of polyurethane or protective coating to stop this from happening. The richness of the bamboo color fades fast due to this."
2,Eye that lacks quality,This is more of a temporary solution rather then a real solution for homeowners. I'm currently using a dry pad in lieu of this dish rack. The dish rack remains hidden away in my center island to never be seen again....
4,Perfectly Serviceable Dishrack,I've been using this dish rack daily for about 6 months now. It's held up very well. It looks nicer than a plastic rack as well as holding more dishes in less space. Glasses fit fine on the bottom rack--you just have to place them the correct way (with the bottom facing inward rather than down). My only con is that there isn't a place for silverware.
4,Folding dishrack,"This dishrack is so much better than my previous plastic one! it takes up very little space, when folded. The only thing I miss is a flatwear cup to put silverwear."
5,"simple, easy to clean, looks great","Looks great, really does a nice job of holding different plates, fits small cups on the bottom shelf. I wish it had a holder for utensils."
1,UGH.,Looked good in the photo. Not big enough for a dinner size plate. Big flaw on this. Nice finish though.
1,Can't keep bowls upright,"I don't know if there was a manufacturing error with my model, but this piece of **** can't keep large bowls upright. At all. They all just topple over one another. Large and small dinner plates will remain standing no problem, but having ""upgraded"" from a similar model [...] which had no problem keeping large bowls standing, I am extremely disappointed."
3,Well built rack with a poor stain,"I like the craftsmanship of the rack. However, after less than a month of use the bright finish of the bamboo has become dull and water stained."
3,Functional,"This dish rack is functional, but the small shelf on the bottom for glasses is not high enough for average glasses (great for coffee cups). There's no place to put silverware, and bowls tip over when put on the top drying shelf. No place for pots & pans or odd sized dishes. It folds up nice, is very compact & is very good quality. Great for single person or couple who don't use very many dishes."
2,Falling apart?,"It is a good light drying rack that is sturdy. I have owned it for 4 months now and a couple of the slats that receive the most use are starting to come loose off of the wood pieces that run the length of it. Pushing them back down fixes the problem temporarily, however it is still disipointing to have that happen so soon. On the positive side it supports a larger stack of dishes, pots, glasses, ceramic plates with ease. Dimensions are good such that a wide variety of items fit on the lower rack part."
4,Functional and stylish,"This is a great-looking dish rack and functional for my needs. Even though this folds up quite easily, I don't mind leaving it out on the counter most of the time since it's fairly attractive. However if I am having guests over I can easily stowe it. The only drawback is that you can't really put any utensils in it (they just fall through the slots). It's not huge, but I typically use this for dishes that are not dishwasher-safe, or if I just have a couple of items and don't want to run the dishwasher. Since it doesn't have a drain tray I always keep a dish towel under it to prevent puddles from accumulating underneath."
2,Poor construction of a kitchen standard,"Solid materials, but construction is lacking.There is a bar screwed in to limit the angle of the leg opening. On mine it is screwed in too high resulting in the bottom shelf being prohibitively small.But hey, it's cheap and likely from overseas- what can you expect?"
2,Very Narrow Opening for Dishes,"Lipper International 8813 Bamboo Folding DishrackThe product I received is a very nice looking product, BUT when folded open it is very narrow (9-10"", looks like a 45 degree angle)and therefore does not hold my large(10-11"") dinner plates. It is perfect for bowls or small plates. I will be trying to return it due to its narrow size. The one I received was a little different than the picture as well. It has circular dowels placed in the center of the horizontal wood for ""slots"" compared to the picture where there is wide wood pieces placed on top of the horizontal wood for ""slots"". I could see how the dowel construction might hinder the type and size of dishes used in this drier."
2,Sloppy assembly!,"This rack only holds dishes properly if the two main pieces open up to stop at 90 degrees with respect to each other. The one we received was WAY off (at more than 90 degrees). I had to make a pair of little shims (glued in) to adjust the spacing. I guess it was easier than returning and reordering again, but barely so.The identical type of rack I bought at Target (which this one replaces) was MUCH closer to correct."
3,Bamboo dish rack,"I ordered this to replace a wooden one that just plain wore out. It is pretty, but I had to immediately oil it because the water from dishes bleached it out. The item came, though, with that disclaimer. The other thing I noticed is that one of the staples holding the slat pulled out immediately. That is why I ditched the old one. Just too many pulled out. Why can't the mfg. use small screws instead of staples?"
1,moldy!,I got this just a few months ago and it is already moldy!I'm getting a different one and would not recommend this AT ALL!
5,I missed my old one,"I had one of these decades ago and always wanted another, so its exaclty what I wanted. I have a dishwasher, but most things either need a quick rinsing or just a place to dry, so when you dont have enough to fill a dishwasher, this is great. Its bigger than I expected, but not overpowering on the counter top."
3,Not a complete set.,"This item is great. However, it will drip all over your counter, being that it has no drip-tray, and also, no place to place your silverware."
2,Poor Spacing,"Unlike most other foldable wooden racks, this one has wider wooden bars leaving smaller spaces inbetween, so you can only get 14 plates in the top layer, and you better hope that your plates aren't too thick.On a positive note, the lower layer for cups is a tad higher than most others I've seen, so you got a little more space there.Quality seems alright, though it's kinda hart to evaluate after a few days."
4,Nice rack,"Been using it for a few weeks now. I like it because it looks nice, and folds up so we can put it away. My only problem is it does not have a spot to hold things like forks and knives. I ended up finding a similar product to hold them. But so far this is holding up great."
2,It gets moldy,"I am not sure why but after three months of use, the bottom got black mold growing in it. Very disappointed and they should treat the wood with something so it doesnt do this."
1,Not durable and dishes do not stand up,"I used to have a bamboo dish rack that lasted for over a decade. When it finally broke down, I bought this Lipper dish rack. It is less than a year old and I'm already looking for a replacement. Problem 1: dishes - regardless of size - do not stand up on the slots. The dishes topple over so I have to use an upright spatula inserted through the slats to apply pressure on the dishes and keep them from toppling like dominos and cascading out of the rack. The first time I used the rack the falling dishes almost cracked the glasses laying behind them. Problem 2: soon after purchase, the slats started loosening. I tried hammering in small nails to keep the slats in place but the wood split. Then I tied them individually with a nylon cord but now the nylon cord is coming undone too. So here I am shopping for a new small bamboo dish rack and definitely not a Lipper."
2,Disappointed ]:,"I ordered this product and had to remind the owner to send it after waiting a few days for a confirmation. When I got this bamboo drying rack, the slats had disassembled during shipping. Also, the slats are lose and it just seems to have been made cheaply. I only kept it cause I don't feel like dealing with shipping it back ]: I was very disappointed."
5,Great Dish Rack!,"For our small kitchen, this dish rack is perfect for assorted things that simply can't go through the dishwasher. Plus, it looks beautiful! I'm very pleased with this purchase."
2,"Nice looking, solid, but arrived missing a screw","The dishrack is nice looking and solid. The bars are thick bamboo bars and the joints are connected with screws. We had one similar rack and the joints were connected with nails, which fell apart easily, so I think the screws are much better.Well, if this product came with everything, it would be superb. But there is one screw missing, which made it in unusable condition. We ordered this on Friday with Amazon Prime and it arrived on Tuesday, so we just did not want to waste more days to return it. I found one screw of similar size in my tool box and mounted it, then it became a full piece.So, I give it 2 stars, 1 for being ""usable"", 1 for being ""solid"". But you have to get prepared to receive one missing some parts."
2,Splinters galore,"Nice enough looking, not too incredibly sturdy seeming, and just taking it out of the package put several splinters in my hand..."
1,Thinly disguised racism,"This book is a kind of technical theory of why Northern countries control all the wealth. I would recommend the book ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" if you want to really examine the subject of civilization."
1,steamer doesn't fit...,"I tried different sizes of pots but steamer doesn't fit.I sent it back.However,I am very pleased with the customer service in Amazon,Very effecient,fast and realiable.Thank You amazon."
1,I was so disappointed!,"I loved the handle on this steamer basket-no more burned fingers trying to get it out of the pot. However, it did not fit any of my pots. Much too large even for my 3 qt pot. Why don't all steamers come with this great handle."
5,Works great,"This is the first veggie steamer I've ever used, and I'm impressed. Super easy, looks exactly like the picture, stainless steel so it stays looking nice. No complaints at all."
2,"Fine, until you leave the heat on a bit too long!","This product works well enough for it's intended purpose, but if the burner is accidentally left on a little too long the feet start to melt and char leaving a wonderful fragrance and charred plastic on the pot.Get one with plain metal feet."
3,So So,"I don't know where it is made. My guess is that it may be China. I have already lost one of the covers that protects the metal legs so they do not scratch the coating inside the pot I use for steaming. This does not make it unuseable, but I just have to be crefulwhen I set in the pot. If I knew this may happen before I bought it, I would not have.As a steamer, it works well."
2,Very disappointed,"Don't waste your money like I did. I was expecting something completely different. It is tarot, astrology, numerology, divination, magic and feng-shui techniques and 3 chaptors on stock market information. I would have given it 1 star except I don't like the word ""hate"" so 2 stars is dislike.It would be great for a joke!"
5,Very good book,"This is a really good book. Not too technical, but with enough depth to be usefull for any serious christian or a seeker. The author himsellf became an Orthodox christian and presents his arguments based on history of the early Church. Highly recommend it."

2,"needs more ""revisions""","prior to reading this book, i had already taken a more difficult , engineering-oriented Digital Signal Processing class (groundwork for Geophysics) so I had a good background it in.this book attempts to dummy down DSP concepts for the laymen (or layscientists) but fails in doing so. half of the ideas are well articulated, but the other-half are written poorly (confusingly or expounded insufficiently) or are illustrated poorly.i imagined that if i had no background in dsp or engineering--the target of this book--i would have found it very frustrating.since this is a textbook, most of the readers will have no choice in book selection, anyways, so tough luck :)"
5,"Dean Guitars, Best bang for the buck !!!","Bought this guitar because of the price. Then I gave it a Gibson overhaul. Complete with Floyd Rose, Gibson 500 & 496 pick ups & Gibson 67 V pickguard & truss rod cover! Check out the pic I left on Amazon. Sweet guitar."
3,Interesting,"I am not a big fan of historical novels or histories in general.I am interested in the playwrights of the period. So I am not really the intended audience for this book.I enjoyed it well enough. However, I think I would have gotten even more from the book if I had studied the history of that time. Also, I got very little insight into Marlowe himself; there is much more about the other characters.II think you will like this book if (1) you are interested in this time period or (2) you are fascinated by the world of Elizabethan espionage."
3,Why is this unrevised version still in print in the U.S.?,"I read this book shortly after the American edition came out in 1995. In 2002, however, Nicholl published a significantly revised version, altering some of his previous speculations and conclusions, particularly on the crucial topic of who may have inspired or engineered Marlowe's murder. The 1995 version, therefore, is to that extent invalid and should be replaced with the extensive 2002 revision. For some reason, only the old version is still available in the U.S. I had to order the revised version from the UK. For that reason I cannot give this book more than three stars, and probably should have given it fewer."
4,Actually 4 1/2 stars...,"Many of the other reviews have nailed it. Nicholl has done an extraordinary job of gathering the available evidence to present a seemingly strong case for Marlowe's espionage work and murder. What he hasn't really done is write a gripping story about Christopher Marlowe. The Marlowe chapters are good, and there are several other chapters that aren't about Marlowe but are still good, though I wonder what they're doing in here. It's like he didn't have quite enough material for a book-length manuscript on Marlowe's murder, so he threw in lots of other (admittedly very interesting) stuff. For instance, there's a lot about the Babington conspiracy, which does give one a good insight into the intelligence world of the times, but oops, sorry, has nothing to do with Marlowe per se. Still, I'm glad Nicholl got it published as a book rather than a scholarly article (which is more what it reads like), since this way there's a much greater chance more people will find it and read it."
3,Somewhere Between The Covers,The front cover of Catherine Liu's first novel Oriental Girls Desire Romanceshows an Asian woman partly exposed and partly concealed in shadowwith the exaggerrated look of an Asian vampire. On the back cover we see a smilingbeautiful traditional Chinese girl reaching for a naughty piece ofchocolate candy. The actual body of the book is possibly the author depicting herself as somewherein between. She is neither the wholesome traditional Chinese flower nor the vampire.The title comes fromold ads/ scams for Asian mailorder brides of the 80's and 90'swhich is also when many of the events in the novel take place.I wanted something that was over and above the usual immigrantcoming of age story written from a female Chinese American's POV.This is certainly that book.
1,Narcissistic oblivion,"I found this book by chance on a friend's syllabus at a university in Taiwan. I was asked to read some and offer an opinion, but was unable to stomach more than a chapter. Liu's style is clumsy and self-indulgent. She plunges from one microscopic obsession to the next, and I found little of her ""Asian"" experience to differ in any significant way from that of any other pseudo-intellectual. In the end, it reeks of a liberal education gone radically wrong. She writes with an unwavering hyper-sensitivity which fails to provoke any real, genuine emotion. Endless chords of twanging plangency. But if you need a good soporific, look no further."
4,Esoteric Treasure,"I was delighted to come across such a disk. Some of my family roots include anthracite miners from PA of Slovak/Russian/Polishethnicity (no, ""Whiteash"" is not Native American). To clean up and go to a weekend dance or listen to an impromptu ""jam"" in the mining towns must have been a cathartic delight. I can clearly feel the energy of the musicians in their playing - rightly referred to in the liner notes as rambunctious. I hear a similar quality in the Stanley Brothers' early recordings - commonly referred to as ""hillbilly.""Fair warning to the uninitiated: The first 5 cuts (Michael Tokarick's band) have two violinists. I'm guessing that one is highly skilled and the other is less skilled, suffering mic-fright, surviving a hangover - whichever - and it can be hard to take. I'm also guessing that the bands, for the most part, got one shot at making a suitable recording due to cost of studio time. But these are only guesses. I, for one, enjoy and treasure this disk nonetheless."
5,Csardas Music,"I bought this to use at a wedding reception. If you're looking for some Csardas music, this is great!"
1,Not the Wusthof I expected...,"My brother has always wanted a set of Wusthofs. I purchased these thinking they'd be heavy, wonderful knives. What I got were cafeteria-looking stainless knives that were very light and not attractive. The edges didn't look sharp, taking on the appearance of a butter knife. They will never even make it into my brother's hands. We didn't give them a chance when it came to performance but I need something that looks nicer and feels heavier to the grip. I didn't think these would fill his expectations for Wusthof knives."
5,Very good poster,Very well done. Good artwork and nice details about the snakes. A nice gift for a budding herpetologist.
2,"Not just a whistle makes these chirp, so too do voices & background noises!","These types of sonic key finders, or key locators, do in fact give a series of beeps or chirps when you whistle within a certain number of feet of the mislaid keys or other item you are trying to locate. The big problem we found, which made our sonic key finder unuseable as a practical matter, is that its series of beeps or chirps were frequently set off by some just regular voices or noises, e.g., while the keys, with the sonic key finder attached, were not lost but rather were in one's purse or in one's hand. But we rate it with 2 stars, rather than 1, because it's inexpensive and you won't be out a lot of money for trying it to see if it works better for your situation."
3,Interesting,"If you have a good sence of humor, this is the key finder for you. The object is, after all, not to lose track of your keys. I promise you it will be impossible to lose your keys because your remote will respond at frequent and various times during day/night responding to tv, baby crying, dog barking, etc. Strange, however, it doesn't usually respond to whistling"
3,It does work folks.,"I've had mine for a few years now and while I can't speak for anyone else, mine does work and I can hear it pretty good when the alarm goes off. The choice is up to you though."
1,this thing sucks,the idea behind this product is great but it doesnt work properly therefore the product shouldnt be buy or sold.
4,"Lovely, but...","This is a lovely little cd player. I listen to recorded books and this has a feature that I love: it starts again from where ever it was stopped. Marvelous. I can listen to it for six or eight hours before I need to recharge the included battery. It has one sad fault: the volumn is very, very low. This is particulary annoying since it would be very easy to have a few batteries in the base to boost the volumn in the external speakers. It's almost the perfect cd player for listening to books - I'll keep looking."
5,DREAM BOOK!,"This is frankly, one of the best books I have ever read. It's got it all - great writing, a bizarre plot, oodles of thought provoking notions. The ""Huckleberry Finn"" of talking sock novels."
4,If you like this check out The 2nd Greatest Story Ever Told,This book was so good it got a bizzare reference in Gorman Bechard's book The Second Greatest Story Ever Told.If you like Tom Robbin's style check out this other book. I'll keep the details of the reference a secret so as not to spoil the surprise. I guarantee it causes an involuntary smile.
3,If only the second hundred were as good as the first,"I truly enjoyed Robbins' creative and fast paced writing style when I began the story. The problem is (As the reader from LA pointed out) the story becomes fairly boring towards the middle of the book. Another problem that I found with the novel is that Robbins seems to be trying to breakdown many ""veils"" of humanity, yet the conclusions that he comes to are not that insightful or thought provoking."
5,"After I found Tom Robbins, I gave up crack!","Somewhere I read that Tom Robbins' work has been compared to a good acid trip. When you start, everything is a little strange (and getting stranger). Inanimate objects become protangonists and reality subsides into a thick haze of enlightened confusion. Suddenly, you reach a euphoric crechendo and shake hands with Buddha as you are overcome with insight. Then of course, from that day on, nothing ever looks the same. I have read all of this lovely man's books many times and it has always been my conviction that Skinny Legs and All is the most potent. It would make a great movie, however, it may be an insurmountable challenge to cast the starring roles (although I hear that Joey Lawrence is available) of a can of beans, a conch shell, a painted stick, and a dirty sock. Everybody must read this book. There's nudity! Yay!"
5,Robbins is SO unfair and HATES women,"Tom Robbins must be a total fool to create a female character who is actually satisfied with her body, knows it intimately, and isn't ashamed to pursue pleasure with it. And, geez, I can't believe he had the audacity to go on and on about goddesses without giving male gods their fair share of commentary because, as we all know, there hasn't been nearly enough talk about THEM.Seriously now...Skinny Legs and All is a wonderful book with many flawed characters whom we love just for that reason. Ellen Cherry's mama lays down the difference between being ""naked"" and being ""nekkid"". We learn why things (a.k.a. inanimate objects) are never where we left them. And if you've ever wondered which is more important: sex or football, you may find the answer here.Most importantly, if you remember ever wishing you could BE in a book, this is the book to bring that feeling back again."
3,"Well written, but just TOO MUCH","This is a very creative and very interesting story that will make you think about many aspects of your life in an entirely different manner. When I started this book, each time Tom Robbins had something to say, it would be a clever description. ""What an interesting way to write that!!!"". By the end of the book, I just wanted him to say it, and quit writing such clever little phrases and metaphors. Everyone should read at least one Tom Robbins book in their life, but I wouldn't reccommend reading two."
2,Robbins can't write an ending to save his life,"This is the second and probably last Tom Robbins novel I will ever read. Robbins starts out well enough, but after so much of his diversions to prove how smart he is, it gets tiring. Robbins' disdain for religion oozes too much, and I really believe he wishes he was a lesbian. The novel builds and builds to a totally anticlimatic and dull ending which left me searching for the point of the whole thing."
2,P.O.S.,"Often times fiction is just a vehicle for authors to use all of their ideas and just throw them all into one book. This is the case here--it took me 4 months to finish because it was so bad. There is no plot here really. Much of the time Robbins writes about 5 talking objects which is by far the worst part of this already bad book. The entire book works up lazily to the climax where a 16 year old belly dances, her vagina visible the entire time--well that's not so bad, but Robbins has spent all the time getting to here so he can preach some of his views which are just more colorful versions of the Celestine Prophecy. Save your time-this is a bad book."
5,Inanimate objects come to life in a giant metal turkey!,"I love this book and have read it several times. Robbins' sense of the bizarre in typically mundane objects is very entertaining. This is a complex tale of love, loyalty, the philosophy of religions, sexuality and the search for real art"
4,wonderfully bizarre!,Thi book was recommended to me by a friend after I made some painted stick totems to decorate my garden with. I'm glad he did. This WA one of those unexpected gems that kept me entertained through to the lest page.
5,Reading this book is like swallowing a sunset whole.,"I picked the book up on a whim...I had read Still Life with Woodpecker three years previous and remembered it fondly so I gave Skinny Legs and All a shot. This proved to be the wisest choice I have ever made. I do not mean this only in terms of book selection - this reading (which lead me to read more books by Tom Robbins) has altered my perception for life and for that I am so very thankful. Tom Robbins turns my mind's wheels, squeezes my heart, and tangos with my soul. I've suggested this book to all my friends and about 345 strangers. I promise it will not let you down."
5,Tom Robbins is a miracle!,"I don't know how Tom Robbins does it every time. He takes disparaging concepts, merging the magical with the real, the mystical with the political, and somehow creates something which is indescribably glorious. In his pages nothing is sacred and nothing profane. Impossible to describe, he makes a universe out of chaos. I can recommend this book but how to explain what it is about? An artist marries her sweetheart and moves to NYC where politics threaten her personal and marital life. A spoon, a sock, a shell, and a stick on an exodus. A religious fanatic who would bring in the second coming asap. And a Jew and an Arab and a glorious dancer, skinny legs and all, seduce the reader into a roller coaster ride of ecstatic sensible nonsense.Tom Robbins is my favorite drug!"
2,Hard to Follow Even for Robbins' Fans,"This will be short and not-so-sweet. As a hardcore Tom Robbins fan, I was very disappointed by this novel. Granted that the author's narratives are always a bit far-fetched and twisted--and delightfully so--I found myself wanting to quit this several times, and ultimately I did. I could not relate to the inanimate characters, and Robbins attempts to make too many political and religious statements throughout the narrative. The story just doesn't seem to hang together as in his other novels, and I kept asking myself ""When is this plot going to start developing."" For me, it was too rambling and yes, downright boring."
2,I love Tom Robbins but,"I found myself skipping through half the sections in the book. I agree with other reviewers that the parts in which personified animated objects attempt to ""locomote"" to Jerusalem was extremely boring. I started skipping past these sections to read about Ellen Cherry and the other human characters. I've never skipped any parts of a novel before. It's tough. He cuts between these inanimate objects and the other characters every two pages. Then I would happen upon a religious rant that completely disinterested me over time. It's enjoyable at first, but quickly becomes tiresome. I had to put this one down. It just does not compare to his other novels like ""Jitterbug Perfume,"" which are full of deeper thinking, richer characters, and have a great plot to boot."
2,Not For Everyone,"I believe I am a spiritual person that understands about religion and the gift of life, but I just couldn't get into this book. There are two stories going on at once, the human world about a woman artist working in a restaurant and trying to make it in New York, and then there is the travels of 5 inanimate objects on a quest to Jerusalam. Lets just for a second forget that the idea of talking, and walking inanimate objects really bothers me, and focus more on their 'characters'. I couldn't get myself to relate to any of the ""inanimate object"" characters, no matter how much personification was used to portray them. It bothered me because I could relate to the other portions of this novel, but whenever the plot switched over to the the spoon, sock, can, shell, and stick, I was only tempted to read further so that I could get through these parts and on to the better ones."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"More of Robbin's trademark whackiness to be found here, and perhaps even moreso with his invention of a bigarse mobile home/caravan and its turkey shapeshifting type abilities.Thrown in with all the fantasy and sex is some commentary on religious whackos and politics, which isn't too bad."
2,Couldn't get into it,"Perhaps I'm not that smart. Perhaps I don't care for lots of descriptions and big words. I'm not sure.My buddy (who shall remain nameless, but her initials are W.L.) picked this for our book club and I couldn't get into it. I've heard great things about this author so I think I'll try another of his books, but this one wasn't for me."
3,A good book to be seen on your bookshelf,Controversial is an understatement of this book. A person that finds perversion of society's diversity humorous will enjoy this book. I found some of the character connections hard to agree with. I keep it on my shelf to balance out my library.
4,Wonderful voices and harmony,Didn't care for the selection of music as much as their Feels Like Home CD but sounds wonderful and I enjoy their harmonies.
3,compared to what ??,"I guess these guys are OK,but it depends on to whom they arebeing compared in a competition for entertainment dollars. In and of themselves, they sing fairly well, but obviously have little training as can be evidenced by some flat/staccato notes (this was clearly in evidence on their PBS special..which was dreadful)If you want the best ""bang for your buck"" get the Irish Tenors DVD which has LOTS of songs, beautifully arranged, and featuring Anthony Kearns, who may just be the BEST TENOR in the world today !!"
5,Fantastic!,"As a longtime fan of frontman Will Croxton's work (DT & the Shakes, Idle, the Masterbeats) I should not be surprised that this pop-rock combo is so full of beautiful melodies, great hooks and dynamite playing. There's something for everyone here: straight up pop (""Daylight""), thoughtful ballads (""Lazy Eye""), rockers (""Smile"") and my own personal favorite, ""Wanderlust"", complete with roller-rink keys that make the track. The mysterious ""Bound"" sounds like it fell out of a late-60's Stones album: lush, rolling and nascent. And if you get a chance to see them, everything sounds great live, as these boys know how to take the roof off a joint. GET THIS ALBUM!"
5,Best picture dictionary,"I hear that this book is no longer in print, which is a real shame, as it is one of the best picture dictionaries for adults out there. I think they should continue to produce it. ALL my adult language learners have LOVED it and I see them use it in class and talk about using it out of class. The illustrations are just, accurate, and also made for adults instead of kids so for those still in Level's 1 or beginning English levels it just can't be beat."
4,Great learning book!! KUDOS!!,"This book is great for people learning english, it helped me on learning so many objects and parts that i never got to remember on time, i used to visit a library near my house just to read this book, i have it and i keep it as a reference whenever i want to describe or know the name of an object..this book has been of a good help in my course of lerning english as a second language..highly Appreciated!!!!"
1,Not recommended,I wouldn't recommend this belt to anyone. I had it on my car for about a 10th of a mile before it exploded. It literally exploded while I was driving to work. There were pieces all over the engine. I had to cut pieces off to get all of the material off the pullies. I'd look elsewhere for a belt.
2,Worst yet,"Bought the Folgers 50 pack at Sams Club, it was the cheapest. We've bought other brands and have been refilling the cups with the reusable plastic tops for sale on EBay. Cups crack after several uses and washes. Bought the Folgers mainly to get restocke with cups, I mean how bad could it be? The Keurig coffee maker makes a cup of coffee that tastes like the best premium.The Folgers tastes like coffee we made with our old 10 cup pot. We are fast using up our used cups as neither my wife nor I are using the Folgers until we have to."
3,"Flavor is good, but they get stale and cause dribbling.","I purchased these pods to go with my Melitta one:one coffee pod machine. The flavor is good, but the packaging is poorly designed and the pods go stale after the bag is opened for more than a week. I suppose you could just take all the pods and transfer them to a sealed jar, but I'm a guy and that would take too much extra time! The other problem I had with these pods on my Melitta machine was that they caused dribbling underneath/not out of the pour spout. The pods overhang and a proper seal is not possible in the pod chamber."
5,Green and Good!,"I love this detergent, no toxins, good for the environment and it works really well.Why would you not use this?"
2,Does not cut grease,"While it's marketed as better for the environment, it's not better for your time management. It fails in particularly in removing grease from plastic containers. Compared to a normal detergent it will require at least two or three strong applications with a lot more scrubbing to remove all of the grease. For ceramics and metal it does fine but it simply cannot handle plastic well.If you plan to buy this product I would suggest you buy a single bottle locally first and decide if it's worth your time to use before commiting to buying 6 here."
3,Thinner than what is sold in the stores.,I bought a 6 pack of 7th Generation dish soap from Amazon and noticed how thin the soap was. I than compared it to the dish soap sold in the store. The store product was much thicker. What is going on here?
4,Works great,So far this product has been working much better than the palmolive I used to get at the grocery store. This product doesn't leave in film on your hands or the plates.
2,"Good stuff, but packaging bad","I really love this productor and amazon offer cheap price and free shipping. it makes my life easy. But the customer service is not good. i order whole case of this productors last weekend, but i can't get them on time. Because the poor packaging, the UPS refused to delieve to me, i've been told that it had been damaged. so, UPS mailed them back to sender.So, when you wanna order this online, you have to think about shipping issues first. Otherwise, you will feel disappointed like me......"
1,DOESN'T cut grease,"If you have used regular dish detergent, you DO NOT want to use this. It does such a terrible job getting rid of the grease. It makes the unenjoyable dish washing chore five times longer because you have to to do it over and over before the dishes get clean. It doesn't help even if you put a lot of it, it's like using really diluted down soap. I guess it would be good if you have no choice because you have allergy. Though I would probably wear gloves instead of using this. I like our earth, but I don't have time to waste my time on dishes."
5,Absolutely amazing,This liquid dish washing detergent is absolutely amazing. I feel that it works just as well if not better than the regular stuff and it makes my hands feel soft after washing dishes. It is really good for the environment and my house. I have pets and I wash their bowls with it and it gets everything clean and sparkling. I just wish I would have found this detergent sooner than I did!!I highly recommend this product.
4,"Good, good book","This is my kind of neuro book. It's integrated; it's multidimensional; its logical; and it makes neuroscience as 'mathematical' as biology can get. What does that mean? Well, it makes cramming unnecessary; to quote Poincare, there are two abilities in learning mathematics: one is sheer memory for steps in a chain of reasoning; the other, in his view by far more important, and which this book facilitates, is an appreciation of the nature of the links between propositions. If these links have been appreciated, the exact identity of the steps becomes less important because, if necessary, they can be reconstructed. This is the finest neuroscience book for its level I've come across; and if I go on to win the Nobel Prize, I know who to thank."
4,Zenith Radio development,Good book with lots of illustrations. Could have eliminated the company financial records. The landscape format of the book make it difficult to hold and read. Disappointed that more history of the Trans-Oceanic was not included. I realize there is a separate book on the T-O by the same author but there is important history that could have been repeated regarding the early Zenith Corporation. Also the T-O were a big part of Zenith sales.
4,"Good product for the price, would buy again.","I bought 2 of these with very low expectations and was actually surprised. Craftsmanship was good, no nicks or scratches in the wood frame. Wood frame is aligned properly. I will say that while they are not see through the gap between the folds is enough to see the other side. Overall I was pleased and the did the job well."
3,Not sturdy,"Nice looking screen, but not so sturdy. Has a strange smell too. All in all, it does its job. Its not as opaque as it looks, but that kind of makes it better."
5,Great price and quality,It shipped really fast and is exactly what I had expected. The price point on it is excellent. I am very happy!
2,review the shoji screen I bought thru amazon.com,"The Shoji screen divider came right on time but the packing was so poor. Both orders were damaged. Since it is going to cost a lot of money and trouble to return them. I accept them as they are, but would never recommend the product to anybody.Anna Lee"
4,Alex Toth storyboard artist & cartoonist,"Alex Toth best known for his comic book work at D.C. Comics & Space Ghost Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning TV cartoons spoke about his work on this film in my ""Jon Fury in JAPAN by Alex Toth"" Published under my ""Paul Power Publication"" banner with Toth's blessings.This was to be Alex Toth's last interview he passed away very shortly after.The comic book is a full color 68 page comic book that on sale now.The film itself is sort of like the MATRIX in a concept.I enjoyed the little bit of Jiu-Jitsu in the ""DREAM"" sequences. So glad it is on sale. It is a fun sci-fi adventure."
4,Does what it is supposed to,"Good unit, does what it's supposed to. Cap could become easily lost, and keychain tab could be sturdier, but the price is right."
2,beware MAC users!,"This thing does not work well with macs. It has caused many headaches. If freezes opened files, but you will not know this until you've done your work and you try to save it AHHHH!!! I have two macs and it has the same problem. I tried it to my buddy's brand new mac and it froze the whole thing. It's no problem when you are dragging files in and out manually, the problem is when you open files within it using applications.If for some reason you do get one (FREE) drag the files into your desktop, use them and them drag them back in manually.After I plug this thing in the USB port it takes about one to two minutes for the MAC to recognize it.The only reason I give this thing two stars is because it works better with my windows based HP.For MAC users I recommend the cruzer by SkanDisk it works perfect on macs."
3,Very Slow Write Speed,"All in all, not bad, but for the price, go with supermediastore dot com... This drive is decent, but the write speed, especially for a 4GB is way to slow."
2,OK but problems with Vista,"Works fine with XP.Their web site clalims it is Vista compatible, but it requests a driver when mounted on Vista. Their tech support was responsive, but I could not make the Microsoft fix to which they referred me work.Even if it works you do not have mobility to use it on a Vista machine which does not have the fix.In their defense, it is a Vista problem - I have another device with the same issue. Nevertheless, I sent it back."
2,Slow writes,Good capacity. Small size. But writes very slowly even after enabling Write-Caching on my Windows XP PC for the USB drive.
4,Nice product,"This does a good job for what I'm using it for: storing my digital photos. Just wanted to free up some space on my laptop. It is compatible with 1.1 for those who may be wondering, because my USB is 1.1 not 2.0. I've also not had a problem with the computer reading it, or wanting to work with it. Not too OS savvy, so I don't know if XP is the reason it reads easy or not. I would think it should work well with any OS. Reading some of the other reviews, apparently it does."
2,Returning - too slow and other reasons,"I've had much smaller and older flash drives that have worked 1000 times better and faster than this. I want to find one as good as those but larger. This isn't it. When I copy my ""My Documents"" folder to my other external hard drives and flash drives, it takes around 4-10 minutes. Copying to this unit takes an hour! And it took nearly that long to delete the folder from this unit! What's that about?Also, it is saying it is full even though when I check the size of the folder on the unit it is about 2GB and this unit is 4GB. The pie chart shows it's full but the folder of files on the unit says half that. Again, what's THAT about?This thing is going back and I'll probably avoid Kingston in my search for a decent flash drive."
3,One just stopped.,"I purchased 2 of these. One for me and one for my 16yr old son. Mine is doing fine. Holds lots of files and pics. My sons drive was full of music and school files. he was eraseing the music to swap it out. And the drive just quite working. It reads the usb, but does not find any free or used space on the drive."
2,Not Window Vista ReadyBoost Compatible!,"I wanted a flash drive for a Window Vista RAM ReadyBoost. As it says ""works with Window Vista,"" I thought it would be used to serve the purpose, but I was wrong. This is the writing I found from Kingston FAQ;' ReadyBoost is a Windows Vista feature which has the ability to utilize USB flash drive storage space to improve system performance. DT1 DataTraveler High Speed does not support Windows ReadyBoost. 'It is simply an inexpensive slow secondary back up tools. It is handy to own a flash drive for everyone. But it has shown a slower file transfer rate than my other media like Memorex 4Gb flash drive sold at $70+, and ultra 2Gb Sandisk memory card, that is almost several months old now.The reason I give 2 star is because it is low-priced."
4,jump drive,"The jump drive was received in good condition; however, I am somewhat disappointed that the cap is not attached where it cannot be lost. This is the first jump drive I have purchased that does not have a good cap. I like the size of it but that cap is going to be a problem in a busy home office."
5,Kingston Datatraveler 4GB,"I have several of these flash drives and will only ever buy Kingston. I have tried several others but they all let you down eventually.This 4GB works perfectly and very fast, too.I would not buy anything else. Kingston is about as good as it gets."
1,Junk!,"I had this stick for a few months sitting in a package. I finally needed it, I used it 3 times and it stopped working. I used many other brands of usb sticks and had them even go through the wash with no problems. This one stopped working for no good reason. I won't be buying anything from Kingston, that's for sure."
4,"""I Love it"" seems an inappropriate rating!","This 4gb flash drive works perfectly and I am quite satisfied.""I love it"" is carrying a product rating too far!"
2,Shoddy construction,"While the USB drive itself is fine (at least for the month I've been using it), the plastic construction is lousy, and broke within a week. So now I can't keep it on my keychain anymore, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of the drive."
5,Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin',"I've had my 4GB thumb drive for about a year. No problems at all. Just now, I pulled a load of clothes out of the washer and found my thumb drive at the bottom of the basket. I took it to the computer, plugged it in, and waited. There it was on my desktop with ALL data intact.Can't beat that. Wash and wear!"
1,Unusable out of the package!,"A brief update to the following: It looks like this (4.0 GB) Data Traveller, flash drive is not usable with Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5 (Leopard), but it works fine with the pre-release version of 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Maybe the drivers need some rework.I expected satisfaction from a company like Kingston - they have a good reputation to defend, from their RAM DIMM products. But none of my Macs - Intel or otherwise - running various versions of OS X 10.4 and 10.5 - have been able to mount this 4.0 GB Data Traveler flash drive. The Mac's Disk Utility has not been able to Erase it, citing ""Permission denied"" as the reason. It is looking more and more like I'll have no option but to write it off."
1,Kingston Data Traveler 4 Flash Drive,"It's difficult to review a product that wouldn't work when I plugged it into my computer. I currently successfully use three other flash drives. When I returned the Traveler 4,Flash Drive, at my own expense, and asked for another one to be sent to me, Digital Media refunded my money. Needless to say I won't be buying anything through Digital Media again."
1,Defective,"This product arrived promptly but turned out to be defective. Files were successfully transferred onto the flash drive, but after ejecting the flash drive and reopening it, some of the files were gone or unreadable. I emailed Kingston support and was told the flash drive was defective."
5,Nice little drive so far,"I've had this drive for about 3 weeks now and works pretty well. I had some problems playing a movie off it on my Wii using MPlayer, but that may have been a problem with the Wii or the software. Fast transfer times and seems well-built."
5,"Handy, Compact, Great Value",These are a great value for the storage they provide. They go right to work as soon as you need them. Thanks for a great deal.
5,good flashdrive,"Good product. No problems being recognized by the computer (Windows Vista Premium Home ed.), and lots of drive space. Very handy."
4,Happy with flashdrive.,"The Kingston DataTraveler 4 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive has met our copying needs. It is as expected and a good price, too."
1,It is not the one which I waited for,Not if it is fail of it manufacture but result that when I want to record big quantities of data the usb stops it and no longer it allow to follow recording more data.
1,POOR,i am sure the produce is great the ONLY PROBLEM IS I NEVER!!!! RECEIVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.i only wish that amazon would give me my money back!!!!!
5,Great Buy,"WOW, what a purchase. 4 gigabytes for $22. It is a nice looking unit too. Made of plastic, so be careful, but it holds a lot of information for the price. Buy them for stocking stuffers for next Christmas.The Time Keeper"
4,Good value & capacity,Good value - keep track of that capworks well no matter how secure of overly secure your system is.
2,Not very reliable,I just received this in the mail and within the first couple of uses it keeps freezing up. I'm trying to use it to transfer mp3 files. I've found that it works fine if you do it 1 file at a time. I haven't really used it for much else yet. Although it's a big 4gb drive it does not seem to handle a large amount of info at 1 time.
3,Weak Construction,Weak construction. I carried the drive on a keychain for two weeks and the connector slot broke. Luckily I didn't lose the drive with a lot of sensitive data.Make the cap and slot sturdier and I'd give it 2 more stars.
5,"Affordable, and good quality item.","I've own at least 6 flash drives, and this is the one with the best quality/price relation of them all. The only thing I complain about it, it's the cap, but you can get used to the way it works."
5,"small, fast, and good size memory.","I'm pretty happy with this flash drive. So far, it copies and transfers files pretty fast and its size is good. It fits on any of USB (which was the problem with another flash drive I had; it didn't fit on all USB)."
4,Amazon reviews are not for the same product as you are buying,"I am not here to say a single word about the product, just the way Amazon lists reviews for the product. There have been 1,2,43,8,16,32,64 and by the time *YOU* read this who knows how many GB devices sold by Kingston.The reviews Amazon lists are for all of them and this just isn't right. The 1GB unit came out how long ago??? Are the problems some reported with them still applicable to the 8GB units? The 16GB units, the 32GB units? You get the idea.It is great to have reviews from end users, but not when the seller lumps 5 year old reviews into reviews for the current product. No matter how good/bad the product was, it may well be 100% different today."
5,Love the price,"I bought the flash drive for about $40, and Amazon now sells it for only $20. Even at $40, I think it was worth every penny.Despite the label on the packaging, the drive is ReadyBoost compatible. I use it on my Vista laptop and desktop all the time."
3,not sure about it,the cap does not lock properly it might get lost very easy....however it works as expected
4,"Great product to buy, except the is little expensive.",This usb is very easy to use. I have been using the 512MB and 1GB and I like it. I am still using it until now with no problem. This 4GB is my third one. It would be better if the price is cheaper.
2,Slow File Tranfer Rate!!!,This flash drive has a slow file transfer speed. It takes me 2.5 minutes to transfer a +100MB folder containing 700 files to it. I compared the same transfer with my old PNY 1G USB flash drive. It took one minute less. This means that this Kingston Flash Drive is over 50% slower than its competitor PNY.
5,Excellent!,"Excellent USB drive. I like that you can just plug it in and it boots up super fast. Unlike the previous product I had, the SanDisc Cruzer, which installs it's user interface on your computer that you must use, it's very annoying and slow -- it also failed on me in less than a year. This Kingston is great, so much capacity and a great value, I bought two. Going to buy more!"
4,Great Product for the Price!!!,"Fast and reliable. The only thing i didn't like was the color and that the end piece that hooks on to a lanyard or keychain broke. All in all, a great product. Next time i will buy one with more GB."
2,Prepare for Keychain Portion to Break within weeks,"USB Drive works fine, but had this attached to my keychain, and after taking in/out of my pocket a few times, the plastic broke on the keychain. LAME!"
5,It works fine for me.,"This is just what I wanted -- a device that works right, installs easily, doesn't bring a lot of useless software to the party, and is basically painless. I'd buy another one if I ever needed to."
4,kingston dti 4 gb usb flash drive,"serves my purpose, sending info back and forth between my daughter. wish i had bought the 8 gb. but 4 gb is ok. I like the product."
5,Worth Every Penny,"So I bought this from Buy.com a few months back before Amazon dropped their prices. My wife then ordered hers from Amazon. We love them and use them to backup important files for redundancy (we also have an external hard drive). Normally I don't write reviews, but we were doing laundry tonight and pulled my wife's drive out of the dryer not 5 minutes ago.It still works. The lid wasn't even on it ( warning: it is easily lost) but the drive after going through both washer and full dryer treatment had all files on it, and a quick test of some word2k7 files showed no corruption. This drive is a durable and dependable drive from a proven company."
3,Slow but cheap,"The write speed for this drive is atrociously slow. On a USB2 interface it takes more than 2 minutes to copy 25MB to the drive. Read speed is fast, but when it takes that long to copy, it's hard to overlook. But, it was $20--a deal I still wouldn't pass up."
5,Great,"I have owned this product for several months now and it works great. I keep it on my key chain in my pants side pocket and have had no problems with the cap coming off or any data loss. Has worked in all computers I've tried. It has ample space for everything I need. Only possible downsides are: 1) you may not like the purple accent on the 4GB model, 2) You may loose the cap when you take it off, as it is not otherwise attached, although you can snap it onto the other end during use."
5,Thumbs up,Fantastic product.. I carry it around with me everywhere. It holds a good amount of imformation. I use it for all of my school projects. I would recommend this product to anyone.
3,Plastic breaks easily,"This is a good value drive for 4 GB, I have no complaints with the speed and it doesn't have stupid auto-install software on it, it's Just A Drive like it should be. The cap comes off in my pocket sometimes but not always.But the keyring hole at the other end broke after about a month of gentle use, just putting it in and taking out of pocket with my keys. Today I trimmed off the pointy broken plastic bits and found a tiny, thin keyring to put through the very small lanyard loop. Now I just hope that part doesn't break too. if it does I will have to find a sturdier drive with metal housing."
5,4GB good price.,"I bought and use it. Kingston makes good products anyway. I bought this with a higher price item that I was buying for someone else so shipping was not a factor, because it was free."
2,It breaks too easily...,"I really liked this item and carried it on my business key ring. Unfortunately, the flimsy plastic attachment on this item broke off. It would be great if it was better designed to withstand the normal key ring activity. So, I just left it in my office drawer and let it go. Now, I am looking for a stronger caseshell to carry it around with me. Oh well. Nobody's perfect!"
2,The Keychain Attachment Will Break.,"The little plastic bar that's supposed to keep it on your keychain will last a few weeks. You will crazy glue it back on. It will break again. You will crazy glue it back on again. It will break. If you are like me, and you need it on your keychain, this will be a problem. Product worked fine otherwise, until it broke off for the last time and got lost and destroyed my life."
3,Good deal if it works. If not throw it away and try again,"For the price, you might as well give it a shot, but there is a chance that it just won't work properly. Mine has a problem with writing to it. It'll just fail over and over again. I can reformat it and maybe then it'll work, or maybe not. I've never had a problem getting a file off of it, but putting them on is painful. But bottom line is, its unreliable for writing to. If you get one that works, then its a good deal. If you find one that has better reviews about reliability and the price is similar, I'd go that route."
5,Good Deal,"I have owned several different brands of flash drives, some good, some failed within a few weeks. Kingston ALWAYS works, lasts, and is a great value. I am a big fan of all Kingston memory products."
5,USB Flash Drive,I couldn't pass up a 4 GIG jump drive for 20 bucks so I bought several of them to add to my collection. this Kingston drive seems to perform well. I have had no problems thus far. $5/GB that is a bargin. At least for today. In a few years it will be down to $1/GB I bet.
5,Awesome deal!!!,The Kingston DTI 4 GB USB Flash Drive is the best deal in town...ALL that reliable storage space for such an incredible buy! If you've been shopping around for a flashdrive you can stop here...You're not going to get a better deal than this!! Go for it!
5,Wash it in your Washing Machine!,"Sadly, My DataTraveler has made it into the wash 4 times now... and it still works just fine after letting it dry completely. Fantastic product at a great price!"
4,Trusty little Flash Drive,"Pros: quality construction, decent transfer rates, very reliableCons: cap is not tethered and easily lost, purple color may not be for everyoneOverall: excellent product"
5,Great Product,Good flash drive. Have not had any data corruption issues and it seems fairly fast for transferring. 4GB of space certainly helps things a lot!
4,"Good for the price, but who picked these colors","sure 4 Gb of the smallest form factor of just plain old storage is great. its good, fast no bells or whistles (my style) - but who is marketing genius said Easter colors, that what the market is demanding, purples and greens. That way they will match all my computer stuff!But seriously, beyond the color (which a quick hit of model paint fix), this works great. Could use a better cap, keep loosing it, but it is pretty useless anyway."
1,Failed after 2 months,"Hey Amazon, why aren't you posting this review? Third try...Stick stopped working after 2 months of use, and has gone back to Kingston for replacement."
3,"inexpensive and portable, but the cap comes off too easy","I really like the amount of space this has on it, and I put it on my keychain, but if I drop my keys or have them in my purse sometimes the cap comes off."
3,Works fine. Good Value. Just a bit flimsy and a lot ugly,"The flash drive is good value for the money, but I really cannot stand how it looks. I already lost the cap and the plastic seems flimsy. I have it attached to my keychain and sometimes it gets under heavy items (books etc.). The drive still works. In any case, if you do not care about its looks and the fact that the cap will almost immediately get misplaced, I recommend this drive."
2,"great product, bad service","The product is fine, nice actually. The problem is right after ordering my credit card number was hijacked. Within one day I had 5 different orders for online merchandise show up on my credit card. Fortunately my credit card company contacted me immediately to ask about the charges and were able to cancel the card and reverse all the charges. It is not likely that I will do further shopping on Amazon if they aren't screening their vendors better than this."
2,W98SE users run away!,"Kingston, in all their majesty, has decided to no longer support W98 for this or any of their products; what is worse is that the lame driver they provide doesn't work properly in W98, I seem to remember that it didn't even unzip properly. I found a driver on an Italian site that allows the unit to work, but every new unit has to go through the new device found/driver search routine. Installs ok in Suse Linux, but you have to be logged in as root. Unit itself works ok."
5,"It is an item of high quality, very good.","It works very well and fast, keeps all type from archives."
1,Be fine if it worked,I'm sure they are great if it only worked ... I have tried everything .. acts like it loads but when you try to retrieve it later .. says: you must format : Tried that also.. No help there ..I guess I should have stayed with the name brands..Haven't heard a peep back from the seller..Duh on them ..
2,Very Slow,I have used Kingston DT100/4GB flash drives for some time and bought 2 of these DT 1's expecting them to preform the same. They do not! These are MUCH slower than the DT100/4GB. I have just ordered 2 more DT100's and will throw the DT 1's in the garbage when the new DT100's arrive.
5,Handy,"Good capacity, compact, cheap, from a known company with a reputation for reliability. I bought this as a backup device. It will fit easily not only into a pocket, but also into someone else's fire-resistant offsite file space. Data retention on these devices is supposed to be good, and with a batch of these, I never have to worry about where to keep an extensive backup set - they'll slip into a safe deposit box (unlike a stack of CD's) or into spaces between papers in a fire-proof cabinet. Unlike DVD-R's they have an establshed track-record on long-term data retention and will not be damaged by laying up against other objects in a drawer that may cause minor but destructive warps to a DVD."
2,Unsatisfactory,"Really, this is way too slow. but as the saying goes, you get what you paid for. It's cheap, affordable, and 10 times slower than my Memorex flashdrive. Good for patient people and computer novinces. However I would not recommend buying this product to tanyone that has any knowledge and is comfortable with computers."
1,failed after 2 months. show SKYMEDI instead of KINGSTON,"boutght 3 4G drives,they start failing after 2 month.show SKYMEDI instead of KINGSTON.looks like writes are failing somewhere in the middle"
5,Best deal out there.,"This is the best value that you can buy, meaning the largest volume for the least amount of money, from a reputable company. This is the second one that we have bought and might by another."
4,A bargain that does the job well,This is a great buy for the price Amazon has to offer on this! No issues at all!
5,buy this,"this is a great product. just plug it into a usb port & use it, that's it. it appears as an option when you select save."
5,Had One For Over A Year And Couldn't Be More Pleased!,"I have owned one of these thumb drives for over a year now and constantly carry it in my jacket pocket and use it on the average of about twice a week to transfer a variety of different files from simple word documents to photographs, software related files, etc. and have had absolutely no problems with it. Other than at times wishing it had the capacity to hold at least another 4 or 5 gigs of information.The only negative thing that I have had happen is that occasionally when transferring file it will sometimes come up with an error message concerning a certain file. When this happens I merely disconnect the thumb drive and then reinsert it and download the files again. This happens rarely, maybe once every 20 or 30 times.Shawn KovacichMartial Artist/Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series."
3,A decent Flash Drive,"This is a reasonably good drive. Works as it is supposed to and inexpensive. I use it to back up important documents off site and keep it in my back pack. The case looks and feels a bit cheap and the end cap does not fit very tightly suggesting that eventually it will fall off. I prefer a solid ""click"" when placing the cap like is the case on my Lexar flash drive. However, the Lexar is designed to hang from the cap while the Kingston hangs from the body of the drive. Anyway, I think I got my money's worth with the Kinston drive."
4,Very Nice!!,"This flash drive is really good, it holds 4 gb for a very low price, the transfer speed with usb 2.0 ports is very good and its overall a great purchase. I dont give it 5 stars cause I think the outside design of the unit could be better, a little smaller and more rounded. Ive seen better looking units but for the price this one cant be beaten ."
3,SLOW SERVICE,"The flash drive itself is fine, but it took so long to get here that I had to go out and buy them locally in order to have them on time. VERY SLOW - took more than a week!"
1,damn it= =,i bought two kingston like one and half years ago!!!and one broken half year ago (when i was turning my final report to my prefessor.....)end up like i need to retype everything...then the second one broken just NOw......= =i have a presentation tonight...i am sooooo pissed now...Will NEVER buy any kingston again!!!
2,"Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't","I've purchased many Kingston Flash Drives, along with other brands. This is my second time I've had an issue with a Kingston. I thought it was just 'one' of those things the last time, but again it just didn't allow data to be transfered. You get what you pay for."
4,Flash Drive,It would appear that the flash drives will meet our needs. The order was received in a timely manner. Thank You.
1,The part you attach to your necklace broke off,"This really sucks. I bought mine at my school. Like two days later it broke off my keys because the handle thing is made of plastic...which caused me to leave it at the school computer less than an hour later. NEVER again. I will use Yahoo Mail to transport my data because it can't get LOST. Buy one that is more heavy-duty, NOT THIS!!!"
4,college flashdrive,I am very satisfied with my flashdrive. I use it to print my papers at college because I dont yet have a printer.
5,4 GB Flash Drive,"I purchased the Kingston DTI/4GB USB Flash Drive from Amazon and it is a charm to use. I had purchased the 2GB earlier and needed more space. Kingston, keep up the great work and make larger 'Flash Drives'...."
4,resonable price and access speed,resonable price about $40not so fast to record and read data but indurable!
1,Be aware! It ceases to work easily!,"I've bought four of these with my friends, in the last 3 months.ALL of them have stopped to work. It just stops suddenly. The led on it wont light up anymore, it will no be recognized by windows anymore.Even thought Kingston gives you the 5 year warrant, it is really frustrating to have 4 (FOUR) braking in the first 3 months. Try other brands that give you UNLIMITED warrant, because they really believe in their product. Before buying this, take a look at other brands...."
3,Good buy,Its a very good buy. Kingston is probably the most reliable brand of flash drives. i have bought maybe 20 and no defects. Cons is that its very slow.
5,4GB Kingston Travel Thumb,Small and affordable thumb drive... not super fast archiving but for storing tons of data it's well worth the price. No issues with Windows XP and or Vista OS systems.
4,Wonderful little gadget,This is the most wonderful little gadget I have ever encountered. Everyone should have one. The convenience of carrying a movie on your keychain is unbelievable.
5,Flash drive,"I think it is great. Use it several times a day to back up any thing I do on the laptop, till final back up at night on PC."
2,NOT ReadyBoost compatible,"I had read a few earlier reviews that said this flash drive is compatible with ReadyBoost. The reviews are usually accurate so I assumed they were right but that was a mistake. This flash drive is NOT compatible with ReadyBoost (I just confirmed with the Kingston website).Also, the clip seems too flimsy for a keyring. In fact it seems too flimsy even for a strap (they really should have made it thicker and widened the opening)."
3,Good but Slow Read and write,"i used it on my philip dvd player so i can watch my programs and youtube videos on TV ,but its slow in copying thr comp and reading on my player - though if low in budget then its good deal***1/2 out of *****"
3,Kingston Jump Drive,"The jump drive works fine for what I need it to be: a hard drive backup. Like other reviews, the Kingston jump drive is slow. An older drive I use (a USB 1.0) copies and reads faster than this one does. Other than waiting longer for it to do its thing, it works."
4,why,"It is just what I was looking for, I wanted a lager capacity flash drive, but all the ones I looked at had programs with them that I did not want or need and ate up memory. This is just the drive no extranious programs."
5,Good Fast Cheap Storage,"Stick is fast, easy to use, does what is should without complaint. Good buy."
4,"Okay, but case is poorly made",Works great if you dont want it on a keyring - Keyring is poorly made and the 2 I bought broke within the first 2 weeks. So now I keep it in my computer bag and went and bought 2 new ones.
4,Kingston DataTraveler 4 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DTI/4GB,"Kingston DataTraveler 4 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DTI/4GBAn excellent flash drive. The only downside is that it does not come with drivers for older windows versions, and finding them online can be quite tricky. Luckily, if you have the time, you can trick your computer into thinking its newer than it is and the flash drive will work to perfection"
5,Great little item!,"These little data travlers are just the best! I went to visit relatives and took a bunch of pictures with me to show them. Since most of the photos I have are digital, this was priceless! Now, I use it to back up documents and photos in case my computer goes down. And it fits in my wallet! I'm just thrilled with this."
5,Holds a lot of information,"This was a god-send when we had to clean my hard drive. I just put everything I needed to save on this and when we wiped out the hard drive, I just easilr put my stuff back on it. Then after I have been using it and it is wonderful. I store a bunch of articles for my job on it so I can essentially work from anywhere with it."
4,A good flash drive,I got this one to replace a more expensive flash drive that I lost. It stores files as good as any other flash drive. Sometimes it needs to be replugged in to get it to show up as a available drive on my computer. I placed it on my key chain this time and it was working out fine till the handle part broke off.
5,Kingston Data Traveler 4GB,"I have several of the Kingston products. I use them to keep various image files and soem MP3 files when I'm working on my website and need to take things to the studio where we do most of the work. These are reliable, affordable and easy to use solutions. I've come to rely on them. The simple deal is, they work."
4,Muy buena opcion,"Este es un excelente producto, practico facil de manejar y lo mejor 4 gb de almacenamiento para mis fotografias es mas que suficiente, considero una buena opcion de compra este producto, felicidades Kingston"
4,solid,"It's plenty fast and plenty spacious. Can't say i've tried many other flash drives but this certainly does the job well. There's a ton to choose from out there, just go with this one. It's solid."
5,Hoosier Ancestry Research,"I was researching my ancestry online, and found this book to be a very interesting and useful companion. As I found ancestors, I used this book to learn a little bit more about what life was like where they lived during their lifetime. I now have a list of options to research that is specific to Indiana. I think it would have taken me a great deal more time to do this research online had I not had the guidance of ""Who's Your Hoosier Ancestor?"""
3,Some skips...not good...,"The CD skips indicating damage or being otherwise not quite as advertised. So far, we're able to work around it."
4,glorious music,This recording is wonderful - both vocals and orchestral music are superb. Vivaldi's Gloria is magnificent and this recording does it justice!
5,this is superb Vivaldi,"This is one of my favorite CDs. Vivaldi is one of my favorite composers and this is an excellent collection of three of his best choral works. It's great for Christmas listening, but (of course) also just fine any time of the year. The Academy of Ancient Music and the Choir of King's College (Cambridge) are superb. I find no fault with this recording. I highly recommend this CD if you are a lover of Vivaldi's music. The amazon price is the best I found anywhere, too. This is a fantastic bargain."
3,"High Points, and Low Points.","Nothing beats authentic instruments for Baroque music. The ensemble here plays wonderfully well. Nice, crisp sound to help keep it light. I also thought the soprano sang beautifully. Normally, a boys' choir mixed with men's voices, soprano solo, and light orchestra (as in Duruflé's Requiem, chamber orchestral version) sounds terrific.Here, however, the boys serve as a distraction. They are constantly slurring up to the note, as if they had been instructed to sing in that manner. I stomached it for as long as I could. I think that perhaps, for these Baroque pieces, I would prefer to hear a men's and women's chorus, as in Handel's Messiah. Luckily, these works of Vivaldi are quite popular, so I'll just have to be diligent in my search."
4,Gloria in D is NOT in D on this recording,"I am a violinist who bought this recording in preparation for playing ""Gloria in D"" with a local church group near Christmas. This recording is exquisitely beautiful... but GLORIA in D is NOT in D on this CD. I'm having to transpose down half a step on the fly to play with this recording, and am going to have to look for another recording that is true to the original key. If you're looking for a really lovely recording of this piece just to listen to and enjoy, this may be the CD for you... but if you're a musician looking for a piece you can practice with, look elsewhere. :-)"
3,Mediocre,Guy Manning's solo albums are rather different from the other projects he contributes. This is not neo-prog or symphonic per se. It is more acoustic stuff with good melodies and nice vocals. That said I'm not so sure the music has much replay value. It is not bad by any means but it doesn't pull you in either. I've tried a lot to get into this disc and even as I type this I'm not so sure I like it. It's worth a listen though.
2,Lower measure on protein and blood,"I bought this in November. Given the good reviews on this site, I didn't test the strip right away. I have been using Bayer's multistix 10 SG Reagent strips for some years.Today, I tested this product against Bayers. This product gives much lower readings on protein and blood count in urine. To be sure, I tested twice and got consistent results.It's too bad. I was trilled to find a much cheaper alternative but now I have to go back to the expensive brand product."
5,Dip Sticks are fine,The product looks idenentical to the Bayer(R) multistixs I had previously used. They seems to work as just as well.
2,Multistix Generic Urine Test Strips,Please be careful if you are using these strips to measure glucose in urine. I use a lot of different urine test strips and these give identical results to the other name brand test strips in everything but glucose. I have tested them against 2 other brands and these definitely test quite a bit lower on glucose. I have notified the manufacturers and they have offered to exchange them for me.
1,Only 2 tests on the strips!,"there are only 2 tests on the strips - glucose and protien.this, unfortunately, is not what I needed.I will stick with the more costly Bayer strips with 10 tests."
1,Won't buy again,I have to agree with a previous post. These strips have a tendency to run. I recently took my daughter to the Doctor because of a positive UTI reading which was false. In the end you get what you pay for.... I never had issues in the past with non-generic brands.
2,Not much help,"This book is more of a ""service"" business book than a ""cleaning"" business book. Gives general info about cleaning, general info about who to target and how to advertise to your target market. I read through it once and never picked it up again. I was looking for a book I could come back to over and over again for references and information...this is not the book for that. Check out ""Clean Up The Profits"" by Sam Rodman if you're looking to start office cleaning...it's decent."
5,The book is lousy. Buy it today!,"The book is lousy. True, it had well research self-help on the benefits of humor. True it is very funny. But I don't think it was really worth the whole week I spent writing it. Brother Craig"
4,Enjoyable,"The humor is enjoyable, but sometimes he is at his best when he is serious, such as the chapter on ""Mirth Ministry."""
4,Such a voice,"Rembetic music isn't something you hear often. If you have ordinary musical tastes, your chances of hearing rembetiko are on par with your chances of being struck by lightning. If you like things that are just a little strange, you could still live your whole life and never hear of it. For the uninitiated, rembetiko kind of like the blues, in that the themes are mostly the same: hard-luck women, no-good men, drinking, hashish and poverty. It sounds a bit like other Greek music, although often more mournful.Rosa Eskenazi has a beautiful voice. Often, in the slower songs, the accompaniment will fall silent to let her sing alone for an entire verse. Of course, it's a pity that these tracks were made at a time and place when the recording quality wasn't the best. However, like the best old records this one has soul, and transcends its limitations. Only four stars were awarded because there were a handful of tracks I didn't care for."
3,Works but not long lasting results,"Glad Amazon is carrying products I was paying a lot more for other places. I really stuck to the instructions of using twice a day for probably 8 weeks. Did reduce spider veins that were superficial but not big ones & no effect on deep ones. When I was happy with the look I stopped using it & shortly thereafter, my legs looked again like before I used the product."
5,BIG difference in comfort levels,"I reviewed this product once before. It truly helps to improve circulation AND it calms restless legs ALMOST ON CONTACT. Yes, it feels a little sticky when it first goes on. It's a GEL. Once it dries, you don't even know it's there. I use it at bedtime. I can't get it locally, so thanks for the source! I once thought it didn't help reduce the appearance of spider veins, but since I've had to sometimes wait for shipments to arrive and I've tried going without it for a few months, I can say that it definitely DOES help reduce the appearance of these blue and red spider veins. I have used this product for 3 or 4 years now, so this is a long-term report. I have lots of allergies. THIS WORKS for me."
2,Zzzz...,"Perhaps it was the movie. Perhaps it was the stage in my pregnancy... But ""The Dictator"" did not inspire the uproar of laughter that I experienced with ""Borat."" In fact, I'm pretty sure I fell asleep and did not make it to the end of the flick."
2,pretty childish,"I enjoyed Borat. This movie was pretty weak in comparison. lots of sexist and racist jokes throughout the whole thing, which I was kind of expecting, but really not that funny."
4,it was ok,"I would strongly recommend movie rental, if you have a good internet connection. i think the movie was kinda funny"
2,have a little laugh. don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.,"I obviously saw this movie knowing beforehand it was nowhere near bound to be an academy award winner; the idea was to watch something funny and have a little laugh. It's somewhat ok, everything exaggerated, but you do get to see real truths about the so vaguely mentioned ""democracy"" that we hear everywhere."
1,Sucks,I didn't like it at all. Was hard to get through. Stopped watching about 40 minutes in. Not his best work
2,Not his best work.,Sacha may have jumped the shark with his latest movie. The movie really felt off and many of the jokes just weren't funny.
1,irrelevant garbage,"No real point to this movie at all. It was absolutely boring, the humor was senseless and the characters weren't funny or likable."
4,Bloody funny,"It was cool this movie is very good , it expalained in depth the reality between the middle eastern policy versus America[...]"
2,*sarcastic* shocker! there was sex jokes...,"There were funny parts; however, you saw them in the previews. The movie was highly predictable and as usual had distasteful jokes."
1,Horrible,I thought the previews for this were hilarious. It was terrible. Although I like Sacha... And every other thing he has made was so AWESOME. But I'm sorry I didn't even remotely enjoy the Dictator. Not sure what happened...
2,"Not ""Hysterical"" or ""Outrageously Funny""","I guess I expected it to be funnier. Most of the humor points weren't funny. They weren't even stupid-funny. It was slow, drawn out and disappointing."
2,Meh,"Don't expect too much from this movie. Even so, it's not as funny as the trailers made it appear. Wait for it to appear on cable tv."
2,The Dictator,not as good as BORAT. Only funny in a few sequences.Don't bother renting this movie. I made a mistake and thought it would be as good as his other movies
3,"it will entertain you, if you are in the mood","I will say this one is just ok, it will probably make you want to laugh a couple of times, but if you are in the mood for watching an ok comedy you will actually laugh (a couple of times :)"
1,Dumb,want the last 1.5 hrs of my life back.think my iq dropped just by watching this movie.BAD don't waste your time
4,Very funny movie,"Very funny movie. A few scenes were teenage humor, but some were classic. I love the argument about whether the missiles are pointy or not. Probably destined to be a cult classic. Definitely the kind of movie you can watch over and over again. Would love to watch it again with friends and see their reactions."
3,Dictator,I thought it was somewhat short on the humor. Maybe I was expecting too much. I didn't recognize many of the actors/actresses.
1,don't waste your time - a new level of lousy,"I never rate movies, but I was inspired by how bad this movie is. We stopped the movie after 20 minutes. I wish I could have my money and those 20 minutes back."
1,Mo ie was too stupid,Im a big fan of stupid movies but this movie was too much cuz it wasnt that funny. I was expecting big laugh but it wasnt. I wouldnt recommend this movie unless u were high lol. Other wise dont watch
1,Crap,I was outvoted at our Thanksgiving gathering so we watched this video turd. Thankfully we watched a much better movie afterward.
1,Never could get it to stream right!,"We never got past the 1 minute mark- we instant downloaded this while at a long layover due to a weather delay. we were connected to the airport's wifi, but it just didnt matter, this thing would not load no matter how many times we re-started. I'm in my 20s, and work on computers all day, so its fair to say it was not my or my mac-book's error, but something wrong with the streaming site. Will NEVER auto-stream a movie from amazon again."
2,Crude and short on true humor,"I rented this movie because I thought the trailer was funny. Turns out, the humor was very crude and in my opinion, even over the line. I ended up turning it off half way through the film, and I honestly can't remember the last time I did that. I have never written a movie review, but found this film to be so disappointing in its lack of substance that I feel compelled to tell others."
1,the dictator review,This movie was not that funny. Ali G was his best. Streaming was fine though - almost perfect with just a few hiccups. It looked good in HD
4,Very funny!,"This is the most politicaly incorrect movie I've seen in ages, I loved it, wish he would do more Ali G movies. I paid for HD and got a very poor SD version."
4,Funny as H*%#,"I recommend this movie for anyone lookin for something funny to watch, it's not as offensive as Borat or Bruno. It's more like The Hangover with jokes you haven't seen or heard yet"
3,Disappointing,"Hoping for something as funny as ""Borat"" I found the humor strained and desperate. Boring. Don't bother with this one."
2,What you see is what you get,The commercial preview for this movie were the best parts of it. This is no Borat. I was not expecting this to be great and was not surprised.
2,Exactly what you'd expect.,"This movie was just what I expected. sort of funny, and took a little over an hour to watch. It's a bargain at half the price.enjoy."
4,funny,if you liked Borat I am sure you will like this one too. not as funny but it entertained us too.
3,"Close, but no cigar","Cohen just can't seem to compete with his classic Borat. Much more tolerable than Bruno, the Dictator fail to live up to any comical standards and the overall love story leaves a lot to be desired. Not bad, just not going to go out of my way to watch it again."
3,"Funny, not Cohen's best","This is a funny movie that relies on a few running gags and stereotypes for its humor. This is not Sasha Baron Cohen's funniest by a long shot, but for a scripted film with actual characters it is a middle of the road comedy. Many of the jokes are funny, a few are groaners."
2,Not that good,It had a couple of big laughs but that's about it. The plot is very thin and the actors seemed liked they were fresh out of acting school.
1,not really funny,"crude jokes, not that much funny. I didn't find it entertaining as i thought it would. I saw a clip on the daily show that led me to have some interest on it to begin with. I wouldn't advise for conservative households and traditionalist."
2,More R rated than I was prepared for,"This movie has some very funny parts. On the funny side I would give it a 4. However, it is very vulgar in parts to the point of being disgusting. The previews don't show any of these parts of course. I definitely do not recommend this movie for children. Beware, this movie also drastically stereo types various cultures. If that offends you, don't watch."
1,Unfit,"Beyond silly, language, valgurity. Could only stomach about the first 10 minutes of it. Watched for maybe 5 more minutes, hoping to find a plausible plot. Just not there."
2,I'd like money back,While I do like cornball Humor this is debasing and lacks creativity. One part I actually liked and I waited the whole movie to see it
3,Trilogy...continue,"another product from Sacha...if you have 1.5 hours available and you'reNOT expecting a lot...then yes.watch it.many ""ugly""jokes mix with bright ideas.not for kids for sure.generally,not art just a pub's jokes."
1,"despite Anna Farris, what a waste of time","I felt like a fool for wasting my money on a very avoidable movie. It is replete with misogyny, hurtful stereotypes, puerile sketches. All of these things can provide for a supremely sarcastic, yet entertaining farce, if done right (provided you are the kind of person who can find this stuff funny). However, in this movie is most of the above were absolutely unfunny. The entire movie ends up being a string of poorly thought out and badly executed sketches. The joke truly was on me, the viewer, for paying to watch this."
1,New versus Reconditioned,I ordered and paid for a NEW P/N 213-3457 Mass Airflow Sensor. I received a reconditioned part which I returned. I explained to Amazon that I paid for a new part and NOT a reconditioned part. I received the exchange part which was also a reconditioned part!Paid for new and received reconditioned. Catalog said - NEW!
1,"NOT remanufactured, USED.","Item arrived with rusty screws and still filthy from the car it had been on. Listing says ""remanufactured"" but as you can see in the pictures above, it is ""used"".Remanufactured should look like the picture, ie some form of remanufacturing, cleaning up, replacing worn parts etc.Buyer beware."
3,POLYMORPH makes for an enjoyable film!,"A very different movie from OZONE, in fact if I didn't know otherwise I wouldn't have guessed both films were from the same director. This statement alone says something about Bookwalter's talents. The film has a good premise and once again the effects are top-notch! The characters in POLYMORPH are well defined and fairly well acted. The characters and the conflict between the interns and the drug dealers could have made for a good movie alone and it is for this reason that the alien plot seemed a bit tacked on. It almost seems like POLYMORPH is a movie with a split personality -- a character-driven comedy/drama and a sci-fi special effects movie. The two elements don't always mix but overall POLYMORPH makes for an enjoyable film and a definite development for J.R. Bookwalter."
4,Suspenseful page-turner,"This author really has a unique style. He's not like any author I know -- totally original in his use of language. Book is beautifully written (almost like poetry at times) and sometimes cryptic, but gripping. I also read his earlier novel, Secrets, which a friend raved about after hearing him at a reading, and liked it a lot, too."
1,Don't waste your time reading this one!,Totally a waste. Everything about it was totally confusing. The plot was null and void. Can't see why the author even bothered. Wish there was a lower rating other than a one star.
1,Don't buy this if you are going to install it like the last photo,"If the only overhead space you have is as shown in the last photo, be careful before buying and installing this product. You will not be able to open your garage door because the bike or ladder will hang down too far! I have 11 foot ceilings in my garage and a bike hangs down far enough (about 4' from the ceiling) to make this type of installation collide with the open garage door. Otherwise, the product works great outside of the space where the garage door tracks are."
2,Racor Aluminum Bike and maybe a small Ladder Lift,"I was disappointed in this lift. I am guessing it works okay for most bikes, but it really isn't designed for extension ladders (which is why I bought it). It worked okay with my 8ft step ladder. I did have issues with the rope coming off the pulley. The info said on the website for up to 75 pounds, however the instructions clearly say max of 50 pounds."
5,Great Item! I am very pleased and just purchased a 3rd.,"This bike lift is great. Installation requires a little thought, but after you figure out one it is simple to install another. I purchased two and was very pleased with the product for the price. I just ordered another from Amazon. I had read previous reviews and decided to use 2-1/5"" screws from the hardware store. I also drilled pilot holes for the screws which made installation faster & easier. The installation instructions are vague but use your head, take your time and you will be pleased with the lift."
3,Might be better for a bike - but not so good for a kayak.,"I got this to hoist a 35lb kayak because it was rated for 75lb. Even with the weight evenly distributed the hoist does not lift the kayak evenly. I imagine it would work great for a bike, but maybe not so much for a ladder like suggested."
5,Mechanism Works Fine,Works just as advertised. I substituted stronger steel screws with a torx drive to mount to the joists in the ceiling.
4,All ya gotta do is find a stud!!,"The Racor Pro ceiling mount Bike Lift is excellent for those of us who do not have enough room in our double car garages for cars, motorcycles, bikes and all of the other ""guy toys"" we enjoy.......but the Racor ceiling lift really is great for storing that extra bike (or ladder) in a higher position away from all the other stuff on floor level. I am using the Racor Lift to store my recombinant bike in an area with a very high ceiling in my garage. The only real challenge I had was locating a stud in my finished ceiling......after successfully locating that.....the process according to the clear directions was completed in about 30 minutes.Thanks to Racor for making great products and thanks to Amazon for offering great deals on these types of products!"
4,Works well,"I purchased 2 of these Racor Pro bike lifts after reading negative reviews of a cheaper bike lift I was considering. I didn't want the bikes crashing down on anybody so I purchased this more expensive version. The directions and installation seemed easy enough, and the bike lifts are easy enough to operate - my younger kids use them. The rope (at this point) seems more than strong enough to withstand alot of use. The ropes are very long which I didn't need because our garage ceiling isn't that high. I would think the long ropes would help when installing the Bike Lifts in a garage with a high ceiling. Overall I would say I am quite pleased with the operation, quality, and price."
4,Just Fine,"Works great. No complaints. Easy to install. I have a very high ceiling in my garage, so I needed the very long cord. Otherwise, cut it off."
2,Not All That Great,"The RacorPro bike hoist does appear to be well manufactured but suffers from several design flaws. The hoist rope has a tendency to jump off of the hoist wheels and the ""lock"" on the hoist rope is a hit or miss proposition at best. If you plan on hoisting something and leaving it hoisted for storage it would be best to secure the hoist rope by tieing it off somewhere rather than depending on the built in ""rope lock"". My biggest complaint is that the two rope pulleys don't work in unison....if you want to lift something horizontally you should be prepared to perform constant leveling by hand. In my opinion they have really cut some corners on this item by putting profit at a premium over price."
3,"Good design, but issues raising and lowering","I had no issues with installation or parts fitting - everything went together easy as pie. I tried the hoist with both a bike as well as a yakima cargo box (which is what i plan on using it for). For both these items, the hoist does not raise or lower evenly. It requires manual intervention to get the bike and the box to raise and lower level. Additionally, the rope is very cheap and after only a handful of uses the rope is already beginning to get fuzzy. This does not bode well for the long term.The lift holds the cargo box firmly in place and I have no safety concerns. All in all, my issues with the raising and lowering are inconveniences - but for $50+ this is an issue and I will be returning this lift and getting the PBH-1R model for half the price."
2,The cheaper model is better for most uses,"I have used both this item and the cheaper Racor PBH-1R, and for most uses the PBH-1R is the better option. This item has poorly designed hooks units: the pulleys atop the hooks have gaps on the sides so the rope slips off track easily, and the hooks themselves can't rotate like on the PBH-1R. I would only recommend this item if you have to install the lift perpendicular to the ceiling studs and need to be able to adjust the span between the hooks. If you installing a lift parallel to a stud then the PBH-1R will work better.The rope has already started to fray after a few uses. I can replace it easily with a stronger rope from the hardware store, but still I wish they had included better rope from the start.The screw holes in the rope cleat were too small for the included screws. I had to drill out the holes (luckily I had the right drill bit)."
2,Now What I Expected,"Thin sounding tunes; nothing remotely to do with LORT/Fellowship. Don't think I'll listen often... but it will be a wonderful ""pass-along"" gift this holiday season."
4,Evocative of a Time and a Mythical Place,"Before the glut of New Age music inspired by Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and the orchestral bombast of Howard Shore, there was this little gem that is almost unknown today by the American record/CD-buying public. Released in the early '70s, Bo Hansson's music inspired by the LOTR is something that I've returned to again and again. I know that its organ and guitar sound is dated, but at the same time, for me, it evokes the mystery and magic--the otherworldliness--of Tolkien's books, before the Bakshi and Jackson films, and their accompanying soundtracks, had become imprinted on my brain. It won't be to everyone's taste, particularly in in these days of overproduction, but, then, that's the nature of art, isn't it?"
4,Fans of Lord of the Rings and Music that Tells a Story,"Made my day to find this on CD! Had it on vinyl but lots of playing and moving across the country multiple times had taken its toll. LOVED this music even before LOTR the movies were a gleam in Jackson's eye. Fit my idea of the original books the first time I heard it! The music is what I had hoped would be in the movie -- but this is better! When they are in the Mines of Moria you actually hear the tap, tap, tapping described in the original books! And the ethereal music for the Lothlorien are perfect. And fans of Tom Bombadil will be happy to know he is included on the CD.A great CD to have for listening with a story inside."
3,Okay Book,"The book was okay. I thought it was kinda cheesy. I got so annoyed with the main character and her inability to take care of her emotional self...she was such a pathetic wreck until the very end when she is saved. I did make it through the book, only cause I refuse to stop a book once I start more than a couple pages, but it didn't really do much for me. It was mildly entertaining...I would go with a different book if you are considering purchasing this one. My friend told me this book was funny, but I didn't really think so."
4,mmmmooooooooonnnn,"I''mnopt sure what Iwas expecting....not beingafan of F.Zappa, but the book sounded fun. I'm not usually a fan of chick-lit, 'girl-looking-for-man' type books, but this is a book any girl who's been through a traumatic (perhaps only to themselves)break-up can relate to. It's also written with a lot ofhumour andwith a likeable supporting cast which makes itmore than a tale of relationship angst. Perhpas though....if I'd known more about Moon I may have been annoyed at the autobiographical references, but what the heck.....I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a cheering read."
3,The talent of Moon Unit Zappa,"is that she does create wonderfully real, complex, lovable (in some cases) characters. What I didn't like about the book was that it didn't have a very strong storyline. It basically is about the character, America, obsessing over some spineless ex who dumped her and details her following relationships with other men in his wake. It was funny, but to me was a bit anticlimatic. Light entertainment..."
1,quite a struggle to finish.,"I so won't be reading her next book. I only read it out of curiosity,being a fz nut. It's a bit of a mess, there are a few laughs but mostly it's just whingey stuff about break ups. Most of it is annoying,pointless,a drag. I think moon unit really is a valley girl. How did this get published?"
2,"Love Me, Love My Boyfriend","This book isn't completely worthless, but finding pearls of wisdom in it is about as easy as finding jade on certain beaches on California's central coast. (it can take hours or days). Many times I felt outraged at America's spoiled self-pitying: For eg, she whines ceaselessly about the fact that as a 29 yr old ""C-list celebrity"" she only gets $2000 a month in allowance...shucks, I'd take that in a heartbeat. What's worse, she seems to have no awareness that hers is an indulgent, rather spoiled position, and actually says that while her inability to choose a career might be expected from a grocery store clerk, its certainly beneath her as the daughter of a famous person. (I detected no irony in this sentiment, either). As well, I thought the epiphany of the book was heading toward ""you can't find happiness through others, esp. boyfriends,"" yet ultimately her redemption comes through finding the perfect guy. What a disappointment."
5,Installation was incredibly easy,"This unit fit perfectly and was so easy to install,even I could do it.(Though it took me longer than the 40 minutes they quoted)The hardest part was getting the 2 new bolts threaded into the existing gunked up weld-nuts on the frame.Everything else slid right together.The spring steel fish wire that threads right onto the mounting bolts is a fantastic invention."
1,It says two lines but it is one,"On the text it says it supports two lines, in fact it supports one. It is of no use for me."
2,I can't believe this is written by Francine Rivers,"I have so enjoyed Francine Rivers books - Mark of the Lion Series especially. When I ran across this one I thought I'd find a book of the same caliber. I didn't know she penned ""romance"" style novels with little plot line. I was so disappointed. There is an abundance of this type of novel in the ""Harlequin"" romance department - that's where I'd file this book."
2,Not compatable with US electrical outlets!,"I purchased a set of these alleged boulders expecting to be able to enjoy them on a warm summer's evening in my backyard. Not so! Upon delivery, I discovered that these are wired for European 220v electricity. I had to purchase an additional power adapter--needless to say, my children were very disappointed."
3,"Great fingerprint reading, but stops there.","The device works well, small and heavy (good in this case); Just a single swipe and I am logged into Windows XP. But its functionality stops there. No other feature or integration with anything else (ex: Internet Explorer, MS Terminal Services). Unless you log in and out into you desktop too many times in the day I would say it's worthless."
3,Good Reference,"This text serves as a good reference, however, it is not necessarily well-suited for self-learning. The exercise sets need some revamping."
5,Scarf,"This was a gift for a friend whose daughter is leaving for Kenya for a Mission Trip. It was meant to keep her daughter close to her while she's away. She wears the scarf every day!! Very nice item, warm, long, great quality."
5,Rock than spans generations,"This is terrific CD with nearly all the cuts being enjoyable, which I find to be a rare trait. Some songs are superb and I don't understand why they haven't done better on the charts: Weightless; Girl Like You; and Terrified. My wife & I have played this CD way more than any other duirng the past 3-4 months."
5,Second Outing Rocks,"If you've heard the first cd from Spot and enjoyed it, Well you must get ahold of ""Weightless""It's full of Rockin Songs that define Spot.Their Best Outing Yet"
2,Average book,"After buying it and reading it, I can see both reviewer's points. The concepts of playing defense are included in this book, but it does include alot of stuff about defenses that are not played as much today (60, 76, 5-2, 5-3, etc.) in higher levels.This book is not geared to stop newer offenses, like the West Coast, spread-styles, or pro-style pass oriented attacks. It is essentially combined from articles written in the '60s-'80s, when teams were more run-oriented. As such, the examples shown are good for playing run defense against option offenses like the veer, Wing-T, and various forms of the Bone and other pro-sets (2-backs).In the lower levels, this book would be very useful, but its application to newer passing offenses is limited and not very helpful. One would need to supplement the information here with books geared to defending these offenses."
4,some what antiquated but...,"irregardless, ALL COACHES NEED THESE FUNDAMENTALS. Why? Cause whats old is new again. All these athletic players (esp at the QB) means a return of option plays in the scheme. How are you gonna stop it if you dont have fundamentals? This book is where you can get them. Worthy of a spot on your bookshelf or on your hard drive. No doubt Bill Belichick has this book or something like it on his, and browses through it whne faced with certain opponents."
2,Defenses of the 60s in a book that comes out in 2000??,"Aww come on! This is the best the AFCA could do? Lets call it what it really is THE BEST OF THE AFCA MANUALS (DEFENSE). Now granted some techniques and fundamentals are ageless, but the AFCA has members at every major college and most professional teams. This is not the best it could do."
5,MIGS TAKES YOU DEEPER!!!!!!!!!,"Just when you thought Naked was beginning to lose its steam after Nude Dimensions Vol. 3, Migs brings the traditional Naked vibe back with Nude Tempo 1! I have to admit Nude Dimensions Vol. 3 was a little lack luster compared to Naked compilations thus far, but that is not the case for Nude Tempo 1. The vibe for this CD is complete with the rich and deep soulful vibe Naked fans have come to love. Migs definitely went all out with this 4 on the floor audible treat. Just purchase the CD and you'll understand what I'm saying immediately. Trust me no regrets!"
3,So-so,"I purchased ""Colorful You"" and really enjoyed it, so thought I'd get ""Nude Tempo"" since it got rave reviews as well. Well, it wasn't what I had hoped ... it was OK at best ... pretty chill to listen to in the car, but couldn't imagine myself really getting into it. But then, a lot of ppl think ""Colorful You"" is too poppy .. then, I guess that's what I like!! I say, if you have to buy a Miguel Migs CD ... get ""Colorful You"" and borrow ""Nude Tempo""."
5,WoW....dam,"This is one of the greatest house music compilations ever. I mean, it is the epitome of deep house. This is what deep house should sound like.I'm in luv with this CD even though i bought it about 2 years ago.The first song is banging as hell, i couldn't stop dancing when I heard it, haha..... I recommend this CD to everyone out there, not just the house lovers but for everyone......... go get it now !!!!"
4,SAN FRANCISCO DEEP HOUSE!!,"Remember where it all started, SAN FRANCISCO, not NYC. Naked Music was based out of the delux city of SAN FRANCISCO. It has all the elements of what the City and its house music has to offer. Miguel Migs gives us what the San Francisco sound, sounds like. All I can say about this comp is that it is sure one of the best. Blended smoothly, carefully, and with just the right beats it will make you want to come to SAN FRANCISCO where Miguel Migs is based, dj's and calls his HOME, the CITY!"
3,"Great Xenakis; the Rest, So-So","Again we have a cd with a great Xenakis piece ('Khal Perr') surrounded by much more mundane and mediocre material. However, not only was this the only available recording of this classic Xenakis work from the early '80s, this was and is a great performance by John Wallace and company. I think there is another recording of late, but I can't see this one being bettered. It is a brass quintet with percussion, and works all of the classic Xenakis sounds of the time: this piece certainly belongs to the vintage of classic '80s works.The Eben and Berio are fine enough, but the rest of the program leaves something to the imagination. Never mind, for at the cheap used prices, you MUST get this for the Xenakis!"
3,NFL Check Book Cover,Upon opening my check book cover I couldn't get past the smell. It was overwhelming and smelled like it came from the tropics.I took a dryer sheet and wrapped it and put it in a plastic bag and let it stand for overnight. It helped a little but it stillhas that icky smell. I will live with it as I was desperate for a new checkbook cover. I don't know what they can do to fix thisproblem but I would hope they could do so for future sales.
1,Bleeds way too much to be of any use.,"While I realize this is temporary hair dye, I didn't realize that my entire body would be blood red for a week after using this product. I have been dying my hair red for several years, but have always used Manic Panic in the past. I decided to try Special Effects after a friend recommended it to me.I dyed my hair and the color was fantastic, but it bled so badly that my entire body was red for a week. Every time I showered or washed my hair, the dye got EVERYWHERE: in my shower, on my body, on my towel. The dye stuck to my hands, which meant my light switches, hair brush, and door handles all turned red, too.This dye was a huge pain and I will definitely be sticking to Manic Panic from now on."
2,Sort of interesting but no HEA,"Earth has been subjected to another ice age and the people have degenerated as they struggle to survive. Emigrants from the stars rediscover earth and decide to ""help"". Their help consists of taking valuable museum artifacts and selling them at huge profits. The ""icemen"" are considered not much above Neanderthals and are kept helpless and at subsistence levels.The iceman hero, Michael Jivar, manages to incur a blood-debt from a highly placed official. He is maneuvered into marrying the niece of the official so that the he can win a political election.My purpose in writing this review is to warn people that this book does NOT end happily. So if that's important to you, don't read it. I was quite disappointed. I thought that since Felice had managed to work several happy romances into her other books that she would have done so in this book. NOT SO!"
1,Too Darn Small,"You know, when I was looking to buy XXL condoms, I thought I would get XXL condoms. I mean, some of us need the extra-space. But dang, these condoms can only accomidate like 10 inches. I don't know about you, but to me that is NOT XXL. I need a 13 inch condom and if any of you know where I cna find one, let me know. Thanks!"
2,weak,"I had it tucked in my duty belt, and the ring broke off, and could not find it to put it back together. Its built weak."
2,Poorly Constructed,"I used this for about two months on duty before the silver clip on the top completely came apart and kept falling from the ring. You would think they would make it more secure?Also, how often do you actually need to remove someone from restraints in the dark? I'd say not very often. Normally when you take restraints off, it's at the jail where there is plenty of light. It's kind of useless to have a light on a handcuff key; however, another light is always a good thing--it can be used for things other than finding the slot to remove the handcuffs, but constructing it poorly just refutes its overall purpose for that which it was intended and that which could be utilized outside it's intended use."
4,Nice,The lights on this little guy are bright! Does what it's supposed to as well. Only drawback is it's hard to turn on one of the lights without the other one turning on as well and shining in your eyes.
5,"It's simple, a handcuff key with a light","I've used it for several years and it works fine. Yes, it does light up on both ends (the first version didn't) but that's not a really big deal. It might not fit on ""toy"" handcuffs, but for real ones (designed for real work) it'll work just fine. I'm a Peerless guy myself, but I had no trouble on a set of oversized S&Ws either."
3,great concept; broke the first night,"This is a great concept; however, it does have some cons. As many of the other reviews state, the light comes on at both end. Seems they could have a switch that slides to which end you want the light to come on. Also, it was not well made. The key chain portion broke the first night that I used the key. Having said that, the key portion worked well with my Peerless and S&W cuffs."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I absolutely love this book. A MUST READ for all pregnant women (and husbands)!! If you know someone who is having a baby, buy them this book!!"
5,"If they could accomplish this, we certainly can!","A little 'hippie' as my husband would say, however very inspiring and uplifting to be reminded what a natural process birthing is and how many ways to go about accomplishing it. Not to mention it being a lovely experience instead of a medical emergency."
4,Keep prospective,"Ina May Gaskin is wonderful and inspiring. After reading and rereading this book that provides, by the way excellent educational information about childbirth, I was firmly set to have my baby ""naturally"". I did not have anything to fall on when after 18 hours of labor and 3 of them at 9 cm I was whaling for an epidural.It is an excellent read, but remember, that this is just one viewpoint, and even if you had an epidural or a c-section, most important thing is that you are alive and so is your baby. So some other books too."
5,A Must Read for Natural Childbirth,"This book was the first book I read on natural childbirth. It altered the way I looked at giving birth and ultimately being a woman. I was not pregnant or even thinking about being pregnant at the time I read this book, but it did open my eyes. Parts of it may seem dated to some, but actually giving birth in the U.S. has regressed. What was once a natural and beautiful experience, has now become akin to having a disease and that is just a shame. A must read for anyone who is thinking about natural childbirth."
5,Great book!,This book is fantastic! I originally bought it to break through some of the negative imagery I had regarding child birth. The media had pumped me so full of pain and bad that I was terrified at the idea of having kids. I still don't have any but this book has made me more comfortable with the idea...plus I have leant it to friends and family as they fell pregnant all claiming they found the positive stories a great help! A must read for any expectant or simply curious woman ;D
5,Spiritual Midwifery review,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who's planning a natural homebirth, with or without a midwife in my opinion. Beautiful birth stories in it."
5,The Best Childbirth Book Ever,"I loved the personal stories in this. I couldn't put this book down once I picked it up and I had already had my twins three months earlier. It made me want to have more babies just to feel childbirth the way it was written. True stuff, an amazing book, revolutionary."
5,Love Ina May!!,"This was a great, great read. Ina May is one of my favorite authors now, I wish she'd written more than 2 or 3 books! This and the Guide to Childbirth cover so much, though, I guess there really isn't any need. Very useful book for anyone who's pregnant, especially those planning a home birth, and super-fun to read, as well. Covers birth stories, what the midwives do if/when problems arise, the stages/physiology of pregnancy and birth, and much more. Definitely one of the best books I've read on pregnancy/birth."
5,An old friend,"I bought my original copy of this book in the 70's. It served me through both of my pregnancies, inspired me to want to be involved with catching babies. My route was through med school. The book was loaned out many times. Its great strength is in the many good birthing stories. Our culture's view of birthing is full of horror stories that terrify mothers. A terrified woman does not have a good birthing experience. We are also inundated with technology. This book is a marvelous antidote, and has been important in making birth a normal and positive experience for the women who delivered with me. It is delightful to have the new edition, and to read through it again."
5,Must-read pregnancy book....,This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend to ANY woman. It will open your eyes and heart
5,A shift in perception--an absolute must read,"This is the first book I ever read on midwifery when I decided to have a homebirth. This book changed my life. In my mind it brought birth back to where it should be. Not only in the hands of women, but in the hands of the mother herself. It is an honor to be in a laboring woman's presence and this book is packed with beautiful birth stories of women trying to bring their precious children into the world in the gentlest most loving way possible. Wouldn't we all like to start out this way? Every woman should read this book and remember the inner strength that is already within them. This book inspires all of that and more."
1,Broke on second use,"Garbage. The plastic tube is NOT heatproof and snapped off as I was basting the turkey. This was with the pan pulled out of the oven! I called customer service and was told ""The plastic is not intended to contain any hot liquid. You should have waited until it was room temperature."" Whoever heard of basting a turkey at room temperature??I will not be purchasing from this company again."
3,Green Day for kids,"So these guys are, like, 14 years old? At right about that age, most kids get cool points for OWNING a guitar and haven't even heard of chords yet. This crew gets points for novelty alone. Although it's a bit hard to forget the age thing in listening to Face Down (the lyrical content is all teen love-type things,) the riffs are catchy and sing-songey and not at all an ear sore. They also get kudos for the Disney-type cover art (your mom'll never suspect this is punk!) and the white-glue/egg-white spikey hair. Serial Joe are the NKOTB of rock; the Green Day of the 8 to 12 age group. Harmless punk for kids."
5,I love serial joe,they are awesome. get this cd it is worth the money payed for it. mistake is awesome and the other songs are great too.p.s. i don't know how to cAPITALIZE
5,They rock!!!!!,Serial Joe are the coolest sounding guys ever!! I love Ryan`s voice... and his looks. I`ve been a fan of there`s since b4 Skidrow became popular!! That was a long time ago!! If you`re looking for a punky alternative sound definately buy this. They totally don`t sound like Hanson or the Moffats. They`re not poppy sounding at all!! These guys deserve way more than 5 stars!!!!!!!!! They totally rock!! This is one c.d. not to wait to buy!!! Get it now!!!!!!!
4,Great,"What can I say? Serial Joe has talent, talent to get an international career. The CD is really great!"
2,Harmless Punk for Kids,"So these guys are, like, 14 years old? At right about that age, most kids get cool points for OWNING a guitar and haven't even heard of chords yet. This crew gets points for novelty alone.

Serial Joe are the NKOTB of rock; the Green Day of the 8 to 12 age group. Harmless punk for kids."
2,Very Talented Group but Not A Very Good Cd,"I would not recommend this cd to anyone. There are few good songs on it like Should Have Been Mine, Mistake, and Face Down. But thats about it. This cd is very cheesy. I do think they are very talented and with their new cd that I heard was not as bad and actually sounded pretty good so don't buy face down go to hmv.com and buy their new cd titled Serial Joe.... Another thing I didn't like about this cd is that he rapped and wasn't good at it. Sorry Serial Joe fans. Take my advise and don't buy it. If you need it like I thought I did. Download it in mp3 format it's all over Napster."
5,This CD is great!,"Serial Joe is a really talented band. Their old stuff like Skidrow and Obsession is just as good as the new stuff like Mistake Deep, and the rest of the CD . The CD is awesome. I wish everyone in the US knew how good they are."
5,serial joe rocks my world,ohhh ryan is like the tottlely hottest and talented guy ever. and he is like so totally hooooootttttttt. oh if only one kiss
5,From an UK Fan's Perspective........Excellent 2nd album!,"Im from England and i think theres only about 4 people in this country who have ever heard of SJ (but i would like to be proved wrong!). Personally i think SJ should get their arses over here cos at the mo' bands like Limp Bizket, Papa Roach, Linkin Park etc are dominating the charts. Although SJ's sound is unusual i think it would be seen to be in the same category as these bands and would benefit - in other words they would finally get a top ten hit in England! This album is class - an unusual sound with no boy band cliches lyrics in them! GO SJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ!"
3,"Unique and different, and challenging!","Bought this game on a whim because it looked interesting and challenging. Overall, it is fun and you never know what the outcome will be. The only real negative thing I can say about it is that the board comes in 2 pieces where you slide and lock both together. However, when it comes time to pack the game away, you have to unassemble the board, otherwise it won't fit in the box! I am expecting the board to break at the hooking places which will then render this game useless. I don't know what the manufacturer was thinking! Otherwise, the game itself is just ""okay"" and I think you could get bored with it quickly after one round."
5,Great game,This is a great game to play because it moves quickly and keeps you entertained. We play it on fishing trips.
5,Good for light workouts,Somedays I need to workout but I am tired or too sore. This is perfect for those days. You get a great workout without beating up yourself. Good for beginners as well as advanced who need a something for light day.
2,Not for Beginners!,"I thought I researched this so well, but no... If you are just starting out with walking exercises at home this is NOT for you. She specifically says in her intro that it is for beginners - I disagree. The problem is coordination. Her routine requires it. As a beginner I'm trying to master walking in place along with side steps, kicks and, maybe, some arm movements. I felt like I was being taught a choreographed workout well above my ability and comfort level.I tried to remain undeterred. After turning the DVD off and sulking I said, ""No. Try it again!"" This time I really concentrated, but still could not keep up. I simply ran around my living room in small circles resembling one of the Three Stooges.However, I did like Tamilee's presentation; she spoke well and was not annoying. (I dislike when the trainer is too conversational with you.)Warning: if you do purchase this workout, make sure you have ample room to move around - you'll need it."
1,confusing workout,Too confusing at the start of the workout with the steps.l didnt enyoy it all going back to Leslie .
2,Visually distracting,"The room that Tamilee works out in is very visually distracting. It has several white squares surrounded by black frames, that looks like doors laying on their sides. There are also several black pillars right in the middle of this very small room, and I was afraid I was going to see one of the exercisers crash into them. I feel more thought should have been given to the fact that the viewers of this DVD may be playing it dozens of times to get fit, and that the background is so distracting you cannot concentrate on the exercise. I also thought the way Tamilee presented the exercises, even though they should have been simple moves, was quite hard to follow. I did not like this DVD."
1,"it doesn't work, don't waste your money","My 3 year old daughter saw this doll and loved it. I let her buy it with her own birthday money. When we got this toy home, it took us about 45 minutes just to get it out of the packaging. When we finally got the toy out we tried to get her to blow bubbles, with the emphasis on the word ""tried"". This toy does not work. We read the instructions, tried positioning the doll different ways, you name it we tried it. We got her to blow bubbles maybe twice in about 50 tries. She does giggle and burp but that is really it. My poor daughter got so frustrated trying to get her to work and also watching her father and i try to get her to work. She doesn't even bother with the bubbles any more after that first night of trying. She just carries the doll around and treats it like any other toy doll. It's an awful lot of money for a doll that really doesn't do anything....save you cash and find another toy that actually does what it is supposed to do."
1,Awasome doll.............and yet NOT,she really blows bubbles! but her hiccup is not good she really doesnt make any sounds.............
1,Waste of Money,"I just purchased this toy, literally, a half hour ago and will probably take it back! While the concept is great, in all actuality, it just doesn't work! Yes, she giggles and has a slight hiccup. That's not really why you would purchase this toy. It's for the bubble blowing, which is non existent. The blowing mechanism goes on for a split second and then shuts off, blowing a whole one or two bubbles...that's it! I've tried the reset button and I've put in fresh batteries but since nothing has changed, I've come to accept the fact that this it! That's all it does! Big disappointment!"
4,Decent listing of latin names and growing periods...but...,"When it comes to the uses of herbs it gives a brief overview of what one could possibly do with the herb without giving measurements or instructions for preparation. Some of the herbs listed could be lethal in large doses, which is the only reason this concerned me. It does, however, have an exhaustive list of common garden plants, their latin names, and information related to their growing and the zones they would grow best in. I turn to it frequently for growing information and as a starter on my research for further medicinal properties or preparation."
4,Wonderful Reading,"This is a wonderful book for resources on information. I love how it is laid out for you and gives you details about their uses both historical and modern. It gives you color photography. What I didn't like was how some of the herbs do not have pictures, they are more common but none the less, I didn't like how it skips out on the actual facts of how it affects your bodies systems and why. It does give you a clue as to what properties these plants have by explaining its effect in medical terms, cardiac, pulmonary, etc... All in all would still have bought this book after reviewing it at a Barnes and Noble."
3,The Ten Gifts,"For lovers of Elizabeth Goudge, this collection will set them to rereading their favourites and searching through the novels they maybe don't remember so well. It anthologises passages from her novels, themed around ""The Ten Gifts""."

2,Not This One,"I don't like to just recap what you have read about the story line because everyone else has done an outstanding job already. So I'll just cut to the chase and say that this book in no way measures up to the fun and love that was I found when reading ""Tiger by the Tale."" This one was much to silly, and while most regency romance is implausible, this one is so far out of the box that it was boring. Shoe polish as a pimple cure? Oh Please! ""A Thing of Beauty,"" is a book that you can definitely put down."
4,very good,I really enjoyed this book. The characters were likeable and the story moved quickly. I will look for more of Ms. Claybourne's books.
3,"Quick, fun read.","A fun romp through the New York bar pool scene. The author gets a little too cute with the language at times (""The glasses looked forlorn.""), which elevates the cheese factor."
2,trite,"a pleasant enough recording but i bought it because of bill bruford, the greatest progressive rock drummer. instead of synchopated rhythms and that incredible metallic snare, it has ride cymbal noodling - ting, t-ting, ting ... it's all very boring, sad to say. could have been any old jazz drummer. dunno why bruford has decided to embrace mediocrity."
3,Cliplight Inc. 582000 Revolutionary Extension Cord / E-Zee Lock Adapter Connectors,The idea is excellent. The design remains let's say in the prototype stage. The electric connector on the end of the electric tool (chainsaw and others) has a protector shield around it. The shield will not fit into the receiving area of the Cliplight connector. The shield must be filed down to a smaller outside diameter to fit.
3,A little overkill,This unit has some brittle plastic parts that didn't survive it's first big drop. I was looking for a simple outdoor yard work application for use.This unit was a bit of overkill & clumsy to use.
2,Just Not Tough Enough,"I really liked the idea, but there are some weak points in the design that are catastrophic. For example, there is a tiny plastic tab that locks the ring that clips above the cable plug; it breaks easily. Also, the small plastic ring around barrel that tightens the plug against the device will not stand any hard service. Drag it across hard ground, and it will open up. And, for heaven's sake, do not step on it!This is a great idea, but it is not up to the task of professional work or heavy field service: contractor, construction, welding (what I do), etc."
1,Sucks!,"I like NIN and I loved pretty hate machine, but this book makes reznor look like a god and I am sorry I bought it. Not even useful as a collectors item because its so full of lies about the drummer. Bad purchase, man."
5,his favorite toy,"I thought his was something small that he could put ON the motorcycle, but it's the size of a car's license plate. No matter, though, it looks great on the wall in the garage over the motorcycle parking spot. He's very happy with it."
5,What I expected!,"After several years of use, our carafe cracked. Our fault! Our coffeemaker still works very well, so we opted for a replacement carafe. It arrived in time so we didn't miss our coffee. We do have a backup coffee maker, but prefer our Proctor Silex. The quality was as good as the original."
5,Unbelievable!,"Having been familiar with Toy in her work with ToyBand here in Chicago, it was great to get the new release and see how her songwriting has grown. Every track on this disc is great, and the arrangements are so well-produced you'll think this thing was put out by a big production house. Toy makes her mark here a la Janis Ian. A must listen."
2,bland,"Dr. Rogers is one of the elder statesmen of the PCUSA. He has long been a leader among one variety of churchmen in that group -- folks who are theological moderates but fear the theologically conservative wing of the tiny evangelical contingent above all else. He has expended alot of energy over the years trying to make the orthodox look less orthodox (""Calvin did not believe in Biblical inspiration"", etc.). He has gradually embraced more radical church policies as his denomination has moved to the left, while continuing to call himself an ""evangelical.""He knows the confessional heritage of the Reformed tradition quite well, but his bias and denominational politics seem to have clouded his judgment in this book. Really, this is largely a waste."
1,Not Worth It,This book doesn't really make clear what reading the Bible and the Confessions have to do with Presbyterianism. What is attributed to Presbyterianism is so general and so neutral that it is not clear what stands a Presbyterian would or would not take. The book isn't offensive; it just doesn't contribute anything.
3,This is how it all started,"I magine listening to a group of musicians in a village with no electronic enhancements, thats how it was!A true piece of history and grass roots exposed. How this tpye of music originally started.A collectors item for those who appreciate history and origianl artists."
2,Its cheaply priced for a reason.,"Got these a few weeks ago, but i was pretty disappointed in them. I know they were cheap and i shouldnt expect to much, but they were way lower quality than what i was expecting. I thought, ""Eh... its just edge finders, they shouldnt cost to much to make, so ill just buy anything, whatever is cheapest."" But when i got them to work and opened them up for the first time, i was immediatley disappointed. They were so light, they felt like they were made out of plastic. The ends are hollowed out, which i wasnt to happy about. But i do have to say, i measured the ends and they were within a few tenths of size, and they do what they are supposed to do, but when i was using them, i just couldnt get a good ""feel"" with them. Ill probably end up giving them to some new kid at the shop."
4,"Sanus MF110-B1 Articulating Wall Mount for 26"" to 42"" Displays (Black)","Excellent mount. Easy to install, just make sure you hit the center of the studs. Invisible when up against the wall."
5,A fantastic book on a fantastic man,"I am so ecstatic that they finally have a book out there all about Gene Kelly.. The pictures are great. It's well worth your time to order it.. I am such a HUGE fan of Gene Kelly, he is the ultimate cure for the blues, him and chocolate <grin> Forever sigin' In The Rain.. :o)"
3,For people who don't like the rhyming Dr. Seuss style,"This is a good story by Dr. Seuss that is NOT written is his typical rhyming style. I personally like the rhyming style, so this is not one of my books by him."
2,"Judy Garland- The Music,The Life, The Legend.","I was very disappointed with the sound quality of this CD. It sounds as if it were recorded off a regular tape recorder. The music is full of static. The songs are a good variety of Judy Garlands' music. There are some songs from early in her career (You Made Me Love You) and some from later on (Battle Hymn Of The Repulic). Her voice is in good form, but is muffled sometimes in this CD. I don't know where they got the poor recording of The Man That Got Away. It's the worst one I ever heard. You can't get the full range of her talent here, because the sound track can be annoying. With this amatuer recording, you are better off with other quality CD's of the Great Judy Garland. Garland fans will be a little upset with this CD."
1,Perhaps the worst-written book I've read over last year,"XBRL is an XML application that standardizes sharing of financial information. In a nutshell, XML stores information in easy-to-read text files which can be shared by just about any computer. Because the American Institute of CPAs is really behind XBRL and in fact published this book, I thought this book would be a good overview and introduction. Unfortunately, it's not.Actually, this may just be the worst-written book that I've read this year. In fact, this isn't really a book. It's just a big sales pitch for XBRL--about why it's so cool, so neat, so wow... Even that wouldn't be so bad, I guess, except that this is just terrible writing. Atrocious.Bottomline? Try any other book. It can't be as bad as this title."
5,Amazingly Delicious,"I have used this marinade for a few years. In my area, McCormick is the 'spice of choice' for the grocery stores as it is a local company. For a long time there was one store that kept this stocked. However, due to the economy, that store has closed and I can't seem to find it stocked in my area. Amazon.com to the rescue!! They not only stocked the product I was looking for, but the price was excellent, too.I use this to marinade my pot roast. I just add a dry onion soup mix packet, a can of mushrooms, a little seasoning salt, and bake. Give this a try. The spices are amazing and you won't be disappointed."
5,Lawry's Meat Marinade,"Excellent product, adds great taste to all meats and tenderizes even the toughest piece of beef"
1,call me next time,"Could you please have someone ""French"" retype the info for this album? Please, look at all these typos... yuck"
5,The Five Points of Calvanism,"Any student of reformed theology needs to have Palmer's ""The Five Points of Calvanism"" as a reference book. In an easy to understand manner, he takes you through the points one by one. Each point builds on the next and if you don't fully understand one, go back and reread the last point using all the scripture references given. There are questions at the end of each chapter.Two good companion books are Louis Berkhof's ""A Summary of Christian Doctrine"" and G. I. Williamson's study of the ""Westminster Confession of Faith."""
5,Good for the common person and theologian alike,"This book uses very easy to understand illustrations. Excellent overview of the Five Points that also handles objections very well. It has been updated to include the NIV instead of the KJV.This book has been translated into Korean, Japanese, Spanish, and just recently into Arabic."
1,Befuddled,"The Holy Bible: King James Version, Black, Imitation Leather, Gift & Award (Bible Kjv)A must read for anyone who really wants to understand the dangerous doctrine of non-choice."
3,Great for price,"It's sturdy and has a good feel. I've had other tripods in the past that seemed less stable and others that seemed more stable. The leveling bubbles are useless, but I've never had a need for them before. With what I've seen on the market for the competition, this is a good deal."
4,Good value,"A lot of great features for a low price. very stable, I love the quick release catch, and lightweight. I've had trouble getting a good horizontal on the tilt head, but otherwise a deal at the price."
5,Terrific Tripod!!,"Even though my camera has optical image stabilizer, sometimes, like when taking night pictures, I need a tripod for no-blur photos. This tripod does the trick. Great asset & big help in picture-taking!!"
3,Not that good Tripod,This tripod is looking cheap. And the joints are not that good. It is s bit difficult to smoothly turn.
4,Nice for the money,"This had a lot of features I was looking for in my first tripod. Not too heavy, not too light. I saw one similar same name brand at Ritz Camera, but was shorter and $10 more. Just wish it could get a little lower to the ground for taking pictures of burrowing owls in my back yard."
1,Arrived broken,"Mine arrived with the ball head broken off. The packing was awful, but that even wasn't the mail reason - the inner Sunpak box was barely deformed. I truly understand that I shouldn't have expected much for 29 bucks, but I expected it at least not to fall apart. The overall quality was very bad as well, the whole thing wobbled too much. And this model does not come with the carrying case. Shortly after I returned it I accidentally came across a similar quality level no-name tripod in Ross, but there were three key differences. First, it costed $5.99 (that is - six bucks) - a fair price for this. Second, it was WAY more stable and sturdy and did not break down so far (couple weeks since I bought it). And third - it came with a nylon case. It is still a very cheap and low quality tripod, but unlike this one, it works, and it costs 1/5th of its price. Hope this helps to make a decision."
4,Good Tripod,"I use this tripod for still photography. This is the second Sunpak tripod I have owned. the first one was a ""660D"". This one was ok, but I droped it and broke tha pan head off; So I upgraded to the Sunpak 9002DK, which I like even more. It has has a much better working height (66.06 inch), which is a good selling point for me sence I am 6'-2"" tall. The extra height extenson means that I Don't have to bend over to frame my subject in the view finder. This tripod also has retractable spiked feet for seting up on rough terrian,such as in the mountains. Sunpak also supplies a hook on this tripod for appling extra weight between the legs for more stability.The 900DX also has very good leg locks, two levels so you can avoid crooked pictures, and a handy carring handle. The paning action on the head seems smooth to me; However, I don't use the tripod for video...Stills only."
4,Great econo tripod,This is a very basic tripod for anyone interested in mounting a camera or camcorder. The contruction is very solid and the tripod is very light to carry. One great feature is the built in handle for carrying.The package i ordered came with 2 camera mounts which was a nice addition.
2,"Stills only, not for panning","I would only recommend this for stills, not video. Good price for that only, panning is poor--doesn't seem to have ball bearing smoothness. Sony is better for the same money. If you spend a little more, Slik may be far better..."
3,"Good price, but has some cheap parts","Great for the price. However, the lever you turn to move the tripod up and down is made of cheap plastic and I fear it will snap off and break on me. But what can I expect from a $30 tripod :)The mount that attaches to the camera (and snaps into place in the tripod) could also be better designed as it sometimes take some work to get into place.Not bad for the price, but definitely not a professional grade tripod. I'd recommend this for you average user that is below consumer pro."
5,SUNPAK 9002DX:,"I'm disabled and on a very limited income, so before buying this tripod, I looked at numerous reviews, only to find so many conflicting statements, that it was hard to decide, although most of the good reviews seemed to be written by people with more credibility. I also meticulously examined a photograph of the tripod, comparing it to the attributes mentioned in the description, and finally decided that it was unquestionably a good buy. When I received the tripod today, which I purchased from Amazon.com, LLC, I was not in the least disappointed. The fit and finish was very good, all adjusting functions were smooth, and the quick release worked flawlessly. This tripod is well worth the price offered by Amazon. Michael J."
1,Sunpak 9002DX Tripod with 3-Way Quick-Release Pan Head,Item arrive broken. I never return as it came whiule on vacation and beyond merchants 10 return window. would not buy this item online ever again.
4,Nice tripod for the price,"For $30, this tripod does a great job. Spend another $100 and you can get one with more metal parts. I just use this tripod at family events and short travels. Can't really take it on outdoor hikes because of its size and weight. I shoot photos and videos with it and have had no problems with it. Overall, it's a simple, adaptable and inexpensive tripod to own."
4,Not bad for the price,"Works well, although doesn't exactly have the smoothest movement in the world. Best suited for still photography or video where the camera won't need to be moved. The carrying handle is hard to grasp, as the legs get in the way when closed -- so the handle is really only helpful when repositioning it with the legs open. The nice bonus is the extra quick release head, so if you have 2 cameras (or lose a head), you'll have a spare!"
1,it broke when I opened it,"I opened the box and set up the tripod and the plastic handle broke off in my hand. I just sent it back. Sorry to have to write such a negative review, but it is what happened."
2,"Seems good enough, but very cheap","When I saw this item on Amazon, I was pretty excited. A decent tripod for little money. But don't be fooled. This is a cheap tripod. Granted, it has some decent features and it's functional, but it's fairly flimsy and it the motions are very poor. I've tried using it with my camcorder to get some decent pan shots and it's very difficult -- the tripod has enough flex in it that any pressure I put on it moves the camera, and the motion of the head is very unpredictable. If you're just planning on setting a camera on something and occasionally moving it between scenes, it's probably fine. But if you intend to use it as a platform for basic movie-making, it's a very poor choice."
2,Not Sturdy Enough,"My good, but old Bogen tripod was stolen, so I purchased this one in a hurry for an upcoming shoot. The Sunpack has many nice features for the price, and it is VERY light weight. Thus I can pack it around (I bought the case too) all day without a problem. But, it is lightweight because of all the plastic connectors and such.So despite what the specs say, it just isn't sturdy enough to hold my Nikon D80 DSLR. I should have paid more and gotten a heavier and heavier-duty tripod. I couldn't even get the plastic Quick-Release tightened satisfactorily. However, if you've got just a small lightweight camera, this tripod has great features at a great price!"
2,Also consider Slik U9000,"I ordered this Sunpak tripod and the Slik U9000. I decided to keep the Slik tripod because it felt smoother and more solid. The size, price, and weight of the two tripods were similar. Here are some other observations:The Sunpak tripod has two bubble levels. One at the top of the tripod base and one on the tripod head. This is a nice feature. The Slik U9000 only has one bubble level on the tripod base.The Sunpak handle is slightly awkward because it is not at the center of gravity when the tripod is collapsed. The Slik tripod has no handle.The Sunpak tripod has a plastic hook that feels somewhat flimsy. The Slik unit has no hook. (but I can still tie weight around the center post if i really need it)And finally, some links for reference:Slik Heavy-Duty Tripod with 3-Way Fluid-Effect Head and Built-In Bubble LevelSlik U9000 Video / Photo Tripod with a Soft Carrying Case"
5,Good for a few laughs,This movie is unrealistic but it is absolutely hilarious it has no real relationship to reality but it is distracting and holds your attention. Get it you will not regret it.
4,Enjoyable Film,"A charming and entertaining film. Without giving away aspects of the plot, the film builds to a most ludicrous and hysterical ending which I feel many will enjoy. Tony Curtis and the very lovely Natalie Wood both play well off each other in every scene they're in.While the special features are not plentiful, you are given a theatrical trailer and brief cartoon entitled, ""Nelly's Folly.""A word of warning however, the seller ""KNOCKOUT MEDIA"" whom I purchased this film through delivered it with the disc loose, causing the disc to become scratched in transit.All-in-all, this was a pretty great film filled with charm, laughs, and and plenty of entertainment."
2,Limp Rom-Com,"To call this flick lightweight is an understatement. I have nothing against froth but it doesn't have to be this unsubstantial. This alleged comedy about gender battles is facile at best. It doesn't help that there is zero chemistry between stars Natalie Wood and Tony Curtis. That's probably because Wood comes off as a winsome teenager instead of the clinical psychologist she plays and Curtis' performance reeks of narcissism. Any romantic chemistry between the two is strictly a plot contrivance. The flick is further undermined by an extended car chase scene that belongs in a ""Cannonball Run"" film. The movie is certainly watchable but only on a forgettable sit-com level."
1,Something less than Gone With the Wind...,"This movie was made in the 1960s and it shows. Though intended as a comedy, the first half of the movie isn't especially funny. Only the auto chase scenes at the end are worth seeing and, at that, tend to be rather frivolous. However, as always Natalie Wood looked great and Tony Curtis was very at home in his part which was similar in style to several of his other roles. The plot is faintly reminiscent of a Doris Day/Rock Hudson movie of similar vintage."
5,Finally!,"I've waited years for this movie in DVD format and am thrilled to see that it will finally be released on February 3. This is a fun, lighthearted movie that is perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon. If you enjoy 60's comedies, this is a great movie to add to your collection."
2,"Great Sets, but Silly Plot","Sex and the Single Girl is a fictionalized version of the novel with the same name and follows the author, Helen Gurley Brown played by Natalie Wood, after she has published the novel and is enticed by a tabloid magazine executive, played by Tony Curtis.This is a typical 1960's movie that attempts to shock you with sex and craziness. I was mildly amused by the plot until about halfway through and then I was just bored. A long and drawn out car chase occurs near the end of the movie and it turned the movie into pure silly dribble. I enjoyed looking at a few of the sets, decor, and wardrobe as there were some inspiring pieces, but I don't think it's worth watching the movie just to see that."
2,Really dated,"This movie is one of the tame early sixties ""sex comedies"" that contained little comedy and no sex. The first part of the movie is very slow and talky. There are only a couple of laughs and they aren't really that funny.Once the car chase begins, things get a little more interesting, but not much. It starts off funny but gets silly and predicatable. The best part is when all the actors get on an American Airlines plane to Fiji- American never flew there.Even the cartoon on the DVD stinks.However, if you like to look at Natalie Wood at her sexiest, a little of Leslie Parrish- who I think never got a real chance, and Fran Jeffries, then the movie won't be a total waste of time.Just don't say you weren't warned."
4,Intriguing title,"With such a title and impressive cast, I had to check it out. It was a fun glimpse into the changing times of the 60s. While there more innuendos than I expected, it was nevertheless, a treat of another classic movie."
2,Sex and the Single Girl,"I felt that this movie was attempting to imitate the Doris Day movies, and it fell short. Natalie Wood was very stilted in her performance. She had a lot of talent, but it wasn't evident in this movie."
4,Good loud rock and roll,"This CD was my first real exposure to the music of this group THUNDER. I had been led to believe that their's was outstanding music. Well, it is good, but not that big of a deal. This CD satisfies my curiosity. This will be my only THUNDER purchase."
3,Nice product,"I really love having this cup holder to hold my morning cup 'o Joe. My only issue with it is that it is a bit flimsy as the metal band bends very easily. Good concept, It just needs to be a bit more durable."
5,Perfect for my morning latte,"I ordered this drink holder after two disastrous bike trips to the coffee shop. The first time, I didn't have the drink hole on the lid covered and I lost about 1/3 of my drink! The second time, I got a plastic stopper thing that they give out, and that kept most everything in, but because of my constant slight squeezing of my cup, coffee would come out of the tiny air hole. The idea behind this drink holder is so simple. Once I got it out of the box, I attached it to the handle bar on my bike - no tools required! I made sure it was tight and could hold a relatively heavy drink. In less than five minutes, I was ready to go! The next morning, I biked over to get my coffee and voila - no spillage on the way back!"
2,WorkBiker,"I got one for my bike one for my husband's. His was fine but mine twisted off at the first bump. The coffee mug went completely upside down, thankfully I read a previous post and used saran wrap to cover the mug so I was not covered in hot coffee. Mine had issues with assembly as it would not stay tight so I think some products may be defective."
3,Magic Green Cleaning solution,"Well this product does a good job at cleaning and seems to be a bit better then simple green, However the one thing I did not like about this purchase is that the shipping and Handling cost more than the product, What gives?? I just don't understand this but the cleaner is good."
3,A little disappointed,"I purchased the London Quireboys first album ""A Bit of What You Fancy"" back in the glory days of hair metal when it first came out. I found out about them around the same time as the Black Crowes, and in some ways they played a similar style of music. The Quireboys never achieved the same level of success as the Crowes, but I thought they deserved to. That first album was great. I even convinced several of my friends to buy it. The Quireboys faded from public view (at least in America) but I always was eager to hear more of their music. Then through the wonder of Amazon.com in 2010 I was able to find some more. After listening to ""Bitter Sweet & Twisted"" a couple of times, I'm a little disappointed. It's not bad, has some great moments, but definitely not as good as their first. If you are looking to purchase your first Quireboys music, start off with ""A Bit of What You Fancy."""
5,Initial D Battle Stage Soundtrack,"This is the brand new Initial D Battle Stage Soundtrack. With 19 tracks, this is the best of all the Initial D CD's. If you love Super Euro Beat, or the series this is a must own."
4,First pair of Tsubo's,"This is my first pair of Tsubo shoes and I'd give them a 4 star rating. The shoe looks great, just like the pictures. As others have mentioned, the fit is on the bigger size. I normally wear a 10.5 athletic shoe (Nikes), but I ordered a size 10 and they are still slightly on the bigger size. However I think if I went down one more size the shoe would be too snug. The loose fit should be alright for me since I only plan on walking around in these shoes.My only concern is the sole/tread of the shoe is a separate piece of rubber that is glued onto the bottom of the shoe. The piece that comes up around the sides of the shoe is separate. I'm not sure how durable the bottom will be and I hope the glue doesn't come undone."
5,Comfort for Cheap,"These shoes are probably the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Compliments about them are not short in supply. I'm considering a second pair. I also got them at an awesome price. Very, very good shoes."
4,great shoe,"What a bargain, I bought this shoe on amazon for $29.99. Very unusual shoe I get a lot of compliments on it. I like the lace-to-toe design and is easy to get in and out because it's round shoelaces."
5,Interesting Shirley Bassey Remixes !,The Remix Album is a good CD.I enjoyed listeng to the remixes of familiar songs made new!Fans will really enjoy this.I do because it keeps Shirley Bassey as relevant as anybody in popular music today.
3,"Novelty value,but dosent work.","She has the ability to lead any music, be it classical,pop,whatever,but it has to be admitted that she was born to sing with an orchestra the bigger the better."
4,informative dvd,"this dvd gives a nice overview about this country and the most interesting places. it is not like common ""modern"" documentaries (this hectic style....), it is of more informative character. there are some really nice pictures and an informative narration, so you can have an idea of this country, before travelling there.a nice product with many touristic information.On Tour Touring Inca Land"
4,A Good Sampling,"As a long time hardcore Duranie I am pleased to finally find a cd that has ""Like An Angel"" and ""Make Me Smile"" on it. There have been a couple of pretty decent bootlegs with these songs, but the quality was still a little lacking. These two great and hard to find songs finally are getting their due. This cd has a very good overall sampling of the band's first two albums and some of the b-sides. ""Friends of Mine"" is one of their best songs, I think, and I'm glad to see it here. It was never a single, despite its forceful drive and I'm happy to think it will be heard by uninitiated. ""White Lines"" is a little out of place here but perhaps, as the single didn't do terribly well, the label is trying to get it more play. The cover of Bowie's ""Fame"" is strong, with wonderful percussion. This is a fine introduction to the group and a very welcome addition to the collections of Duranies everywhere who want quality recordings of a couple of rare b-sides."
3,Nice collection for Duran Duran fans.,"This collection mostly consist of songs from the first two albums. It is nice to see that ""Like an Angel"", an underrated B-side of ""My Own Way"", is finally available on cd. I would have like to have seen two other great B-sides songs, ""Faster Than Light"" and ""Late Bar"", added to this cd instead of ""Last Chance"" and ""Is There Anyone"". It is also great to see ""Make Me Smile"" since the only other cd it is available on is on some crappy movie soundtrack. ""White Lines"" might seem out of place on this cd, but since it was the only good song on the album ""Thank You"", it makes great sense to put it on. That way if you like the song but do not want the ""Thank You"" album, then you can buy this cd instead. If you are a diehard Duranie, then you should buy this cd without care. If you already own ""Decade"" or ""Greatest"", then you might not care for this cd."
2,A wierd compilation with 3 B-sides.,"""Like an Angel"" was a B-side to ""My Own Way"" and is amazing! ""Make me Smile"" is a cover and was the B-Side to ""Is there something I should Know"" in the UK, I believe. ""Fame"" is a David Bowie cover from the 12"" to ""Girls On Film"" in 1981.All the other songs are available on their studio albums, making this a wierd compilation. Why not just do a B-Sides only compilation instead? For the cool picture on the cover, it would have been a better product."
4,The story of a classic novel,A great book by william peter blatty explains in great detail the process from the authors first touch with a case of demonic possession to his fantastic novel the exorcist.Very well written plus some nice scene drawings . Just 58. pages thick but a must for every serious fan of the novel and the movie.
1,Warning !,I'm french so my english is maybe not very well. Sorry ! I wanted to say that BoA is not the same as Ba. Amazon sells both cds of boa but it's not the same artist !!!
1,It's Not My style,"Just Don't buy it!!It's so terrible, Her voice is affected.I couldn't understand that why asian people call her ""Korean Britney Spears""Her music is just infantile.And She can't compose her self well...By the way I wanna criticize about her music.I think this music is composed for making money.Just Don't buy it!!"
3,Seeing Double!,"To help others avoid confusion, this is BoA, bot Boa (the band that sung Duvet from Serial Experiments Lain)BoA is, as you can see, a young woman who sings funky jpop music (kind of like Christina Aguilera, that kind of music.. not rock like Boa) Ive heard only 2 songs from her, but she has a very sweet voice backed by an electrical orchestra of synth and beats."
3,Okay,"I only like some boa songs. To that french reviewer, only a stupid person would have realised, through looking at the album cover, the difference between the french boa and japanese boa."
5,The first time,"This is the first time I have ever sat down an read a book from beginning to end and enjoyed the reading an actually got something out of it. I plan on reading more of Maxwell's books an others only wishing I had started reading earlier in life. Thanks to my boss (Denny Patterson) for taking the time to show me the qualities that I have thru this book, my first book."
4,Heiko Laux - Ornaments,"Bright and sparkly techno from Heiko Laux, ORNAMENTS stays true to its name. Rhythmic without being repetitive and melodic without being cheesy, this is techno in a pure form. ""Morning Between Lines"" shines forth, while ""Making It Detroit"" blips along at a brisk clip. The title track is much ornamented indeed with a synthesized saxophone and some deep, roiling tones. The lower tones also drive ""Tangoamt,"" which keeps its growl steady throughout. ""Walkout (1st Cut)"" is more dancefloor-ready with its 4/4 beat, but maintains the crisp edge, while ""Kick and Kiss"" hums with ineffable beauty (as does the hidden track which follows it). Excellent techno."
5,great mud guards at a good price,Very easy install. great price. Very good protection for your truck. I have bought these for every truck I have owned.
2,Vague at best,"It's a 30 minute DVD of him saying the same things over and over again. The book is better. Save your money and pass on this DVD. There are no ""nuggets"" of information to be found here, at least not for the test I was taking."
2,Like his father? No way!,"I guess you cant live up to your father's name or even give his son some lessons. I was greatly anticipatingsome nice things from this CD,but was greatly disappointed. No texture, no feelings,even on one song there was aballad and it was pitiful! The singer was terrible and was cracking. Man I could have slapped this together myself.Each part of the songs were ""slapped"" together. Every time Mr. Wakeman came in it sound like it was ""punched""by by a program. Again no emotion,just this stupid hard guitar power chords! Man, Oliver go back to your Dadand take more lessons. Just God awful! No musicianship at all!"
3,WONDERFUL KEYBOARDS,"JUST PURCHASED AND LISTENED TO THE ALBUM SEVERAL TIMES. OLIVER IS JUST A FANTASTIC TALENT,WHY WOULD ""YES"" HAVE ASKED HIM TO FILL IN ON TOUR. OTHER THEN SOME GREAT KEYBOARD WORK, THIS ALBUM HAS NOTHING ELSE TO GET EXCITED ABOUT. THE REST OF THE GROUP CANNOT HOLD UP TO THE KEYBOARD WISIDRY OF OLIVER WAKEMAN. HAD IT BEEN AN ALL KEYBOARD EFFORT IT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT, SUPERIOR ALBUM."
4,received item but no lightsaber !!!,I received this item today but minus the lightsaber which now makes this bust simply look silly.Would anyone know how i could go about ordering the lightsaber alone for this item ? Pls help......
3,Loise Phillip Style Armoire,"Product was acceptable, but a little overpriced in terms of overall quality. also, it had a small dent i,n the top rear. Overall, quality was acceptable."
2,"Very poor quality ""Jewelry Armoire""","Made in China of very poor quality material, poor job of gluing, and lots of damage on the long trip to the east coast. One entire row of hooks had fallen off, and the hing on the right door is missing several screws. If I had not thrown the box out, I would return the entire unit. Almost completely made of low quality fiberboard. Unit is worth about $125."
1,POOR QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP DO NOT BUY!!!,"When opening packaging product was broken in several places many pieces missing, horrible quality work cheap workmanship worst product Ive ever purchased through Amazon."
2,Coaster Louis Philippe Jewelry Armoire,"The base promptly fell off making it unstable and pretty useless. It was put together with staples, no glue. The presto-wood did not hold up during shipping to NYC. I was really disappointed since I gave it as a gift and it was not cheap."
4,A good read,"Lee Iacocca is obviously successful and also a touch more arrogant in this second book of his. He is full of advice on how to live and writes about political and economic issues of the world with firm convictions to back his theories.However the best thing about his book is that he is consistent in his outlook and is rock-solid in endorsing the basic values which are as timeless as they are true.One sore point that sticks out is his constant complaining against the Japanese who, in his opinion, flooded the US markets with cheaply produced products (that's way back in time in the 1980s)."
4,A lot of no-nonsense talk and a whole lot more about values,"What impressed me most about Iacocca is his incredible frankness. He doesn't beat about the bush. Also, the book clearly depicts his clinging on to crucial values which allowed him to be successful in both fields: at work AND at home. How many businessmen working or even overworking manage to achieve what he has accomplished in the commercial world and yet keep a designated amount of time for his wife and kids consistently? Goes a long way to show how important it is set your priorities right.As for the style of the book itself, it is fluent and comfortable to read.True that the book is written in 1987 and the background is two decades old but it still provides interesting insight into both corporate and political America since he's one of those who has 'been there, done that!'. Try it out, it's much fun."
4,Look good,"I just got a few of these caps in different sizes. They look good; all about 1/8 inch thick. I thought they might be made in the USA, but they are NOT, unfortunately. The good news is that they are made in Taiwan...alot better than China."
3,Outdated NASB,"I almost bought this, but since the New American Standard is my favorite translation for Bible study, I checked and found that this Bible uses the 1977 version of the NASB and not the updated 1995 version. It's too bad. If this were updated, I would grab this in a minute. (Please note my rating is based on this alone, since I do not own this Bible.)"
5,"Great Product..Great Value, and a lifesaver!","I have had my PalmIIIe for a month, and this case has saved its life twice. The first time i left it in my tent all day while camping, and it got really wet. The case, however, has a water-resistant inside, and spared the life of my palm. The second time it fell off my kitchen counter, a fall that cracked my freinds screen. The padded case once again saved the day. It also has a nifty spot on the inside for money or whatever, and I use it as my wallet. The price is very reasonable, too (Look at the prices of some other cases) And it is by far the best looking.P.S.--My freind with the cracked screen bought one soon after!"
4,Good old live Ol' Savoy Brown,"A fine Savoy Brown release (which sounds remarkably similar to the 1981 Accord double LP 'Greatest Hits Live in Concert'), with some fantastic frenetic lead work by Kim Simmonds. Unfortunately, it's minus the high octane Willie Dixon tune 'Wang Dang Doodle' found on the Accord set. The two disc show is presented here on one 66 minute CD however, which is a big plus. A good all-'round Savoy Brown rocker... Kim's algebraically-correct fingerwork sounds a great deal like it does with his current rendition of the band, which is why I was particularly drawn to it. Not to mention, raving grinding in-your-face lead vocal flurries by Ralph Morman. Unfortunately, except for a partial in-song introduction of the band, no credits, timings or show dates are given.A good disc by a great British Guitarist who still has quite a few tricks up his sleeve. Get it if you haven't already!"
3,Not Wilson's best,"When I first read this book, I was gripped by 19th century composers like Berlioz, Alkan, Liszt, and I laughed out loud at Wilson's audacious pathological explanation of 19th-c. romanticism on page 58 ff. of my Arkham House edition. It's as others say--this is a novel of ideas. If you can imagine Freud with the Id fleshed out as a character (the mind parasites), then you will be intrigued by this novel.But Colin Wilson unfortunately adopted not just some of the mythos but also some of the writing style of H.P. Lovecraft. The book is hard going, and the narrator, a cerebral Oxford-don type that must have been already dated in 1967, is a bore.Wilson credits Lovecraft, Derleth, and the movie _Forbidden Planet_ in his intro but fails to give any mention of the work he most blatently rips off: Jack Vance's 1951 novel _Nopalgarth_ presents an even more layered version of the Nopal (=mind parasites) and is more fun to read."
2,a disappointment,"I honestly have to say that this novel was not very satisfactory. The basic premise was quite interesting, but the overall execution seemed fairly amatureish. Most of the sci-fi touches in particular were pretty laughable. Wilson's ""The Philosopher's Stone"" was much better."
2,Mind Numbing Parasite,Perhaps some people still enjoy this Lovecraftian style of writing - but it utterly and completely bores the modern reader. Whole sections of needless exposition rendered this book unreadable despite the interesting premise. Poorly executed and written.
3,Robert Heinlein Without the Sex,"Wilson almost never writes anything that doesn't revolve around his ""Faculty X"" theories, and this is no exception. He is a philosopher far more than he is a storyteller, though his novels are generally well worth the read anyway. At his worst, Wilson comes off sounding like a pitch-man for EST - his heroes miraculously become supermen of Herculean mental abilities seemingly by nothing but an act of will, and resort to trickery and ruthlessness to control the masses, lessening their impact as sympathetic characters - but at his best, Wilson sounds a genuine note of hope for human self-improvement.This was Wilson's first sci-fi effort, and was written more than a third of a century ago, so it has to be cut a certain amount of slack. The basic plot is simple Lovecraft: evil aliens are keeping the human race down, and it's up to the Supermen to save Earth. You've probably read better, but The Mind Parasites is still worth rummaging around the used books bin to find."
4,Couldn't put it down,"I read this book as a teenager. The phrase ""couldn't stop reading it"" is overused, but that was literally true for this one, more so than any other book I have ever read. I stayed up all night reading it. I wish I could find the copy I had. I wonder where I got it? I wonder what I did with it? (I mean, it's not the best book I ever read overall, but it sure was interesting!)"
2,Good for references,"I am reviewing this book as a possibility for use in a master's-level class. The one advantage I see of this book is that it provides a large list of references for each subject. However, the pictures are very poor quality, and the text is difficult to read. Furthermore, the descriptions of analytical techniques are often worse than those presented in the original journal articles. Hence, I plan to use the journal articles referenced in this book as a basis for the class, but to return the actual book itself. It's a shame to see a text with this much potential end up looking this poor in quality."
4,"it's a plastic box, my cat uses as a toilet!","I got a pretty good color, I read some reviews that it wasn't a pretty color, but mine isn't bad.Not that it would matter, it's a cat pan, in my laundry room. But she USES it, and that's what I need. She's not a huge cat, so she's not knocking out litter or anything.I think it was a good buy."
4,A little too large for my cat,"This is an excellent product, but be sure to check the dimensions well, before ordering. I eye-balled the dimensions and ended up with a box that was too big for my cat. No problem, as I gave it away to a friend, but just a friendly suggestion for future buyers - check the size!"
2,Teeny tiny,"It's fine, but not big enough for two kittens. They pretty much go through the litter in a day. Sometimes they both try to use it at the same time. Cute, but not practical. I'd recommend the scoop though."
3,Great for a 2 month old kitten,This litterbox is VERY small. I don't think I full sized cat would enjoy using this and it would probably be messy. However for my 2 month old kitten this works fine. The small size help me put an extra one around the house to help with her training. Even for a small kitten though I think it's worth getting a larger one. Less litter splash that way.
3,medium is small,"two of these medium sized pan are the size of one large. Aside from that, they are fine. Kitten sized. I'd hate to see the small sized ones!"
4,Kennel work,"In a kennel area, it is really nice to have these compact litter boxes that don't take up the entire cage. The cats enjoy it too, since they have more room to move and play, and they tend to get less cat litter tracked everywhere--which means it also stays out of their food and water bowls. However, very young kittens or adult large cats should probably have a bigger box because they tend to miss from the lack of room."
4,"Good,maybe a little bigger?","Is good,my one cat is not missing as much. Needs the lip on the side like my old smaller one did to keep the litter in the box. Cats like to borrow and build mountains after doing there business. Good product would recommend if this is the largest box you can get,why not not to expensive. Someday there will be a box that will not have any problems us cat lovers know about with owning these cute furry little creatures."
