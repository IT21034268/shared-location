2,"WAY TO HARD TO READ, DISAPPOINTED","This book has a ton of great information, and has been very helpful. But I have to agree that it is filled with typos, which makes them look bad. BUT the HUGE problem with this book it the text is too freaking small. Theseidiot 's should have known this being graphic designers/printers, it is SO hard to read. They made the text at about a 9 or 10 point. And no, I am not farsighted, or really old and can't see, I am a young graphic designer, but find it VERY hard to read this text.Because of this I wouldn't reccommend this book, find a different book that knows how to spell, and knows not to make the reading text a 9 point"
4,"good book, bad trasnslation","This book offers tons of good information in a nicely designed format, but you can tell it has been translated into English. The grammar is terrible and there are misspelled running rampant throughout the pages. I'd recommend it, but be aware that some of the passages are hard to interpret because of the language barrier."
2,Disappointed,I purchased this to use with simmering fragrance oils. The pot is attractive but produces very little scent...even after we had added more oil to the water. The only way to smell the oil was to remove the pot lid and even then it produced very little scent. I would not recommend this product...purchase a pot that resembles small crockpots--they keep liquids at a higher temp.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This product produces absolutely no scent and barely gets warm. I traveled 3 hours (there and back) by public transit to purchase this at WalMart and it is completely worthless. You would be better off simmering something on the stove or adding plain hot tap water to herbs to produce a scent. What a waste of time, effort and $$! JJ"
2,It does't scent even a small room.,"It's a pretty pot, but that's all. I bought mine locally, and the picture on the box appears dark purple, but the pot is actually black. Still looked nice, but I could only smell the essential oils (and I used high quality ones and a lot of them!) when my nose was directly over the pot. I also tried high quality organically grown lavender and rose petals with the same negative result. I returned the pot, and am still searching for the perfect electric room scenter (simmer pot, potpourri pot, tart warmer, or whatever) that can used with essential oils, and occasionally potpourri. I've used pots heated with tea lights, but the candles burn down too quickly and are a hassle to keep replacing."
3,Works as advertised,These arrived on time and worked as advertised. They did not fit my chairs but that was due to my error not a shortcoming of the product.
4,Better than expected,"The product was exactly as advertised. I ordered 4 packages, one set for each chair. each cap fit exactly and snugly to the chair legs. They do not mar the floors and keep the chairs from slipping."
4,"Quite Likely, Really","Lurking betwixt the whacky covers which feature gray Gray art, are these brilliantly witty little tales which explode between your ears. Think of Vonnegut, Kafka, even Philip Dick, or the late great Robert Altman's shock/horror movie,'Images'. No, this is not the comfort zone, but the stimulation zone, the traveller's tonic...the world re-mapped in Surrealist vent and the colonisers' grasp in all the wrong places. Powers are misplaced and misappropriated. Vasco Pyjama(thank you Michael Leunig) is out there at the far edge of consciousness. Start anywhere in the collection (though they're arranged chronologically for those so fixed on 'development'). Anyway, I'd start with'The Spread of Ian Nichol' as a primier and don't draw breath until you've finished,'The Axel Tree' with its Swiftian swipe at Modernism. Go Alisdair! This is my grey pick since its advent to my shelves during a bitter mid 1990s winter."
1,Dissapointing,"Bought this book at a climbing shop because at first glance it looked decent. I got home and looked at some of the peaks I have already climbed that are listed in the book. Matterhorn Peak is at least 12 miles, my computer showed the gain at closer to 5500' than the 51xx' listed. And 9 miles round trip for Mt. Ritter??? WHAT! Most accounts I have seen show it as 9 miles one way and closer to 6700' gain rather than the 4757' listed. Taking the information presented in this guide could get you in trouble. How am I supposed to believe the rest of the guide?"
2,Needs Work,"This book has a very tough goal: to summarize routes that novice climbers/hikers can follow to the summits of California's more accessable peaks. However, it falls short on several counts. The route descriptions are rudementary at best. The lack of photos introduces severe abiguities that can lead novice climbers into trouble. Many of the route descriptions are out of date and need revision. A route described for a given peak may actually be more difficult than other known routes up the same peak (e.g. Mt. Morrison). This book could easily be twice as thick with photos and more detailed route descriptions. I hope that the author significantly updates the text in future additions. It has the makings of a classic in California mountaineering!"
2,The Military Industrial Complex--Misson Creep,"One cannot help but realize the ""fantasy"" that surrounds the Military Industrial Complex (MIC) and the operative theories used to support the institutions of war. Top level personnel have long forgotten the history and constitutional constraints placed on a democracy in using power to affect more than domestic issues.Terms such as LRC, MRC, OOTW, and political support by the DoD to suit particular political objectives is nothing more than over reach by the Pentagon. The pentagon should be focused on constraint (last resort), relevance, and efficacy as opposed to ""Shock and Awe."" The authors envision a military mission that can do anything--irrespective of constitutional constraints. For example, the constitution explicitly forbids the formation of a ""permanent"" army. The framers of the constitution understood that standing armies where the instruments of tyrants."
3,The basis of Hitler's blitzkrieg,"Shock And Awe were the foundational concepts put forth by Hitler's military leaders as a new and lethal way of rapidly overwhelming opponents. Setting aside considerations of the violence visited on civilians and non-combatants or the damage done to infrastructure, Hitler suggested that inducing ""shock and awe"" through his ""lightning war"" system would lead to rapid military victories. WWII showed that, at least at the level of individual battles, he was right. The authors suggest this is a powerful strategy for any nation that wants to absolutely and rapidly overwhelm its opponents, and doesn't much care who gets killed in the process. Interesting reading, although it rambles a bit and blitzkrieg is often misspelled. Good instruction to any military that wants to undertake fascistic extranational adventures."
4,Noir Novelist,"No other mystery writer today captures the essence of noir as well as Thomas Cook. The review amazon has pegged as their ""Spotlight"" review misses the point if this is the first of his books that they have read. His stories are more character driven than plot driven; they are more instrospective, moody, atmospheric, and for me, they never fall short. If the ""Spotlight"" reviewer didn't get the ending, it's because Mr. Cook's hallmark is that his clever intracies don't become evident until the end. He's almost impossible to outguess."
4,another great read,"Cook's books can be dark and a little depressing, but his prose is top notch. His plots are intricate without insulting the reader. Yes, some of the circumstances are very hard to buy, but he writes it in such a way that its not unbelievable.He has become one of my new favorite writers."
3,the interrogation,"Just not up to Mr. Cook's standard. Thomas Cook has written some of my favorite books (Evidence of Blood, The Chatham School Affair, Heartbreak Hill, Places in the Heart, Instrument of Blood). But this one is not in the same class with these other books."
2,BORING!,read about 80 percent of the book and just gave up. there was no surprise or suspense whatsoever. the book was so redundant and dry. i read Places in the Dark and that was a pretty good book. this one was a complete disappointment!
3,For anybody but Cook it would be a 5 ...,"This is a very good, well-written mystery, but, since Thomas Cook writes absolutely phenomenal mystery-novels (The Chatham School Affair, Places in the Dark), for him, it's merely OK.The story is driven by a deadline early tomorrow morning to either get a confession or release the suspect, i.e., an all-night interrogation of a weak, seemingly pathetic little character, Albert Smalls, who later proves more legitimate than you would have anticipated.With two detectives, and a couple of actively-involved, somewhat politically-driven (surprise!) superiors, the curious aspect is that one detective leaves the investigation to go try to run down a minor clue - other than sweating the guy, it's all they have to work with. In the process of the dual inside - outside stories, the whole thing unfolds very nicely. You certaintly can't see the resolution coming. Recommended, but not as highly as some of his others ..."
5,It's my inner tube experince all over again!,"This time I took a chance with this cute dragon and thought he'd be good for my overweight body. I was VERY wrong! When I tried getting on him, guess what... HE POPPED! But, I didn't know he popped, but that wasn't for a while, which is weird. Anyway, if your kids are heavy, don't get this, otherwise, he's a good, but not very easy to tame dragon!"
5,Wonderful book,"This is a great book for beginning collector of Blue and White Pottery. It gives a great English view of Engish blue and white, and pictures are wonderful. Very rare pieces, how to collect, all three of her books are well worth the price for collectors in the U.S."
1,Cross gone Chinese,"I was very dissapointed when i received this refill, and used it. The Chines have vanished its quality, so it's a pitty for a cross refill to write like a 1cent pen. The ink spreads terribly when you write, and its not comfortable and smooth when writting."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED - only 1 refill,"When I received the package, there was only a single refill in it, even though they advertised it as a ""case of 12 refills.""They said that there was a mistake in the description and that they would fix it, and they did refund my money.I wasn't going to write a bad review as they did refund my money, and I understand making mistakes. However, they never fixed the description, which leads me to believe that they are deliberately mis-advertising the product to mislead customers."
4,A Good Jump Start,"This book is a pretty good introduction into the basics of psychology. It explains the different perspectives and approaches to studying the mind and the different therapies used to treat disorders and undesirable behavior. The illustrations are rather helpful, and there are insights into the history of this science. It's worth a quick study for someone who may be thinking of making psychology their college major or considering therapy or counseling for him/herself."
1,"AWFUL BOOK, TO BASE A GREAT MOVIE ON","I read the book ARMAGEDDON before I actually saw the movie and as a result I was so glad that when I saw the movie it was nothing like the book. The book is unispiring and often silly it dosen't give you a good chance to know the characters at all. Espically HENRY STAMPER, he seems physchotic almost at times, certinatley not somebody you'd send to save the world like in the movie more like the looney bin. Grace seemed to be kind of a uninteresting charachter as well not like she was potrayed in the movie. My advice skip the book and see the movie."
2,What a bad job.,"I saw the movie ""Armageddon."" It was really good, then I bought the novel. I read it quickly, it seems M.C. Bolin was in a hurry because he didn't describe much. One thing I think he shouldn't have done was cut out Steve Buscemi's wisecracks out. It goes by the movie good, but I think in this case the movie was better then the book."
1,Ingredients?,I'm sick of Amazon food and drug/supplement sellers not listing ingredients. You honestly think I'm going to order something to pour into my dog's head without even seeing the ingredients first? Forget it
1,Not recommended...,"Both Sargeants and HARTZ products are very unsafe for your pets. In most cases they DO NOT work as intended. In some pets they cause skin redness and irritation, seizures, ongoing nervous system disorders, and death."
1,Postmodern nonsense,"Here's a big heads up. Although I have the deepest respect for Philippe Petit, ( he was the guy that walked across a wire between the twin towers in New York). Petit does an admirable job of trying to tease out what the heck Baudrillard is trying to say. And some of the things he says make a certain amount of sense, it is just that the way he says it that is the problem. This is a great instantiation of taking a few good ideas and killing them with circular, redundant, boring prose; the sure ""tell"" of a postmodern mind caught in its own web of obfuscation."
5,WOW?????????,These are beautiful and what a great price. I love them and would order again. These look very expensive and let me say the company really packaged these very well.
2,A little disappointed :(,"I received my deflector in good shape and with fast service, which is why I like Amazon. When I went to install the deflector I noticed I had 4 holes, but only 3 fasteners, which apparently are for another vehicle since they were to small for the hole. I tried to google GTS to see if they could send the a package of the right fasteners, but gave up. GTS is too darn hard to find through google. I could've easily given them a higher score if they had made my purchase more simple and sent the right package of fasteners."
4,4-stars! rules,"The Summer of the is a great book of much joy and sadness withn a blend of suspense thrown in.The story is about an unhappy insecure girl named Sara whos brothers mentally retarted who insists that they go see the swans. Wanda Saras sister is basically the anti-Sara.Betsy Byars wrote an excellent book full of many feelings this book was great!Overall this book is a mixed division of chracters with funny, sad,and insecure chracters also thrown in. I reccomend this book to all ages"
2,I didn't like this book,"This book is about a girl named Sara and her brother Charlie.Sara is always thinking that she is ugly and sees only the bad things of her life.She is kind of jealous of her sister because she thinks Wanda is beautiful.She loves his brother but some times she is desperate with him. She wants to go away but at the same time no, but on day his brother go and gets lost. Sara is desperate looking for him, it seems that no one will find him but at the end Sara finds him. After that she realise that her father didn't go because he want to, but for what he thinks is better for his family. And at the end Sara changes her thoughts and feelings about her familly."
4,pleasant,"An authentic and pleasant story of a girl with a handicapped brother. She feels tied down until her brother becomes lost. Then she learns to see her rivals, her brother, and her absent father in new ways. A book to recommend to students 11-15 as it authentically describes adolescent issues vis a vis family and peers. Insightful."
4,The Summer of the Swans,"I liked this book, and i would tell people to read it. this book is about a girl named sara who is having the worst summer of her life..... She live with her Aunt Willie....She have a brother named charlie, and a sister named Wanda.....Her brother Charlie is mentally retarded......One day she took the short cut through the woods when Aunt Willie told her not to her brother to see the beautiful swans they leave...Her brother leave buring the night to see the swans and get lost his way there....Sara and Joe Melby go out looking for him....they found him he took the short cut through the woods and got lost."
4,summer of the swans,"Summer of the Swans is a good book but it mostly about Sara finding Charile. Its a little hard to keep up with.I like this book because its funny, the stuff that they say. I also like the ending and how Sara and Joe start to become friends. Sara starts to like the way she looks in the end."
4,The Summer Of The Swans,"The teenage girl has a lot of problems! She hates her big feet,her mom die,she thinks her sister Wanda is more prittie then her,he brother is mental retarted and she feels like her dad is a remote dad.And in all that her summer is the forst summer she could ever have.This book is baset on the story of Ugly Duckling.She realized that her family is most importent thing and,at the end of the book she realized that the look is not most important thing in the life.And now she feels good about her self.Its not the best book because they really did not talk about the swans.Mybe thats why they should call it Saras Summer.But it was a pretty good book."
2,A Good Try By Byars,"I thought this book was ok because I like mystery and action books. This book did not have much excitement or anything. There was a high climax in the story but really nothing else. The ending was not good. The author should have continued the story a bit farther. She should have made a better ending. I also thought that it was very predictable. If you like books without a good ending, read this book!!"
3,A Light Read....,"This book was okay. I liked the fact that it dealt with real-life issues, such as death, innatentive parents, the pressure of perfect older siblings, and mental disabilities. But I did feel that the search for Charlie could have been played up a bit more, because it felt to me like a walk through the woods with a complaining friend. If you're looking for some sophisticated literature, go read Little Women or Oliver Twist. This was a light read for me-I read it in one day."
2,Summer of the Swans,"I think Summer of the Swans was an OK book because it didn't have that much action in it. I would recomend this book to kids who just love reading boring books.If the kids taht like to read an exciting book, well, then I wouldn't recomend them this book.But even though it was boring, Betsy Byars did a really good job at making the characters seem as if they were real. That's why I put two stars instead of just one."
2,Matts review,this book was not one of my favorties. i thought some parts were good but others were boring. i would rather of read a different book but this book was ok
2,Summer of the swans,I didn't like the book very much because it did not have a lot of action. The book only talked about how you would act in a family.
2,Book Review,"This book, The Summer of the Swans was really boring. Most of the things in the book was really pointless. It did not have a good plot. I think the book is for younger kids, like around 11. I would have rather read a book that was more entertaining."
1,"If you are critical of bad writing, don't read this book!","I read this book in sixth grade. As a sixth grader, I didn't look at novels the way I do now, but I hated it anyway. Ignoring writing conventions, plot, theme, and description, it is just plain boring. I'll read anything, and it bored me when I was a little kid! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a brain"
3,The Summer of the Swans,"I personally did not like The Summer of the Swans by Betsy Byars. This book did not move along fast enough for me. There was not enough action happening. But if you want to learn some lessons of life, I recommend it.This book is about a girl named Sara and her brother, Charlie. Charlie is mentally challenged. Sara is a ""poor, poor no one likes me"" kind. The plot is just the two of them going to see the swans and the story starts to build up from that. Charlie likes the swans. Charlie sees what he thinks is a swan and try's to go back were he first saw the swans, but takes a wrong turn.This book teaches a few lessons. One is don't judge yourself because of what you look like. Another is don't be too overprotective of your family because too much is as bad as not enough. Another, is give yourself time to change."
5,"""The Summer of the Swans","""The Summer of the Swans,""is about a girl, named Sara Godfrey who thinks too much of herself and her appearence. She has a dog named Boysie who is always sleeping. She also has a sister, Wanda, and a brother, Charlie. Charlie is mentally handicapped and does not speak. One night, Charlie decides to go see the swans by himself and gets lost.Their mom died and their dad lives in Ohio. Their Aunt Willie takes care of them.My favorite character is Boysie because he is always quiet and calm. He's a gentle, loving dog. Boysie doesn't like people crying, especially Sara. When Sara wants attention she cries.I liked, ""The Summer of the Swans,"" because at the end Sara doesn't think so much of herself, but of others, too.I would recommend this book to other people."
1,Boring book,"I think that this book is really boring. There are no adventures or mystery.The book is also really short, there are only a few pages on each chapter and the book has a really lame and usual ending. Happily ever after. The book ends with finding Charlie and Sara has a boyfriend. Almost all books are like that. The only part I like is when Charlie was lost. It tells us what he feels and what he does. I hope the people will like this book, even if I don't like it.:)Anna ZhaoGrade Six"
3,It Depends What You Like.......,"It depends what you like, It was just ok in my mind. I liked some aspects of the book. It had a great story line but it didnt end to my liking. If you like happy endings would recommend it for sure. If you like action and nonperfect endings then don't bother. There was great symbolism in it and a good variety if characters."
2,"Ok, but not great",This story was a very heartfelt one but way too predictable. Sometimes it rattled off and left me uninterested for queit a while. I think the author tried to make it a little depressing (which can add to a book) but it came off as boring instead. It's a short and easy read though so you might want to try it; I guess it just wasn't for me.
5,A Real Page Turner,I liked this book so much! It is a mystery. This story made me anxious to see what would happen next. I can't tell you what happens but you'll love the ending. You'll have to find out yourself but trust me it's good. This book makes you want to come home and give your mom a hug. Have some kleenexes handy because you might need them.Alison Clem - 4th Grade / Arlington Elementary School / Mrs. Jacobson's Class
2,My Theory On The Summer of the Swans,"Sara Godfrey is a stubborn girl that lives with her Aunt Willie, her sister Wanda, and her mentally handicapped brother Charlie. There is a tragedy when Charlie gets lost while he is trying to find the swans he had seen earlier. When they discover Charlie is missing they have the whole town looking for. Sara discovers Charlie but, she also discovers there is more to life than the little things.My favorite character in this novel is Joe Melby. Joe Melby is a kind and clever boy who cares about Charlie and won't stop until he and Sara find him. He is very patient with Charlie. At the end of the novel he asks Sara to go with him to a party.My opinion on the novel was that it was a good book to learn from. It explains how a day with a mentally handicapped person would be. It also teaches you not just to care about the little things."
3,"Readable, but there's better out there","OK, so I was disappointed. It's not a bad book, but given this very well respected author and a Newbery Award, I thought I was in for a jewel. Regrettably, it turned out to be just a pleasant story, of a girl's summer of change from girl to young woman and her relationship with her mute and lost younger brother. The coming of age theme has been done better (see Absolutely Normal Chaos by Creech), the 'special' younger brother has been done better (see Yolanda's Genius by Fenner), and Byars herself has done better (for this reader, Wanted: Mud Blossom and The Burning Questions of Bingo Brown). Recommendable for maybe fourth or fifth grade, it's not significantly more than that."
4,The beauty of swans,"It's nearly the end of the summer and fourteen-year-old, Sara Godfrey is miserable. She's unhappy with her looks, she is overprotective of Charlie, her ten year old handicapped brother, and she misjudges everyone around her. One afternoon, Sara takes Charlie to see the swans at the nearby lake. Later that night, Charlie leaves home to look for the swans he loves so much. The plot thickens as Sara, and the rest of the town, lend a hand in the search for missing Charlie. In the end, Charlie is found, and Sara discovers she may actually be a swan."
2,A Book I Didn't Like,"The book ""Summer of the Swans"" was not my type of book. To me it was very predictable and slow, because books like this always end happily ever after. I knew from the beginning that they were going to be happy in the end. My kind of book is scary, sad, and unpredictabe, but if you like happy endings, I would definitely recommend you to read this book."
2,Bad Book by Byars,"I thought this book was okay. It had a good plot and also good symbolism. However, there was one part of the book I disliked, the ending because it didn't leave any information to sum up the story and ended blankly. I also thought this book was too predictable, because during many parts you could tell what was going to happen next. Other than those two things, I thought this book was pretty good I would recommend it for people who like happy endings in their stories."
1,Not Enough for a Newbery Medal,"The book, The Summer of The Swans, is an obviously predictable book about a selfish girl name Sara who learns right from wrong. With no action,comedy,suspence or mystery, it's just a grade school drama that doesn't deserve a Newbery Award Medal. So unless you like predictble grade school books about what's important in life and a brother getting lost, this book isn't for you."
3,the summer reveiw,I enjoy the book because it has expression like when sara says she's miserable. I really like that. the thing I like about this book is the ending when joe asked sara if she wants to go to the party it was a happy ending. I would recommend it becase it is really a good book. I think that everyone should read it.
1,The Summer of the swans,"I think the book summer of the swans was not good or bad,it was just okay.I liked it when charlie got lost because he saw this white cat passing through the side walk and he thought It was a swan charlie is a mentally challenged kid he thinks to much and diffrent to and I liked it to when sara thinks shes ugly and that she want's to be like her sister wanda thats 19 yearold girl and the thing of the book was that wanda is to girrly girl and that wanda just wants to be so perfect and stuff well I recemmend any body who wants to read the summer of the swans."
3,summer of the swans,"i thought the book was ok even if it was to slow. The book is about a girl who goes into her teenage years and has to bring along her mentally challenged brother,charlie,everywhere she goes. then they go see the swans.after they leave,that night charlie gets lost in the woods.The reason for the story is ""you don't know what you have until it's gone"". I thought this book was out of place because it brings all the characters in middle of the story. i recommend it to people who are intersted in boring slow books."
1,oskars review,"The summer of the swans is a intresting book for younger kids.It is about a poore family. Sara and Charlie they were brother and sisers, the mother of them died when they were small kids and their father works a long way from the house were they live.Charlie cant speek since he was 3 years old s he has a handicap. Aunt Willi takes over the mothers role in the house and she looks for charlie and sara. Only one think happend in the story that was that Charlie went away from his house and Sara and Aunt Willi had to search for him. Sara and Aunt Willi were very nervouse because they told Saras father that they would look after him very good, and finally the had found him. Thats all about this book."
4,A Touching Story,I loved this story because it's very touching. I have really thought about my actions around my sister and it really inspired me.
5,Hard growing up?,Reviewer: JillThis story takes place in west Virginia. Is it hard growing up? Well see how hard it can be when you are the middle child. You think that everyone is ignoring you and you don't count. See what happens to Sara as she grows up in the span of one summer.
1,"Waste of Time, Money, Paper, Ink, and Most of All a Newbery Medal","I thought this book was horrible. For one thing, it was so predictable. Once the book hit the climax, I knew exactly what was going to happen. Also, I thought this book was very dull and boring. I for one like books with a lot of action. The ending was the worst part of all. It got me to a part with a lot of suspense and just left me hanging. Overall, this book was a waste of my time."
3,An OK Book !,"I liked this book, because it had a nice plot. I didnt really like the ending. It was very predictable. I thought they could have gone a little further to tell about Saras' father."
5,Wow! What a great book!,"The book The Summer of the Swans was a great book. It included alot of details and made you think a little. It's a tale of a young girl growing up. It also has a Newbery Award, so people agree with me. It is a book for anybody young or old. I hope you make the right chocie, and buy this book."
2,Don't Buy Byars' Book,I liked and disliked this book because at times it was good. I disliked this book because it was predictible. You knew what was going to happen. Last I did not like the ending at all. The book could have gone on a little longer to make the ending of the book better.
4,The Summer of the Swans,"It's about a girl named Sara who lives with her Aunt Willie, sister and brother. Her brother's name is Charlie. When he was little he had a high fever and since then he has not talked or laughed. The only thing Sara does is take care of Charlie. One day Sara takes Charlie to see the swans at the pond. Charlie likes the swans a lot. Then at night he goes to find them. Instead he gets lost in the forest. Then the next day they find out that Charlie is missing. So Sara goes to look for him. Will Sara find Charlie? If you want to find out read the book.I will give this book 4 stars. It was really interesting when Charlie got lost. It was so exciting that I could feel what Sara was feeling when Charlie got lost. You can see what is happening, the author really explained it well. It makes you want to read more when you stop reading. I would pick this book as one of my favorites. READ IT NOW!Gladys GarciaMadison, Wi."
1,Worst Book By Far,Okay I was forced to read this awful book in school and hated every word of it. It is truly THE most boring book ever. Hands down. Plot? NO. Adventure? NO. Suspense? NO. Anything Interesting? NO.
4,It is an okay book,"This book would be better if it was longer more dramatic and more cliff hangers, and if all the characters that were mentioned were mentioned a bit more so that every thing links together and that would be a perfect book :-) YAY"
1,I hated this book!!!!,"It was terrible, it was EXTREAMLY borring... I would't recomend this stupid book to anyone... It works like a sleeping pill!!! So borring, and so predictable... This is the most annoying and stupid book I ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,an uneventful book,I found the summer of the swans very boing and uneventful. There was not much goin on and it was not somthing I was interested in. There were very few interesting parts of this book. and I found the story didnt really have a very sturdy plot to it. There was not really any piont to it and I would have read a rather book instead. You may end up liking this book but i didnt really like it.
1,"Keep on walking buddy,nothing to see here.","All of these films are pretty bad. The film quality is low and they suck for the most part. Bad fighting horrible acting,weak plots. The only decent one is snake crane secret. I liked the bad guy in snake crain secret. Get this if you have a few bucks left over to waste."
4,Great designs,"I didn't use this book as it was intended, but instead traced the designs onto fabric using the tip of a knitting needle and dressmaker's carbon paper, thus increasing its value for me. Clear, beautiful designs are what you get with this book - just not a whole lot of them."
1,Thery don't have what they list on Amazon,"I would like to say I find this to be a good product. But this company canceled this part of my multi-item order. I went on Amazon the same day of cancellation and they still listed it for sale, apparently in-stock. So I found the same thing at Sam's Club for cheaper once you factor in the astronomically high shipping charge."
4,great to have on hand,for dried onions this is a great little package to have on hand. I add to soups and and other cooking dishes. I also hydrate some to saute to add to scrambled eggs. Good enough!
2,Where's the blimp?,"...okay, I know it's a rigid airship and not a blimp, but this model is soooo unbelievably small that I couldn't resist. The product dimensions given are for the box, not the model, the model itself is literally thumb-size, so it can't even be displayed. Disappointing. Doesn't anyone make a reasonably sized model that isn't $500?"
2,Too small to be fun,"The product was delivered on time and in good condition, but was so small that it would be of little use or fun."
4,FROM HOLLAND WITH LOVE,"real good concert, enjoyed it very much, love some of the music I have not heard him play before, still a few familiar faces still with him. his shows have got a lot better and more variety in them. excellent"
3,Simple twist of fate,"""Blind Chance"" (made in 1981) explores three possible outcomes of a young traveler's attempts to catch a fast-moving train. Paranoia runs deep in this, the most political of Krzysztof Kieslowski's early feature films (its release was delayed for years because of censors). Boguslaw Linda is terrific as the resourceful medical student slapped around by fate. This is one of four recent additions to Kino's Kieslowski collection -- along with ""No End,"" ""Camera Buff"" and ""The Scar"" -- all of which show that the Polish master's writing and directing skills arrived almost fully formed when he turned to feature films. Each of the films benefits from a powerful central performance. They are products of the 1970s and '80s, a time of vast sociopolitical changes in Poland, but are not timepieces or simplistic attacks on the communists. The color images (full frame, enhanced for widescreen TVs) and sound are adequate. Subtitles are clear."
3,Not essential,"Essential perhaps for instro-maniacs, but for surf afficionados this album doesn't bring much new to the table. Pete Curry plays all the accompanying instruments (drums, bass, and piano) except sax. This album lacks the fury and innovation of early Los Straitjacket albums, and is more in line with their recent efforts (Velvet Touch, Supersonic Guitars). Not that its a bad rendition; Angel plays the songs as Wray played them, clean and flawlessly. Unfortunately, there is no new interpretation to the music, its just Link Wray repeated. Why not pick up the Link Wray ""Rumble! Best of"" album instead? Its cheap, and the originals, with their heavy reverb and dated sound, still have more life than this revisit."
4,Weaving with 3 Rigid heddles,This book is very well written. The author goes into the basics of threading 3 heddles with good diagrams. He also covers twills and doubleweave. I would highly recommend it.
5,Bless Rabbi Mariner!,"As a psychologist who conducted my dissertation research on the importance of spirituality in our lives, I studied a wide variety of world religions. As a non-Jew, I have always been drawn to the Jewish faith, and have longed for years to read the Torah in its original Hebrew. I realized, however, that studying Hebrew to that end would take years of study and hoped to find, consequently, an accurately translated Torah in the English language. Blessings on Rabbi Mariner for answering my prayers! As someone who was raised in the Protestant religions, I am readily able to detect the differences between the versions of The Five Books of Moses (Genesis through Deuteronomy) I have previously read. Consequently, I feel for the first time in my life that I am truly reading the Word of God.Dr. Patricia McWhorterLicensed Psychologist"
1,unfortunately disappointed,"I actually bought 2 copies of this book - one for myself and one for a friend. I bought it specifically because of the positive review written about the author. When they arrived and I opened one of them, I was dismayed to find that the print was so small that I had trouble reading it with my glasses on. Too bad - I am returning them."
1,Please give the correct translation,"the correct translation is not "" IN THE beginning God created the heaven and the earth """
3,What the?????,"Ok, I'm a big fan of O'Donoughue. However, this thing is seriously weird. If you dig the surreal, this flick's for you. This is VERY surreal."
1,"ick, ick ick!","This book is absolutely one of the worst I have ever read. Brown may be one of the most talented authors in America, but I'm sure as heck not liable to read anything else she's written after this. This is basically a long, masturbatory ""what would happen if"" fantasy spun out into novel form, with some jarring out-of-context sex tacked on at the end. Brown's success writing other fiction must be the reason such worthless drivel could be published in the first place. I can't believe it's rated so highly here--in fact, the reason I looked it up in the first place is because I wanted to see how badly it had fared at the hands of Amazon critics! Wow. Doesn't the title_alone_give anyone a clue?"
4,College Prep Review: Venus Envy,"Venus Envy was an enjoyeble book that got my attention and kept it the entire way through. The relationships between the main character, Frazier, and her family and friends, were developed so well that you were screeming at the book when her mother would call, and wishing that you had a friend like Mandy, her best friend.Through her characters Brown shows a very realistic view of the pressures homosexual women feel. In her impressive character developement of Frazier she shows the fears an American woman may have of coming out. Such as being feared by parents and losing money in her business.Over all Venus Envy was a well written book that showed true friends are the ones who accept you for who you are. I would recommend reading this book. And I look forward to rading more of Brown's books."
2,Stop before you reach the end,"Others have said it but I'll say it again. Great premise, interesting book (despite flaws and a few images I could do without), but what was with the Olympian gods? I can safely say that without it being a spoiler because it has nothing to do with the plot although it takes up the last 60+ pages.Also, the conversations between Frazier and Mandy seemed contrived. Nobody talks like that in real life; they were obviously characters in a book. It was also really preachy."
3,Lost story line,"I read the description of the book so I was not surprised at the content, and true to MS. Brown's writing, she captures you with her characters. I was happy with the book until the end, when it seems she didn't know how to end the story and ended up with a fantasy segment that seemed strangely different from the rest of the book! What happened, did Sneaky Pie come in to finish the book for her?"
1,Expectations are prearranged resentments,"Upon finding this ""liberal"" novel in my conservative, college library, I was quite interested to read the author's views about homosexuality in southern aristocratic culture. The beginning of the story grabbed my attention with Frazier's near-death experience and her subsequent ""outing"" to her friends and family. However, by the second half of the book I was wondering if the author had a point to make, or even a plot. The conclusion of the novel was highly disappointing because the author forgot about the minimal plot she had developed and proceeded to display highly controversial political messages in the form of Frazier's interactions with greek mythological characters. All in all, Rita Mae Brown could have spent more time on character and plot development, and less time on the southern scenery she so loves to describe. If you are expecting to read an interesting and open-minded novel, chose something else, or you'll resent the time wasted."
2,Disappointment,I have read a number of the author's books and enjoyed them all which is why I chose to read Venus Envy. I was very disappointed in this book. In my mind is was nothing more than a means to advocate alternate lifestyles and gay culture.
2,What promise this story had!,"When I started reading this book, I thought, Good ol' Rita Mae has out-done herself this time--it was the funniest, cleverist beginning of a book I have ever read--but I would rate the whole book as one of her worst. I recommend you read only the first 4 or 5 chapters--it is hilarious--but then close it up and give it to the book exchange before you get bogged down in the almost unreadable ending. I am a dyed-in-the-wool Rita Mae Brown fan--but this one really goes bad at the end. Her earlier works are much better; Rubyfruit Jungle, Six of One, and Southern Discomfort, High Hearts, and Sudden Death being her best."
3,"""Normal is just the average of deviations.""","I do like Rita Mae Brown. I share many of her notions of the world. I picked this book up as a second RMB read after reading (finally, after all these years) Rubyfruit Jungle to see what was the author and what was the story, if you know what I mean. The premise of the book is great fun! I must say though that reading this book felt like living in someone else's head as they worked through their processes, demons, angels, trying to convince themselves (& the reader). That grew a bit tiresome, esp. towards the end. While Rita can turn a phrase nicely, I found, generally, her dialog was preachy, a little too unnatural for conversation, her arguments a tad pat, abet ""unconventionally"" so. I will read more Rita Mae."
2,Showed promise but a disappointing ending,"I read this book and it began really well, and I thought that the story had promise but when I read the last quarter of this book, it got really boring, and had to put it down. The book started off well showing promise but faltering at the end. I was disappointed. The ending should have been better."
2,Lazy writing,"I thought the beginning of this book was GREAT! So funny and smart. And then it's not. One specific complaint is she has one of the characters go on a page-long tirade against Michael Milken and Reagan and other evil people from the 80s. It seems like she wanted to say these things and instead of cleverly weaving her opinions into her story through her character, she just has them say it, even when it hurts the flow of the story. It seemed lazy. And that was a problem throughout the book for me; good idea but poorly executed."
3,Did not have a pleasing truffle taste,The truffle oils that I purchased in the past had a strong truffle smell and flavor. You only need a little to get a full bouquet. This truffle oil barely tasted like truffles. I wound up using it like I would regular olive oil.
3,Needs more research,"Obviously the authros didn't properly research the comics to write this sourcebook. Don't get me wrong, it's a difficult task to keep track of all these characters and things will get dated fast. But there are some obvious flaws that I've had to rewrite. Otherwise, it's pretty thorough and has groups like the MLF, Acolytes, Morlocks, and Marauders. Although, the Morlocks is missing a huge amount of members and obvious people are missing (like Wildside from the MLF, Milan from the Acolytes, etc.) The good thing is that it included a lot of people currently in Marvel Limbo. Karma, Dazzler, etc."
2,Extraordinary,"Extraordinary book! Mr. Belknap really cuts to the core of the issues surrounding the My Lai incident and the subsequent Courts Martials (Calley being the only person actually found guilty). His review of the political issues of the era as well as the personal sacrifice made by the prosecution, really help the reader understand what happened after Lt. Calley returned to the United States. Anyone interested in military justice, or who may remeber the incident and not understand fully what was involved, should pick up a copy."
4,Great Summer Read!,"This is a great book for nature lovers or anybody interested in preserving whats left of the american wilderness and its inhabitants. It is a fun read. It really put me in the mood for hiking and camping, though i have yet to attempt anything like the journey in this book. I highly reccommend it."
3,Faux fire pit,This is a very heavy frame with a nice mesh cover. However the copper is just a coating and burnt off the first use. Except for that it is very nice and provides a safe out door fire arena.
2,not satisfied with quality of this product,"The blade had small spots of what appeared to be ""rust"" on them. Enough to make me think I was getting a used product. The function seemed to work well but the rust was visible. I returned for full credit."
4,Okay knife. I demand more.,I guess there is nothing wrong with this knife-I just demand more. The price is realistic for what it is. But you could spend more and buy a Case knife and be well ahead of the game with an American made knife.Buck has been around for a long time and I don't want to knock them. I do not know where this knife is made. I could speculate.....but that's not fair.It's okay for what it is. I gave mine to a nephew and bought another Case.
3,new knife for old,"I recently got careless with an old friend. I snapped off the tip of my Buck 501 knife. I had the knife for over 30 years. Just a little PO'ed. I serched the internet and found the same model, bought it and have NO problem with Amazon. However, and its a big however, the new knife although exactly the same as my old model is not made to the same standard.The blade is fine, the wood and the finish on the handle is BELOW AVERAGE for a knife I would have expected for BUCK. The wood on the handle is not as well finished and the plating on the ends is a LOT thinner than my old knife. The rivits holding the knife's ends together are quite visible, the wood in not finished smooth and is not flush with the ends.Somewhat disappointed"
2,Returned It,"After looking extensively for a single locking blade knife about this size with a wood case, I settled on the Buck Squire. I was disappointed when it arrived, though. The wood just didn't look very nice. It appeared low-quality to my eyes and the color had a strong red tint to it, unlike the picture shown here. Otherwise, the knife was very nice--good blade, opened smoothly, locked and unlocked as it should. But since I'm looking for a nice knife to keep for decades and I wasn't happy with this one's appearance, I returned it to Amazon (with absolutely no hassles.- love how easy it is to shop here). Maybe the one I got was an anomaly and another one would have looked better, I don't know. I'm shopping around for a different knife now."
2,Very disappointed,"I had bought a few Buck knives and overall were happy with its sturdiness and craftsmanship until this one. Yes it is still sturdy as the others I had bought but the craftsmanship was absolutely lousy - the blade seems to be cut by a broken tool and it looks very coarse, and the screws underneath the nickel silver bolsters were so disturbingly conspicuous (It doesn't show on the picture.). So much for the legendary knife maker. I was going to return it but was too lazy to go through the trouble. I just bought a folding knife from Kershaw instead and I am very happy with it."
4,A good CD,"This is a nice cd, I had a great time listening to it today and remembering my old days. It's a great deal!"
2,Lightweight and pretty boring.,"Disappointing I suppose, and confirms what I felt back in the day, that Grover was a lightweight, with a lightweight smooth tone, and mediocre chops. A very good piece of background music for elegant and superficial dinner parties, very well remastered."
1,Waste of money,"When I received this item, part of the black coating (powder coating?) was already coming off around the area that was drilled for the lock. Upon attempting to install the fuel door, I discovered that the lock would not close onto the lock plate without significant trimming of the lock plate. So far I have turned the lock plate, which comes from the factory shaped like a 'C', into an 'L', and it looks like I will have to thin out the vertical section of the 'L' even more to get the lock to close. So much so as to worry me about whether the lock plate will hold together at all."
4,photoshop cs bible,This guy know his stuff. CS3 one on one is a better buy. The bible is a great referance book.
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"Honestly, I was somewhat disappointed with McClelland's Photoshop CS Bible. I have been using various versions of Photoshop for over 6 years and have bought many Photoshop how-to books for most of the versions. I hadn't gotten around to getting a book for Photoshop CS until now. What I was looking for was a very detailed book getting into the changes made for version CS and especially getting into the details of the automated and batch functions.Unfortunately this book barely touched on the specific new areas of Photoshop that I wanted to learn about, despite having over 1000 pages! I also noticed that there are only about 16 actual color pages in the whole book. For those just learning how to use Photoshop, this lack of color examples could be a real drawback."
5,Beautiful and moving holiday music,This CD is a lovely compilation of Christmas songs-both traditional and unique played by an amazingly talented group of musicians. I have had it for many years and it is a holiday tradition. I purchased it for relatives this year and know it will be loved by them as well.
3,VERY GOOD,THIS SOFTWARE WAS DEVELOPED BY A PERSON THAT WAS OFFERED A HUGE SUM OF MONEY FROM MICROSOFT TO DEVELOP THE TYPE OF FRAMEWORK FOR THEM WITH MICROSOFT LIBRARIES. JUST SO YOU KNOW...IT IS VERY POWERFUL AND THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO SOFTWARE PACKAGES THAT ARE EVEN COMPARABLE...I DO WISH THAT THEY OFFERED MORE DISPENSATIONAL MATERIAL IN THERE SCHOLARS LIBRARY...ANYWAY...HERE IS SOME PBB FILES FOR WHEN YOU BUY THE PACK...I posted free PBB files on my facebook group (they are at the bottom of links... bartimayus)[...]
5,Easy CD 7 Is The Best Version Ever,"This Media Suite will make even the pro's happy. Having said that here's why. I have used Adaptec/Roxio Easy CD since Version 2.0.1 and in all that time this by far is the largest and most complete overhaul of this already excellent software Suite ever!! And even better because of the new Engine in ECD 7 you don't have to remove the older version of the suite before you install the new version. This suite includes everything from CD burning to DVD burning and everthing in between (VCD/SVCD/PhotoCD/Capture) you name it this baby does everything. The new Help section and tutorial section is the best Help section of any software suite I have ever seen, as for all the pro's out there the Media Home GUI has a link to everything this software does so there's no hunting and searching high and low for what this puppy can do it's all right there. BUY THIS PROGRAM you will NOT be disappointed!!!!"
2,The worst version yet!,"This program is terrible. I've installed every version Roxio (Adaptec) has created and this by far sucks the most. I continued to use the program even after I noticed it was much slower than version 6. However, after installing the ""patch"" to version 7.0.1.34 or whatever number it was every video file and DVD I owned played so dark in any media player that I couldn't even see the video. Luckily I had a hunch that Roxio 7 was the problem and just uninstalled it, instead of re-doing my entire system. I'm now back to version 6.2.xxx.xxx and will stay there until they fix their problems with 7. I've never seen a company that allows such noticeable problems to be released to the public. I guess they've never heard of beta testing."
2,Generate low quality DVD movies,"I bought this product to create DVD movies. However the quality of the DVD moives are much poorer than the original DV tapes.But if you buy this product for other purposes, it might be a good choice. And that is why I give it a ""two starts""Roxio is a great company and refund all my money back with a painful process. So that I would suggest to purchase a download version if you would like to try it out by yourself."
2,difficulty in creating CDs,"There may be many media ootions with this product, but I cannot tell you how many CD-R discs I've had to throw away because of problems in creating them. Not exactly user friendly."
3,Be careful - the reviews are scary,After reading all the reviews here I am concerned about opening the copy of EMC7 that I purchased. The reviews that most concern me are the 5 star reviews that look like somebody from the marketing department at Roxio wrote. If my suspicions are true I think it is scary that a company needs to resort to this tactic to improve its rating. Read the reviews and I am sure you will see what I am referring to. These reviews are so perfectly written and formatted and cover everything from a marketing perspective. Although I have only used Roxio products before I think I will return my unopened box for a refund.
3,"Adequate, at best.","I was the previous owner of Roxio products and was satisfied. This piece of software is, at best, adequate for what it promises. Out of the box, it cannot handle dvr-ms files the format used by Microsoft Windows Media center. Roxio has an update that is supposed to be able to handle dvr-ms files, along with other fixes, but the update has caused the software to freeze numerous times, until I eventually uninstalled it and reinstalled just the original version.It's nice to have all the media capabilities together but you just be patient with this software.PS: Customer service is awful."
2,Still no dual layer support for downloaded versions,"Roxio has an update available that provides support for dual layer DVD burning. However this update is available ONLY for retail boxed versions of Roxio 7, not the download versions such as what you buy from Roxio's own store. Moral of the story: Roxio does not have an emphasis on customer satisfaction, they are ignoring much of their user base, and if you must have this product then buy it from Amazon or a physical store where you get the retail version! Better yet, check out Nero Burning ROM."
1,The video editing software is absolute garbage,"The video editing part of this software is completely useless. It didn't come with a manual and I ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it. It hasn't made a difference. The software is completely uncooperative. My computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program. If you bought this software for the video editing, I recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else."
3,"Without Broadband, Think Twice","While this program appears loaded with excellent features, you should be advised that there is a 120 megabyte update available. Obviously, without broadband connection, downloading this update is most likely out of the question. In addition, you should also be aware that the tutorials are all run on line and a broadband connection is required.For those of us who cannot get broadband (rural areas, for example), this limitation is a distinct disadvantage."
1,did not work,This would not install on my new computer with windows xp. I tried and tried finally gave up and purchased Nero and it works great so no more Roxy Products for me.
2,Doesn't work with widescreen video,"Once I figured this software out, I was able to do a slideshow of my pictures, integrate video, and produce a decent DVD. Only problem is, it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my DVD camcorder shoots in 16:9. This sucks. I have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9. Roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it doesn't support 16:9 at this time. Even in the new 7.5 version. Roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen."
1,Garbage,"I have had countless problems since installing this software. The software did not work properly, so I uninstalled and reloaded it. This did not fix the problem. Worse yet, installing the Roxio software also messed up my Windows Media Player somehow. I e-mailed Roxio about the problem and got no reply. So then I Googled the error message I get whenever I insert a cd, and I found a message board where many people have posted complaints about the same problem. Evidently, the best response anybody got from Roxio was: ""Buy an upgrade to fix the problem."" Gee, thanks a lot.If you are tempted to buy anything from Roxio, I would suggest that you simply download a virus into your computer instead--you'll get the same results but without paying for it."
1,Dont expect help from Roxio,"Review: I have had this product for 2 months and havent been able to use it because I need the updates and I havent been able to download them. Customer Service is in Canada and the usual wait time is 10 minutes. I ordered the update disc on Feb 16 - was notified it was shipped on Feb 28 - today is March 18 and it still hasnt arrived. Phoning customer service is a waste of time because all they can stay is ""It's in the mail""."
5,Must Have Product if you own a Digital Camera or DV Camera,"Creator 7 packs a punch, with all the functionality it offers. It does everything you need from backing up your data and burning discs, to creating audio/MP3 CDs, to editing photos and videos, to creating slide shows and videos, to mastering DVDs, whew! A must have companion for anyone with a digital camera or digital video camera."
2,use caution with this program,"I have Direct CD and Easy CD creator from Adaptec V4.5 or so. This program works fine so when Roxio, who bought the rights to these programs offered me the new Roxio version, I took it and it destroyed the Direct CD possibilities. Since I use this Direct CD feature as a drag and drop for my backups and as a 750 meg hard drive, I feel that this new Roxio porogram is a no-no for those who have the old Adaptec one.Since I have only tried it once, I have to say, use caution and have a good backup handy."
2,Big Disappointment,"I tried five times to author a DVD. Each time the visual quality was awful, and the audio was totally out of synch. Tech support is almost non-existent. I switched to Sonic MyDVD and it worked flawlessly the first time.Burning regular Audio CDs is fine, but any program can do that. I would stay away from this bloated package."
1,Garbage... Waste of time and money,"I believe that anyone that gives this software more than one star, probably works for Roxio."
1,Disappointing Upgrade,"I was extremely disappointed in this ""upgrade"". I had Roxio's Easy CD Creator 5 and loved it. That product allowed you to easily arrange your music on the dics, burn it, then create a lable or insert for the disc with almost no effort. Almost everything was intuitive.Creator 7 is a big step back in ease of use and utility. So they added a few new bells and whistles, so what? The base use of this product is to make music cd's and to create inserts. Arranging music is not as easy as it was before. And the insert creator is so frustrating to use I don't bother.In fact, I have continued to use Creator 5 and have simply written off the fact I paid $100 for Creator 7 - for nothing!Now, with a computer upgrade, Creator 5 no longer works. I don't dare try another Roxio product (just read the reviews for 7.5 and that appears to be a total waste of money). I'll be taking my chances on ANYTHING else . . . not Roxio."
1,Infuriating,"This is the first time I've been motivated to leave feedback on a product - it is THAT poor. The DVD builder - one of the main reasons I bought the package - is dire. You can't rename chapters (you need to be content with 1, 2, 3 etc). The ""help"" function is farcical, and my PC spent four hours encoding the DVD I wrote, only to give the prompt ""Error"". That's right - no clue on the problem, whether it was a bug, or something I'd done ... just ""error"". The error was mine putting my trust in this shoddy waste of time.Avoid at all costs."
2,SOOOOOO Slow,"I used the Roxio 6.0 software and loved it, HOWEVER the 7 Creator software is so slow, my 85 year old Aunt could run faster. It is buggy with XP software, crashes all the time and crashes sometimes in the middle of burning a CD. (...) If I had kept my old software, I would have reinstalled it and not ever upgraded to the 7 software. If you are reading this and have a better recommedation, please let me know"
3,"A so-so program, disappointed.","Used Roxio Media Creator 7 for a month now and feel like to provide some feedback. Creator 7 is improved over Creator 6, but it's just another so-so program afterall. Personally find some/several problems with the design of user interface, default floder location, confusion in the messages and selection. Biggest problem is that audio is 3 second behind the video (audio lag) in DVD authoring, a big pain and does not appears to have a fix from Roxio support website. Overall impression is that this is not a mature product yet, still a long way to go. I have spend the money so I have to find a way to work it out, you should avoid it if you can. Not recommanded."
3,Just OK,"bbThis program might be great, but without a manual or technical support, it's hard to tell. As with all previous editions of Easy CD Creator, this program has many good features. Unfortunately, they sometimes do not work properly. Roxio decided it is easier to let the consumer hunt for info rather than provide the paper manual they used to. Although technical support is supposed to be available, once you navigate the severe obstacles to real contact at the web site, their answers are less than helpful. My experience has been either no answer or a response telling me to search the knowledge base for information that I already told them I could not find. At this point, I have the program several months and do my best to not use it. It causes crashes on certain activities and,since Roxio ignores tech questions, I have no way to solve this."
1,Buggy software,"I loaded the product into XP Pro and soon went to the website and found a 52 megabyte ""upgrade"" for the program package. I downloaded it over 5 hours and installed. I have had nothing but bugs and frustrating correspondence to deal with since then. I am uninstalling it and going back to my trusty CD Creator 5 platinum software."
3,Okay if you don't need tech support,"Had problems from day one, it would not record cd in my recorder, seemed it did not like my Plextor mulit recorder. Program works on my other computer with different drives. If you need tech support, it's a joke, if you can even get thru to them. Their ""tech support"" agents don't seem to have any answers"
1,Crap! Crap! Crap!!,"This product worked for about 2 months, after that it went into the ""Dumper!"" I cannot get it to copy any CD's. I will copy the CD and then when you want to burn a copy, NOTHING! I have tried over and over to no avail. I just waste time and become frustrated. After you spend money buying this crap they want to charge you $35 or $40 to give you support, now that's real ""BULLCRAP! Don't waste money on this junk, it's really not worth it."
2,"Slow, dumbed-down bloatware","The first think I noticed about this program is that it's SLOW--it takes forever to load, and you can actually see the screen redraw. The user interface skinning is not particularly attractive, and it's obviously very inefficient--you can see it draw the background and then draw the user interface elements on top of it. And I don't have a slow computer--it's an Athlon 64 3000+ with 1GB DDR400 RAM. I shudder to think how sluggish and unresponsive it would be on a Celeron system.My other complaint is that all of the useful options have been removed. In particular, the bootable CD functionality has been gutted--it's no longer possible to slipstream a Windows install CD, which was a very useful feature for sysadmins.All I want is a fast, useful, and unobtrusive CD/DVD mastering utility, and Roxio 7 fails on all three counts."
1,10 Attempts at installation----Gave up!,"I was initially looking forward to using this software with a new high end digital camera I recently purchased. I wish I had done my research beforehand. I have tried numerous times to install the software without success. Have not had much luck with the manufacturer's support staff either. Buyer beware---like others who have posted, this software seems to be a bit ""buggy."""
1,Beware-Software Is Unreliable,"I am a graduate computer systems engineer. In my many years of experience, I have never seen such an unstable, flaky program as this Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite. It has caused operating system crashes when used with Microsoft Windows XP. Portions of the program such as the ""Tutorial"" become inoperable even after reinstalling. It is inflexible compared to other CD burn programs. I can not recommend this product."
5,Supersized capabilities for the price,"This is a real good product. It lived up to the reviews I read before making my decision. I bought it a month ago and am happy to report that I made the right choice. If you want to capture, edit and create videos or slide shows of your digital pictures/movies and then burn to DVD, this is a must have product. Plus for the price how can you go wrong."
5,CD and DVD Media Creation Just Got Easy,"Creator 7 has so many great features and capabilities that I suggest you do as I did and read the many pro reviews that thoroughly put the program through its paces. For me, my favorite and most frequently used component is storyboard, which enabled me to combine digital photos, video clips, and songs into a slideshow. It has creative features that include the ability to add transitions, titles, and a narration track. Then using the DVDbuilder component, I can create VCDs or DVDs to master my slideshow creation to disc. Overall, this is a great product for anyone dabbling or serious about working with digital media."
5,It's the best!,"Like I've been telling my friends for months, this is the best product for the price for working with digital media. It does it all, from burning CDs and backups, to editing pictures and creating videos, to mastering DVDs. It has a great interface and was very easy to learn how to use. It's a powerful program that you don't have to be a geek to appreciate."
2,no support- lousey video editing program weak recognition,"I up graded to 7 to edit and burn a DVD. I had transfered my 8mm film to a DVD. The DVD was on a VTS format which is not recognized by Creater 7. strangly it is recognized by 6. I used DivX to transfrer the file to a AVI file which was recognized. I then went to video editing nightmare. It dosn't allow you to take out snipits and save and re use. you can only change the begining and end. I tried to contact by e-mail forget it. It burns DVD's fine, but as a editing program it fails the course. I could go on about the problems with slideshow. The fact that you can not use prior productions made by 7 in a different production. all in all there must be better programs. I hate to say it but I should have followed my friends advise and gotten Nero"
5,User friendly and reliable,this user-friendly software was just what this digitally-impaired person needed. It's easy to install and even easier to use. Burning CDs is a breeze and the price is quite reasonable for all that you get
3,Roxio vs. Memories Instant Computer Scrapbook,"Roxio advantage continues to be smooth integration between photo editing and CD sharing. For ease of use and ability to link photo with titles, text, songs and songs, the newly release Memories Instant Computer Scrapbook wins hands down.[...]I think many people are already looking to go beyond generic photo organizing capabilities and looking to the new generation of software like Memories that can handle all sorts of multimedia and is very easy to use"
4,Awesome service!!,"Despite minor bugs (that have already been corrected), this application has it all, it's very intiutive and the best of all: awesome technical support!, great site!if you really want to have a fully loaded media suite, Roxio's EMC7.x must be your choice. Otherwise, you,ll have to buy separates applications"
5,Up & Running & Creating Amazing Slideshows & DVDs In No Time,"Easy Media Creator 7 works great with all forms of digital media, including data, music, photos, and video. The interface makes it easy to use and explore. The Help Center and tutorials provide good documentation, and watching the tutorial video guides really help you understand how things work. I was amazed at how quickly I was able to capture my digital camera photos, and digital video footage, and then edit and create finished slideshows and videos. The best part was how easy it was to then create some great looking DVDs. It runs just fine on my 2 GHz PC running XP. If you don't already own it, go buy it, or at least add it to your wish list, you'll be glad you did."
1,Too many bugs to count,"I purchased this product because I trusted the Roxio name and because of the positive reviews it had recieved. I was very disappointed at the number of problems I've had with the software, even after their latest patch. The programs regularly close for no apparent reason or fail to open all together. I wish I could recommend a better product, but I'm still looking for a DVD authoring program that works. The Ulead product is no better. I'm off to Pinnacle next..."
1,Roxio shafted the consumer,"The newest version of EMC7 is a loser. There are too many problems associated with getting it to run straight out of the box. AND Roxio is refusing to address them. I did not up-date to EMC7 to be met with hours of reconfiguring my computer, to enjoy the product. Now I'm out the cost of the product, that I bought through Amazon.com, with no recourse to recover my monies. At least, if I had bought it from a retailer, I might be able to recover my monies.A good offer isn't good if you get shafted.If anyone has any doubts, go to Roxio Support and read about all the problems."
1,Buyer Beware,"I'm a long time user of EZ Creator so I'm very dismayed at the poor quality of version 7. I've installed and uninstalled the product multiple times and nothing but creator classic operates. All of the other apps just give me a starting splash screen and then nothing. Videowave gives a startup error that says it can't load the config file and to reinstall it. There are no updates for the product on their support site but upon scanning the user forums, there are a lot of users with similar problems. Support is emailing patches but not posting an update. Nero 6 is buggy but more usable than than this product. I'm going back to version 5 and using Nero from now on."
1,Caution! Software is worthless without Windows XP,"Caution! Software is worthless without Windows XPThis software would not load on windows 98.On my XP computer it forces me to use resolution 1024x768.I NEVER use resolutions that high.If you do not have the latest and greatest computer,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,This is BLOATWARE,This product works sometimes (5% of time) then doesn't (95%).I've installed & uninstalled more times than Windows 95 -WASTED HOURS!!!The huge Upgrade didn't make much difference!Also read the VERY fine print with so-called special deals.NOT IMPRESSED!!
1,Awfull,Too many bugs (even the last update stops with an error!)Poor service from Roxio (standard automated replies)Still waiting for a refund...
2,Roxio Easy Media Creator 7,"When I first installed EMC7, I was pretty pleased with it. Some of the applications seemed simplistic, but they worked pretty well. Then, Roxio came out with a major update that corrected some of the issues I had noticed. I installed the update, and a good number of the programs simply stopped working. Support from Roxio is non-existant unless you pay for it. I have ended up uninstalling it, and I'll be glad to sell my copy to anyone who wants it. I'm now evaluating Nero to see if it's more stable, but there's also freeware programs for most of these functions. I'm glad to see that others haven't had problems, but I did. Just beware when you buy."
2,Media Creator WON'T Work...,"Just installed this software. For some strange reason the main page ""Media Creator Home"" will not work. It starts up, freezes, and closes itself after ~30 seconds. The creator classic works though, so i don't know what the deal is. The incredibly big upgrade did nothing to resolve that. So far i'm not so hot about this version, looks good visually, but then again so did the previous version. But annoying your costumers from day one of installation with things that don't work is not a good business strategy."
1,Video editing is not worth it,"The video editing capability is tough to deal with and not impressive when you figure it out. The tools are not explained and there isn't as much to do with it as they imply. May be nice for birthday party editing, i don't know. I didn't like it. It's not worth $100. The other capabilities might be nice,but from what i've dealt with, that's not the case."
2,"Good features, but totally unstable","The features of the program are great, but it crashes WAY too much. My computer system is fully adequate for video editing, so that is not the problem. I've gotten to the point where I save my work literally every minute for fear that it will crash."
2,Not for Beginners,"I used previous Roxio products and wanted software to start converting my Hi-8 video to DVD and better editing software for digital images. Also wanted to make some DVDs that combined photos, music and film clips.I found that after hours of work I had burned a DVD that had no sound and horrible quality vido. Using this software is not easy without someone to teach you what to do. Their previous, earlier versions were much easier to use.I also find that the ""Photo Doctor"" often highly distorts photos and any adjustments for exposure and saturation are better manually tweeked.I find that I'm only using a tiny part of this software, because I can't figure out all the rest. Even burning CDs has proven a challenge. Very few templates for CD labels and I've yet to find a list of songs that would actually fit in the template space provided."
1,Be careful when you buy this,"Like others who have posted on this one, I spent hours just trying to get this program to install. I tried on three different machines. Thought it was a funky media, which I replaced and tried again, but same problem. So I went to Roxio web page. Well, guess what? Only works with a very select list of DVDs, and mine wasn't one of them. Before you buy, check for compatibilty. Wrote complaint to FTC. Buy Nero Suite."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this movie purely because of the actresses who participated in it. Normally, Hillary Swank and Joanna Kerns are a part of some really good movies. I was very disappointed in this one though. I expected more than what the movie gave."
4,A detailed portrayal of all the collateral damage as a casualty of the fog of war.,"For the ""seadog"", a detailed description of the fight to save a doomed ship and the tragic fate of the crew that is able to get their lifeboat to a beach."
2,"Good Camera, bad software",The camera works fine unless you have a Windows Vista computer. The driver software does not run on vista. Meade Customer Service says that there is no plan to support Vista. I exchanged this camera for a Celestron NexImage Solar System Imager. It works good on Vista.
5,digital camera for the telescope,This Meade autostar digital camera works great! It's a fun way to view the stars.
1,Electric Pressure Washer,"Washer worked normally for about an hour, then the motor started to overheat popping the circuit breaker. After cool down, it would run for a short period before stopping again. Each cooldown produced a shorter and shorter work period before stoppage. Skip this one unless you like a lot of breaks."
4,Recommended!,"Just received the WK3 and used it for about one hour cleaning the side of mu house. This thing kicks!! Lots of power - lots of attachments - worked flawlessly. Would give it 5 stars (deserves 6 stars given the discounted price) but since I havent used it for a long period of time yet I am giving it 4 stars.Regarding the negative reviews. High PSI Pressure Washers draw lots of current and require a 20 amp circuit not being used by anything else during its use or it will blow a breaker. And, the build quality is very good - much better than I expected - much better than any B and D tools I have purchased and seen. Would definitely buy it again!"
4,Works as Advertised,Everything arrived in working order. Instructions were easy to follow. No complaints at all.
1,"Could not rate, din't work out of the box","The power to the unit did not work. Would not recommend this unit, spent time putting together and sending back. Amazon great at returning the unit."
5,Amazing machine,"This pressure washer worked too good for me. It gave me no problems. I am a skepticle person, so I read all the reviews from everybody and used to my advantage. I unpacked it 4 days after I received it, plugged it into the garage plug point, connected to the garden hose and voila! No issues with power cut-off or anything. What impressed me was that it uses very little water and jet streams it at great speed. It practically sat there silent until I press the trigger to spray. In the past 2 months that I have had this, I have cleaned all four sides of sidings of my house, my patio, the steps outside the front door, and the little bit of brick wall at the entrance. I had green moss on the steps, that came out and the steps look brand new. 2 years back, my son had spilled a whole can of stainer for wood on the patio, those cleaned up as if it never happenned. I love this machine and my family is very proud of my purchase. I am completely satisfied with the Sistema pressure washer."
2,Stumped,"The washer arrived but none of the extensions, lances fit into the gun. The washer is refurbished and the lances are old.I have been calling Sistema but no one picks up the phone. There's no answering machine, the line just drops.I tried sending them a note on their Contact Us page on their website, but the ""Submit"" button does not work!!!!!!Buy at your own peril."
2,Dissatisfied,"I wasn't expecting top of the line at this price, but this unit is still made quite cheaply and flimsy. Upon first using it I struggled with the motor cutting in and out. I'd have decent pressure for 2 minutes, then no pressure, then the pressure would kick back-in. This was, as you can imagine, quite frustrating.The process for returning the item to Sistema was also very frustrating. You're not dealing directly with Amazon here, but rather a ""partner"" who is not as focused on customer service as Amazon."
1,horrible,"Worked well for a very short time.Now it trips the breaker before it starts cranking out the pressure.Calling the customer service department is not much help. It feels like you're calling someone's house. They seem to know very little about the product.The hose connections are drippy.Basically this thing isn't worth your money.Trust me, don't buy it."
1,worse than garbage,"I am foolish enough to have bought TWO of these. The first didn't work, the hardware store took it back. When the second did not work, I sent it back to the company. Two weeks later I get it back, and they will not pay shipping.I highly DO NOT recomend this product."
2,"Good for engineers and scientists, but few others...","Be advised--this is not analytical geometry. It is about three dimensional technical drawing for engineers and scientists. I was surprised, since I thought three-D technical drawings were all done on CAD, not by hand. Also, the graphics were not very big, so you could lose yourself in a drawing.I found the chapter and subheadings easy to misconstrue. For instance, ""Intersection of Planes,"" was about how to draw intersecting planes, not about how to compute where they would intersect, angles of intersection, etc.If technical drawing is what you want, this review may help. Otherwise, be aware that you will not learn much else from this."
4,The end of Londa and G'kar,This is an intense story that is put together with surprising artistic direction. I love the techno-mages and i was pleased with the lead up to and conclusion of the triology. fun and fast and a great read.
4,The Last Chapter of Babylon 5,This book is nothing more than your basic 2 Hour finally for a great story that took 5 seasons to be told. It basically takes place during the last days of the Drahk regime in Centaury Prime and answers many questions that the TV show left mildly unanswered. If yoU are a fan of Londo Molari this book will give you a clear understanding of Londo the emperor and how he chose to be remembered. Great job by David Peters. I really enjoyed reading it and in a very strange way brought me clousure to the end of Londo Molari's life. Good reading and hopefully this will be made into a two hour movie (but I really doubt it)
4,The holes have finally been filled.,"The space between Sleeping in light and the end of S5 was always wrought with black spaces. This book fills nearly all of them. No more need to ask why is that, what caused that, who is she and so on. The book reads just like an episode that JMS wrote. All it needs is the openning music and an openning monologue.There were a few points that I did not like, but on the whole they were not many.The book, and the whole series, portrais Londo so much like Mr. Jurasak did that I could hear the accent he put on when I read what Londo said. Most of the characters were played simulary, though Londo stands out."
4,Enjoyable,"book, and a great ending to the Centauri trilogy. The plot lines here are true to those in the B5 TV shows. The characterizations are very true, especially those of Londo and G'kar. I can't quite warm up to Vir being the hero, but that's merely because I am viewing him as the bumbling fool that he was 15 years ago.I'm not much of a sci-fi book fan, but I loved this series, as well as the Psi Corps series.Warning: these books aren't for anyone who has not followed the B5 TV show. Some books are isolated incidents that you could follow without knowing the backstory, but these definitely are not."
4,Some Closure,"This is the third novel of a triology that has been less that exceptional. The third novel wasn't written with the same care or spark as the first two. It seemed that the novel wanted to bring a closure to the ""story"" as soon as possible, and did it in such a manner that was rushed, and seemed unplanned. i did appreciate the fact that there was only so much room for the novel to complete itself, however it didnt seem to draw the same aury around it as some of the previous in this series. It is a good leisure read. Its a quick 2 hr read for some afternoon"
5,"Twists, turns, and all sorts of good stuff!","This book is everything I have come to expect from Babylon 5. The plot twists, turns, resolutions, and the intrigue are what make the show great, and Peter David picks this up nicely. He knows the main players well, and I could hear their voices as I was reading the book. This book makes for an excellent ending to a great trilogy!"
4,An Absolute Must for Bab5 fans,"Finishes the Centauri trilogy, wraps up many dangling threads from the series; strong in characterization."
4,Inspiration from within,"In Prescriptions For Living, Bernie Siegel opens up a new view for any open minded person to explore. It gives new insight into a world of love and understanding in order to help oneself and others. This book is for all to read because everyone can use improvement on relationships with loved ones, work-related stress, or just to accept the fact that love and time can heal all. With his own personal experience and anecdotes to share, this book is a very enjoyable and beneficial read."
4,Great storytelling!,I think this was a good book. I like mythological animals and stories and this is one of them. Gillian Bradshaw has a good imagination and is a good writer because I could see the things she described in my head. I want to read more of her books.
3,Appears to Work - Quite thick and not easy to spread,"Shipped in very short time and appearst to work though will not know for some time if ""anti-seize"" feature does what is required. Material is a bith thick and a little difficult to spread on threads of screw or spark plug (initial application)."
5,"Hey, it's a Swiss Army Knife with a thumb drive!","How could you go wrong? Typical high quality Victorinox with a 1 gig thumb drive, white LED light and removable (and replaceable) extracting ink pen (needs a bit of coaxing to get the initial ink flow, then works fine). Great for the home and office, but not for camping/serious outdoors unless you take the thumb drive off, as it obviously will not tolerate a wet/dirty environments. May require a little extra care not to knock it around when plugged in as the extra length may break the key or USB port. Got it for $45 shipped thru Amazon, (10 dollars off $50+ Victorinox promotion) you won't find a better price unless you steal one."
3,Victorinox 1 GB Sapphire Swiss Memory,"Along with the 1GB memory it has alot of nice gadgets, however the pin does not write. I guess the ink dried out on the shelf."
5,Great Product,"Had this at least a couple months now. Very useful, I probably use the knife more than anything, but it's super nice to have the light and USB stick at hand."
4,"Quilts, Quilts, Quilts","Initially very excited about this book, looked very interesting but on further reading discovered that some of the instructions for making the samplers weren't easy to follow, even with the help of a more experienced quilter, not really for a novice."
1,The Bethlehem Stumper,"The pattern for the Bethlehem star quilt is wrong. After following the steps word for word, and closely by the picture, we ended up with a bunch of strips that didnt go together to form a quilt, but rather a mess that we had to take apart and put back together to form the picture that they wanted it to look like.Wishful thinking on their part to insinuate that their wrong directions would help us achieve an accurate quilt."
5,Loads of Helpful Information,"I am a beginning quilter and need all the helpful information I can get. This book has it all. Lots of diagrams and colored pictures, ideas, and tips. A great book for any level of expertise."
5,Quilts,A great book to get you started in quilting. Easy to understand and helpful pictures. A variety of patterns and color suggestions.
2,"Not a ""Complete"" Guide to Quiting, as the title indicates","I am a beginning quilter and thought that a book with ""Complete Guide to Quiltmaking"" is its title would be just that, but it isn't. There is not one illustration of a person demonstrating a quilting technique. Oh, there are diagrams of patterns and pictures of quilts, but they were not sufficient for me to understand. For instance, the bias binding technique is limited to one sentence, whereas in Marsha McCloskey's Quick Classic Quilts, a whole page (with 5 pictures!) is dedicated to the technique. Guess which one I use? My other quilting reference book is the Singer Quilting Bible. The book, Quilts! Quilts!! Quilts!!!, sits gathering dust."
3,Not for Beginners,"As a beginning quilter I thought this book might be helpful, but the instructions aren't really that clear. Maybe I'll use it more after I become more experienced!"
5,My first quilting book. It's great!,"This was the quilting book I used for my first quilt. With this book, and the guidance of a good teacher, my addiction to quilting truly began. I have now been quilting for MANY years and still appreciate this book. I would definitely recommend this book to those of you wanting a great starting book."
1,Instructor's Guide!,"Buyer beware. I made the mistake of buying the instructors guide for Quilts Quilts Quilts. I thought I was purchasing the book itself, but ended up buying the guide. I am leaving this feedback to warn others."
4,Good buy,"This is a pretty cool ring; the design scrapes easily if you're rough with it, but it's not a big deal. I like the design as well.The only improvement I would make would be to slim it down a bit; it's a tad wide for my taste."
5,Best Jazz Strings Ever,"These are the best jazz strings I have ever purchased. They are indeed significantly more $ than others, but they last several times longer than other strings. Flatwound gives less string noise from your fingers, and also collects less dirt and oil, making them last longer. They sound amazing; last longer than any strings I've ever bought. If anyone who gave them a mediocre review can name a better string, please mention them and I'll check them out."
3,Too Expensive,These are good strings and have a nice sound. I just don't think they are worth the premium price.
5,Corporate wisdom,"Trying to match the brevity of Corporate canaries, I will simply say that it distills lessons in corporate wisdom that could easily be overseen as 'too simple' or even simplistic. They're not. I found it an amazingly honest tales of what a veteran who has seen it all in corporate warfare would share with new recruits to help them survive on the battlefield. Here you'll find good and simple advice. Simple doesn't mean trivial: I've seldom read books that deal honestly with the fate of corporations having to deal with the death of their market (it does happen a lot though!), or that tell you the simple truth about leveraging: borrowing money for growth is not necessarily a loosing gamble, it just happens to have very high negative odds and requires nerves of steel. Don't try it if you don't feel lucky..."
5,In This World,"This film is sensitive, moving and hard hitting.I loved it. I cried for the plight of asylum seekers and I am amazed at their endurance and hope. We should welcome such resourceful, hardy people with open arms."
3,Okay.,"I feel that the words ""gripping documentary film"" is inacurate for two reasons. I would not quite call it a documentary, as it is all reinactment, and, secondly, I think ""gripping"" is a stretch. I always welcome a chance to be reminded of the realities of life for those in less priveledged societies, but I felt that was really the most that this movie offered."
4,He should have had greater success,Ben Hewitt had a decent voice and was a good performer. He had talent as a song writer. I was surprised that the local radio stations in Niagara Falls & Buffalo did not play his music very much.
3,quality,"I have used wiss shears for 20 years or so for cutting fiberglass cloth for surfboards, they have held up well and I still use these shears today! They have been sharpened numerous times and still work well! I was a little disappointed in the finish quality of the new pair I got, I also got a pair of Mundial to compare and they were finished much better with a better edge!"
3,Are products made to the same quality as they were years ago?,"This is the 3rd pair of Wiss 20 shears that I have had in my sewing career. The grinding on the blades is not as I have had in the past. When I cut fabric with new shears, I should not hear each fibre cut individually. There should be no sound. It should be like cutting hot butter with a knife. I am a little disappointed with the new shears."
5,Use the best tool for the job--this is the best tool.,"There are lots of books on writing, but Scott Crider wrote a book aimed to help college students understand why they write (to learn, explore, and persuade) and how they should write.He follows Aristotle's definition of rhetoric as ""the faculty of discovering the possible means of persuasion ..."" (5), and then suggests how to ""discover"" arguments, how to organize a paper (he advocates replacing the ""5-paragraph-essay"" with the six-part (not paragraph) ""Classical Oration""), how to use language to say what you mean (""Style""), and how to evaluate and rework (and rework and ...) what you have written, returning at the end to his opening point that ""rhetoric moves an audience"" and good rhetoric moves an audience--as it has already moved the rhetor--toward that which is true.This is a gem of a book, not a word, sentence, or paragraph out of place, and every facet cut to lighten the student's way."
1,Useless,"For anyone who has taught writing seriously as a process of human responsiveness to reality, this book will seem simply silly. It is a throwback to a rigid conception of reality as having only one meaning, only one mode of expression (and if your mode does not conform to mine, beware). Not only is the style of writing pretentious in the extreme, the student example which is cited throughout the book contains a huge, really huge, compositional mistake, which makes me wonder just how much classical rhetoric depends on a priori bias. The book is impossible to teach because it assumes that students already have in mind the basics of writing as process, an odd assumption since neither ISI nor the school from which this author comes values anything as modern as process. It sounds too much like progress. One thing is clear: no progress in writing will be achieved by using this book."
5,Just do your research,I think every person that has a dog or cat should read this book. People really need to be educated on what they are putting into their animal companions. Vaccinations aren't bad but we do over vaccinated and also give too many vaccinations at the same time. The book has a lot of good facts that most people do not know and also information for further reading. Its you who has to take care of your animal companions welfare. Yes majority of vets love animals otherwise they would not be in the business. The key word is business they get more money when an animal is vaccination frequently. Vaccinations should be kept to a minimum and if a animal is getting more then one vaccination it should only be 2 at one time and then wait awhile for the others (least 6 weeks) There are many people who have started to go vaccination free and their dogs are perfectly fine and healthy. The book also shows that there is no evidence that frequent/yearly vaccination keeps an animal healthy.
3,"what is ""molecular lens cleaner"" anyway","The bottle does not identify what this stuff is, saying only ""biodegradable sterile aqueous solution,"" which I think may mean salt water in this case. I was wary of testing it on any high quality lens or filter, so I ran some tests on a few sky filters that I don't use much anymore.The purosol, together with its matching wiping rag, did remove fingerprints pretty well, but left lint behind. I then used a Pec*Pad with Eclipse lens cleaner on the same filter, and the latter combination worked better.I may finish the bottle of Purosol but I don't expect to buy more."
1,garbage,"The solution is not effective in cleaning eyeglass lenses. It streaks and we should not have to buff. Also, the pump completely snapped off the bottle and most of the cleaning solution spilled. I will be requesting a refund."
2,oily film,"Boy am I glad I tried this on my glasses before putting it on real glass. Leaves an oily film which causes all manner of color refraction effects. Two stars because it's sort of useful for eyeglasses, after it is subsequently washed off."
2,Works fine but 4 times the price of other cleaners,I've got a bottle of the Purosol (2 oz) in front of me and a bottle of the Zeiss Lens Cleaner (3 oz). The Purosol was four times the price for 2/3 the quantity. I cleaned one my right lens with the Zeiss and the left with the Purosol. I can't tell the difference. Too expensive. End of story.
1,Don't waste your money,Leaves oily streaks that will not resolve with the cleaner itself. Cheap Walmart cleaner is 10 times better than this.
3,Okay,"I got this based on the strong recommendations. Maybe it'd be better for camera lenses, but it doesn't seem to work that well on my glasses. It seems to not have enough solvency--too watery. Using a lens cleaning cloth with it seems to require a lot of effort to fully clear the lenses. But I think it's probably better than water."
2,Leaves film.,"This is my first review. I read a lot of negative reviews and a lot of positive. More positive than negative, and I decided to take a chance.I tried it with my eye glasses, (not a camera lens). My experience was very disappointing. I agree with everyone who said that it leaves a film. I used a brand new micro fiber cloth with the spray. It took a lot of spraying and wiping but always left a film. I tried just using the cloth alone and it worked better but still left a film and one or two smears. I decided to try using the cloth first and then the spray, and finish up with the cloth. It still did not work. Nothing I tried worked and I tried a lot. This product just does not work for me. I definitely will not recommend it."
2,Lens Cleaner,This product is not what I expected. Some reviews stated it worked well on glasses and others wrote it left a smear-like residue behind. I have to agree that this product does leave streaks behind. I really wanted this to work on my glasses but it just makes it messier. Delivery was prompt by seller - Thank you very much!
4,great cleaner,"Purosol has made a solid name for itself in the high tech cleaning world by putting out quality cleaners which are also environmentally sound. This one is no exception.I used this cleaner to clean the lens, filter, and mirror in an SLR, and a few other items. It worked well, leaving no residue, strong odors, streaks, etc. The microfiber cleaning cloth included, while not ""lint free,"" was nonetheless soft and non-abrasive, and worked well on the optics.I've used Puosol products for years and I find no drawbacks or problems with this or any other Purosol product I've used, and recommend them without hesitation."
1,did not work well for me,"I use Purosol on my eyeglasses. Purosol just smears fingerprints/oil around on the lense. Definitely does not work as well as the isopropyl alcohol wipes I also use. There are no ingredients on the Purosol bottle, so it may just be water, I don't know. It works about as well as just water in that it does not remove the oil that gets on your glasses from you face or fingers. I use it with lens paper that comes with the isopropyl alcohol wipes after the alcohol has dried off, so I know the paper is not problem I tried using Purosol with a new lens cloth too, and that was equally ineffective."
4,Good,"It's good, but it smears a bit more than other products I've used. I recently switched to anti-glare glasses, and my eye doctor recommended this brand. Hasn't caused any problems yet, bottle is a bit big - get a smaller sprayer for carrying with you, I found a two pack of 1 oz sprayers for $1 at target that are about the width of a large pencil."
5,Who are all these people?,"That was what I thought when I saw the concert's program (in Santiago de Compostela, 2007, they are also very good live performers). I had never before heard of Jeffrey Skidmore, Ex Cathedra... and the repertoire, excepting three pieces, was also new to me. But the concert was a marvellous discovery.What may have happened all this time? Why have we ignored these musical treasures? They were ""buried"" in cathedrals' archives, and access to them was very restricted. A group of enthusiastic musicologists and musicians, like Jeffrey Skidmore, are bringing them to life again. God bless you all!"
5,* * * * * * 6 stars out of a possible 5,"This record was my first taste of the Renaissance and Baroque music from Latin America. The dates of the pieces range from roughly 1500 to 1750.The range of styles is quite broad - from pieces that sound very close to the masterpieces from Europe during those time periods, to pieces that have a very strong influence of native music.The pieces with a relatively 'traditional' sound include, e.g., the Masses by Padilla and Zipoli.In my feelings, the one thing that characterizes this music is a sense of the spirit dancing.Note as an obvious example tr. 6: Araujo's ""Los Coflades de la Estleya"" - but that sense of ecstatic dancing also comes through in the other pieces.The performances by Ex Cathedra are close to perfection.I also highly recommend Ex Cathedra's companion album ""Moon, Sun & All Things""."
1,damaged during delivery,I received this item with box all riped up. It has poor packaging so the item is not 100% protected. The corners all damaged. I bought this item for Christmas so I can not return it because it will be too late to get a new item back in time. I wish they would have put better packaging since the delivery people don't care about how to handle items. Otherwisw the table is ok.
3,Easy to assemble and use,The table arrived very quickly. Sooner than I expected with the free shipping. It was easy to assemble although the table top arrived slighly damaged. It was cracked in one corner. It seems sturdy and should withstand the abuse of a 4 year old. I am happy with the table. I think it is a great value considering the price I paid.
4,wooden train table,"I took a risk when buying this table because all the reviews said that the table was shipped poorly. Well, they were right. The box came opened and broke in a few spots. I was very lucky that I had all the pieces though. The screws in the box were not wrapped (just floating around), but I ended up with them all. The directions were torn in half and not very good. After getting the table together, I was pleasantly surprised that it is a pretty solid table. So if you like taking risks, this is one for you!"
2,You get what you pay for!!,"I read all the negative reviews on this table and decided to go ahead and order hoping I would get lucky and not have all the problems the other customers had. DON'T DO IT! The table arrived poorly packaged and beat up just as the others here have described. One corner of the table top was bashed in, another piece of wood was split, the green paint from the table top rubbed off onto the white table leg, and edge of the other table leg was dented in revealing the plywood underneath the paint. This is a very CHEAP table - cheaply constructed of plywood. It is functional, but just not very attractive since it arrives already damaged. Just beware before you buy that you will more than likely be getting a banged up train table."
1,Beware before you purchase,"Received item in terrible packing, slight damage, missing all screws. Hard to put together a table with no screws! Amazon customer service was nice enough, but still no screws. Sending back is going to cost as much as the table. In addition, manufacturer contact information is nonexistant. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Great table and inexpensive!,"I purchased this while it was on sale so we got a great deal, especially compared to other similar tables. It was pretty simple to put together as well which is a plus. The table is a nice size and is perfect for my kids to play on!"
4,great bargain table,"Great table for the price....bought it for Christmas 2010 for 44.99 and that included shipping, so if it is more than that just wait it should go down in price. Was pretty much like putting a piece of ikea furniture together, no directions just one picture. However it is very common sense to put it together and it is quite heavy too. Careful cause the paint does cheap quite easily."
5,Well worth the price...,"I had my brother purchase this for my daughters. After reading the reviews, I was a little apprehensive... but hopeful. However, the packaging came perfect, easy to assemble and looks FAR MORE EXPENSIVE than the price we paid. I am very pleased with this purchase. (And besides, it's also durable... today my 32lb children, two of them, were playing on top of the table). Great buy."
4,Great Value,Have had this table for about a year now and is just like new. Is holding up great. The box it came in when shipped was a little scary though. very suprised all the pieces were still in the box.
2,Great table...packaging is HORRIBLE,"Okay this table is perfect for my daughters Little People, but the packaging that it came in was horrible. When I received this item on my door step, there was a hole at the bottom of the package and it was missing 9 screws. So I had to go to Home Depot and find some similar just so that I could put it together. After all that hassle was said and done, this table is good...my daughter LOVES it."
1,Cheap Table,"After reading the reviews on this table we thought we would gamble. We were very disappointed. The packaging arrived torn and open in several places. Only a few screws came with the table, not that this made much difference as there were table parts missing too. The parts that did arrive were chipped practically in every corner and the paint rubbed off. Amazon were efficient in having the item picked up for return and refund."
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"The packaging for this product is unacceptable. The first table I received was completely beat up/busted on every corner. I sent it back only to recieve a second one in the same condition...poorly packaged and damaged beyond use. I didn't even have to take it out the box...the damage was visible through the broken packaging everywhere. The price with free shipping is the catch, but it is a game to see what you'll get. I guess this is why they are $49.99. You're lucky if you get one you can use. I was not lucky."
4,Can't beat the price!,"This train table is a nice size, bigger than I expected. It went together easily and is sturdy enough for my grandson's Thomas stuff. It seems to be made as well as what I saw at Toys R Us for double the price."
2,Glad I didn't open this in front of my son...,"because I had to return it. The packaging was flimsy - the box arrived really chewed up, and the table and legs weren't packed well at all. The top had two huge gouges in it, and the legs were beat up. It was also missing five screws, and the ones that did make it through transit had just been tossed into the box. Had it been packed better (and arrived without damage) I would have kept it."
5,Two man wrecking crew of street blues!,"Satan and Adam produce more incredible blues from two people then the average ten piece band! Satan on vocals, guitar and percussion and his sidekick Adam on harmonica, weave a sophisticated web of raw blues that at times puts the hair on the back of your neck on end. They met and began playing together on the streets of Harlem, and the soul of their music continues to find itself somewhere east of 125th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. This band captured the attention of U2, who included them on their Rattle & Hum Live CD."
5,great stuff!,"I am a lifelong blues fan, dating back to listening to WNJR out of Newark under the covers at night as a little kid on a farm in North Jersey in the '50s. These guys are great, and play off each other perfectly. Five stars!"
4,Maybe the last of the great albums,If I'm not mistaken this was the last album of Randy's produced by Larry Norman. I enjoyed the songs and the purity of this album very much.
4,The Way of the Fathers,"If you can't find just the right way to begin your daily prayer, look to the early Fathers. In this book there are short sayings on many subjects that will get you started and introduce you to the early church Fathers."
3,"Not Perfect, But It Works for Me","Although the product info states that the temperature range is 54-66 degrees, a thermometer confirms that it gets no colder than 60 degrees. (Numerous other online reviews report the same thing.) In fact, the digital temperature control on the front may well be just for show since no matter where I set it, the interior temperature stays a constant 60 degrees. Who knows, maybe it's not even connected to anything. While this might seem like a fatal flaw, and I did consider returning my unit, in the end I decided to keep it because: I only buy red wines and only store them for a month or two while I'm waiting to drink them. 60 degrees is cool enough to keep them fresh for a few months, and just about right for serving. Besides that, the unit is attractive, small, quiet, and the price is right. So, bottom line, if you only drink reds and aren't aging Petrus for your grandchildren, it might work fine."
4,The case for capitalism by one of the brightest economists of modern times,"I picked up this book as a beginning of an attempt to self-educate myself on the topic of economics. Maybe it is not the best place to start for a novice, but I did thoroughly enjoy the book. Dr. Friedman makes a compelling case for capitalism, which has been under so much assault by academia, popular culture and the media. Friedman explains why capitalism works, as opposed to government intervention in the economy, in a compelling and concise book. At times, some of the concepts went over my head, but for the most part this was attainable for the beginner. I strongly recommend this book and intend to take a shot at more of Friedman's books."
2,Capitalism and Murder: dry reading along the way,"This master of the neoliberal cause offers nothing new in this book, in truth a compilation of a bunch of lectures given by the author back in the sixties!!!IF Friedman is naive enough to think that private enterprise is the answer to all of us, he must be crazy. If he thinks that the big corporations are interested in prosperity for anyone eles beside themselves, you're living in a dream world. Well, the recent lack of energy in New York and CHicago is a good example...THis book is bul...it...Only that."
5,Capitalism and Freedom: A Free Market Perspective,"Milton Friedman, the most influential economist of the 20th century, writing on the economic fundamentals of a free market economy in his book, ""Capitalism and Freedom"", demonstrates that government should be limited. Not only were his ideas relevant for his day, but they are remarkably relevant in today's deficit spending/ever growing government take over of the American free enterprise system. Milton Friedman shows you why a free market capitalist approach leads to the optimal balance between government involvement in the private sector and our individual liberties."
5,Echoes of Gandhi,"Gandhi, ""No society can possibly be built on a denial of individual freedom.""Gandhi, ""... an increase in the power of the State ... does the greatest harm to mankind by destroying individuality which lies at the heart of all progress..."""
3,Free to Choose is a better read.,"While I believe Milton Friedman was an intelligent person with some views that are highly intellectually stimulating even when I disagree with them, this is definitely not his best work. Capitalism and Freedom is unnecessarily brief and therefore, the arguments Friedman makes come off as overly simplistic and lacking any real depth. If you're looking for a better read by Milton Friedman, read Free to Choose. The arguments in Free to Choose are much more detailed and therefore, more convincing."
1,Nothing but lies to justify self intrest,This is nothing but lies by a man who understands nothing about economic inequility and favors the oppresion that is pure capitalism
2,Boring and boring...Now I understand...,"Now I understand how this illustrious liberal writer must have won so many people to his cause. The book is so boring, so repetitive, with such a bad writing, that maybe people agree with him fast, just for the sake of having his mouth shut up!I see some points he tries to make, but mos of them are silly and naive. Maybe he would not have written this kind of thing had he wrote in our century..."
1,Rightwing hack spouts economic drivel,"The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the ""initiative"" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, ""Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did.""If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet."
5,Amazingly Prophetic,"Although this text is over forty years old, the principals are just as true today. Milton Friendman seems amazingly prophetic, and that is one of the most entertaining qualities of this book - to look at the text now and see how most of the examples of government intervention have developed just as he theorized. Not only has the result of government intervention turned out much as he proposed, but the reaction of government has followed his predictions almost exactly. This book will be an eye opening jump start for anyone who believes FDR's policies were beneficial, that the federal reserve has done it's job, or even that professional licensure by the state is a beneficial protection of consumers."
5,Read it and we'll talk,"Good for starters and initiated alike. Whether you're looking for enlightment or to see your own thoughts in paper, shared and amplified by a nobel laureate, you need to read this. Superb simplicity and depth. FB"
5,great read,"this is my first book of his to read...his writing isn't easy reading, but it is worth sorting through all the language to get to his point."
5,Great libertarian manifesto,This is a great book exposing how freedom is promoted by the free market. Outlines steps that can be taken to make the U.S. more free. However this book assumes basic micro/macro knowledge.Every educated American should read this book
5,...... common sense applied .....,"very easy to read and understand , clear, structured and: very telling !"
3,A little extreme for my likings...,but he was well regarded by the wonderful folks at the Ivy League schools. I would have given 4 stars but he spent his latter years on the webite of that unpatriotic lunatic Michael W Hodges.Verdict: a little too hippie
3,"considering current events, he left something out!!!!",the title above says it all.something missing in his considerations.perhaps should include a chapter on human character and the greed that appears to run rampant in the higher levels of the economic ladder.
2,a caution about Milton Friedman,"As an economist, I'd like to offer a caution about Mr. Friedman, if I may. Mr. Friedman is one of the greatest economists, and certainly the pre-eminent living one. However, Mr. Friedman does have an agenda, and the economic theories he advocates most strongly are not houses built upon rock. In particular, they do not consistently agree with Keynesian theory. Keynes wasn't always right, but he did have an astonishing amount of predictive ability. The test of time weighs strongly in favor of Keynes and against Friedman. By all means read what he has to say, but please remember that his theories describe a special economic situation that is rather rare. Thanks."
3,"Dr. Friedman, Up Close","This a very good place to start to understand Friedman's economic theories and ideas. Some parts drift a bit too much from his main arguments, but I blame that on editors rather than the author."
4,The Hidden Conundrum,"This book well deserves to be a classic, but it does not present any of the problems with Capitalism, so don't expect a balanced view. Via capitalism, we are like a bacterial colony on a dead squirrel. Bacteria metabolize all of the useful nutrients, and then there is a mass die-off. This works for the bacterial genetics because some of the bacteria will be blown or otherwise transported to another dead squirrel or such, and the cycle will continue. We, on the other hand, only have one ""dead squirrel"" (planet Earth), and no alternative ecosystems are within reach. So capitalism is betting all of our marbles that science will save our collective butts. For the science of rational selection that is economics, the end-game dependency on hope shows its non-rational weakness."
5,The best tasting WPI out there...,"It doesn't get any better than this. No fat, no sugar, just pure protein than blends superbly. I get a wonderful tasting vanilla smoothie just from 8oz of almond milk, 4 ice cubes, a tablespoon extra of splenda (I have a sweet tooth), and one scoop of Bioplex Vanilla Pure WPI. Awesome way to start the day if you are dieting, or an active person."
1,bad smell,terrible smell! made me sick to my stomach when i drank it.i will not buy again.i wanted to like this but it was terrible in everyway
5,Excellent Choice,"The ""Natural"" WPI is a great choice. Mixes well with liquids and I add my own flavor. By itself it really has no taste, which is excellent. I just mix it with vanilla rice milk and gulp it down. I was also impressed with the scoop size. Small scoop, but it packs in 20 grams of protein per scoop. That's more that enough for me. Good stuff! (and I've tried many others)"
5,high quality protein,"I started buying bioplex nutrition pure WPI back in my body building days. I have been vegetarian for over 20 years and had nearly become vegan. I needed the extra protein for the weight training. I went through a variety of popular brands before a professional body builder recommended this one to me. This is a wonderful, high quality protein. It has never made me sick to my stomach or gassy. I have a scoop every day in my morning smoothie."
5,best whey,"This is the best whey protein supplement. It is all natural, nothing added, tastes good. I add it right to my cereal or whatever. Also best price I can find."
2,Too small,"Bought the bag for a great price. It is a good bag with lots of room for all sorts of stuff.... but it was to small for my laptop. It only holds a 15"" ... not a 15.4"" like some sites say. Make sure your laptop is compatible with it."
2,Dense,"Tanith Lee's writing seems to come in two categories, though not exclusively. Her Flat Earth series, and her fairy tale stories, are written in an arch style which suits them.And then there are books like this one, and the comparable Paradys series, which speed past arch and enter baroque. I found the writing so distracting that I had difficulty following the plot.Some readers might enjoy this style, but I don't. The book is short, which is nice, but it's still too long to sustain the style. On a positive note, the period setting and the mix of murder and alchemy are intriguing. If only I know where it was going and what it meant when it got there."
5,HIghly informative - Useful!,"My avocation is making herbal medicines and cosmetics. This is one of the few reference books I cannot live without - ragged from constant consultation. The descriptions of the essential oils are thorough and quite useful, without being overly technical. The chart in the back of ailments and the oils that can be used to treat them is particularly helpful. The psychological profiles of the oils are also interesting, but not overstated. This book would be suitable for people new to essential oils and their properties as well as an appropriate tool for those who are more knowledgeable."
1,Not high quality,"This is not a very high quality piece of machinery. Will it shave/trim your hair? Yes of course, but it is not very precise and it is made of cheap parts. When you pick it up in your hand you will understand. Also after a short period of time it will require being plugged in all the time and during use to work. I rate it a ""don't buy."" Spend an extra 10 bucks and get something better and perhaps think about a different brand. That's what I am doing right now!"
3,Good but not Great,"Does the job, Good Price. I expected it to cut a little closer than it does though...not great for edging"
3,Wahl Trimmer,"The trimmer cuts well and is compact. However, it is much louder than the Norelco trimmer I previously used. Also, the snap-on/off trimmer accessories are a bit cumbersome. My old Norelco had a built-in adjustable head for trim length that was much more functional."
1,Worked great for a few months,"This product worked great for a few months then simply stopped. Tried the suggestions given to loosen the blades, etc. This product is junk."
4,Does the job,I really like this trimmer. It came with everything I needed and it was charged. I haven't even had to charge it yet. Love it.
4,"Light, functional beard trimmer","Excellent product for the money. The battery lasts a long time, the trimmer is exact, but there are really no directions about how to use this. It takes a little while to figure out how to use the slider on the main plastic trimmer cover guide to get different hair length heights. Other than that a great product. I even bought one for my son-in-law."
4,Great no snag shadows,This works great for that 5 o'clock shadow. I use it for that a couple of times a week for that and haven't recharged it yet so not worried about pluggin in the charger all the time. Cheap stand. Can't vouche for the other attachments or features. Wish it had the vacuum the Norelco has.
1,Disappointing,"When I received the trimmer & took it out of the box, the first thing I noticed were a lot of scratches in the paint. Secondly, it appeared to be missing the release tab to remove the guide. It was also difficult to adjust the pre-attached guide, as it seemed very sticky. The instruction pamphlet was poorly written and not helpful. This trimmer was inexpensive, and it showed. I never bothered trying to use it, since it didn't have the release tab as shown in the diagram. It was supposed to be new, but it seemed as if it was refurbished. I sent the item back immediately."
5,great,this replaces the same trimmer we bought 7 years ago. we've tried others but this particular wahl trimmer is the best.
3,Trimmer Review,"The rechargeable trimmer is okay. Its ""portability"" is the most favored feature. The negative is it does not cut my beard (a black man's beard) as close as I would like."
5,Great Value,"This Wahl beard trimmer provides an even and consistent trim with comfort and ease. The guards click on easily and stay securely in place, allowing for a worry-free trim. It comes with a stand that keeps the trimmer docked in an easy-to-reach position and also holds the charger in place.Several attachments come in a handy pouch for easy storage.When I hold the trimmer, it feels like quality. The motor runs quietly and smoothly. The head is compact to hit those hard-to-reach places with ease.If great price, quality and ease of use are what you seek, this is the finest quality trimmer available. It comes with my highest reccomendation."
1,Not helpful at all,"I couldn't even assemble the product, and there were no instructions on how to do so."
2,Disapointed,"I have to say i am disappointed, Having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916, which i felt gave me a good trim, i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon.the one i received was much cheaper in quality. The plastic guide IS cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually, which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped. The guide shattered. There is no replacement for the 5-position guide for the 9916 I can find.Now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom, or finding a razor that can survive real world use.On the plus side, the battery life on this razor is incredible."
1,Cheap and breaks easily. Poorly designed.,"Don't buy this product. I went through two units with the same problem. The trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade. Within less than one week the tabs broke and the trimmer would no longer stay attached. Further the base/stand is just a lightweight piece of junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories - very poorly designed, Wahl should be embararssed.It did a nice job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to install and remove, the base practically useless and the trimmer tabs break so easily that I would have given it no stars if possible.The fact that I returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth."
5,What you need,I already have owned this trimmer and have had it for years and it treated me well. Only reason I needed a new one was I lost the charger in a move and it was only a few dollars more to get the whole new set.
4,Beard Trimmer...,Pleased with this product. Needed a new one. Hope this one lasts as long as my previous one. Ten years!!!
1,The painful groomer,"If you enjoy pulled hair and very slow trimming, this is the trimmer for you. My old trimmer was fantastic. It lasted 20 years and only died because my wife washed it. I had to do multiple passes on sideburns and beard to get it even. Each pass is at a snails pace compared to my old trimmer. Worst of all, even when used slowly, it tends to grab and pull hair. I would not buy one again and I will find a replacement quickly."
2,Quality stinks.,"The on/off switch felt cheap from day 1, 3 months later & it's messed up, hope I can find the receipt!"
3,"Not the same build quality as the older model, but...","... it works about the same. Lighter, more ergonomic in the hand, but the build quality seems cheap compared to the 8 year-old Wahl Groomsman it replaced. I don't expect this one to last that long, but it's still a reasonable replacement and value."
2,Bought 2 - both Broke,"I LOVED the trimmer compared to an old Remington trimmer that I had. The charge holds forever on this thing, and the movement is extremely fast so it makes for a great beard and stubble trimmer. HOWEVER - I dropped it and the head internals broke since it was cheap plastic. I understand if you drop it, it can break.I went and bought another exact same model. I had it less than two weeks and an internal piece (part of the spring head assembly) broke for no reason. No dropping, no water, I babied it. It simply broke because of cheap build quality. Never buying another cheap Wahl."
3,"Good, cheap razr cover.",This is a basic phone cover for an excellent price. I'm glad I purchased it.
3,it's adequate,I didn't like the belt attachment on the back of the cover. It made it harder to keep my phone in the pocket. The leather cover is stiffer than i expected..the color is not shiny black. The product was sent on time and had a smooth transaction..Thanks!
3,I am halfway happy,"I say this because it did the job. It fit the phone perfectly. I bought this for my husband and I never heard a compliant about it. About a year into use the clip broke, considering I paid under 5 [...] for it I couldn't give it a low rating for that. You get what you pay for and personally a cell case I pay that little for, I was actually surprised it lasted that long. Overall appearance is nice too. I bought a leather cover from my cell phone company and actually liked my husbands better. Best feature, the inside isn't covered w/ plastic so it makes using the phone easier as the cover clips onto the outside of the phone only."
2,Just Okay,"Maybe this is my fault, but I thought I was buying the most recent edition of this book (I guess I should have known better for $.39!). I am now trying to use it in class (most times unsuccessfully) as the page numbers don't match up with the newer versions and there are specific strategies missing. Overall, I'm not sure who is at fault, but I do know I'm left feeling a bit annoyed."
4,"Incredible Photos! (oh yeah, and some music too...)","A ""luxurious"" package indeed. This book-style CD release is well worth the price for the photos alone... many pages of lovely full color portraits of B.B. from all phases of her career and in various stages of undress... The music is basically vintage French bubblegum pop/bossa/loungey stuff... there's even a duet with Serge Gainsbourg (no photos of him included). Her voice is actually quite pleasant, and all the songs are sung in sultry French, ""la langue d'amour""... do you really need another reason to buy this? Brigitte, Toujours Brigitte!"
2,Barbirolli--Heifetz,"The Barbirolli-Heifetz transfers were not very good. Much better on Naxos Historical discs. The Milstein Bruch concerto was enjoyable. It was the first recording of the Bruch that I ever heard, and is still my favorite (nostalgia?)."
5,Amazing pianist,"The Rachmaninoff and the Prokofiev Concertos have no equal. The pianist technique and interpretations are very interesting. The best of Weissenberg is here, I have not doubt about that. A great collection to be recommended."
2,"It works, but it stinks!","It does the work: the style stays all day long. However, it stinks so bad. It doesn't have the pleasant smell that you would expect from a baby product. It would have been better for it to be odorless."
2,Tooo Smelly for a baby...,"Let me just say that I LOVE LOVE this company's clean and clear hair gel. It's absolutely fantastic. Since I loved it so much, I decided to give this balm a try. Oh my god, it smells so horrible. It might be ok for an adult, but no one wants to smell this on a little sweet baby. I was so disappointed. As far as working, I suppose it keeps the hair in place, but it gives the look of ummm lard or something like it. I hate writing a bad review, but after the fantastic experience with the hair gel, I'm just hoping the company will read this and do something to bring this product up to the level of their gel."
2,lasting hold and lasting smell,"I absolutely hate overbearing fragrances for infants, so Original Little Sprouts products seemed perfect b/c they were not over-bearing. The other (OLT) products have a wonderful light smell or no fragrance at all. This product worked well on my infant son's hair, but the smell is quite distinct and unpleasant. I hope that the marketing division of the company is suggesting a change in this case. It is best described as a smell of wet or mildewed cardboard. It is totally un-baby-like. What were they thinking?"
2,A Woman's Decision,I did not particularly care for this book - too broad and not easy to read - too general.
1,Wrong cd,This was supposed to be Rocketface but it's not. I ordered this twice from Amazon and ended up getting a cd called 'Lovemethod' Seems these 2 cd's share the same UPC code. Just a head's up if your buying off of Amazon.
3,Tonya's Opinion,I was unable to load the entire program. I was not expecting the floppys and either the floppys are bad or my floppy drive is. I'll get it figured out eventually.
4,pleasantly surprised,"I was reluctant to purchase this item because of the negative reviews regarding missing parts and installation problems. My wife wanted this product so we ordered it. It arrived 95% assembled and the remaining 5% took less than five minutes. We were missing one standard size washer to complete the job. The scooter is well constructed, the instructions are not for surgeons but with a little reflection make sense and get you to the end quickly. I suspect the missing washer was somewhere in the shipping box. Unless my shipment had received special treatment you should have no assembly problems. Good price, fast delivery and is what it says it is. Unfortunately for me our next purchase decisions will be ruled by my wife's belief her intuitive sense was correct and my reluctance and research was unnecessary and unfounded."
1,Uncomfortable and Poorly Constructed,"I knew I was in trouble as soon as the package arrived: torn, stained box, missing hardware, strong mothball odor, and evidence that the item had been purchased and returned by someone else. Still, using some extra hardware I have in the garage, I put it together.Although I am nowhere near the 400-pound capacity limit, the seat rocks side-to-side. It is supported only by a central metal post. It feels as though it is only a matter of time before it snaps off altogether. The seat also has a raised portion in front. This is not only unnecessary, it makes sitting difficult because you always have to make sure you don't sit askew or you may hurt yourself (this is not a problem with the bench-style carts). Men, more than women, would be uncomfortable on this seat.The pneumatic wheels will require ongoing maintenance to keep them properly inflated.Not worth the price."
2,not what I expected,Too tall. Hard to assemble. Parts missing. Package arrived already demolished (that may explain the missing parts?) Seat is kind of wobbly. The only thing I like about this scooter is that it can be easily moved from one location to another. Would NOT buy it again nor would I recommend it.
1,Garden Seat,"I ordered this item for a replacement portable gardening seat for my wife. The description of this item, a Garden Scoot, indicates that it is intended for use as a portable seat in the garden. After receiving the Scoot I realized that the seat, in the lowest position, is much to high for use in our garden beds at the ground level. The seat is very much too high to use as a seat for bending over to work plants and pull weeds at the ground level, feels like standing on your head.Although the product is well made and looks to be very strong but it is DEFINATLY NOT A COMFORTABLE SITTING HEIGHT TO WORK PLANTS AND PULL WEEDS AT GROUND LEVEL.

However the return cost a restocking fee of 15% and return shipment costs:Restocking 15% $17.50Return Shipping $29.00Total Costs for Returning $66.50 (The original price of the Scoot was $114.00)"
5,Timeless Swiss Watch,"For the money this is a great swiss watch, superb quality, sapphire crystal, swiss mov't etc.,perfect size for my small 6"" wrist.I have a similar Cartier watch but I like the Concord better, it is not very flashy and I feel more comfortable wearing this watch. If you are looking for a classic tank watch this worth a shot."
5,Good primer for online surveys!,I've been doing online surveys and consulting for years and have been using Vista surveys as I found them to be the best overall. This book really helps to enusure that I ask the right questions for my Fortune 500 clients! By reading this book you will certainly pick up on not only critical questions you should be asking but HOW to ask them. Highly recommend!
3,Solid guidelines for Survey,This was a good book for amateurs or those who have not been formally trained on the art of survey's. Covers all the rules and checkpoints for creating and conducting a survey.
3,3 1/2 Stars! ~ True love wins!,"The Nine-Month Bride by Judy ChristenberrySilhouette Romance #1324 ~ October 1998~ Fabulous Fathers Collection ~ December 2009Our hero, Lucas is in over his head with reluctant bride Susannah. He wants a son. She wants a baby. Neither want to fall in love. Their chemistry bodes well for a marriage, but both worry about losing their hearts. And of course they do! This is a charming fun read, with our hero putting his foot in his mouth a few times, and our heroine determined to hide her true feelings. True love wins!"
4,A Soldiers Perspective,I read this book when it was first published and the memories of many of the participants were fresh in my mind. I was struck by his knowledge of so many players in this great tragedy and appreciated his acknowledgement of their many contributions.This is a book that all students of the Viet Nam war should read and understand what we did. Mr. Snepp did and he tells this story very well. I should know I left Viet Nam in July 1972.
4,Student User-Friendly,"This book is concise, factual and a good reference. It has been very helpful in different areas of my work experience. I would recommend this text for anyone who needs such information in increasing their knowledge of forms design"
3,Graphic Design for 21st Century Desktop Publishers,Book should show more step by step examples in the book on how things can be done in WORD. Too much text.
2,Not for the 21st century,"I found the graphics in this book to be poorly chosen and of poor quality, which was surprising, given the book's title and topic. The layout was less than gripping, again surprising, given the book's title and topic. Given these two critical flaws,one would be hesitant to follow the authors' advice for graphics and layout! Roger C. Parker's Desktop Publishing for Dummies and Ann Goodheart's Alleviating Prepress Anxiety cover more territory, better, more amusingly, more swiftly -- and they cost much less."
5,Great Reference Book,"I purchased this book for a college class, and upon completion of the class decided to keep it to add to my personal library. The book is not only designed very well, but contains valuable information on everything from business stationary to forms design. The books step by step approach will prove helpful for any beginner to advanced graphic designer."
5,I keep this book on my desk,"I'm new at desktop publishing and am expected to compose a variety of documents including forms, business reports and sales literature. I took a Pagemaker course but have had no training in graphic design.This book, Graphic Design for the 21st Century Desktop Publishers is a big help, especially when I need to come up with an idea for a layout. I keep the book on my desk."
3,"Good book, but I don't think anyone proofreads.","This book has a load of information on refrigeration and heating, but somebody needs to proofread before publishing. The authors definitely know their stuff, but it is the way some things are written that makes some stuff hard to understand. Some textbooks, not many, but some, are written so well that a person could almost teach themselves, but this is not one of those books.For example: they don't explain the details about how the compound gauge reads.They just say that it measures low pressure and vacuum. When I first took a refrigeration course, I was confused by their explanation and had to do research on the internet. I wanted to know the conversion between in Hg and microns. To me it seemed as though the gauge should have read from 30 inHg down to 0 inHg NOT down to 30."
3,Lab Manual for Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technology 6th edition,My son is happy with the workbook. Amazon delivered as promised. I will use them again.
1,BOOK EXCHANGE AND ORDER,"I am still trying to order and receive the correct book.The book I want delivered to the prison adddressHVAC BOOK NUMBERISBN# 1-4018-3765-4Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technology 5th edition prefer the 6th if available.WAITING FOR THE CREDITS TO SHOW UP ON MY ACCOUNT FOR THE RETURNED BOOKS, THAT WERE LAB MANUALS, NOT THE TEXT BOOK."
3,It's ok,the first pages have the answers written in it but it works great! Thanks for selling this item to me
2,refigeration and air conditioning study guide,"Next time I will just stick with the main book, I beleave the lab manual realy is for class room setting . The text book on the other hand is Great, and I have learned a lot form it and keep it close by with the rest of my home manuals... Jim"
3,No Cord!,"Although it says this is corded it has no cord, so we couldn't use it. Other than that it looked fine, though."
2,Not very much at all.,"Well, as others have said, there really isn't alot of tape. This is a tiny piece. I was looking around for around 25 foot of glow tape when I spotted this. I think my eyes saw what I wanted them to see and not what really was. I THOUGHT it said 2"" x 24' (feet), boy was I surprised when I unrolled it to see a 2 foot piece of tape. And for $13 and change with shipping, I must say I regret this purchase. Does glow bright though..."
2,Too dim,"This product is yet another in a long line of disappointments.It seems everyone wants to make a quick buck, and the way to do it is to make ambiguous claims about ""visible in dark for hours"" and ""high visibility"".There are phosphorescent products that do the job of being especially bright, but they are three times the cost of this product.I guess price will have to be my guide."
4,Used book,"Bought it used, was supposed to be in perfect condition, but had a little wear and tear here and there. Still in great condition and worth the rebate, shipping was also much fast than what was initially indicated."
3,Solid device with tons of features,This little router is packed with tons of features. My only issue is that the device does not support extra VLAN's and you cannot configure subinterfaces on the the 4 switchport LAN interfaces.Great SOHO router with more features than you can ever use but not a great LAB router due above reasons.I wouldn't suggest this device to users that do not know IOS.
3,"Easy to clean, little else to it","I love how easy this is to clean. It doesn't get spotless, but you can even invert it to really get at the corners. One of the worst parts of roasting vegetables for example is cleaning the tray afterward or going through sheets of disposable aluminum foil that can stick to the vegetables anyway, but this product is a great solution.As for the other purported benefits, it is not great for a lot of baking since many recipes rely on the base getting hot and sometimes it does not cook evenly. And while it stays cooler than a metal pan, it's still not cool to touch. Furthermore, because its so floppy, you simply MUST put a tray of sorts on the bottom in order to remove it from the oven easily, so don't get rid of any oven mitts just yet ;-)."
5,Castlevania's soundtrack are the best!!!!,"I simply love Castlevania and everything related with, but their music is just amazing. Is the perfect MIX between Modern and Classic Music!!!"
1,sound please,"I was very dissapointed because, I know it's an import, but the first CD wouldn't play possibly because it's set for a different region. If it wasn't such a hassle to return it to the seller I would, so mabey I will just sell it someone else. As much as I paid, I hoped it would play. Only the second disk plays and none of those songs are from the game. Plus, everything was written in japanese!!! DUDE, if someone has any advice for me such as how to get this thing to play or where to get a copy that WILL play write me very, very soon!!!"
4,It is good,"I bough two sets. The first set was wonderful, but the second set has some scratches at the back of the plate. The color is good."
5,great,I love this product from corelle really great buy for me and the plates is really durable you use for a longer time.
2,cups are of inferior quality,Except the cups all other items are really good. The cups quality is not the same tht of other stuff in the packet and is of inferior quality. Please dont buy unless you want to discard the tea cups. So far I have not given bad rating to any of the products bought from Amazon but this one deserves it.
2,Are these dishes plastic???,"I was so excited to receive these dishes having read all the rave reviews and seen the commercial with the model walking down the runway, slipping, dropping her Corelle dish that does not shatter as it slams to the floor... Well, I think it's safe to say that these dishes don't shatter because they are not made of breakable material. They seem to be some sort of plastic material. I wanted them as my every day dishes that I can use in the dishwasher & microwave since my current set is so old, but I have to say that they are so cheap looking, I will have to use my fancy dishes anytime company comes over because they look cheap, a little smaller than the average dish size, and appear to be plastic. Was disappointed with the purchase and would have rathered to spend a little more money and get dishes with a little weight to them."
3,Good set but cups are made in china...,"It's a good set compare to price, but the cups are mode in china so the quality is quite different from the rest of the set."
4,Good quality,"Very good basic dinnerware. If you are lookimg for good quality, basic dinnerware, this is for you."
1,Bad quality,"What a dissapointment. I received my Corelle Geometric 16-piece Dinnerware set, and I noticed that the bowl's pattern was missing on some parts of the bowl! And the bowls squares are all brown, but the plates/cups have three colors. It looks bizarre! So I will need to return the set. Next time I buy Corelle dishware I will go directly to Target. Also, the coffee mugs are stoneware, a different material, and while the plates/bowls are made in the USA, the cups are made in China...."
5,I love it,Nice design ... The best thing about this product is that there are no issues like scratches or marks after repetitive use. Recommended highly for this price range.
2,Color is not the same,"I ordered these thinking they had a black and grey pattern. I got them in yesterday and they are actually Brown, with Green and peach like color. This is not what I expected at all, not happy about the colors. They need to put a color description to match the actual item or change the picture."
2,Not happy,"I have owned Corelleware for all of my 40 years of marriage, and this is the first time that I had a set that has warped! My water is at 120 in my water heater and I don't dry dishes in the dishwasher, so I don't know why they would do this. Several of my plates and a couple saucers have done that. I wish Corelle would go back to making the cups in the same material as the rest of the dishes. Maybe I will try the Ultra if they come up with a nice pattern in it."
4,Very satisfied,I would like to report two things:1) I ordered two sets of this and they came in different shipments (which didnt bother me but i thought necessary to mention) one dinner plate in one of the shipments came broken BUT after calling the company (corelle not amazon) they agreed to send me a new plate so i was satisfied with that.2) the bowls have only brown colored squares which surprised me since i didnt notice them in the picture.
3,Not worth it,This wasn't at all what I expected the packaging came in a regular brown box. The bowls were too small and the mugs as well. Very disappointed because this was a gift for someone and wasn't package in its original packaging label. Although its durable I gave it 3 stars sucks.
2,Color not as pictured,"Color of the dishes in the picture looks to be black and a bit of light brown. however, the color is actually dark brown, light brown and a greenish color. After receiving the dishes, I went back to see this is how it is described (which I hadn't noticed). The picture is deceptive, it looks black which is what I had wanted. Love corelle though. Returning these and exchanging for a different Corelle pattern."
5,Very informative!,"Lots of useful information on the ability of the body and the differences faced by bone structures. Good yang sequence, very creative flows. The yin is fully explained and well done! I loaned it to other instructors and they bought copies too after viewing. Highly recommend to anyone wanting more knowledge to further their practice."
5,"SILENT THINK TIME - How To Bring Virtues Back into Our Home, Schools, Counseling and Work","Silent Think Time: How to Bring Virtues Back into Our Home, Schools, Counseling and WorkTHIS EXCELLENT 5 STAR QUALITY DVD IS EXTREMELY WELL DONE AND WORTH WELL OVER WHAT THE DVD ACTUALLY COSTS! I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT FOR EVERYONE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND PSYCHIC FLOWS OF ENERGY.

IT FOCUSES ON ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE CHAKRAS, AND ASPIRES PRACTICING DEVOTEES TO PURIFY THE KARMA, ALLOWING A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF AWARENESS OF MIND AND BODY CONTROL."
3,Falls short for me...,"After reading J. Gregory Keyes' ""Psi Corps/Bester"" trilogy, and then Peter David's ""Legions of Fire"" I was expecting something amazing with ""The Passing of the Techno-Mages"" that just did not come to be. Don't get me wrong, it's not as poorly written, and anoying as the current Star Wars ""Yuuzhan Vong"" war/saga! But this just did not have many characters that I cared about (so far). But, it's B5 and I'll continue the trilogy, but I wish it had MORE.. Can't explain it, but it fell short..."
4,"spidey it ain""t","As a longtime fan of b5 ""the Show"" I expected little from this tome, but it was recommended to me. I was very pleasantly surprised by its skill. As a believer in story over writing skill I was instantly hooked. It helps if you've watched both b5 and excalibur (so you have an understanding of Galen) but this story stands alone. Better than Straczynki's ""Spiderman"" and that's saying something! Looking forward to books 2 @ 3!"
3,Tech Wizards,"Cavelos has created the best B-5 trilogy yet. Her novels (Casting Shadows, Summoning Light, and Invoking Darkness) flesh out the background of the techno-mages and Galen's past. She meshes her material with the television series seamlessly and brings out nuances in character and situation. The relationship between the techno-mages and the Shadows is revealed in a striking manner that will satisfy any B-5 fan.Though the most exciting B-5 trilogy I have yet read, Cavelos has a tendency to focus on emotional-turmoil and bringing the pacing of the plot to a complete and utter halt so a character can brood, mope, brood some more, mope again. Making matters worse, she repeats the same trite descriptions describing these feelings of melancholy and worthlessness over and over. But the rewards of completing this trilogy is worth the pitfalls in the prose. A must for any B-5 fan."
2,"Dry, but very worthwhile for Babylon 5 and Crusade fans","I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Babylon 5 trilogies, however this book was the hardest for me to get through. I found the first 3/4 of the book very boring. I thought the story got too detailed into the nature of the technomage's power. It spent so much time talking about how Galen came up with equation after equation for his spells, I felt like I was in math class. However, I am very glad that I read the book. If you are a fan of Babylon 5 and/or Crusade, and you want to know everything there is to know about the Babylon 5 universe, then you need to read this book. All of the B5 trilogies fill in some gaps of peripheral stories that were hinted at in the show's episodes. This book really let's you get inside of one of my favorite characters, Galen. The end of the book was very moving, also."
2,eeeehhhhh,"While the way the technomages are shown combining guile with technology to was very interesting and almost made the books worth reading, the characters where every terrible marry sue cliche rolled together."
5,A Different Kind of Novel,"This is one of my favorite books. It's definitely a different kind of novel. It has a melancholy undertone that is purposeful and deliberate and keeps the reader in an emotional state with the lead character whose unique situation would lend to restlessness and brooding. I loved the weaving of history and fact with this work of fiction and Timothy Findley handled each situation beautifully. If you are longing for the typical novel, you won't find it here... thank goodness."
2,Too Confused for My Taste,"The book has its' interesting moments. A man who cannot die should be interesting. However, for us left brain people, the were just too many loose ends and unresolved issues. Also, the characters are without exception unlikable. I am not sure I can ever read anything Jung has written again without being prejudiced. If Pilgrim had lived forever, why was he always someone famous in the past and not so famous now. Not recommended."
2,Painful and Pompous,"I did not enjoy this book. It was painfully disjointed and not in a way that is simply hard to follow for those not familiar with challanging fiction, but instead, in a way that strives for intelligence but ends up with ridiculous babble. It also doesn't help that you never care about any of the characters becuase none of them are entirely likeable or fully explored. Pilgrim an entity of flesh and blood who has lived for an eternity and cannot die, intersting premise but it is never made interesting because it is like a foot note, like the rest of the characters. This is a mildly entertaining read at best."
2,"On the whole, a dissapointment","To begin with, a very nice premise. But Findley just doesn't deliver. It's not that I need every question answered after all life's not like that, no reason literature should be. But a little more in the way of resolution would have been nice.Mr. Findley also gets too wrapped up with being a writer sometimes...you know what I mean. You've got an interesting idea now just tell the story."
4,Pilgrim: A Timeless Character,"Timothy Findley has written another great work of art. Pilgrim, the central character, is a tragic figure not because he gave his life for a great cause; but he is tragic because he cannot seem to die (or is he just a bit schizo?..hmmm). The novel focuses on themes of trust, loss and redemption. In the end, though, I began trusting more of the bit characters (ie. Jung's wife) and empathizing with her loss more than the central figures. One note of dissappointment. The book tends to lose a little steam at the end. We simply just wish Pilgrim could successfully end himself and thus the novel. Does he succeed? We are still uncertain."
4,Thought Provoking...,"I picked this book up quite a few times before I finally decided to read it, basically because I thought it would delve too much into the Jungian concepts, etc, of which I don't have much knowledge...I'd just heard of Jung before I read this! However, the book was really quite interesting, and though it looks like a daunting read, its really not...its thought provoking (as my review title suggests!), and it makes you pause once in a while to think somethings through...something you hadnt really thought of much before, some new concept, and such, but still, it is perfectly understandable...and even if one doesn't have a lot of knowledge of psychology to start off with, it makes one interested in finding out more...or at least it did me!...I would reccomend this for anyone who is looking for a slightly challenging read."
4,An Inspiring Read,"Beautifully written paragraphs jump of the page throughout, I had to put this book down from time to time, to think over and enjoy what I had just read.So well written, if you like quality literature you will like this novel. The Novel touches on various historical figures bringing these famous true characters to life, in what is obviously Findley's personal opinions of their persona's based on historical knowledge.My only negative criticism of this book is that it moves a little slow in a few places, which made me a little impatient as to what was to happen next in the story.If you like quality literature, have any interest in psychology and/or history then this is the book for you, you will need a quiet room, roaring fire and a big mug of tea."
1,Complex and Complicated,"In a nutshell, Mr. Wheeler should NOT quit his day job. One of the most complex and complicated books ever read. He should lighten up his characters, situations, etc. Instead he waxed poetic which was not enjoyable. A book, any book, should entertain the reader, make the reader believe he/she is part of the story. This one did not."
4,Great backpack,I took a chance on this backpack because there was no picture but I had three boys who wanted Spongebob. It is navy blue and a great all around backpack for them to carry to school.
3,Could be better (or worse)!,"A very old oedipian theme (the attraction of a stepmother for her son), the fantams of a mad and handicapped man for physical strongness, and a magic chemical product which provide this strongness by sexual relation. It could have been a good film, and Shannon Tweed is sometimes very good, but there are too many silly shots."
5,"Moody, atmospheric, campy fun.","An interesting movie with Shannon Tweed relishing her role, just check out the fun she has in the out-takes at the end of the film! If you are a Shannon Tweed fan make this part of your collection today."
2,A very could be better movie,i watched this movie on the showtime.i expected it to be as good as body chemistry 4. but to my disappointment it was not. rather it was silly and very illogical. silly ending too.
1,hahahaha,"Sorry but is this film a comedy i couldn't stop laughing. From the start were we saw the 'evil villian' who looked suprisingly like DAVROS from Dr. Who. To the whole tree incedent, Billy's super powers, the scantily clad super villenesess. then at the end were it totally lost the plot giving the billy's gfriend super powers, electra's 'hold it in' line to get the cure from her step-son, DAVROS' flame throwing wheel chair, and electra gaining super powers herself for some bizzare reason which weren't even similar to billys."
1,The worst book about the adult experience I've ever read!,"I began this book with much anticipation. After the first chapter, I was offended and disappointed. But I kept reading hoping it would get better. It didn't. The author interviews only 45 women and bases his theories on loosely held evidence. I don't know how I am going to finish this book, but I have to becausee it's a required text for a college course. As a woman and student, I am thoroughly offended and don't regard any of Levinson's ideas as ""ground breaking"". His methods are unscientific and he is a rather outdated fool."
4,get the bigger size!,"It is a great product but I wish I would have gotten one size larger. I am using it to photograph my jewelry and manuvering inside of this little rectangle is difficult. I am getting good images though, so I would recomend the brand for sure!"
5,Great Condition,"I love this book, I don't get a chance to read it often, but it is definitely worth the purchase. The quality was decent, mine came from a library in New York. I guess people don't read inspirational books anymore."
2,Pat D,I usually buy these wipes for my father who is confined to bed and was very pleased with them as we used them along with the wet wipes. However recently the quality of the wipes has dropped and they are now quite flimsy and do not hold up well when used. They feel just a little bit stronger that ordinary tissue paper. This is a big disappointment to me as I can no longer use them as I used to. Really really disappointed please revert to the original quality.
1,Not good for incontinence! Rough!,I was expecting the disposable washcloths that I got in the hospital--the very soft ones. These are not those! Baby wipes are much better. Still looking for the very soft dry cloths that you can use with water and skin cleanser.
2,Not the ones they use on newborns,"As someone else mentioned, these are a lot rougher than the dry wipes that you get at the hospital for babies in spite of what the product description states. I was disappointed because of this and wouldn't buy these again. Now we have 350 to use. They seem ok when wet (definitely softer than when dry) but I think Viva paper towels, which are strong and soft, would probably be a cheaper and better alternative."
1,NOT for babies,These wipes are definitely NOT the ones used in hospital that we were looking for. These are so rough and scratchy that they should not be used on any baby skin. I would not use on adult skin either unless you were trying to exfoliate.We were disappointed at the misleading description of this product and will never buy again. Going to try the Medline dry cloths next and hope they are really the nice soft ones that were used in hospital.
3,Good for Everyday Use but Not on Baby,"These wipes provided the highest quantity for the lowest price. However, the wipes are much too hard to use on a newborn baby as a wet wipe. So I have decided to use the wipes for other purposes. Since my sole purpose for purchasing the cloths was to have the same wipes used by the hospital on my newborn, I only gave the wipes a 3-rating. The wipes are durable enough for light cleaning, wiping, etc. If that were my purpose for getting the wipes, then they would have received a much higher rating.Note that the return policy only has a 30-day window. With a newborn baby, it can be hard to meet this timeframe for a return. So keep this in mind if you are buying the wipes to test on your newborn."
4,Good book but mostly photos,"This book by John McCabe on the great Laurel and Hardy is a very good one IF you want a huge quantity of high-quality photographs from their movies, along with a few photos from other sources. There are extensive credits and a rating by the author on the overall quality on each film. There are also a few good articles here on Laurel and Hardy's work, and a tribute section with interesting quotes about them, mostly from other famous comedians. But there is not much information here on their movies or analysis of them. The text that follows along with the photographs from each film is a summary of the film and not background information or analysis. I don't mean to be critical here, I'm just saying that this book is a good choice only if you're mainly interested in photographs."
2,not overly impressed. but OK,This unit worked ok. I was not overly impressed with the performance of the soundings. The suction was not the best I was able to locate fish and I did get fish were I did not expect too and I used the fish finder to locate those fish. I would give the fish finder a solid OK not bad.
4,Practical and precise,An interesting tome that is practical and precise. Valuable for the first time traveler to Paris. Bon voyage!
2,Not Much Better than a Vocabulary List,"While the graphics are cute and the pronunciation guides are somewhat helpful, I was disappointed in this book. It seemed to me to be only one step better than any vocabulary list you can find. I found it only minimally useful."
4,A Great Read,"I have really enjoyed each of Joanne Fluke's novels. She makes you wish you were living in that small town, eating cookies for breakfast. This was another nice installment letting us learn a little more about each of the characters. The only reason I gave this four rather than five stars was because I am a little dissapointed there was no real further development of Hannah's personal life. That of course will keep me waiting for the next book, so maybe it was the point..."
3,"good, but not my favorite","I thought the book was good, but nothing really made it stand out either. People will like it because it is a series and there are lots of them and it's a genre that has a following. Strikes me as very similar to the ""The Cat Who..."" series as far as one dimensional characterizations and story style. The recipes are a fun addition and actually work as part of the story rather than being a gimmick like some ""mysteries with recipes"" I've read have been... though I wonder how Hannah's bakery stays in business, the recipes I've tried aren't that great. The Blue Blueberry Muffins didn't taste very much like blueberry, were too sweet and were NOT blue, more a nasty battleship gray! All in all a comfortable series to turn to with generally likeable characters but not at the head of the reading list for me."
4,enjoyable easy read,they are not gorey. I figure them out a little early but I enjoy them. I like the recipes included
4,Great edible mystery,"Joanne Fluke is great, her recipes are great and so are her stories, Have read quite a few of her Hannah Swenson mysteries and I love how she ties her main character in with her family and they solve the mystery together. You'll get hooked too once you have read a couple of this series. Love her cat character, finally figured out who she had named him after."
4,A Little More Substance,"Fluke's mysteries are light reading, and Hannah, the lead character, is real with all the ups and downs and concerns of real life. The BLUEBERRY MUFFIN MURDER is enjoyable, but when you add seven recipes and the corresponding directions for those recipes, you cut into the substance of the novel. Five recipes per novel would be a happy medium lending more pages for the story line. Culinary mysteries are some of my favorites, and this one is a pretty good read. And, I love the cat!"
4,cozy and quirky,"I am enjoyingthese books more and more. They are not overly realistic - but it's fun to 'hang' with the characters. The author spent a lot of time in this one dealing with Hannah's love life (really - her lack of love life!) I personally, am not finding either 'suitor' all that appealing. How does this girl go on and on without 'any'? The mystery isn't hard to figure out - but the appeal here is the atmostphere and feeling like you are hanging out with friends. Great if you like cozies."
5,Great Book,"All the Hannah Swenson Mysteries are wonderful they are light hearted make you smile mysteries ""cozy mysteries"" (not scary, gory, or sad) but they are actually really good ""keep you guessing"" mysteries. Plus if you are someone who likes to bake you will love all the recipes that come with each story. I just book mark each recipe as I come to it on my Kindle and then they are super easy to find when I need them. I would recommend the entire series. Also the author, Joanne Fluke, is super nice. I e-mailed her once, when one of the cookie recipes I made did not turn out right, just to see what I might have done wrong and she actually e-mailed me back a couple hours later. Just a super nice person and a wonderful mystery writer."
2,Hannah Like Coffee!,"Did you know that? It must be important, because Ms. Fluke mentions it about 8 times in every one of these books. Anyway, this is another preposterous, cliche-ridden ""mystery"" that relies heavily on coincidence after coincidence. There are so many characters...Paul, Bill, Mike, Isobel, Andrea, Janie, Alex, Sally, Luanne, Norman, Delores, Greg, Tracey, Lisa, Lisa's father, etc. etc...that I found it difficult to keep track of all of them. The author has a habit of starting a subplot and then never going back to it. Like Norman and Hannah designing a dream house for a contest. It's mentioned once or twice and then is swallowed up in an endless, painfully predictable web of cookies, murder, cookies, romance, cookies, murder, cookies. Oh and plucky Hanna solves the case. Bottom line: I knew the murderer after the first chapter. And you will too. So another Mystery Fail for Ms. Fluke."
2,Not well written,"I like the occasional murder mystery and I always have one or two books going at any one time, so I do read. I couldn't even finish this book. The characters weren't appealing and visualizations for both people and place were lacking. It's really cold there, ok, but how cold? There was no sense of history for the recreated home of the town's first mayor- yep, it's nice and it's got a lot of old stuff. There was no sense of time- one minute it's the wee hours of the morning, and the next thing you know the mid day tour had begun. I couldn't even get a good handle on how old our heroine is (roughly speaking).Throwing in a couple of recipes didn't make up for the general lack of writing skill. Sorry, but it's a 2 star book all the way."
4,A pleasant but conventional cosy,"Hannah Swensen is the baker of delicious pastries, as well as the amatuer sleuth that keeps running into dead bodies in a small Minnesota town. Her investigative technique is straightforward and not very imaginative, but the delicious recipes and the warm personal interplay make it for a satisfying and occasionally funny read. One or two of the supporting characters are interesting, but most others are rather flat plot devices, including the victim.The book does not demand much exertion from the reader, and neither strives for nor achieves a deep emotional engagement, but it works admirably as a cosy diversion."
4,Not quite five star,I don't place this in Haddam's top tier (which starts with Precious Blood and A Stillness in Bethlehem) but it's not far below. The puzzle is solid and the clues good. The milieu is an indictment of certain trends in academia; whether it is realistic or a base caricature (or worse) may depend on your personal politics.
5,Sienna brown pumps,"These shoes are beautiful, the leather is soft and smooth. The shoesarrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner. Well worth the priceand more."
3,Passable,"From the author best known to the general public for instigating the ""Iron John"" men's movement, this volume won a National Book Award back in 1960-something, but as poetry it's not notably better or worse than the norm. The weakest poems are the ones that come off as relatively straightforward protest pieces (one section is titled ""The Vietnam War""), but at least they're not as bad as the stupid titles might suggest. (I tend to quake in fear when I encounter poems called ""Listening to President Kennedy Lie about the Cuban Invasion"".) Elsewhere, Bly indulges freely, and with sporadic success, in the kind of imagistic, semi-surreal verse that characterizes much contemporary poetry. It's not bad; Bly, despite his overuse of ""there is/are"" constructions, comes up with some nice lines now and then. But only ardent fans of 60's-style anti-war poetry really need this stuff."
4,The Bells of Sweet St.Annes,"I don't think any one who has emigrated from one country to another or perhaps even moved cross-country in the US wouldfind fault with the ""Bells of Sweet St Anne's"". The CD is worththe song alone. At least I felt that way..."
4,Must Have Resource,"This text is written with American equivelents so conversion and guessing quantities is not necessary. The recipes make delicious dishes and as advertised, in "" 45 minutes or less"". The cooking methiods and hand me down recipes are perfect to experience the freshness that is Italian in a short time frame of preparation. It is such a better option than the fast food take out routine! This is an abslolute must for a diversified culinary kitchen!"
2,Just ok,"The book has good recipes but only has 14 photos in the entire book, and those are not particularly compelling."
2,Too Few Pictures,I just got this book but I am disappointed. When I'm following a recipe I need to know what the end product looks like. This cookbook only has a small handful of pictures. It will be difficult for me to try the recipes now.
5,My new favorite cookbook,"I don't think that I've ever written an Amazon review before, but I just had to chime in about this book. It's simply fantastic, and everything IS really easy and straightforward to prepare. I love to cook but hate to fuss, and this is the perfect cookbook for me. The ingredients are all easy to find and there are always the right number (not a lot of extra ones that don't make much of a difference). I can recommend this book unequivocally."
5,Very usable Italian cookbook for home cook,"The recipes are very easy to follow, delicious and the ingredients are easily accesible. The cooking techniques and preparations are straightforward and easy enough to follow. Each recipe come with an estimate time to prepare it from start to finish and it really does falls within that time limit. I can easily use 70% of the recipes in this book for everyday cooking, not just for special occasion."
5,I found a new favorite!,"I""m so glad I ordered this cookbook. The recipes are easy and the ingredients (except for a couple of things) are available in the local supermarket. Being of Italian descent myself, I was looking for something different than the usual that was simple & quick to prepare. I found it in this cookbook and every one of recipes that I tried was delicious. The Meat Pie ""Pizza Style"" is a huge hit in my house. Bravo!"
1,Be careful with these reviews...,"First of all, do not trust these positive reviews. The company includes a card with the watch that says if you leave a positive review on Amazon, they will extend your warranty for one-year. And from my experience so far with Stuhrling, you may need it. I am on my third watch of this style. On the previous two watches, the minute hand fell off inside the watch. I did not drop or handle the watches roughly, the hand just fell off. As far as aesthetics, the watch looks great - it is a larger watch so I do have several dress shirts that do not accommodate the extra size in the wrist area. I'll have to check back in when I have had the watch for a longer time period - my first watch lasted 32 days, the second arrived broken, and my current is running well three weeks in."
2,Form before function,"This is certainly a great looking watch. For that reason, it earns a star. Unfortunately, the movement leaves much to be desired. Perhaps I received a defective watch, but mine loses 5 - 7 minutes a day. Also, the lack of a second hand doesn't help. Not too impressive for my first Stuhrling. This watch is getting returned and I'll replace it with something from the always reliable Seiko brand."
5,"Great calendar, but must order!","I've had Horsefeathers calendars for several years now, but no one in my city seems to carry them, so I have to order online. Pity, because this is the only calendar I've ever seen to really capture the spirit of the draft horse. Beautiful work, beautiful photography, and it should be carried by everyone!"
3,Disappointing quality,"This has been the least satisfactory of all my Kreg purchases. While not terrible, the molding of these parts was somewhat flawed, and I would class them as seconds which should not have made it past QC. Hopefully, your luck will be better."
4,Friends Desk,"I have the Kreg slide installer and since I was helping a friend buid a desk and cabinets, we needed these for file cabinets slides. These help but are not precise, you will neeed to fine tune the slides, great price and I like the prime. Use Kreg pocket jointery for my face frames, great product."
5,Why did'nt I think of this,"Great item, one of those you scratch your head and say why did'nt I think of that. Like all Kreg products, top of the line."
4,kreg drawer slide mounting tool brackets,"These are not necessary with small drawers. However when lining up large drawers, they make a frustrating job much easier. It should be noted that they really work best with the bracket mounting tool also manufactured by Kreg."
4,Simple and Accurate,"I've used this jig on more than a few jobs installing drawers to ball bearing guides that I previously installed using spacers.This jig works great. It makes the job of installing your drawers a whole lot easier and faster. Just be sure to build your drawers so you have at least a 1/4"" space between the drawer bottom and the stile. This jig won't work on cabinets with no stiles between the drawers. I suppose any reasonably competent woodworker could make a jig like this out of wood, but these are light weight, unbreakable and accurate."
4,Great with some difficulties.,"Worked great for my upper drawers in my cabinets. However I installed drawers in the lower portion of the cabinets as well. I had to modify the mounting brackets with block of wood to clamp it to the side of the stiles face of the cabinet, in order to place my middle drawer.I'm still glad I got them. It saved me a lot of time."
1,Sloppy and full of errors,"Was this book edited at all? It reads as though it was written in one weekend, with no references other than the Yellow Pages. For example, the author ""helpfully"" provides us with a listing of good temp agencies--suspiciously, every single one begins with the letter ""A"". You have to wonder if any real research was done in other parts of the book, or if the author just copied down names and addresses from the phone book (as she clearly did in this section). The writing is repetitive and full of generalizations, and many of her ""facts"" are just plain wrong. I moved to Chicago three years ago, and I wish I hadn't had this book then."
5,A fine tool for fine work,"I bought this iron to solder 22 connections to a circuit board not much larger than a postage stamp. My eighty year old hands and eyes approached this task with a lot of trepidation, but the iron performed flawlessly. Just the right amount of heat to do the job. I would prefer a chisel tip to the round one but it did the job. It would not work well for larger work. For regular wiring get at least 40 watts or larger."
5,Perfect for micro soldering application,"When the ipod i received from ebay I found out had a dead battery, I decided to DIY it. This low-wattage iron was perfect for those small connections, without having damaging heat for the delicate components on the cardstock thin circuit board. It was a successful operation thanks to this tool!"
4,Coopertools SP12 Soldering Iron,"Im a pc/electronic tech. and been using traditional soldering iron for a couple ofyears and been looking for a smaller iron and finally found this tool.Pros:-its small,light just like a pencil-easy to navigate since it just like a pencilCons:-I noticed that the tip/point is not replaceableso far its good in making small electronic project, not recommended using it tounsolder component in a large circuit eg. LCDTV boards, pc boards."
5,Much much better than cheaper soldering irons,"I didn't want to spend this much for a little soldering iron, but I needed something to solder PCB boards for little amps/dacs. It's hard to believe it's only 12 watts, because it seems much hotter than that. It heats up very very quickly and does the job very very well. The pencil tip is not perfect like my other one, but I think that is because a pencil point can break very easily. They made it very close to the end, just the perfect amount that it gives a very nice pinpoint without much worry about breaking off. If you solder little amps or dacs and need something for those very small and tight to reach spaces, get this thing and you will not regret it one second. The best thing about it is that the whole end point heats the solder, not just one side like my other cheap ones did. I used to have to search for the side that had the heat and that was very very annoying and this is like a breeze now. Much much better than the cheap ones here."
1,D.O.A.,"Won't even heat right out of the package. If it worked the price was right, now I'm not sure it's even worth returning."
1,Poor,"Shortly after I got the iron, the tip fell out.Moreover, its heat was to low to sufficiently melt the solder(at least in a reasonable amount of time)."
1,Bait and Switch,"This book is not a Spanish-English Dictionary of Internet & Computer terms. I work in Latin America, doing technical service for computers of Americans and also teaching Basic Computing to Spanish speakers. This book:1. Does not give Spanish terms. - ex. ""Hard Disk"" does not mention ""Disco Duro"" as the popular Spanish term.2. Gives poor definitions. - ex. ""Crash"" defined as ""An important computer failure"". Well, duh. What is should say is something to the effect of when there is a problem with either a program, hardware, or the combination, the system must be restarted to correct it.3. Does not list many important everyday items. - ex. ""Network Card"", or ""NIC"" are not listed.4. Does list old and very outdated items. - ex. ""Keypunch"" - when was the last time anyone used a keypunch machine?All this to say - do not buy this book. It is a waste of pulp!"
2,Somewhat funny - certainly a better rental than a buy,"I've grown a little tired of movies that push self-discovery over a simple plot. In this case, guy owns a record shop, rightfully loses girl because he is a self-professed jerk, and his ex continues to talk to him, mainly because he is John Cusack. Generally, John Cusack films are amongst the most entertaining movies out there, but this film makes me wish Cusack had the genetic ability of Ralph Macchio to always be that High School Guy. The best thing about this film is Cusack's brief dalliance with Lisa Bonet. Too bad Dr. Huxtable wasn't around to save the rest of the plot."
2,This was meant to be set in the UK anyway,"I couldn't see the point of this movie. I saw it inflight and kept wanting to shout out at John Cusak: ""Don't be a wuss, stop whining the whole time! Be a man! Go join the foreign legion or paint your house or something"". Even though this was based on a UK novel, you wouldn'f find an English bloke behaving like such a pathetic looser. No relationship? No problem, he'd be off down the pub with his mates."
2,I'm too old for this,"My wife and I watched for about fourty minutes, didn't laugh once, and hit the stop button. We are seniors, so I guess this must be a young persons movie. GCH."
2,Bad Film,"It was a bad film, and it bored me to tears. I doubt I'll watch it again. There were a few good scenes, but nothing I remember."
2,More than 5 reasons to avoid this movie,"There are numerous reasons to avoid this movie but i will only list the obvious ones. High Fidelity is about an underachieving, self pitying, sarcastic record store owner (played by Cusack) who just broke up with a long time girlfriend. Cusack's character then spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out what went wrong. Cusack gives an ok performance primarily because he has played the same character in at least 4 other movies. The rest of the cast is quite forgettable including the irritating Jack Black and the usually funny Tim Robbins. The plot is very thin and the script is just not funny (yes I did understand the ""humour"" in the musical references). Even the soundtrack is a letdown in this film. High Fidelity is a bad romantic comedy which lacks romance and humor. Actually the only thing missing from this bad romantic comedy is Meg Ryan."
2,The book is much better,"Yes, I loved the book, humor was deeply embedded on its text. but I fail to match the Rob Gordon, the main character, with John Cusack's performance. Laura is a little more credible, but still unconvincing. My advise: just read the book."
5,High Fidelity,"This film is definately worth a watch, not only is it incredibly witty, not only does it have a great sound track that rocks, not only does it have a great cast of not-so-well known actors doing a first class job, but you know exactly what this guy feels like, you've been there and done that, and at the end you know what you've got is the best you're going to get because the dream of lingerie scattered across your bedroom floor, boys, is just a fantasy. The cotton knickers that have been through the wash sixteen hundred times is reality and what matters!!! Confused? Watch High Fidelity."
3,"Excellent book, good movie","If you're already familiar with the book, then none of the plot elements will surprise you. Besides the changes in the locale and the genre of music that the protagonist is most obsessed about, it is actually a very loyal adaptation. Heck, large chunks of the book are recited in verbatim! But the film still didn't sit well with me. I felt that they've softened the protagonist a little too much to make him more palatable to the audience. Most notably, I cite the part when John Cusack offered to put out the single by those skateboard punk rockers. Rob Fleming in the book would've never done that. And I also cite the part after Laura's father's funeral when Laura wanted to have sex in the car to assuage her grief and Rob Gordon didn't make that cruel comment that Rob Fleming in the book did."
3,"Funny, satisfying movie.",Kept my interest. Made me chuckle. Classic John Cusack. Lighthearted. Good enough to watch again.The streaming was flawless. Good sound equality -- important because of all the good music.
4,This Is A Male Version Of A Chick Movie,"Nah, don't get bent out of shape, I liked this movie fine, but it just is. Sure it had Jack Black, more cussing than a sailor's convention, was set in a run-down vintage record store, had great music, a cameo by The Boss, and some bitingly dead-on dissing courtesy of Tim Robbins, but this was way too cerebral and emotionally-fueled not to invite comparisons to the sort of films that get deliberately targeted at women. Think about it, it's all dialogue-driven, the main character, well-played by Cusack, does nothing but talk, talk, talk, as he agonizes over every relationship he's ever had, which he can break down and list in order of pain and regret, and it centers around the one person he is convinced he loves. It's got all the makings of a brilliant chick flick!"
1,It's rare that I cannot sit through a movie,"High Fidelity is the worst movie I've seen John Cusack in. His character is a self-indulgent, whiny jerk who spends the first hour of the movie talking to the screen about all of his past relationships while going through a breakup that isn't a breakup. I really couldn't relate at all to the character. He's just horrible. He sleeps with everyone and then whines about the various flaws of each of his former lovers. I just don't get the movie. It bored and irritated me. It's slow paced, full of immaturity and shallow people (not just Cusack's character) and just plain silly. I managed to watch an hour but I was drooling and slobbering by that point and had to go to sleep.Why you won't like this movie: slow paced, self-indulgent, boring plot, main character talks directly to the camera"
2,"More music, less whine please","Oh, that it had indeed been more about the music - i.e. the REAL ""High Fidelity"" - and less, a lot less, about some guy's loves lost. Like, who cares? I'm going to forget about this one a LOT faster than the 1st Stiff Little Fingers LP which is dispensed with all too quickly in the film. If you like music, avoid this one. If you like whine, Whine, WHINE though, go for it."
4,High quality,"Audiophile Rob Gordon (John Cusack) runs his record store, pines over his latest failed relationship, and looks for the next. That's about it. No high concept plot here. Just a very insightful film about smart people living a little off the mainstream and trying to make it work. I would like to live in the same neighborhood with these characters and hang out with them, which is just about the highest praise I can think to give. The whole cast is outstanding, but Jack Black and Todd Louiso stand out as Rob's employees, who were hired to work part-time but have made the record store the center of their lives."
5,High Fidelity,"This was a Christmas gift to my son and he has been enjoying it since Christmas, December 25, 2012 and he really likes it."
1,Yuck,I'm sure some people will like it. I really like John Cusack as an actor but not in this very frenetic movie that assaulted my senses. I grew impatient with it very quickly and turned to something else.
3,Here's the hustle,"First things first; I liked this film.But as with 'Trainspotting', it was too calculating in it's attempts at hipness and too 'cute' to strike me as a brilliant film, not to mention spare. In other words, Cusack (in his co-writer's mind) is seemingly trying to write another cult classic a la 'Say Anything', but it doesn't work here.That being said, there are some great moments in the film; my favourite is when Tim Robbins shows up in the record store--the fantasy sequence had me roaring with laughter... unfortunately the rest of the film isn't nearly as funny, and actually drags its feet far too often.The dialogue also suffers from the 'top ten' gimmick, which hasn't been funny for about a decade (you'd think Letterman would figure it out as well), and even as a novelty, it gets tired really fast. Performances are fine across the board, but the film reaches for the moon and just barely snags a star."
3,Cusak Returns to his Roots,"I'm reviewing this movie as a Cusak fan. Here John Cusak returns to his comedic roots, and that makes it a treat for Cusak fans. Forget ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" or ""Being John Malkovich."" This is the Cusak character you remember from ""Better off Dead"" and ""Say Anything,"" except the character is a little more mature."
4,Too Close To Home,"this movie nailed it on the head, well for me anyway..from being obsessed with making mix tapes..to not knowing where your life is heading..to troubled realtionships and the struggles that come from it..i think i might be Rob Gordon..which i dont know is a good or bad thing..but i do know i love this movie..if your a music fan or have spent any time scouring used record shops while your wife or girlfriend is at home pissed because there is no room for anymore records. then you will love and relate to this move...its a true to life love story.. a story of trying to figure out where you screwed up in life..and a very funny comedy."
4,I Should Be So Lucky,"Even Joan Cusack gave a decent performance in this excellent movie. It's a boy loses girl, boy meets girl in flashback, boy and girl goes through a lot of stuff, kinda flick. Not sure this is worth [the money]... I plan to buy the used copy available on Amazon... Anyway, Jack Black gives another of his crazed performances, Tim Robbins was tolerable (and he gets his teeth busted out in a fantasy sequence)...Could be on pretty much any Top Five list..."
4,Excellent comedy!!!,"VERY FUNNY! AWESOME FILM! Seriously, it's so so so funny! John Cusack is perfect for this role, perfect! He's exactly the guy they needed. Tim Robbins is funny too, especially in the imagination scene!!! You'll know what I mean when you'll see it! This is the perfect film for people who have a little culture in music, and who are not afraid of vulgarity or that enjoy rock and roll...The story is about a man that owns a Vinyl discs shop who tries to find back the girls he loved during his years of high school...believe me, along with Meet The Parents, this is one of the best comedies of this year, and a couple of years before...in my opinion. The mentality of Cusack and his work mates is just so coloured, it's awesome, it's funny, it's exactly how I imagine that kind of person for real...This is perfect to watch with a bunch of friends followed by Dead Alive or Bad Taste....excellent comedy!"
4,"If you wanted to mess me up, you needed to get to me sooner.","This movie is a big mix of things. Drama, humour, tradgy and good story. The main character isn't exactly likable, but he isn't someone to hate either. He is an average guy trying to find meaning in his life and relationships. Overall it is quite enjoyable and has a good rewatch value. Worth the money."
2,Barely Tolerable,"I hate to contradict all the rave reviews below, but I found this movie extremely lame and barely watchable. John Cusak plays a completely self-centered jerk who wonders why all his girlfriends keep leaving him. It's painful to watch, and not funny. Sorry folks, but self-pity is not entertaining, and this movie consists of John Cusak's character feeling sorry for himself and whining into the camera. The whole movie is a rip-off of the Woody Allen movies of yesteryears, such as Annie Hall. There's the main character breaking the action to direct address the camera, and there's the hapless nerd who can't keep his girlfriend. It's an old story that's been done many times before and much better. 'nuff said."
3,NOT SO GREAT AS PEOPLE KEEP SAYING,"Altough Cusack is clearly in one of his great performances ever, this movie has so many high-and-lows that looses its momentum along the middle. It's a good history, well told and directed, but there are many weak spots: Robbins appearance adds nothing; JAck Black's performance is awful; the plot sometimes is very, very slow to my taste; the musical references quoted by the characters are too few - they could have been more explored. ANyway, it's above average, considering the unbeliavable amount of garbage the movie productors give us nowadays."
4,"Pienso, por lo tanto estoy - and the dish ran away with . .",Natasha is to Richard's IV as John's III is to Robert's twenty-thousand.Otherwise a rather good-hearted look at a bone-headed jerk; but all bets are off when Natasha enters the shop. Well worth a peek just for one single look at what RJ & Natalie gave us.Good God's Grief I'm easy.
1,I'm sorry I spent money on this,"I couldn't even bring myself to watch it to the end. The main character made me sick, he is such a whiny, self- absorbed loser. The only times he takes a break from the whininess, he switches to being aggressive and immature. Especially when he learns that his ex-girlfriend makes love to her new boyfriend, then he completely freaks out and thinks it's so unfair. It's okay for him though to have slept with somebody else while they were together?! What a pathetic, two-faced jerk.Oh yes, and then there's his little posse of loser friends with whom he owns a record store. Delightful and pretty (NOT!) creatures, who think they know everything there is to know about music even though they know only about a few music styles that they deem the greatest and can't even play an instrument or something. What they can do, though, is scream at customers who dare to have their own, different musical taste."
5,Masterful,"this movie was hilarious! I thouroughly enjoyed his seemingly endless top 5 lists, and found myself making my own lists as well. Catherine zeta-Jones does a marvelous job as Charlie, his #4 on the worst break-up list."
4,"Inteligent, funny and moving.","This is my favourite movie of year 2000. Jack Black is histerical as Barry, and Todd Louiso, playing the same character he did in Jerry Maguire -except here he is not a nanny here, or child technician, as he described the job- is great, and the rest of the cast does a wonderful job. Just wanted to say it is a great move, don't feel like reviewing. Watch it, you will like it, unless you are bitter and numb."
4,great movie,"great movie. renting it online was easy. disappointed that i rented it for my roku and when it started skipping on that, amazon wouldn’t let me watch it from my computer."
5,One of my favorite films of all time,"This is a great DVD that no one even remotely interested in music/romance/Jack Black should miss. The DVD has great features, amazing sound and picture quality, and the movie itself is amazing. John Cusack is amazing as the brooding, wounded romancer, spinning his tale of love found and lost, with some great scenes in his record store woven into the mix. And Jack Black (hilarious) plays an eccentric lackey who comes through for his friend in the end. AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!!"
4,A DIFFERENT KIND OF FILM,"JOHN CUSACK HAS PROVED AGAIN WITH HIS CHAMELION ACTING THAT HE CAN PLAY ANY ROLE REQUIRED.A STORY ABOUT A RECORD SHOP OWNER WHO LISTS THROUGH HIS PREVIOUS GIRLFRIENDS,WHILST TRYING TO WIN BACK THE PRESENT ONE WHO HAS JUST DUMPED HIM.THIS FILM WONT BE EVERYONES FAVOURITE,BUT IT HAS A LOT OF STYLE AND FLAVOUR.I WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS A MUSIC FAN,JUST BEEN DUMPED OR LOVES JOHN CUSACK"
2,Uninteresting Despite Good Performances,Mostly uninteresting. John Cusack owns a record store and talks to the camera about his past troubles with different girlfriends. Lacking in humor and characters to care about. Catherine Zeta Jones plays one of his ex's.
1,I saw this before,This movie is about John Cusack playing the exact same charecter he has played since Say Anything.I must say this one is a Snoozer.
1,Love Cusak - Hate the movie,"This was a boring and insipid movie. Slow moving and bitter there were only a few redeeming moments. The fellow clerks were funny from time to time, but the humor never took root. Give this one a BIG pass."
2,He should have stuck to pointe blank,"After a beautiful come back with Grosse Pointe Blank...to the comedic medium, Cusack flubs it in this horrific movie.He loses all remnants of the nice guy image and the actress who plays his girlfriend is just awful.Distracted by her awful haircut the most interesting charactersin the whole film were his music shop employees.Here is a clue, Cusack, you are a product of the 80's. I first saw you in Sixteen Candles. Don't even try to go grunge it ruins it for me...Stick to what you know...let's hope we see better of you in ""Serendipity"""
1,Grown-up Ferris Bueller,"If you haven't seen this, don't bother. I expected more, since it is John Cusack, whom I like, but I found it pretty much an adult Ferris Bueller, which doesn't work well. Expecting a comedy - maybe that was my mistake - I was very let down. The 30-something male narrating the story of his failed love life made me wonder if Hollywood is really that hard up for movie ideas. Maybe it was done better in book form, as most are. Most of the music I'd never heard of (seems to be the sub-culture of American pop) and the ""story line"" was uninteresting psycho-babble. It Definitely wasn't worth the $3 and 2 1/2 hours of my time."
2,The Book is Better,"And I really like John Cusack.Movie is definitely worth watching, but I had very high hopes and they were not quite met. Watch the movie, enjoy the book and check out Grosse Pointe Blank! Great soundtrack on that movie as well"
2,Much too close to the book,"I was disappointed by the film's inability to 'open out' the book. This isn't the fault of the cast - they pretty much all turn in likeable performances (although Joan Cusack if miscast), but way too much of the film is Cusack talking to camera, and almost all the dialog is lifted straight out of the book. What deviations there are (skateboarding kids who turn out to be talented artistes) are jarring and out of key with the rest of the film. If you've read the book within the past six months I'd suggest you wait awhile."
2,"Fine Acting, crumby story","If you enjoy watching a guy whine for two hours about his love life this movie is for you. However, why pay for it? You can go down to the nearest bar and listen to a drunk for free. John Cusack plays a whiney, mad guy who yacks to the camera and does it well. But it is still a bore."
2,Good Movie - Horrible DVD - reject the forced trailors!,"This is a great movie, one of my personal favorites. I will not be buying on DVD however, because while it may boast bonus features and nice video/sound, it's not worth having to sit through eight minutes of trailors when you put in the disc -which, unlike a VHS, you can't skip over or fast forward. This is a horrible ploy that consumer's can't just accept. Return your DVD's if they feature this kind of forced advertising, and they'll get the picture. Your paying a lot of money for these things - the day they start handing out DVD's for free, I won't mind.The movie itself is wonderfully written and the acting is great. I will be enjoying this for years to come - on VHS."
1,Another whiney Cusack movie,"What to say about this film? Well, Cusack has definitely done better. The most interesting characters in the movie are Barry and Dick (Jack Black and Tom Louiso). It would be a much better movie if they were incorporated more into the story rather than appearing here and there when the story gets a bit slow. Unfortunately, the little they do appear doesn't make the film any better.If you want to see a movie about a guy who runs a record store and don't want to deal with depression, check out Empire Records."
1,I thanked God when I watched this movie,"for making some Japanese electronics manufacturer invent the Fast Forward button. Although I haven't read the book, I am sure that the book is better than the movie since you can't get any worse than a movie about a guy whining for two hours about his failed relationships. After 10 minutes of watching this ""movie about nothing"" (and as opposed to Seinfeld, it's also worth nothing) I was hoping that the next 10 minutes would get better. When it didn't I gave it another chance. After about 30 minutes my finger hit the magic button and fast forwarded the movie all the way to the end just to see that nothing really happens and about 90% of the time even in fast forward mode I could still recognize John Cusack talking to the camera and whining about his life.Thank you again JVC (or whoever you are) for inventing the fast forward button."
2,What a waste of time...,"I watched it because of John Cusack... that's all... and what a waste of time it was watching him play some pathetic immature idealistic loser... Then there's the stupid way his character handles relationships - do guys like that really attract that many girls in real life? The fat guy was funny in the beginning, but it gets tiring after a while trying to listen to all his snobbish opinions about music... The novel is much better than the film."
1,Pointless stupid movie,"This is easily the worst movie in recent years, aside from the dreadful 'Memento'. Let's get one thing straight here - John Cusack is not funny, and never has been. Over 2 hours of pointless story telling here. It's no wonder Cusack funded the film himself - everbody else could see what a silly storyline it was. The DVD contains deleted scenes. However, all of the movie should be deleted. Life is too short for poor quality films like this. Avoid at all costs."
1,P.O.S. Read the book.,"What an offense to frontal lobes everywhere. The book was a riot, the characters were engaging AND REAL, not like these nihilist puppets. A waste of every actor in the film (all of whose work I have enjoyed elsewhere but each of whom owes me a handwritten letter of apology for this one). Mr. Springsteen, how could you have given 30 seconds of your valuable time to this pile of festering refuse? I wish Amazon allowed no-star reviews."
3,The Audio quality is BAD,"The movie is alright, but the audio quality is super bad. The volume is too low and even after I used 2 different speakers (which have worked fine for every movie I watched at home), I had difficulty listening to this one."
4,Very funny,"This movie starts off with a bang as Rob (the protaganist) is throwing a fit as his girlfriend, Laura is leaving him. Despite the lively start, the movie is a little hard to get into at first but as we see Rob recount failed relationship after failed relationship and his less than calm, cool, collected reaction to being dumped, his life becomes a hilarious running joke. The backdrop is a used record store in Chicago owned by Rob and his two employees, who he somehow tolerates without firing them. These two characters ad to the movie as well developed comic characters. Your sides will ache as you see them kick customers out whose taste in music they don't like. Finally, the feel good ending keeps us laughing without becoming sappy. If you have the right type of sense of humor, this movie is great."
4,Pretty darn good! And funny too!,"This movie is worth watching a few times. As for John Cusack's character, I thought my own brother was obsessed with his record collection. LOL"
4,Cusack Doing What He Does Best!,"Cusack seems to fit these roles. The dark, lovelost, sarcastic self abuser who, though seemingly utterly disfuctional, actually taps into the heart of ""normal"". Especially when dealing with issues of growing up and relationships. In this way, High Fidelity could in fact be the continuing story of Better Off Dead. Or any number of other Cusack greats. The other factors that make this a stand out are the references to bands and music you thought only you still held onto. Especially when his 2 employees get into the nitpicking realm of conosieurrism (sp?) of music collecting. Top 5 reasons to by this movie, 5-Musical memories 4-The break-up stories 3-The heckle and jeckle dialogue of the employees 2- great script 1- John Cusack!"
3,I'll take the soundtrack instead,"Rob Gordon (John Cusack) didn't exactly become what he wanted. He owns a vintage vinyl record shop and works it with a pair of oddball salespeople who are possibly more disenfranchised than he. His top career choice would have been writer for Rolling Stone Magazine, but there were four others as well.Now, his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) is moving out of their apartment. She was five on his Top Five list of most devastating breakups. Rob believes girls 1-4 somehow set him up for failure for this relationship. So, he contacts the ones who got away to find out why.It took me a while to warm up to character, story, etc, but my husband got it. This may be the male equivalent of the chick flick. Guy flick? Fellow film? For some reason, none of them have the same ring. While I didn't quite get the film, I'd highly recommend the soundtrack. Great tunes!Rebecca Kyle, December 2008"
1,What a waste !,"I purchased this camera for christmas as a gift to myself. After turning it on, it got to the logo then shut off. I tried different batteries, but it has NEVER taken one picture or stayed on long enough to do anything. What a waste of money and a waste of a gift! I have tried getting help to remedy the problem with Philips, but to no avail. Don't waste your money or time on this one!"
4,nice adidas superstar shoe,"much better than my previous sport shoeit feels so comfortable that I wear it not only for basketball game, but also for everyday life"
3,"Looks funny, not for normal wearing","It looks pretty funny when I try to wear them. The color really stands out and the shape of it Im not used to. I guess it only works on certain people. I guess you gotta just used these for basketball.If you ever wear them outside, do not step on mud. There are little gaps in between that looks hard to clean.I got these because it was on sale and they had my size. I probably wont buy these again. If I played alot of basketball I would though"
5,Awesome in concert!,"Jill Phillips, opening for Caedmon's Call, was phenomenal tonight. A voice thats true, and some great guitar-work along with her husband, made her one of the best opening acts I have ever seen! I would have left happy just hearing her play her 4 songs!"
5,A Classic!,"I had been searching to replace a watch I had for a number of years. This watch is classic! Beautifully presented, manufactured with care and a real class act! I can't wait to buy another."
3,the band clasp needs a redisgn,"It's a very nice watch for the money, and I am quite satisfied with it, so far. However, I did find the clasp mechanism on the watch band to be confusing and cumbersome. In fact, while I was trying to work it out, it broke! That's within a few minutes of unpacking the watch and trying it on! So I had to run to the store and buy a new leather band."
4,Stuhrling Gatsby Watch - Rose Gold,"This watch is beautiful. The rose gold color really gives it that authentic vintage look. If I didn't know any better, I'd swear it was made back in the '30's. Only minus is the thickness of the watch, looks a little bulky on the wrist. Luckily my husband is a tall man and can pull it off."
1,run for only 1 week,I bought this stuhrling #144L.3245E2 about two weeks ago. It stopped running after only 1 week. The battery must have run out. I am really DISAPPOINTED and ANGRY. A Swiss Watch could run for only 1 week. I don't want to send it back for guarantee becase why I have to pay 20$ for the shipping? I would never buy stuhrling again!!!
3,Very nice before the washing,The shams looked perfect until they were washed per the instructions. After the wash a seam that had not been sewn correctly had frayed and another small hole that frayed needed to be repaired by some hand sewing.
5,a must read,"I could not put this down. It is a funny, warm, and insightful jam session on the subjects of literature, jazz, and American culture. This is a must have for any student of those subjects. It's also gives fascinating background into the lives and intellectual development of these literary giants."
1,"it's simply a mess, dahlinks.........","i have never seen ,a mess like that , an obese person ,with no knowledge of fitness,trying to make a buck ,selling such rubish,is simply a disgrace to even consider ,doing any of those --so called 'exercises--seeing her lying on the floor ,is like going to an animal auction ,and seeing a poor cow tired after a long day ,in the heat , and a few pounds of feed;lots of them .actually... sell your diamonds ,if you need the cash ...so badly...mama jolie is spinning in her grave, just two words --LUMPY AND DUMPY."
5,"Oh, Brother....Oh, Sister!","I really loved this book. It told me why not to insult or say rude or mean things to my sister, and why to give her compliments and her own personal space. It also made me feel good about having a sibling and gave me some really fun ideas to do with her! I am very glad I have this book. It helped my sister and I ALOT."
4,Great book for my oldest child!,"I was the oldest in my family, so I feel my 8 year old daughter's pain at being the oldest in a large family! I ordered this book for her because she has struggled a bit lately with how to deal with her younger brothers and I trust the American Girl brand.I find her reading it and using tips from it often. She sat down and read the entire thing on the first afternoon she received it! I like that the tone of the book is empathetic, but overall positive and encouraging. I think it has helped her grow in a good way in her relationship with her siblings!"
3,A good read overall,"This book is interesting and I enjoyed reading it. However, the book is more about the life and experiences of the author than about the afterlife. Most of the text is devoted to describing the life experiences of the author. It still makes an interesting read because it does have good and informational references to spirit communication and the afterlife. If you are interested in more direct information about the afterlife then this book comes up short in this area."
1,very poor,I was expecting so much more from this book.There's no substance. No marvel. Just a thinly written biography.To bad. She has contributed so much to the field.
2,The website for the codes is gone!,"Unfortunately, the website mentioned in the book, and the way that you would apply for the prize offered for breaking the code, is gone. I don't understand why this was done, maybe someone won already?Great book otherwise!"
3,Just okay....,"Bought this bag for my SONY DSLR ALPHA 100, the cover isn't padded at all, and the bag isn't as big as I thought it was...It will work for a while with my camera, 18-70, and 75-300 lens, but anything more I'll need something bigger."
2,"the ataris- ""end is forever""","well, i'm going to be seeing this band w/ fsf (the real reason i'm going to the concert)- so, i figured i should probably make an effort to pick up some of their music. i was reccommended 'blue skies, lonely hearts...' but this was what they had. upon my first listen, all i can say is that it is about the most cliched emo record i've ever heard. lets see. frontman with no vocal talent: check. lyrics i could write in my sleep: check. 3 chords: check.this record is laughable. there are a few singable songs- but it's nothing to brag about. the first single off of 'astoria' (""in this diary"") already shows more promise than this entire album. a very dissapointing purchase indeed."
5,good,"the end is forever is a pretty solid album. i especially like the tracks i.o.u. one galaxy, giving up on love, and song #13. the retake on song for a mix tape is also a pleasant surprise. i'd recommend this album for anyone who likes to listen to music. the lyrics will stick in your head and make you appreciate them. the guitars and drums are also sound. just buy this album. it's worth it."
5,End is Forever is the best CD in modern times,"Without even thinking about it, End id Forever is easily my favorite CD and one of the best I have ever heard. Great lyrics and vocals, not to mention killer guitars. What more needs to be said?"
3,Same,"This is definately a good album, but The Ataris need some new ideas. The music is good, and yes more of the same pop punk, but give me some new lyrics. I know you have trouble with girls and love, so don't tell me in every song. This same theme is in many punk albums, so I can't complain too much. I like the music and variation at some points in the album, so pick it up especially if you liked the previous one (or just have your friend buy it)."
2,overrated,"is it just me, or are the ataris totally overrated? i like all the other bands anywhere near this genre, like the starting line, saves the day, something corporate, finch, allister, no use for a name...but it just seems to me like the ataris are a bland, no talent act. I bought blue skies, and the only song i like on that album is ""the last song i will ever write about a girl"" in vain i tried out ""anywhere but here"", but it [was] just as bad. I wasted my time on money on this band, and although everyone raves about them, my advice is to check out ""stay what you are"" or ""leaving through the window"" for some talented musicianship of this style."
4,"Good...not as good as ""Blue Skies""...but still good","When I first gave ""End Is Forever"" a listen I was a little unsure of what to say. Though the album was satisfying it was missing something, then I realized what the problem was. I was expecting another ""Blue Skies, Broken Hearts..."" when I bought it, but I can't say I'm dissapointed. The Ataris did a great job with this album with songs like ""Summer Wind was always our song"", ""up, up, down, down...."" and a few others highlighting the CD. And you can't forget ""Teenage Riot"" which is a very different sounding song for the ataris with a ska kind of feel to it, though it's a great song I hope they don't move towards that direction. Now to finish this off I'll tell you now this is not another ""Blue Skies..."", but it's a great Ataris album. Definetly worth your money."
4,"Almost there, but not quite makin' it","Being a die-hard Ataris fan, I have to say ""End"" doesn't measure up to their prior albums and EPs. It has several good tracks, especially ""Teenage Riot"" and ""Song 13."" But there are also a few nauseatingly cheesy songs, including the ""Time of Your Life"" ..., ""Hello and Goodbye."" Old fans might enjoy this CD for what it is, but newcomers should probably go with ""Blue Skies, Broken Hearts..."" for an idea of what the Ataris are really capable of. To get the full Ataris effect, GO TO A SHOW! They're a lot of fun, always all-ages, and the band is always happy to sign autographs and talk with you."
4,"Sick book! :-)Not as good as 'Black water Born', but close.","Black water Born, which should be out next year is Fara's best book period. But 'That Hurt Thing' is pretty good, don't get me wrong. It scared the heck out of me -- I'll never relax in a funeral home again. That slutty Lyra character is ohhhh...so interesting, and Gerald Ford's crossdressing made me laugh out loud more than once. How Nick got caught up in these types of people is strange, considering all he wants to do is make Chloe realize that he's a good man for her. I won't give away the ending, but you won't see it coming. Just when I believed I had it all together, I found out I'd been tricked the whole way through. Gutsy move! This is one book that will haunt you long afterwards...."
3,For Alvaro Vitali Fans....,"In this sequel to ""Pierino Contro Tutti"" from 1981, the ephemeral class clown 'Pierino' (Alvaro Vitali) was back and up to his old tricks of juvenile pranks/unleashed on a new set of hapless victims. The beautiful Michela Miti was also onboard again, as well as some of the other characters that we have come to love from this series. Some of the jokes and pranks started to get tiresome, but I endured them with pleasure. Keep an eye out for Serena Grandi as 'Rosina', she was credited for a cameo that lasted mere seconds, such a waste! 'Mya' did an excellent job on the restoration and transfer. ""Pierino colpisce ancora"" (""Pierino Strikes Again"") from 1982, for this DVD release - ""Desirable Teacher 2"". NTSC, in 1.85:1 aspect ratio, Italian (mono) with English subtitles, NR 93 mins. Alvaro Vitali fans everywhere will want to own this one too!Love and Peace,Carlos Romero"
4,Great album from Rit and Foster,"Lee Ritenour co-produced this with drummer Harvey Mason (of Fourplay fame) and David Foster both who he had been working with for years. The lead vocalist is Eric Tagg a Dutch vocalist who sang on several of Rit's albums, them became a preacher although he did release an album in 1997. Highlights include ""No Sympathy"" and ""Is It You"" also featuring Bill Champlin on backing vocals. Lee and Harvey wrote the liner notes. Many other fabulous musicians are featured as well."
2,"It works, But No Better Than Any Other Pins","I have no complaints about this product, other than the fact that it is made from rosewood--an endangered rainforest tree. And the pins work no better than plastic pins."
4,a dandy of spy-schtick!,"Very entertaining late 60's Cold war romp through Britain and Germany. Excellent realism (Russian agent heroin user who longs for home simultaneously with the next hit!), Laurence Harvey's cold, matter-of-fact demeanor of the disgruntled agent who is pretty much fed up with the whole political spy scene.Also, Mia Farrow is excellent as the ditzy, naive ""bird"" who takes a fancy to LH's counterpoint character. But the real kudos go to Peter Cook, the mod devil-may-care chap who supplies to LH all the pertinent spy goings-on with a mordant, off-color humorous style. (Note his playboy flirtations juxtaposed with his serious delineations of Home Office tidbits to LH at the penthouse tower bar in Germany.)Quincy Jones gets raves for the soundtrack! Finally, the ending is tastefully done, all too apropos for LH's downwardly spiraling lifestyle."
4,An answer for the beginning...,"I got into the metroid series a bit later on (around the time of Super Metroid). After having playing super metroid, I tried to pick up the original to play it and maybe get some of the storyline bits I might have missed, but I was unable to keep my interest for long because I had been spoiled by super metroid's map feature. This was a great way for me to finally experience the original, and get the storyline in a way that I could handle =) One heck of a remake."
4,I'll take 1!,"Whatever the reason, I can't beat the monster in the end of Fusion that ate my ship. I plan for this game to have monsters that your weapons DO affect. I'd love to be able to beat the game without any invinisble monsters."
4,Metroid Zero Mission? More like HERO MISSION,"So after playing the advance copy that Nintendo sent me, I need to say, this Metroid game is great. The part with the laser beams where the guy shoots and then the aliens all jump back except for the one who gets fried, but then just appears as a burnt-up crisp that runs around; that's the kind of gaming I remember from back in the Intellivision days, where the original Metroid first made its' debut. It's a good thing Nintendo is licensing this from Konami, because they made a mess of the series after their first attempt at a 3-D version on the Genesis. Thank goodness Nintendo decided to take another good property (a 'la Gran Turismo) and turn it around from the train wreck its' original developers have wrought!"
5,samus's first story is a joy,Absolutely loved it I recommend this game to everyone if your a metroid fan or not great gameplay great story my only grip is that its a little to easy and it could have been longer but none the less GET THIS GAME!
4,Fun but short,I found this game really fun for 2 days which i had completed it. this game is a bit to short and a bit easy to get 5 stars. the visual graphics are the usual for the platformers of samus's adventures but the gameplay is diffrenet but still is very good and when they combine it is really good. i would buy this if i had never played a metroid game before. another good game which works well with thia ia metroid fusion although it is older they are basically the same but fusion is much longer. so this game is worth a try if ur new to metroid and veterans borrow it from a mate it is a bit to easy.
4,This game is fun and challanging but could be better,I liked this game and it was long.Here is my viewsGraphics- 10Gameplay- 9.25Storyline-10Overall value- 9.00If your not a big fan rent before buying but if your a big fan buy it no dought about it
4,the best game ever made!,"This game is excellent! There are none of those little problems(e.g., bad graphics, lack of instructions on playing the game, etc...)in this game. I loved the music, the bosses were great, the power up items were nice, in general, the game was perfect."
5,Metroid Zero Mission,"This is he best game ever.There are a lot of hidden stuff and it's hard but not in the bad way. When you finish this game, there is the Original Metroid game included!I beg you to buy this,you will be satisfied!"
4,"A technically good game, but boring","I started with the metroid prime series, which I never got half way through on each one. I wanted to try this one, and I got bored quickly. I put it down because I actually got stuck in a place and I couldn't get out. I dont like the way the way you have to hunt for everything. A little is fine, but some places, you have no idea. All in all, the game is good and technically well done, but it's not my cup of tea."
5,Perfect for the old school fan!,"I am an old school game fan and Metroid was my second favorite growing up, this version is sweet! It has the same format and object with some nice graphics and world updates! And of course if you beat it you can play the original!! Nice!"
2,2 1/2 stars -- not what it could have been,"I picked up Shark Mutiny at a used-book fundraiser for the local library without having ever read anything from Patrick Robinson. This book was far from spectacular but also not as bad as many of the reader reviews would have had me believe. The plot itself had definite promise, although some of the potential was left unfulfilled as plot lines were left hanging. Action sequences kept me turning the pages. All things considered, there were enough positives in Shark Mutiny to make me take a chance on some of Robinson's other works. Hopefully some of the shortcomings will be less evident."
2,Forgotten Assets,"This is the latest in a line of naval thrillers/techno combat books by Robinson, and for me, the least appealing. In the past I could count on Mr. Robinson to at least study every angle of the problems he presents, and then give a plausable reason why something a knowledgable reader would expect to be done, couldn't be done. Not here.Without giving away the storyline, there are innumerable military assets of both the US, Japan and Great Britian available today (and in 2007?)to address the ""island question"" in the story.This is a gaping hole both militarily and politically for Robinson, and one can only guess that he intends to use the ""island question"" in a later book and it is necessary for him to ignore military and political reality to achieve that goal."
3,"More adventure, less politics.",I wish Patrick would have kept his personal political interests out of the book. To place Sen. Kennedy so highly for no reason at all other than to promote one political party. Shame on you Patrick. Keep to what you are pretty good at and that is spinning a decent yarn.
1,"A Weak Ending ""Seals"" It","Ok, enough already...Mr. Robinson has basically rerun all his previous novels in this one. You have China take over Taiwan with no resolution and not even a peep from the USA; the court martial at the end is interesting but crammed into twenty pages;and the racist slurs against the Chinese get real old. The book starts out well, with the potential of two major plot lines, the blocking of the Straits of Hormuz and the takeover of Taiwan. And does anyone really believe blowing up an electrial generator in Burma is payback for China taking over Taiwan?Time for a new plot-line, and a new enemy. The slurs in this book are as bad as it gets."
2,The Shark Munity,"When I pick up this book, I was hoping to read some non-stop action as it was in his last 4 books. I was deeply disappointed in it. The action was so so at best and the court-martial was weak. I would not waste time on this book, hopefully the next one will be better."
2,Disappointed.......,I had anxiously waited for this book to become available. I looked forward to a great action story with political implications. The first 2/3's of the book met my expectations.The Chinese/Iranian alliance was interesting. A stronger President would have been more work too develop but certainly more enjoyable & realistic. SEALS deserve respect and admiration.What is amazing is that a serious invasion occurs and the reader is left with no resolution save a paragraph or two. The mutiny seems forced into the book.....almost like reading two novels in one. The significant events in this one seemed forced together. I was thoroughly enjoying this book until the mutiny....and the rush to wrap-up the story lines.Will not be as anxious for the next one.
2,"Poorly Researched, rushed ending....","This was my first Robinson book and might be my last. The fact it was poorly researched greatly detracted from what could have been a compelling story line. For instance, only Congress can award a Medal of Honor, not a commander. And Merseault wines don't come from the Loire Valley, they come from Burgundy (okay, that might be a little picky on my part). It also seems that after the main build up in the book he quickly rushed to wrap it up. Any further character or plot development was dispenced with in the name of brevity."
1,Unrealistic Techno-thriller Trash,"This book is a poor imitation of early Tom Clancy, ala The Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising, etc. The plot is ridiculous, and the dialogue and characterization is pretty silly.The author seems to think that the fate of the world depends upon two 12 man SEAL teams, and that the lack of a single carrier battle group would allow the PRC to make a major invasion. He conveniently forgets about the Marines deployed in Okinawa, Army and Air Force in Korea and Japan, other units in CONUS, etc.In his world, all US military policy and strategy is devised and controlled by a cranky National Security Advisor, who is a former Navy Admiral, who likes to yell orders across the office at his secretary/fiance, who won't marry him until he retires. How cute.I read this in a single sitting, while stuck on a long airplane flight. After I finished, my thought was ""Wow, what a waste!"""
1,Teddy Kennedy,"On Page 11 of ""The Shark Mutiny"" (soft cover) Robinson describes Kennedy thusly: ""..the vastly experienced Senator Ted Kennedy, whose unwavering patriotism and endless concern for his country made him always a natural leader among such men.""""Such men"" in this book are the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the CNO, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the ""Defense Secretary"" (as Robinson calls the position), and various NSC members.Oh really. It's evident Robinson's home in Cape Cod plays a role in his beatification of Chappaquidick Teddy who obviously, among his many fears, hates being in the water. And this is a book about watermen.No, I truly doubt the above-mentioned military men hold Kennedy in the esteem Robinson does. Just the opposite, I'll bet.Once I saw that passage, I threw the book away since it was apparent other passages would lead to further preposterous observations.Mark Berent"
1,Where's the Air Force?,"The invasion of Taiwan is a hoot. Even if the U.S. Navy was unable to support the island, where is the Air Force? The author goes in to great detail about the beach landings, capture of ports and cities. But, he knows nothing about how the U.S. could / would respond with forces other than the Navy.For example, The US would have the option to outfit B1, B2 and B52 bombers with air to surface Harpoons. One or two good long range raids would have broken the back of the invading navy. Also, where are the US Subs? There would be subs deployed in the area outside of the Carrier battle groups. And the US could have reinforced the Tia airforce with pilots and replacement aircraft.Finally when does a LT in Navy Intel at NSA report directly to an ADM? What an insult to the intelligence of the informed reader."
2,Shark Mutiny,"I really like this author but for his latest 2 books, Unseen and Shark Mutiny, I was very disappoointed in how he resolves the conflict. I probably will not read any more by him. the writing is great, as is the story -- I just did NOT like how he chose to end either one. And -- I cannot find any way to contact him from his website."
1,Worst Novel Ever!,"If I could assign negative stars I would do so. This novel is trite, predictable, and poorly written. The British author has no ear for US dialogue. His characterizations are cliches. Save your money. Do not buy this terrible book."
3,Unrealistic!,"I was mildly entertained reading the book, but the number one problem I have with the story is that mutiny on one sub is the biggest news story, never mind the fact that China invaded Taiwan. If that actually happened, mutiny on a sub would be about number 99 on the list.Next, I think, I hope that the our American military is not stupid enough to leave Taiwan unprotected, and if we did, we certainly would not allow China to get away with the attack, just blowing up one measley Naval base as punishment. And why, after China attacks Taiwan, couldn't we have just taken out the base using air strikes rather than sneaking in there with SEALS and trying to keep it a secret?By the time I finished the book, I was very disappointed. This was the first and last book I will read by this author."
4,"Good Books, but......","Ok, this book attracted my mainly because I found lots of 'character' in USS. Seawolf is featured, I start to wonder with this new book of Mr. Robinson will some things that not cleared in USS. Seawolf will finally concluded here. But it's not.... I'm quite dissapointed.But.. after reading the book, I found now we have a balanced rivalry. United States is super power against other nation like China and Iran. But with the right tactic, we can see that Giants can also be defeated well.. distracted at least. I have to give 2 thumbs up for the strategy of the Chinese side.I wonder, why the title is Shark Mutiny although the Mutiny incident happen in a fast pace and (IF) the incident being erased from the book, I really find the book with a good finishing of course will do much better.. kinda remind me of reading some no-exact-main charcter work such as Red Storm Rising.By that... I have to give 4 stars out of 5....."
1,Virtually unreadable,"Sorry, but I have to say that I made it about halfway through this book before I literally couldn't read another page. I tried to finish it, but it just didn't work. The dialogue is forced and unpolished, the plot is reaching beyond the realms of reasonable suspension of disbelief and none of the characters seem to make any decisions which are logically thought out. Pick another book."
2,Nothing new and nothing special,"I thought it could not get any worse then the last book and while it hasn't, this one is not any better either.The author loves SEALs to a rather uncomfortable degree and his lead characters share an extreme right wing, almost racist view about almost anyone who is not in the US military. Perhaps you could forgive this if the plot and the writing were of a high standard but they aint!I have a real fear that this reads like the first of a two part book, many things are left unresolved (like the Chinese take over of Taiwan) and there may be more to come. There are much better things to read then this, don't waste your money.Personally I think Mr Robinson should change tack and perhaps his passion for the SEALs should be undertaken alone while reading Soldier Of Fortune in the bath and not inflicted on the rest of us!"
1,"Naval ""technothriller"" from the knowledge of a grocery night","Tom Clancys books were great because when they did deviate from plot to focus on technical military insights, they were correct, interesting to those in the military as to how detailed his information was, and informative to the general public. This cheap british knock off author held his own in the first two books by writing about britain as much as possible, and probably had some great coauthoring. Since then his plots have devolved, his characters never evolve, and continue to be trite stereotypes of american regions (not all Kansans are ranchers, nor all new englanders lobster fisherman) and also misses the most obvious details of military protocol and technology, the public is best served by treating every detail in his books as fanciful fiction (just like all of those of us serving on submarines know it to be) Hopefully his publisher will stop promoting and printing this trite ... and find a new author to spend their efforts on."
3,shark mutiny,not mine belongs to ex but has to leave certain amount of comments for sub mit button to lite up
1,KATHY !.....,"Even more tedious than the rambling diatribes concerning Admiral Morgan and the ""red headed"" beauty were the lengthy homo-erotic soliloquies on the subject of the bravado and manliness of Navy SEALS.After completing this novel my greatest concern was the amount of effort required to dispose of it."
1,Don't buy this book!,"I only read a few books per year and, for whatever reason, decided to make this the first of the year. What a waste of time! After reading roughly 350 pages of the 400+ page book I put it down. I had had enough!I kept asking myself, ""How did the author/character come to that conclusion?"", ""Why in the world would the character do that?"", ""China attacks Taiwan to get their art back?"", ""WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE THINKING??"" Surely Richardson would explain in a wonderful denoument (-sp), but nooooo. Perhaps I gave up too soon, but I doubt it. I simply think this novel is just that bad."
3,Ever hear of the Air Force?,"Shark Mutiny is an entertaining book, as long as you don't let yourself be bothered by numerous typographical errors, choppy editing, and an unbelievable plot. Although I am not familiar enough with Naval operations to know how accurately he portrays them, I do know that if China invaded Taiwan, it would take far more than a crippled carrier and over-extended Navy fleet to prevent any U.S. involvement at all!! Geez - hasn't this guy ever heard of the U.S. Air Force? Not once is any service other than the U.S. Navy ever mentioned, which goes to show that he has a basic misunderstanding of how we fight. (hint - we fight as a joint force, with Navy-only operations increasingly rare).Despite these serious shortcomings, Shark Mutiny is entertaining and a quick read. Just don't try mislead yourself into thinking that you're getting any insight into how things are really done in the U.S. military."
1,Don't bother,"What are the chances that you can find an author AND an editor who see fit to move the White House from 1600 to 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue in the second paragraph of the first chapter? And the book goes downhill after that! The plot is so unbelievable as to strain credulity. Immediately after he moves the White House two blocks, the author has a four-star general involved romantically with an enlisted member of the Navy! Ludicrous. A lieutenant JG might do something that dumb, but a full admiral?"
1,Sharks vs Seals,"The title of this book bears no resemblence to the actual story.After listening to Kilo class on tape, I thought I would enjoy another novel by Robinson. I was wrong. The story is not logical, the political content is very one sided, and the story line stretches the border of reason.The ending of this book would cause a mutiny by anyone currently involved with the military.This is one book that does not deserve to be read."
1,Garbage,Patrick Robinson has really dredged the depths. He repeats his court martial scenerio of a single submarine (remember the president's son in previous books) as the climax of a plot that has china invading taiwan - give me a break! Poorly researched (Qantas is NOT spelt Quantas) and an insult to Australians (we do not say cobber all of the time) Definately the last time I will waste my time on this author
1,Gene,"Wow! This book is a stinker! How did this get published? The plot is silly. The writer doesn't know anything about the U.S. military. And, he has this fixation on the Navy Seals -- unhealthy, filled with Seal recruiting poster stuff. Yo! Today's U.S. military also has long-range planes, missiles, fast deploying Army troops, and doesn't take orders from the National Security Advisor. But, his story forgets about these logical responses to story situations. The behavior and criminal stupidity of the author's protagonists insults all vets. These characters would have been fragged."
3,Locking gas cap,"I gave this three stars based on my last Stant gas cap. It's plastic, with an inexpensive cylinder lock. There isn't anything special about it. My fist one was a Mopar branded Stant. The second was an actual Stant, and now I'm on my third. They're on my 2005 Dodge Ram 2500 with a 5.9L Cummins.They only last a few years. Then, the cold, wet, salty winters take their toll on the locking mechanism. They freeze up, and get bound. I've tried WD-40, liquid graphite lock lubricant, and various lock de-icers. The worst part is when I have to get it off, it isn't that difficult to use a similarly shaped key with the same grooves in it to force the tumblers to give way... which is why I end up buying a new one. Until something better comes about, they're better than non-locking caps.The good thing is that this cost me half of what Advanced Auto Parts wanted, not including my state's sales tax."
3,its a gas cap,"Does the job, value is great, serves as a deterrant to thieves. Only complaint is the key insertion is tight/awkward/unlubricated. You won't be dissappointed."
2,"This cap, #10508, did not work for me","The cap worked very well, however, it came with only ONE key. With three drivers in our home, I needed 2 more keys. First I tried all the local hardware stores and none of them had the blank. They noted that it was an unusual 2 sides key, and that I should check with a locksmith. They all said they could make a one sided key and that those blanks were common. Each one had their favorite locksmith, and I saw every one. They could not help me because of, ""NO BLANK"". Each one said that they come from China, and they don't want to pay for American blanks, so they use their own. Stant could not help me, nor could the supplier, Great Lakes Wholesalers. I had to return your cap and buy one from Pep Boys."
4,for caravan van,"I have two caravan vans, bought one gas cap to see it it would work. The keys seem a little flimsy, but the gas station operator said they do not break until they get rusty. Its a little fiddly, but I fiqured it out. what happens when gas theives get master keys?"
1,Pass,Really crappy product. Entire locking mechanism comes out at times. Doesn't really lock most times and the service engine light comes on when using this cap. Anybody know of a good locking cap?
2,Did not work,"This cap did not work for me. It locked, but it caused my check engine light to keep coming on because it would not make a good tight seal!"
1,Locking Gas cap,"Would not lock, requested a replacement but was informed that it was placed on back order, so I canceled the order."
1,LOcking Gas Cap,"The keys with the cap do not fit the cap. I have emailed Amazon 2 times and sent a letter asking for return instructions but have received no response from Amazon. Order ID 1-73418. Please, Please respond."
1,Mr.,"Stant 10508 locking fueling cap.Twice Amazon sent me the wrong item and twice I returned it. When I canceled the order, Amazon kept $5 postal charge. It is ugly and dishonest. Shame on Amazon."
2,Stant Locking Gas Cap,The key is aluminium and broke on the first useage. In the picture it appears to be brass and we certainly would not buy again!
4,"Updated: Now it locks again, maybe it was me.","When I first bought this, it locked great and worked great. No check engine lights. Then it stopped working, so I updated my review. However, I went out and played with it and now it locks again. It honestly may have been me. LOL. SUGGESTIONS: They should have a list of what models\caps work together to make it easier and offer some simple instructions For example, once you lock the gas tank once, you do not have t lock it again, just unlock it. What I mean by that is, when you replace the cap, just turn it until it starts CLICKING, which means it's locked. You DO NOT have to use a key, that only unlocks it. I guess the gist of it is that it may even already come locked."
3,fits a 2012 Nissan Frontier,"This cap does not fit a 2012 frontier unless you modify it and the maker does not say that it does, I just happen to see it in another review that it would fit but it didn't mention anything about modifying it to fit the 2012 Frontier. It will fit by cutting the two triangles tabs at the end of the threads so that it ends as a normal thread so it will screw into your tank.I did so with a razor utility knife.This worked for me.---Well its been 3-4 days since the last review and the bad news is the engine light came on which means the new gas cap with my modifications does not work properly so I reinstalled my non locking stock gas cap and light is now out...do not use for 2012 frontier will not work."
4,fuel cap,"I received the fuel cap pretty fast I got it for my 2010 dodge ram and it fit wellonly thing that was weird at first, was when I had just opened the box and turned the key a few times the silver thing that the key goes into came out I thought I had broken it, but turns out I just had to put it back in to the cap and turn the key and it just snapped into place.I then went to try it on the truck and so far so good"
1,07 dodge- doesn't work,"Purchased 2 for 07 dodge Magnum and 1/2 ton dodge. It kept popping off. I would press as hard as I could and get it on the tank, and then, when I pulled just as hard, I could pop it off.Gave them to Goodwill.Going to spend a little more and go to the dodge house and get factory one."
4,2012 review,I bought this for my dodge caliber 2010 sxt. Been using it almost a year not and its stopped gas thiefs that I actually caught trying to steal my gas at 5am before work! They ran off and I still had a full tank of gas. It is a pain to use the key each fill up but has saved me money!
1,What happens when gas thieves get master keys?,"Fair question. The answer is, if they can't get into your tank the 'normal' way, they just punch a hole in your tank with a screwdriver, or cut the rubber hose part of your filler tube. Think locking caps are expensive? - Try pricing a new tank or filler system! IMHO, all the locking caps do is serve to keep 'honest' people 'honest'."
3,mounting drawer slides,"The unit is very sturdy with strong magnets. You have to make sure the slide is inserted correctly. The markings made for slides should be reviewed with a square to make sure they are level, as the clamping action is not too accurate. Any deviation right to left slide will interfere with drawer action. With that exception the slide holding is really helpful."
5,works GREAT,"This tool is easy to understand and use, with common sense it makes drawer guides easy! Jeff Baribeau Carpentry"
2,mounting tool,didn't work well w/ installing the drawer slides for dresser I had to replace. I had to rig up several clamps and it still wasn't accurate or helpful in making installation easier
5,Kreg,For installing the Blum style drawer slides it makes the job easier and takes the guess work out of placement
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Save your money and your time. Make a story stick and use that instead, in the long run you'll be done quicker with a lot less frustration AND you'll have an extra 30 bucks in your pocket to spend on making the wife happy."
4,Kreg NZ03 Magnetic Drawer Slide Mounting Tool,"Another helpful tool from Kreg. Upon opening the box, I was skeptical that the little magnetic insert would hold the slides adequately, but apparently size isn't everything. The jig grabs the slide securely and the blue plastic can be penciled for any needed backset. The jig holds Liberty, Blum, and brandX slides without any adjustment. The only improvement I'd suggest is a speed clamp area, to add a level of stability and avoid the three hand issue. After mounting 15 ""euro"" drawer slide sets of varying depths, it saved a lot of frustration and time. Well worth the twenty bucks!"
5,Magnetic drawer slide mounting tool.,"After a lenghty and error prone attempt at mounting bottom mount drawer slides,took the project to school where the instructor introduced me to the Kreg mounting tool. What a piece of cake,important as I am in the process of building four credenzas, involving 16 drawers. Have the mounting brackets on order. Thank you. Bob Mishica"
5,Nice,"Another good Kreg fixture, A magnet holds the slide and you clamp the jig to the cabinet face frame. Keeps the slide nice and level. I found it easy to use."
3,It's nothing like the first release!,"I was utterly disappointed to find out that this new release didn't sound like the first one. The dreamy atmospehere which was created by his first release fades away in this release. It also uses quite a bit of cussing, which I am not a fan of. It's just not the same, wasn't it for his great voice. Where did the slight trance influence go? There are maybe one or two good songs on this cd. Don't expect too much!"
3,This book is a good reference for the beginner.,"I found the book to be well written and illustrated. The advice and techniques presented are sound, though somewhat over-simplified. It would be excellent reading for those who are considering a tractor restoration project. Those who have completed one or more restorations should find it interesting, but not enlightening."
2,get the original version by House of Prince instead,"Honestly, if you already have the 2-disc reissue of the Offer Nissim CD, ""Second Time,"" and if you aren't a Nissim remix completist, you have all you need of this rerecording of the 1997 classic, a much more aggressive and sexy version than this. The vocals sound pretty much the same as the original version, but the mixes just can't compare, especially considering this dark tribal house sound is getting REALLY dated... Plus, if you have the reissue of the Nissim CD, you already have the full vocal version of ""Be My Boyfriend"" as well. Having said that, I must say, my favorite remix is the the ""Perfect Club mix"" with its moody string-synths. So then, well, heck, maybe you should pick this up after all. But just don't expect a series of great remixes. And DO get your hands on the original CD single by House of Prince..."
4,Soft but not squishy...,"This album shows off the exquisite six-part harmonies and instrumental versatility of the group, and it features two of their biggest hits. They may have been pioneers for the ""soft rock"" sound of the 1970's, but they were willing and capable of playing any style they wished as shown on the bluesy ""Reputation"" or the psychedelic leanings on a couple of other tracks. This is probably their best album overall, so I would recommend it to anyone wishing to dig a little deeper than their hit singles."
5,A Must Have For All Metallica Fans,If there is anything you ever wanted to know about the band Metallica you can get it all right here from this book...It is the first book i have ever been able to read all the way through without getting bored...From the first days of Kill Em All all the way through it doesn't miss a beat!
3,a good bio but with errors,This was a pretty good bio but there were a lot of errors in it and it's a bit surprising that the publisher didn't proof it better as some were obvious like having Lars and James living in two cities at the same time (one that doesn't even exist. The author wrote in one paragraph it was La Brea but got it right in the next with Brea). Lars must have been really rich back in the balony sandwich days to afford to live in both Newport Beach and Huntington Beach! And those cities are in Orange County (as is Anaheim) not Los Angeles despite what the owner of a certain baseball team wants you to believe. The author's passion for the band came through and this is well worth reading but beware the errors (there are far more than the simple geographic ones I pointed out above).
5,a great book for any metallica fan,"this book is excellent i bought it because of all the great pictures ,and then when i started to read it i couldn't put it down.Also lots of information that even the biggest metalli-fan wouldn't know."
4,METAL UP YOUR A$$,"THIS IS A WORTHY BOOK BOUT METALLICA BUT NOT THE BEST, BUT THE PICS ARE THE BEST...LOTS OF CLIFF, THIS BOOK IS LIKE...PRETTY AND BIG, A COLLECTORS MORE THAN A READER'S"
2,WEIRD...,"I dont'have to do anyhting a all with this once great band, that astonished the world by completely sold out to commercial approachs. They sucumbed to unbeliavable arrogance, released some of the worst garbages on metal ( listen to the new covers in ""GARAGE INC""... ) All in all, this book is only for two people: ex-Metallica fans like myself who seek an explanation for the virtual ending of this band or actual fans who swallow anything they throw into the market."
3,Decent...But I finished wanting more,"As any die-hard Metallica fan, its GREAT to see the unpublished color photos and quotes from the band members...But there is just not enough information on the touring side of the band and life before they teamed up together. The parts on the death of Cliff Burton, and Jason first joining Metallica were not discussed in detail as I would have liked. But, still...A good book, just not enough detail. Check out METALLICA: THE FRAYED ENDS OF METAL for MORE information. That was a MUCH better book, although not as nicely put together as this one."
3,A Long Read,"This was an interesting book! Siberia strikes me as a much more friendly and beautiful place to visit than I formerly believed. The author's side trips by boat and bus and train are very descriptive and entertaining but he seems to meet quite a few depressing people! I found the book to be a ""slow"" read, the kind of book you can put down and don't rush back to continue, though you do want to know how it ends.Also, the end wasn't satisfying to my taste. The author could have written a summary of his feelings about the trip and the people and thrown out a bit of hope for this economically ravaged land!I recommend this book for the fascinating travel narratives but add an asterisk to prepare for the emotional rollercoaster one experiences from the interactions with the inhabitants of that region!!"
3,Through the cold lens,"A very sweeping read about the mass of land little explored in the Western press. Language very rich though taxing. The writer is clearly an ex British private school boy, who still sees this part of the world through the unsympathetic prism of the old Cold War enemy."
5,Beautiful--every sentence a poetic observation of Russia!,"If you love Russia, or anything about Siberia you will love and cherish this book! Thubron writes with a Byronic majesty but in such a down-to-earth fashion. He draws the reader right into his travels and conversations with Siberian natives. A truly awesome book!"
4,I would also recommend...,"I thought that the depiction of Siberia was magical, and would certainly recommend this book to those that have not read it yet. For those who have, and are interested in more about this land, I would recommend Tent Life in Siberia: An Incredible Account of Siberian Adventure, Travel, and Survival."
1,Not very user friendly,"I ordered this to remove nails from my deck. It is only effective if the nail head is slightly raised, otherwise you have to hammer quite a bit to get it to grasp the nail. Also, the end where you hammer cracked and a piece broke off within the first hour of use. If I could get it around the nail head it was very good at pulling the nail, but it was a lot of effort to get it around the head. I found it easier to remove the boards, turn them over, pound the nail through then remove it with the claw on my hammer."
5,Can You LIVE Without It ??,"Drive a 16d with an air powered framing nailer. If you don't like it, pull it right out with this. Any other bar or pliers will make a big old mess on your material. The way an air nailer countersinks a nail, you have to get below the surface of the wood. This tool does that, with a lift of the handle, then a firm slam down. Then when you rock it back onto the foot, the nail is pinched tighter than any thing else can pinch without cutting the nail. Keep a steady pull on the handle and the nail WILL come out. Amazing. Old ideas are still sometimes the best ideas."
2,Poor quality,"This came very highly regarded by professional carpenters. Unfortunately I think they had used the US made version. That's the only explannation I can figure for my experience verses theirs.It was awkward to use. I thought it would save my back, but it still requires bending over while positioning the jaws over the nail head. But the bottom line is that it started to break after just eight nails!The good news is that the Amazon Marketplace vendor refunded my money quickly without a hassle. I applaud them for good customer service."
5,Designed more than 50 years ago and still the best,I've been using this nail puller to remove cedar siding from my home. I plan to turn it over and reuse it so minimal damage is key for me. This is the only tool I know that can do the job. The only damage left is a small rectangle dent around the nail head where the tool grabs the nail. It grabs with a few slams of the sliding hammer and the nails easily come out. If you're removing lots of nails this is a great tool. If your looking for minimal damage to the wood this is the only tool I know of that can do the job.
4,Gift for Husband,Both my dad and my husband have used the new nail puller. It works best with long nails that need to be pulled; danger of pinching one's finger if the nail is too short.
1,Lemon or Taiwanese crap steel?,"The site info doesn't tell you it's 'made in Taiwan', well-known for its low grade steel. I was doubtful when we started (recalled my dad's US made one from the 1940's worked well after 40 years). It pulled nails well, but ... Sure enough, after we pulled perhaps 250 deck nails, the bottom lever snapped: perhaps a fluke, but likely crap Taiwanese steel. I'm ordering a replacement, hoping it was just a fluke. Amazon needs to avoid selling any Taiwan-made tools unless they're sure of the material quality. Otherwise trust will evaporate, particularly when they don't state where products are made."
5,Great tool,"Got this for boyfriend who uses vintage wood, to recycle the wood into new furniture. He said it was like the one he used on his uncle's farm when he was a kid. So like some of the other reviews, this is a great tool."
3,"Works, but not very durable","I used this to pull about 500 nails while re-doing my deck. It is easy to use:1) Place fixed curved tooth next to nail and hold tool at about a 30 degree angle.2) Strike with hammer while pulling tool to vertical. Teeth close under nail head.3) Extend handle for leverage and pull nail out.Two problems:1) No instructions (might be like asking for instructions on a hammer but it wasn't obvious to me).2) Top of tool (where I struck with hammer) disintegrated as the project progressed. This was either due to poor manufacturing or improper use. Perhaps it is not designed to be struck with a hammer?It did the job, but it wouldn't last for two decks of nails."
2,disappointment,when i first got this tool i was very impressed but since i have been using it i have noticed that its very difficult to remove nails from boards that are unsecured to a structure also its very heavy
1,Paul Bunyan Tool,"This tool is bulky, cumbersome and not ergo-friendly. Ladies this is a real ""man-tool"". Heavy and requires space, strength and experience to use. Not the best choice I have ever made."
1,Great shopping,"I bought this cart and register for my [...] year old daughter for Christmas. She just loves it! She likes to set up the ""groceries"" around the house and then take her shopping cart or basket around to pick out her groceries. She likes to talk on the cash register's microphone and loves that the scanner really beeps. The register is kind of small and the billed money has to be folded to fit in the drawer, but otherwise we were very pleased. She can play for hours!"
3,"Great album, but censored.","This album is a great Cutty Ranks album mostly because 20 Inch is a great song, but this is the censored version of the album which makes lisening to the song 20 Inch a bit boring. I gave it a 3 star, because it is the censored version of the album. All the other songs are top class."
2,This stuff just ripped my soft contact lens,"I used to use Bausch and Lomb saline solution but I switched to this stuff because I got it in the mail for free and I am also using Clear Care by Ciba Vision. Well, I was just cleaning my contacts with the saline solution and about to put them in the case when I noticed one had ripped while I was cleaning it. I blame the saline solution because I don't have long nails and this was a NEW pair of contacts I put in my eyes (had started on Sept. 10th.) It is now Sept. 24th. When I was using Bausch and Lomb my contacts never ripped. Looks like I am going back to Bausch and Lomb. Don't use Ciba Vision Softwear Saline solution."
5,Great look at life in the Minor Leagues!,"Hank Davis has done a marvelous job in this view of life in (and around) the minor leagues. His sense of humor comes through many times. This was probably the easiest reading book of this length (354 pages)that I've encountered. It just flows! One of the things that I liked most about the book was not only the liberal use of photographs, but their placement. Every photo was within a page of the corresponding verbage. In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Each and every page was interesting, entertaining, or informative. As a visitor to approximately 30 minor league parks myself, Davis enabled me to ""revisit"" many of those parks. Job well done, Mr. Davis!"
3,"Good, but Already Quite Dated","I really enjoyed the premise of ""Small-Town Heroes."" The problem is a book like this--which focuses heavily on the constant changes in minor league baseball--is subject to that change and as such, feels very dated. I loved the idea of traveling around and meeting minor league players and chronicling minor league teams, unfortunately by the time the book got to my hands most of the players mentioned in the book had already washed out of baseball and many of the teams had been disbanded, moved or rebranded. I loved the writing and I loved the initial plan, I just feel a book so focused on the turnover of the game of baseball was doomed to suffer from the same fate."
4,Color wrong,"I have had this set for several years and they have been great. I do want to warn anyone that is as picky as I am that the color is much brighter in the picture than what they really are. They are a softer color, which I think looks better in real life than how it appears in the picture. The mug is more like a light country blue and the rest of the design follows suit."
4,Great kitchenware,"I'm very happy with these dishes, as I knew I'd be. Easy to handle, easy to wash, easy to store.I give 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons: 1) The color is a bit softer than I was expecting; and 2) I would much rather have Corelle-material cups than the earthenware cups that the company now uses. It's a shame that the cups can't be made from the same light-weight, durable material that the dishes are made from. Oh well. This won't stop me from ordering a second pattern soon."
4,corelle livingware,"Delivered as hoped. The dishes are as expected with bowls and salad plates. The mugs were much paler in color than depicted(baby blue not the much darker color in the picture). We didn't know what to expect with the mugs, they came in earthware and seem to have the right feel and weight for coffee mugs. I ordered two sets and then a third after realizing a greater need. The first two sets came intact and will be all that we wished for."
4,cool design ridiculous price,"very soothing cool colors & attractve design. simply love it ! they should add 8.5"" plates for this price, which is higher than retailer.wish they have same material & designed mugs which they used to provide before. stoneware muges are nice but not chip resistance like previous ones. its ever changing prices is a big disappointment.mostly increasing everytime which is not expected from a wholesaler like Amazon while retailers selling for less.( less than $ 27) that sux ! i definitely expect better bargain from Amazon."
4,Never ceases to amaze,"I'm currently reading the book. It's good so far, but a lot WAS left out b-c it's only from Augustus' point of view. A lot of good stuff is missing. It's interesting seeing things from Augustus' view. It's good and I am able to understand better what Augustus means b-c I watched all 6 seasons."
2,Spotty and unfocused series of essays and memories,"Very spotty. Some good pieces in here that offer nice anecdotes and wisdom, and a LOT of worthless filler that offers pretty much nothing. Doesn't offer near the level of insight I had hoped for and expected, and was even pretty boring for gossip. With the exception of six or seven excellent essay, it's a bunch of writers who repeat the same story over and over again: ""I used to not get a lot of writing work, then a friend helped get me a job, and now I write a lot.""Yawn. Save your money."
4,I found myself challenged,"""The Famished Road"" challenged my concepts of narrative and genre and in the perplexity (out there at the edge of chaos where all art and learning takes place) I found myself enchanted and bewitched. I've since seen the label ""magical realism"" attached to Okri's work and suspect that comes from people who live in a linear paradigm, a secular one.The road is hot and dry. The smells of cooking waft from the doorways. A possessed father, a depressed mother, a bar full of dreams and a political tide... This book is special. Prepare for the magic."
4,"""The Ghosts of Post-Colonial Africa""","Spirits abound in Ben Okri's FAMISHED ROAD. Azaro, a young boy growing up in an unnamed African country enduring the throes of its pending independence, sees spirit forms all around him. Azaro lives in the interspaces between the living and the dead, which makes him prone to the attacks of supernatural creatures and the dark machinations of witches and necromancers. Okri provides such detailed depictions of Azaro's out of body experiences, relating them with so much hallucinogenic clarity and intensity that unwary readers will find certain passages disorienting. Heady, trippy stuff but well worth the expenditure of time and concentration. Magical realism at its very best.(Winner of the 1991 Booker Prize for Literature)"
1,Quality not as important as profits,"Wow, Hanes t-shirts have really gone down hill. I had some 4 year old shirts I thought I'd turn into rag after these showed up. What a mistake!Hanes has started to use inferior quality material, the result is excessive shrinkage.Wash them after every use and they will soon be a halter top. What a joke.I see that other brands have started to advertise ""generous length"" as if it was just recently discovered that people want a shirt to fit after you wash it.What a joke, Hanes you have lost me as a customer for good. Especially when you put out crap that's pretty much useless after 5 or 6 washes."
2,Very thin and the neck stretches instantly,"I was a bit disappointed when I got these shirts. I had hoped it would look like in the image, but when I put it on, the first thing i notice is that the shirt is incredibly thin, and the neck stretched out of shape just putting it over my head. Very disappointed. :(This is not the Hanes I remember from 20 years ago."
2,Not good enough,"The product out of the package looked good, not overly long, but after washing and drying on low heat they shrunk to much to be worn. I would not recommend them."
2,These shrink a ton!,"I have been trying to find undershirts that remain tucked in when I bought these. I've had issues with Calvin Klein and others shrinking until they are barely waste long.These measured 28"" from shoulder to waist when I opened to package and less than 25.5"" after washing. Too short for a 5'11"" man."
2,neck not tight,I purchased this brand of tshirt because I read some reviews that said the neckline stays tight and does not stretch out. I tottally disagree. I washed them when I received and tried one on and the neck was loose and hanging immediately.
1,very disappointed in service,"I ordered the XXXL tall and only received the XXXL. I completed an inquiry on how to return and have yet to hear back from any customer service agent. I am extremely disappointed in Amazon's service. In the same order, I ordered several items for Christmas, 3 of which were never even shipped out. I have had to contact Amazon several times in regards to the incomplete order. I am considering not ordering from Amazon again. I hope to have this resolved soon."
2,Under shirt,I have worn the T shirts twice and the neck is already stretched out. These shirts might be the worst under shirts ever.
2,Not all were the same size,"In a package of 3 shirts all should have been X-Large, label on each said so but one fits like a Large and one other is not full length. Like x-out golf balls, this package must have been x-out sizes. No happy."
2,Shrunk after washing,"Good and comfortable shirt, but they shrunk after washing about 2"" inches which pissed me off. I paid $25 for nothing :\"
2,Water + Hanes = Shrinkage,"I really wanted to like these undershirts. I purchased a size based on their charts and (before washing) really enjoyed the shirts. Very breathable, long enough to tuck in my pants, etc. BUT after one wash these shirts have shrunk to a fraction of their original size. Now they are tight in my armpits, the sleeves have run up so much they are barely nonexistent, and my (once wonderful) shirt that tucked comfortably into my pants now hangs uncomfortably above my waist. These were advertised as pre-washed and therefore pre-shrunk, but I just can't believe it. So now I'm $30 bucks out and will have to replace my undershirts."
2,Buy 2 Sizes Larger or Buy a Different T,"These are the strangest white T's I've ever owned. The first time I wore them without an initial wash they were incredibly long and big. I bought a Medium, which is my size in all shirts. However, the shirts were huge and hung out from any shirt I wore over them. So I decided to wash and dry them. Big mistake I guess. The shirts lost around 40% of their size. They don't extend past my navel now when before the dry they were nearly half way down my thigh. It was incredibly strange and they are now unusable. Also, the shirt feel rough and not as high quality as the new ""lay flat color"" comfort soft T's made by Hanes. Avoid if you can."
3,Shrinking is a problem,"Shirts are soft and fit pretty well. Problem is they shrank very quickly. Specifically, they shrank in the length. Width is fine. Fit well when I tried them on before washing. Unfortunately I'm a tall guy so i won't be purchasing these again."
5,hanes tshirts,great delivery time... great product perfect fit... doesnt shrink too bad at all... but i recommend washing them before wearing them... really hard to get wrinkled... love the grey undershirt color goes with everything and doesnt stand out like white... love the taglessness
5,"Comfortable, durable, serves its purpose.","There isn't really much to say about a product like this. The shirts are comfortable, durable and the neckline that doesn't stretch out is also a plus. As far as undershirts go these will serve their purpose well."
1,Awful,"Shirts were an off-white color when they arrived, felt very cheap (which they were of course) but the yellowing did not help.... wil not purchase again."
2,Hanes t-shirts,The material is very thin. It is not nearly as good a quality as it used to be. I wouldn't buy anymore.
1,didnt get the products on time,didnt get the products on time didnt get the products on time still waiting....didnt get the products on time
2,Non Review of Paprika,I would have wanted to know that this DVD was recorded in PAL (European system) therefore it is not playable on U. S. TV. The English import was marked as PAL but this one was shipped from NJ and it did not indicate PAL system (neither does the cover) ..... Amazon did not do a good job.
5,It's been years.,But I still remember how deeply it effected me! I also remember how I almost couldn't finish it because toward the end I was sobbing so hard I couldn't see the letters! YOU MUST READ!!
5,better for mature readers,"I first read this book when I was about 9 years old after hearing about it church. I loved the story then, even though looking back on it now, I don't think I completely understood it. I reread the book when I turned 20 when it was given to me as a birthday gift, and cried through the whole thing. It meant so much more to me now that I understood more, and had actually had close friends go through the painful process of of aborting their unborn children. Some people may say that it is ""too pro-life"" or that it puts women who have choosen abortion in a bad light. In my opinion, it does just the opposite. It shows the loving forgiveness of a God who truly cares for His people. Even though the woman in the story sinned by taking the life of her child, she is forgiven and loved and freed from the horrible guilt caused by her decision. It serves as a reminder of His true deep love and compassion for the human race"
4,"A Powerful Story of Grace, Forgiveness and Love","When I think of Frank Peretti, Tilly isn't the type of story that comes to mind. Normally he writes great suspense stories. A friend gave me this to read, and I'm glad I did. Being a novella-it's a short read and an easy one, but it stays with you. If you've ever known anyone who suffers ongoing guilt, this would be a great healing tool.Theologically, it might raise a few eyebrows, but I think its purpose is to show how great God's grace truly is. I really enjoyed it."
5,Tilly by Frank Peretti,"I haven't read the book yet, but I am sure I will like it as well as all books by Frank Peretti."
2,Short But Sweet,"This is a short, very graphically emotional story, a little too syrupy for me..a stretch of the imagination."
4,loved the radio broadcast,"I first heard this story over a radio broadcast. It was just beautiful. Every scene was breathtaking. It haunted me for years. As an adult now, I recently ran across the book and read it. Although, it was good, it didnt quite capture the beauty that the radio broadcast had. I was a bit disappointed but it was a good story."
5,Talks avout the effect of abortion on a woman and God's love,The author talks primarily about a woman who has a abortion and a nurse that cares for the child afterward until it dies. It talks about the power of God's healing love. A must read for anyone who has had an abortion or is thinking about having one.
3,Not at all what I expected,"I came to this book looking for something I might offer to people going through this particular turmoil, and was disappointed. I read the many reviews of the solace to be found here, and frankly don't see it. While the character found release, I think a more realistic reaction might be a greater sense of pain. I applaud the effort to approach a subject many steer away from, but I found this to be a much too simplistic approach to a complex subject."
5,What a Surprise,"Having read quite a few of Frank Peretti's books, I wasn't expecting this sweet story. It had quite a twist on the abortion angle and something to think about for those of us who do believe in the after-life."

1,disappointing,"I've had these glasses @ a year and a half and they are starting to get condensation between the dual walls, and in 2 of the glasses - water between the walls. Don't waste your money."
1,double wall glasses,I would have to say that i was very disappointed in these glasses. After one time of using them-each one of them leaked into the wall of the glass. I would not recommend-nor would i buy again.
3,Good documentary but does not contain the Brain Fitness Exercises,"This is a well made documentary that explains the science behind the latest advances in neuroscience and applications but does not contain the Brain Fitness Exercises. For that you have to shell out $395:Posit Science Brain Fitness Program for One Person, PC Version"
2,Disappointed,"Unfortunetly, I thought this video was the mental exercisers to help the brain but it turned out to be a talking video!"
3,very interesting,I caught part of this show on TV and then went out to purchase it. The program goes into the causes and effects of sight and sound in relationship to age and other factors. I am using it in my art class to tell students how they see and how they can train their eyes and brain to work together to really see the world as it is vs. how our brain tells it is.
4,I need a more fit brain!,My husband and I have just begun to use Brain Fitness 2: Sight & Sound. We're both enjoying it. It's interesting to use and I have great hope it will help me keep the level of 'fitness' I now enjoy and perhaps improve it as I age. I'll get back to you with further updates.
4,Caution: changes in kit,"Caution to buyers: Weller (Cooper) has changed the contents of the kit. The product description says that the gun has dual lights - it doesn't, it has one bulb - and that the 8200PK kit contains a flux brush and a soldering aid tool: it doesn't have these in it at present. Obviously Cooper wanted to cost-reduce the contents but did not update the description vendors use. Tonight I shopped at three retailers and at every one the kit did not have the full claimed contents. One other problem: just try finding a retailer who carries the tips in stock. Fry's, Home Depot, Loewes did not. Only Orchard Supply in the SF Bay Area actually had them. Aside from this, the gun is functionally a good one and I have always been fond of Weller guns and will continue to buy them."
1,Strange tool,"I bought it at HD to replace my old soldering iron. What a stupid design ?! It has two positions for the trigger: max and medium heat and you have to have YOUR FINGER ON THE TRIGGER ALL THE TIME, otherwise it shuts off! It's probably OK for some quick and dirty type of work, but I found it very akward to use for soldering. I am taking it back and will think twice about purchasing Weller products in the future."
3,"Does the job, but not without some discomfort","It works pretty well, but I wish the kit included a few other tips as this one is gigantic and its size is not suitable for fine circuit work. I unintentionally melted some insulation on another wire because the tip is so big I couldn't see what was going on.Also, the trigger mechanism may be inherently safe, but it's not ergonomic. Having to sit there holding the trigger for 5 plus minutes to desolder a connection is a pain to say in the least. I haven't owned many other irons than this, but this one seems to take forever heating up."
1,Not good,"The design on this gun leaves much to be desired. The trigger mechanism for ""off"", ""low"" and ""high"" is terribly awkward to use and won't lock in either of the heat settings. This means that if your watching what you're soldering, and your attention wanders from your finger pressure you can inadvertently turn the gun to another heat setting or off altogether. We were very disappointed with the functionality of this tool and are returning it."
2,coil missing,So disappointing the 'kit' arrived without a coil to use the 'kit'.The description says it is includedSmall towns do not have such things.
4,weller soldering gun,"As expected, would like to have some smaller tips and a high/low switch instead of a 2 position trigger. Cannot find replacement tips. Does what it is supposed to. Thanks"
4,bought as gift,My father wanted this particular item and the price was good on Amazon. My father was pleased with this gift.
1,Off to the good will,"Like trying to make jewelry with an axe. Slow to heat up, as in very... like no settings, just a trigger. The unit cools when the trigger is released. Probably would be ok to put a big glob on trailer wires for example... nothing requiring any finesse. Maddening. Have had this for years and just dropped it into the Good Will bin... Buying a Weller WES51."
1,Not heating,"I had 2 of those, one after after first broke within 3 days of use. So 2nd broke as well.. Both wont heat up as fast as in their first days, while handle gets really hot. It takes about 10 mins to get them semi - operational, after which you won't be able to keep it in hands for work... Don't buy this product!"
3,OK guide,This is not the best literature guide I've found. It's OK but nothing special. I'm always looking for good activities and questions and this one had neither.
4,Beautiful however...,"This bracelet is as beautiful as I had hoped it would be; however, it does turn my arm slightly green, which rarely happens to me with silver...it does have the silver .925 markings inside. I'm still glad I bought it."
2,Not impressed,"My husband bought me a wok for xmas last year. He also bought me an incredible cook book on Thai cooking that is truly wonderful but a bit time consuming. I wanted a cookbook that teaches some basic recipes for simple and tasty stir fry without too many weird ingredients. This seemed like a good choice. Sadly, I haven't liked a single recipe that we've tried. The sauces are often too sweet and most seem to have a similar taste. I thought it might be the sherry that is often called for, but even after trying a sauce without the sherry I was disappointed with the flavor (very bland). There is nothing worse than cutting up tons of good quality meat and vegetables only to have them wasted in a poor tasting sauce! I do appreciate some of the tips in the beginning of the book, but beyond that I have nothing positive to say."
4,Very good documentary,Good piece of history. Wish there were more than 60 minutes to the video. Very educational and poignant. Everyone interested in music should watch it.
5,Awesome filmography!,"first saw this on a PBS special&said I have to have it,but where can I get it cheaper/faster,well Amazon of course!So i typed in a query search&lo and behold,buela'here it sit's in my home for me to ewnjoy anytime I want!Thx.,,AMAZON,YOU ROCK!"
5,Very Pretty,"I'm a fan of bioplast since the first time I wore one of these! They feel great, and the variety of colors is amazing! I love the combination of simple shape, convenience (no pain, no sticking to clothes, no weird marks on your skin when you wake up in the morning), and pretty colors! You can mix and match with your outfit and it always looks good! Love love love them!"
4,Warning,"It's epid yes!!!!!it's intresting yes!!!!!it's made for TV's from the 80's yes!!!!so the screen is not wide screen and NO you cant change it !Also no english dub, so you have to read and a lot.this show is a million hours of epic fantasy, very good but very very heavy."
4,Bigger than expected,I thought it was going to be smaller but glad it wasn't. Shipped and received fast. My sister loved it
4,Used this with D300,"So far I can get to 15 pictures continuous shooting at 1/8000 sec before the camera pauses. I am not sure if this is just the memory buffer's fault or the card. I plan to test with another card soon to compare, but I expected to get more pictures prior to when the pause in shooting occured."
3,Not bad for the price...,"I mean I suppose for the price I really can't complain. Build quality is a little cheap (but again price), however that being said it does function as advertised. Not a bad purchase all in all."
3,massager,I tried it on my back and it works fine but for the cellulite I don't think it is strong enough.
2,not good quality but cool product,"I am always a little skeptical of these products with few reviews that come from unknown sources and brands, and this product confirms my unease. The massager is not good quality and is made more like a prototype than a finished product, the fabric just ripped off as I was trying to pry off the --untwistable-- cover which I do not think is what they mean by ""cover removal."" The device is irreparable but probably better use without the cover anyway. I have not used it for long but I have hope that the rotating motion will reduce some of my cellulite. The product seems like it will do the trick provided it lasts but I am not sure about the likelihood of this scenario and for that I give two stars."
2,Too many bristles,Didn't work for my beagle-basset. It may have worked beautifully if the bristles weren't so compact. I will be donating it to my groomer.
5,Wow!,"My Shih-Poo George is 11 years old and I had yet to find a brush that he finds ""tolerable"". George is small but a real terror at brush time, until now. He will actually sit on my lap and let me brush him to some extent, which frankly is amazing. I wish I'd found this brush 11 years ago, our lives would have been much easier. Excellent product & George approved!"
3,Just OK,"I almost didn't read the whole book. I got through three quarters and just didn't care about the story any longer. I guess every author can have a bad book but it seemed like a lot of filler and not much story. I do like hearing about the characters and how they are doing, like old friends. I just think the plots are a bit weak."
4,Good Kinsey Millhone read,"I enjoyed this offering in the Kinsey Millhone series. I was also glad to see Kinsey with a boyfriend, Cheney Phillips. Let's not have him disappear from the scene later, too, like Robert Dietz!"
2,Disappointing,"This book was disappointing. Kinsey tries to help a very wealthy man keep his daughter on the right path. The book incldes some side paths, and a couple of scenes of violence. While the plot is believable, then ending and outcome are not. We've come to expect better from this author."
1,R is or Ricochet,I thought it was a new book not a soft copy of a hard book which I already own........waste of money and sorry I didn't pay more attention....should not have advertised as new.......
2,"""D"" is for disappointing","As a Grafton devotee, who has waited anxiously for each alphabetical adventure to reach the bookstore, this was my first real disappointment. Usually intriqued by Kinsey and her capers, I found the floundering Kinsey taking orders from Reba, the jailbird she was being paid to keep straight too farfetched. Like it much better when Kinsey is in control and uses her wits and attitude to keep me interested. It was a struggle to finish the book and I had the feeling even Grafton got bored with it. Hope ""Q"" brings more of the quality we have come to expect from her."
4,I liked the romance,"Anyone who has read the whole alphabet series to date know thatKinsey had 2 husbands and several romances. I must admit I cheered that she may finally get her man. You must remember that the story takes place in 1986 or so and some of the social mores have changed. As far as the story went it held my interest. there were others I liked better but that should be expected in a 26 novel series. All in all an enjoyable read andway to go Kinsey, only next time don't wait for him to call if you have somthing to say."
3,Hmmm....Okay.....,"Q is for Quarry was so good, probably her best...that I was kind of disappointed in this one. It did not ""grip"" me like most of her books and I found it easy to put it down and not pick it back up for days. Usually, I am speeding through a Sue Grafton in a day or so. Too bad..."
2,Average at best.,"This was a dismal offering for the usually witty and entertaing series. Perhaps the author is running out of steam with the series or perhaps she simply didn't know how to make the story move with Kinsey's usual intelligence, wit and character. She seemed to just be propelled along by others the entire story line and offer nothing of herself.Always allowing herself to do what -Reba- wanted with the rather weak explination of ""what could i do?"". In each instance- she always had the option of doing the smart thing but instead let herself be dragged into situations with a display of rather weak will and repetitive McDonald's eating.I hope the series picks up again or maybe i'll have to start at the beginning again for the best storylines and characters."
1,"""R"" rates an ""F""","What is this anyway? I felt like I was reading a romance, which isn't *quite* my favorite genre. Where's the mystery? It doesn't even rate well as a thriller.I've read ""A"" to ""R"" and this is certainly the worst. To think it took nearly 2 years for Ms. Grafton to write this. We'll see if she gets back to form in ""S""!"
2,Not sure what 'R' is for,"I'm reluctant to give this such a low rating, but honestly, Sue Grafton is so much better than this tired entry in the Alphabet series. Kinsey is so willing to be led around by the nose, not only by Reba, but by Cheney, that I wanted to smack her one and tell her to snap out of it. The non-mystery is less-than-engaging, the characters are mostly annoying, and the writing lacks any sparkle. I was far more interested in Henry's romantic adventures than anything else.Now that I've thought about it, maybe 'R' should have been for ""Rewrite."""
2,R is for ... Really disappointed,"As many reviewers have pointed out, this latest installment of Sue Grafton's alphabet series finds Kinsey Millhone reduced to basically a chaffeur for a parolee who displays the common sense of a doorknob. And Kinsey, inexplicably, just goes along with everything. Private investigator? The scattered instances of Kinsey actually investigating anything are mildly interesting but few and far between. I give the book two stars -- one for just continuing the series about a character that many of us love, and one for the hypochondriacal discourses of the character William, which are a hoot.This book reminded me of the lackluster ""H is for Homicide,"" which, despite the title, was mostly about ... auto insurance fraud (yawn), and in which Kinsey again spent most of the book going along for the ride, literally. If you want to read about money laundering, then knock yourself out with ""R,"" but as for me, if I'm going to read a mystery, give me a juicy murder any day."
3,"Not Her Best, But Not Bad Either","I have read everyone of the Kinsey Millhone mysteries from the begining and have generally loved the books.While I did enjoy this book, I found it did bog down in several places.This book had the a good, not great, plot and although you could figure out the ending a little, there was still some surprise left when all the pages were turned. This particular book had more of the personal life of Kinsey than in previous books, and the details of Henry and his family rift were a little boring, but the main character,Reba, was great.Overall, a good read, but if you are not a Kinsey Millhone fan, you most likely will not enjoy it."
2,Big Disappointment,"Like most Sue Grafton fans I was really looking forward to this latest installment in the Kinsey Millhone series. Unfortunately, this book was a big disappointment. Hundreds of pages were used to provide what I thought was background and setup for some great payoff to come. Alas, the kicker never came. Reading this book was like engaging in prolonged foreplay without the climax. Very unsatisfying. As another reviewer noted, Kinsey was inexplicably complacent throughout the drama. She abdicated control of the situation to a flighty, impulsive felon at every turn. The romance between Kinsey and an old acquaitance was pointless and the two lacked any kind of emotional connection. But that could be the nature of the characters. I now feel compelled to run out and buy another Dan Brown novel to get a fix of gripping suspense and intelligent intrigue."
2,"R is for ""Remaindered Bin"" (reduced to $2.98)","I have read most of the entries in this series -- I missed P & Q, but I thought ""O Is For Outlaw"" was well-done, even though it fizzled out a bit near the end. This R entry, however, is the weakest of the ones I've read. Henry & his brothers should be committed to nursing homes for the senile -- or, they should be eliminated via fatal heart attacks. So Kinsey's got a sincere, seemingly enduring romance going -- or is it a sub/dom relationship? And it has made her slap-happy to the point that she no longer bothers to carry a gun. I would advise Grafton's publisher to cut its losses, and consign this dud to the remaindered bins -- and assign a new editor to the ""S"" book, one who is not merely a yes-person."
3,Kinsey acted like a novice,"I have read, and enjoyed, all of Sue Grafton's novels and ""R is for Ricochet"" is no exception. I liked Reba in spite of her foolishness, but I kept waiting for Kinsey to take control of the situation. It was out of character for Kinsey to do some of the dumb things she did, such as telling Nord where Reba was over a telephone line that surely was tapped; not arranging for protection nor carrying a weapon when meeting thugs in a parking lot; letting (the slippery)Reba out of her sight so often, etc. Kinsey acted much too naive considering her age and experience, and contrary to the savy she exhibted in past cases. Grafton seemed to be holding back--almost like she was trying not to offend any readers, however you can't write a good thriller when you're trying too hard to be politically correct."
3,"Last part, mostly OK","The book picks up about halfway through it, but that's just a bit too late to warrant more stars than three. The first part of the novel just sort of wanders around, wasting time and paper. The long sections involving the octogenarian brothers' love affair was just plain dull (was it supposed to be cute?) and kept the reader from the central plot. Then, the soft-core sex life of our heroine may titilate a few readers, but not this one. I found myself skipping whole pages. Finally, the long section explaining money laundering accomplished nothing except tell the reader that the writer did research into the crime of money laundering. The details could have been dismissed in a paragraph or so; not all the research had to be included.In short, this is not nearly as disciplined as some of the writer's other mysteries. ""R"" needed a good editor with a handful of blue pencils. Cut about 100 pages of this, and the book was interesting."
2,R is for Run Away!,"Two years ago I accidently discovered Sue Grafton by reading ""L is for Lawless."" I was so taken by her writing and memorable characters that I had to start at the beginning. I read her books faster than you could sing the alphabet song. When I finished last summer's ""Q is for Quarry,"" I couldn't wait for ""R."" My opinion just changed. With all due respects to the author, you should run away from this book. No meat. No mystery. No cliffhangers. Believe me, you can put this book down. Everything up until now - go for it - devour every page! True fans will still enjoy this offering because we all pull for Kinsey. If you collect Grafton's books, you should buy it. But if you don't, visit your friendly neighborhood library and put your name on the list like most of us do. Read it because it is a series and to show your loyalty. Otherwise, run away. Run as far as you can."
2,I honestly suspect McDonald's product placement,"No kidding--I am beginning to think McDonald's is paying Grafton to mention their products.How many times do Kinsey and Reba eat massive quantities of quarter pounders, moan with the pleasure, and discuss how unhealthy yet fabulously delicious they are? Does that have anything to do with the plot?Then once, when Kinsey went out for dinner, she says she passed McDonald's for one and went to a ""competitor's fast food restaurant."" What, she's not allow to include the words ""Burger King""??Pondering the possibility of product placement even began to distract me from the admittedly already weak story.Also, these stories have become period pieces, so locked as they are in the 1980s with typewriters and pay phones. Of course, to speed Kinsey ahead 15 years or so would mean that Henry would have passed on. So she's utterly locked into the time frame."
3,Getting better but still not there.,In this episode of the long endearing saga of Kinsey Milhoun we have not one but two scatter-brained broads. Like most of Grafton's work there seems to be a lot that relies on misunderstandings and misconceptions that could easily be cleared up with simple explanations except that that would shorten the book by half. I think I Love Lucy first pioneered that gag.
3,A little disappointing,"I hated to give a 3 to this book, because I love all the Kinsey books. But she was just out of character in this episode ... she didn't hold firm to any of her decisions or thoughts ... just fell in and did whatever Reba wanted to do. She's usually much stronger than that, and not as gullible. This also wasn't really a ""who-done-it"" to solve because we basically knew who did what.I do like the slowly advancing romance with Cheney (hate the name tho lol) and that maybe she will have a SO in her life, although very possibly not marriage. But it could work well for them.I was sorry to see that she didn't keep in touch with Stace and Con after their adventure was over ... she just ""heard"" things about them, like they were doing ok."
5,R is for Ricochet,The book is fun but I thought I was ordering the new Grafton novel so I was a bit surprised when this arrived. I went to the site to pre order the new book coming out in the Fall. It is true if the the price sounds too good to be true it sure is!! I still can't wait for the new book. I have read and enjoyed them all.
4,Much Better than the Last,"Another rather long one for Grafton. I was trying to finish this curious if she went to so much detail thru the whole book to give a short ending. The ending was as much detailed. Will Kinsey and this Cheney last...will Reba get out of CIW and return in a future mystery???This was one of the better ones for Grafton...worth reading!!!What does ""S"" have in store for us???"
3,Another Kinsey Milhone story,"Kinsey is hired by wealthy Santa Teresa businessman, Nord Lafferty, to travel to the California Institute for Women, to pick up his daughter, Reba, who is being released on parole, after spending two years in jail for embezzlement. Reba claims that she ""took the fall"" for her former employer and lover, Alan Beckwith, who was laundering drug money. Kinsey is supposed to stay close to Reba until she finds her feet again, but finds this a very difficult job as she's always sneaking off to meet Beck, as he is known. Kinsey and Reba eventuslly find a secret room in Beck's new offices, where the money is sorted and channeled off to safe accounts, and Reba finally realises that she has been charmed and used by Beck. It's an ok story but some of the money laundering details grew a bit involved for me, so the story dragged a bit...I would have preferred a bit more action."
3,Not the usual Kinsey fare.,"This book is quite different than the usual Kinsey Millhone book. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I found that Kinsey almost played a secondary role in this book. Also there really was no mystery as such. It's actually in the thriller genre, I think. One of the main reasons why I read Sue Grafton is to get up close and personal with Kinsey. Her character is so strong, and so well-crafted that it seems like she's a real person. In this book I found Kinsey subdued, remote and really not involved in the story much. The idea behind the book is a good one - a complex money-laundering scheme of a huge magnitude, but as I was reading, I couldn't help thinking - ""Who really cares?"" And the plot is really pretty predictable as well. I'm sorry, but this is not my favourite Kinsey Millhone, by quite a long shot."
3,Very Interesting Read,"This is one of the better Sue Grafton's. It was a book that was easy to get into. Reba was a different character and I didnt know whether to root for her or slap her upside the head. The Lucinda character was someone we have all come in contact with at one time. Kinsey has a heart of gold and to me seems too easy a mark, but at least Cheney was an interesting addition. Henry is a repeating character and his story was a little boring which I scanned over quickly. Not much happening there but he does come in handy as an anchor for Kinsey.This was a good, quick summer read. Better than the last ""Q""."
2,Disappointing,"Kinsey Milhone really seemed to take back stage throughout -- the real protagonist was Reba. This reads like a non-series novel about Reba, which was somehow pushed into the Kinsey Milhone series. Too much hanging about, waiting for _Reba_ to move things on, with repetitive descriptions of food. The story really gets going only near the end. The various threads are rather too obviously brought together (eg Lucinda's role at the end, or Misty's 'secret' transactions.)"
1,No Mystery Here!,"Just like everyone else, I love Sue Grafton's alphabet series. This meant R is for Ricochet was a disappointment for me.I think it's great that Grafton wants to try some new ideas (the series can use some perk!), but this was just too out there.I kept reading wondering where the mystery is! This was just a story about Kinsey and Reba Lafferty. No mystery, no murder, nothing.I got the feeling that it was time to write R and Sue didn't have any ideas so she came up with this. I hope that S will get back on track with some good ol' mystery."
3,Where's Kinsey?,"This wasn't a bad story, but it wasn't typical of the series. Kinsey is usually much smarter than she was in this book -- I was confused about why she'd abandon her common sense for someone she didn't even know all that well, and go along with stupid ideas and make stupid choices.I also wish Ms. Grafton would cut down on the clutter...there's far too many pages taken up with paragraphs and paragraphs of absolutely nothing.Still, it's one of the best series around, so it's worth reading."
2,boring,"Just plain and simple......This book was boring.I am on the last chapter, and it still hasn't gotten exciting."
5,Better and Better.,"I'm a fan of this series and I'm happy to say this title doesn't disappoint. I love the changes in the wind for Kinsey and that she is allowed to loosen up a little here, too. The story is taught, exciting and believable and I was not disappointed by the characters I have come to love. I've read them all and this is one of the best. I can't wait for the next one!"
2,Yada-Yada-Yada,"Not only did I not have trouble putting this one down, it's been a week and I haven't picked it back up! Grafton should take up poetry. She runs on and on describing everything from the color of some building, down to a single blade of grass. I have completely enjoyed ""A"" through ""N"" and then things started going wrong. If you want to learn about ""money laundering"" and IRS involment in GREAT DEPTH, then maybe this is the book for you! If you suffer from sleeplessness, this one will ""dull"" you right to sleep!"
3,A bump in the road,"I don't know what happened. I loved A through Q, but Grafton has faltered with R. The first half is dedicated to three romances, the subplot with the elderly brothers being the only good one. Some of the scenes seem forced, which is so atypical of this author. The character of Reba is poorly constructed and rings false. There is no chemistry between Reba and Kinsey, or Kinsey and her latest boyfriend. The detective work is nonexistent until the last 30 pages. This is not vintage Grafton! I still recommend her fans read it though, as she's always entertaining, but don't expect her usual caliber of work. Let's hope this one was just a small bump in the road, which is to be expected in such a long series."
2,R is for Retire,Tediously plodding book. I kept hoping that it would hit its stride but it never did. Time to hang it up.
3,mixed bag of fun and boredom,"Ok, the title just plain stinks. Where is the ricochet? Huh?Getting past that, the story is good in parts, such as the flight to Reno and LA, but boring in parts too. And the ending wrapped up a little too neatly at the end, like the author suddenly threw together a hokey explanation to finish the story in the last two pages. Kinsey's love life and her friendship with Henry are consistent with the entire alphabet series. Quaint references to pre-home computer days enter this 1987 based story. Overall, I found this to be a subpar Millhone story."
1,R is for Rotten,"I have read all of the rest of the alphabet series and loved them. I can't imagine what happened with this one but the plot, the characters, lack of suspense etc. were terrible. Kinsey acted as if she didn't have a brain in her head. I hope the next book is better. Don't bother with this one!"
1,One more mystery writer bites the dust,"In volumes ""A"" through ""Q"" we watched Mrs. Grafton grow from a women with a cute mystery, worth reading, to a serious mystery writer. But this book is the prostitution of all that talent for the praise of dirty-minded little book critics.Apparently she now has a new editor. The new one can't edit. ""R"" contains partial sentences, sentences with missing words, and lost thoughts inserted in the wrong places, hanging there as if they were picked up from the cutting room floor and stuffed in through a silt in the plot.All these errors do not destroy a readable book, BUT, now gratuitous sex has been introduced.Mrs. Grafton is talented enough to let us know what happened between the sheets without assaulting our sensitivities. But, somehow, I presume the new editor talked her into selling her soul, a good mystery writer has now become a poor sex book author.I couldn't finish the book."
3,Tired prose,"Sue Grafton is clearly running out of steam on this series. She spins her wheels endlessly, describing every tiny little move, the scenery, squabbles among her friends, and blah, blah, blah! Most good mystery writers start out with a bang and tighten the hold on a reader instantly, urging them not to let go until the read is over. This one, and regrettably, like the last one, I had no trouble putting down."
1,ho-hummer,"A friend recommended Sue Grafton. So, I read her latest, and after the first chapter I nearly put it down. The ridiculous love life of an 87 year old stud almost did it, but then the crap about his family...well, I wanted a mystery, and all I got was soap. Fortunately, I checked the book out at the library, otherwise I would have asked for a refund."
3,VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS,"AFTER READING ALL OF THE STEPHANIE PLUM BOOKS, THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A LET DOWN. NOT AS FAST MOVING AND CAPTIVATINGLY FUNNY AS THE 10 SERIES. I HOPE THERE WILL BE AN 11."
2,This is the 18th time Grafton's written this book,This series is getting old and stale and Grafton needs to give it up. She's written basically the same book eighteen times and it takes her longer to write it now than it did twenty years ago or whenever she started this series. If you want a series that shows character development and growth and read Susan Conant's Holly Winter Dog Lover's mysteries or Lilian Jackson Braun's The Cat Who series. R was only slightly more interesting than N and P.
3,"""R"" is for Restless...","...which I am more and more becoming with the Kinsey Milhone series. 15 years ago the ambling pace was welcome, as was Grafton's elegant, descriptive prose, which is still very much in evidence here. (At the same time, does anyone really know what pittosporum and eugenia shrubs look like?) There are some wonderful scenes (particularly a seduction over mac-and-cheese that's pretty hot -- and beautifully written) and vivid characters -- but it doesn't add up to much. Perhaps the problem is mine, that I've graduated to Michael Connelly and Ian Rankin, whose twisty, fast-paced, grittier works mooooove. It's the difference between a pedal-to-the-metal chase through city streets and a slow, meandering drive in the country. The drive may be pleasant enough...but it's not really going anywhere."
5,R is For Ricochet,"I have every single book from A-R so far and am looking forward to S is for Silence, which I see is the next title. Being interested in mysteries, I naturally did what my grade 10 english teacher told me to and picked up and read one of Ms. Grafton's books and next thing I know I'm hooked and haven't stopped yet. R is for Ricochet will keep you on your toes until the very last page. It's a great read and your imagination will wander, wondering what Kinsey's next move will be. She's always either getting herself into trouble or figuring out the clues like a true private investigator. Unlike many mystery writers, Ms. Grafton knows how to keep her readers involved in her stories and I, for one congratulate her on a terrific job so far!"
1,R is for Really Bad,"I have read all of the Grafton books, and this is by far the worst. It is not a mystery, it is not suspense, and it is not even a good ""woman's book"". There are endless descriptions of mundane activities like Kinsey folding her underwear and shopping for clothes. It's like watching the paint dry."
2,HOOOOOHUM,"I was very disappointed in this book!! Sue Grafton did not display her usual flare for a mystery thriller. She portrayed Kinsey as a hapless puppy to Reba. She hooks Kinsey up with a new beau (Cheney) and all of a sudden, Kinsey becomes a dumb, helpless female without a whit of sense. Reba, a convicted felon, showed more intelligence and hootspah. Kinsey just followed along with whatever Reba wanted to do even though she knew better, left her brain shelved at home or in the bedroom with Cheney.No mystery here...just stupidity!"
5,Glad to have her back,"I forgot how much I enjoyed this author. No matter how long it takes for a book to come out, Sue Grafton is always consistent in her characters and each book feels like coming home. Even though it had been over 2 years since her last book came out, I was able to pick right back up in the life of Kinsey. I do not understand how any true fan of Sue Grafton could find fault with this book. It was all her and fun. I personally loved that fact that Kinsey was able to have a bit of romance this time around. Her sarcasm and wit make me hope Sue Grafton has a long life and finishes up with the alphabet. Just loved the book. Glad to have her back."
1,Deadly dull,"I completely agree about the filler. I skipped paragraph after paragraph. Would have been interesting to read what Kinsey thought or felt about what was going on, but in most situations, no luck. I also object when characters do something stupid or out of character in order to move the plot along. Kinsey is supposed to be an independent thinker, but in this case the story wouldn't have had any forward motion unless she unquestioningly let Reba lead her around by the nose. Complete nonsense. I agree, Grafton is fulfilling an obligation, not writing entertainment."
2,Not her best. Kinsey needs more.,"Kinsey needs to get a life. Maybe Kinsey should travel some and get out of the alias for Santa Barbara.The first part of this book seemed like it was cut and pasted from the other 17 books with the same characters. I bet it is a real challenge to keep them fresh but that was what she accepted when she decided to write about this little burg and these few characters.I didn't get into the story until the last one third of the book.Although she has had one or two clingers in her alphabet series, Ms Grafton is better than that."
2,Avoid This Ricochet,"I've read every Sue Grafton written, and on the basis of this latest effort, I think Sue should knock Kinsey off and try a new detective. Milhone is completely ineffectual in this volume, simply letting circumstances play out. There is no detective work to speak of, and the plot is so thin that Grafton pads the book shamelessly with numbing descriptions of such things as federal money laundering statutes and irrelevant side plots like Henry's love life. Characters wander in, bore us for a while, and then are never heard from again. This has the sickening feel of a book written solely to meet a contractual obligation. The well has run dry. Don't waste your time with this book. Grafton's earlier volumes were far superior."
3,"does not fit an E1505 15.4"" notebook","The description is deceiving this case does not fit a dell notebook with a 15.4"" screen. The product a good product especially for the price but don't buy if you have a 15.4"" screen"
4,Great for calendars - Legal issues in using code,"I highly recommend the book if you are interested in calendars as a hobby. If you are using this book for a project I suggest you look at this soley as a reference, since you will have to look elsewhere to have something you can use. The bibliography included is a good source.The details and discussions of how they approach problems like the visibility of sunset are amazing and really opened my eyes to the difficulties of creating an accurate calendar under different systems. This book covers everything I could think of and quite a few ideas I would never consider.I would give it 5 stars, except that the code and algorythms provided in the book are copyrighted and can not be used without explicit permission of the authors. I contacted the authors for a project I had, but it was determined that I could not use their algorithms since I intended to release under GNU license."
1,Wattage not as advertised,"As soon as I received this Weller today, I checked the electrical specs with a watt meter when I first plugged it in. Rather than the 260/200 as advertised, mine came up closer to 140/100, their less expensive model, though the label on this one did indicate D550PK. It's on its way back for a refund."
1,First reaction,Dead on arrival right out of the box. Return was easy so I'll have to report back on how the replacement was.
4,Pro kit for soldering,Great kit for semi pro soldering. Has all the pieces necessary- waiting to use it to solder small pieces now
5,Thanks,This a great soldering gun. Does every thing I could expect and I have been using soldering guns for 50 or more years.Thanks
3,Hard to use,"the trigger has two setting, full pull for low and a medium pull for high. No stay on setting, so i had to wrap a wire around the handle to keep it hot for a big job."
1,Not your father's soldering gun.,"Gun I received did not heat properly, 260 watts?, and neither of the built in work lights would light. Does not have the quality of the gun it was to replace."
4,"Works, but...","I was disappointed to see how crude the fit and finish were on this unit. But, at the end of the day, the thing works the way it's supposed to."
4,Case is flawed,"When I first opened this carrying case the lid broke like a cheap shotgun. I went to Amazon and got a toolbox to put all my electric and soldering supplies in. This will be better for me in the long run. If the case is not really a concern for you as it is not for me, the gun will probably be a great addition to your shop as it will be to mine."
1,Beware!,"If you buy this gun, take it outside the first time you use it!Plugged it in, hit the trigger and my garage was filled with a horrible smell. Afterwards the gun will not heat up at all. You can hear it humming, but the barrels and tip produce no heat at all.Weller was once top shelf U.S.A. made product, now it's south of the border crap.A day later, the stink still lingers!"
3,"OK, but not as good as the Weller it replaced","My 20 year old Weller soldering iron finally bit the dust. was pleased to see that amazon sold a comparable model for a competitive price. my biggest gripe, and this may seem trivial, is that the case is cheesy. the plastic see-through top, while a good idea, is not affixed firmly and is flimsy and falls out. I would prefer a better designed case that closes firmly. i know i will not get a metal one like my other Weller (the new iron does not fit), but plastic is ok if its heavy duty as it does not rust. Soldering iron does not seem to get as hot as my other iron, but it was a higher wattage (280 vs 260/200). still, all in all, not a bad buy. just needs a redesign on the box."
3,Maybe yes Maybe no,"Bought first gun three weeks ago. Worked fine as for heating up quickly and output seems fine. However, the lights stopped working after the first use. Sent it back and just got a replacement from Amazon within a few days. Amazon is usually great in that respect!! I plan on using the new gun today to see if it was just that gun or if the product is inferior or not."
2,Could've been a wonderful story.....,"Three Wishes, along with the other books in the Sugar Mountain trilogy, had such potential to be a wonderful story. In my opinion - and it is just my opinion - it fell flat. The Skylar brothers are carbon copies of each other instead of each being a wonderful hero all on his own. After reading the other two books, this one was very predictable. Unfortunately, I didn't even finish it."
1,why is this on Prime?,"This move looks like it was made on a camcorder, with truly bad acting and an epically bad script. Just even having this on Prime brings down my perception of Prime in general. Don't bother watching, unless you want to just laugh at the movie."
1,"Well, ....",The fellow can do all that with an obvious Apple 3G iPhone? Wow. I wonder how good his Droid is!
5,walking shoes,"These Ryka's are the best walking shoe I have ever worn! Cute and comfortable, and a good price."
4,"Sharp, witty and on the dot.","I studied image consulting with Robert Pante last year and he helped me break though many personal barriers i had put up towards more success. He is not interested in trying to puff up your ego. He is commited to helping you gain results in your life. Changing my image has helped me personally gain tremendous confidence and it shows in how my colleagues, clients and friends now see me. He comes highly recommended!"
1,This guy's a jerk,"Don't buy this book! This guy is a creep who humiliates people mercilessly at his Dressing to Win seminars. Women run out in tears. One of the most thoughtless, arrogant, vicious, and shallow human beings I have ever come across. Let someone else teach you how to dress. It ain't brain surgery."
2,"5 star music, 1 star sound quality","This collection contains the albums ""Booker Little 4 and Max Roach"" and ""Booker Little and Friend"" aka ""Victory and Sorrow."" These albums are excellent, first-rate jazz and well worth buying. However, the sound quality on this collection is sub-par for albums that came out in 1958 and 1961 respectively. The music sounds distant, slightly fuzzy and flat. Also, for some reason this collection omits the last two tracks from ""Booker Little 4 and Max Roach"", the songs ""Things Ain't What They Used to Be"" and ""Blue 'n Boogie"". These albums are well worth buying separately, as are all the recordings on which Little played."
5,Fantasic - Loved it!,June 2008 - Loved it so much I purchased both the DVD and VHS the next day. I will be watching this many times over and am pleased it is part of my collection. Oh where is a time machine when you need it. Love the 1700s yes life was short but it is the quality not the quantity that matters. Just made my day and brought stunning colour into an ordinary rainy day. I just saw it quite by chance and thought oh goodness this is FANTASTIC!
4,Steele's first two collections,"Sapphics and Uncertainties contains Tim Steele's first two collections of Poetry, ""Sapphics against Anger and Other Poems"" and ""Uncertainties and Rest."" It's a slim volume of intelligent poetry written in meter and form. This collection, much like the lates one ""Color Wheel"", shows why Steele is considered one of the best poets writing formal verse. Every line, every word is well thought out. Steele is one of the poets that should be on your shelf."
4,the best of the New Formalists,"Timothy Steele, in terms of his command of meter and rhyme, wit and irony, powers of observation and restraint, is the finest of the New Formalist poets. My only complaint with his work is that I get a strong sense of deja vu when reading it -- sometimes I think I'm reading Richard Wilbur instead. (Of course, Richard Wilbur is hardly a bad model.) Steele writes almost entirely in meter and rhyme and is the most competent poet featured in the ""Rebel Angels"" anthology."
5,Awesomely funny,"This is hands-down the funniest business book I've ever read, (and that includes Jack Welch's autobiography ;-)A dead-on parody of big silly business, of which I am, sadly, a part, it has something for everyone: quick little shorts that had me rolling, absurdly funny charts and graphs, and longer features like the ""adventure metaphor"" called ""Swimming with the Sharks"" -- which tells the story of a group of execs who go on a team-building excursion that requires them to spend 48 hours swimming in a great white shark feeding ground. Outstanding.Overall, just excellent."
1,Cheesy and derivative,"This book tries way too hard. And it falls flat. Obviously the author desperately wishes he worked at The Onion, but he's nowhere near funny enough.A true waste of trees and money."
2,"Funnily enough, not really that funny at all","Let me start by saying I am a great fan of satirewire.com, which is where the material from this book first appeared. The website is very quick to produce hysterically funny material, focussing on the events of the day and skewering the rogues who need to be skewered. And that is part of the problem with this book -- much of the material is pretty old and refers back to events that no one really remembers that well and therefore do not resonate. The jokes have no immediacy. I read much of the book and thought ""This I'm sure was funny then, but it sure falls flat now"". The buzzwords and fads of the boom-times in the 1990s are just vague memories now and have very much lost their bite. So while I'll continue to log on to the website, I'm going to give away this book."
4,Better than expected,From the cover of this book I was really dreading reading it. The collection of essays has turned out to be really quite good. Very unexpected.
5,Excelente,La presentacion de este libro es de primera clase. Es un libro muy bonito con fotos increibles.
5,Good product for the money,"Purchased this mag drill to drill holes in one-inch steel plate. The drill worked very well, much better than expected for the price. Good points - drilled holes are square to the plate, speed appropriate for 1/2 and 5/8-inch drills, still running fine after about 100 holes. Not so good points - drill motor is very noisy - wear ear plugs. Also the supplied drill chuck is junk. I replaced it with a cheap Jacobs drill chuck for less than $15 - big improvement. While not on par with a drill several times the price, it is worth the money. I would recommend it, just plan on replacing the chuck."
3,Caveat about reading this on your Kindle,"The content is interesting but if you are reading it on your Kindle and hoping to be able to jump to one of the references and return to your place in the text, then forget it. The publishers could have but didn't hyperlink the references within the text. If you just want to read the book from cover to cover then it's fine."
1,Tall and light stranger,Not a CD to buy when wanting easy listening too boring - made for German market. Booklet with CD. Robert Mitchum's gravelly voice does not come through as it should. Not a good buy. Recommend Calypso Is Like So.
3,Nice but not perfect,"The shift knob itself is beautiful. I have it installed in my 06 Acura TL, and I love how the carbon fiber on the knob matches the carbon fiber in the interior trim.The cons of this knob are:1. It gets extremely hot after the car has been parked in the sun for a while, and can burn your hand if you're not careful.2. The screws that secure the knob to the shaft tend to loosen over time and have to be re-tightened every 3-4 weeks, which can get annoying."
4,"Warning, Jacket will poke your eye's out! (ok maybe not)","First of all, i just DON'T understand the negative reviews this album has garnered. The only thing i can figure is people want his more brash and less polished work via his Moldy Peaches days and that certainly isn't what this album is. What it is though is a continuation of weird, wonderfully odd poetic tunage with quality musicianship to it. Sometimes still slightly raunchy but way more under control than in years past (or as i like to think of it raunchy with a purpose to the song)This is Adam Green growing up but doing so in his way and making engaging music which moves the brain and hell...perhaps your hips too."
1,Good Lord,Garfiels and Friends of Mine were fantastic. Obviously this guy got too big for his britches and neglected everything that made him worth a damn in the first place. Please stop producing this horrible garbage Adam I beg you.
1,Stop please,"How does this joker have a record deal? I know, Garfied and Friends of Mine wich this is so far from it makes me want to cry"
4,Earth-shattering Poems,"Persons who love poetry will enjoy the mix of poems in this book. However, to call all of the poems ""earth-shattering"" does not translate to all of the poems being in a book entitled ""earth shattering."" Nearly all of the poems are well crafted but I did find a couple that left me without that ""ah"" feeling. It is a book that I would recommend. Poetry is in the mind of the reader."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE POT!!!,"Dad told me not to throw the old coffee pot away before we tried this new one. I didn't listen. This Toastmaster Stainless Steel Coffee Maker is the worst coffee pot ever made. Ditto with the other comments about spillage, inconvenience, and too quick shut-off time. And only 8 cups at a time. I thought it was a 12 cup pot but I was mistaken. Useless coffee pot. Who wants to start their day off with this kind of hassle. Not me! Thanks for letting me voice my opinion. deanna"
1,Not just worst coffeemaker. Worst small appliance ever.,"I bought this used at a thrift store. That should have been my first clue. The 2 pressure flow mechanisms, one on the bottom of the basket, the other on top of the pot, have to be aligned perfectly with just the right pressure, which is impossible unless you lift the coffeepot 3/32 of an inch. You might as well try to balance 2 golf balls ontop of each other. Well the coffee didnt flow into the pot fast enough, causing the paper filter to overflow washing grounds over the edge and further clogging the flow mechanisms. Designed to fail. How did this machine ever make it past testing and onto the market? I want my $8 back."
1,Broke after only 2 uses!,I purchased this coffee maker as a long distance gift. I believe the carafe never fit properly into the main coffee area - because the coffee kept overflowing over the top of the filter.
1,Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker,"I hoped this would be an excellent way of having coffeee made and kept warm. Right away I had difficulty with the coffee brewing and pouring anywhere but into the carafe. I called Toastmaster who told me a particular way I had to put the carafe and the funnel but although it improved short term it proved too awkward to keep getting it ""right"" and could not rely on walking away to let it brew alone or put the timer on. I would like to return the coffee maker but have not done so yet."
1,Poor Quality,"This is not an easy pot to use...I got it because I wanted a thermal coffee pot and it was the least expensive. I found it to be more of a hastle than it was worth and I returned it and went back to my old drip pot. Bargains are great, but only when you get a respectable product."
2,Awkward to Use this Setup,"I wish I had seen the other reviews before I bought this. The carafe pouring is ridiculous. The manufacturer indicates that the button on the handle allows easy pouring. Not so. You have to awkwardly push down the button on top of the carafe (the one that allows you to pour coffee while a brew is going)while you pour. You invariably spill coffee on the counter while you are doing this. As for the thermal qualities, not impressed. The coffee is not all that hot going into the carafe, and cools rather quickly. I only make 4 cups at a time, so perhaps that is a factor. It is an adequate machine, it does what it claims to do, but I should have stuck to the cheap $20 models. They work just as well."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this for my husband as a Christmas gift. I thought..""looks stylish"" compliaments our kitchen, has good features.Till the first time he used it. Poor man out in the kitchen 7:00 in the morning cleaning up coffee that had ""missed"" the pot and was all over the counter. He has been fiddling with it ever since. I asked him if he wanted to send it back, but he ""keeps trying to get it to work correctly""The digiial read out must have shorted out with the initial spill because it doesn't work anymore.I can't immagine anyone paying $70.00 for this. I can't belive I paid what I did! for such good craftsmanship :("
4,Surprisingly useful for today's women's groups,"This little volume is a surprisingly enjoyable gem, despite its age. It offers many insights for people involved in today's women's groups.Basically, the author talks about the 1970s feminist consciousness raising movement, and how it impacted the lives of those who were involved. The book was written during the 1980s doldrums when women's activism had faded for many. However, individual women were feeling isolated and wishing for a rebirth of female community.Today, the Internet has become the means of communication for developing women's communities that are not limited by geography. This book is a guide to leading a women's group with goals of personal insight and life enhancement. The assumption is that, once we understand ourselves, we can then move outwards and impact the world around us. Good reading."
4,Bahco vs Snap On equivalent,The Bahco is made with less polish and the jaws are not serrated like the Sn p On adjustable. The upside is it appears to be made using the same design as the Snap n.If you are a home owner or need a wrench for your road box then the Bahco is the one for you. If it is to be your 1st line tool I can't be sure simply because I have not owned it long enough.This tool was a pleasant surprise. I expected something junky. My big fear is If it breaks. Time will tell!
2,"Not extra firm, but firm enough.","Good basic firm pillow. Not ""extra"" firm, but firm. Too much trouble to return."
3,A Historic Who Done it,"War creates many kinds of victims, the fallen soldier, the loved ones of the fallen and the soldiers who survive. Smith does a believable job of interweaving past war crimes with current ones, illustrating that in any war everyone's life is affected in some way.Born during WWII our heroine starts on a journey of discovering who her mother and father really are since as a researcher the facts aren't matching. Her world is shaken when there is a possibility that she maybe the daughter of a Nazi war criminal. Forgiving a mother, who has emotionally abused her, comes to a head when her mother is murdered in a remote town in Minnesota. A FBI agent assigned to the case uncovers clues that are shocking as well as disturbing to our heroine and yet relieving when the truth is finally aired. Lots of historic facts make this an interesting read."
3,Math and sugar make learning fun???,"I read this book to a group of children ranging from 5 to 8 and they all got a kick out of it. Maybe just from the anticipation of eating the M&M's. This book flows as a poem with colorful M&M's on each page. Math lessons include addition, subtration, division and multiplication. Some of the concepts was dificult for the kids to grasp because of the little detail conveyed in the text. But when it said to eat them they understood completly. This was one of the ways that I learned to count, you don't need this book to to do these activities. Don't let the colorful cover fool you. You can be much more creative with a bag of M&M's."
5,From a School Librarian,"Within its spare text and quiet illustrations lies the powerful message of teaching a child to appreciate the simple things in life through a parent's unselfish love. This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. Perhaps it's because I recently became a mom that this book touches me so deeply - but I can't read it without getting teary eyed. Not really a book I would use as a class read aloud, but a book that I would recommend to students to check out and share with parents at home. I plan to buy a copy for my library, my daughter and as a gift for everyone I know with kids. It's that good."
3,Very good - but,"The book is very thorough, like Cliff Notes on steroids, but it would be much more useful if they had included the short story. I realize that their would have been financial issues with publishing rights, and what do I expect for my four bucks, but I was still disappointed."
1,Spend a little more and get yourself a decent step...not worth it!,"I bought this product for my step aerobics class. I chose this itembecause it was more cheaply priced than some of the other stepsoffered, but wish I had spent the extra money on one of the moreexpensive models. For one thing, this step is too narrow. A widerone is easier to navigate. The extra risers don't fit properly and keepfalling off (once on my foot...ouch!) so I don't even bother with them.Also the plastic risers attached to the step are very slippery, so Ihave to put my yoga mat underneath it so I won't go sliding acrossthe room. Overall, I was disappointed in this product and wish I spenta little more and received better quality."
4,Let's Start Stepping!,"The step works fine, I just wish it was a little bit wider like the one I had before."
1,don't waste your money,"Like I sad, don't waste you money, it's cheap, but no good. It is very small. I bought it for the price and 2 weeks later was forced to buy a normal Step with risers for about 100$. In the end it cost me more."
3,stepper,For the price it does a good job. I have it on carpet and it stays put. The only problem I had was putting the height adjustment blocks on. Not a real good fit. Have to work at it a little.
2,Big mistake,Maybe next time someone gets the bright idea of playing around with dangerous and unpredictable predators they'll think twice and bring a gun.
3,Brief note: author mauled to death by brown bear,The author of this book was mauled to death on 8 Oct 2003 by a brown bear in Katmai National Park.
3,"well, so much for that.",while his purpose may have been true let his demise be a lesson to all. wild animals are wild and should be treated with the respect they demand. man's hubris knows no ends.
2,"Unscientific and misleading. Fittingly, killed by a Grizzly.","Although his accounts were entertaining, Treadwell was ultimately a fool who anthropomorphized a beautiful, but truly dangerous creature. I say WAS a fool because he was eaten by Grizzlies along with his girlfriend while camping among them. This book best serves as a warning to people who romanticize nature to the point that they lose respect for its true dangers.Go ahead and ejoy grizzlies, but bring a gun, just in case."
1,Maybe the methods and ideas should be revisited,Well now we know what can happen when people push bears too closely. The warm fuzzy feel good folks ended up dead and the bears ended up dead. This is what happens when common sense takes a back seat.
1,He may have,"Timothy Treadwell finally got his wish and was eaten by bears yesterday. Unfortunately, a woman who trusted him to have some knowledge of wildlife and two Katmai Grizzlies also lost their lives because of this sick man's foolish behavior. If you see my review of this book also posted here and dated August 27, 1997, you will see that Treadwell's death was entirely predictable by anyone with even a minimum of understanding of bears, the only question being how the National Park Service could have allowed this garbage in the name of science to go on for as long as it did.This man and his book were pathetic in a very literal sense of the word. I am truly sorry to have been so right in this case."
1,"""expert"" is the main course.....","Having casually followed the author's ""works"" for some time, it doesn't come as much of a surprise how this ""expert's"" life ended. I once saw him at a local university and while he had the whole student body captivated and conned, there was something uneasy about the way this ""expert"" kept espousing his world-view against hunters, the government and yes - everyday men and women who are too ignorant and violent to ""understand"" his beloved, peaceful bears. Typical environmental elitist arrogance. I only feel sorry for the poor woman he duped into coming along with him on that ill-fated trip and the two bears killed later by the park rangers."
2,Book indirectly promotes irresponsible behavior!,"Come on now people. It doesn't take a genius to know that a bear is a wild, often unpredictable animal that has, and will attack (and kill!) humans at times when hungry enough or when encroached in its territory! DUH!!! Treadwell had to have known this, but yet ignored this simple reality. Now, two humans are dead as well as two bears. What a waste. While I applaud Tim's love of nature and respect for animals, I fail to see or understand how he deluded himself into thinking all this would turn out OK."
1,Among Grizzlies,"This book is terrible!! It's the same thing over and over. Treadwell names his bears and gives you the same boaring synopsis of their days events; digging clams, waking him up during the night, etc. And let's not forget about ""Timmy the Fox!!"" It's more exciting reiterating my pet hamsters daily schedule!! You would be better off reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Don't waste your money."
5,It's proven . . human's are the worst animal on earth.,". . . this book is a landmark in the battle of getting humans to realize that they are by far the worst animal on earth . . .when Flip Nicklin swam with wild Killer Whales we realized that they are not so bad . . and now someone has had the guts to live with grizzlies and lived to tell about it. It made me appreciate the guts it takes my cats to live with me, a much bigger and more powerful animal and I believe that this book will spark much controversy in the scientific and governmental communities who have always told us how to interact with animals. I think Timmothy Treadwell's book took more guts than the fact of his living in the wild with bears in some respects and I hope for his sake that we never make the bear a warm fuzzy because of it but rather people reevaluate our relationships with all animals"
1,A great book .....for Walt Disney.,"I think Timothy Treadwells' heart is in the right place, but I feel his grasp on reality has been altered by his past history of self abuse. I started to read his book with the best of intentions but after a few pages, I really started to doubt this guys sanity. There is no way a person so totally unfamiliar with bears could have survived so many chance encounters and walk away without so much as a scratch. Sorry dude, but I think childrens books might be a better literary choice for your story telling abilities."
3,It would be ironic if it weren't so logical.,"It's hard to read this book without thinking about the horrible way Treadwell died. Truly, this is a cautionary tale against the romantic notions some people seem to have about nature."
1,Eaten by a grizzly,"Timothy Treadwell, the author of this stunningly misguided book, was killed in early October 2003 while visiting his ""friendly"" buddies, the grizzlies, in Alaska's Katmai National Park and Preserve. He was 46 years old. What irony! In spite of the theme of this book, it is very unwise to play with wild bears. Do not give this book to impressionable youngsters."
3,Tim Treadwell is dead,"Considering that Treadwell and his girlfriend are now dead, mauled by a bear, I would say that his methods and philosophy deserve some revisiting. No disrespect intended."
1,Man Eaten -- Black Angus No Longer a Suspect,"This dude got eaten by one of the bears. Maybe it was Cuddles or BooBoo or Hannibal Lecter. He missed the point. THESE ARE WILD ANIMALS AND SHOULD BE RESPECTED AS SUCH. We are in charge because we can use tools, like rocks, spears, knives, and large calibre handguns. It's the Wilderness, not Jellystone Park."
5,Doing what he's passionate about.....,"Timothy Treadwell has realized his passion in life and has decided to take on the feat of not only educating himself, but the world around him. This is not a children's book nor an encylopedia. This is this story of a man who struggled to find his purpose, found it, and now wants to help others understand it.I have never been an animal advocate until now. Timothy's beautiful narration of his adventures to the Grizzly Sanctuary have helped me to better understand the horrible turmoils of another species. His stories of Booble, Mr. Chocolate, and Timmy the Fox are those that convey the complexity of the wild and its' relationship with man. This book is meant to educate the layman through incredible photography and narration.I highly reccomend this book to anyone with even a slight interest in grizzlies. The information is compelling and informational. Kudos to Timothy for telling his story through photography, scientific information, and beautiful narration."
3,Never read the book,Never read the book but read the reviews and tend to agree with the first review talking about his lack of scientific prowess and leaning towards suicidal. He and his girlfriend were just mauled to death by one of the so called bears he wanted to kiss on the nose. Looks like he got too close and got his death wish granted.
1,What are the underpinnings behind this madness?,"Having recently read this book, I want to ascertain the unstated assumptions driving these people to their worldview (and in the case of Treadwell, his death). As best I can determine, the Grizzly People cult believe this:1. If you believe that people, bears, ducks, etc., ought to love each other, love is guaranteed;2. If you talk enough about peace, you'll get it;3. There are no such things as enemies (or predators), just friends we haven't apologized to.Notwithstanding the tragedy of his death, I am heartened that darwinian effects invariably removed Treadwell's genes from the pool."
1,Eaten by Grizzlies,"Today, he got eaten by wild bears in Alaska. Search CNN.com. Enough said regarding this silliness."
3,Hungry Bear,"Notwithstanding all of the late Mr. Treadwell's ""scientific"" research, he failed to recognize one important principle, ""Survival of the Fittest."" A hungry bear needs to eat. These bears spend this time of year where there are lots of fish and thus are generally happy, well fed, satisfied bears. But, if the Alaska State Troopers are correct, and he was killed by a old bear with bad teeth, then that bear was likely no longer sucessfully ""fishing."" Younger bears were competing more effectively and this old fellow was not able to get his fill of fish. Mr. Treadwell, and unfortunately, Ms. Huguenard were easy pickings. These two souls were an easy meal for a hungry old bear."
4,"He went where no man has gone before, RIP my friend","I know that Timothy had his problems but I just admire the way he escaped alcoholism and a miserable life and most likely death in the concrete jungles we call cities and found his own personal paradise and happiness living in nature. He integrated himself succesfully in a community of bears and he did this for 13 years, no one gets lucky for 13 years straight, the man was obviously onto something.He knew all the risks very well and he assumed them, he had no delusions there, he knew that what he was doing was a high risk activity and that the bears could kill him.We shouldn't berate him more than we should berate a surfer who drowned or who was eaten by a shark, a climber who fell or froze to death etc.Timothy was a lot like Steve the Crocodile Hunter who died killed by a stingray fish while doing what he loved most.We should all understand that these are high risk activities and people die sometimes. RIP Timothy and God Bless."
3,Entertaining but silly,"About halfway through this book, I thought to myself, ""Is this guy for real""? It was inspiring how Timothy Treadwell pulled himself out of a life of heavy drug use and dedicated himself to the preservation of bears, but the book was just down right ridiculous at times. If you love bears then get this book, but if you want to preserve bears and yourself, never act like Timothy Treadwell when you are around them."
3,Wow,"I must say what an incredibly misguided fool. An excellent review here states how this book is basically about a guy attempting suicide. I think that reviewer was right on the money. I have seen a picture of a human body shredded by a grizzly; not a pretty site. There is just an incredible amount of literature out there that plainly shows humans must be very cautious around grizzlies. If there is something about the way you smell that fools the grizzly into thinking you are a good meal, well, just hope that doesn't happen. And a major national news outlet called this guy a ""bear expert""? sheesh."
1,Worst book i have ever read,"I made it to page 40, then i had to give up. Stay away! This is like a book written by a five year old child. If you are curious about T. Treadwell buy The grizzly maze by Nick Jans instead."
1,Dangerously naive self-absorption disguised as a nature book,"After reading the book and seeing the author and his footage of harassing bears on talk shows, this irresponsible behavior needs a lengthy disclaimer. The publisher should be ashamed of encouraging grizzley/human interactions. The griz deserves much more respect."
2,Doctor Dolittle Meets Dian Fossey,"An admitted alcoholic and drug addict with a life-long affinity for grizzly bears, Treadwell decides to live among them, or to be more precise, to try to become one.Yep. He packs his bags for Alaska each summer and communes with his friends the grizzlies. We meet them: Booble, Hefty, Cupcake, Beacon and, his favorite, Mr. Chocolate, to name a few. He can talk to them, undertstand their behavior by analysizing their droppings (which smell like fresh-cut grass, he says), and keep them from attacking by singing songs."
3,Mediocracy...just like his life,"I just finished reading the book by Timothy. At first, I got a better look at his life and why he traveled to Alaska to live with these ""brown"" bears, not ""grizzlies"" as he liked to think they were. After finishing the book I felt some sympathy for him. Then I moved on and read Nick Jans' book about Timothy and this factual book made me do a complete 180. Not that I have hard feelings for Tim, I just don't agree with what he did..."
4,"Soft plastic, notch doesn't match too well","Generic product. Despite its for something 10+ years old, the merchandise is in good condition. The notch to align it to the intake and MAF is a little off but I didn't bother to cut it. Later found better deal on yee babe but too late..."
4,They need to change the mugs,"Love the plates, saucers etc - unfortunately the mugs are made from a different material altogether. The box should advertise as much, the mugs are crap, they chip, they hold water in the dishwasher - they should not be included in this package with the same quality plates."
4,Good Product - Picture incorrect,"Overall my family likes these dishes so far. We knew what to expect from Correlle and we really like the pattern. The following things aren't bad, just something to be aware of (all of which I had done extra research on so I knew ahead of time)1. The pattern doesn't look true red in real life like it does on the picture. It's got more muted tones of deeper maroon and pinkish hues. Viewed from a distance it's true red, up close- mostly red""ish"". 2. The picture on amazon shows 5 pieces per place setting. I had this with my last set of dishes and liked it. However, the description explains there are only 4 pieces per place setting. Still fine, but misleading through the picture. You get the pieces described - no ""luncheon plate"" as pictured. 3. We had one piece in teh set where the pattern on the dinner plate was slightly off center, not a huge deal to us and not very obvious (my husband didn't notice until I pointed it out. All in all, a good value."
5,Unbreakable,These dishes are great. They are microwave and dishwasher safe. My husband even dropped a plate on the cement on our back patio and it didn't break.
2,Some bowls have chipped,I love the Gypsum design and ordered two sets a few years ago. Since then three of the bowls have chipped around the edges. It's a real shame since they've gotten light duty and have never been dropped. Just chipped from being in the dishwasher which is unacceptable.
5,Great for Everyday Use!,"I was a little skeptical ordering these dishes, but decided to go ahead anyway and I am glad I did!! They are very attractive, sturdy and stack beautifully in the cabinet. A huge bonus for me is that they are light weight and a breeze for the kids to handle. I probably would not use these to entertain, but they are great for everyday!!"
5,Good dining set,"I love Corelle, I don't panic every time my kids set the table. I am very pleased with the pattern. In fact, I think it looks better up close than in the picture on-line. My only disappointment is that I wanted to get matching teacups and saucers and I don't believe they have that."
4,Nice hose kit,"I bought this hose more for function than for looks, tho it looks pretty good. Have been having a few vapor lock issues when the weather is very hot, and hoped the stainless mesh over the rubber hose would help with the heat. so far, so good."
5,_The_ Authoritative Reference,"For most chemical applications, this book is an invaluable resource for accurate and complete physical data on most common reagents. While it is a bit irrelevant (and perhaps a bit costly) for home/casual use, it is absolutely essential in a lab/academic environment where such information is beneficial or a necessity on a day to day basis. Polished, neat, and comprehensive, it conveys an enormous amount of data in an understandable and easily looked up format."
1,Let the buyer beware!,"Don't be fooled -- this album makes itself sound like a compilation, but it's all covers, and fairly lackluster ones at that. Sleazy and blatant false advertising."
1,Music You Know by People You Don't Know,Even the kiddies will wonder why the music sounded better on the radio. Spend a few dollars more and get the genuine article. The Ultimate Dance series is a good choice.
2,Buck 757,"The ax appears to be built very strong. The quality of the edge, however, is the worse I have ever seen. A butter knife has a sharper edge. The edge is coated with what appears to be a paint or coating the consistency of hard plastic. When I attempted to sharpen it with a stone, the coating fouled the sharpening stone to the degree of almost ruining the stone. I had to use a bastard file to cut through the coating to the metal and achieve some sort of an edge. Only then could I put an edge on the blade. The ax is totally useless unless the aformentioned process is done. This is ridiculous. There are better axes out there that come ready to use. This is disappointing to see in a Buck product."
1,Doesn't chop well at all,"I was very dissatisfied with this axe. It is so dull, you can't cut butter."
2,Wooden Table and Chairs,It is sturdy for children but the paint is chipping off already and they have just had it since Christmas so I am not happy at all about that. It already looks like it is at least 2 years old!!!!!
3,perfect toddler table for the price!,"This was purchased for my 2 year old son and he loves sitting in the chairs (which are the perfect size for him) and doing activities (or eating) at his little table. The chairs are pretty sturdy, but the table is a bit flimsy. The legs of the table can be reinforced at the joints, especially if your toddler likes to climb up on things. Other than that, it was a great deal and it is used everyday for eating dinner and activity-time."
2,Major Flaws,Not to impressed with this company. 3rd item I have bought and the table top had to be reglued and screwed. Also the table top had major horizontal cracks. I don't believe they check their quality of their products.
4,Good value,"It was easy to assemble. And lightweight. The quality of ply is poor but the price is also low. The paint quality is decent. The quality of screws were not so great. So, be careful when you are tightening.Overall, a decent kid's table for a decent price."
4,Wooden chairs & table.,Granddaughter enjoys. We placed in our family room and the table and chairs fit in great. Price was reasonable.
3,Pretty good buy,I had to have a second set shipped since the first one arrived damaged. That went very smooth--Amazon was great. The table and chairs were a little of a disappointment since the description said wood. I thought that meant solid wood. The chairs are but the table top is not. Even the second shipment had a little damage on the corners of the table. I decided not to bother with a second return. Wasn't really packed very well. For the money though all in all it was a pretty good buy and the grandkids will get a lot of use out of it
3,you need tool to fix,"the mounting holes did not line up and screw holes did line up had to drill new holes, but it had a good finnish on it"
3,"Colorful, but you better add additional support","The first thing a kid probably thinks when seeing this product is jumping into the seats and going right to work. The colors make it look like fun. We've had several young children over and none of them could resist parking themselves in and enjoying themselves.However, my first thought was a concern for any child's safety who sits in it. These are not the most stable table out there, but you get what you pay for. While putting these together I've added some additional supports to make sure they don't topple over and hurt a kid. I would advise you to do the same. One of the tables wouldn't even come together properly without two trips to Home Depot for some extra support.Kids love this, but be aware of its quality. I'm surprised products like this are sold in the condition they come in."
1,disaster,"This was a disaster before I even opened the box hardware was falling out of the box,did open the box on Christmas Eve to put together for my son and it looks like he has had it for 10 years the table has a piece completly broken off,one corner is bent completly over,the paint on all the pieces are is worn and missing hardware,very dissapionted in this product and company will never order any thing from Beck again I should have looked at it before Christmas Eve but was trying to keep it out of sight now it looks like I am going to be scrambling around on Christmas Eve trying to find a replacement if there was a way to rate this with no stars I would have"
4,Very nice for the price,"I love the look of the table, its gorgeous. However, some of the legs are uneven, so we are having to be creative with spacers to even it out. If I paid more than $40 I would be upset at this, but for free shipping and $35 bucks - its beautiful and worth the extra effort."
1,Had missing parts /Size was misrepresented,This was the worst product I have ever received from amazon. This product had pieces missing and could not be put together. The size was not represented correctly. Overall I was very disappointed.
2,Looks great but poor quality,When I saw this I decided to buy in a second. It is made up of cheap quality wood. Its paint was coming off at the moment when it comes but due to appearence my 1 and 2 yrs old daughters loves it. I would not recommend this to buy.
3,Nice reflection,Ruby's recollections are delightful. A little tough to keep the attention of small children but still an important experience to share. It was a delight to have it signed as a recent opportunity presented itself to her her speak live.
3,Did not work with my keyboard,"Despite what the Amazon web site says, this does not fit the Casio WK-1200. I had to return it. The return was easy."
4,Does what it claims,The plug works well.The keyboard hasn't had any power problems since I started using the adapter.
5,Works like a charm!,"Got this as a replacement for my WK-1250 keyboard that got chewed up by our pet rabbit. Works like a charm! The actual item is not as displayed as others have mentioned, but personally I hate the ""wall warts"" as the sample photo shows it, so really happy there. The actual power supply is more akin to one you'd find with a laptop: long AC cord plugged into the transformer, with a smaller DC cord plugging into the keyboard.Thumbs up!"
3,JAM WHAT NOT AM,JAM IS GOOD BUT DOESN'T HAVE THE PUNGENCY THAT I CRAVE AND WHAT I HAD IN DEUTCHLAND.
4,A Good Start,"As a college student working towards a degree in Nutrition, my food tends to be one of my biggest expenses. Coupons can help cut down on that, but only if used consistently. THis nifty little organizer sticks right to my microfridge and help keeps all my coupons handy. I keep my grocery list pinned up next to it, and look for coupons for each item as I add them to the list. So far I love it, and the extra few dollars a week definitely build up.My only gripe is that the organizer cards that come with it could have perhaps been better chosen. There's one for ""Cleaning and Paper"" and one for ""Frozen Foods"", yet no card for produce or ""Fruits/Vegetables""? I was a little disappointed. Had there been that one extra card to cover my coupons for squash and broccoli, I'd have awarded it 5 stars."
2,Chinese Glue,"One of the 3 I have held up well. The other 2 boxes fell off their magnetic sheet within a couple of days. One of them was empty, it fell apart under it's own weight. I fixed them with Gorila glue."
2,"Amplifer works OK, build quality poor","The amplifier works as advertised fairly, but the build quality is poor. The connector for the power plug broke after only four months of use. I took it apart to investigate and found that the power connection to the circuit board is very light duty. The process of simply pluging it in and unplugging it caused it to break. My previous Wilson amplifier had a much stronger connection to the circuit board. It worked for years and was subjected to the same type of use. Like other Wilson products I've used over the years, the quality seems to be in decline."
5,WIlson 811210 Dual Band Cell Phone Booster,"Outstanding product, live on the fringe of cell coverage, purchased WILSON 811210 and the trucker antenna with a base mount for the house (outside antenna), and Wilson antenna for (internal antenna). W O W !!! Cell phone reception bars went from 0/1 to 4/5 bars. Stopped the frequent dropping of calls too. Wish I purchased the Wilson 811210 and trucker antenna earlier, worth every penny."
3,Signal booster for truck laptop,"Even thought I rarely venture far from any city limit, my Verizon Wireless card for my truck laptop has always stuggled for a signal when it should have been a strong, quick signal. So I did lots of research before investing in this product to be sure the problem would be solved.Most of the reviews stated that signal reception improved vastly, or that people were now recieving 4G service. However, sometimes it still takes several minutes to get a signal and those occasional ""lost signals"" are still a problem. I fail to understand why since I'm using Verizon's top of the line card and a MacBook Pro. No doubt, this booster has increased the speed and was worth the money to get it, but don't expect high speed internet access within seconds as you would with a good home router and decent computer."
5,Does as it says,"We put this in an ambulance because my service switched to Samsung Rugby flip phones. We already had a cell phone antenna on top of the ambulance, so installation was easy. The phone keeps full bars most of the time now and we haven't had a dropped call in a month now."
2,Feeling Inept,"I should have done more research before making the purchase. I can't say whether the starter works or not. I consider myself pretty ""techie"" and able to figure out most anything given the information needed. So, I purchased this item expecting the programming to be pretty straightforward. Boy! Was I wrong.I found the manufacturer's website, then, to get help or, at least, more detailed instructions but their site is a waste of time. Apparently, they cater to dealers and professional installers, not ""do-it-yourself-ers.""Normally, I try to be a very positive person but this product is sitting in a drawer now; and I'd like to save someone else from the same experience."
5,Saved $60,"Bought this remote but wasn't sure if it would work, it came on time programmed it in 5 minutes and saved myself $60 by not going to an auto alarm shop."
2,Didn't work for us,"While this product arrived in good time and in good shape, we could not get it programmed to work with our car, despite it's being listed as the replacement transmitter. We called the 800 number and tried everything that we were told to do (including going into the dashboard), but it simply would not match the system that came on our vehicle. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I believe the fault lay with our system, but the product said it was the replacement (and looks exactly the same); however, since it did not work, amazon paid for the return postage, so it cost us nothing but time and frustration. Another transmitter we got several months ago for a different vehicle worked perfectly, so I would not say not to try this - just know that it may not work for you."
5,excellent fast paced thriller with offbeat characters,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer from Baltimore, preceding me. This novel has a wonderful fast paced plot with lots of unexpected events along the way. The characters are multidimensional and although most of them are quite offbeat, they come off as being real and not just caricatures. This book is a fast, entertaining, hard-to-put-down read and I'd highly recommend it."
3,A lot of fun but a little cliched. Tense ending.,"Some fast-moving action and chain-of-event occurences here. Hodge's pace is crisp. I liked his characters because of their oddities, but they were somewhat cliched (the dumb bad guy and female villain who's the ""real"" boss, for example). There is no ""real story"" or resolution though--it's just a plain old chase novel. The ending is tense and fulfilling--not your traditional Hollywood fare. Mixing humor with action seems to be Hodge's strength; finding any sort of meaning beyond the surface, his weakness (if it is one). Worth your time if you like odd folks and action."
3,At Home with Carolyne Roehm,"This book should have been called ""Entertaining with CR"" or "" CR's Table"". It is a great book in entertainment for every season. This is not a book about home. I am a big fan of Ms. Roehm. I have purchased all of her books and extra copies to give as gifts. All her books make beautiful gifts (including this one). The title of this book is misleading. I had expected to see Home Decorating Ideas including furniture and accessories. The closest description to a home is a Carriage House. ""A Passion for Flowers"" had beautiful pictures of her apartment in Paris and what used to be Weatherstone. I had expected to see more of these. The book mentions that these 2 homes no longer existed at the time the book was written. If not for the misleading title, Ms. Roehm's talents in entertaining and table decorating make this a beautiful book."
1,Not on Par,"The publication of this book was delayed for 1 year and I was in torture loving Carolyn's other books as I do. To say I was disappointed when it finally arrived is being kind! When I want recipes for great food I go to Martha but from Carolyn I expect recipes for living a VISUALLY beautiful upscale life involving interiors and flowers. With this book (really more of a cookbook and she has a COOK), she ""dumbed down"" for the Shabby Chic crowd and Martharized her offering for the rest of the public. My eyes teared over A Passion for Flowers. I put this one on the shelf and never looked at it again. I rate all her other books 5+ each!"
5,Caroline Roehm Inspires!,"I saw this book for the first time on Oprah and was very impressed with Caroline's ideas. When I saw the book I was completely dazzled. I am an author and an illustrator, and just looking at these pages makes me want to start painting! Fabulous."
5,Rock Discipline - John Petrucci,"This video is a must for any guitar player whishing to improve their technique. It covers everything from warming up to sweep picking to sub-dividing the beat and also how to increase your speed. This is not a video of ""hey look at me show off"" like other videos I've seen, and it also covers areas like compositional writing and how to improve standard chord progressions. There are demonstrations of the examples and the video is better than any other book or video that I have ever seen on improving your technique. If you think that this video would just be on shredding then you are very much mistaken. This video shows you how good John Petrucci really is, and he is fantastic. He is, in my mind, joint 1st place with Steve Vai. I recommend everyone to check this video out and also his band Dream Theater. It really is that good."
4,Great Pointers from the Man Himself,"John Petrucci shows off his jaw dropping speed, but more importantly, how to acheive it. He breaks down the video to focus on different aspects of technique: legato (left hand), alternate picking, the glorious sweep picking, as well as important overlooked concepts, such as stretching and warming up. Petrucci also gives a little insight into himself; he discusses his influences, approaches toward songwriting and band situations, and at the end, he gives a little tour of his rig (from the Awake era). This video is definitely an A+. This video definitely shows the benefits of a good practice regimen, and each exercise concentrates on important (and often overlooked) aspects of technique."
5,A SONGWRITING TREASURE,"Betty Elders work in general, and her two latest albums in particular (of which this is the newest) are some of the finest examples of contemporary songwriting available. She has a wonderful voice, crafts some of the most beautiful arrangements around her songs, and has a unique way of opening her heart to her audience through her art that is rare in a business that is so full of shallowness. From the first words of 'The long night', the listener is pulled in, aware that something very special has been gifted here. This is music to envelop the heart and soul, music to heal, music to treasure. Some of Austin's finest musicians add their tasteful touches to complete the package. Also recommended: her previous cd, PEACEFUL EXISTENCE, which contains two songs covered in recent years by no less an icon than Joan Baez...."
4,fair enough,"These songs are simpler and more personal than some of Elder's previous work, and definately less political. Her piano work is missing, and most of the instrumentation is acoustic. Altogether a pleasant enough collection, but lacks a little of the pathos we've come to expect from this chanteuse of the common man."
3,Nice Pillow,"I have bought several of these pillows but they always tend to break down. The last might be to firm as I had to resort to the old one.I have degenerative disks in my neck and always have liked the support, however lately my neck is stiff upon waking. I rated this way because of the issues I may have personally."
5,what music should be!!!,"The blending of styles on this album is wonderful. Polka, Waltz, Rock, hints of psychedelic, folk, and other euro-centric sounds (think Camper Van Beethoven, but more German). The lyrics are mostly in German, Red Sonja alternates between English (provided by Dave Lowery) and German and ""Dr. Bernice"" is an early version of a Cracker classic. The album is fun, but not overly quirky... very intelligent and interesting work that will make you want to learn how to dance to German music."
1,No English cross reference,This book is ineffectual. There is no way to look up an English language verb and find its translation. What's the point?
5,This is TRUE New York deep house.....,"Being born and raised in New York, and then moving to California, it has been very difficult for me to find that true house sound. This cd has smooth and deep house, and the modern jazz adds a touch of that New York class. To me, this music has depth and soul. I hope to hear more like this in the future."
5,"Mellow, smooth, excellent","I'm from Chicago and grew up listening to the house sounds of Mr. Fingers, Lil Louis, and Farley Funk. Since I've been in LA, I can't find music with the original house sound. I initially heard a portion of New York Afterhours in a coffee bar and immediately tracked down a manager to find out who the DJ was. This mix was so good that I was willing to pay the DJ to put me a mix together. When I found out it was on a disc, I had a friend of mine in New York find the disc for me and mail it to me. If you like house with a touch of a jazz, this is the disc you want."
5,EXCELLENT RESOURCE,Purchased to have children who participated in a 3 day educational venture in the everglades donate to the library at the Everglades. Book very informative to children (grade 5) and as additional resource on premises.
5,A Must Read!,"I first read Oberdorfer's book in 1997, not long after it came out and in the midst of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Having lived in South Korea since 1990, I found his analysis of the two Koreas a must read for anyone interested in Northeast Asia.Jeffrey Miller, author ofWar Remainsa Korean War novel."
3,"Readable, But Questionable","This book was pretty readable, however I did have a couple of issues. The biggest problem I had was that it jumped around chronologically. It would appear to be relating events sequentially, then jump back and add an event years prior that would seem to have been too important to skip the first time. This was both confusing and irritating. It also left out alot of significant events. For example, it only mentioned the Pueblo incudent in one sentence in the entire book. It did not explore the event at all. It also did not touch on defections of US servicemembers to the North. And it barely referenced the North's kidnappings of Japanese in the 70's. Also, some event details were erroneous when compared to other books I've read on the same subject. This book seemed heavily subjective/opinion-based in alot of areas. Not my favorite book on the subject."
4,Best Read for Big Picture Understanding of Korean Politics,"Oberdorfer's account of the historical, political, and cultural perspectives on the Korean peninsula are extremely well framed for both foreign policy experts and laymen.If you have an interest in the Korean Peninsula -- business person, servicemember, diplomat, student -- I strongly recommend this book as an effective tool in establishing a solid baseline for further study and analysis or if you only want to get a ""scratch the surface"" understanding of Korea.Additionally, Oberdorfer has written an effective and readable work rather than simply a pedantic academic dissertation."
5,Churchill does it again!,"Though I typically don't read historical mysteries, I picked this one up solely because I've loved all of Churchill's other novels. This one is definitely worth the read. The characters are realistic and the plot intriguing! Jill Churchill has done it again!"
4,Fun little mystery,"For light mystery reading: Premise is that rich and spoiled brother & sister, left destitute after the market crash of the late 20's, get a second chance when great-uncle dies and leaves them his home. Strings are attached to the deal. Also, they discover that great-uncle's death might not have been an accident. Investigation follows.Really, really appreciate this book because it's a no-smut whodunit.Historical events and attitudes of that time are well represented."
5,Very Enjoyable Read!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The author was very true to the time period and dropping the vernacular of the day and other bits social commentary added to the book. I hope she writes more of these kind of books. I am a big S. S. Van Dine fan, and I know Philo Vance would like her very much."
3,ELUSIVE BALL PROGRAMMER.,"This hard-to-find-on-video 1939 film, which features Lucille Ball in the lead, is unusual Lucy fare. Lucy plays Jean Russell, an honest, hard-working gal who's jilted by her money-hungry beau, played by the Errol Flynn-like Patric Knowles. Once Lucy invents an exclusive beauty cream - which makes her a financially successful businesswoman - Knowles comes back to her crawling on his knees...A strangely watchable offbeat programmer with an interesting (though probably unintentioned) feminist viewpoint coupled with a good early Ball performance (this is a serious role) make for an interesting 68 minutes. It is rumoured that an incredible total of 5 writers collaborated on the script; the result is a fair screenplay, however."
5,Great for beginning/intermediate fingerstyle players who want to learn Celtic tunes,"I have learned about half the tunes in this book and I am enjoying it immensely. Many of the songs have easy and then more difficult passages, making it possible to match parts, or all, or each tune to the player's ability. What a great value, considering the purchase price and the many hours of learning, fun and satisfaction! The tablature is clearly written, with an accompanying CD for those who like to learn by ear as well as by tab. I highly recommend this book for beginning/intermediate fingerstyle players who want to explore Celtic tunes."
5,Excellent Beginner book,This is an excellent book for beginners. I got this book because I was just starting but I wanted to play some real songs that weren't just the boring melody lines and this is really great for that!! I could read notes but I wanted to learn how to read tab because it is easier to read much quicker than standard notation for the guitar and the tab in this book was written really well and easy to read.
4,Far Away - an average single,"The song Far Away is one of the best songs from Duty. For me, I took quite a while to enjoy this song. It will grow on you for sure. Ayu's vocals were far beyond excellent at this stage of her carieer.The Original Mix is the best version of the song, the remixes are all okey but they do not suprise you. I think that the ""appears - Junior's Club mix"" is a very good remix from this single. Other nice tracks are ""End roll - da urban maesto mix"", ""Far away - HAL's mix 2000"" and my personal favourite ""Far away - Dub's Mute & Feedback remix"".Overall, this is an average singer from the worlds most amazing artist. If you are a big Ayu fan, you'll enjoy this release. If you are new to her music, you might go and get something else.."
1,Received wrong product awaiting correct one,I order the juicer but received the processor instead- sent it back but have still not received the juicer.When I receive the juicer I will let you know if it works.
5,Not Your Usual Novelty Street Sign,"This is a first-rate street sign. Put it up in your dorm room and, I guarantee, no one else on campus will have one jsut like it. Great conversation stopper!!"
4,"Brilliant, but...","I had been meaning to read this for years, as I lived through the period it covers and remember that world all too well. It is brilliantly written, no question. But one's reaction to it will depend on how fondly one recalls that era. Having lived through experiences all too similar to the protagonist's, I found it harrowing. The main character's self-destructive idealism is hard to take, particularly as he learns nothing from his experiences. Time after time I wanted to scream at him: ""Wake up! You are being used!"" But he remains as hopelessly obsessed at the end as ever. Who wants to identify with a hero who refuses to grow?I would have liked the book more if it had been a broader picture of that pivotal moment in history, and less focussed on it's massively irritating main character."
1,Big Snooze,"Personally, I couldn't get in to it; I love gay novels, even more so I love gay novels that take place in San Francisco, and even more so gay novels that take place in san frantic during the golden year's period. I loved all of Armistead Maupin's novels and couldn't get enough of them; however I literally had to force myself to keep reading and finally gave up 3/4 into it. I have to say that I was really disappointed especially with the raving reviews the book seems to be getting here. The book simply seems to be all over the place, and focusing too often on meaningless details for chapters at a time."
3,Good Value- Though a Bit Cheap Feeling,"As advertised, this product atomizes liquid for application. We purchased several, and found the spray pattern to be a bit unpredictable at best. The cap is chromed plastic, and the overall quality is fairly low. If you go into is knowing this- you'll be fine.Conclusion:Fine product, fine price"
3,"Interesting, but much more could have been done","If you are seeking fascinating history and a well researched book, try this one. However, as the previous reader mentions, the book is not well written and it would have been nice to see his sources."
2,Not a good effort,"This book is a disappointment. It is not a serious work of scholorship. It has no notes, no index and is written in a rather breathless style that involves lots of exclamation marks and purported quotations of conversations that took place 75 years ago. The work also lacks structure and needed a good editor.Save your money."
3,asking for thorough research,Devil's Island was originally published circa 1934. It told of Dr Dreyfus'ordeal. The book you are listing is 1988. Is that an update of the original Devil's Island?
1,Offering a reprint of titles not even 2 years old,"The stories by both authors are wonderful, I am a devoted fan of McNaught. I just find it upsetting - and a easy way to mislead people into spending money on something they've already read - to reprint stories that appeared one or maximum two years ago under a new title and cover. Anyone not careful is just going to see the new title and the authors names and will buy to be disappointed afterwards. I really don't like this approach - so I'm rating that and not the content which is very good."
5,Simply Enjoyable!,SIMPLE GIFTS is a delightful collection of short stories by beloved authors! Very Enjoyable!
3,Longer please,"I loved Corey, but found that the short story didn't allow the author to really develop the male character."
2,These authors are PROFESSIONALS???,"I love romance anthologies, and I know that Deveraux and McNaught are popular, well-known authors. I was very disappointed in the writing of these stories. The authors break or ignore all known writing rules that beginning writers are taught: in two of the stories, we don't meet either the hero or heroine for the first couple of pages. The first paragraphs of ""Double Exposure"" describe two women, Diana and Kristin, and yet NEITHER ONE is the heroine. Ditto for ""Change of Heart."" Also, none of the four stories were all that entertaining or uplifting, let alone wreathed in Christmas spirit. All in all, a disappointing 'effort' by otherwise well-known, successful authors."
3,"Light Beam is too Narrow,Good for close-up shots.","This is a good product for Close-ups,and it does not have a 20 foot range,the light beam is too narrow.This product needs a little more work,wider light beam and a better range or a greater coverage areaWBS"
1,Worthless,LED lights are not bright at all. Tried on two camaras using with and without. Photos are came out the same. Would not recommend
5,excellent buy,"wanted the charger as a temporary charger, but it has proven good for longer term. reasonable price, does the job. i have been happy with this purchase. shipping was fast."
3,Cheap but will it last?,"This is the 2nd car adapter I have purchased from this seller. The first one worked---for about 3 months. I am hoping it was defective. Received the new one and it is working great. Hopefully I will get more longevity out of this one.Edit: Well the 2rd and last adapter I purchased lasted almost a year, then broke for no reason. Honestly, it's such a pain to keep buying these that I am just going to shell out the money for a name-brand charger."
1,Not for Nokia N95,"Based on some limited research, I believed the N95 charger was the same as the N91 and N90. But either I was wrong, or this charger isn't sized properly. The power connector is very loose in the phone. It would charge it if I held it there or taped it on the phone.Plus the cigarette plug has two springy metal things that end up springing it out of my cigarette lighter receptacle..So all in all, neither end stays in the appropriate hole. I'm bummed out. Don't order this for your Nokia N95."
4,A Very Short Review,"As an alum of public schools in Chicago and Detroit, I had zero knowledge of the Spanish Civil War aside from the fact that it occurred. In a ""very short introduction"", Graham has given me enough to know what questions to begin to ask about this important period in the history of Western Civilization."
1,"Horrendous. Poorly written, wandering, and moralistic.","I usually enjoy the volumes in the VSI series from Oxford University Press, but this is a glaring exception. The author, as other reviewers have noted, seeks out less to provide a history of the conflict then to paint a ringing endorsement of the Spanish Republicans. As someone with very little background knowledge in the conflict, this bias is still glaringly obvious. In addition, the book is horrendously written, with random scatterings of text boxes, superfluous use of quotations to ridicule nationalist positions, and slapshod organization. I have turned instead to Antony Beevor's ""Spanish Civil War"", which, while in many ways sympathetic to the left (as I am myself) at least attempts to reach a nuanced understanding of the conflict. Negative stars."
3,Useful introduction,"Helen Graham provides a useful introduction to the Spanish Civil War. In the spirit of the OUP 'Very Short Introduction' series she packs in a wealth of academic detail, while still summarising the main processes of the war in brisk chapters. The bias, as other reviewers have commented, is strongly pro-Republican, and she is a touch blind to the disgusting game played by the Communists in the Spanish Civil War (events which turned George Orwell firmly off Communism at a time when many of his fellow travellers on the left were eulogising the Stalinist regime)."
2,Why can't historians write?,"I don't think the author got the concept of a an introduction. She should have not only summarized the events (which she did) but put them in readable prose, simplified so the unenlightened reader could grasp the subject easily. Isn't that the point of an intro? Instead, we get a book poorly written with deadening prose."
3,An Unbalanced Account,"There is some interesting material in this book, especially the chapter on the post-war period, but the account of the war reads as if it were written 30 years ago. It is strongly shaded to the Republican side (this has been the rare war in which history was written by the losers). Both the Church and the Nationalists are portrayed more negatively that the current state of research would justify. Anthony Beevor's excellent and more balanced account is not mentioned in the bibliography, nor is the important book by Stanley G. Payne on the involvement of the Soviet Union in the running of the war on the Republican side. The bibliography assumes reader cannot read Spanish, a language widely-known in the States. The author is obviously very familiar with the subject. I am sorry the book was not better."
2,"Helpful, but very tough to read","I just finished reading the book, and it was helpful because it provided a brief overview of not only the conflict, but also the ""new Spain"" that emerged in the postwar years. Unfortunately, the book was a tough read because it is very poorly written."
4,They Did,"You have to be in the right mood to see this story of a down and out Oscar nominee who has principles. He also has trouble raising his daughter. You'll like it if: 1. You want to see a film that was a musical --and they took out the music(no kidding); 2. You can weed through all the characters you hate until they mellow out; and 3. You want to see some great acting by Nick Nolte, the only one you really like. There is a scene when Nolte bursts forth with what acting is all about.You want to stand up and cheer."
3,"Fun, but nothing too new","This book had a lot of fun, and inexpensive things that you can do for your spouse. Most of the items were nothing too new however, and you have most likely already done them. Still, a cute book, and it would be good for newlyweds, since they wouldn't have had the time to try all the ideas before."
3,Some good ideas,"While the book had SOME good, original ideas for romancing your partner, it didn't have a LOT of them! Most of them were obvious old standbys.Good value for the price though.I would recommend it."
1,Broken when received and no replacement available,I was so disappointed when we received our sign and saw that the neon tube was broken right in the middle of the sign. I was even more disappointed when I learned that I would only be able to get a refund and no replacement. I received notification that there were no more in stock.
1,Broken on delivery (twice),"I ordered this product and it arrived broken from UPS. I sent it back, reordered another one, and it arrived broken. I asked for a refund which I received. Overall, a bad experience."
1,Too Fragile to Ship,"The sign was great looking in the advert. However, it was probably too fragile for shipping. We sent back the first two that were shipped due to broken glass.The shipper needs to do a better job of packing and marking the outside fragile might be a help."
1,Says 24 ea. Sent One,"Here is the description copied from their page: ""Chapstick Lip Balm Spf 4, Regular - 0.15 Oz, 24 Ea"". You will note the 24 ea. Well they send 1 ea. This waa a bargin for 24, I was presuming overstock, at one it is a rip off."
3,Large button cordless phone,This is the largest sized buttons on a cordless phone. I purchased for a family member who is legally blind. She still could not see the numbers. It is a normal cordless phone and has average sound quality.
3,Interesting Movie,"In case anyone didnt know, this is an animated film made in the late 80s. Daffy Duck inherets money from his rich uncle and starts a ghost hunting company with Bugs and Porky. Although Daffy is the star, all the classic WB characters apear in this film. This is a pretty good movie, as it combines a bunch of classic Warner Bros cartoons together into one story with new animation. The new footage is nicely animated, although the difference between it and the old cartoons are quite noticable. However, the writers do a good job of making tons of old cartoons flow together as one story.This is a good movie, but it is by no means ""one of the best animated movies of all time"" as other reviewers have said. Its a good movie of course and it entertains, but it is not a classic animated feature. Why, it has no comparision by the countless classic Disney features released decades before this. But if you take it for what it is, you will enjoy it."
2,Better off,It was a cute diversion but you are better off just watching the classic cartoons that were used to make up the story.
2,Don't like it,"Same as the lemon peel. It's very powdery. Not much of fragrant smell and taste. It looks old like sitting in a full sun and color faded away like years on the cabinet. I rather pay more to buy spices at Penzey Spices for the quality. You pay for the quality and expensive shipping. Takes too long for the delivery. I can always drive down to Penzey Spice store and get fresh, good quality spice. If too lazy, order online."
3,ahh?,The story is alright but not great it's mostly just about the two brothers always having sex. There is some plot but not much. The artworks good though. I'd say get this if you just kinda want to not think and read something with out a plot.
2,Dirty like garbage...,"Sex, Sex and More Sex: if your cravin a book of yaoi porn this is for you, pretty much from page one you'll get what you need. For those of us who like a story: read the summery, cuz thats the entire story-literally the rest of the text in this book is like accompanying sounds. The art is nice (except my nose bleed ruined the pages) the guys are hot, slim but with good muscle tone, if you like that.... I recommenced you borrow this from a friend and wrap some cellophane around it before you read."
4,Does Dawn's Dream Come True?,"Dawn can hardly believe she's now a student at one of New York City's best music schools, and it is a dream come true. Dawn still dreams about Jimmy, her boyfriend, and the love they share right along side the family secrets.Then Michael Sutton arrives. He is Dawn's new teacher, and also a singing star. He also happens to be the most handsome man Dawn has ever seen. He takes it pon himself to awaken feelings in Dawn that she has never known. Michael's promises of a love that will last forever and a chance at being a star soon prove to be empty when he disappears.Hurt, pregnant and very much along Dawn is now a slave to her granmother's whims, and is once again waiting for Jimmy to rescue her.This is a traditional VC Andrews book with all of the usual occurances, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth reading. There is just enough there to tease the reader into reading on, and for that reason alone I could have enjoyed the book."
3,Dawn is a brat.,"I had read this book quite some time ago, as well as the one after this. However, I needed to go back and read the first three over again before I go read the fourth. So I kind of knew what was going to happen. Dawn really got on my nerves in this book. I got so sick of her whiny attitude. It was either ""Oh Jimmy"" or ""Oh Micheal"". I got so sick of her saying it. Boo hoo Dawn. When she was at Miss Emily's she whined about not having any makeup or pretty clothes. When did she get so spoiled and selfish? I don't feel sorry for her at all. She got herself in tha mess because she's an idiot. She wanted nothing to do with Jimmy when she was seeing Michael. But when he's gone it's back to Jimmy again. She sounds like a user to me as well. But these kind of books and characters make VC Andrews as popular as she is."
3,Statutory Rape,"I enjoyed this story about Dawn's new experiences at the Bernhardt school and the students she befriended along the way. However, one thing bugs me to no end...How come Michael Sutton was never brought up on rape charges? Dawn was a minor when he seduced and impregnated her. How come the powerful, strong Lillian Cutler let him just walk away, scot free? I don't believe it. No responsibility, not even child support from a celebrity!! No way. And who doesn't get tired of Dawn singing, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", which is a classic, I agree, but doesn't she know anymmore songs than that?"
2,Good Novel,"i read this book before i read the book dawn, i was kind of confused until about the end when i learned the history of dawn. this is a good book, but all of VC Andrews books have basically the same theme."
3,"Boy, this book sounds familiar...","man, V C Andrews really must've had writers block whenever she wrote this book. does the Flowers in the Attic series ring a bell? they are almost identical, it's dumb! it's a pretty good book though, but it is very VERY similiar to the other series."
3,For beginners,If you have just a little experience with Pilates you could probably save your money on this one and go on to the intermediate bosu video.
3,Early Sam Elliot,This movie was before Sam really got his acting chops. It was okay but not the best of movies. He did not even have his famous deep voice going for him yet.
4,Great debut by young singer/trumpeter,"The CD debut by this 25 year old Swedish trumpeter and singer as a band leader is great. His sidemen do a fine job too - the same trio by the way that accompanied Lisa Ekdahl so well on her two jazz CDs.The quartet presents fine versions of a number of well-known jazz standards (Red sails in the sunset, Smile, Who can I turn to, How long has this been going on and a few more).Karl sings in a relaxed and intimate style. His trumpet playing is very fine indeed - his sound is exquisite and his playing is quite varied - ranging from the rather intense and daring to the quiet and lyrical. What is especially remarkable is the maturity of his playing. Just listen to his version of I remember Clifford!I love to listen this CD. And I recommend anyone who loves beautiful and expressive trumpet playing (coupled with fine relaxed singing) to get this CD."
5,My vet recommended this!,I have a foster dog who is very arthritic. I didn't like all the prescription medication he was on and my vet recommended that we use these supplements. I now have my dog off the steroids he was on. He loves to take his joint chews! He won't eat his food until he sees he isn't getting any more chews. We did need to go back to taking the vetprofen this winter since we can't get out and walk as much each day. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a dog that is getting older. Please start before your dog gets in the shape my poor foster dog is. I think he could have avoided his condition if he could have be on this a long time before now.
2,NOT compatible with all brands!,"The description says it's compatible with all laminator brands, but it's not! My brand requires a carrier, which this package does not have. Now I have to keep searching for ""just"" a carrier to laminate handouts for students, or buy another package that DOES come with a carrier. God grief!"
5,In Defense of Fellowes...,"Despite the item description above, the packaging for these laminates does not state that they will work with all brands of laminators. However, these 3-mil pouches do work quite well with almost all Fellowes laminators, from my lowlyML 95tothe top of their line.I would encourage anyone purchasing a new Fellowes laminator to buy this assortment at the same time. Even if you plan to only do ID cards or letter-sized jobs, it's handy to have a few odd sizes around."
5,A Disturbing Presence,"I loved this book! I don't usually choose mysteries but I couldn't put it down! The characters all ""came alive"" in the story...very impressive for her first book! Keep 'em coming, Ms. Rutter!"
3,Feels a lot like a laptop if that is what you are looking for...,"I wanted a very slim keyboard that felt like a laptop keyboard since that is what I am most used to.Unfortunately it comes with no software and I have not found any on their website so that you can see volume change status etc.The most irritating thing about the keyboard is the placement of an additional ""\"" key next to the space bar on the left hand side. I hit it all the time instead of ALT. If it were not for this stupidly placed key I would have given it 4 stars.Overall it is a decent keyboard."
3,Not for gamers,"If your a gamer, this keyboard won't last with you very long. Keys were coming off the keyboard after 1 month of use. (the C key then the X key). Other than that, the keyboard has a good feel to it. Great for typing, but you cant get rough with it I guess."
5,"Nice keyboard, but could've been just a bit better","I do not want to repeat everything that all the others wrote about this keyboard, except for a fact that it is nice, solid, fast, and inexpensive for its quality. What I do not like about it (although I could not give it less than 5 stars) is the regular-size NumLock key (some Logitech boards have a smaller NumLock key, which allows your to avoid pressing it accidentally). Well, it is just a wish, actially. Also, I am not crazy about the placement of the Delete key: it is somewhat hard to reach. The second ''|\'' key exists for no reason (I guess that the manufacturer did not want to make another irregular size ''Alt'' or ''Start'' key ) and it kind of interferes, sitting between the ''SpaceBar'' and the left ''Alt''. Yes, I type fast, I type ALOT. So, certain things do make difference for me. There are no perfect keyboards, but this one is certainly above-the-average in so many ways."
2,Great while it lasted,"This keyboard was great and one of the most comfortable I have ever used. However, after only two months some of the keys started 'sticking' and it became impossible to use."
3,Good but not Great,"I purchased this keyboard after doing quite a bit of looking around for a quiet touch keyboard. My coworker has an issue with ""noise"" and we sit pretty close together in an open area in the office. My typing of letters and emails bothered her because of the clacking my other keyboard made.This keyboard is a lot quieter but it's not silent. It was not touted as ""silent"" and the price was certainly very reasonable.The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 is because a couple of the keys don't always work when pressed the first time and seem to require a bit more pressure.All in all, a decent keyboard for the money."
4,Nice Slim Keyboard,"If you are looking for the feel of a laptop while typing at your desktop, then this keyboard will suffice. I've enjoyed using it for the past year or so.I prefer a lighter touch, but I think most people would find this keyboard a lot more enjoyable than the standard PC keyboards which basically require you to pound each freakin' character.I unfortunately blew mine to smithereens with static shock yesterday. Never had that happen before, but it is definitely toasted."
3,NOT for anyone with large hands,"I've used this for months. Great feel and in many ways I love it and very much appreciate the compact size...I have 4 computers and I'm drowning in keyboards. It's because it's so good in so many ways that I'm frustrated by a pair of fatal flaws. 1) The ""caps lock"" key does not have a right side depression like on every Microsoft, Logitech or full-size Apple keyboard I've ever owned. I have large male hands and I'm can rarely type more than a few lines without hitting the caps lock when going for the ""A"" key. 2) Same on the other side -- I find that I'm always snagging the ""home"" key when backspacing. The keys are fairly short-travel, so it only takes a very light touch to activate a switch. I can excuse the home key problem because of the compact design, but not the cap locks problem. This is not bad engineering, just dumb, thoughtless design, probably to save a tenth of a cent. If you have petite paws, I'd say go for it! But I'm planning to replace mine."
5,My best keyboard so far,"I have been using *quite a few* keyboards for the past 30+ years of my miserable geek existance, and I must confess this one really does the trick.It feels fast due to short key course and very natural. The keys surface is actually not slick but slightly textured which makes it quite confortable.Besides the Kensington Logo which seems glued on top the design is nice.Although I wouldn't recommend doing this, it does take the once-in-while keyboard bashing pretty well (well, if you don't care about the back tabs which came off naturally after the first instance of such bashing).Innovation doesn't come that often in keyboards and I see real value in this item."
4,Sleek N Sexy,"The feel of the keyboard closely resembles that of a Laptop layout. You will either love it or hate it. For me, I love it especially due to the F1-F12 keys being close to the number keys (I'm a gamer).One thing that boggles me is the fact that the mfgr added another Backslash ""\"" key between the Left Alt and Space Bar buttons. This will take some getting used to and is rather uncomfortable when holding the Alt button + another key for extended periods of time.Overall, it's the solid quality and smooth keystrokes that earned this baby 4 of 5."
1,Don't buy this keyboard,The sliver band outside the keyboard will wear out in less than 2 months for regular users.The keyboard will look very bad.Don't buy it. Kengington will not cover this in their warranty.
2,Loss of Valuable USB Ports Too Great,"I need my computer's ports for the USB devices I have that can't be powered through the keyboard. I can't afford to use them up with the keyboard and mouse. And, the loss of the two USB ports that are always on a Mac's keyboard is too great a loss. You can't even plug the mouse in, for heaven's sake! No, if Kensington is going to put ""for Macs"" on the package, they must design the keyboard to have built-in USB ports, or else it just doesn't work, not for me. I returned mine."
4,Sleek and sassy,"I bought the Slim Type because of inadequate space but I'm lovin the crisp, light touch. I've only had the keyboard about 5 days but I've already gotten use to the compact keys. I'd rate the product and the purchase transaction four stars."
5,Just like a laptop keyboard,"I love short-action keyboards, like my Sony Vaio's, and was looking for something similar to use in front of a large additional monitor on my desktop. Kensington's Slim keyboard is just what I was looking for: light touch, short-action keys, small and slim. I actually got to like it better than the Vaio keyboard - and that's saying a lot."
5,Very nice Keyboard,"I got this keyboard over the spring of 2006. It is a lot smaller, lighter, and easier to type on than a normal keyboard that comes standard with new IBM model computers. The keys are laptop style keys. I have not had a problem with this keyboard since I've received it back in May/June. I definitely recommend this product for those looking for a smaller keyboard."
1,Lasted about a month!,"After less than one month of light use about half the number keys and five other's just stopped working today. I am currently using the 10 dollar cheapo that I thought I had replaced with the Kensington. Phooey!It is a nice keyboard overall but maybe a little overpriced for the build quality. The keys are pretty darn quiet, but still not as nice as a Mac keyboard. The 'chrome' border around the entire thing is cheap looking and distracting as well.I do not like where the delete key is at all. Anyway, to their credit Amazon responded immediately to my email and is sending me a replacement. I will have to see how well it does and how long it lasts. If it also gives out, then I will try another brand.If I had it to do all over again I would most likely NOT buy this thing. Oh well, live and learn right?PRODUCT UPDATE as of 9-30-09 Replacement keyboard still working. Adjusted score: 4 stars, 1 off for delete key being in a WEIRD place!"
2,Expensive -- short life span!,"I bought this $30 keyboard because my keyboard tray is fairly narrow, and all the tricked-out keyboards available today are bigger than they need to be. It worked great for about 9 months, after which the left Ctrl key gave out. I'm not a key-pounder -- I'm glad I saved my old $10 generic keyboard, which is still going strong after years of use."
3,"Great design, misses keys","Love the smaller design of the thing. It takes up less space on the desk, and it's easy to reach the function keys. Delete, home, and end are in different spots, but that didn't bother me too much.Unfortunately, if you don't hit the exact center of the key, it will often not register. I never have much of an issue with typing, however I often miss keys in gaming. This isn't an issue I've had with any other keyboard.If you're planning to write essays on it, I'd recommend it. If you're buying it for gaming, I wouldn't."
1,huh?,"I did not try this diet because I couldn't get past the first few chapters, it's a pretty boring read. The informatation makes sense, but the diet does not. Soft Chew or Hard Chew foods, I don't get. There are too many rules. I will be interested to see other reviews."
4,Good product,Very easy to clean and secure. Works great for feeding box. Only problem is the lid is hard to get on and off. Reccomended
4,Very good book on a overlooked subject!,"With a lack or ""great"" titles on this subject, this book is my favorite if the 3 I have read. Middlebrook has a great style in writing and all of his works always hits the mark. While not wasting very much time with the events on the world stage, Middlebrook informs the reader on this important ""war"" fought at the height the Cold War. The reader is given many first person accounts (mostly British, with some Argentine, and Falklander comments) which greatly add to the enjoyment of this book. The reader can see how the UK, one of the worlds Former ""superpowers"" could very easily have lost this war and control over the Falklands. The Land, Sea, and Air stories are all told (the Air war was lacking of the 3), as well as some of the behind the scenes maneuverings in London, Buenos Aries, and Ascension Island. Logistically the British were very challenged, this point was not delved into enough for my liking. Over all, a great author comes through again."
4,Yum!,"This book is really nice...I like the cute size of it. The recipes in here, which I've tried are fairly simple, and the more complex ones ask for some more exotic ingredients which I don't really feel comfortable with. But otherwise, the book offers some good advice, and the simple recipes are all ones that anyone would be familiar with. May I especially recommend the Onion Soup...Yum! ^_^"
2,too simple for cordon bleu,"I have used none of the recipes. I have another cordon bleu book, ""the complete cook"" which I have used a lot. This soup book is oversimplified and uses the cordon bleu name for marketing, not quality."
3,vamos a bailla,"raza,locos if your throwing a backyard party and need something to kick-start the bailla this number is it!"
4,Good basic metal strainer,"I was looking for a cover for a bathroom drain to allow me to remove the normal bathroom sink stopper for baby-proofing purposes (if the sink can't be stopped up, I didn't have to worry about my child turning on the water and creating a potentially hazardous water level). This product works but doesn't fit perfectly.It's metal, so it won't mold to the sink curves. However, it does sit nicely in the bottom of the sink and doesn't move around - the holes are big enough to not create back pressure and slow draining.Not perfect, but better than anything else I could find and the price was right."
2,strainer,"I am very disappointed. said there were two strainers, only got one. also it is metal, wanted plastic. won't buy again."
4,It does the job,"This tub strainer stops debris from entering the pipes, but as it is not an attached fixture it does occasionally move from it's designated spot, most often when my cat jumps in the tub to play with it."
4,The stainless steel strainer by same company is a better deal,"This is a really good kitchen drain strainer, but with a major drawback. It fits the drain perfectly, is easy to clean, etc., but the paint finish will only last a few months before it begins to chip, crack and then rust....staining the sink. The PERFECT kitchen drain strainer is the same as this one, but made out of stainless steel. It's also made by ""Progressive"" and is model number: GT-6746. It is only a little bit more $, but well worth it. Search it out here on Amazon. I've had the stainless steel one for over 3 years and it is as good as new. It will last forever."
3,Perfect except for one thing,"This is so good for the kitchen sink, but the paint chips off. If I could get this in stainless steel or something that doesn't chip I would be very happy."
5,Great quality,"We use this to catch hair in the bath tub. I like that it is metal and not cheap plastic. It can easily be wiped clean, and it does a great job catching hair!"
1,OSAT study guide,They don't really have this product in stock and it took them a month to figure that out
2,I would not buy this again,Pros:It looks good.Safe car-seat.Baby Trend Customer Service was pretty good.Cons:After a few months of use the wheels squeak.The stroller and the car seat are heavy.Does not fold to a compact size.Hard to adjust stroller seat position.+ quite a few more consAll in all we regret this purchase.
3,"great carseat, dangerous stroller","We received this travel system as a gift and we love the carseat. It's very easy to use and our daughter seems to like it. However, I was taking her on a walk with the carseat attached to the stroller and the stroller collapsed. Luckily, she was strapped into the carseat, so she was not hurt, just scared pretty badly. The locks on the stroller are defective. They look like they are engaged, but you can stick a piece of paper between the locks and the holes that they are supposed to fit into. I called Baby Trend and their warranty is only for 180 days and I have to pay for shipping the stroller back and for insurance. I have not resolved this matter with them yet and hope they will stand behind their product."
3,"Safe, but not easy","The stroller is a smooth ride and has held up well to the rough terrain I tend to puch it over. The color is nice, and my son seems to like it well enough. But the baby carrier is SO heavy, the buckle system is very cumbersome, the handle part of the carrier is very difficult to adjust, and even though my son's feet are starting to hang out, he still doesnt seem to get proper support in the upper half of the seat. the base is fine, except that I cant get it level enough to no have my son's head completely fallen forward when he sleeps. Any type of bucket seat makes the base adjustment difficult. So it has worked well enough, but I plan to get a different one for my next child."
4,Great system,"I love this system. I only have 2 complaints. 1) It's a bit big and doesn't fit in the trunk of my car very well. I can fit it in there with maybe a shopping bag or two, but not much. Of course, I have a small car (Subaru Impreza). 2) When you fold the stroller down the front tray easily smacks down on the ground and has scratched the front of the tray. You have to fold it carefully in order to avoid scratching it up.The things I love about it are the fact that it's sturdy, easy to maneuver, and despite it being big, it'll still go through most aisles. My son seems comfortable and secure in the stroller.The carseat is heavy. Heavier than other carseats, but it's rated one of the safest carseats (at least it was when I bought it). The material doesn't breathe well, so in the heat, baby got a little sweaty. That wasn't a big deal to me. My son never seemed to get over-heated or uncomfortable in the carseat.Over all, I'd recommend this system to others."
3,A Great Remastering,"Wow. This album isn't as good as Philip Oakey's work as front man for The Human League, but this release blows the original's release away. The cover art is totally redone (beautiful). The songs are louder & clearer with some really great remixes added. The only real dud song on this one is ""Be My Lover Now"", which was a single, but always seemed VERY cheesy to me (even for The Human League)."
5,pleasure plus!,"Just a real pleasure to hear this album again. What joy this music evokes! This was a short album, barely 30 minutes in the original vinyl form, but this CD reissue contains a generous batch of remixes and instrumental versions of the songs, pushing it over the hour mark. But minutes are meaningless in this case; it's the power of these danceable tunes that will win you over. The first three tracks (including the amazing ""Good-bye Bad Times"") plus ""Together in Electric Dreams"" are all stone-cold classics, and the rest of the tracks are solid to wonderful compositions. There is an addictive pulse and rhythm to this music that's rarely been equaled in album form. Oakey's vocals and Moroder's deft production touch makes for melodic electro magic!"
2,Disappointing,"I ran it on a Windows ME machine and every time you open Talk It Type It, it places a toolbar at the top of the desktop. That's not a bad thing - until you close the software. It leaves a blank space where the toolbar was, and reopening the program places the toolbar *below* that space. (Refreshing the desktop does not fix this.)Despite repeated training sessions, I had major problems when it came to the software distinguishing commands from words. Half the time, it typed instead of responding to commands like ""capitalize,"" ""new paragraph,"" ""scratch that,"" ""delete that,"" and ""delete [word]."" (As you might guess, I had to use those last 3 a lot.)I suppose it's fine for instant messaging, but I wouldn't use it beyond that."
1,"talk it, don't type it!!","This was the most disappointing and useless purchase ever. Despite exhausting voice training, it typed everything except what I said. Don't waste your money. I would'nt even give it one star."
1,Most annoying,"This is one of those pieces of software that never really works, but you can't really get rid of. I've used it once when I could modify my voice to make it do as I asked (it would have been 10 times easier just to type it out). It appears every time I boot up (sorry, I am sure I should have de-clicked something upon install...) and it takes forEVer to initialize, slowing down everything ,even though I don't even want it. I uninistalled it to get rid of it, and the interface still appears on Bootup. It's like poison ivy that just won't go away. We don't need any more software that a)takes over and b) won't leave when asked."
4,nice little program,"The program worked fairly well but it takes TIME for it to recognize your voice and type the right words. It is not something that you just install on your pc and go. For the price, it is worth the time and effort. Just don't expect perfection."
1,I never recied my product or refund!,Not only did I never recieve my product but I never recieved a refund for my purchase either. Where is my product? Where is my money? I am still waiting to hear back from this seller.
3,werd,That guy is crazy. Eclipse rips the wheels. Sometimes the turntablism does get overdone. This is when independent music was just starting to blossom. Lots of raw rare underground goodies. Cop it!
5,Perfect introduction,As a complete beginner the thought of learning a new programming language was daunting. I looked at a lot of other books and none of them seemed to cater to the 'complete novice'. Then I happened to pick up this book. What I found was a clear and concise introduction to the language. The lessons are short and to the pint and the scripts give a good practical way of learning. Since reading this I have been able to begin writing my own scripts and intergrating them into php.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to learn SQL. An excellent introduction to the basics and fundamentals of the language.
2,not quite what I expected,As satisfied I am with the service the product it just doesn't fulfill my expectations. It doesn't distort the image it just puts a black circle around it..
3,A good start,"This was obviously written by someone who has read Lee Smith's work closely and cares deeply about it. But unlike so many of the other excellent books in the Twayne series, this one seemed to have an agenda all its own. While the ideas discussed were very interesting (a sort of new age, feminist perspective) I didn't feel it was quite right for something like Twayne, which has always been more of an overarching perspective of an individual writer's work.I felt that I was reading someone's thesis -- a well written one, but something that was about the micro, not macro themes and ideas behind Smith's work."
1,Horrible sound quality/worse appearance -$200 mistake!,"The huge white wires and bulky volume/mute control are embarassing to wear in public. But I would if the sound was there...its not!I have to assume that the set I was sent is faulty. The sound is completly lacking any bass. I tried every set of plugs that were sent with the unit hoping to improve the sound, but no luck.Further, I receive complaints from people I talk to on the treo about my voice being sounding horrible/echo/tin like/hard understancd ect.I hope I can find the box to return this."
1,"If you want to throw away $6, be my guest","This didn't work, they'll place it digitally in my ""media library"" my ass. I just wasted $6, awesome. Don't purchase this because you won't be getting anything to show for it. No stars."
3,Blues Clues costume,The only thing we didn't like is Blues head doesn't stand up like it does on the picture. My mom and to sew a hard plastic shield that was the same shape and size on the back of the head so it would stand up and you could actually tell what my sone was. Before she did that all you could see whas his mouth and ears. Other than that the costume fits well and he is excited about getting to be Blue.
5,"He likes his new camera, but is totally in love with this tripod!","This is a unique design, but it works very well and is a high quality. It can be used raised a little and put on a table, it can be very tall, or it can be used with only one leg to steady your hand. My other half just likes playing with it! He loves it. The camera is nice, but the tripod is terrific!"
3,Pleasant and Calm Sort of Story,"I know I promised to stop reading these books but I have a whole pile of them and this one was on top.It's not too bad. Josephine Dowling is the eldest of the local doctor's three children. She is working as a ward sister at a London hospital. One day She is walking her dog on a visit to her home when she (and the dog) are nearly run down by a Bentley. (Neels has a thing about cars, she makes as much of the cars as she does the houses, the clothes and the food.) Inside the car is Julius van Tacx, a large Dutch doctor.Inevitably they clash and inevitably they find themselves working together.However the misunderstanding is kept to a minimum and only occurs toward the end, mainly this is the story of two people falling in love with no big dramatics or fireworks. The most outstanding thing about the heroine is that she is a size fourteen. However, she doesn't obscess on her size.Looking for a pleasant and undemanding romance? It's here."
5,Food for thought,"Mitchell Froom is of course known for his production work (Bangles, Crowded House, Los Lobos, Latin Playboys, Suzanne Vega). He is less known for his own musical expertise, the recordings of which actually give you an idea why musicians hire him. This time around he takes an unusual approach, recording an album that is piano only (with a few synth layers here and there). Quiet, relective, with melodies and motifs that make you think you've known them for years... yet sound fresh and different at the same time. This is the perfect record to put on as a final chill-out after a long night of partying... or in fact the first thing you put on the morning after while you prepare breakfast. In the most positive of meanings, this is music to think to, read to, talk to or just relax to. Never sappy, never clichéd. Well done, Mr. Froom, now that is no small achievement."
3,"OK, but something missing...","I'm a fan of the Introducing series. I don't want to be too critical of this book, but I was a bit disappointed. I did learn a little more than I knew before I read it, but as many of the reviews say, the organization is a bit ""chaotic"" to the point where you feel you're never given a true overview of the subject. An introduction to any topic should at least try to leave you with some framework of organization for the topic as a whole.You can probably learn as much about Chaos theory by reading the Wikipedia article. If I'm going to buy a book, I want something more. Perhaps a deeper exploration into one practical application of Chaos theory that shows it as a real science with a purpose. One is almost left with the impression that Chaos theory is more a post-modern criticism of western science rather than a true alternative explanation of phenomenon."
1,"Save your money, too many pictures, too few words",I was disappointed in this book. Every page almost has a picture. The pictures don't teach anything of substance. If you take out all the pictures you probably have 20 pages or less of text.
3,"Not 16 Pack, but only a 4 Pack","The quality and taste of this product is good, but the problem is ""it's not a 16 pack"". I ordered this thinking I was going to get 12 pounds of candy judging by the shipping charge, but when it came in the mail is was only 4 packs with 24 candies in each pack with a retail price of $.25 each per rope. If you look at most of the other Laffy Taffy Rope candy sold directly by Amazon it comes as a ""4 Pack"" for a few cents cheaper and the real mailing weight of only two pounds. I complained and Amazon gave me free reshipment of this product, and guess what they sent me another ""4 Packs""! Amazon needs to change this product description, because you're not getting 12 pounds of candy (more like two pounds), and you definitely will not get ""16 Packs"" of candy. The actual candy is pretty good though, and actually taste like a combo of mango and melon chewy, semi-soft taffy."
3,Same comment as other reviewer - not 16 but only 4,"I agree with the other reviewer. They ship 4 packs not 16. I ordered this product in Oct. 2007 and again last week. They shipped 4 packs. I contacted Amazon and they sent a ""replacement"" order. I explained to the CSR that it should be 16 and I need 12 more. He assured me I will get another 16 packs, but when the order arrived it was again 4 packs. I contacted Amazon again and they gave me a refund.I figured they would change the item description, but apparently they still haven't."
4,"Great disc, but don't recommend for children under 5","My 5 year old son loves this CD, but it scares my two year old a little."
5,Captures the Magic of The Books and Then Some!!,"Based on the wonderful series by Mary Pope-Osborne, this CD captures the magic of the books and then some! The songs are sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy (believe me, you'll be listening to them again and again and again - my son has then entire CD memorized!) and the music is captivating. Definitely not your typical ""kid's show"". I went to mthmusical.com to learn more about this show because I heard that it was going on tour and my son is so excited to see it ... it doesn't have cities and dates yet, but I definitely plan on checking back because this is not a show I want to miss. My son loves ""the guard song"" and I love a really sweet duet between Jack and Annie called, ""What Would I Do Without You"". It's worth the price of the CD alone! Happy Listening!"
5,My boys LOVE it!,"My boys, ages 6 and 7 share a bedroom. At night they like to listen to Audio books. Recently they started listening to the AudioBooks given out by Wendy's as part of their kids meals. Several of the books were Magic Tree House stories. They love the stories, but it was the song at the end of each that really intrigued them. I finally ordered them the entire musical and they LOVE it. They have even ""choreographed"" several of the numbers! Nothing like walking in on two little boys, supposedly drifting off to sleep, in a full out do-si-do to the musical! Since they loved this one so much I recently added, The Lion King, Shrek, Annie, and Mary Poppins musicals as well."
1,Self-indulgent,"Story line, props, script and acting reminds me of a 50's sci-fi movie. There's suppose to be a message embedded in the story but unfortunately it drowned in the self-indulgence of this really poor quality film."
3,Long Dream- Japanese Movie,"Long Dream is a little confusing but pretty cool, it has some really creepy images of what looks like an alien.Long Dream is a movie about a guy who has dreams that last many months and sometimes years in length, his body weakens and changes as his mind thinks all that time really passed. When the guy eventually decintrigrates little red crystals are found in his head, the doctor (having never dreamed and wanting to) thought the crystals were what was causing the guy to dream so he put them in himself and that's where it gets confusing...I think what happened is the doctor is actually the patent having the dreams and what was always shown as the patient was actually the doctor...idk go rent it watch it and draw your own conclusions.I give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars"
3,It was something to watch,"The lead actress was good. That is about all I can say. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great. Purely a time=killer."
5,I am a Sci Fi fan,"You really have to be into Sci Fi to enjoy this but since I watch the Sci Fi channel and these movies are not that expensive, It was worth the couple of bucks."
4,The Doomsdah Prophecy,"Schmaltzy, but I liked this movie. It was an interesting story and the acting/scripts were both good. Not great, just good."
3,Entertaining,"This movie is fun to watch, but I would put it in the ""B"" list of movies. It is entertaining and the price was perfect."
1,Bad bad bad,"Don't waste your time or your money on this movie! Those who rated this movie above 1 star must be apart of the movie itself or have never seen another movie in their life! I dare say a group of grade school kids could have made and acted out a better movie! I have never written a review for anything until now, I bought this movie based on the reviews of others. Seeing a 5 and 4 star review is shocking so I am warning future buyers... DON'T DO IT!! The acting is bad, the effects are bad, the whole thing is bad bad bad!Oh and by the way, this is a horrible movie!!! If I could have rated it lower I would have."
4,Fun take on apocalyptic adventure,"I really enjoyed this movie. The stars, while known, aren't top box office rated but the acting really was excellent. If you aren't into doomsday movies, this one isn't going to pull you into it. For those of us who love this sort of thing, it was a fun new take on it. Loved the way they used the Easter Island Heads in the story. I've always been fascinated by the scientific speculation and folk philosophy surrounding those monoliths. Honestly, if you are a sci-fi fan, you'll probably figure its worth a couple bucks to watch this flick."
1,"blah, blah, blah","Spoiler alert - if you saw ""Full Impact"" you know how this one ends, unfortunately the acting and special affects are not as good. Not even close."
5,"EL GT, London","This is nicely done, well-polished, solid bracelet with strong hidden clasp. I need to make just one correction - on the photo it is round shape, but actually it's Rounded Square . I like it anyway."
5,"great product, sizing off","As with all Imse Vimse products, the sizing is off, so don't expect this to fit a newborn. Try premie size if you want it for a newborn. Truly great products though: longevity, softness. The wool is very soft. The velcro is aplix, so it's the nice kind that doesn't collect pills/lint and doesn't degrade with washing. And, the same benefit of all wool diapering products: no odor retention. These won't need washed much, so you don't need to buy as many either, but don't forget to relanolize to maintain waterproofness."
5,Good aerobic workout!,I bought this video in '97 and still enjoy working out with it today. I cross-train and have a wide variety of programs that I do but this one still remains a favorite. It really works you AND it's very easy to follow. You will have a great time working out to this one.
5,Practical and Powerful Pointers for Parents,"The featured experts are passionate about the topic. They are engaging speakers offering valuable and loving guidance for parents in a world that grows ever more complicated each day. My kids are teens, and I discovered that even the advice targeting parents of very young children could be modified and applied with my big kids! I especially connected with Kelly Bryson, who wove into his presentation so many beautiful and compelling stories from his own parenting experiences."
5,Our bedtime book,"We got this at a neighborhood kid-stuff swap and it's a total gem! I love the illustrations--warm and vivid, they tell much of the endearing, gentle going-to-bed story. I also like that the words are rhythmic and rhyming; it's perfect for bedtime. In fact, we didn't mean for it to, but this book has become our bedtime cue. It's the last thing we do before turning out the lights and my daughter immediately knows what's coming when we say ""time for Ten Nine Eight!"" She sits through the whole thing and loves the first picture of the toes and the last picture of the little girl with her teddy bear."
5,Goodnight My Love,"...Ten, Nine, Eight is perfect in all aspects: the African American characters can help my children relate to the book because the characters look like them; the father who puts his daughter to bed speak volumes for those who want to see an Afican American MALE in a positive role; and the short, simple story encourage children to read even if it is only from memory.In my family, my son is the third child to enjoy this book. This book is one to be treasured and passed down."
5,simply beautiful,"WOW!!!!! what imagery, heart and beauty..Tess Gallagher's tributebook to her deceased husband Raymond Carver,is the words of a grieving angel..""Deaf Poem"" is my favorite.moon over bridge willgo down in history as one of the great book of poems dealing withlove,lost and renewal again..and i couldnt help thinking after reading it,how truly blessed Mr Carver was to have a love likeTess in his life..and every man would be blessed to have a ladylove them just a tenth as much as she did..and does..pick upthis book!!!!!you wont regret it.."
3,Works good for your old dog,This stuff works . But my Vet said you can give your dog people glucosamine. So think before you buy
2,A Big Disappointment,This book is just too elementary. I was very disappointed when I got it. It must have been designed for high school students.
2,"Good price , bad iteam!","i got yhis book , i mean it works for what i want it but the sheets are like almot to that little point that will get out of the book if i try even to move it :*("
2,Lots of fluff.,"This book was 90 pages long. It would have been a much better read if it was 30. Its focus is on the interaction of Argentina and the IMF. If you want to know what happened to the man on the street, this is the wrong book for you. If you want to know what an ex IMF official thinks how the IMF should behave to fiscally irresponsible countries, this is the book for you."
2,Beautiful but very small,"Beautiful designs as pictured, but too small for using for dinner plates. Wish we could have known the scale before purchase"
5,japanese stoneware sepia mixed design,"We love these dishes but are having a terrible time finding large square dinnerplates to complete our set!Japanese Stoneware Plate Set Includes 4 Plates Each with a Different Design, Sepia"
2,Difficult to Follow,"Simply put, this book is difficult to follow. It has a scattered framework, and it's examples are a bit too long."
4,This one should not be missed.,"The track ""Never Get Your Love Behind Me"" is a serious stepper, and alone is worth the price of admission. Why these guys weren't much bigger is beyond me. Their lead singer has as much depth (if not, maybe more) as contemporaries Daryl Hall and Michael McDonald. I still include it in my sets here in Chicago, as do many other DJ's. Don't sleep on this, if you can find it, GET IT!"
5,I owe much to this book.,"The key to reading the Greek New Testament is to know the 500 most used words so well that you couldn't forget them even if you tried. Every other NT Greek book does not provide enough reading exercises!!!This book does. It will get you to that point where you have the basic vocab burned into your neurons.It is not the only book you will need, but you do need it.--someone who reads the Greek NT daily"
2,different than picture,"Though this is a nice color, it really wasn't what I expected. The color is a lot brighter and has a sort of shimmer. It's still a fun shade but I probably wouldn't have bought it if I had known what it really looked like."
3,In Another Country,In Another Country..was a boring story..I mean..it has some detail.But Hemingway uses an odd style...
3,Do NOT use with old plumbing lines,"Handy little things in general, however, after a $300 plumbing bill these will never be used in my house again. I have one of those adorable little Craftman bungalows...with adorable 70+ year old cast iron pipes. Only use these if you have PVC plumbing or they will clog up like you have never seen before. According to my plumber these wipes break down some time AFTER they leave your plumbing neighborhood."
3,"Great, but I have to agree DO NOT FLUSH!!!!","I have to admit, I loved these wipes especially for my kids....UNTIL I needed to call a 24 hour plumber for emergency sewer surgery!! After finding a lovely waterfall into my basement with every flush, the plumber arrived to tell us that the flushable wipes had created a clog in the piping. We too have older piping that is not the new PVC stuff, so I DEFINITELY AGREE, DO NOT FLUSH THESE UNLESS YOU HAVE NEW PVC PIPING AS YOUR SEWER LINES!! Not just in the basement, because that is what we have. Just sharing my $200 (2 cents)."
1,Severe allergic reaction,Cottonelle contains a preservative that causes contact dermatitis in those who are allergic. It is extremely uncomfortable and takes a couple of weeks to clear up after you stop using the product. If you have hypersensitivity to chemicals and need something hypoallergenic avoid this like the plague.
2,not well good product,This product is way to harsh for what you would expect to use it for. It can clean the stains off you driveway but i wouldn't use it on any sensitive skin (again). Does not work as well as my regular brand
1,Don't expect them to pop up!,"If you want to put a flushable wipe in a pop-up container - find something else. You'll be digging into the tub trying to re-start the pop-up flow EVERY TIME. This creates a lot of waste. They tear easily, which I expect in a ""flushable wipe. I don't have a septic system so that doesn't matter to me. The reason I gave this product one star is that the product description says you can buy these wipes in the pop-up tub or this refill pack so I assumed they were pop-up refills and they are NOT. Very frustrating and not really a returnable product."
1,CAUSES SEVERE RASHES,DO NOT use these wipes. These caused my son a terrible rash with open sores that became infected. These wipes contain a highly-allergenic preservative called MCl which should never be left on the skin!
1,Do not use!,"After using this product for over a period of time I developed serious burning,itching and pain. After reading another review on this site I realized it was caused by these wipes. I also so glad I found the review. Anyone using it should stop. It may take some time to develop this problem so,if you just started , stop!"
5,The BEST!,My husband did some research and decided on this air purifier. It was the best purchase made this year! We put this in our bedroom and no longer wake up in the morning with a stuffy nose. We're going to purchase another one for the living room. I highly recommend the Rabbit Air BioGS. It is extremely quiet and works GREAT!
5,"Great product, with the one drawback","Same thing everyone else said, very quiet, works great on killing odor, built pretty solid, easy to use... the one drawback is the very bright screen at night. My solution was to just put a piece of foil draped over the top to cover it, works like a charm and simple to remove (don't need to tape it if you just mold it over the top middle). Worth every penny though."
2,"Not ""Ultra Quiet""","I have owned a Rabbit Air SPA-582A for three years and have been pleased with its performance. Decided to get an SPA-421A to place at the other end of the larger house I bought to balance things out. I was disappointed upon starting it to hear that its not as whisper quiet as its big brother. The fan motor makes an noticeable oscillating humming noise even on ""auto"" with the fan running at its lowest speed. When the SPA-582A is on auto it can't be heard at all unless it catches a whiff of dust or odor. Add to that the charcoal filter is thinner and cheaper and I'm really wishing I'd spend the extra $70 for another SPA-582A. Its better (well, at least they were three years ago - hopefully the whole line up hasn't been cheapened)."
5,Love It!!!,"I love my Rabbit Air purifier. It arrived quickly, works wonderfully and was easy to set up. ..just unpack, pop in the filters, plug it in and turn it on. It is also extremely lightweight and can be moved from room to room, even by a child. My home now smells fresh and clean. Whenever I spray any type of chemicals in my home, such as bug spray or lysol ... or when I sweep or dust, the Rabbit Air kicks into high gear ridding my home of chemicals, smells and dust! That is something I need because my son has asthma and allergies. I'm thinking of buying two more. A second one for my house and one for my father's business. His patrons smoke and this would remove smoke from the air.The price seems high, but I believe it's worth every penny. You will never regret purchasing it."
4,Pricey but you get what you pay for.,"The Rabbit Air is by far the best air filter I ever owned. It is quiet and does a reasonably good job filtering air. Smell and dust sensor is a nice touch, but I don't expect the sensors to work well forever. I care about quiet operation and filter quality but not so much about gimmicks such as smell and dust sensors. I'd like to see a cheaper version without the sensors. It is quiet enough to leave on 24/7 in my bedroom. It also function of air circulation fan."
4,Air Cleaner Positioning.,"Its important to consider placement of an air cleaner unit in relation to the architecture of the house. Generally speaking it is better to purchase an air cleaner that is rated for a much larger space than it will be used in, additionally, the paper listed below, is a study that models the fluid dynamics of an interior space for a particular home and indicates that the placement of the portable air cleaner can affect its performance anywhere from 2x upward.[...]Generally speaking, it is better to place an air cleaner in the center of the home, or in a smaller space such as an individual room, towards the center instead of off into a corner."
1,"Lousy, and OVER PRICED","My wife and I purchased this usit at I am an avid cigar smoker and we have kids. I read all the great reviews on this usit and thought for sure this was going to be a winner.I couldn't be more wrong.This unit itself is large and bulky. The filters and a pain to remove and clean, and the unit is NOT quiet as stated by the manufacturer. Not to mention the timer went out and now we're hearing crackling coming from inside the unit. Customer service was unhelpful and now this 500 dollar machine is sitting in the closet taking up space.We'll be switching back to Oreck soon. Stay away from this! Unless of course you like wasting money."
5,Best air cleaner!,"The Rabbit Air BioGS is a great air purifier. As I write this, it is sitting 5 feet away from my desk and set in the ""auto"" mode. I can't hear it unless it changes itself to the turbo mode, which it does if I open a dusty file or if the window is opened. The set-up was easy and the upkeep is inexpensive given that the filter is washable. At first I thought the item was too expensive, but now that I've gone a month without an asthma attack, I can tell that the Rabbit will pay for itself by saving me from medical expenses and lost work time. I can't wait to buy another for the bedroom and one for the kitchen/living room."
5,AWESOME!!!,"I just bought this product 2 days ago and I said I would write a review once I have tried it out for a week. It's been 2 days and I could not wait to write about this product. I suffer from severe allergies and they just seem to get worse every year. Once I got this air cleaner, my allergies magically diappeared.I also own a Sharper Image Ionic Breeze Quadra GP and this Bio fresh Ultra destroys the Sharper Image. The Sharper Image Ionic breeze will go into storage. Since owning this for 2 days my house is allergy free this air cleaner is by far the best air cleaner out for the price. Very easy to use and looks great. The air quality monitor is unbelievable!!"
5,Saved my marriage!,"Between my wife's cat, that sheds more than science can explain and an apartment so full of her exotic plants it looks like a National Geographic Special, I was ready to move to the car. I ate allergy pills like popcorn and the spring only makes it all worse. I've had my Rabbit for one month and I haven't taken one allergy pill since I plugged it in. I was sold by the reviewer that said it was recommended by his allergist. I doubted it was as quite as billed but it really is. Even on high, its a gentle purr. (The cat sleeps in front of it and probably thinks it is purring.) Its too early to comment on filter cleaning,and durability but my early impressions all very positive."
5,Excellent product,"It works perfectly. Very effective on dust and odor and can't imagine not having it. In addition, the customer service is really good. I had a faulty hepa filter and they have sent me a new one right away, no questions asked. Definitely recommended."
4,Rabbit air,Does what it claims. My apt was very dusty and you could see dust in the air when sunlight is bright through the windows and after a week or 2.. I'd say dust has been cut back by about 80-90%
3,time will tell,"The reviews read well, and the unit seems to detect and respond to different air quality levels. The fan had to be replaced after < a month operation. The original filter was disappointing when faced with outgassing from new cabinets so the company sent a new filter. So, with essentially a new unit, Time will tell whether it is a good purchase or not."
5,"Definitely works,","My son has allergies, and after reading the reviews, decided to try this purifier. We had a Honeywell purifier, but it was loud and didn't seem to do the job.After a month, I can see a difference with his allergies. The deciding factor was yesterday when we had our driveway sealed. The smell of the sealant seeped into the bedrooms. In our son's room, we turned the Rabbit Air on full fan. The other room, we used the Honeywell. After several hours, the smell of the sealant was gone in the boys room. The smell Was still superbad in the other room.Love this purifier. I will probably get another one!"
4,"supurb filteration, but not perfect","Pros:very quietfilters very wellautomatically adjusts when it senses odors or particulatesdoesn't look uglyCons:led display is VERY bright (i taped some cardstock over it)it complains to change the filter way more often than the specs statewhenever i reset the filter reminder, with it on auto, it would constantly think there was an odor and never go below the medium setting"
1,This product is a piece of junk,Air filter shuts off at will. Makes whining noise. Does not clean air well. Customer service is terrible. Do not buy this product.
1,performance one year later,"We bought the Rabbit Air BioGS and the other model(cannot remember) about a year ago. The BioGS has been a problem; strange odor coming from it; already replaced filters; still having problems. I would NOT buy these products again. I was surprised at the review which showed lower effectiveness than other types of air purifiers. Whatever the effectiveness, this product has been really problematic. The customer support team is great BUT for a great product, you should not have to worry about customer support.Rabbit Air BioGS (model 582A - covers 780 sq. ft.) Ultra-Quiet Air Purifier w/ Germicidal Sterilization- Low Maintenance - Washable Filters!, Chrome Silver"
2,Maybe we have good air to begin with...,I've been very disappointed with this machine and could have returned it if I had saved the original packaging. It doesn't seem to do anything. I thought the would be noticeably fresher but it isn't. It's a pretty color. We have allergies in our home and this hasn't made a bit of difference.
5,"Perfect, Sensors really work!","Man, this product its awesome, I just hit my bed many times to make dust, and the machine triggers to turbo mode by itself. That just made me write this review. The odor sensor also work, when the maid cleans in the morning, she use some stuff to clean, and the purifier instantly detects it.Im very happy with this product, no more allergies!"
4,Great for my situation,"I purchased one of these to go in a 900+ sq ft. apartment comprised mostly of an open kitchen-dining-living room. I don't have dogs or cats, but I do keep various kinds of reptiles, and cook a lot, so the filter was purchased primarily to cut down on odors.As best I can tell it's done this very well; between the filter and an occasional open window when the weather allows, the apartment is much fresher. It's my hope that this spring it does a number on the pollen in the air as well, so I can keep those windows open more, but I haven't had a chance to test that so far.I found the unit relatively easy to assemble and operate. Mine had a slight vibration caused by an imbalanced fan that was apparent at the highest setting, but since I tend to keep it turned down for the sake of quietness that hasn't been a problem."
4,Very Quiet,"The unit looks very stylish and it is very quiet. It has really reduced the amount of dust in the room.It seems to work very well. I wish there was a ""filter pack"" instead of so many individual filters that you have to unwrap, put in order, and install. It's not a big deal, but I did think it was a little inconvenient. I still think it's a great unit, and I am thinking about buying another one."
5,Kreg Miter Gauge System,"High quality, accurate and easy to use. I don't think you'll find a better Miter Guage for 120-130 dollars."
2,not as good as i would have expected from kreg,"This product is somewhat of a disappointment. I would have expected a vaery high quality product from kreg. I have had a Dubby sled miter for probably 15 years and have just purchased another and frankly i would recommend that you NOT purchase the kreg miter and seriously consider a dubby by inline industries. It is stable, rock solid and probably the easiest miter out there. The kreg just didn't cut it."
4,Good tool,"This is an excellent tool. My main happiness is that it is easy to set it up to be used in the right hand slot on the table. It is dead accurate -- I didn't have to tweak anything to make absolutely square cuts.HOWEVER -- I'd be a lot happier if the main slide bar was steel instead of aluminum. The aluminum bar flexes a lot. The plastic adjusters have to be adjusted EXACTLY right or the bar will flex, changing the cutoff angle - slightly. I'm a shipwright and a sometimes cabinet maker, running my own shop. If the slide bar were changed to steel, the tool would be perfect. (Yes, I'd be overjoyed to pay another $10 for a steel bar.)"
4,A Memorable Read,"Grief can be such an isolating experience. Many people are extremely uncomfortable with another person's pain. All too often, when that grief is from the loss of an animal, it can be regarded with even less tolerance from others. The comfort I found from reading this book was crucial to my healing process.When my beloved dog, an 11-year cancer survivor on all natural remedies, died in my arms at the age of 19, few pet-loss books spoke to the depth of my pain. This book was one of the few that did. I found its descriptive collection of stories, situations, and ritual, that other pet parents went through, incredibly validating."
2,I started it...and quicky stopped reading it.,"Not the book I wanted to address my loss at the time. I might try reading it again..but, I felt worse after I started reading it. This might be better to read prior to loss of pet."
4,excellent book for animal lovers,"This collection of stories, interviews, and poems is reassuring and inspiring. Anyone who has ever lost a pet they loved should find something to relate to in this book. The interviews with veterinarians are great and the first-person accounts of people dealing with their grief will make those suffering from a similar loss feel less alone and hopeless. Highly recommended!"
1,"When you sleep with the Boss, you can screw his creation too","Only two books out of the thousands I have read in my life so disgusted me with the blatant stupidity of the main character, that I have literally thrown the book. This was one.Spoiler Alert!-----After rampaging through a long corridor full of Shadows and minions, Galen is stymied by the bad guy's toadie holding a weapon to the head of his Mentor?Why open the door? Remove it. Why talk to the toadie? Remove all but his weapon hand from this universe. Why talk to the bad guys? Remove them. Why step into the room? Remove all of it but the spot his mentor occupies, then fly away with his mentor's remains. His actions after clearing the hallway are stupid stupid stupid ....I was so mad I threw the book, it shattered into its seperate pages, then I burned it."
2,eeehhhhhhhh,"While the way the technomages are shown combining guile with technology to was very interesting and almost made the books worth reading, the characters where every terrible marry sue cliche rolled together."
5,Electrifying,"This book was awesome, better than the 1st, but i have always found that. It was a non stop read, i read it in just 5 days, now i have to wait till november for the next book. Truly amazing, it makes you look at the technomages in a new light when you watch the series, and it explains some of the parts in the series that kind of went unmentioned. A must read for a b5 fan, but make sure you've read the 1st book 1st, it helps you understand the technomages better, and how they work."
