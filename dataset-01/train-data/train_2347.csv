4,Very enjoyable,"OK, lets cut to the chase. There is no one correct type of belly dance. I enjoyed this video. She is an in your face dancer that grabs you and does not let go. If you think her costumes are skimpy, check out some Turkish dance costumes sometimes. If you want to sit and pick a performance apart you can find things wrong with any dancer. But I have seem some technically correct dancers that were boring and who did not connect with their audiences. Ms. Mor connects like you were watching her in person."
1,Belly dance cheesecake,This is not a video for serious dancers. It features seconds-long snippets of sultry performances edited together to make one dance routine. Beautiful but comically revealing costumes.
1,Disappointment. disappointment.,"Buyer Beware--THIS IS NOT A BELLYDANCE EXERCISE VIDEO. Instead it clips of Amira performing in red at a banquet, in sliver in front of a screeen. It was cheap producation of various clips spliced into this video in an attempt to make it flow naturally. Super, super, super, horrible. While the music was good the dvd is a total waste of money as stated by another reviewer."
4,Beautiful Cabaret Bellydancer,"Yes this is a performance DVD. It shows Amira Mor dancing in various places. This performance contains a veil dance, wings of Isis dance, zills, and my favorite part the sword. I own all of Amira Mor's DVD's and I love each and every one of them because they will teach you floor moves, that are not performed as much by others. However I do have some problems with each one. That is why I will not give them the full five stars but four. The problem I have with this one is that while she dances to one song, the editing jumps from one dance to another. One minute you will see her dancing with zills the next, a veil. I did not like that. It done this through out the DVD. I think if they just stuck with one choreography for each song, I would have gave this DVD five stars."
1,Amira Mor cannot Bellydance.,"Bellydancing is not about making love to the camera, covering up a lack of real talent by acting like a stripper. Bellydancing is all about about ART. Unfortunately, there is no art present with Amira Mor. What Amira does on her video any untrained lady can easily do, there is no art to be found.I ordered this video in the hopes of watching authentic, professional Middle Eastern bellydancing. Instead what I got was a video of a woman acting in poor taste devoid of any real bellydancing technique, training or understanding of my culture and of the this very delicate art form.The editing was choppy, and it contains so much fluff and no beautiful bellydancing. I am very dissapointed with Amira Mor, her lack of talent, dance skill and video production.Do yourselves a big favor and order professionall videos and DVD by real bellydancers...this is all gingerbread and no substance.Thank you,Mdm. Katie ShenoundaEgypt and USA"
5,Diane Kennedy's the Bomb!,"I heard her speak at a recent eBay convention & she's a great speaker with great ideas. The book is a must-read for anyone contemplating selling on eBay. She is a professional with good, sound advice."
1,The product was compromised,The bottle looks old and prints on bottle are faded and not readable. The cap was sealed by a scotch tape to prevent leaks. It makes me suspecious that the contioner liquid was refilled into an old bottle.
1,This product doesn't work,"Waste of money, I had high hope. It's too bad that it didn't work because I was ready to buy more."
3,"Nice, but --","I have to agree that this is really difficult to hang on to & direct. I am not a small person. I do have arthritis, but that doesn't seem to be the problem here, it's the design of the handle, and the chrome doesn't help. The unit works fine but that is definitely a minus and I would not recommend the model because of it."
1,What a disappointment!,"What a disappointment! I brought this shower head, thinking it would be great for my husband, who only has the use of one hand. Two showers later, the head became loose, and when we tried to screw it back on, we discovered something inside was broken...no problem..so, like the smart ones that we are, we purchased a second one....This one did the exact same thing, and now we have decided let everyone know this is a badly constructed item...No more for us...onward to a better made product.<br /><br />"
2,Bring back the old style,The WaterPik inserts into the holder from the base rather than around the neck near the head. This places it annoyingly higher and above the reach of shorter people. Not happy with that change at all after years of using the older version.
5,M-A-G-N-I-F-I-C-I-E-N-T..,"There is no need to say much words. He is ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK..Thanks to god to create him..Biggest name , biggest voice , biggest performence everytime , everywhere.I purchased 4 DVD albums...I can't be satisfied with listening him one time..I'm his fan."
4,Very Fun,All that I have to say is that this game is exactly like the Arcade Version with added Modes of Play. This is a must get for Dreamcast Owners and House of The Dead game fans!
5,A must have for any shooting game fan!,"A must buy for any shooting game fan! House of the Dead 2 offers many modes of play and several secrets. Also, there are many different paths you can take throught the game, making it a long lasting title. It may be a bit to gruesome for small children, as you can shoot at almost any part of the zombies and they will be damaged in that area. For example-Shoot a zombie in the chest, there will be a gaping, gushing hole. You'll definately want to pick up a lightgun controller for this one. It is an easy game to play, but getting through some of the levels can be tough. I thoughrouly enjoyed this game, and think anyone who enjoys shooting games will too. A great addition to a gamers Dreamcast collection."
1,rent for the 15 min. it takes to play,I bought this game when it first came out. Game play with out the gun is impossable.. I finally got the gun. In less than 15 min. I finished what I thought was the first round to find I finished the game. I spent $... for the game + $$$ for the gun for 15 min. of play. Rent if you want but dont waste your money. Beleave me. dont do it. you will be sorry.....
1,Boring,This is just like an arcade game you play at a bowling alley or something. For those who like those kinds of games then maybe the game would work for you. But I found this game extremely boring and no fun
1,boring and not worth the investment,"I loved HOUSE OF THE DEAD in the arcade, but found HOUSE OF THE DEAD II for the DreamCast to be really boring and not worth the investment. Sure, it's only $40, or whatever, but you can't really play it without the guns, so tack on another $25. It's not worth it.The game play is repetitive and the animation and dialog between levels is painful to sit through. Buy Soul Calibur or Toy Commander, instead. I bought HOUSE OF THE DEAD II, played it for half a Sunday afternoon, and haven't played it since."
2,1 hour gameplay should be left in the arcade,"When I played HOTD2 in the arcade I was amazed at the graphics and great gameplay. In March after a bought a Dreamcast, I bought HOTD2 with a light gun and thought it would be better than the arcade with some new board or secrets. I was disapointed in the ORIGINAL mode which let you pick 3 items and then took you over to ARCADE mode. Thats Sega's idea of ""NEW""? Without the lightgun, you are lost and are stuck with the joystick which is hard to aim and is unreliable. The two player mode was okay with hardly any slowdown. Training is a great addition to the game and helps you find the best way to beat the bosses.Wait for OUTRIGGER to come out and till the price sinks down, hold out and save your money for the new 2nd generation games."
4,not a bad game but not the bet,"first of all, let me say that the game is quite fun and entertaining, BUT the voice acting is among the WORST I have ever seen. I mean the ATARI (origional) had better voice acting (completly silent). But all things considering, this game is worthwhile and is fun especially in two player mode! I think it is just worth 3.5 stars but I was being generouse."
4,Not perfect but fun,"I only have this because I have Xbox's House of the Dead 3.The House of the Dead 3 is better.Better graphics,effects,blood,gore,and options.I'd reccomend that one more.But if you are more pleased with House of the dead 2 and only have an Xbox then get House of the Dead 3,beat it,and go to The House of the Dead 2.There,you start at The House of the Dead 3 and go back in time in a time machine until you reach the year 2000."
3,"Entertaining, but...","This game is fun, but I must say that the replay value is about zero. Considering the fact that they already recycle all of the bosses 2-3 times, you can see where I'm coming from."
2,in the arcade you can spend as many quarters as you like,"HOD2 lives up to its billing as a fast action shooter. It does so, however, by ignoring everything else that a game should offer. Other reviews understate the necessity of the laser gun. The aimer simply moves to slowly to allow for any reasonable chance of success. There is no free will, or choice in this game. The only way gameplay affects storyline is to open doors that lead to diversions from the VERY scripted plot. The acting is a complete joke, leaving this reviewer wondering what was lost in the translation. Most disappointing, however, is the notion of credits. You cannot extend play for longer than nine credits, great in the true-to-the-arcade-game translation except that in the arcade no-one is going to limit you to nine plays. This creates a hopeless expectation of perfection to actually finish the game and dooms players to playing the first screens over and over again. not much fun."
4,The No Kill Human Gimick Annoys Me a Bit...,"..But it's a great game! The monsters are pretty creepy (HOWEVER I have seen scarier - look at Resident Evil monsters). The thing with shooting a human and lose a life is annoying,too. Sometimes you can't help but shoot someone (or by accident - panic is big pushover with this situation). When I first tried this game, a human ran out from behind the wall screaming ""Help me!"". PANICKED from his sudden outburst, I shot him, and I lost a life (it was my last one) and died. I went far, too!If I had dreamcast, I'd buy it immediately. Dreamcast owners - take advantage of the situation and buy this great game!**(I played this game in the arcade and almost beat it. I died by killing a human..unfair! unfair!)House of the Dead motto: Fear is not an option...I heard that somewhere before"
4,Mindless zombie-blasting fun,"House of the Dead 2 isn't built to test your literary skills, it's an action-shooter, plain and simple, where you blast zombies and other undead things before they rule mankind. For a game of its type, the graphics are actually very nice, showing smoothness and creepy enemy movements. The gameplay's where it's at if you have two of the light guns, but it's also pretty decent with one controller. I expected better voice acting, however...Goldman sounds like he's reading off of a Tylenol ad. In short, a great game, if not overly challenging. The extra modes will keep you busy for some time."
4,"Not perfect, but leaves you feeling good","The game is tons of fun, the training is really cool and makes you feel like military personnel out of a movie. The plot is OK, but the acting voice overs are extremely cheesy. The best part of this is that the replayability is fabulous, allowing tons of different paths through the game and a whole lot of secret stuff that you can find and reuse in Original mode. Definitely get the light gun, because it is really worth it. As far as the cheesy music and sound, I turn the volume down and play the Matrix Soundtrack on my sound system, or similar heart pumping, adrenaline rushing music and turn the lights down. Cool game, well worth the purchase."
3,fun but could be better,I love this game but when using the light gun I found it shot to the left a little thus I had to adjust. I also found this game was to easy my dad even beat I mean come on there is never any change and its not very fun because they tell you were to shoot the bosses.
4,"4 stars with gun, 1 star without",yo this game is pretty good with tight graphics and not so good sound but it sucks really bad without the gun to go with it cause the aimin takes a while to get used to but with the gun its like playin in the arcade. its much better than segas HOD1.
3,cool game but problems,this game is pretty cool but it has two main problems one it is extremely easy until you get to the magician (the final guys) and then it is practically impossible. and it is so cheesy when they talk. the graphics are pretty good.
4,DEAD ON TARGET..,"first off, the graphics are killer (pun intended) but this game is no fun unless you buy a gun. and even with it, you will still have a HARD time finishing this super chessy game.. the bosses keep coming one after the other, and if your gun doesn't come with an auto reload/fire, your'e done!! the last two bosses are a real pain in the butt. and the B movie voiceovers, are chessier than resident evils' acting (or lack thereof) a perfect halloween companion...""TRICK OR TREAT"""
4,The reason to own the DC light gun,"House of the Dead (the arcade) is the reason I bought a DreamCast. I played it at a local movie theater about 2 months ago and realized and I wanted it at home. I did a little research and found out that not only was a home version out, it was very affordable and a perfect arcade port.This game is great on the Dream Cast if you have a light gun, if you don't this game is not good. The user interface for the game was designed for a light gun, so if you play with a controller it seems unnatural and you have a desaster almost as big as trying to play Virtual On without the twin sticks. ...If you do not have the gun, strongly consider buying the ""Stringer Light Blaster & House Of The Dead 2 Bundle Pack"" by Pelican. ..."
5,I love this game!!!!,I really love this game. It is the best shooter out there. If you are going to buy a dreamcast then you have to have a copy of house of the dead 2 to go along with the system.
5,"Relieve the stress in your life, get this game NOW","This is the perfect game for those who love shooting games to relieve stress. The graphics are the best I've seen in a video game and the game play is quite challenging-- even in easy mode. There are also many different twists and turns the game can take, so no two games are ever alike."
4,Not as good as House of The Dead 1,The thing i like most about this game is how it makes you want to play it more and more. I like the new concept but its not even based on House Of The Dead 1 and its to short. But it also has very good graphics and works great with a light gun. The Hostages sound very bad though with there screams. But i really liked this game for the training missions and the original mode. But House Of the Dead 1 wont be out for pc for a while. (Unless u read this review after it comes out) But this game was a good buyer.
4,Linley and Havers - a delightful pair of detectives,"Havers has much more to do in this one, but where Havers is, Linley can't be far behind. They work beautifully in tandem, and this is another fine book."
1,bad not in the good way,I read a lot of books I had to throw this one away. I never have done that before
1,poorly written and a waste of time,This book feels like it was written for no other reason then to cash in of Left Behind's popularity. The writing is unfocused and hard to follow and the author certainly doesn't use his book to explore Christianity in any kind of depth or bring any insights into the faith. It's a waste of time from any angle you look at it. Try We All Fall Down or the Christ Clone Trilogy instead if you're looking for thoughtful books that explore the topic with insight and intelligent writing.
5,Great Thriller / Great Lessons,Ken Abraham and Daniel Hart have combined to create an edge of your seat thriller. Their take on the Islamic mujahideen's attempt to destroy the West and Christianity is right on target. The characters are fully developed and not card board cutouts. They struggle with real issues that anyone can relate to. How they struggle with their faith and ultimately find hope is inspirational. They've left the Left Behind books in the dust.
2,D-R-A-G-G-E-D A-N-D L-A-G-G-E-D,"Man, one thing I really don't like doing is to knock someone on their can for their effort. But if you want someone to get into your series, make it interesting, starting with the first book. I can most honestly say that I wanted to get into this. You look at the cover and it really looks intriguing and like a page turner. But to be blunt, except for a few parts, it is BORING, and Left Behind is still better! The difference is that Left Behind just gets into it. This looks as if it has trouble making up its mind.Now, I read the whole thing, but I wasn't impressed, and despite myself, I got Exodus, which I will read at some point in time. But if it doesn't get any better, then I'm not wasting my time. I respect the effort and the intentions, but at least make it interesting."
2,"Scattered, Hard to Follow, Could not finish it.","I wanted to like this. I am not a religious person, but I did enjoy the Left Behind series, I love end of the world books and though I'm not a believer, I find religion interesting for its relationship to history and its effect on society. This book however, is terrible. It is scattered and confusing. There is no flow at all. The characters are not believable or likable. Let me put it another way. If I had not had the book jacket to tell me what it was supposed to be about I would have been completely lost. As it was I was completely bored and confused. I made it about 1/3 of the way through before I threw it in the trash.I am surprised it found a publisher and for my own sake, I wish it had not since I wasted my money on it."
3,3+ Stars for Above Average Effort,"Abraham's series joins a now crowded pack of apocalyptic novels. His approach is strong, and he offers an intriguing mix of suspense, action and characterization. The way he hints around about a ""Prodigal Project,"" is clever. On the other hand, the vast array of character vignettes tends to slow down the pacing, and can be confusing after awhile. Ultimately, compared with Left Behind, it ranks about even--better at depth and mystery, slower at pacing and action sequence. Those who want the best of action and characterization-suspense-depth, might look to the Christ Clone Trilogy.Bottom-line: Strong effort, above average results."
2,"Slow read, not enough at the finish.","I struggled throughout most of the book having to make an effort to read the book. The book skips around developing several character sets. However, about half of the way through it began to pick up. I did not like the ending. There were too many questions left unanswered and it was anticlimatic. Of course the author intended to have us read the follow-up books, but there just wasn't enough at the finish."
1,Save your money and time!,"For those of you who are looking for something to read while waiting for the next book in the Left Behind series.......this isn't it! It is very poorly written with none of the character development of the Left Behind books. The story was either boring or chaotic. I found myself having to reread pages thinking I had missed something. Someone else said this book was poorly edited. If this is the case, I would like to read the parts that were not included because they had to be a better read than the finished product. My conclusion is that the authors tried to ride the coat-tails of Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. They failed miserably."
1,"Oh, the humanity!","A literary underachievement on the grand scale of a parking ticket. This ""Left Behind"" knock-off features an utterly forgettable, two-dimensional, stereotypical cast. The story line is weak, unoriginal, and lacks even a modicum of cohesiveness. If it's multitudes of protagonists' convictions were half as strong as their agnostic meanderings and doubts, it might have mediocre potential. It lacks a sound message. This book has the potential to be a great witnessing tool, just start it on fire and tell people about Moses and the burning bush.Poorly conceived, and poorly executed."
3,The Prodigal Project: Genisis,I am always excited to get a new christian novel and especially an end times but this book is so poorly written I find my self having to read pages two or three times just to make sense. I am all for this series but I think anyone getting into it should know the score. If you by any chance thought left behind was poorly written then just put this back on the shelf.
3,Good book,Very interesting and well written. Good story line and a fairly easy read. not my favorite but interesting enough. Would recommend for anyone who likes to read Christian fiction.
3,"Like left behind, but too slow","This book does little more than introduce the players and then stops short of telling the story. The Left behind books also tend to try to play it out, and tell very short bits, but more seems to happen in each book. It is very similar to Left Behind, but there are unanswered questions. Ivy, the mother of the disabled boy, calls her husband a beleiver, yet he is left behind as well. I like another reviewer found myself skipping over long descriptive parts to get back to the story, which ended before it really got started. It's not like it was too long to put more in the book, it wasn't very long at all."
2,Save your $,Very little information on where to hunt for mushrooms. (on the ground is about as close as you will get with this book) Some decent recipes but that's all you'll get from this book.
1,No substance,"This is a poorly written monograph by the claimed 'world expert"" on morels and provides only generalizations rather than specifics on finding morels. To sum up this book, morels are everywhere and someday you may find the motherload. Good luck."
2,No True Glory by Bing West,"The majority of the book is his opinion/belief of the political side of this battle & how things were handled in Iraq. By the looks of all the references, these opinions appear to be gleaned from newspapers which are more Liberal Right Wing. I do not believe the viewpoints should be taken as gospel. It was confusing & a bit hard to follow as he switched from the political action to actual combat. Which in my opinion should have been 2 separate books. What there was of marines in combat was quite good but in many instances not enough was said about a particular marine or specific battle. Having read 2 other books on the Battles for Fallujah, they were much better. I would recommend this book mainly to get more of an understanding of what all the marines went through to take this city and what little there is of individual marines who were in the news. I recommend any book that reveals the heroics & acts of valor of the military as they are all true heroes."
3,Where are the maps?,"I'm suspicious of much of the narrative. I think the narrative, to a significant extent, - fictionalized - maybe the author's intent was ""objective"" but the narrative still ""feels"" fictionalized.Three other observations -First, it's almost impossible to keep the characters straight without more ""internal review"" of how this multitude of soliders and Marines fit into the narrative - and the Kindle edition doesn't include an index to characters, etc.Second, the Kindle edition didn't include a single map.If I had edited the book, I would have included a series of maps for both the April and November campaigns.Without maps it's virtually impossible to follow the ebb and flow of the campaign narratives.Third, the closing chapter, summing up the ""significance"" of the Fallujah nightmare, seems to be a ""Republican"" assessment.I found the narrative readable - easy to read, exciting, revealing and quite depressing - a wasted effort in an unnecessary war."
1,Not accurate,Speaking from my own involvment this book is not accurate at all. The times and places and bravery is real but the story is very jumbled. I was actualy intervewed by Bing West and have to question if he actualy was listning. This book was written for officers by an officer.Semper Fi
5,OUTSTANDING,"This is an outstanding book that captures the strategic and micro-level of America's greatest battle since Hue. Besides being an excellent writer, Mr. West is true patriot and a great person.PKO"
3,Good read,This book was a good read. But some maps or photos would add value. I found myself googling for additional info instead.
4,Well written account of the hardships of battle,A good read on the hardships of battling house to house and street to street. Gave me a better understanding on the insurgency and the difficulties to overcome street fighting.
3,Didnt tell the whole story.,While the author tells in infinite details the events leading up to the battle for Fallujah in Nov. 2004. He does not present an honest account of the whole battle. How can he forget to include the efforts of TF 2-2 that cleared the industrial sector of Fallujah. They fought and died and were maimed just like their marine counterparts. They overcame the same hardships and prevailed. However they are not mentioned or given credit for their accomplishments. Was this just an oh oops or more marine revisionist history ?
4,Great read.,"It was another great read from the author. He also wrote a book, ""The March Up"" when the 2nd Marine Division made the initial push to Baghdad. I reccomend that to all aswell.This book gives access to what happened in Fallujah to bring on the Marines during Operation Phantom Fury in November 2004.The only set back the book has is that it was rushed to print to soon, and stops right after the major battles have been won. I would have like to read after action dialog, and how Fallujah changed since the battle.Also, he describes action in which one Marine was awarded the Navy Cross, the nations second highest award for bravery in battle.A good read for those who are interested in military accounts."
5,Outstanding,"There's not much to add to the preponderance of 5-star reviews already posted for this truly outstanding combat record. As a Vietnam vet, I can testify to the realism, empathy and perceptive writing of what will surely become one of the all time great books on American fighting men."
5,The Marines. The best warriors we have.,"Great book. Bing West certainly gave me a full and complete understanding of the struggle to take Fallujah and along the way I begin to see that this new generation of Marines were once again fulfilling a long tradition of exceptional warriors in battle. Bing West's writing is upfront, objective, clear, with the focus on the individual Marines. You will get to know Lance Corporals and Generals by name. But most of all you will come away with a wonderful feeling from the book, that there are these very special Marines that will come to fight for us with their lives when we ask. They are the best of the best."
4,No Glory in This Story,"I bought this book as a gift for our grandson who is in Iraq right now (he asked for it), but thought I would read it first. I read about half of it and gave up, because I was so disgusted with the way we mishandled everything. Politicians need to let the Generals fight the wars, maybe we might win in a much shorter time without so many dying needlessly. The book itself was very graphic in its descriptions, but that was expected. I guess I would have to say that the book was as good as it could be, considering what the author was trying to tell."
5,Incredible Book,Bought this book after a buddy recommended it. He was in the battle for Ramadi and said that the book was very accurate. It was interesting to learn about the politics in Iraq and the outside influences. Fantastic book!!!
5,"Finially, a book about heros.",Bing states that which has been long overdue. Our brave Marines and soldiers are second to none. His riviting account of small unit battles and the heroic actions of Marines and soldiers reads like a suspense novel. He goes back and forth between combat and U.S./Iraqi politics with great insight. Even though I knew how it would end it was still a page turner. I am eager to see the movie.
5,Beyond gripping,"This reads similar to Mark Bowden's ""Black Hawk Down"" but in my opinion, is even more gripping. There was so much going on in Iraq at the time, with the CPA and military seemingly engaged in the same mission with very different ways of accomplishing it.I read through No True Glory in two days. It's not often that I can't put a book down, but this was one of them. West described situations in such an incredibly visceral way that you forgot you're reading a book. It's as if you got transferred back to Fallujah in 2007 and re-live what happened there. An absolutely engaging, thoroughly convincing example of the politics and complexities of war. A must read for anyone interested in the genre."
4,a Marine Mom's view,"I have no literary critic's polished review to offer. My comments are based on pure emotion.I was compelled to read this book--my son was there for the November 2004 campaign. He made it home, but my friend Sharon's son did not. I owe it these men and their brothers to understand as best I can. It is not something my son will discuss, and this is probably the most I'll ever know about his time there. Reading this book was painful. Despite crying my way through much of it, I couldn't put it down."
5,"If you want a front line account of a major Iraq battle, this book is it","No True Glory takes the reader into the heart of all the major details involved with Fallujah. Each push is accounted for, with the amount of military action impressive. At the end of the book there is a very detailed account of the close in gun fight in the ""house from hell"" where many casualties are taken from a brutal insurgent stand-off, as they fight to death. I have read many recent Iraq books, and this one definitely gave me the best ""street"" battle depiction on what the action is really like. Another good book that is a must read, is ""Operation Anaconda."" Enjoy"
5,Today's Warriors,"I have read Bing's previous books and thought them excellent. This book, ""No True Glory"", is OUTSTANDING! In it he captures the emotions and feelings of the Grunts on the ground and takes us behind the scenes into the political intrigue that makes winning a war so difficult. One particular chapter, 27, is titled, ""The House From Hell"". It is by far the most intense read imaginable. You live and die with these fine young men and feel the anguish as they die. Anyone who does not feel emotionally drained, and mad, after reading this should pack it in. Semper Fi."
1,what kind of business you running,So when I bought this DVD online and the rating was for like new I expected some superficial scratches or maybe the box to be broken. Instead I get a deeply scratched updisc that does not play for more than a minute or two. I am very disappointed with the condition of this disc and have paid for the disc to be resurfaced and wasted my money. So I think I should be entitled to a refund.
1,Beatutiful but the instructions cannot be followed,The book is lovely to look at but the instructions are not at all clear. I attempted one of the designs and had to make 5 prototypes and create my own step-by-step procedure to get it done.
3,just a consumer,most of the rating I gave was from memory as a lot of these purchases were quite a while ago
3,if you want to be a cut-up,"Looking for ideas for creating a pop-up card I chose this book. My reaction to it is ""fair"". I am not an artist. The ideas presented I did not feel were that creative but, if implemented, probably offer ways to develop techniques for one's own ideas."
4,Great Ideas for Unusual Cards,Love the book with loads of interesting card styles and reasonably good directions for constructing them.
5,Making Cards,This is a great book. I have been using it to create my own greeting cards. My friends and family love it. Easy to understand.
2,Need better examples and instructions.,"I was disappointed in this book. I have been making my own Christmas cards for 25 years, am always looking for new ideas and I love pop-ups. I felt that the examples were, for the most part, uninspired, too contemporary, and not relevant to the biggest card-giving occasions. The instructions sometimes were too vague to complete the project. I really think the basics taught in Paul Jackson's ""The Pop-Up Book"" were much better even though he provides no patterns or specific instructions for the awesome examples he shows. I'm glad to see Jackson has put out another book WITH instructions. This book is okay if you want an inexpensive substitute but it really doesn't show the true depth of action cards nor provide any new ideas that impressed me. I want to look at examples and think ""Wow! I can do that!""."
3,would have liked clearer instructions,I have been crafting for about 40 years and felt the instructions for some of the ideas could have been a lot better. The ideas are great. Working through the instructions has often been very frustrating compared to other books I have.
4,A fun book,"There are numerous books available on making cards. They tend to rehash the sentimental, cutsie attitude towards card making. This book is different. It concentrates more on the structure of the card. It is beautifully presented with clear photographs and instructions. Fun for all ages and skill levels."
4,"Cards That Pop-Up, Fliip & Slide","Great book, although I found some of the instructions a bit tricky. Overall the book is very imformative on the different ways to make some interesting cards."
3,Get it for the title song.,"I had this record on vinyl years ago, and I bought the CD, principally to get the title song which can only be had by getting the CD. The song ""Walking in Space"" is a 12-minute tour de force, where the all-star orchestra delivers a succession of swinging solos which shake loose the glossy trappings of Quincy Jones's arrangement. The knockout punch is delivered by Rahsaan Roland Kirk who weighs in with a heroic, careening, manic blow that almost knocks the band off the stand. The rest of the album doesn't wear so well in the test of time. ""Killer Joe"" still resonates, but the rest of the songs feel languid and dated. The worst is ""Oh Happy Day"", which at the time, was a top-10 hit by the Edwin Hawkins singers. Removing the gospel lyrics may have seemed the right secular thing to do at the time, but in retrospect the song seems robbed of its spirit and comes off as the worst of bad muzak posing as jazz."
5,best jazz album...ever!,"This was the first jazz album I ever bought. For the last 40 years I have been trying to find a jazz album to surpass ""Walking In Space"". Guess what? It doesn't exist! This album is as fresh today as it was in 1969. Thank you, Quincy, for introducing me to jazz. This album (not ""Kind Of Blue"") is the best jazz album ever made. Go ahead, jazz purists...hate me!"
3,"Insufficient words, maybe good for foreigners or beginners.","First of all, I only had a vague idea what the book was about. Once, I got the book, my opionion of it was not so fantastic as other reviewers had put it. It does do what it says by showing example sentences of how to use the words with other words, mostly by adding adverbs or adjectives in front of the subject word. The 'dictionary' has very few definitions. Only when multiple meanings exist, it defines it, making it real cumbersome if you do not know the definition. But, that occurs only seldomly, because, there are only 9000 words in the book. So most of the words are familiar words. (Elementary level dictionary contains at least 50,000 words.)I would presume this book would be ideal for foreign students who have learned english vocabularies, but, do not know how to use them due to lack of experience in usage. Or, it would be a possible companion for someone who is writing at a beginner's level."
4,Climb harder than Freedom of the Hills...,"...but not to the extreme.This book is the second chapter in an aspiring alpinists handbook. I found myself over the years amassing a pile of pooks on running, fittness*, nutrition*, supplements*, advanced rock climbing, ice climbing, crevasse rescue, orienteering*, navigation*, avalanche evaluation, etc. This book would have saved me a few bucks by putting alot of this in one place.* = These are covered well in this book.If you know Freedom of the Hills like the back ouf your hand, have Extreme Alpinism and a good book on slightly more advanced rock skills, don't bother. If not, get it.Even with this book, you need a resource of some sort in avy eval and advanced rock/rope skills."
1,Poorly Written,"This book is poorly written and organized. Very little useful information in it at all. ""We expect you to already know this"", ""Read this book to learn about this"", and from what they do explain it is poorly described. There are far better mountaineering books out there, don't buy this one. I assume the majority of the other reviews here on Amazon are by Mountaineers Outdoor Expert trying to sell this book."
5,This book is well researched and easy to read,"I bought this book because I had been out of alpine climbing for 10 years and I wanted to get back into it. The authors are professional mountain guides but more than that, alpine climbing seems to be an integral part of who they are. I picked up a lot of very helpful information that covers everything from training, to equipment and boot selection, to alpine travel and avalanche knowledge. It is very suited to the Sierra Nevada range, where I do most of my climbing. This is the best book I have found on the subject."
2,Raw Organic Cacao Powder,"I have purchased cacao from wilderness family in the past years, and gave them a great review. However, with my last purchase a few weeks ago, I was very disappointed. When I recieved my cacao, it WAS NOT from wilderness family naturals. It was from a company I had never heard of-Organic Herbal Essence. It did not have the certified organic logo on it. When I contacted the seller, they said they ""shared"" a listing with wilderness family naturals. I have been buying from Amazon for years, and have never heard of this practice before. If it was stated up front that this was the company selling the product that would be different. I just thought I should mention this so that any other potential buyers would know what to expect when ordering this."
4,"Good goggles, not impact resistant","If any of you airsofters are looking for these goggles, DO NOT buy them. I bought them and shot them at 400 fps and they shattered. theres are not ANSI z78.1 goggles, but a lower grade for motorcyclists, ect.good goggles though, used them for fishing and they blocked the sun from my eyes quite well."
5,Great book!,This is not a new program or set of leadership principles with a little bit of Bible to help. This is a great study of how Jesus led during His life on Earth.
2,Not the best book on the Leadershp Principles of Jesus,"There are a number of good books in print which present lessons on leadership derived from the life and teachings of Jesus. Unfortunately, this is NOT one of them. The author spends so much time writing about himself and HIS understanding of the truth that Jesus gets pushed to the background.The book contains some good concepts (it would be hard to avoid them given the topic!) but overall, in my opinion, the book is too author-centered."
5,Armchair Archaeology,"Most of us will never go on an actual archaeological dig, especially an important one. This book is the next-best thing to ""being there"" at the great discoveries, excavations, and unravelings of the secrets of the past. The book includes Troy, Nineveh, Babylon, Ur of the Chaldees (city of Abraham), Chichen Itza in the Yucatan, and the tomb of King Tut. Silverberg gives a biography of each discoverer (such as Flinders Petrie, Howard Carter, and Heinrich Schliemann), puts the find in context of the events at the time, and relates its contribution to the development of archaeology. The highlight is actual excerpts from the journals/writings of these men themselves -- how they discovered their finds, what they thought, and how they felt. This is a fascinating and easy-to-read book -- a must-have for we armchair historians."
3,Ehh...,"I'm not sure what the raving reviews are about... I think this stuff tastes like vanilla ice-cream, not a vanilla latte.Sure, a low carb frapp is nice, but the coffee taste is weak. I was very disappointed after reading so many gushing reviews."
2,Could have been so much better,"This book had the potential of a great mystery. The lead character of Mo was quite interesting, funny and smart, however the story failed to capitalize on that. The small town was not well utilized and most of the characters seemed incompletely developed. Although the end was not predictable , when you read you realize that you are not intrigued enough to care what happens at the end."
1,Bad writing!!,"The plot is fair, at best, but the writing, especially the dialog, is enough to drive a person crazy! Obviously there was no editor involved in the publishing process."
3,Dialog and formatting Awful!!,"I was only able to read about one-third of this book before giving up and deleting it from my Kindle. I could have read through the stilted conversations if I could have figured out who was speaking.It might be a Kindle issue (which is why I gave it 3 stars rather than 2) but the back and forth conversations, run together on the same line, made me have to keep going back to figure out who was saying what.I realized it wasn't worth the effort."
2,Murder mystery series...again,Another murder mystery series. The murderer was hidden much better on this novel than in some other series. Good writing. Enjoyed.
2,"Murder She Wrote, Except!","This would be a typical story for the Angela Lansbury TV series ""Murder She Wrote"" except for an embarrassingly out-of-place intimate, description of sexual intercourse between a man and his wife that starts the story off. If you get past this short foray, the story is a mild mystery that is not difficult to figure out. If the story had been written by a novice you might think he was trying to prove he had taken high school sex ed."
4,Small Town Secrets,"In this very short, quick read book, Charlie the owner of a small town Wisconsin diner and town leader is found dead at the bottom of his basement stairs. The ruling of accidental death doesn't sit well the Monona Quinn, the new editor of the local newspaper. Deciding to do the Nancy Drew thing, she sets out to tie up the loose ends that the sheriff appears to not want to handle. Turns out that it's not that he doesn't want to, he just knows some of the town's secrets. Is it worth destroying the man's good name with the truth? Interesting start to Cook's series."
2,Run-on dialog is REALLY annoying,"I am 28% of the way through this book. So far it is decidedly unspectacular. However, I am getting so annoyed with several people's dialog being slammed into a single paragraph that I had to come leave a review. It's really disconcerting for 2 people, alternating in dialog in a discussion, to be depicted by just putting end quotation marks and starting the next dialog a space later. I don't know if it's the transition to Kindle format that has been bobbled, or if the author doesn't understand proper convention.But it's so annoying I'm about ready to bail out on the book."
2,Confusing,"Maybe I'm just old school but putting characters comments on the same lines as others is entirely too confusing. I read about 28% of this book and had to leave it unread. I read for pleasure, not to try and figure out who says what."
1,Are You Kidding?,"First of all, I must agree with the previous reviewer who was talking about the love-making scene being very textbook. Uh, yeah. And if the main character is the female ""Mo"" then why is that part told mostly from the guy's point of view and how good it was for him?Also, what happened to starting a new paragraph when a new person talks?! I can't follow the dialogue enough to figure out who is saying what.The descriptions of things don't add anything to the story line or plot. It just seems pretty pointless. I couldn't even make it through the whole book."
2,This could be a good book if the formatting was readable,"I downloaded this for free for my Kindle so I can't complain too much. I imagine this could be a good book. However, at 7% into the book I've given up trying to read it. The storyline seems good but between spelling errors and bad formatting I've spent most of my time trying to figure out which character is speaking and what they are actually trying to say.If they offer an updated version of the book with the formatting corrected I'll try again but for now I'm giving up."
2,Not very mysterious,This book was not much of a brain-twister. The mystery was easy to solve. The characters did not seem very interesting.
4,Satisfying as a home-cooked breakfast on a chilly day.,"Marshall Cook takes on a new genre with ""Murder Over Easy,"" and fortunately his comfortable flair for writing small-town characters crosses over with him. Small-town closets have some might big skeltons, and ""Mo"" is just the heroine to shed light on them. I'm happy to hear that a second Monona Quinn mystery is in the works."
2,Too expensive,My son loves it but I think it was was priced too high for the product. Had I seen/felt it in a store I would not have paid more than $15.00
4,SPACE OPERA THAT SINGS,"I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED GOOD SPACE OPERA AND THIS ONE IS TRULY WORTH A LISTEN. ITS A REAL SHAME THAT THIS TRIO OF STORIES NEVER MADE IT TO THE SCREEN BECAUSE THEY ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN A LOT OF WHAT HAS MADE IT THERE. A RARE COMBINATION OF CHARACHERS YOU CAN CARE ABOUT AND ENJOY AND A CLEVER, RATIONAL, AND HONEST PLOT LINE THAT JUST SWEEPS YOU ALONG. I HAD NO DESIRE TO PUT THIS STORY DOWN UNTIL I HAD COME SADLY TO ITS END, UNLIKE MANY BOOKS I HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO LATELY. THE STORIES CONTAIN INTERESTING REFERENCES TO OTHER STORIES AND CHARACTERS WHICH WILL BE FAMILIAR TO THOSE WHO ENJOY THE SPACE OPERA GENRE. ALSO ENJOYABLE ARE THE INTROS AND THE AFTERWARD BY THE AUTHOR WHICH GO INTO THE BACKROUND OF THE STARWOLF IDEA. TRULY GREAT FUN AND I HOPE THE AUTHOR RETURNS TO THIS STORY LINE AND CONTINUES THE SAGA OF THE STAR WOLF."
4,The Art of Connecting,"The CD was , imo, not completely new, as the offer said.It had already been opened, the cover paper was a (little) bit rumpled.However, that is my only remark. It is an amazing CD and to me, the content is much more important than the packing.On top of that, the delivery was much faster than expected, so I'm satisfied."
5,common sense communication improvements,"I work as a Communications Specialist... sounds impressive, but really it is all about listening...and this book gives real world examples and steps for improving how you communicate change in your company. Perhaps I enjoy it because it supports my own theory that a chat or memo from the CEO is nice, but who is the guy/woman? really?...the immediate supervisor is the one I interact with everyday... that person is the key to clear communication and the conduit to change.This is an easy-to-read book, presenting clear practical solutions."
2,Shame on white team,"I ordered a carton of 8 boxes. However, my experience has been disappointing. These are not good white teas. Those of you who like good quality white teas (loose needle leaves) would be best staying off from this."
5,Stash Premium White Tea,"I have been a Black tea drinker for 20+ years since I quit drinking coffee. I have had Oolong, Green, Red and other blends and kinds of tea. I am pleasantly surprised by the fragrance and flavor of this White variety. I usually drink 4-5 cups of Black tea during the morning hours and have replaced 2 of these with the White tea. I can envision the day where I will only drink this stuff.Try it you'll convert."
5,you will not want to put this book down!!!,Well this book was so good that I almost could not get my work done. I could not put it down. Buy the book it is great!!!!!!!!
2,Strong Love,"The book was a quick read but the ending was very predictable. All the characters were too ""nice and neat."""
5,She Did It Again,"Several weeks ago, I read this author's other title, For Love & Grace and loved it. Last week I finally got my hands on a copy of A Love So Strong and now I'm wrestling with the decision of which book is best. Kendra Norman-Bellamy was a name I'd never heard before, but with these two books, she has swiftly become one of my new favorites. She builds such strong characters and such engrossing story lines that it's literally impossible to tear away from the story without looking forward to the moment when you can get back to it again. I've been known to read just about anything from Zane to Stephen King, but Christian fiction has become a genre that I have embraced and I owe that in part to two of the best reads that I've had this year....For Love & Grace and A Love So Strong. I see there's another book on the horizon. I will definitely be waiting with open arms."
2,Not what others say it is,"I feel indifferent about other reviews up here. I think this book is just another fairytale romance novel with Christian values. There is nothing spectacular about the story or the writing that would make me say, ""Wow."" I just don't see why others are hyping this novel up so much. I don't regret buying it but I wish I had gotten another book instead."
1,Whats the point?,"This romance novel had a good premise but Ms. Blake could have told the story with more realism. There was no real plot. All you know is that the main character was cheated on and deceived by her husband and lost in the end. There were no clear developments and weak dialogue. This could have been a really good story if told with better dialogue, more character development and better narration."
1,New old batteries,Batteries were already over 2 years from manufacture and lasted only a few months more in our vehicle remotes. Great price for new batteries but I know now why.
1,Useless,"I purchased these batteries for use in a small, battery-operated candle - the kind that imitates a flame by flickering off and on. I don't think this is a particularly energy-intensive use. Batteries that I've bought for this purpose before have lasted for a couple weeks of continuous usage (more if I remember to turn the candle off). These batteries produced a feeble light, as though they were already nearly depleted when I began to use them, and lasted exactly 90 minutes before they stopped working entirely. I realize these were cheap and that you do get what you pay for, but it's also true that it's just plain illegal to sell an item that can't be used for the purpose for which it's advertised. These batteries are useless, and Amazon should cease dealing with the vendor who advertises them."
5,Good Stuff,"These seem to be the real Maxell cells. I was worried that I might get knock-offs, but they were the real thing."
2,Batteries were all dead,I buy my batteries on line to save a little from store bought ones. I tried every battery in the pack and none of them worked. Had to finally go out and buy a working set.
1,Dead on arrival!,"Once received, I used all 5 and only 2 worked. Once again, you get what you pay for. Next time, I'll purchase these batteries at Target when on sale."
1,never received them,"I never received the product. (ordered 3 months ago) I recommend you to go to any electronic shop and buy it cash or with credit card, then take it to your home."
5,"Good Batteries, Great Price and you save money in the end with 5 pack.","These Batteries work well. Not sure how long they will last yet. The pricing was very good so worth buying a 5 pack and having extras for later use. I have purchased Maxell Lithium Button style Batteries before and they usually have a very long shelf life compared to others. They do last for years in storage so I don't hesitate to buy them in bulk. In the end, I have convenience of extras readily available when I need them the most and I do save money. It costs more to make a special trip to buy replacement batteries than these cost in total. We can't know how long the vendor had them in storage but I have been lucky with them in the past so I would recommend them to others."
5,great batteries,I have a Junghans watch that requires this battery. It is hard to get to the battery. These arrived and were fresh and should last a long time. I would recommend this battery.
5,Battery,Very good battery that hold a charge very well. Inexpensive to buy this way. I recommend this product to anyone.
5,A great deal,"These batteries arrived quickly and have lasted a long time, beats buying them in the big box stores at ridiculous prices.I'll order these again and again."
4,Cheap watch batteries,There isn't much to say about this product. My watch needed a new battery so I chose these because they were cheap. I now have enough batteries to last me probably 15 years.
2,"Not bad, but by no means great.",So far 2 out of the 5 lithium batteries I purchased as a pack are no good. The two that are working in my remote are seriously weak and I need to be ~10 away from vehicle to work so I have reservations as to how long these will last. The expiration date on these are 2016 also.
3,Entertaining... but it definately feels like a novice book.,"I've read other reviews for this book and I can't quite say I agree with the 4 and 5 star grades.I love Knaak's books, Huma being one of my favorites, but this book bothered me because it FELT like his first book....which it was.The characters are full of potential and I would have loved to see them actually fleshed out more than they were. The book moves extremely fast and covers major events quickly then races to the next big event. No time is spent getting to know these personalities and that is a shame. Events and relationships just feel rushed.Just compare the relationship building between Huma and the silver dragon to Cabe and Gwen and you'll see my point.Outside of those complaints I loved the setting, the monsters, the fantastical nature of the Dragonrealm. It feels like a guilty pleasure if you are a tried and true fantasy fan and love your dragons and elves."
3,EXTREMELY abridged,"Alan Bennett is wonderful on this tape, but true Alice lovers will be horrified by how brutally the text has been cut. If you're looking for an unabridged version, this ain't it."
5,How To Restore Sanity to the College Admission Process,"The college admission process in the US today is THE rite of passage for young people from the comfort and nurture of family, school and friends into the world beyond. Unfortunately, it has all too often become a cruel one, not one that is helpful to the child's growth. All too often parents, grasping for the ""brass ring"" of a designer label college become overzealous and overly ambitious, beginning the college process way too early and pushing their children so hard that it harms their child and their relationship with their child. As someone who has spent 20 years in college admission and now 4 in college counseling in a highly compeitive school, this book has become the most powerful tool I've found in prodding parents of the need to stay sane and use a more balanced approach in working with their children. I hope to do a reading group with parents in my school using it as the text next year."
1,Disappointed,"We bought this tarp because we had bought a smaller one before. However when we opened the tarp to use it, we discovered that the tarp was 12ft x 20ft and not 12ft x 14ft as was ordered. In addition to that being the wrong size the tarp was joined and had a patch on it. It also had some holes and where the tarp was folded the creases were faded.It looked good in the package and since we did not need to use it immediately, it was only when it was opened to be used we discovered that it was a rejected or reconditioned tarp and not a new one. There was no way that a new tarp would be in that condition.We are disappointed in the quality of the tarp sent to us."
2,where are the captions!?,"I found the ""unofficial guide"" a better read. It is more pithy. In this book you have to plod through a bunch of boring stuff on the push to get the movie made. The majority of the few, uninteresting photos have no captions."
3,It's just OK,"This shaper is quite 'tight' but does not really 'shape' anything. The top rolls down for me, but I guess a lot of them do. This was just an OK, iffy shaper."
2,Didn't quite stay up,"I was really hoping this would hide the few extra pounds I'd gained recently. When I tried it on before the event I'd bought it for, I could not get the top to stay up on my ribs no matter what I tried. So, it didn't shape my waist or work for me at all. It's a good idea in theory, but not in actuality."
2,Not worth it,"Berkshire Curves Above the Waist Shaper While this shaper slims the lumps, bumps, and panty lines, it makes new bulges where none normally exist. The waist does not come up high enough and therefore gives you a lovely sausage link effect just below your ribcage. I am very short waisted so it is not an issue of me being too tall for the garment. In addition to the length, the waist rolls the second you sit down or even bend over to put your shoes on. Save your money, go to Target or Macy's, and buy a pair of Assets or Spanx."
1,Wrong size sent,The wrong size was sent and could not fit me. I gave it to my slim sister and seems happy with it.
2,Not true to size,"I wear a size 1x sometimes a 2x, so I ordered this in the 1x-2x size. The waist was so small that I would have had to buy a 4x-5x to get it to fit. This only good for someone who doesn't really need a waist shaper."
3,Not really worth the money,A pair of pantyhose would have worked just as well. It was shipped on time and had a low price.
3,Berkshire Curves Above the Waist Shaper 8049 - Nude 3-4,"Well I am 5'7"" and weigh 166 lbs. and this is way too small for me. I really had to struggle to get it on and it was so tight I couldn't wear it."
4,Works Pretty Well,"The first time I wore this, I was so impressed! It completely covered my muffin tops and the little excess tummy I have when I wear tight clothing. However, the few times I have worn it since then, it seems to be a bit looser and doesn't hold it all in as well. Perhaps if I dried it in a drying machine, it would take out some of the materials stretching, but I do not want to ruin it. Maybe I am the only one who has had this problem. So I will probably just buy a few more and alternate between them, and hopefully I can figure out a way to snap them back into shape."
4,great shaper,i Was searching for a shaper that is comfy and fits a plus size gal. Finally. I will be getting more. Thank You!
2,Poorly written,"I've read only the first twenty pages of this book, and it's difficult to continue because the grammar, spelling, and punctuation are so bad it's hard to understand what the author is trying to say. Granted, he's British and I'm American, and there are always differences in our respective spellings and uses of the English language. I'm fine with those differences. I've read other British-authored material, and done quite well with it, but the errors I'm talking about are just plain comma splices, stray quotation marks, unnecessary capital letters, sentence fragments, missing apostrophes, etc. I'll probably stay with it, because I'm quite interested in the subject, and I expect he will present some information I can learn. I am a writer, too, and it pains me to try to read this book. Unfortunately this book, self-published through iUniverse, is a great example of books that give self-publishing a bad reputation. An editor could have made this into something enjoyable to read."
4,Inspirational but not psychology,"This book is intended to be an inspirational presentation by an athletic coach or trainer, not a psychology book. So the reader needs to be a little forgiving at times about assertions with no citations for claims. I actually found the book useful, and I am sure the author can motivate an athlete or team."
3,egg nog nod,"Those of you expecting a Devo X-Mas record will be disappointed. This CD is more in line with Mothersbaugh's ""Music for Insomniac"" discs in that it is heavily (i.e., entirely) synth-oriented and very repetitive. There are only snippets of recognizable Christmas songs, which is good, but I didn't ""feel the spirit"" while listening to it. The music is rather obnoxious, but in a charming way. I probably won't play it very often, but I'm glad it's in my collection. Fans of The Residents will probably like this disc."
1,Not Much to Recommend,"If you're looking for music similar to Devo or to Mothersbaugh's Rushmore stuff, skip this. It's closer to his Rugrats tunes -- it's essentially children's music."
5,A grand adventure to encourage other sailors,I met folks who encountered Bill on his voyages. they all liked him. His video made me like him too. Good sailing stuff. Almost as good at encouraging folks to want to emulate him as the Pardey's Cruising has No Limits DVD.
4,"Overall, a good book","I used this book in an Advanced VB class I took at Austin Community College. At first, I got down on the book but the more I keyed in the examples and did the homework projects, the more I learned - even if things didn't go 100 per-cent as advertised. I find VB a very complicated and volatile subject. Some of the examples may not work but for varied reasons. One of the problems I kept running into was fixed by downloading Visual Studio SP3 from Microsoft. Others seemed to be inherent in VB - not the book. Keep reading and doing - it's worth it."
1,Very disappointing!,"I have a degree in mathematics; I am a teacher; I have been teaching all of my adult life. I am probably old enough to be your father - in some cases - your grandfather.I used this book for a course at a local community college. The authors may know the subject, but they are not teachers.I sincerely believe that you would be better of simply using Microsoft's documentation. That is bad enough. This book only compounds the confusion."
1,Incomplete Source,"Rather than showing how the pieces of the program come together, this book only gives snippets of the code and often the instructions appear to be incomplete or vague. Concepts as a result are difficult to understand and a person would need to be in a classroom where the instructor could fill in all the gaps in this book. Does not show any complete code for the projects. Disappointing"
1,A Terrible VB Book!,"This is an awful book! This is an awful, awful, awful book!!!The authors jump around from subject to subject never really tying up or clearing up loose ends they have started. They do not have a clue as to how to lead students from subject to subject. This is probably a typical case of two instructors / professors being given a book contract to write a much needed ""ADVANCED Visual Basic"" textbook for colleges, universities, and tech schools to teach from. Unfortunately, not all VB programmers can write or explain what they know. I found lots of code typos and errors. Better books are: ""Visual Basic 6.0 Advanced Topics"" by Ekedahl, ""Murach's Visual Basic 6.0: Beginner to Database Pro"" by Koop, Prince, & Murach, ""Pure Visual Basic"" by Fox, ""Visual Basic 6.0 Unleashed"" by Thayer, et al., ""Mastering Visual Basic 6"" by Petroutsos, and ""Visual Basic 6 Black Box"" by Holzner. There is a lot to VB. Don't expect to find all of the answers in one book!"
1,"Oh my god, I bought this!","This has to be the worst book I have ever used in my entire life. This author does not know the first thing about writing a text book about VB. He jumps around from subject to subject. He does not have a clue on how to lead student from subject to subject. And last but not least what is it with all the code typos and errors? Save your money, buy any other book on VB but not this one!!!!!!"
1,Don't buy this book,this book has Bad examples and little to teach the intermediate. Save your money and most importantly your time! back to the drawing board Kip!
1,Crapped out after the warranty expired,"This is definately a fridge you want to purchase the extended warrenty for. I had it for just over a year before it stopped cooling the items in the fridge. And since it has a manual defrost, it sometimes leaked onto my carpet and left mold in it's place. I found one other review where this also was a problem, so buyer beware! When I called the company to see if they could refer me to a service rep, they couldn't do that for you unless you were under warranty. So, it's a crap shoot all around."
1,do not buy!!!,mine worked fine for 6 months. then all of a sudden it was'nt getting cold anymore.called the company and they replaced my old unit.my second unit lasted 10 months before having cooling problems like before.don't waste you money.
2,Do not buy Avanti,"I bought one of their wine coolers. It broke within a few months. After two months of fighting, they finally replaced it. That one broke too and is leaking freon. Now they are saying it's out of warranty and they won't cover it. Most fridges have a 2-5 years on the basic system. Avanti offers 1. Most fridges are repairable - the smaller Avanti's come as a SINGLE UNIT and cannot be opened up and repaired. I would avoid these folks if at all possible -- buy someone else."
4,Partial review,"I have to say, I had to read a short story collection for my English class, I picked this one because I wanted something more modern, current and relevant. I got that and a lot more! I started reading various stories, not in order and I found out that this collection is full of Black protagonists. I didn't know the others but I was aware of the book, but having a collection like this is rare, all truly moving and touching...except...the structural errors that occurred throughout all the stories, there were strange indents, strange comma uses, it was quite hard to read. I just noticed these things, they didn't hinder the story or ruin the stories in anyway, just made them a little difficult to read. I don't know if it was part of the story or just poorly edited, its one of those things I think people should be aware of.On brighter note, this is a very highly entertaining, mind-opening and touching collection of stories, I truly must buy for all those short story enthusiasts!"
2,Concrete Mess,"This book is a bunch of short stories from several authors. some good, some just okay."
5,Great Reading!,"Concrete Jungle is compilation of stories that are well-written, interesting and real. Shannon Holmes is but one of the authors that have contributed to the book. Love, lust, lies... street life and hard truths... Concrete Jungle's got it! The best thing about this book is the variety of writing styles, ideas and energy. I couldn't put it down!"
3,Concrete Jungle,i think im the only one who didnt care for this book...or should i say a majority of the stories.. I enjoyed the Chucky G story the best...that wouldve made an excellent full page book..but the others were ...ummmm...hell im no critic so ill just leave you with that...but ill still support URBAN READING! ....
1,this might be a good carbon cleaner but....,it doesn't mention it is a minidisc lens cleaner!i bought it then found out it was a minidisc one!otherwise it might be good if you are looking for a mini disc lens cleaner listen to the other reviews but if you want a regular cd lens cleaner buy a different one!
2,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,Same old shoot 'em and blow 'em up claptrap that pollutes our movie and TV screens from dawn to sunset.
1,Inspector Coliandro is possibly...,"...the worst production I can recall in many years. The plot is stupid and dull. There are NO sympathetic characters at any level. The acting is over the top andat the Junior High School level. The direction is done with a baseball bat rather than a baton. Writing is about as amature as anything I can recall.All in all, Inspector Coliandro is a monumental stinker, worthy of negative star rating.The only decent thing is the font used for the sub-titles.Detective Montalbano this aint.December/6/2011In fairness (a major personal failing of mine) I felt that my harsh review of this project may have beenover the top and possibly I missed something that would rescue the film from the cherem where itwas dispatched.I dug it out of the trash barrel and replayed it again. giving it a chance.NO. I was correct the first time.It totally sucks. No saving grace. Nada. Effes."
3,time is misleading,"My daughter LOVES this video. The problem is it is the same handful of cartoons looped through multiple times. If it wasn't for how much she laughs, I would have given it 1/2 star."
1,DISGRACEFUL,Don't waste your money on this - worst disney videos I've ever seen or had the misfortune to buy. Needs to br rated zero.
2,Don't Buy it New,"I love Disney! Their animation department is tops and I love that they've started making new shorts (How to Install your HD TV) and started playing around with the old ones again (a la DTV in the 80s and 90s).In all respects the shorts on this DVD are top notch, they look better than they did when I was a kid. In that way the review would be a 5 out of 5 stars, however why must Disney now only see the Dollar Signs? Why not put more shorts out on one DVD instead of splitting them up on two? Disney has turned into a greedy money hungry corporation that looks for ways to rip off the average consumer instead of giving us our moneys worth. It would've been so easy to put the 'have a laugh' shorts all on one DVD, that would be worth the $12 I paid for it, instead of making me pay $24 for a handful of shorts.So in summary don't pay full price for these or you're gonna feel ripped off."
1,Pushed Back Again.Huh?,"Honestly...I aint tryin' to knock Tha Row, but they aint had it together since Pac got got,y'all. Kurupt's ""new"" release is only one of MANY projects on Tha Row that have been gettin' pushed back forever. And on top o' that...it's lookin' like you gonna have to special order it when it finally is released. My advice...you'd do better to pick up some of the re-released & remastered classics(and upcomin' Pac releases) cause that's all that seems to be keepin' Tha Row on life support."
3,Ok but not that good,"Ok album. Only some hot songs on here. Worth the money tho. Best songs are Calico, Throwback Music, Anarchy 87, and Homeboys. Rest of tracks are str8 and some are wack. Not as good as dpg's Dogg Food tho."
2,A Puppy Pound Crip? Wanna Scrap!?,"Seems like Kurupt duz really good with out DDDDDaz! Throw Back Muzic'86 was the only good hit on this whole Death Row Album, and you can't even sample it!? Like Eazy, ""I be like Scrappy Loco, cause Kurupt be yellin' Long Beach Rollin' 6-0 Blood & Puppy Pound Crip? Really Doe! Nutz On Ya Chin, All Up in this Philly Hoe!"" -Eazy-E (Wut Would U Do?)Anywayz, Against The Grain really is watered down compared to Kurupt's previous albums! Death Row Records present day, Petey Pablo (Blast!), Young Eastwood (Blast!), Suga Knight (Blast!), and that wanna be Locc Kurupt (Blast! Blast!), he was never 2pac's friend like Snoop Doggy Dogg was anywayz! Plus MC Eiht, Outlawz, Coolio, RBX and Kurupts old' partner DDaz has better solo albums than Kurupt! This album is a disgrace to West Coast hip hop, so ya know whats good for ya! (LOL!)"
2,its a sad day,"It's hard to believe that Kurupt could put out a shi$$y cd but this is crap. Two or three good songs after such a long wait for this to come out, what a joke. Don't we all miss the days of the real death row????"
3,Kurupt Can Do Better {3 Stars},"Kurupt's first studio release in four years seems sort of unpolished and rushed. The fact that this album was pushed back for three of those years comes through on some of the songs as they sound outdated with their generic rhythms and dated topics. The production is distinctly west coast and allows Kurupt to spew his trademark venom in vintage west coast fashion. Some of the songs start to sound the same toward the middle of the album and other songs tackle generic topics like ""beef"". That can make things seem dry and boring. Guest appearances include Eastwood, Young Tone, Roscoe, The Dayton Family, Spider Loc, Big Tri, Domination, and Tupac."
1,DEATHROW IS LONG GONE,Another nail in the coffin for Deathrow! THis time I think it's sealed for good. SO much for Kurupt and Deathrow! Don't bother waiting for this album it's never gonna come out
4,Take your ETX90 spotting scope with you!,This tote makes lugging around an ETX90 spotting scope much easier. There is one internal compartment and a zippered internal pocket. There is enough room for the ETX90 and a few accessories. Just don'r forget to bring your tripod...
1,Not good,rips skin along with hair...may be i didn't use it properly..i love Norelco T series and with go with it
4,You are in for a Treat Horror Fans!,This movie is sick! I mean that in a positive way. The film is German and quite graphic is the subject matter. If you have not seen this you are in for a real treat. Great Psychological thriller! Keeps you guessing until the final scene!
2,Garbage.,"This movie had so much potential, but then flopped early on. It was so boring I nearly turned it off half way through. Just not an interesting movie; it was boring, and drawn out."
4,Great gift!,"This was a gift for a friend's daughter's 2nd birthday. Even though it says it is for over 3 users, this was perfect for her. She giggles every time she opens the lid to the box. I definitely will have to buy another one for my granddaughter when she turns 2!"
5,so adorable!,Everyone young and old loves this set of active little mice! The construction of this newer model seems stronger than one I had gotten for grandchildren 10 years ago. They still love the puppet even though it is a bit worn. All three sets of my grandchildren have these little mice.
5,Prompt Service,I just want to compliment the fast service that I had when I ordered this book. It came in right when I needed it the most!
2,David A.,"I bought these tubes to pair with the Conti 4000S tires. The ride was great, until 2 days ago, when BAM like a rifle shot the tube blew up at the seam in the middle of the ride. I probably had about 200 miles on them at that point. NO puncture, no pinch flat, it just blew up. I pumped them up before the ride to 110 psi, I weigh 175 lbs and was 17 miles into my ride on a very warm day. I would not purchase these again."
3,"Same problems as ""The Client""","Good art, good basic plot, poor plot execution. The characters are too one-dimensional. This sequel to ""The Client"" suffers the same problems. What should have been interesting aspects of the plot, (SPOILER!!!!) such as: What are the consequences of BP's actions from operating on foriegn soil? What are the consequences in regards to Wakanda's current political turmoil? etc..., these are all addressed, but feel forced. The plot feels chopped apart into sections with no flow, and may have benefitted under another writer, or in a longer book. BP figures out the behind-the-scenes politics of what's happening in the US (which feels complicated for the sake of being complicated) and then immediately flies to Wakanda, and tears through his enemies. It just all feels to forced."
4,Works great,"Cleans the inside and underside of the disposal with ease, the only draw back is a rack to hang and store it from."
3,Rather disappointing second album,"Hammer and Nail was such a great album that it was almost inevitable this one would be something of an anti-climax. There aren't any really great songs on here, which must be a bit of a worry for Paul Thorn. Worse still, there are some really pretty weak, throwaway tracks (like What Do You Take Me For and Mood Ring) that are just padding. Too often he uses the same kind of verse (witty, quirky, full of references to Oprah Winfrey and stuff that'll get SO out of date) and just does a different chorus. The lack of a real live drummer on many of the tracks doesn't help either and while the production on Hammer and Nail might have been a bit mainstream, it was certainly better than the uninvolving sound on Ain't Love Strange. Still, Paul Thorn does have a great voice (though not much of a range, it has to be said) and this is not a BAD album... But... should've ben better. Much better."
5,Can you say durable?!?!,My dogs just love these chew toys! They are the best ones I've purchased so far. Extremely durable! My dogs are HEAVY chewers and nothing has lasted this long. Two things they like the most are the bacon flavor and the fact that the colored part of the rings move around when they chew on them. I would highly recommend this product!
3,When is this series going to end?,"The first 4 in the series were excellent, number 5 was very good, number 6 started to get boring. It has turned into a civil war series instead of a science fiction series. I think it's time for the tunnel of light to bring in another group of characters to interact with Keane and his cast of characters. That should liven things up a bit. Unfortunatly I'm sucked in and want to see how it ends."
3,"Long on Battles, Short on Story","Although this series is interesting enough for me to go out and buy all the volumes, I'm getting tired of reading one battle scene after another. It seems that if you open the book at random, pretty much any page you turn to has fighting on it. And I'd like more maps, please. Without maps and diagrams I find it pretty meaningless to read a battle description. It's getting predictable, too: just when ALL is lost for the humans, some super-human effort is made, and they triumph. I would like to read more about the characters, what they do when they're not fighting, for example. Also, I'd like to know more about the effects on the social organizations of the Cartha and the Roums of having made contact with such a vastly different social paradigm as the Yankees represent. I wonder if it's a male/female thing; I notice that most of the reviewers give all the books in the series 5 stars, and I get the impression that these reviewers are all men."
1,was not what i expected,The pressure on the rain setting is so low you have to keep it on the concentrated spray to really wash the soap out. Switching between the two causes a cold stream to come out for a second or two till it clears. Also it is not sturdy - when the showerhead is moved to a higher position it does not stay and falls back down to the lower position. I will be returning mine.
1,Flexible hose won't hold up,"First of all I was very disappointed when I received my Waterpik CF-203C Cascadia showerhead. It is all plastic! I do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs. I thought when I oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal. Sedondly, even with the head made of plastic, the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it. We could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall. We installed it repeatedly, following each step of the instructions every time, thinking we were missing something. I eventually returned the showerhead to Amazon."
1,"Looks nice, works horribly","My wife and I were very excited to use this showerhead. It looks great, and was pretty easy to install. However, once we turned it on, the water pressured on the rain setting was not the best. It took me a while to wash the soap off and the shampoo. It was fine on the massage setting, but my wife doesn't like this setting. Whenever my wife tried to switch between the two settings, the showerhead would leak and I would have to retighten it. Eventually, it wouldn't stop leaking at all. We haven't even had it for 3 months! I am going to return it and get something else. Big disappointment."
4,Lovely showering experience,"I used this shower head for the first time this morning. I didn't have any trouble with water pressure or leaking, and I didn't have any trouble installing it. I loved the way the water felt, raining down on me. The large size of the spray meant that my whole body was kept wet and warm through the whole shower.I don't know why I paid the extra money to get the chrome-colored one, since I think the white version works the same. This one does look really nice in my shower, though, which is all plexi-glass instead of having a curtain."
5,a quicker shower,I love this shower head because I have really thick hair so it normally takes 7 minutes alone just to get the shampoo out of my hair and during the summer i wash my hair twice because i am directed to on my bottle in order to get rid of the chlorine. So by the time I'm finished shampooing and conditioning my hair its been like 20 minutes plus if i need to shave. This shower head has cut my shower time back to 10 minutes because of the great water pressure and how much space it covers when washing my hair i just love it.
2,THE WINNER IS....,"I am a shower maniac and I've tried at least 10 showerheads this last year. Although some worked nicely, their lifetime was too short. I recently bought the MOEN REVOLUTION SHOWERHEAD. WOW. It's like nothing I've seen or felt before. Try it. You will not be dissapointed."
3,Good but not great.,"Even though it was gentle to my sensitve eyes, and did remove eyemake up, it did not do such a good job on the mascara, their own brand. I had to apply it several times and still ended up with racoon eyes."
2,Doesn't do a good job of removing mascara,"This doesn't work well at all for removing mascara. I use organic, all natural, non-waterproof mascara. It does work okay for touch ups - small smudges using a q-tip."
1,The worst Henna I have ever tried!,It added nothing. I purchased the Burgundy color and my hair was the exact same color. The few white hairs I had were still white. Don't waste your money and purchased from Arabic or Indian stores.
5,You can heal yourself!,"This book helped me to get the real issues around my aches and pains. It's true, your body really is trying to talk to you. Once you understand the message you truly can heal yourself."
2,Love Yourself,"It was not what I expected. Frankly, it seemed that similar remarks were repeatedly written for numerous situations, leading me to doubt the author really had any knowledge or insight to impart to me regarding these physical problems. I felt very disappointed about that. Someone had really recommended this book to me."
4,Healing from within,"This valuable metaphysical reference guide contains 20 years of research. The book deals with the effect on thoughts on the body, explaining that physical problems are the outward manifestation of disease on the mental and emotional levels. The physical body merely responds to these thought imbalances and by its symptoms sounds a warning of the need to return to the way of peace, balance and harmony in thought. The author provides simple techniques to correct wrong thoughts and to enable the reader to heal her or himself. The book includes a comprehensive guide to the causes of more than 500 diseases and illnesses and the cure for each of them. This is a truly impressive work that belongs on the bookshelf of everyone that is willing to take responsibility for his or her own health. Another great author whose books and audio books are helpful in this regard, is the wonderful Louise Hay."
4,Crazy 8's after 20 years,This is a must for all Crazy 8's fans.Having a great time listening to the different versions of the seven original tracks.There are a few suprises on the CD like the secret track #25. Their appearance on Star Search. This version of Johnny Q was worth the CD.Just saw the Crazy 8's in Seattle this Sept 2004. They still put on the best live show even after twenty.Small Venues & Small Crowds Rule!
5,Perfect for small jobs,"As should be evident, this isn't the cordless drill for hanging drywall or framing a house--but for small jobs around the house it has all the right stuff. Plenty of torque for driving screws into wood and drilling medium sized holes; just don't expect it to keep going for hours. We have used ours for almost three years and it's still going strong. As long as you understand its limitations you're sure to be satisfied. Its light weight and compact size make it ideal for smaller hands and reaching into akward spaces. I love mine!! But don't pay more than $50--look beyond Amazon..."
3,DON'T MISS THIS,FAST EASY READING FOR ANY AGE. A COLLECTION OF OLD GHOST STORIESFROM A TIME WHEN STORY TELLING WAS ALMOST THE ONLY FORM OF ENTER-MENT. THE BEST PART IS THE PAINTING ON PAGE 94. OUTTA SITE !!!!
3,Series written for children.,"This series was very entertaining to me as a child. I repurchased some of these books looking to re-experience the thrill. Unfortunately, this series is written poorly - and I can see it entertaining to youngsters - but as an adult the writing lacks depth and is annoying. It almost reads like a dungeons and dragons overview of worlds - than actual short stories or mythology."
1,Last Night,The movie won't show here. It is the wrong zone! I've bought a film from you before (under my mother's name) and that worked perfectly. Why do you ship a film to South Africa that won't show here? This has cost me quite a bit of money and now it's useless. I'm very displeased.
4,Two hours well spent.,"Creative, original, quirky and imaginative. Not a formula Hollywood product. Great performances -- this was the first time I ever saw Sandra Oh, and I was stunned at how expressive she is. It will have you talking about it for hours, and haunt you for years. If the last fifteen seconds of this movie don't put tears in your eyes, then you have no heart."
4,a hidden gem..,"you may have missed this movie when it came out several years ago. Now is your chance to watch it. It's the end of the earth (that is the basic plot), but what is interesting is how the many characters in this film react to this fact, and how they try to find meaning in the closing moments of their life. The cast is outstanding, the screenplay is sharp.Sarah Polley and David Cronenberg (yes the director) and the other actors give great performances- the sub-plot weaves in and out of several characters as they interact with one another and try to tie up the loose ends of their lives before the end.This movie also has the added benefit of making the viewer appreciate the value of his/her own life and enjoy each moment to the fullest."
4,Dark movie,"I really enjoyed Last Night but I think it should be carefully noted that this is very, very dark. Seriously depressing. I've seen this listed as a Black Comedy and I think that is misleading. While there are a few comic moments, this is absolutely a Drama film. Excellent showings from Don McKellar, Sandra Oh and Callum Keith Rennie."
3,A beutifully judged film...,"...that makes the best of its limited resources. And I never thought I'd get so emotional listening to Pete Seeger! A bit like the Cube in my mind - a good idea, extremely well executed, and not at all what you expect. However, absolutely rubbish DVD release - full-screen for one thing, the contrast is painful on the eye, and the sound is so low you have to turn the TV up as far as possible. Shame on you! I'm fed up of buying good films that deserve better treatment!"
2,"Film's brillaint, DVD sucks.","Why, oh why, would they release such a fantastic movie, a (studio-produced) art film in full-screen only?When I saw this in a theater, I was struck by the cinematography, but this DVD really ruins much of it. The expressive desolation of empty buildings and empty streets disappear with pan-and-scan.In other words, get a second-run theater to bring the film back one week, but don't buy the DVD."
1,wrong movie- no packing slip-be careful with ordering from Amazon,"Ordered Last Night, a different movie, was shipped this movie without a packing slip. Didnt realize it was the completely wrong movie until I open the DVD and watched it. Terrible movie. Be very careful ordering movies and books from Amazon, as what you order is not always what you get shippped."
3,"Excellent Film, Poor Video","While I agree wholeheartedly with the praise being heaped on the film, I was very disapponted in the video itself. The aspect ratio is 4:3, in other words it has been panned and scanned. Many people like this of course, and I applaud those companies that issue both widescreen and pan and scan formats on the same disc (or even on separate discs). There is plenty of room on this disc to present both formats, as the only extra that is included is a theatrical trailer (which is in the widescreen format). I hope that a better issue of this excellent film will appear. Five stars for the film, one for the video. ..."
4,It Makes You Think But....,"Interesting movie to watch. I gave it four stars because any movie that makes you think about the subject matter is a good movie in my book. This movie does this. However, the one thing I have a problem with in this movie are the songs played on the radio to the people facing ""the end"". Would this REALLY happen? What heartless DJ would play songs to their certainly depressed sad listeners like ""the last song"" and ""I didn't get to sleep at all"". Is that helping anyone? Seems to me they would play upbeat songs like ""joy to the world"" or Van Morrison's ""Moondance"". The music they played on the radio was the only thing I found NOT believeable in this film. No DJ in their right mind would play alot of music they played on the earths ""last day"". The titles of songs SEEM to fit, but in reality they do not. As the Titantic was sinking, the band DID NOT play ""the death march"", they played upbeat music. Other than the music, a good film that makes you think."
3,"No Drama, No Hysterics, No...Soul.","That's what it boils down to. A soul-less movie with quite a lot to say but with no emotion to say it with.We never do find out why the world is ending. Yes, this would have benefited by making us actually CARE about the people in the film. If we don't know why it's happening, then we don't really care. Dead end.Why 3 stars then? Believe it or not, for the soundtrack.During the film a radio station counts down the top 500 songs of all time and boy is it refreshing. This is the soundtrack of the life of humanity. It's NOT the top 500 critically acclaimed songs by those ""in the know"" or those who consider themselves better than everyone else; but the songs that most of humanity listens to... in other words, songs typically trashed by the critics but loved by the rest of the world to the tune of millions of records sold.Nice touch to the end of the world."
5,Different from other EOTW films,"EOTW meaning End of the World, of course. In this one, it's not like Miracle Mile, where there's lots of depression along with the mayhem. Last Night focuses more on human contact in the last few hours of humanity's reign on Earth. People are with others at the end here even if they hadn't planned to be, simply because we need one another. That's the whole point of the film. Quirky and Canadian and very entertaining."
3,"Brilliant film, subpar DVD, but finally in widescreen","I love this film and if you've found this page, chances are you do too. This DVD finally presents the film in widescreen, but not in anamorphic, as the box incorrectly states. Also, there are no bonus features. Not even a trailer. Sad. This fantastic Canadian film deserves much better treatment.Still, at least you can finally see the film without having the sides chopped off like the previous Canadian DVD and the two American DVDs.Incidentally, be sure you buy this edition -- ASIN# B0002XGJSW, release date Septermber 21, 2004. It is easy to get confused because ithe new DVD has the exact same cover as the old full screen version, a really stupid move by Alliance Atlantis."
4,i liked last night,"how many times has the hypothetical question been asked about ""what would u do if it was the end of the world?"". almost never is the answer, ""well i would be a hero and save the world."" this movie is not like ""armagedden"", or other apocalyptic films. instead it shows various popular more practical answers to the hypothetical question. whether it be spending time with family, spend time alone, fufill a fantasy (sexual or non), rioting, committing crimes, its all in here. wonderful performances by don mckellar (who also wrote and produced it), sandro oh, and my personal favourite sarah polley. i must admit i watched this movie because i am a huge fan of polleys, but it turns out i stumbled on a wonderful realistic film. highly recommended"
1,Tasting notes and nothing else!,I would not recommend this book unless you are a frequent auction buyer.It does not say anything about the viticulture or th vinification of the classic wines-just Hallidays tasting notes.
4,A good vieuw of Australia's top range,I like this book because of the great tasting notes and a very good vieuw of the top range in Australia.mr Halliday has a very clear way to descripe these wines.If you are a wine lover of wines coming out of Australia and New Zealand you should remember this authur.
4,These are good,These work well but I can not find the paper cups locally and must order them online making last minute shortages something you have to plan for. Keep your supplies up because running to the store at 8 pm when you run out will be futile.
3,Not a fan - pan bends easily,I like the size of the pan and it cooks just fine but the aluminum is VERY flexible. It even bent as I was unwrapping it from the plastic wrapping. I was able to bend it back easily but I wish I would have sprung for the slightly more expensive pan instead of going for the cheap one.
2,Nice Size Loaves But Less-Than-Desirable Quality,"I purchased this pan so that I can make snack-size cakes that fit better in lunch box containers for my kids. For that purpose, this pan is perfect: the loaf size is about the same size as a regular muffin but since it is flatter I don't have to squish down the top as I have to for muffins. The kids love the novelty of having rectangular ""snack cakes"" even though I just use my usual muffin (or cupcake) recipes with this pan.However, the quality of this pan is quite another matter. I was disappointed when I received the pan and discovered how lightweight and thin the metal was. It was dented when I received it and I have been careful when I wash and dry it so I won't create more dents. I'm keeping this but next time I'll stick with my tried-and-true Fat Daddio and USA Pans baking pans though."
3,too shallow,"This pan washes out easily, but it's rather flimsy, and the holesfor the mini-loaves are too shallow. Your loaves come out veryshort, and not very attractive."
4,Good speaker for the money,I really like these speakers. I hooked them up to an old Onkyo reciever. The bass was a little weak but an adjustment on the reciever helped. I think If these speakers were combined with a sub woofer they could really shine. Overall very good sound for the money and considering the small size.
5,Great Action Movies,"I'm a big Pierce Brosnan fan and don't understand why he's not a bigger star than he is. I've enjoyed every movie of his that I've seen, from movies like Noble House to Laws of Attraction to Detonator (both), he does a great job. I already had Detonator on VHS and couldn't pass up the chance to get both on DVD. Well worth the little I had to pay, both are as good as the much hyped Peacemaker with George Clooney and Nicole Kidman so if you saw and liked that one you should like the Detonators."
4,eskimos will grow on you,"simply,1 track = 1 star,blueGoa. 1 track = 3 stars,let it all out.all the rest are solid 2 stars.almost as hot as ""can you pick me up""."
5,Stellar Photography!,"The photography in this book is simply amazing - among the best I've ever seen in my life. It is a true shame that this book is out of print. If you are on this page, and you see this book for sale, I highly suggest that you buy it! It is perhaps the most classic, famous collection of de-classified pictures of the world's greatest airplane."
1,Really great pictures!,"This book, and its follow up ""The Untouchables"" (by the same authors), are by far the most beautiful books on the SR-71 and U-2, and , thinking of it, rate quite high on the ""Most Beautiful Aviation Book Of All Time"" list...! I hope this sounds not too enthusiastic, but these books really deserve it!They are far from being inexpensive, but they are worth the money."
5,very understandable,Great book for those who want to make their on fashion pieces.Very easy readable instructions. Can't wait to start on mine.
2,Disappointed- cover and 2 other outfits out of 40 are the only good ones,"What made me buy the book was the cover for the sarong. I thought WOW, I already had ideas. Then when I received the book, went through the pics, [which they give closeups on the stitches] I was thinking, [Ive been had] The poncho they have only 1 though I dont like the pattern it gave me ideas and the yarn Richesse et Soie impossible to get,which I want for the high content of cashmere, from K1C2, and the silk ribbon form Artemis, you can't even find I dont think they do any more. I was truly disapppointed and have entertained the idea of sending the book back. There is more accessories [wristband, small pouch bag, alot of edging] than there are clothing. I was hoping for sweaters, better designs on hats/scarves. Save your money! :("
2,ouch,Horribly uncomfortable. My feet still hurt from when I first wore them a couple weeks ago. I had another pair of Aerosoles I absolutely loved and were so comfortable so I was surprised.
2,This is a very comfortable shoe if it would HOLD together.,I love the style and the comfort of the shoe. And was VERY VERY upset and sad that it tore. Wore like 3 times and it tore in the front!
2,Poorly described - this is NOT just peat moss,"Based on what I can see in the picture, the lack of descriptive text, and the label ""Scotts Organics,"" I assumed this was just organically grown peat moss... it is NOT. This product is peat moss mixed with Miracle Gro fertilizer. Great if that's what you want, but it's definitely not what I thought I was buying."
4,i use some of this for vft,"If you read the back of the bag you will see that it is pretty much identical to the more pricy stuff. but it all depends on what you want to spend, if money makes a plant happy ill just buy a pot made of gold =) anyways this stuff is working good for me so far. I would recomend it.mirecal grow brand also makes perlite witch is also needed for acidic plants.hope it works for you as it did for me.sorry for the bad grammer >.<"
4,Not bad once you get past the beginning,"Jackie has the annoying habit of smacking her lips after speaking...once you get past this, it is a very relaxing cd, but have seen nothing divine or otherwise....."
2,Minimal Value for the Complete Novice,"Well that wasn't much help! I just read the whole book in about twenty minutes, and that was taking my time! To be fair, I did learn quite a bit about majolica, but that's only because I knew nothing to begin with. This is a very simple book. It includes a few short ""chapters"" that give only a few paragraphs each on general concepts--marks, condition, paiting, care, etc. It's biggest selling point is that it includes more than one hundred pages with one or two good quality photos on each. The biggest problem with the book besides its brevity is the fact that it does not contain the price guide it advertises. The author gives the price for each piece pictured, and that's it. What's worse, as far as I can tell or figure out, the prices don't follow the criteria the author outlines for value. He'll list one piece for $100 and then another for $250 that (by his standards) is less valuable. Very frustrating."
4,A good version of puss in boots,"My 4-year-old son loves this movie... I've had to rent it over and over from the video store, and am finally going to get it for our own library. This, as others have noted, is not your typical high-tech, Pixar quality animated film. But if you appreciate it for it's story and quaint story boarding-type animatics, you're in for a nice treat. One word of caution... there are some scary parts in this if your child is little -- skeletons hanging from trees in one part -- but other than that this is a fun video."
1,So repetitive information!,"I couldn't find any new valuable information, 97% of them already make perfect sense to d without any need to read a book."
5,A complete book on wealth building,No since Charles Givens More Wealth Without Risk has a credible author written such a thorough and complete book onhow to achieve wealth. Don't let this book collect dust on your bookshelf!
4,Good get up and go,"I started a small company three years ago. With all the economic stress we face today, it is easy to make excuses for why business plans do not always fall the way you want. This book was a good read as far as the context and topics....kept reading it for a pick me up and to get ideas for how to diversify my company service and start taking control of my business."
1,Nike Triax,"Terrible. 2003-2004 -Not recommended to anyone: Wristband fell apart, pod could not be calibrated (had to return to Nike Oregon after a long dispute with them concerning their still-in-warranty issue.) Was refused any help until I wrote the Attorney General for my state. A second pod was returned but yet falls out of calibration during ""timer"" values. Flips from ""12-hr"" status to ""24-hr"" status for no reason. A very expensive item: 230.00+ and certainly not worth it. The pod finally flew off my shoe during a run and was never recovered.I belong to a large running club (300+)and see none of this model on anyone. Please. Buyer beware."
3,Too Hot,"I love toothpicks, especially cinnamon flavored ones, but these are way too hot. The Thursday Plantation Cinnamon picks are much better in my opinion. The Mint flavor of this brand, however are AWESOME!"
4,Exactly what they say they are,"Good chewing sticks (not simple toothpicks) with strong cinnamon flavor. Some seem hoter than others, not sure if I am imagining. Some friends love 'um, others complain too hot, not pain, just burning their lips.I do get a slight (very) wood taste at different points, but just bit down hard on a wet spot and that problem is GONE."
1,Taste-T-Picks,I thought this was a little too hot for a cinnamon flavor. Almost burns your tongue. Couldn't deal with it for long. I wanted just a cinnamon flavor not a hot tamale.
5,Inexpensive Insurance,"I was hesitant to order a ""pricey"" plastic case. Now, I am very glad I did. The internals of the case are pre-formed to fit the ETX-90EX, Autostar controller, lens filters, lenses, barlow, T-adapter, and a few extra storage areas. The external case is adequate to protect the contents from a short drop. It also comes with two keys so you can lock the case. The locks are designed to prevent curious children from opening the case. The lock on this case would never prevent a theft. It is also convenient to have all your accessories in one spot! Prior to using the case I had the little boxes my accessories came in one big box. This made it hard to find the right lens during a dark viewing session. With the case I know exactly where each accessory is. I do not need to see it."
3,"If it was $40, 4 stars... But there must be something better","As may reviewers have said, it just seems cheep. A thin plastic case which flexes, with a basic cutout of your telescope inside. If it was $40, I would say it is great. But, at the price I paid from Amazon, I can't help but think there is something better out there."
1,Amazon suggested a wrong accessory,"they suggested me to buy this accessory but it does not work in my system... also, they did not return my money yet (more than 30 days since I asked them to return)"
4,Women: Images & Realities,":)I'm using this book for and Introduction to Women's Studies Class and I will be using it beyond the class. It gives a good sense of the discrimination, you feel more of a connection to the women around you.However, if you need to get this book faster to do not select t he free shipping. It takes too long to ship it, but after that I recieved it a day before it was estimated."
1,see clearly when you buy it,"I bought this book in Nov, however, I found it was the third edition. When I returned the book to the buyer, he didn't get any money back to me, which made me feel very angry.You should be more careful when you buy a book."
4,Leatherman Sheath,"This Sheath wasn't quite right for the leatherman I intended to use it on, had an older one it worked okay for. Good quality, and fast shipping. Would recommend if you have the FUSE Leatherman."
1,"Without reference, merit, or scholarship","I read this book and others including Tinkering Towards Utopia (Tyack and Cuban, Elusive Science (Lagemann), Teaching in America (Grant and Murray), and Reconstrucing American Education (Katz). I strongly recommend all of these other texts, but NOT this one. Out of nearly sixty books I've read for my qualifying exams -- I can easily say this one was a loss and waste of time.Ravitch's book is a poorly written history. It foremost displays a lack of significant understanding of existing literature in history of education and American history. In particular she shows an absolute misunderstanding of the development of progressive thinking as can be found more clearly in Tyack and Hansot's Managers of Virtue. She clearly mis-interprets John Dewey's philosophy, place in American philosophy and thinking, and most certainly his role in education.In short it reads like the USA Today version of American history. Inaccurate, misleading, poorly researched, etc."
1,Bad History,Ravitch's book and its quack version of public education and the progressive legacy can not be taken seriously as she is heavily invested in bashing public schooling through a number of right wing think tanks.
3,The Renaissance of Craft Brewing,"Bert Grant tells his story, in ""The Ale Master"", about his love of beer and how he helped to open the eyes of the world to the forgotten industry known as craft brewing. Prior to the 1980's, beer was pretty much a boring product with nearly all beer made in a similar fashion, using some grains and hops, but too many adjuncts resulting in products that are nearly identical in appearance and taste. Grant helped change all of that when he opened the first brewpub in Yakima Washington.This book is a little too short, but it is an easy read. There are also very lenghty footnotes on nearly every page. It would have been better if, instead of using all of the footnotes, the information would have been integrated into the regular reading.By reviving the microbrewing industry, Bert Grant has performed a great service to all Americans. Never again will we be forced to choose between bland, bland, and more bland when we face the beer isle."
3,Rim too thin,"This is a classic design that is wonderfully deep for a solid fruit pie. I make many, many pies and try to stay away from this pie plate because there is essentially no rim. It does not allow for the crafting of a decorative edge of crust around the outside. Makes it very hard to make an attractive pie. I love Pyrex and their regular pie plates (probably have 6 or 8 of the regulars) but not this vertical rim."
2,Disappointed,I did not realize that this video was an old version of Mickey- Donald etc. My grandaughter couldnt relate to the old style charachters.
3,disapointed,"I loved it. But it was NOT the complete novela. it was only about Ana Paula, Rogelio, Gustavo, and Rogelio sister. Nothing or nobody else. they skipped all the other parts that did not include main characters . I liked all of the novela while on T.V. not just part of it. Disapointed. :("
5,Lady Lazarus,While reading Lady Lazarus the author supplied numerous twists and turns that made it hard for me to put the book down. The characters seem like people that I could know. This novel will keep its reader involved with a well developed plot and characters.
4,Grandson Loves Puppet,The black puppy puppet is what our grandson wanted for Christmas. He loves it and everyone remarks about how real it looks. I have bought Folkmanis puppets before and they have all been of excellent quality.
5,Markel is unique,"It is years since I discovered new subtle and intelligent music like this. Markel is sort of a mix of Prefab Sprout and Tears for Fears on the lyric/song side but blends that with musical style that reminds of Steely Dan and Pages, sometimes even early Genesis but a lot more bare bone and explicit.Music for musicians I would say."
5,Fatastic Read,Shel spent many hours of research on this book and I had the privilege of proof reading this wonderful book. Shel made the characters come alive and I saw the places he wrote about and was in most of them growing up in Saranac Lake. I beleive O'Malley's was in the the restaurant the was known as the Blue Gentian and is now Corvos. I loved the book and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to know of life during the era of the cure cottages.
4,"Great for Beginners, Boring for Intermediates","I had high hopes for such a well-reviewd book, but I was uninspired when reading through this book. The patterns are rather dull. Some of the yarns are so bulky they look downright silly. And the sweaters are all very square-shaped with dull drop-sleeves. I just hoped there would be a bit more variety and challenge.But I'll give it four starts because for a beginner, I'm sure it's nice to find easy patterns that won't intimidate. And they DO advertise that these are bulkier-knit sweaters. I just wish you could see more pictures before ordering, because they are TOO bulky for my taste."
4,Good news for Beginning Knitters,"I only knew the basic knit and purl stitches when I found this book at the library. With two friends becoming grandmas I decided to try a baby sweater.""Julie's itchy fingers"" is a basic pullover that made me feel very successful. The instructions are clear, the photos and diagrams are helpful. Looking through this book I knew I had to have my own copy. I am on my second ""Julie..."" sweater and planning to try a new design with the next project."
3,So So Book,"This is my first knitting book and I was pretty excited to make a sweater for my daughter. Some of the suggested yarns are not practical for children, expensive and not machine washable. I also felt that the instructions could have included a bit more detail, especially for the variations. The patterns in the book are very cute."
5,great book,"I am a seasoned knitter who found myself with a lot of baby and kid sweaters to get out. I guess they come in bunches. Patterns are simple yet cute and work up quickly on larger needles. The size range is outstanding. All patterns go from 0-3mos to 3 yrs.If you are a beginner you will love this book. Nothing to guess about, clear step by step instructions. Don't hesitate. Mostly cardigans, pullovers and hats. All stitches and techniques clearly explained."
5,My Favorite Book,"If I had to choose only one of my knitting books to keep (out of about 50), it would be this one. The book is well worth the money. Most of the projects are easy to do and quick to knit. My 3-yr-old son loves his sweater that I knit from this book; it is his first pick of what to put on when we go out. And that says it all."
3,A beginner's book,"One thing that I find strange in this book is the choice of yarns. As a book that presents itself as patterns that ""knit up quickly"" I was expecting more bulky or chunky weight yarns. But many of the yarns are worsted weight, and you are supposed to double them. This increases the yardage requirements for some patterns. 800 yds of yarn for a child's sweater seems crazy! Why not use a heavier yarn? Of course a more experienced knitter will be able to substitute yarns easily, but the main group of knitters this book is directed to, beginners, may have some trouble figuring these things out. Just strange, in my opinion."
4,Great landscaping guide!,"The photos alone are worth buying this book! That said, the info on how to use stones in landscaping and gardening is very good. Maybe one of these days I'll even have enough money to actually DO some of this stuff.I recommend this book."
1,RIP OFF!,"This is a major rip off. I was skeptical to begin with but I thought, for 6 bucks it's worth a chance. I'm embarrassed to even admit I bought this crap. It consists of one page of HTML."
4,Wonderful Read,I enjoyed reading how the author expresses her thoughts and the words she chose to express them. Beautiful book and I would definitely recommend it!
4,sweet,"A very sweet, heartwarming film with some good acting and interesting characters. We would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice story with no violence."
3,I loved the actors,"But the movie dragged, I thought. Wonderful actors, they needed more depth in the writting.I always get movies that many of these actors are in"
4,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"We enjoyed this film. It is probably geared more for ""older"" adults as we can relate more to their personalities. If you are a young adult, this may not be the film for you."
4,Very enjoyable,"If you enjoy a story being told to you and not shoved down your throat, this is your movie. Obviously an excellent cast who know their craft. You see the characters not the actors."
5,This was a movie that gave more than I expected,"This movie was not what I had expected. It had a great cast of characters and the acting was top-notch. What was interesting to me was how the Director did such a great job at portraying and showing the growth and development of each character. Each character within the movie goes through their own transformation, and it is this transformation that allows you to get engrossed by the movie. Don't get me wrong though, this movie is funny and witty and has a charm that cannot be understated too. All-in-all this was a movie that was a hidden gem as it gave much more than I expected!"
4,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" meets ""Cocoon""!!!","Here'e The Lowedown on ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" (A Drama DVD review)...LIKED IT!Become a fan of ""The Lowedown"" on FacebookGenre: 8.5 Movie 7What's it about?British retirees travel to India to take up residence in what they believe is a newly restored hotel. Less luxurious than its advertisements, the Marigold Hotel nevertheless slowly begins to charm in unexpected ways.What did I think?This movie was ""Slumdog Millionaire"" meets ""Cocoon"". I found it a witty comedy with a great story. It's too bad I could not associate myself with anyone...save the hotel owner. I have probably said too much. In closing, this movie is definitely worth watching...just not sure I would see it more than once."
2,Oldies can also be shallow,"In the first place, this is not a comedy, as advertised. It's a soap. Worse, it's a politically correct and utterly superficial soap. Yes, the acting is marvelous, and so is the directing. The music, however, is irritating, and the script is sheer trash. Reading the warm reviews is most depressing, for one realizes how shallow our culture is, believing that life is about having a good time, especially if this means sex. And if you're an oldie, you can still have a lot of fun in the sack. Homosexuals too. This is right out of CBS daytime or HBO anytime. Sad."
2,Overrated,"How did so many great actors consent to be in this film, whose story is a mound of clichés and whose script sounds like it was crafted by an adolescent?"
2,Slapstick and hackneyed,Young hero overplays farcical role. Old people are sickeningly sweet. Overall everybody is a character actor trying to get attention. Yuck.
2,Not,this movie was not what I expected. I found it to be more confusing than entertaining. Can't win them all
2,snooze,"Nothing particularly special or memorable about this movie. It was dull, predictable and the dialogue wasn't even interesting. I truly don't know why this is up for awards."
2,a sleeper,"Literally, I could not stay awake long enough to really say if it was good or not.....oh well, can't like them all."
3,review,Was somewhat disappointed in this movie. It was not what I thought it would be. I found it rather depressing.
4,Lighthearted Movie,"I enjoyed this movie very much. It was the tiniest bit slow-moving, but it was pretty good. A nice, lighthearted movie to pass the time."
3,best exotic marigold hotel,I was a bit disappointed with this movie. I expected more comedy and a happier story. It focused instead on relationships and some issues of growing older. As one who is growing older I would have preferred a lighter look at growing older and more laughs. Lord knows us older people know the downnside of growing older. Give me something to laugh about before I go toes up.
3,best exotic marigold hotel,"This movie was so-so, mildly entertaining, not going to purchase this movie, or see it again. The acting was better than the story. so I did not hate it but surely won't see it again..."
4,Great Movie,great movie- loved it-have recommended it to co-workers/friends and family-a must see for everyone-hope you enjoy it as much as we did-
5,Feel Good Movie,"Delightfully charming. A lot of faces I recognized, too. Excellent acting, good story line and I good finish. Over all a good time spent."
5,Great Feel Good Movie,A cast of great actors. It's just a pleasure to watch them interact. You smile when the movie is over.
5,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,I haven't seem this movie so cannot comment on it. It was a gift for my mother and she enjoyed it.
4,Sweet Feel Good Movie,"An entertaining look at aging. Some romance, some health issues, and some strife all linked together with a feel good ending. The actors are all on top of their game."
4,An entertaining movie,It was a very nice movie. Good story line. Some of it was not too original and yet it was entertaining.
5,Would give it 6 Stars if I could.,Maybe you have to be over 50 or 60 to fully appreciate this film but to my mind it was a complete joy. Right up there with Peter O'Toole in Venus. Anything Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith has gotta be good. Loved it loved it loved it.
3,started slow,the opening was so slow we almost fell asleep. It was amusing in places but was not as we expected. Not one to watch again.
3,Nothing special,"A decent, but very bland movie. Only rent if nothing else catches your eye. Nothing objectional, but nothing exciting at all"
5,Great movie,"Love British movies. This was one of my favorites. The actors were fantastic, location perfect, script was sad, hilarious, and feel good."
5,Best movie of the year.,Best movie of the year. A wonder for the senses. The wonderful changes in the charactors. Fabulous acting. I loved it.
5,Great Movie,This movie has a good story line; great dialog and acting. All around very enjoyable! I recommend this movie to anyone over 40. Younger viewers might not get it.
4,Great movie for more mature audiences,"This movie starts off a little slow, but if you hang in there it is a treat to watch. I liked it, husband loved it, so I bought it for him for Christmas. He said he wanted to watch it again. The younger audience might not enjoy this movie as much as the more mature audience not because of its rating but because of the content, I really don't think younger people would understand it."
4,A Fun Movie,This is a fun movie that intertwines the stories of several lives. There are a lot of solid actors that deliver good performances. It pulls you into their lives and you share some fun and sadness. Worth renting.
5,Watch it!,How nice to finally see a movie that dealt with people over 50. An outstanding cast which also included the young Dev Patel. Highly recommended.
5,The Best Exoctic Marigold Hotel,"This film is warm, human, honest, and funny with some lessons to notice, as well as visually pleasing.The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a winner."
2,"Good start, lousy finish","The movie starts in a promising way, also considering all the good actors in it. Then, it becomes boring until, in the end, it disappoints. )("
2,Not My Favorite,THis was certainly a surprise! I expected it to be better! It was slow and plodding and predictable! I gave 2 stars for the scenery. The country was lovely. Don't bother!
3,its ok,I didn't enjoy the movie. And the movie keep getting dark so I have to push a button on my remote to get it bright again.
2,Movie review,I had read about this movie and from what I read I thought it would have beena really good mother/daughter movie. Well! I watched over half of itand had to turn it off. I can't believe that a producer or directornot to speak of the really good actors would have taken part any this endeavor.I wasted my money.
2,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,The Film had a life lesson but it was awfully slow and nothing exiting to keep U interested. The setting was beautiful but the film was nothing special.
1,star dust at it's finest,"This movie has an incredible cast to cover up the fact that there is no story.Sometimes an all-star cast is so much fun the story doesn't matter, not so in this particular case.This movie is long and boring because it challenges the boundaries of age, sex, race and class so unrealistically it is not to be believed. In fact the only interesting thing about the movie are all of the positves reviews. I wonder how many people would like this if it was'nt sprinkled with so much star dust. Personally I detest this sort star studded, no story kind of movie that tells you what to think, but I can't help but notice how good it has made so many older people feel, and I can't help but wonder why they can't make beautiful, tender, well acted movies with star studded casts of older actors and believable scripts so that all people can enjoy."
2,Not worth $10,"I really hate to pan this movie, because I loved the premise and most of the actors for other work. But, this cast never gelled and the plot dragged on. Worse, the set was depressing and it never got much better. In fact, it made the whole idea of retiring in India seem much less appealing, and that was only from the visual and sound track.I found the entire movie a waste of time. I kept hoping for a memorable scene that would make the experience more positive, but it never came. This isn't the worse movie ever, but it hardly is worth your $10 to watch it."
2,poor story line,"Good for an evening of mindless distraction. If you are into intelligent dialogue or clever story, find something else. It is sad that older actors are willing to accept such roles."
4,THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL,"THE PICTURE WAS EXCITING AND TO THE POINT ON ALL PEOPLE INVOLVED... AGAIN GREAT ACTING AND GOOD STORY, GREAT FOR OLDER CROUD, AND RECOMMEND TO ALL"
4,Very cute,My husband and I found this very entertaining. Being close to the age of the Marigold Hotel residents there were parts that were a little TOO familiar but that made the movie that much more entertaining.
3,Curious approach to retirement,"We heard many favorable comments about this movie before we rented it. Perhaps that was the problem and we had high expectations of being entertained and provided with many laughs. In reality, we felt the movie was a stretch, an over the top and far out place with odd rooms, worn out old folks and some silly laugh lines. Basically, we felt sad in the end for those who had hoped this would be the ideal place to retire, and for us as well for hoping it would be full of solid enjoyment."
4,All my favorite British actors/actress' in one neat package,"I laughed, I cried, then I laughed again.Really good movie, enjoyable and I was able to share with my friends, as well.I had rented from RedBox, and felt it deserved a spot on my shelf, where I could watch it again....and again."
5,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"This has become my absolute favorite movie. I'm only in my 40's, but I find I can relate to some of these characters very well - young and old."
4,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,Very good movie. Great cast and locations. Made me think of what I am going to do when I get old...
4,Enjoyed the story,Well with retirement saving and medical costs we may all up living in the Marigold Hotel. I think it will be ok.
4,Entertaining and thoughtful,A nice story set in an exotic land with an outstanding cast. Heartwarming but probably wouldn't appeal to young viewers.
4,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"I have not yet received the product, but have seen the movie and it was very enjoyable. I highly recommend it."
3,hmphf,"I have one word.......BORING!!! Great actors, slow boring story. I was very disappointed with such a great cast, I could not get into this movie at all."
4,"Great story, but a bit drawn-out","What a cast! The story is told with a wry humor (Maggie Smith delivers some great lines, as always). While I enjoyed the movie overall, I found it a bit too long... as the end approached there was as much relief (that it was over) as eagneress to see how it all worked out."
4,"Light and mildly amusing. A bit ""chick ish""","I found this worhtwhile and relaxing, with a few chuckles and some interesting topics. definitely a chick flick. Nothing too disturbing. Kids and most guys would not like it."
5,Loved it,"A wonderful story of learning how to grow; of change, of loosing and finding love, of acceptance, of changing one's attitudes and beliefs, of making new friends, of life and death, of growing old."
2,Interesting,"Story exemplifies the meaning of the word hope. The acting was pretty good most of the time with a. Few great moments. Over all though, it was a bit corny. Would I watch it again? Perhaps if there was nothing else to do. I watched it in the first place because several of my wife's friends said we just had to see it. So, it would have to be said the reviews were mixed at our house."
3,"Ok, Not great",Predictable and bit sappy. Some good performances. Disappointing script. English retirees move to Indian Hotel for Seniors in order to stretch their limited retirement incomes. Hotel manager has forbidden love affair with an employee in an Indian call center. Its a comedy with melodramatic elements and a little Bollywood thrown in for good measure.
4,"A great ""feel-good"" movie.","Enjoyed this movie a lot. Characters were well-acted. One really did have to suspend disbelief, however. The people of India are indeed wonderful and warm. India has a rich culture, is exciting and exotic. However, you will not find the streets of India as meticulously clean as in this movie (yes, I've been to India twice as a medical volunteer). All in all, a fine entertainment."
3,Less than expected,It changed to dark comedy after being funny and light at the beginning. Several people had told me how great a movie it is. I was disappointed.My wife liked it less than did I!
5,Really Good Movie,I hoped this movie would be at least acceptable but also thought that the weekend special price made it okay to stop watching if it was not so good. It was really good and the cast was fantastic.
3,Interesting Observation,"A eye opening wake up call for those entering into retirement years. Also a reminder that no matter what our personal circumstances may be we can always find a way out and a way to enjoy our life. Brought together by a variety of circumstances each character deals with the circumstances in their own way. It was entertaining, sad, joyful and beautiful."
3,Good Movie,"I enjoyed the movie...it started out a little slow, but I was interested to see how the characters & their stories developed."
4,A little pleasure that makes for a good time,"There is nothing compelling about this movie, other than superb acting and a small little self-contained world that makes you feel good. The premise, essentially the outsourcing of the latter portion of our lives to a different country, may or may not seem a little strange, but what makes this movie so good is how it makes you feel. The actors are all fabulous in their respective roles and somewhere deep in you, not matter whether you want it there or not, they touch a nerve that makes you feel good. And, in this world, what more could you want?"
3,Not What I Expected,"I liked all the characters, but I was expecting a light and funny film. This seemed somewhat somber for my taste."
2,Wasn't keeping my attention,"I thought it was going to be a better movie. It was okay, wouldn't watch it for a 2nd time."
4,Good movie,This is a good movie that should have received more attention. A great cast. Just knowing Judi Dench is in gives you a hint of the quality of actors.
3,Not as funny as I expected,"The cast is great and I love stories that take place in India, but it wasn't quite as amusing as I expected. I'll still keep it in my collection and probably watch it again."
2,Go Exotic India,"India. Not my favorite setting, despite Judy Dench;s marvelous performance. Wouldn't recommend unless your ties with India are more fulsome than mine."
2,Boring,I fell asleep though my husband made it to the end. Never took off for me even though I lasted at least three-quarters of the way through. Yawn.
2,Seniors acting like college kids in a coed dorm.,"Friends recommended this movie, so we saw it. I was disappointed. Not funny. The setting was a retirement community in a formerly luxurious hotel in India. The script had the aging characters cavorting with one another like college kids in a dorm with horny oldsters bed-hopping like the ""hook-up"" generation. Stupid fantasy."
2,"Great acting, ridiculous story","My husband and I were very disappointed in this movie. It starts off well but as soon as the young man shows up, it all goes south. Apparently very few movie makers want to do a movie exclusively about older people (one example of how to do it well, The Bucket List) because here we have a silly side tale of romance and parental disapproval suddenly appearing. As if that weren't bad enough, it quickly begins to build romantic connections among the elders too, even a gay one (to make it up-to-date, I suppose). Then, to keep from offending anyone, they kill off the gay man so they don't have to take that storyline anywhere meaningful. It was like watching a bad episode of Three's Company with wrinkles. Honestly, it was a waste of well over two hours of our lives."
2,Beauty IS in the eye of the beholder.....they say !!!,As exotic as this movie was with all the great actors.....it cinched in my mind... this is a place I definitely will not add to MY bucket list......Just too damn drab and a horrific mass of poverty driven humanity. !!!!!
1,"Great Cast, Poor Plot","I'd heard good reviews; however, the movie was quite disappointing. The cast is exceptional, and some good development goes on with the characters, but the plot left my wife and I feeling like we had wasted our evening afterward. The overall message of the film is likewise subpar--something like elderly hedonism, where everything turns out your way. The line repeated over and over in the film is SPOILER something like, ""Everything works out in the end. You know its not the end if everything hasn't worked out yet."" Disappointing."
4,Terrific movie,"We loved this movie. It was very well-made, very interesting. Judi Dench and Tom Wilkinson were great. The photography in India was gorgeous."
5,I love this movie.,This is a great feel good movie with excellent seasoned actors. I love the interactions between the British hotel guests and the young Indian hotel manager. :)
4,The best exotic marigold hotel,I enjoyed the best exotic marigold hotel. The pictures of India and the Indian people was so beautiful and interesting to see.
4,"Fun, witty, great acting from the ""old dames"" of the UK!","A great laugh! A ""curl up on the couch"" with popcorn and a few good friends to feel good movie - loved it!"
5,Excellent tale of friendship over adversity,A charming tale with an all-star cast perfect for their roles. Friendship oversomes adversity and lush colors of India's culture as well.
5,Review The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"I loved the movieThe cast is great, the subject so contemporary (baby boomers can not aford to retire so they are finding a ""Mexico"" of the ""British"" nature - IndiaThe hotelin India is not the ""Hyatt nor Marriots""but becomes more than that -becomes the ""glue""which binds this group of British retireesIt si a nice story - yes some tears some laughter - some tears and all ends wellNot a movie for all audience but I loved it (I want now to go and explore India -on a moped...)Bolywood meets British ""stiffness"" and blends."
5,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. So enjoyable, I saw it twice at the theatre! Love all the actors. Please, make more of these kind of movies!"
5,A Delightful and Insightful Movie,"A really well done production. Humorous, insightful and a pleasure to watch.A cast of suberb actresses and actors, who got it right."
5,Aging with grace (and sometimes without),A wonderful celebration of aging with a first-rate cast. Maggie Smith delightfully departs from her usual aristocratic character; Judi Dench and Bill Nighy take on the strange with imaginative resolution; Penelope Wilton is wonderfully wilting...anything else would spoil the plot.
5,Classic British movie,"This amazing cast is just splendid, all consummate actors, they give this story its heart and soul. Had to own this movie."
4,Best exotic,"Great ensemble acting. Good story. It is filmed in beautiful India, Almost like a vacation. Anytime you can watch Maggie Smith AND Judi Dench, go for it!!!!"
4,Old people having fun.,Campy look at what sometimes happens to older people when the chips are down. The Indian backdrop make for some interesting cinematography.
2,Didn't understand the plot,"Couldn't understand what they were saying. Some of the English movies are like that for me. I do enjoy watching English Movies, especially the Series. Their stories are more of my era."
2,lack of taste,"What I was told was British humor left me cold. the setting was beautuful, but with all the great actors, I expected better."
3,Some good stars,"Some of the character development seemed odd to me. However, I'm a Judi Dench fan & her role, at least,seemed plausible most of the time. The scenes of India were interesting, too. Saves buying a ticket if you're curious...."
5,Marigolds Forever,"This movie was thoroughly enjoyable and as one who is in this age bracket, totally believable! I would recommend this to anyone of any age. There is truly something for all."
4,I WISH I COULD GIVE IT A 5,"All my favorite actors in one movie. I was so hopeful the script would live up to these actors' abilities. No such luck, but the cast still made the viewing worthwhile."
4,Marigold Hotel,"Great characters and a movie about real people, real circumstances. It was a refreshing change from the high tech, high sexed stuff that the theaters are full of."
4,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel: Dev Patel steals the show.,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is an entertaining film with some amazing scenes. Since I am clueless about British cinema, I wasn't really watching for the main cast as much as for Dev Patel who did an amazing job as the idealistic hotel manager. Patel lends grace, warmth, and charm to his character and commands every scene he is in. The other highlight was Judi Dench, whose acting and narration made the movie stronger than it would have been otherwise. An unexpected plus was the music on the main menu of the DVD, a very soothing treat for the ears."
4,Great cast!,I enjoyed the story line for each character. What a fun experience for most- the ones who don't enjoy experiencing a new and different way of life just stay out of the way. No need to be judgemental of those who do LIVE.
5,BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL,Great movie featuring some of the DOWNTON ABBEY actors in very different roles! The film is best suited to an older audience.
5,"Not an ""Old People"" Movie, An ""Everybody"" Movie","I heard that this was an ""old people movie,"" but I love many of the actors in the cast so I had to see it despite not being ""old."" I am glad I didn't listen. This is an ""everybody"" movie.It's funny, honest, visually beautiful, and peaks into so many universal aspects of life that any adult will be able to appreciate it. Other than the main Indian boy, the acting is top notch. If you are feeling a bit depressed, unmotivated, or stuck, this might be a good movie to watch. It's very hopeful and uplifting. I highly recommend it if you can do without explosions, sex, violence, blood, and cursing."
4,Thought provoking film,"Wonderful cast. Demonstrates to those who are not seniors that life does not stop just because you reach 65 plus. And to seniors, demonstrates that you don't have to curl up and let the world go by."
3,Great for old people!,"It was a little slow, but I can see how a senior citizen or older person would really enjoy this movie."
3,not as funny,all the funny parts are really on the preview making this movie seem a lot funnier than it really is.
4,Really Good Movie About Finding Happiness,This movie has some great stars. The story is about some British retirees who can't afford to retire at home.They start an adventure when they decide to retire to India. Makes you smile.It also makes a great point about happiness being a choice.
5,Fantastic movie,This was a fun movie for the middle-aged crowd. Great performances by some of the greatest actors ever. Makes you want to go to India.
4,Thoughtfull,The subject is best appreciated if you have had elderly parents to care for. The acting was memorable except for the young indian hotel proprietor who I thought overplayed the part.
4,Depressing.,The acting is fabulous but the message is very depressing. Difficult to follow character roles but I won't watch again to figure out the story.
2,Bollywood/Hollywood Stew,"It was interesting to see a film blend a few localities in India with that Bollywood touch, such as the westernized exuberance of our young hotel part owner/manager. That storyline was then interwoven with Hollywood style characters, mostly British retirees, seeking a place to reinvigorate their lives. The overall concept had potential for some creative interweaving of cultures but unfortunately the subplots for each of the retirees as well as for our hotel manager came out as artificial as a Hollywood tele soap opera. A formula box of cliché/stereotyped characters. The hotel manager's love for his girl friend who works as an English speaking phone telemarketing rep; the untouchable servant; the various dynamics amongst the British; all not only were written like a ""cheap paperback novel"" but the acting for each character came out ""too acting like"". Very contrived."
2,Great Cast - Bad Story,"Great cast and pretty well acted. But the story was not much to write home about. Guess I'm a traditionalist and when the tale involves a gay man reconnecting with his lover, a wife dumping her husband, an old swinger struggling to pick up a babe for a one night stand and so forth all set in a run down Indian hotel my interest fades pretty quickly. Whatever happened to honorable people even in old age determining to do the right thing? Not in this movie. Wish I had my $3.99 back."
3,"""Bollywood meets Merchant Ivory""","Bollywood meets Merchant Ivory in this reasonably pleasant film which, perhaps, is more successful as a travelogue of modern day India as opposed to an intense dramatic experience. It revolves around many quirky and eccentric characters with the intent of providing some moral uplift and inspirational feel. Political correctness abounds. Yet, I have no trouble recommending it as a rental for a quiet evening at home."
2,Film Not Worthy of the Cast,"With a host of actors associated with great performances over the years this movie proved to be a surprising disappointment. The story line is predictable, shallow and built with one dimensional characters that play all the stereotypical roles of modern Hollywood movies. Keep your expectations low."
3,Exotic only to foreigners,"This is an ""okay"" Western film about British expats retiring at a run down hotel in India. For the person who daydreams about world travel it will certainly seem exotic. But for those of us who really live outside of the West, it is a bit passe - but no more so than Dev Patel's other cliche-ridden flick ""Slumdog Millionaire."" (Which, again, isn't an Indian movie - but merely a British movie ABOUT India - and from an outsider's perspective at that.) . . . It's nice that non-Indians who made and watch this film seem to like India. That's why I don't rate it any lower. It's not a pukka Indian movie, however, which is why I don't rate it any higher. . . . It's just okay in my book."
2,bad sizing,annoying so much i wish it would have been the right size for my screen i really am upset with this performance
2,the best exotic marigold hotel,A big disapointment because your service did not provide closed captions as the web site indicated it would. We were misled and should not have to pay for the service. The movie was probably quite good. The service was very poor.
2,Boring Movie,"One would think with all these very good actors that one would get a good movie, or at least good acting in the movie. Guess again. I fell asleep 1/2 into the movie and when I woke up, I hadn't missed anything. It was boring when fell asleep and was boring when I woke up. The kid from Slumdog millionaire really proved that being directed well brings out good performances, which was true for Slumdog; not so much for this movie. The idea was cute but skip the movie. The trailer has all the highlights and anything good in the movie. Save your digital dollars on this one."
4,Good Movie,This is a very good movie. A simple story that comes alive because of a great cast. Two thumbs up!
4,Good movie,"Great cast of movie characters. The movie was witty, amusing, and worth the watch. I highly recommend it as gift or for yourself."
3,The Best Exoticd Marigold Hotel,"My wife and I thought the story of the movie was good, but for out likes it had a little too much ""city traffic"" in the movie which was disturbing. Overall it was OK. The actors did a good job."
3,Interesting movie,"This was an interesting movie, though some parts a bit vague and the ending somewhat trite, if you watch it, you may say at the end..well is this what starting anew and finding yourself is really about?"
4,overall good movie,A bit of a downer as older folks find themselves on unanticipated hard times. Their circumstances lead to unexpected conclusions and a good ending. We liked the movie.
5,Beautiful Film,"Stunning, heart-opening movie starring senior citizens...well, primarily. Anyone will enjoy this lovely film about humanity, culture, aspiration and perspiration. A keeper!"
5,Loved it!,"I gave this film 5 stars because it was perfectly delightful. The acting was superb, the story was enchanting, the photography absolutely glorious. I highly recommend The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel to any one over 55. It will make your heart smile."
5,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"I loved it. Good story, great performances by all. And of course, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench are my favorites. It helps that I identify with the age group. ;^)"
3,Enjoyed performances from some top players.,"Worth a look. Boomers will like it. Youngsters will yawn. The location of India is quite nice. Maggie Smith is wasted here, though, but she does a stellar job as always."
4,good flick,Anytime you get a decent movie without a lot of violence its a winner form me. I would watch it.
4,Comedy with a theme,They have shown what funny things can happen in India with the message that the selfless love of the people and the warmth can win you over. A definite watch.
3,Marigold Hotel,"Movie was ok but moved a little slow. Enjoyed it, parts of the movie made you laugh, but would not watch it again."
3,good acting but only fair development of characters.,"I did not think that this movie developed the characers enough but, as there are 8 main characeters, in fairness the movie would need to be longer to do so."
5,Good Show,"I gave ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" 5 stars because I liked the picture. I recommend it to Judy Dench fan."
4,Charming and touching film,"I love the impression that you get of India in this film - the sounds and colors, the rush of people, and you can almost smell it. The ensemble cast is a bunch of venerable pro's - I will watch Judi Dench or Maggie Smith in just about anything and I certainly wasn't disappointed with their performances here. I believe the film got mixed reviews but not from me. It's a life-affirming story about the capacity to change and evolve, even when you are elderly and beautiful."
3,Thought it would be better,"It was OK. Liked the cast, but the story was a bit weak. It is still interesting and has some good messages about what to expect and not to give up on life as you get older."
3,Fun movie to watch with your girl friends.,Very entertaining and fun for women of every age!!I really enjoyed it and would watch it again many times.
4,Fun with old people.,Something different. No car chases. The actors are English and the dialogue is too. Dependable performances from the actors. I enjoyed it.
1,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,Movie skipped on my Kindle all the way through the movie. It did the same thing with On Demand. Think it's a defective movie all around.
1,English accents difficult to understand -movie dumb,"The setting of this movie had some beautiful and not so beautiful shots -It made me sad that the characters had to live here -maybe the English found it quaint but at 61 -I could not imagine a more distasteful retirement -now an American retirement to Scotland? Maybe. The actors were familiar for the most part but the accents were very strong and difficult to understand. In full disclosure, I have difficultly with foreign accents. I gave the movie to my parents, who are in their 80's ,to watch -they are major Judi Dench fans. I wish I had rented it for a bargain price -I paid way to much. Not a fan."
3,Great Cast of Characters,"I love all the actors so I enjoyed the film but it did drag quite a bit, though best at the end. I enjoyed it but it was not great."
4,Kitchsy film,"I thought the movie was entertainlng! I'm not a professional movie critic, so I won't delve into a professional critique of the film. Easy to watch, funny & poignant moments, I like actors the along with the Indian backdrop."
4,Cheers for Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,Acting excellent - enjoyed plot and staging.I did not like the packaging - wondered if it were an authorized copy as it was so flimsy!
5,"Great flick for the baby boomers""","Great cast and very realistic characters. They are all retirement age, and for various reasons, (financial, loneliness) are looking for a place to which to retire . They settle on a defunct hotel in India advertised as a retirement hotel. It was a family owned business which the youngest son is trying to resurrect. The new ""residents"" have various reactions to being there - some adapt, some don't. A very heart-warming story."
3,"Entertaining, but not more than that.","With such a high powered cast I expected more from this movie than what it delivered. The story line was predictable, the acting was good, but not great and the relationships between characters were a bit contrived. Never the less it was entertaining and worth the $0.99 it cost to rent it."
3,Over-rated.,I found this movie to be slow and boring and not at all what I expected. The premise sounded like a comedy but it really isn't. The characters weren't likeable enough to hold my interest. Can't recommend this one.
4,"subtitles would be nice, and also adjustable screen size","I wished they gave us subtitles (English). Also, my slow computer didn't handle full screen presentation well, but the only other option was the original size, which was tiny. I wish there are some middle options."
3,"A bit scripted, could have been funnier ...","After hearing about this movie on NPR I was rather keen to watch it.While it does show a few British retirees out in India, it is not quite the comedy it was portrayed to be.Seeming terse or scripted in parts, this movie could have used so many cultural clashes for mirth.It is not bad overall though, with a good ending and many poignant moments thrown in."
4,Out sourcing old people.,"The best exotic marigold hotel has wonderful talented British actors.I loved the line ""America is out sourcing their old people"" ok that might not be the exact line but you should get my point.I give this movie a thumbs up and suggest it to every age."
3,Liked it overall,It's a heartwarming movie. The Brits save the day. Was not too crazy about the overly dramatic acting of the Indians.
4,Fun movie with a point,"If you are a little older and maybe thinking about retiring, maybe even in another country, this is a great movie. Funny, serious, and occasionally poignant.A very emjoyable evening on the couch movie. I recommend it."
5,Delightful,Loved this movie and all the characters. Would probably be very enjoyable for folks who are near retirement. loved it.
3,the best exotic marigold hotel,"Over all it was a good flick, but the story was a little weak for such a great cast, and the script could have been fleshed out a bit more for my taste. There were several areas that even thestar studded cast could not help, leaving me to think it might have fared better under the skills of a different director, but it still falls back to a weak script,and,or story.That being said, another might find it quite enjoyable,it does have it's moments with great scenery and feel of the country."
4,Sweet and realistic,This was a sweet and realistic story about aging and what life is about once raising children and career focus are out of the forefront. Enjoyed the idea of their adventure in India.
3,Boring!!!,It was a very predictable outcome with very little story line. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it.
4,For the Young at Heart,"Hooray for a film that treats seniors as ""real"" people with the foibles and triumphs of all ages. The characters are individually well developed while surrounded by sights and sounds of a culture different from their own and interesting to the senses."
3,Nice show,"Been to India several times. I find India more conservative than this program. But then I do not frequent the more decadent places.I did not care for the obligatory immorality relationships in this story, that seems to be required nowadays in today's features."
5,the best movie in a very long time,perfectly cast in every way. one character is performed better than the next and so on and so on.truly a class act! loved each and every minute of this movie.
5,LOVE IT,Got this for my better half and we both love it. Judi Dench is an outstanding actress and she really makes the movie
2,"Sappy, predictable, pretty scenery, and so disappointing","This was a film I was really looking forward to seeing. It has some of my favorite actors and I love films which take place in India...so vibrant and beautiful. But the plot is beyond cliche' and so ridiculously sentimental, I found myself rolling my eyes again and again at the stupid lines actors such as the wonderful Dame Judy Dench and Maggie Smith had to say. If you want a mindless ride through India, don't mind the stereotypical characters, and silly predictable plot, then you'll like this film. If not, then rent it...don't make the mistake I did when I bought the film on Amazon Instant."
5,Judi Dench and Maggie Smith,I enjoyed this movie and will indeed watch it over and over. I am glad they will still make movies that doesn't have only in mind the very young. We older adults like good movies that are not trashey. Thank you for making possible.
5,A Lovely Surprise!,"This is a must see for anyone over 50!! Younger viewers would certainly enjoy it, too, but the message for older folks is invaluable: Aging is about turning another chapter and seeing what is next in the story--NOT about closing the book and giving up! With all the great reviews, I was expecting the film to be good, but was delightfully surprised at just how good it was! With a cast of heavy hitters and a wonderful script, it couldn't lose. By the end of the movie, I wanted to jump up and go see what I could go out and get into! lol"
3,Good not Great,A pleasant jaunt to another land with mildly intriguing characters and a plausible story. Innocuously entertaining but not much more.
2,"Movie ok, previews misleading","The movie was a good movie, however the previews led me to believe that there would be more comedy in the movie."
3,.could have been better,"I had high hopes for this movie, especially given the actors involved. However, it was without much of a plot - very predictable. Not much depth."
4,GOOFY PLOT,I LOVE this movie! Ten stars for production and location. Ten stars for cast and acting.The fly in the ointment is the shallow plot. Thirty minutes of revision would have fixed ALL of what's wrong with the movie.All that time and money spent on a bad plot...
3,Exotic only,"This movie was filmed in exotic India and while one thinks it starts as a good tale, it dissolves into wasted talent of otherwise marvelous actors. One thinks it is about aging people, but it dissolves into the story of an aging homosexual looking for his old lover in India... the old Indian dude had gone on to marry and have a family... and the gay dude dies. Parts of it were very pretty, some lines were hilarious and some scenes touching, but it's not something or appropriate subject matter for young children."
3,"Oh, it's okay","This is a nice enough movie with the usual themes: the Indian hotel manager is a buffoon, the caste system is unjust and the Europeans address the injustices somewhat, and one man's searches for his sometime homosexual lover. Couples break up and couples get back together. Scenes of India are okay; not much dramatic. Yawn."
3,"just ok, enjoyed scenes of India","movie was ok though a little slow. ending predictable, but sweet. did not enjoy the gay character aspect, could've left the old flamer out, but i guess that's just a sign of the times, every program must have their token gay."
2,Not what I expected,"With such great actors I expected it to be a humorous fun adventure to India. It was dull and rather depressing. I bought it as a gift (unseen) for my father-in-law who just entered an assisted living home. I finally got around to watching it and was so disappointed and worried it would depress my father-in-law. I advised him NOT to watch it. It may appeal to some, but if you are looking for light humorous fun then I would suggest you skip it."
2,Good actors doesn't mean good writing,"What are these Amazon reviewers thinking? There may be fine actors but the writing is beyond bad, it is all so canned. Goes to show that it takes much more than good actors to make a great production. I tried to watch this with my wife and her parents (we are in our thirties, they their sixties) and we have diverse tastes in movies -- we all had to stop watching 30 minutes in. Do not waste your time."
3,Not as good as the movie I had in my head,"When I saw this cast, I immediately created a great movie, but this was not it. Close but not quite. Frankly, a bit of a waste of a great - I mean, GREAT - cast. Too bad. Worth watching to see these cagey and likable vets do their thing, but keep your expectations under control and you'll not be disappointed."
3,Not that funny,I thought it would be funnier than it was. It is geared more for the older generation and their particular problems and how they cope with them.
5,best movie,How these older women do such a wonderful job at their craft with no botox or facelifts should be an inspiration to all young actors
5,Well done!,One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Great acting. Dealt with some serious and sensitive topics via humor but none over-shadowed the other.
3,Pretty good little movie with great cast.,We've watched the actors in this cast for many years and enjoy watching what ever project they choose to do. It's a good little movie but it's lacking something that would make it great. I'm not sure exactly what it's lacking but at the end we felt the movie was unfinished. We were expecting a comic movie but felt a sense of sadness at the end. I would recommend this movie based on the quality of the cast if nothing else.
5,STARS IN ALIGNMENT,"We had seen this film twice in a theater, but our house guest had no idea as to what we were talking about. So we streamed it. Movie was again terrific. Streaming worked as it should. Fully recomended."
3,It was pleasant,It was entertaining. Not great but it was pleasant. Maggie Smith is wonderful. She plays obnoxious so well - almost too well.
3,somewhat of a let down...,"Cinematograpy was excellent, but I found the plot a bit thin, and the acting, whilst of high quality, seemed almost ""workman-like"". Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I usually get more enjoyment from British productions."
4,Great acting,"Set in India, this movie has a heart warming story, gentle humor and an outstanding cast but India steals the show!"
5,A Fantastically Wonderful and Enjoyable Movie!,"I so enjoy Judi Dench and when I saw this advertised on TV I knew I wanted to get it when I became available here on Amazon. It was amazing in all aspects of the film. The choice of actors, the acting, the sites, the premise of the movie were all woven together so beautifully to create a very touching and very real thing that could have happened to anyone who travels in a group. I also enjoyed the part after the movie was over where you can see how the film was created and hear the director's and the actor's comments and more. It's a treasure I will watch again and again."
4,Great flick,When got past viewing issues the film was wonderful. Men would consider a chic flick but very meaningful could visualize this happening.
5,Loved it!,a fun getaway. no intense thinking required as in so many esoteric moview. it is just pure entertainment with a moral.
3,Okay movie.,This movie was good in the way it brought people of different backgrounds together for a common purpose. The set was beautiful.
3,Disappointing,Sad to see the patronizing presentation of the local Indians. Too slapstick for my taste. I expected better from this cast.
5,Enjoyable and funny,One of the best flicks we have watched this year. The whole family liked it. Highly recommended for all audiences.
5,Great Movie,"If you're a senior citizen, about to become one, or just want to watch great actors in an exotic location, you'll enjoy this movie."
4,Very enjoyable little movie,Great locations and explosive color in backgrounds. Enough to make you want to visit India though far away. Great cast of all star talent.
3,As expected.,"Cute, predictable, and single minded in its message. Definitely captures the essence and colors of Inida. Excellent cast, but a fairly forgettable movie."
3,Last Half was Great,"It took a while to get started, but one did get much background information in the beginning. Last half turned into a very heartwarming story."
4,Nice One,I always admire Judi Dench and this one was no exception. It's a comedy about some people who happen to all decide to go to India for different reasons and happen to stay together at a hotel which to their surprise is nothing like what was promised in the brochure. They have interesting adventures adjusting to a new culture and end up falling in love with the country - most of them - in different ways. It's a good comedy for a couple of nice hours. Highly Recommended.
5,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.,"Just a wonderful feel good movie. There is life after 70! The cast is magnificent, but then anything with Judy Dench has got to be great"
5,Boy was I wrong - in a good way,"I thought this would be a chick flick. I only got it because of the caliber of the actors (Dame Judy Dench for one). Boy was I wrong! A number of elderly Brits head to India with different backStories. They end up in a ramshackle hotel with its own story. All the characters adapt with varying degrees of success and outcomes.I thought I would only tolerate the movie. I actually enjoyed the movie, engrossed in the various plots and ended up enjoying the movie. Will definately watch again and again. I am glad I was wrong about the film!"
2,Should Have Been Much Better,"Fabulous cast, intriguing idea, yet a disappointment. First half is stronger but the second half falls into unbelievable bordering on ridiculous. Total waste of a talented, seasoned cast. Fun to see them together, though. I had higher expectations, and they were certainly not met."
2,Faulty copy of a fun movie,"I'd seen the movie several months before purchasing it after it was recommended by a friend. Having recently spent almost five months in southeast Asia the setting left me longing to be back ""on the road""......and back in the color and the chaos that is so much of Asia. The cast is superb, the dialog well written, the story.....though certainly not profound.....is good theater. Sometmes funny, sometimes sad, both simple and complex. My problem....and the reason my rating is so low....is that the disk I received is clearly defective and will be returned as soon as I dig myself out of the snow drifts."
2,The movie was fine; the Amazon service is lacking,"We almost enjoyed the move. However, the Amazon/TIVO delivery did not provide closed captioning.After so many years of improvements in HD movie delivery, you would think Amazon could provide closed captioning for people who need that feature to really enjoy their movies."
2,Cheesy,"The cast looked strong, but the script was weak and the laughs were cheap. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,Not worth it.,Very strange movie - the acting was great but other than that it isn't worth the money. Left me wondering why I spent all that precious time watching it.
3,About what you'd expect.,A feel good movie like a thousand others. Nothing very special here. The plot is straight forward and you'll have the whole movie figured out in the !st 15 min.
5,Delightful Movie,My family and I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.The cast was an outstanding collection of veteran actors and the plot was heartwarming.
4,Charming!,"There are plenty of detailed reviews here, so I will just be brief. This is a feel-good movie with a stellar cast set among the cacophony that is India. I smiled, and laughed through the whole thing and cannot wait to see it again. I urged all my FB friends and more to make the time to see it. As I said in my title- Charming film!"
1,Read the Book,"After recently reading the book, and seeing that a movie had been made from it, I was very excited to see it. What a disappointment!! This movie barely follows the story line of the original, and in fact, appears to be a story from some other book - maybe ""Life in India for Westerners who are old."" Even if I hadn't read the book, I found that the two hours this movie spent to tell the tale was weak and left many ends untied - as one other Amazon reviewer pointed out, ""how they got hooked into going to the hotel was all very fuzzy. Suddenly they are all together on a plane for India"". If I was the author of this book, I'd be rather upset with the guy who wrote the screenplay. What was he thinking?? Terrible."
4,Great Movie,"This is a very good movie particularly for ""baby boomers."" It is a very funny and heartwarming view on aging."
4,Feel good movie for the older set.,"Great cast, if you like British movies and/or TV shows, you'll recognize all these terrific actors. An interesting movie about new beginnings and new possibilities for those in their 60s 70s or more."
4,Love Judy Dench,This is a good movie well worth seeing. All the actors are wonderful so I will keep this one on my shelf.
5,"Saw it in the theatre, had to own it!",Will watch it again and again. I've wanted to share this movie with friends. Now I am able. I'm also reading the novel.
5,My husband loved it as much as I did!,Great story with a dash of funny and yet some real life circumstances. This is an especially good movie for folks just beginning retirement to see how strange some things may become even In what seems everyday life.
4,Good Entertainment,This is a good movie if you are old enough to appreciate it. I would say you would need to be *AT LEAST* 50 years old to truly get it.
4,Great fun!,This movie was fun! I only gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of rather slow moments. All in all this was a great movie with a fabulous cast! I would rent this one again.
5,best movie ever!!!!!!!!,"this movie is not a fast pase movie its like reading a good book. the movie is funny, profound, insightful, and sad. but its one of thoses movies where you see a bit of yourself in each one of the carectures. plus the inda culture you will find vary inturesting. =)"
4,Loved it!,"As an older woman, I had a great appreciation and understanding of this wonderful movie. However, it was recommendedby a good friend who is not even yet 50 so it must appeal to more than just senior citizens."
3,"Wonderful cast, beautifully acted, ok movie","A friend completely raved about this movie when she saw it in the theatre, so I was excited to watch it when it was released on ""video"".I love almost all of the actors in this movie - who wouldn't? They have such pedigree! The cast was something like a ""best-of-Britain"". And they each played their parts beautifully. The cinematography cast a magical air about the story, the scenery was stunning.But even with all of these things in favour of the movie, I found the storyline ultimately very weak which was such a shame. If you choose to watch the movie, enjoy the atmosphere of this movie, but don't expect anything too deep."
5,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"I watched this movie twice in the past two days, and each time it was better than ever. I consider this one of the all-time best movies I have ever purchased from Amazon. Fantastic actors who expressed powerful emotions concerning senior citizens and the ways they faced their loneliness and love. It was a very touching movie, one that I can relate to, and I plan to view it several more times before sharing it with some of my other friends. I look forward to more films in this same genre. Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Dev Patel, Tom Wilkinson, and Bill Nighy are to be commended for outstanding performances."
4,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"I enjoyed this movie, which centers on change and acceptance. Those who can accept change, and those who can’t. The cast is great … each is as unique as the other stars of the show, the hotel and India itself! All provide an interesting contrast of what was versus what is. Well worth the look see."
5,Not For Everyone...But I Loved It,"This show is definitely not one that everyone will find witty or sensible or even life changing, but it's enjoyable and light-hearted which is what a movie ought to be."
4,Adventurous British ex-pat seniors in India. Amusing.,"I was looking forward to watching this based on reviews and the stellar cast. Problem was, although the cast was great, the script was not. The movie has an interesting premise, and lots of potential, but anything out of the ordinary in the story was given superficial treatment. It was light, and almost anything that could have been heavy and dramatic didn't really belong. On the other hand, this was not a hootfest either. It stayed in amusing mode throughout. It's because of the cast and the rarity of a senior cast and theme that doesn't go all tragic that I give it 4 stars. Does everything about older people have to be maudlin? This movie says no."
5,BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL,"Movie had a great cast with great acting. It was colorful, not only in its setting, but so rich in the characters'own personalities and each of their joys and dissapointments. Beautiful!Highly recommended"
4,"Sly, funny British film","You can't go wrong with actors such as Dame Maggie Smith, Dame Judy Dench and Tom Wilkinson. Quirky, funny and controversial characters stranded in a dilapidated hotel that was supposed to be grand place to retire. Their struggles to adjust to a foreign cultural and their own identities is funny and captivating to watch."
3,enjoyed it,"It wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be, but it was well done. Judy Dench is always fabulous."
3,"Good, but could have been magical!","I enjoyed the general movie experience, however, the movie as a whole lacked a somewhat dreamy quality it could have achieved. This locale was vibrant with color, great actors and interesting plot. I just felt it needed more depth, for i truly liked the idea it tried to express to viewers. Agreed, there were some very serious and sombre moments, but others could have built the film quality higher."
5,Retirement Can Be An Adventure,Superb casting and a more than viable script make this a story dear to me and I would think close to the heart of anyone near retirement age. The interpersonal relationships are delicately balanced with strength and insight.
5,Great Movie,This movie was better and more entertaining than most I have seen recently. Watch it love it and remember the sayings.
4,the best exotic marigold hotel,"sweet movie that brings a smile to your face. A nice way to see that life continues, changes, but continues"
3,Movie review,This is the movie that I was looking for and at a great price with prompt service. However I had wanted a DVD rather than VHS. Had not noticed whether it said or not. My bad.
4,Character driven gem of a movie,"I've seen this movie twice and liked it both times. It took us into a world that was completely foreign to the characters, and foreign to the audience as well. It was eye opening to see a slice of Indian life, if only from a movie perspective. Judi Dench and Maggie Smith were great as always. Each character had their own reasons for being there and had a different outlook on their unfamiliar and shocking surroundings. I really didn't like the character of Mrs. Ainsley, but who would. She had great facial expressions though.There was just a little bit about their backgrounds in England, but enough to set the stage for their behavior at the ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"".They talk a lot about how they are old, but they seem very youthful for the most part.I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy watching life in a different land that you may not be familiar with, and those who enjoy character driven films."
4,Fun movie,"I love the ongoing message: Everything will be okay in the end. If it is not okay, it is not the end."
3,Half-baked,"This would have been wonderful had the plot lines been more fully integrated. It was far too contrived. The location was terrific, and the Indian actors were a treat. The cultural themes were intriguing as well. I would watch these English actors read the phone book so I enjoyed it, but it will likely have limited appeal to those not older and dealing with or anticipating dealing with end of life issues. In the end I felt cheated. It should have been a great film instead of just okay."
5,one of the best movies this year,"Fun, fun, fun and very touching too. I don't know how many ""kids"" would appreciate this film....but, if you are of a certain age It's a big winner"
4,A nice drama for a Sunday afternoon,Nothing really fantastic about it but it did have its moments of interesting and smiles. A bunch of older folks decide they want to get away from their problems and build something of a new life. They do indeed find their life changing.
1,Good movie - from what I could watch....,"Amazon for whatver reason over the holidays had TERRIBLE download service - the stars are a reflection of the download, not the movie.From what we did see of the move itself, it was delightful!Now I have to figure out how to get my money back from Amazon - this also happened the day after Christmas when we tried to watch ""The Campaign"".I am happy to report that Amazon IMMEDIATELY refunded my money, and the movie was enjoyed.Overall - I would change my rating to three stars from one."
2,Dull Boring,"I anticipated this movie very much. With all the great actors, I couldn't wait to see it. Turns out I was very disappointed. I found this movie to be very dull and boring. I was hoping it would be funny, which is wasn't. I am surprised so many people loved it and that it got such good reviews."
1,hoped for so much more....,"I rented this thinking it was a a sure fire bet...however, it was very disappointing.No depth to the characters and just boring at times....love Judy but this is the worst things she hasdone in my opinion....not worth the rent."
1,Great movie but Amazon Prime would not allow us to watch it,"The movie was going to be an evening of enjoyment, However the silly thing ran for 5 min and quit. Could not reload it. It just never overcame the fact that it would not reload. Sorry"
1,"seem to go on and on, not too exciting","Was really disappointed as the trailer made it look so good, I wouldn't recommend. I watch alot of movies and this just didn't gel."
5,Thought provoking,Great movie that deals with one of the problems with our aging population. What do we do with the elderly so that they don't burden society or the1r families.
4,Delightful Movie - Boomer,"As a baby boomer it's really great to see more movies with ""senior"" stars and ""senior"" issues. I am contemplating retiring in three years and have considered living outside the US. This movie gave me insight on questions to ask and also let me know its important to involve yourself in the local culture and customs to get the fullest benefit of the experience. I recommended this movie to my 82 year old mother who loved it."
4,Winning Tale of Best Exotic Relationship Rehab Failures,"Exotic location spices up these interesting tales of relationships on the rocks, depression, and self-flagellation. Fortunately for us, the stories are well-told, character development is good and the human spirit can be kind at the core. In the end, kindnesses can be the key that unlocks a door of hope to tomorrow which really can be a new - and better - day. Ultimately uplifting if not truly a salvation story for all."
3,Just So-So,"Pleasant enough but it left me feeling ambivalent about the characters. They were just too cliche to garner much interest in their trials and tribulatiions. And honestly, it's hard to imagine anyone trading their very calm, even boring existance at retirement, age for the chaotic habitat in India unless they were forced to."
5,Great for seniors!!!,"We enjoyed this movie---as I said before ""It is great for the senior group"". Many enjoyable parts for that age group---over 60-65 I feel.Acting was very good and the scenery was enjoyable."
4,Sucker for a Happy Ending!,Sweet movie and I have always been a sucker for a happy ending and it is all here!! A must see!
5,My Kind of Movie,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The characters draw you in to their stories. It is sad & funny and leaves you feeling hopeful.
5,great movie,I heard of it and put it on my want to see list. Glad I did watch it. It was even better than I thought it might be. Far more in depth than I expected.
5,Great Movie,Me and my mom just loved watching this movie unfold. Its a real great story that shows you how we all live in our Western bubble pretty much unaware of what it is like to live in other parts of the world.
5,Great fun!!,"I enjoyed the movie very much. I only watched it because my mother wanted to see it, but I ended up liking it as well."
5,This is now on my favorites list!,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is serious, thought provoking, with that British humor that I so love. I loved this movie and watch it over and over. It is long the line of Tea With Mussolini, Calendar Girls etc. ."
5,Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,Wonderlful movie and to see life does not end when you retire---it begins--new adventures. I know I'm working on my bucket list and enjoying new adventures!!
3,GOOD!,"Actualy I would give to this album 3 and 1/2 stars. I think this is not the best Elton's album from 80'es just because it has rock songs. Too Low For Zero is the best and Leather Jackets is the weakest. Blue Eyes is song which doesn't fit to this album,it is more for Big Picture(perfect album). Blue Eyes is also the best song here. Where Have All The Good Times Gone is perfect song. The worst song is I Am Your Robot. Empty Garden is great song but there is one problem. Listen to his voice on Blue Eyes and then listen to Empty Garden! Elton probably wants that Empty Garden sound like Tiny Dancer! But it's ok! More than solid Elton's album!"
3,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Like 21 at 33 an otherwise lackluster release gets bumped to 3 stars on the strength of two classic tracks, ""Blue Eyes"" and ""Empty Garden."" On the other hand, since those songs are available on Elton collection CDs, maybe this is worth skipping."
5,Very Good,"Blue Eyes, Empty Garden, Ball and Chain, All Quiet On The Western Front, Dear John... Very good songs here. Not Elton John's best, but as good as anything you'd hear on the radio - or should I say MTV - at that time. Certainly better than anything you'd hear now. Interestingly, I don't think many people know that Empty Garden is about the life and sadly - death - of Sir Elton's great friend John Lennon. Apparently Johnny used to love gardening, and would spend hours tending his crops. I love the line ""It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain."" Taken literally about the assasination of John Lennon. ""Can you come out to play - IN YOUR EMPTY GARDEN."" Good work Bernie. Beautiful tune Elton. Terrific or should I say Fantastic Tribute."
5,One of his best!,"You typically hear more about Elton's hits from the early seventies, but some of his best work came from the '80s, and it's clear that he was having a lot of fun with this one. I still enjoy it now as much as ever.Amazon.com is the place to go if you're having trouble finding things, and I was pleased with the time it took to get it."
2,An OK album.,Certainly not one of his best. I am a big Elton fan and I got this to fill out my collection and not because it was a quality work.
3,About tops for Elton in the '80s.,"This is actually my second favorite 1980's Elton album, only to be outdone on '83's ""Too Low for Zero."" There is a good selection of strong material like ""Ball & Chain,"" ""Empty Garden,"" ""Dear John"" and especially closer ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" Elton will never again duplicate his early '70's successes, but if you want to hear him in the '80's this is a good place to start."
1,"Great if you live in Los Angeles, otherwise don't bother!","I was very disappointed in this book.If you live in Los Angeles, I would recommend this book, otherwise forget it. Many of the most unusual jobs were related to the movie and television industry and thus only available in LA, or perhaps New York. Others you could probably only find if you lived in a very (and I do mean very) large city. As for the rest of the jobs, the majority of them can be seen in the want ad columns everyday.Almost all of her source information recommended checking in the yellow pages under the desired field. When there were actual phone numbers again they were usually for Los Angeles or other large cities.While there were a few ideas I found interesting I think this book would have been better titled: '50 run of the mills jobs that you've already seen in the want ads, 24 interesting ideas, 20 more interesting ideas if you live in a very large city, and 60 really cool ideas if you happen to live in Los Angeles.'"
4,Interesting and informative,"It's definitely a must read book for people who would like to build a ""portfolio career"". If you are not for the 9-5 office culture and you'd rather do a more interesting and unconventional job.This book will guide you through a series of weird, fun and unusual jobs. As the titled reveals, they will probably be only for survival, so forget the big bucks if you want to work as a personal shopper, a focus group participant or a food demonstrator.A good and well written reference book. Keep in mind that it would be easier to get those jobs if you live in a big city.By Thei Zervaki, a career and business coach"
4,All You've Ever Wanted to Know about Sorority Pledging,"If you've ever wondered what it's really like to pledge a sorority, read Walking the Line. This book provides explicit details on pledging, hazing, initiation and rejection as well as the aftermath of it all. You'll get the inside story of walking the [pledging] line as well as other lines that the main characters are forced to walk.We all have lines to walk in our lives. I enjoyed the way the author chose the sorority-pledging process to demonstrate how the main character walked that particular path. In sum, Walking the Line is an insightful, light, quick, enjoyable read."
5,I'm Addicted,"This story is a must read whether you are Greek, Non-Greek, College bound or a dropout. Ms. Hughes has successfully captured the essence of college life. That essence boils down to one thing: CHOICES. Anyone who has lived can relate to and learn from this novel. It teaches the female about determination and not exepting less than your worth. It shows the male how to be a male. It also purports that its cool to not conform.What set this novel apart from others in the genre was the ""writing within the writing"". Ms. Hughes was able to pull this off as if there were actually two authors on this one book."
2,"All Flash, No Substance","This book has several very attractive pictures of very flexible people performing asanas. If you like to go to local yoga classes to watch others practice, then this is the book for you. This book is very impractical for most readers though. There is a lot of ground covered, and none of it is done with any degree of thoroughness. This book gets points only for presentation. Check out the book by Erich Schiffman for a complete yoga book you can use."
2,A good fairy tale,"If you are Mormon, this gives you all you must know about your presidents: the most clean and neat persons in this world. If you aren't Mormon, read it as a fairy tale, because what people need to know is not here."
3,Just OK,I am used to Bertrice Smalls books and this didn't have much passion for being the passionate one. This whole series was a little disappointing. The characters were good but it seemed there could have been so much more. It wasn't bad and I am glad I read all three. It looks like people enjoyed it better than I did.
2,gothic suprize,"I love lush, romantic stories. The reviews, description, etc., on the cover convinced me that this book would be all of the above. Lo and behold, instead of romance, I entered a gothic, murky world of unpleasant, depressing characters. Yes, the author is good at storytelling, but the 2 star rating reflects what I believe was deceptive advertising. Too much torment, too much deep agony for my tastes. Buyer beware!"
5,Outstanding Characters!,"Ash was truly a troubled yet fascinating man and he loved Rhiannan, no doubt about it. CB did an outstanding job with this guy emotionally. It's a bit rare to find such a depthful hero. Well done!Although we didn't get to meet his brother Raine, I felt like I knew him. (I'm sure he has his own story).I disliked their father, which was the author's intent, so bravo on that. The guy was reprehensible. As for their sister, Fia, she was a puzzle. She was kind of nice, then cold and seemingly evil-minded. Never could decide if I liked her or not."
4,Very Intense Hero,I found this book very enjoyable. The author doesn't write as though she is talking to children. Ash was just a touch too moody for me but still quite likable. I will definitely read the sequels.
5,Dark and Dangerous Trip to McClairen's Isle,"Ash Merrick is a strong and tormented hero. Rhiannon is a heroine who fights for herself. When the two meet, it's instant combustion! This book went on my keeper shelf; with it's outstanding leads, wonderful locales, one can only look forward to the next two books. Definitely for the reader that likes a deep and thoughtful read."
1,piece of junk,"this product is an absolute rip off. it gives completely different readings even for a stationary object, much less a wiggling baby! we bought this to keep up with our baby's growth and compare her weight to the pediatricians recommendations. Needless to say, the scale was of no help, and only made us overly worried about the wildly varying readings.. we would never recommend this product to any of our friends or family. i hope this product is discontinued, as it is only a wasteful addition of plastic to the environment."
2,Shoot the sound engineer,"I always thought of Marshall as being way ahead of its time. What a wonderful blend of Southern Fried Rock, jazz and blues. Taking a hint from Jethro Tull and adding the flute gave them their distinct sound.--- It is painful to listen to the audio on this disc. Who did this? Katel? Sounds like it was remastered using two tin cans and a string! I have a great sound system, but not even that could make this disc sound good. If I was the engineer that remastered this concert, I would not put my name in the credits. I gave the disc two stars due to the historical value of the event.If there is any other footage of the original lineup out there, lets hope it will be handled with the reverence it deserves."
5,fantastic,"i was really pleased with this dvd for as old as it is i thought there would be alot more flaws Thanks and i will definitely be ordering alot more good ol' southern rock cos' like they always say "" they ain't malin' music like this anymore!-YEE HAA """
5,"A question, not a review","I am trying to remember all the concerts I have ever been to and I know that I went to see Marshall Tucker and Orleans opened for them at the Providence Civic Center. I think it was the winter (not sure) but can't remember what year. I have tried looking for archival files for either Marshall Tucker, Orleans and Providence Civic Center but with no luck. Anyone remember that concert and if so, what year (and month). Thanks."
3,Good Concert,"Not my favorite concert DVD, but it's not bad either. The camera work wasn't the greatest (especially when the camera would zoom in elsewhere when Caldwell would be doing some great solo), but if you're a MTB fan, as myself, get it."
2,Poorly Produced,"First off, I want to say the Band sounds good and could still play well. However, the production value of the DVD is atrocious. It seems they had no idea as to the arrangement of the songs as indicated by the camera cuts. The sound is poor. It feels as if a few mics were placed near the PA, which is a poorly conceived idea. This was an MTV production in their early years. I don't think they had a clue! Its too bad because it would be nice to have a visual documentation of a terrific band who could still deliver these great songs live! I was very disappointed."
3,For diehard fans it'll do,Okay dvd for the diehard fan. Looks like something your brother-in-law put together at times. Very disappointed in the editing. My 12 yr.old does better work with home movies. Close-ups of band members playing backup while the lead guitarist is wailing away is frustrating to say the least. Sound quality comes and goes. Just very uneven production overall and will not bring many into the fold who don't already have a warm spot for the band.
5,Magical Nite/Magical CD!,"I was there and it was a magical nite & as it drew to a close we could see snow falling softly outside the chapel at The Grotto. The music was so wonderful that we didn't even think...""boy the streets are going to be murder driving home!""Michael is joined with several of his musician friends to weave a holiday spell you won't soon forget. I wish there were more selections for you to hear; but, trust me on this one: you'll be glad you ordered this CD."
5,Makita 6019DWE 7.2- Volt,"I recommend this Makita Drill Driver to anyone who is looking for a cordless drill, I've been doing construction work for over 20 years and always use Makita Tools, I had a cordless drill that I purchased back in 1995 and used it constantly, then it died and I needed a replacement so I went to the stores and all I could find were these big bulky 18 volt cordless drills,so I decided check amazon.com and found exactly what I was looking for,I love this cordless drill even came with extra batterys. Who would want to buy a bulky 18 volt cordless drill when you could buy a compact 7.2 volt cordless drill which has just as much power and half the weight."
4,Right size Houshold Drill/Driver,"I was looking for a drill/driver for small around the house jobs and (without the bulk of most other drills) for getting into smaller places. This item seemed to be the right choice. Haven't had a chance to use it much, but so far I believe that I am going to be very satisfied with this purchase. Shopped online very extensively before deciding on this one. I'm hoping the battery life will be better than the last non-Makita drill I had."
2,Almost worthless,"Besides Blum, this is one of the most worthlees sets out there. Svenson ignores the true meanings of the runes and set coures into Neverland. If you want a good set of runes, this set doesn't have one. The terra cotta colored rune set is not practical for rune casting because of the fragility of the material. Find a good dealer of rune sets and purchase one that is more substantial; or, better yet, make your own and purchase a better book like Northern Mysteries and Magic by Freya Aswynn or Runelore by Edred Thorson."
4,hmmm...,"You bought a set of runes and have not one clue what to do with them? This book will guide you through the history of the rune, different readings you may do with them, along with an explaination of each rune (along side it's picture for those who are just beginning). This wonderful small book is excellent for beginners. Only set back is that the history might confuse you a small bit."
5,Excellent saw!,"I was looking for a 71/4"" circular saw that my 2000 watt generator could power with ease. There's a few that draw 13 amps, but I was pleasantly supprised to find a Makita with a 10.5 amp rating. This saw is a true gem. It has plenty of power, runs quiet and due to it's light weight but very sturdy design and balance is a pleasure to use. It's precision foot plate and adjustment features are top notch. Makita is one of the few companies left that knows how to build a quality tool offered at a very reasonable price without sacrificing a thing."
3,Makita 5740 7-1/4 saw,"A nice light saw, much easier to use overhead or cutting siding ion the wall. Adjustment is primitive- but light. Blade guard hangs up a bit. The first time I dropped it, the plate came out of line with the blade, and the second time, the blade guard cracked front and rear where the plate mounts. I might buy another because the mag is clunky, but the price is high. 5007nk is a better buy"
4,Good for money,"This violin arrived as advertised online. The case is not as nice as some I have seen and does not have the backpack straps but does have ""legs"" on side that enable one to sit the case on the floor without the actual case touching the floor. A single strap is included. Finish is nice and sounds good once tuned. For a student violin, we are very happy with this product. This is after returning several lesser made violins from another website. This exact violin was selling in our local music store for $40 more. Worth buying."
1,Not a very good instrument,"I bought this a couple of years ago not knowing anything about violins. The finger board is slanted toward the violin (not normal according to my teacher who plays professionally), the strings are very close together it doesn't even compare to my teacher's violin with string spacing, the A string will not stay in tune to play an entire song. It is now a toy for the kids to play with."
1,Very Amateurish Documentary,"This is a short documentary which contains very little information about Snowies and is very amateur in its filmmaking - both audio and video. It is out of focus, has bad sound and contains very few scenes of Snowies - none of which are closeup. It appears that neither of the two main filmmakers have any experience making documentaries or DVD's. I wish I had known all this before I bought it. Do not waste your money buying this DVD."
5,San Diego street map looks good!,I like this laminated map. At first I was confused because it's sideways but then it does give you the North east west compass directions. I guess they made it like that because you can fit more into the map.I like the flip side of the map that shows you a larger area. I'll be staying at the travelodge at palm avenue by the mexican border and I can see how to get to the heart of San diego. It show you the tourist spots and the business district and the various beaches and the airport. It also shows you the trolley lines which I'll be using. Really nice concise map.
4,handy little map,"handy little map to have, like how it gives overall view as well as neighborhood views. Sure I will use it in future trips."
2,Very Lacking,This map arrived today and when I opened it I wondered where the REST of the map was. San Diego is a huge city and this map shows only the tiniest portion of it. Details are difficult to see. If you need to go beyond the east side of Balboa Park you are out of luck.
5,glorious !,"I first heard this in Japan on CD and was smitten by the music, performance and sheer quality of all three, or should I say four... because four of the best are here on this album, Duke Ellington, Joe Pass, Ray Brown and Louie Bellson. The first track, 'Cotton Tail' did it for me, I was hooked and you will be too. If you like music and appreciate music making of the highest order, this is for you. It's obvious these guys are having a great time, but if you want to move up a gear, check out this version on XRCD. Not only do you get the feel of the original release, original artwork, beautiful presentation and nice touches like the protective disc sleeve inside, you get the best audio quality to boot. If anybody out there thinks CD is on the way out, listen to this and enjoy the satisfied grin you will wear. If only I could have heard this live, never mind at least i have this in my collection now.....glorious."
3,"not bad, but not great, either","This book isn't one of my favorite Love Stories books, but it's all right. Miguel is very prejudiced, and personally I don't think Leanna should go with someone like him. He has only one view of Leanna and that is that she's Philipino."
1,"Betty Crocker Bowl, Appetit","I was quite disappointed with the rice/veggie bowl mix.Very dull, rather tasteless. I don't know that I willuse up the remaining 11 ""dishes"". I may donate them toa food kitchen.D. Heliotis"
5,a very useful book to keep,"I've looked at a ton of books during my pregnancy, and of all of them, the two most useful, helpful ones so far are What to Expect When You're Expecting and this book, Raise A Smarter Child by Kindergarten. I think that I will return to this book again and again. In chapter 3 alone, there are over 30 activities to do with your child, with clear explanation of what to do as well as how it helps your child. The author's narrative throughout the book is not preachy and he acknowledges his own bias, but presents clear, factual support. This was definitely not money wasted (especially since at the bookstores you pay retail!)."
5,Valuable Information for Parents,"Raise a Smarter Child by Kindergarten is perhaps the most comprehensive book I've ever seen relating to enhancing our children's intelligence and paving the way for their future success. Dr. Perlmutter, a neurologist, not only provides the activities, lifestyle recommendations anf nutritional information to build a better brain, but he goes so far as to claim that as many as 30 IQ points are up for grabs and provides the hard core science to back it up. He shows us not only how to treat ADHD without medication, but more importantly, how we can easily prevent it in the first place. His unique schedule for immunizations is especially helpful. This is very important read for all parents and future parents."
5,Excellent Reference for parents of kids Kindergarten and Under,"I am still reading this book and have been intrigued with the level of research, resources and information included in the text. It's written in a way that will educate and motivate parents or caregivers to take an active part in their children's development. Even though it's written by a neurologist, it's not overwhelming to interpret. It's a MUST read for parents; an excellent resource for parents of kids ages 0-Kindergarten."
5,Great Ideas,"This book gave me some great ideas for how to make the best out of the time I spend with my 2 small children. It reminded me that you don't need a lot of fancy equipment or toys. Some notecards, items around the house, and an imagination is really all you need to help your children thrive. Very informative!"
3,"A decent, short survey of world alphabets.","The book is fairly short and does not go into extensive detail on each script; but it is complete, in that it covers all major scripts and alphabets with full transliterations of all letters. Overall, well worth its price."
5,Fabulous book for writing samples,"Mr. Nakanishi has done a superlative job of gathering native print samples from a vast array of different languages. For many languages he shows actual print samples, typically from a newspaper printed in that language. There are comparisons of languages and groupings into language families. For many languages he lists the ""alphabet"" (or syllabary or what have you for the given language) and includes a phonetic transcription of the individual characters.On the inside cover of the hard cover edition, there is a color map showing which scripts are predominantly used in different places around the Earth. The same map is in black and white in the back pages of the paperback edition.If you are looking for a book that shows you how characters look in many different languages, then this is the book for you. For just linguistic curiosity, it's a fascinating book, and extraordinarily helpful as a language/print reference source."
5,Excellent book,"This book has facsimmiles of newspapers in the text The entire alphabet of selected scripts including Japanese, Tibetan, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Armenian, Russian Cyrillic, and many others with a phonetic equivelant to each of letters for each of the language script text. It also lists languages like Chinese and all world nations and the languages that newspapers are printed in there. I highly reccomend this book for all scholars of linguistics."
1,Russian script??? What is that?,How could the Slavic script be called Russian? That's pathetically ignorant. Shame on the author!
4,Outlaw Anthems,"Blood For Blood-Outlaw Anthems ****1/2Coming on loud, angry, and scary, Outlaw Anthems is to date, Blood For Bloods strongest albums, and most concistent. Whitetrash Rob is sick of the current state of the world and how things are. From child abuse in 'Mother Dear' to love in 'So Common So Cheap.' From the subject of class 'White Trash Anthem' Friendship in 'Love Song' to your own personal life in 'Dead End Street' have managed to make an angry album to cover every situation when you could possibly feel this way.If hardcore punk is what your into then Blood For Blood is the band for you, and it you ever get really pissed, then Outlaw Anthems is the album for you. Sorry this review isn't more indebth but this is really a selfexplanitory album that must be heard to understand."
1,White Trash Whining Society Has Done ME Wrong CD,"The only thing I can say about this album is P-U. It has some strong texture and some good break downs, but in almost every song it has to be interupted by White Trash Rob whining about how he has had it rough. I can understand where he is coming from, but to introduce and or talk in every song about it leaves you annoyed. Enough already. Count how many times he says white trash or society, I lost count. Sigh.... Pass this one by. Victory is getting sloppy with its latest realeases. Put out some decent material, should have held onto Hatebreed."
1,Not Good Music,"You can't even call this music. This CD is terrible. One of the songs has the lyric ""F**king your pu**y was like f**king a shotgun wound...with gangrene."" You can't call this music. The guitar sounds like someone bashing on a wall with a cat, and the drums sound like they are being played by an autistic kid on crack. These people have no musical talent, and they need to realize that right now. Go burn your money, because it would be less of a waste than to spend it on this utterly terrible CD."
5,Subfile Review,"I used Phil Levinson's book after graduating with an As/400 degree. The subfile book is essential, and unique. It is the only on of it's kind to go into such detail about subfiles. The examples are easy to understand. The entire book and exercises takes you step by step so you can follow and learn. I would recomend this book to anyone who is new at using subfiles."
3,"not the best, save your money .........box set?","the music is odd.....rubber bullets? donna gave me a head ache.the next album was a bit better.....are these guys still alive? it,s great to find them remastered.the extra tracks slow down the album with the exception of waterfall. let,s only hope eric stewart puts together a box set in the future.graham goldman had a song called ''monkey squeezen's'' that i heard was never released."
3,Portrait of the jazzman as a dying drunk/junky/crackbrained,"Fine writing by Dyer, sometimes really inspired (parts of Chet, Webster, Pepper), at moments a little flat (the Duke-Carney interludes), but... how mighty bleak ! If one has never heard jazz and reads this book, one might think jazz is funeral music, improvisations on agony. Where's the joy, the jubilance, the humor (even Monk seems somewhat humorless under Dyer's eye), the pride, the fierce creativity ? The swing ?! OK, there is some of all that, but few and far between the ultimate boozing bouts (Prez & Webster), head & teeth smashing (Powell and Baker), dementia (Monk, Powell, Mingus), drugs & prison (Baker, Pepper). That said, quite interesting afterword and critical take on innovation in jazz."
4,Just sheer jazz feedback to keep the fire going,"If you ever loved a jazz tune, you will love these pages. Not for anything else but for beauty in the art itself. Sobering, BUT BEAUTIFUL."
3,Good for the interested reader,"As a long time jazz fan, I have read many works. This was disappointing, and did not live up to the accolades laid upon it. The jazz enthusiast will enjoy the anecdotes; but others will find better works."
1,product is no good.,I bought this DVD and it does not have any sound to the DVD. Correct me if I'm wrong but DVD's are supposed to have visual AND AUDIO components to them!!! Very unhappy with this purchase. These items should be recalled!!!
2,A very unreal portrait of urban life,"i really can't believe that the sexual abuse you watch in this movie can actually happened in the real urban life ... she actually seems very permissive and condoning , accepting and encouraging this male abusiness and even appeared to enjoy it !"
5,Best book for Medical Pharmacology,"This book by far is the BEST pharm book out there for medical students. The book is easy to read and helps reinforce important concepts with ALOT of graphs and cartoons. I have this book, Katzung's Board&Review Pharm, and Lippincott's Pharm, and I feel like this book is the best for course work. It's overkill for board study, so I'll be using Katzung for that. Lippincott's is by far the worst, as there are TONS of mistakes in the book. So if you are a medical student looking for a great book for your pharmacology COURSE (again, not for board study), you cannot go wrong with this book."
4,Good but not quite what I needed,"I have this book for an undergrad intro to pharmacology paper, as advised by lecturers. It is also the set text for next year. This is a very good reference book, however I think for my purposes, it is a bit too advanced. It's organised very clearly, and I found it quite useful for writing an essay. But I think to get the best use out of it, the reader should be at a more advanced level of study, or someone like a graduated professional using it as a reference. Overall, I think it is concise and easy to read, with a broad range of types and uses of grugs. Each chapter is set out under the same format: therapeutic overview, mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, relation of mechanisms to clinical response, side effects & problems & toxicity. I'm not very familiar with other pharmac texts, but this was recommended as the text for further study as well. I have a friend at 2nd year med school, and she found it ""good but a bit dry to read""."
5,excellent,"Bought this one for pharmacology as the primary text. If you want the specifics, they are in this book. Successfully incorparates the physiology involved with pharmacology."
5,No Complaints here,Fast and easy transaction. Nothing went wrong- no reason to not give a perfect rating. (Even the material in the book is very helpful and easy to understand.)
5,Amazing,"In my high school we can take a piano class as an elective, and the book that we use is this one. The teacher doesn't have to do anything because the books teaches us so well, in the past 4 weeks I have played through 1/4 of the book and love all the songs that I have played. I would definitely recommenced this book to beginners."
4,Basic Piano,Explained very well in a step by step format for beginners. Great to start by learning to play the piano and read music.
5,Fantastic companion,"As I am a first time piano player, this book has been invaluable. The book has taught me how easy it is to learn key placement and read music. I highly recommend this book for first timers."
5,Daughter's Piano Class,The book was purchased for my daughter's piano course at school. She enjoys the class and the book is really easy to follow.
1,"Boring, boring, boring","I started learning the piano at the age of 43 - from scratch. My goal has been to learn classical music. My teacher recommended this book but I'm afraid I didn't get very far because the music was so unsatisfactory - simplified, shortened and unattractive. I now use the John Thompson adult beginner course and also play pieces from the Suzuki method repertoire, which is lovely when you get to Book two - unabridged (although edited) pieces by Bach, Schumann etc."
5,The Best Teacher,"Alfred's Level One Book was just the ticket! It is far and away thebest beginner's book because it doesn't frustrate the beginner byleaping forward too quickly. It is visually helpful along with takingit slowly but purposely, and it is subtle in adding new things. Thennext thing you know, you are on your way to playing piano! I can't waitto purchase Alfred's Level two and three when finished with this book."
4,Same book with two titles,"I have just received (a) Alfred's basic adult course,Adult all in one-course, level 1 and (b) Alfred's Basic Adult piano course level one and the contents are exactly the same. So don't be fooled by the different titles and arrangement of authors. From the looks of it, I am sure I will find it useful, however, two of the same is of no help."
5,Alfred's Basic Adult Piano Course,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn to play the piano. It takes you thru each signature, teaches chords and is my main book, especially when I am trying to practice the harder ones, I go back to this one to warm up and refresh!"
4,Good for beginners,My piano teacher recommended me this book and I found it very good as a beginner. In my opinion this book is good for beginners.
1,Childish,"I'm almost 60, and tell folks I've had 3 years of piano--first year, three times. So now, with the help, of a modern keyboard I figured I'd try again.But this book took me right back to the dark room, the cranky teacher, and the torture of learning piano. I've thrown it away.Making great progress, though, with Cannel and Marx's ""How To Play The Piano Despite Years of Lessons."""
1,Blargh. Buy this if you want to hate piano lessons...again.,"I agree with the reviewer who said this book is childish. The song selections chosen are grotesque. You really think anybody is going to be impressed with a simplified one-chord-at-a-time version of Scarborough Fair? This book reminded me of why I hated piano lessons in the first place. They assume they know what kind of music I want to learn to play and only teach me enough skills so that I can muster up a lackluster rendition of some stodgy old ""favourite"". My old piano teacher made me buy this book; I hated it as much as I hated her rapping me on the knuckles. It took years to get over her - and this book - to get to a place where I wanted to learn to play.Get a book that's a little more inspired, or at least doesn't talk to you like you're an unmusical idiot."
3,good intro but boring,"this course is good for beginners it is quite step by step. however, the songs are quite unattractive for repetitive practing. I am looking for other lesson of this level now."
3,CD Not Shipped With Book. Buyer Beware,"I bought this book with a lot of excitement and was surprised when I saw that the CD was not shipped with the book. I don't know how I am supposed to purchase the CD or download the audio files. It's a little frustrating.I have not judged the quality of the book.Other buyers, please be aware that the book does not ship with the companion audio CD."
4,Music Books,The first book ordered did not arrive. After waiting the appropriate time I contacted the seller and they resent the item. They guaranteed the shipment which was very nice.
3,too slow,I paid for express delivery and it still came one week later. Don't ever ever pay for exprss delivery through Amazon! Unless its under the individual companies themselves.
3,Kindle version.. had promise,"I have already learned and loved the book version of this but lent it out and never got back. So thought I would buy the Kindle version and then get to at least review. Well I was delighted when I saw that there appeared to be ""Sound Clips"" in the book!That is a great addition! I can compare my playing to what it is Suppose to be.. smile. Well there are the little numbered icons for each song and I can not figure out how to get them to play.So if anyone can assist me that would be great. I have the little $114 kindle that plays music as well.. I have turned on the play music component and I get the stream of my files instead of the sound icons on the page.I dont know what anyone is saying about this only cord version for the left hand.. I have been looking at the notes. I still haven't memorized the cords."
4,Alfred's Basic Adult Piano Course,"I found this exact same book at a local music lessons business but it was $5.00 more than Amazon charges. The book is supposed to come with a CD that is used as part of the lesson plan. The book from Amazon does not contain that CD. So, for the extra $5.00 I would have bought the book locally if I had known that I wouldn't be getting the CD. This is really the first time I've bought something from Amazon that I am really unhappy with. Live and learn I suppose."
3,Not as good as Alfred's Basic (Non-Adult) Course,"I have used Alfred's Basic (non-adult) Piano Course for years with my students with great success. When I began to teach an older beginner, I thought I'd try the adult course. I am not as pleased with it. The adult course focuses mostly on chords in the left hand, so one does not learn to read the independent notes as readily in the left hand. The left hand does not get the strength and independence that the right hand does because of this emphasis on chords. Therefor I will be switching back to the regular Alfred Basic (non-Adult) course."
3,Buy Alfred's All In One book if you're a beginner,"This book and Alfred's All In One, Level 1 book are almost identical. The songs are the same, the material similar. I'd recommend the All In One book if you're a beginner and want lots of reinforcement of the material. This book has the CD, which the Kindle & Plastic bound books do not.In this book there are more words used to present new material, but I found it unhelpful. All In One explains it more succinctly and then seems to fill the space with quizzes that this book has filled with words. This book is for someone who will move through the material quicker and who doesn't like or need a quiz on the material."
5,Great for Self-Teaching,"This book is fantastic for teaching yourself piano, especially if you have a little musical knowledge (from lessons as a child or from playing another instrument). This book is well structured and very easy to work through."
5,"Love, love, love Mary Kay",I absolutely love this shade in the lipstick. I am so happy that MK made it a permanent line instead of a ltd edition as it started out! Very fast service from seller too!
5,A must have book!,"Diction for Singers is a great book, it has helped my singing tremendously! It gives detailed information about a variety of languages and their pronunciation! I recommend this book for any singer!"
2,Never received book,"I ordered the book and was advised that I would receive in about 3 weeks. About a week and a half later, received email that the order was cancelled."
4,Diction for Singers,This is an excellent reference for diction for the six european languages which it covers. For full coverage of the subject there is a referenced volume of International Phonetic Alphabet drills and exercises.
1,disappointment,"i never received my purchase. I had ordered the book for a class and needed it as soon as possible. Since the book never came in, i had to buy it again from other site. I paid DOUBLE for the book."
5,Inspiring Book,I have recommended this book to all the Witch message boards I visit. This is one of the most beautifully illustrated books I have ever seen. I also find the content to be comprehensive and varied. This book touches on a bit of everything. it would be a great book to give to your favorite witch for a Yule present! In fact I am here now buying a second copy for a friend!
4,Life Magic,"This book is very interesting, a great starter book for anyone interested in witchcraft. I would reccomend it."
1,Rubbish,"The author suggests that any music not a ""hymn"" is of satan. He wants the reader to believe that only ""hymns"" are acceptable and in part because hymns allow the congretation to focus on harmony and not the melody of such arrangements as Give Thanks.Read it and tossed in the trash."
2,A Bit Much,"I agree with alot of the points as far as the services being more reverent and respectful,but the idea of the presence of drums and electric guitars being almost considered evil in themselves is a bit much.I think that if their use in worship makes one feel sensual and carnal in any way, the problem lies within that persons spirit not the use of any type of instrument.I would also like to say that if one based praise and worship totally on the principles in this book,you would effectively wipe out 100 years of a wonderful African-American gospel music tradition in this country. There are many scriptures that refer to loud instruments being played to worship God,the stringed instrument and the drum among them.I love the Hymns and I love Gospel and Southern Gospel,but I also love blues and rock,most of all I love My Lord And Saviour Jesus Christ. Jesus will help you discern what is appropriate and what is not, look to the Cross."
1,Well.....,"--Sorry folks, I disagree.I just finished ""The Word of God in English"", by Leland Ryken, which details the differences in biblical translational theories and is painstakingly researched and bibliographed and extremely well written.Dan Lucarini's book ABSOLUTELY PALES in comparison to this book. Dan uses non-sequetur arguments, proof texting, portrays his opinion as established fact, is eisegetical, and overall quite disappointing.As a classically trained church musician (whose opinions Dan seems to value above unschooled fishermen) I disagree with almost every conclusion."
1,Theology and logic out the window,"A realistic look at contemporary worship music might have been helpful. This book is merely preaching to the choir... those mad about changing musical styles and tastes within the church. Many praise songs are right out of the Psalms which destroys the argument of superior theology in the hymns. The argument that a back beat is wrong sounds racist to me. So Lucarini is saying the only style that's acceptable is music from our European ancestors... and the black Christian church is not spirit filled and unable to discern proper musical style... Give me a break! Every statement in the book has some grain of truth to it but no more than one small grain per statement. This book embarasses the church. If your Christian faith is locked into the 1850-1950 time period, buy the book. If you want to be 'in the world but not of it', look elsewhere."
4,Black Metal 290 Degree Wide Angle Peephole Door Viewer Scope,Awesome wide angle. Easy to install and quick delivery. I would recommend this product again and again.
5,Love it!,"What a gem! Low in price...high in function and ease! This took me about 15 minutes in total time to put in...which includes getting out the drill and putting it away! Once the hole is drilled, it took about 2 minutes to install! I am very pleased with this and recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing a peephole. It is also 290 degree view. My steps are at a 90 degree angle from my door and I can see them!"
5,Better than 5 Stars!!!,This door scope it is the most AMAZING I had ever owned. I had also checked out similar products installed in the hotel rooms that I have visited.I am speechless... EXCELLENT quality of the materials and craftsmanship. The advertised VIEW of 290 degree is at least that if not better. You can literally see the outside door knob from the inside of your room.
4,Puro Latin Bass!,"mostly produced by Mr Mixx (2 Live Crew), ""Bass Balla"" features some great Latin-tinged bass tracks, especially ""Mariachi Twist"", ""Olé Olé"" and of course ""Ku Ku"" (based on a track by la sonora dinamita). However, the other tracks aren't THAT cool, ""Sancho Villa"", ""Jonny Z"" as well as ""Z1 N only"" are better and more versatile; and the all-spanish version of ""Bass Balla"", ""El Catrín"", features all of the good tracks off of ""Bass Balla"" plus some songs not featured on ""Bass Balla"" - en español, naturalmente, with the exception of ""Ku Ku"" which is featured in both spanish and english on ""Catrín""."
4,Uncomfortable and unpleasant,"Creepy, weird, disorderly, jarring, spiky: Join Hands is difficult to listen to and utterly fantastic. The tracks sound splintered, like parodies of what we think of as a ""song,"" and yet at the same time are strangely appealing and tuneful. This internal contradiction seemed to fuel a lot of the Banshees' work, and Join Hands embodies it over the course of the album, essentially falling apart as the tracks progress, with songs like ""Oh Mein Papa"" and ""The Lord's Prayer"" disintegrating the idea of ""music"" entirely. And yet, like all the other Banshees' work, it's also quite enjoyable. This really is a work of art, very smart stuff."
3,Not My Favorite...,"Join Hands is my least favorite album by Siouxsie & The Banshees but with that aside, the remastering sounds amazing! Alas, the one unreleased track on here isn't that great but the original album sounds crisper than ever & worthy of listening to again."
2,Slippin,I was very disappointed when i received this i was hoping the song Slippin' was explicit but it's not it's another clean version the same as the album version
1,"I'm sorry, Dave!","Dave warned me it was bad. He said not to watch it, but I did anyway -- and it was painful. Here's the gist:A black guy and a white guy are buddies. Their families get along reasonably well with each other to the extent that they can make minor racial jabs. That's it.The bad part is that the writing is horrible. The jokes are cliched. The characters are one-dimensional. The laugh track is way overdone -- simple puns are responded to with riotous laughter.I watched the first two episodes before turning it off. I might watch the last one to see if it improved."
1,Pilates Exercises for Osteoporosis,"The quality of the tape is poor. The voice of the instructor is monotonous and at times speaks like she is not sure of what she is about to say, like it is hard to get her thoughts in order. I could not watch the whole tape due to the tape quality and the instructor does not provide motivation. It seems like it was a home made tape, due to the quality and setting."
3,Colace stool softener for ear wax removal,"Thought I was ordering a 30ml. bottle of the real thing, but company sent a 16oz. bottle of a substitute without notifying me of any changes. The stuff seems to work the same, but I now have enough to last me a lifetime-that is until the expiration date arrives and I have to dump about 99.5% of the stuff down the crapper. Caveat emptor."
3,A very uneven album,"I normally like Tinsley Ellis' albums, but this one is the exception. It doesn't really hold together with any cohesion, and was evidently the result of (at least)two different sessions. The ones with the basic band of Bob McNeely (guitars) Scott Koziol(bass and Tad Parker (drums)[tracks 1,2,6,9 and 10] are tight and show off Ellis' guitar playing. I'd guess that this was his road band at the time; it certainly sounds like it. Producer Tom Dowd evidently wanted more tracks and variation, so the other tracks have a different band ( Duck Dunn on bass) with the augmentation of Kevin McKendree (keyboards) on some tracks.Best track from this session is Magic Sam's ""Look what you done"", but on the album as a whole pick are ""Diggin'my own grave"" and ""One sunny day"". If you're new to Tinsley Ellis buy another album first."
5,Calm Tea,"The tea was exactly what I ordered, and arrived fresh and in good shape.I thought I would be saving money via a combined tea shipping order, but it came separate, so it turned out the shipping was as expensive as the one box of tea--that's not the seller's fault-it was mine, not understanding that Amazon would do it that way."
3,Lacks subtlety--an average herbal tea.,"I love the description of this tea--egyptian chamomile and moroccan rose blossoms--I wish I could taste or smell either of these flavors!! This tea mainly tastes like mint and hibiscus--neither of which is particularly soothing in my book. As compared to the wonderfully complex African Red Bush or the dazzlingly subtle Lotus, this one is not in the same league!! A middle of the road herbal tea."
2,Save your money,Save your money. Poorly written and devoid of any meaningful information. This is not a reference for collectors.
2,Buy the Ibanez book instead.,"Nothing to add to the existing reviews. I was hoping it would be like the excellent Ibanez- The untold story. That book is $40.00 and only available at this time from Ibanez, but it's well worth it. Covers a lot more of the 70's-80's history ."
2,Disappointed,"I have had this program for a while. Entering the recipes is not a problem but saving them into another format to email...well that is a problem. And, I would print out my recipes and it would say 1 cup ..... one cup of what? It often deletes the ingredient leaving me guessing.Now for the best part....my hard drive crashed and I asked for another download because I lost the program but still had the recipes on CD. I was told they don't have this software anymore so I will need to buy the new program. I don't want to buy the new program that is probably as bad as the one that I had. You can't tell me that this company doesn't have my program somewhere in their archives to help me out."
3,Family Feud Gone Wild,"I like to drop in on my Catholic upbringing every once in a while by picking up a Greeley novel and re-entering my adolescent fantasies by way of his. Here he has the all-American boy who stumbles upon millions of dollars without much effort, and he meets the most gorgeous girl in an Irish pub, again without much effort, and wins her hero worship by beating up on her nasty, mean old boy friend while resolving a 200-year-old feud, with the help of some combat-ready angels who appear out of swirling mists to make it all easy for him. That's the main problem with the book, it's all to easy and simple. He didn't have to use his own wits, energy and courage, he waited at ease and let the angel do all the heavy lifting. Maybe the author had his own angels, but if so, where were they when he got out of that taxi cab?"
2,"Pleasant fluff, but a really twisted message","This book essentially says that God will send his and/or her angels to watch over you, give you money, buy you all kinds of things, and help you find true love -- but only if you're white, rich, beautiful, smart, sexy, Christian, and preferably Irish.It's a pleasant enough love story, with the same old Greely plot and character types, but when you look back on it, you have to wonder: is God(dess) really so trite, banal, and capricious as to send angels (sexy, beautiful female angels, of course) to do all THAT for some computer nerd just because he happens to be named Tobias? Hmph."
4,Who says romance is dead? Not Father Greeley!,"Okay, let's go through the Greeley Checklist; Irish Catholic family, Check. Strong female lead, check. Sweet romance with a touch of danger, check. Happy ending, check. Yep, looks like the old Greeley formula. But as usual, he pulls it off in fine style. Patrick and Sara Anne are as engaging as my favorite Greeley couple, Dermot and Nuala from IRISH GOLD. And Raphaella, the angel with an attitude, is a delightful companion. One cavaet; The thug who terrorizes our heroes. I think I saw this same guy in IRISH LACE. Greeley needs to come up with some new villians. All in all, formulatic but expertly handled. Andrew M. Greeley never fails to entertain with his warmth, wisdom and knowledge of the human heart. First-rate fun!"
3,Father Greeley's view of angels is fascinating!,"However, I have the feeling, after reading this book, that Andrew Greeley may be suffering from his vow of celibacy. The descriptions of all the women with their ""wondrous"" breasts is getting really old. He needs to learn another word because this reader is sick of that one. The story is interesting and I always love his Irish people, the Irish dialect, and the Irish traditions. But please, can't we have some less than wondrous women in his books?"
4,Still one of the best!,"The beginning of the story was a little slow, however, things soon picked up and ended with a bang! Great, great romance scenes!"
4,"so far, so good","i bought this charger for my wooden boat which has an automatic bilge pump. what can i say... it's still floating and the battery has a full charge. that little blinking LED light is very reassuring. it is obviously not an all-weather unit but, with a little care, still very serviceable. i would be willing to replace it annually for the peace of mind it provides."
3,to early to judge,"bought this item to extend the life of my dying battery, but unfortunately the battery was too far gone for the charge from this unit to help. I had to buy a new battery and therefore can't really speak to the benefit of this product.That said there may be something iffy about its construction, probably something has come loose inside the unit, because sometimes the charge-indicator light won't come on until i squeeze the unit a bit."
1,Failed and overheats.,"I had this thing sitting inside my car to keep my battery maintained. I live in Maryland, so I have four seasons. It worked for 1 1/2 years and then it failed. Voltage won't go over about 2.5 and will swing wildly. I called Sunforce, but they told me i have to pay for the shipping. Shipping was gonna cost me probably 6 bucks, so I said forget it. Not really worth my time to package it and ship it out.It gets super hot in the sun due to the black frame and closed environment of the case, especially if you use it inside your car. The heat probably damaged the cell interconnect somewhere. Not really recommended for inside the car use, even tho this is what most people would probably use it for."
5,"15 volt output, nice.","This item, so far, works very well. Sunny 80+ Farenheit, we a put volt/ohm meter across the output leads of the solar cell and it's putting out a healthy 15Volts DC. Sweet. Now, the second car won't need an occasional boost with a PSX Power Unit after sitting idle for a bit."
2,Internal defective solder connection.,"Definitely not waterproof for outdoor use.Solder connection to ground side of solar cell will not stay electrically connected.Does not meet my need for boat trolling motor battery charging.Worked for about a week, re-soldered the connection, but it quit again after another week.By that time I had thrown away the box and return shipping label, so will try to re-solder it again."
4,Not enough oomph,"It is just as advertised, a battery maintainer. Liked the LED light that showed product was operating and the two sets of connectors. Therein lies the problem. The alligater clips positive polarity is the male probe on the connector and in the effort to not short out the solar collector connected the battery first before connecting the plug. Accidentally dropped the plug and the probe hit ground producing a wake up spark. Recommend manufacter reverse the polarity on the plug having the positive on the male probe at the solar collector side will not cause any problems since there is no return path with negative being the female side. Liked the concept so much opted to buy the 5 watt model to get more oomph of a trickle charger. By the way the 5 watt model has the same design flaw and does not have the LED light but is just what I wanted to keep the battery on the spare car charged without having to run it (waste gas) to do what the solar charger is doing."
4,"Works Great, saves money, but suction cups could be better","I bought a scooter, and as a result of not driving my car as much, its security system drained the battery. This solar trickle charger was all that was needed to make it start right up even if it sat for a couple of weeks. My only complaint is that the suction cups don't want to stick very well given the curvature of the window glass. It could use more suction cups or bigger or softer ones. Or a different attachment strategy altogether. I made hangars out of some thin, stiff wire to hook over the top edge of the window and roll it up. Works great and doesn't fall off whenever the temperature changes like the suction cups did.Car batteries are not designed to be deep discharged. One deep discharge in cold weather can destroy a brand new battery. This will not only save me inconvenience, but money."
2,cord contacts easily detached,"I read reviews about this solar panel, and they talked about the weak soldering of the cord to the solar panel. In the face of the other reviews that praised its benefit, I decided to take my chances.This panel works fine, but if you don't handle with care, it'll stop functioning all at once, like mine.The bad thing about it is that it must be hidden from sunlight when the engine is ignited, otherwise, they'll be really hot. May be they don't have a protection circuit.... I Think this should be taken care of in the design."
3,Battery maintainer,"Item works well enough but the plastic shell warps quickly, although it still works. Would recommend it being made from a sturdier plastic."
1,NO GOOD,Product is no good. Polarity of plug is wrong (center pin of lighter plug is negative instead of positive). Even then the output is only .01 volt in full Texas sun. Save your money!
1,disappointing,"after nearly 10 minutes of the blue LED light working (which I have to assume meant the product was actually working as well) it flickered and died. Came on one more time after i jostled the cord at the joint where it attaches to the unit. since they state that you need to check the voltage to see if it is working properly (since the LED light is THAT undependable) I had to then purchase a voltmeter to even see if the piece of crap was even working. SO, yes, I give this product and the experience one blessed star since it functions as well as broken product right out of the box.don't waste your money."
1,Did not work!!,I dont know how people can say that this thing works. The battery still discharged on my new car. Too weak for big car batteries. You will need at least 15 watts to make a real difference.
1,Sunforce 50012 Solar Battery Maintainer - CR@P,"I put the Sunforce 50012 inside my car's windscreen and plugged it into the cigar lighter. (On this car the cigar lighter is ""live"" even when the ignition is off). The Sunforce 50012 worked for one day. Next day it appeared dead (There is blue LED that blinks when it is working). I picked it up, it started working, sat it down, it quite. Twisted it, it worked, then it didn't, then it did. The old intermitant (sp) connection problem. Basically it was shot, dead, kaput, trash it. Long story short, I fixed it by taking it apart and re-soldering components. I am smart and lucky with nothing better to do. 99.999% of the users could not make this fix. So just forget about it. This thing is garbage."
1,Buyer beware,I put this battery charger on the dashboard of my car just like you are instructed.Within 3 days the frame warped and cracked open. I guess the sun is bad for it.Who would make a solar battery charger that can't take the heat and sun light?The charger feature still works but the frame is completely shot.I would not purchase again.
1,Too fragile!,"This product functioned, but offered no description in the instructions as to what the blinking light means. Sometimes it was on solid, sometimes it blinked.The first time I drove in the car I hit a pot hole and it cracked the solar panel. Keep in mind, the item did not fall off the window. The suction cups held it, but somehow the jarring force cracked it. Now it only blinks intermittently and a voltage meter test confirms that it doesn't charge reliably now. I gave it to my kid to play with.I would recommend looking for something a little sturdier unless you are going to take it out of your car before going anywhere."
2,Poor instructions,"I'm living in SG and decided to try it out on my Chevy Aveo.My gripe is there is no clearer instruction on how to use it apart from putting it together, plugging it to ciggy or direct. There's no instruction whether do I need a 'live' connection or not. If so, leaving my car keys on ON or ACC all the time when it's plugged in and I'm not near the car would pose some risks. Still unsure about the LED light, whether it means charging when blinking and lighted up or it means there's sufficient light."
2,Not for Outdoors,I bought this in the hopes that I could keep my boat battery charged -- until I read the fine print-- which said do not use outdoors. So I sealed up the unit real good with silicone -- but it stopped working at some point after less than 8 weeks of use.
1,Not reliable,"The first purchased item had broken solar glass. It was exchanged to the 2nd. one.The 2nd. one had reliability problem.After few days using, it broke down. No electricity no more generated.The item would be lemon."
2,melted in my window! killed my cap!,"I've had this for less than two days and this thing has started to deform from the heat of the sun(melted). its not supposed to be used while the car is on(would have been nice to know before i got it). Also it's illegal to use it in your front window as shown in the picture while driving. im going to try to use it to keep my battery booster boxes charged. This panel can't be used outside...so if its illegal to use it in my car, and can't charge a battery outside in the sun i can't think of many ways to use this(in a garage with a big sunroof maybe). After using this product my system's capacitor has stopped working."
2,Low Wattage,I just don't think 1.8 is a lot for the money. I would expect at least 5 watts before I would consider buying this.
4,Great for small R/C batteries,I'm using this to maintain the battery in my Prius while I store it. The suction cups don't work for more than three days and the installation wiring needed adapting to be safe enough for me to feel comfortable leaving it in my car unattended.
5,"works great, saved my truck","I park my truck (Ford F150) at a small remote airport and fly in with my Cessna 172 once or twice a month. So my truck sits a lot and gets driven less than 1000 miles a year. I put a good expensive battery in my Truck but it was still dying due to parasitic load and infrequent use. After a couple of dead battery experiences and having to carry a jump starter with me, I decided to try this.I've been using it for almost a year now and it works. My truck battery is always fresh and I don't need the jump starter anymore."
1,Too low current to maintain battery in a car / truck,"Bought it a couple of months back since my car is hardly used (just once a month or so).Kept it plugged in and exposed to sunlight which is good and strong in California.But the current is too low to maintain a modern car battery (since nowadays lots of electronic things are sucking power continuously such as alarm, clock, engine diagnostics etc).So the purpose of buying this was defeated and battery died as expected. So for cars / trucks kept for a long time without starting (say a month) instead of this, either buy a battery maintainer connected to the mains or a jump battery, both of which retails from $40 onwards. Don't waste money on this toy."
1,I had to repair this item after two days of use.,"I had to repair this item by resoldering all the connections inside it after two days of use. Basically this rendered to less than zero value to me since it now cost me 4 hours of install time repair time, in addition to its initial cost."
5,may be pricey,"I love Amozon I shop here All The Time ,But At This Deal Not Great, Harbor Freight, Sells The same Thing For 11,dollars and 45 cent."
3,Inexpensive and cheap; Junk throw it away,"Purchased the solar battery charger to keep a lawn mower charged while out on my lawn. The manual says that it should not be used outdoors, AND not come in contact with water. Not sure what the purpose of this product is then, and 1 page manual provides zero information. Upon opening the packaging, the top and bottom part of the plastic case were coming apart, and there was no gasket in between the two plastic parts (one reason i guess it is not waterproof). Connected it up, and left it charge for a couple weeks. The plastic case had already melted in several locations, and the wires to the battery had cracked (bad strain reliefs). I have ended up just throwing this away. It is inexpensive, but you pay for what you get with this product. Perhaps I got a bad product, but not willing to try another one."
1,"Bought 5, 3 died within a month","I purchased 5 of these hoping they'd work as a cheap alternative to the more expensive solar chargers/maintainers. That was partly true; two of the five did but the other three all died within a month. Unfortunately this company(based in Canada) doesn't offer any support or warranty, contrary to what they advertise. Very poor quality and no support."
2,Didn't work out for me.,I used this for my 7 year old battery that has trouble in the winter. The charger never worked for me. I think my battery was just too close to expiration. But I still have it I may test it on something else and update this review.
1,JUNK! DO NOT BUY. MINE QUIT WORKING IN LESS THAN A WEEK.,I bought this to maintain the battery on my riding lawn mower over the winter. It quit working in less than a week.
2,solar battery maintainer,this product doesn't work very well would not kept my car battery from running downluckly it was not expenseive
5,The best book by Platonov,"Geniously written and absolutely terrifying. After you finish reading, you will have the feeling that either you or Platonov must be crazy and then you will realize with horror that the world he describes has a structure and you can even see how it is making sense. Reading ""Chevengur"" is an experience that you will find precious and that you will never dare to repeat. Don't try to read more than 100 pages a day, however, if you care for your sanity. The main point is that Chevengur is NOT a satire on Soviet reality and Platonov does share the views of his characters. If you can accept that fact, this is a book for you. Otherwise, don't bother to ever read Platonov."
5,love it!,"We bought this product to try an update our kitchen cabinets. We couldn't afford 20,000 dollars to replace our kitchen. We bought this system and it works great."
3,"Not Winslow's best, but still pretty good","I found California Fire and Life to be at times fascinating and at times kind of silly. The hero, Jack Wade, seems to go out of his way to do the wrong thing, over and over again. For example, he's offered a second chance to spend his life with a sexy Latina, and punts. The passages laying out the nuts and bolts of investigating a suspicious fire were really interesting and well written. The 30 pages or so which were supposed to be the villian's backstory were over-the-top violent and not integral to the plot. And at the climax of the book, the villian, Nicky Vale, goes on a page-and-a-half rant/confession worthy of a Bond villian. The fiery conclusion is tailor-made for Jerry Bruckenheimer's next big dumb summer movie."
3,A Real Blood Boiler,"Lots of folk here love this book but I find it very uneven. When the author is describing how his arson investigator reads fires, he is obviously enthralled. But when he describes how insurance companies and the police conspire to reward the guilty and destroy anyone seeking justice, like his hero, he is less compelling. Is Winslow overreaching to make his villain not merely a ruthless California realtor but also an ex-KGB agent and member of the Russian Mafia? I might excuse that but then comes the funeral of his totally virtuous wife where the love of our hero's life is yelling, ""You killed my sister."" Naturally this woman is also an honest cop to boot. I will not spoil the ending here except to say that those who read many thrillers should not be surprised at the last plot twist. This book might provide psychological release for latent pyromaniacs."
4,Just another California beach person,"Having been raised in Laguna Beach - the magnetism of this book was irresistible. I can remember well, traveling up PCH in 1942 with our parking lights in my family's 1941 Super Delux Ford coupe.If you're not a Californian the story may escape you. If not - read it it. It's a classic.Just like James Ellroy - Don captures that unique and seedy underbelly of California social hirearchy - like it's there, but everybody denies it.Don Ross Bangkok"
3,Don Winslow's worst book,"in a five star deserving collection!The book is well written, fast paced and intense, and is tottally above average ( which is normal, being a Winslow's ) as a thriller, but the story is ""too normal"", too ""airport thriller"", for one from whom we are used to the very best."
3,Didn't melt me,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I look forward to reading more of his works in hopes of improvement in conciseness. The author truly knows his stuff when it comes to investigating fires. Just don't think he needed as much of the detail and regurgitating of same facts to convince us. It no longer became entertaining, nor a lesson. The story was interesting in its premise but had to suspend belief in some instances. All in all worth further watching."
5,A real page burner!,"Find out if an emigré Russian mobster turned his wife & home to shishlik for the insurance money. Well worth the read, and one of the best examples of what life is sometimes like for an over achieving insurance adjuster. True in many respects especially the details. Gives respectability to a field that most people only encounter by accident and often come away from that experience with a negative opinion. A negative is one thing this book isn't!"
3,Not bad at all,"This was the first book I have read of Don Winslow's and I found it quite good. He reminds me of James Ellroy at certain points and has a readable style that will make me buy more of his books when I can.I found this book to be original as I can't recall another arson investigator character although I haven't checked, I would assume it is a stand-alone rather than a series character as the subject doesn't seem to be one which could be repeated.I think the author displayed a little too much knowledge of fires by the copious detail that he went into, which tended to get a little dull at points but that is a minor quibble.Overall, worth a read and I am looking forward to more Winslow books."
2,Boring!,"Jack Wade an arson adjuster for California Fire and Life Mutual, he understands and reads fires like no other person I have ever come across. The first half of the book is exactly an EXTREMELY detailed version of how Jack reads fire and how he became an arson adjustor...unfortunately for me, I really can't endure page after page of detailed descriptions for fires and gas chromatography - and I am a scientist!Finally, after skipping several pages of descriptions about burn marks, patters on the wall and carpet, I finally see a story emerging, but by the time this happens, it is filled with ridiculous characters and plots that I can barely keep my eyes open..at four o'clock in the afternoon!I had to put this book down about 1/2 way through, I really didn't care anymore about 'whodunit' or 'why'...If you have insommnia or you really love fires, then buy this book but otherwise stick to Dennis Lehane, John Sandford or James Patterson for interesting crime/thrillers."
2,THe godfather gone wrong,"Think of the ending of Godfather 1 screwed up. I breezed thru (ie speed read) about half of this book. I really had a hard time liking any of the characters. A real dumb ending but frankly, I didn't care at that point. This is a poorly crafted book. I only gave it a extra star because I know the local. Dumb sex scenes, too much detail about fires, surf dudes that would be thrown out of Laguna Beach."
4,Winslow written life and times of a guy,"Winslow has the market on writing about a guy, who has faulted on something big in life and now looks ot make amends by staying true to himself. Like Frankie Machine, this book uses the same formula and it works, not as well as Frnakie machine, but it works. The sexual relationships between men and women are expertly crafted by this author."
1,Audio cassette version is terrible,"This might be a good book, but the audio version so put me off, I gave up halfway through. He did OK when it came to American males, but his Russian and Asian character voices were terrible (even offensive) and his attempts at a woman's voice was also bad. He should have just played it straight.Read the book -- avoid the audio cassette."
1,The first half is good...,"The first half of the book was great. The main character is engaging and the details of fire investigation are really fascinating. Somewhere around the start of the second half, though, the story becomes one ad hoc scene after another... the author seems to plot each chapter as a dramatic movie scene, then forces his characters to act out the scene whether or not it fits their previous style or characteristics (or the previous plot). By the end, I was quite upset I'd ever started reading."
1,Disappointment,What a disappointment! It sure looks like there's a good mystery in this book somewhere but digging through all the detail and ploding style is just too much. A great read if you're looking to become an insurance claims adjuster.
3,Loved him back in the day,"I ordered this and while it's a pleasant listen, fun, it's just not as funny as I recall him being when I saw him on TV or the movies he was in. It's definitely not bad, but I think he refined his stuff over the years."
5,41 minutes of laughs,"Rodney Dangerfield provides plenty of laughs here; mostly one liners about his health, his wife, his kids and his sex life (or lack of it).He uses the occasional expletetive but not too many. If you're a fan of his from movies like Caddyshack and Back To School then you're likely to enjoy his humour. If you don't know who he is then don't worry because even if you don't find every gag funny, he shoots them off so fast that you'll be laughing at the next one anyway.Near the end of the disc he takes questions from the audience and fires back some funny responses. I just wish the disc was longer."
4,Extremely Funny CD,I enjoyed this CD immensely. There was only one Rodney Dangerfield. His humor will be greatly missed. Thanks to video and cds we can listlen to him again and again.
1,What the deuce is wrong with all you people?!!!,"This horrible album really sucksHow'd it ever make the bucks?Rodney's Lyrics are lame, they just aren't funnyWhen I bought this album I wasted money.seriously people...this is terrible. I love Rodney as much as the next guy... but this is total crapola."
4,"Is he a loser, a smartalec, or just a genius?","""I get no respect"", has always been a Rodney Dangerfield trademark and if you have never heard Rodney's humor from his own mouth, then it is about time. This routine was recorded around 1979-80, and Rodney stayed in the limelight for about 10 years after this with various late night specials and even his own comedy show in 1988. In about 50 minutes of stand-up, Rodney goes from loveable loser, to a-hole, to sexual pervert, to jerk, to loser that is a jerk, to sarcastic twit, and finally to comic genius. Rodney was indeed the man, as his crazy jokes could indeed happen to anybody. I mean, who can't help but laugh at jokes about ""Rodney's wife"" being ""easy"", or even about Rodney seeing a naked guy jogging outside his house and when Rodney asks him why, the guy answers, ""because you came home early"".I don't know how to classify Rodney Dangerfield, but I do know that he is one of the greats."
4,Loved by the recipient,"I bought this CD for my husband, who is a great fan of Rodney. I discovered that by watching him watch Jay Leno do his impersonation on the Tonight Show. My husband just loves to hear Rodney's jokes and thoroughly enjoyed listening to this title in his car. He was able to repeat the jokes to me and to his friends, which made it a very worthwhile purchase as a Christmas surprise stocking stuffer. My husband believes in trying to make others laugh. Since Rodney's delivery is based on rapid one-liners, the comedy is easy to remember and to repeat. I would highly recommend this to anyone familiar with the great comedian."
1,Nothing but problems,"I purchased this computer for my daughter for college - thinking it would be a good computer to last through her four years of college. In the three years we have had it, I've had to replace the screen because it was coming apart, the battery died (an almost $200 item to replace), and just last week the hard drive failed. Even though it is only out of warranty a month and my daughter started having problems with it while it was still under warranty, Dell will not replace the hard drive. I will never buy another Dell product. I would advise anyone looking for a computer to not buy this product or any Dell product, for that matter. They have terrible customer service."
1,I agree with the other reviewer! This is a dog star!,"Romance novels should take you away from stuff like the trash in this book. The man blames his wife for his own perfidy and she wants him back. He can buy designer suits to make him look good but complains when his wife wears a four-year old outfit! His is a horrible husband and a worse father-cold,cold,cold. All he could think about was where he could put his private part. He may have stopped the affair but he wouldn't have if his wife hadn't found out. And, yes, Virginia, it was an affair. Men who think their whores(mistresses)should get better treatment than their wives need to be re-educated!!"
4,Well-written and philosophical but not about the mind of God,"Davies is a competent writer and knows his science. But if you want to read an interesting book that deals with the interaction of religion and science, take a look at The Bible According to Einstein."
3,Too many assumptions!,"This is a good book overall, but if never quite focus too well and it leaves the subject at the end with way too many assumptions that will make you feel like you have been running in circle and never really got nowhere. Overall: Decent to Good."
3,Too much at times,"Davies tries to interweave the beliefs of many of the world's greatest philosophers, like Jean-Paul Sartre and Kant, to modern day research and advancements in science.The ""Mind of God"" is actually just a book about the ideas of Davies. It is his idea and belief about the limits of science, and the meaning of science.I am not a physicists or a philosopher. The book is readable for the average person. Check it out if you get a chance."
3,Too many assumptions!,"This is a good book overall, but it never quite focus too well and it leaves the subject at the end with way too many assumptions that will make you feel like you have been running in circles and never really got anywhere. Overall: Decent to Good."
2,A Gray Hole,"Having read other books of this genre -- i.e., a search for meaning, not just syntax, in science, mathematics and the cosmos -- I found that Davies' book added little or nothing to my experience. Certainly, the title misleads, as it is mostly the mind of the author that is revealed here -- the conclusions about god or God come off as hesitant and weak. My personal ""core"" reading list would include ""Godel, Escher, Bach"" by Hofstatder; ""The Mind's I"" edited by Hofstadter and Dennett; one (but no more) of Hawking's books, perhaps the autobiography by White and Gribbin; ""The Emporer's New Mind"" by Penrose -- up to the point he begins claiming conciousness is a quantum process; and -- I'm serious -- the Foundation series by Asimov, in the order he wrote them, and with one or two of the robot/detective novels (e.g. ""Caves of Steel"") included along the way. This will provide both a more entertaining and more fulfilling glimpse of our place in the cosmic mystery"
2,God Thing - Is There One?,"I feel now that there is no god. Nothing is omnipresent or all-knowing. We have been duped so to call your book the Mind of God is an oxymoron. Whatever I had undergone from religoin is foul and nothing sees or hears me in the last 13 years so I doubt if anyone will see or hear a god, let alone know it. If you wish to know what has occurred to me for the last decade, let me know. It will blow your mind."
5,A Quantum mechanics must read!,Fairly easy to read; even for people with little knowledge of physics. Covers the scientific and philosophical implications of quantum mechanics.
5,A great thinker,"Paul Davies has been a favorite of mine for some time in the area of scientific writings for the layperson. And he delivers again with this book. Although I am not sure after having read it whether he believes in God or not, or if he is just using ""God"" as a euphemism for the intelligence that seems to permeate the universe. Each chapter will bring you up to date on the wonderful breakthroughs in science that are making us rethink the world we live in."
3,Good book but very slow,This is overall a good book but Davies' worst in my opinion. It doesn't have the clarity and there is nothing to compel you onward to the next page. I loved his other books but getting through this was a real chore.
4,GEO. WASHINGTON,FOR THE MOST PART I LIKED THE DVD. I WISH IT HAD DELVED INTO THE MT VERNON AND MRS MARTHA WASHINGTON PHASE OF HIS LIFE. STILL I WOULD GIVE IT A 4-5 STARS.
5,Amazing,"I accidently left my ultra powerful magnet which is used for magnet fishing on my tv. I turned the tv on and messed up my tv pretty good. I didnt think it could be repaired even with this device but after one round, my tv was back to normal again. Believe it!"
3,"Received a CD - not an ""audio cassette""","Beware! The description states ""audio cassette"" and I received a CD. The problem is that I ordered it for a child's tape player! Now I don't know if I should trust the descriptions."
3,Adequate fantasy.,"After a rocky start, this book becomes a decent way to pass the time. But it is far from a must read book, a page turner, or a classic. What has happened to the characters at the end is a surprise, but it is also the only way for the author to set up a sequel. Definitely a book where the plot dominated the characters, rather than one where they took the plot & author to places he didn't expect to go."
4,"Excellent Premise, a very good read","This is a very good book. It seems to be the start of a series, but I believe it should be left stand alone. The ending was a bit odd, but the book itself blended science and fantasy well. I highly recommend it."
2,not the best of his work,"I give Caverns' of Socrates 2 stars. It was the first McKiernan book I read and it started out okay, I was remined of an old book by Piers Anthony of the SAME plot. The ending was kinda contrived and I almost never picked up another of his books again. Because after I read Voyage of the Fox Rider I absolutely fell in love with Mithgar. While I would not recommend reading Caverns of Socrates, I would recommend his other books."
1,Pathetic,"These people giving this book five stars have got to be crazy, or has the world gone mad. I got through 200 of 400 pages and then had to put it down. It is the most amateurish piece of writing I have ever seen in my life! A 12 year old could write a better essay in school. The characters are way too perfect. All they do is grin and laugh at stupid jokes and they are flawless. The whole thing is just so implausible that it makes you want to scream. Do not buy this book, ok.If you want a great read, then go for the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series by george rr martin."
5,A truly captivating book.,"Mckiernan beautifully blends a riveting tale of science fiction with classic fantasy. This book was an interesting change from Mckiernan's usual fantasy universe, and I applaud his creativity. However, the fantasy storyline could have been slightly more developed, and I found the character Mark Perry rather annoying. Yet, overall, this was an amazing book, and I would recommend it to any fan of science fiction or fantasy. I greatly enjoyed the philosophical questions woven into the plot, and the scientific conjecture provided a perfect foundation from which this captivating story could be launched."
2,Sad to say disapointed,"I got through approx. 1/2 of this book & just couldn't continue. In the first chapter, i was a bit annoyed by the amount of time's the rain/storm was mentioned-but later when the amount of time's Cane's tea with 7 spoon's of honey & his displeasure-AAGHHHHHHHHH-stop already-REALLY?I also found myself just not really careing much about people involved. I've read other McKiernan book's & have loved them-just not this time."
1,How a perfect limitation about 3000 objects...,"Using the software along this book, students could only design very small logic, e.g. Xor, Nand, Nor. Insructor usually required students to design a basic 8-bit ALU layout in a class project assignment, so this book don't really help students to solve problems. And this book doesn't let us know how to revise the extracted file in order to simulate the designed circuit. I suggest this book should provide an additional chapter to cover the simulation part and pull-up the limitation to a reasonable degree.....at least a basic 8-bit ALU..."
1,This is the worst product I ever bought!!,"If you are planning to buy this do not!! Trust me I got one a week ago and it freezes your game,erases your saved game,and is not built well at all (it bends because of cheap materials and may crack)!! It doesn't work with all pokemon games and it comes with a code book for the pokemon games!! It freezes all Mario games such as Mario Golf!! Some games don't freeze. They totally erase your game!! Sometimes nothing happens. It just starts your game and the code doesn't work!! I returned it the next day. After I wasted my time reading the directions (which are confusing and they make typos that make a big difference such as how to turn it on)and trying to get it to work!! If you don't believe me then fine waste your money on this product!!"
1,Gee....,"...It does not enable the codes!kids uder 13,don't buy this...all it will just do is erase your game!!!!"
1,Worst,"It deleted my saved file and the cheats did not work. If you like this game, you are an idiot."
4,"Nice as hell, but be careful","This Gameshark Pro I bought at Funcoland with some money I got from trading some game in. I thought it was an awesome thing, because I had Pokémon Yellow at the time, and all these cheats I've heard of like catching Mew and all the Pokémon, Infinite money and so on. It works with almost any game. But use at your own risk. There is a great chance it can corrupt (delete) your information and may have to start a new game on Pokémon. Look at me, I needed to start my Yellow version over 15 times! :( It is great and all, but beware, if your game gets erased, don't go crying to your mom saying that your game was deleted and you worked so hard on it. If you are one who likes taking risks, buy it. But be careful."
4,wow!,"When i bought this gameshark i was thinging how cool it would be to have codes for a heck of a lot of games. i only have a few games, so i went for pokemon yellow first. There were so many codes from infined life to geting mew. WOW!"
4,This thing rocks!!!!,"I think that GameShark rocks for Game Boy. This attachment allows you to do all sorts of things on your game. The best part about it is the cheats that you can use. I couldn't wait until I was able to get my hands on one. The bad part about it is when you download or upgrade it with your computer. It sucks, it destroyed my GameShark. I had to exchange it for another one .... I think you should buy this, but if you do, be careful about downloading or upgrading your GameShark!!!!"
1,Horible!!!,This was not good at all it rewined all of my games and my friends game.It erased every last one of my games!When I gave it a rating of 1 star although I couldnt give it 0 of them whoever reads this do NOT get it its horible!
2,Causes game crashes and deletes saved games,"Cheating using the Gameshark alters the game's memory and causes it to become unstable. This can cause 'junk' characters onscreen, crashes, and can delete saved games. Use at your own risk."
1,ruins the pride of beating a game,"Yeah I know they call it a game enchancer but all it does is cheat,Of course some people like to cheat their favorite games but heres the catch.All the gameshark does is modify the games program,when it modifies the program it doesn't debug the program at all,and you know what that means many glicths can occur after doing the cheat code such as The game will pause and not do anything until you shut off the game.If you save your game while using the code the next time you'll play there's a good chance that you'll your game save,and losing a game save can be very tragic to some people.Buy it if you wish but I warned you..."
2,Review of the GameShark,"I don't really like using the GameShark a whole lot. Whenever I use it,it restarts on me after I type in a code. Thats basically why I don't like using the GameShark."
3,Pokemon red,I can't get any of the codes to work. I'v tried everything and read the instroction bookabout 13 times. I need help getting the codes on to my game.
1,the worst thing,"I bought a game shark with great expectations from the other reviews i read, but i was greatly let down. I thought that it could help all of my games with great codes as advertised. Of the 18 gameboy games i own, only about 3 had cheats, most of which were completely useless. I also tried to use this game on my pokemon game. From what i had heard from my friends, these cheats were very useful in your game play. well, at least it will help ONE of my games i thought, but again, i was wrong. MY ENTIRE GAME WAS DELETED! I had to start all over again and it took me 22 hours to get back where i was in the game. I was completely wrong when i bought this game, and you will be too if you buy it. I brought it back within a week. Spare yourself and your money and DONT BUY THIS GAME! IT IS A BAD BUY!"
4,This is great for GBC!,"this is great, espiecially for game boy color! the old game shark didn't fit in gbc. Now there's a gameshark that does. The reason I gave this fourstars instead of five is that this game is not compatible with certain games."
3,O.K. ...just follow the directions...,"This product is great for beginner gamers...as long as you follow the directions...if you don't...then you will MESS UP YOUR SAVED GAME!!! But, if you pay attention...and don't try to get around the rules...then this could be a great product! the gameshark is good if...you are stuck in your game and con't win even with the help of a walkthrough...you just like to cheat...you are an experienced gamer who just wants to see what its like to take the easy way around...ect...ect...ect..."
1,Cheaters never win,"i bought this product fron toys r us. it looked like i could finally win the game i've been playin for ever. i hooked the computer cable into the gameboy.i started to look at cheats,when,the screen was blank.i tried everything,i returned it and got another 1,but the same thing happend again.i wanted to warn u about this product."
1,It could be BETTER!,I think the GameShark software should have been tried out by the makers. Be cause i had one and i loaded it into my computer and updated my files and the software messed up my gameshark. So i think gameshark should discontinue the game shark software until they fix it!
5,pimpin it,This cd is a real good description of how the real homies like to chill. It has some of the best artist in the chicano rap society. The songs are real smooth and the beats are somethin you could flow with it's real down wit da brown society. Peace out homies & keep cruuizin
4,A Good Mix With A Few Stellar Tracks,"I was just getting into trance music when I saw this on sale at a local music store and picked it up, thinking it couldn't be that bad. I was right; this is actually quite a good mix. But what I really liked about it is that the standout tracks really helped me realize where to go from here. This was a good CD to get me into the genre, and the track listing told me what to get next, namely Deepsky and John Digweed, to name a few. ""Cosmic Dancer"" and ""Heaven Scent"" remain two of my favorite tracks to this day, and I wouldn't have the CD collection I have now if it weren't for this disc. So I guess in the end, if you're just getting into trance music, this is a good place to start. Seasoned veterans of the rave scene will find fault with this disc on a few different levels, and will already have heard many of these tracks, but everybody else will like it."
3,"Second-tier compilation, but has some bangin' tunes","Noel Sanger does a good job of putting together some really nice passionate trance anthems on this compilation, the follow up to last year's ""Trance I"" (which was pretty bad - all anthems and no style). However, although this 2 CD set is far better than it's predecesor, exhibiting more style and skill than whoever mixed the first in the series, it very much feels like a freshman DJ's attempt at putting together a compilation of current progressive anthems. Sanger's mixing style isn't that interesting or exciting. The only track that really stands apart from the rest, Deepsky's ""Cosmic Dancer"" (CD 1, #7), doesn't make up for the compilation's somewhat cheesy feel all in all.Fun and definetly heading towards a more progressive/spiritual sound, but not recommended for the seasoned progressive enthusiast. Highly recommended for those new to Trance and progressive House."
1,The Thesis on Goth Subculture in Sociology,"If you are an academic and like reading other people's doctoral dissertations or small cheap books they wrote after receiving their degree, then this is the book for you! If you are a person who is trying to find out more about the Goth subculture along with other dark cultures that seem to be embodied in it, then avoid this book. I found this book to be very poorly written, non-explanatory and extremely dull and boring! You can see on the cover that the original photograph of the couple was in color, but why he chose to make all the photographs in the book in black and white, other than to save money (cheap, cheap, cheap!), I'll never know. Most of the basis of Goth culture revolves around dark or black clothing and fashion with oftentimes splashes of color here and there. This book is not worth the read!"
1,"insta-goth, apperantly.",i don't even need to read this book to know how disgustingly inaccurate it is. any book claiming to be about the goth subculture that puts some vinyl fetish babe with fake hair on the cover is wildly mistaken.buy some aquanet and an alien sex fiend album insead.
4,dated but a good read,THis is an important analysis of the conflict over palistine prior to 1948. Begining in the 1930s the author details the struggles that led to an Israeli state. THis is also an important work to understanding the present conflict. It details arab terror that is not a new weapon but one that has been used for many years. It details the Jewish terrorist organization who fought the British. It details the arguments in Britian that led to a redrawing of the lines of the Jewish state. An easily readable but dated history.
2,too small for men,"Nice watch but it is too small neither for men nor women, the title is mislead and it should be ""Swiss Army Child XLT watch"". Finally, I gave it to my daughter."
4,Affecting Sept. 11th tale,"Leave it to Neil Labute to provide a view of September 11th that has little to do with waving flags and stalwart heroes. On the contrary, his tale deals with people too self-absorbed and cowardly to act in any way other than that which satisfies their own immediate desires. They realize they are in the middle of a national tragedy, and they want to be brave and selfless, but it's not in them. This is a situation that probably occured all over this country in the days following the attacks, but of course was never reported. Deception and adultery don't make good press in a time when we're all supposed to be united and courageous. LaBute shows us the truth, ugly though it is. A worthy read."
5,Absolute must for any work in the field.,"The aim of the book is to bring together key papers in Machine Learning and to provide an introduction to the field and a reference collection for graduate students and researchers. The book contains 51 most imoportant article from Machine Learning (up to 1990). Most of these are NOT available online, so watch out! The following areas are covered: Introduction (3 papers; one by Simon), Inductive Learning From Preclassified Training Examples (16 papers including great classics from Quinlan, Michalski, Mitchell, Minsky...), Unsupervided Learning and Concept Discovery (9 papers -- Feigenbaum, Holland...), Improving the Efiiciency of a Problem Solver (10 papers including fameous Samuel's gem ""Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers""; also papers from Mitchell, Nillson, Utgoff...), Using Preexisting Domain Knowledge Inductively (13 papers; Russel, etc...). Really really outstanding collection and a definite recommendation."
5,Very good film...,"The acting sold me on this one, the lead actress annelyn is astoundingly great , esp in the final scene as is Traci Lords whom deserves to be considered a great actress for this work..Disturbing because there could really be a Patricia out there...."
3,Frightening and strange,"Definitely one of the stranger and more intense films I've seen recently. It really doesn't hold anything back in the gross out department. It can be somewhat heavy handed at times, and feels a little pointless in parts, but overall it's a decent film that doesn't compromise."
5,"One of the most shocking, disturbing and downright entertaining films I have ever seen","I have been waiting for a movie like this for I don't know how long; a film that melds true wit in its comedic writing, and ends not as a comedy, but as a truly horrifying film. To say anything else would ruin what is one of the best films I have ever seen.The acting was phenomenal, especially that of the lead (Anna Lynne McCord) and Traci Lords, who was vicious as a controlling mother who disapproved of her own daughter; the horror was visceral, yet not overdone, and the story was simply entertaining, with some of the best writing in a horror movie in years. Watch this if you really want to see how a film in genre can be done right. I cannot sing higher praises for this film. It truly is a masterpiece."
3,I had high hopes,It could have been great if they wouldn't have tried so hard. The dream/fantasy sequences were supposed to be disturbing but were just to over the top.
1,Dont Watch This!,"Stupid boring disgusting movie... total garbage... save your four bucks. I almost spent alot on tickets at Sundance to see this, soooo glad I didnt"
4,Brilliant & Twisted!,"What a brilliant twisted little movie this is!! It's pretty clear that it's not for everyone, but for those that enjoy a darkly twisted but fun ride then this is the movie for you. The acting is superb too! I'm so glad AnnaLynn Mccord did this movie, she could have so easily got stuck as the ""Naomi"" type in many roles to come. I hope she keeps doing oddball movies like this."
4,A good movie for a rainy night.,"Blu-ray quality-very goodStory:Strange,but personally,I liked it. Movie reviews are so subjective,so I won't deal with that aspect.If you like something different,this may be for you. Good performances,decent camera work,and a freaky story.Overall,i can say I have done far worse than this movie,but I am satisfied with what I got."
3,Different,Was not what I thought it was. It was a different movie but was okay to watch. People that like this kind of movie would love this one.
3,"Considering the genre, not too bad....","I like my horror not way off the believability charts. I don't do zombies, ghosts, monsters, vampires, etc. I just like human beings being crazy. This film falls right into that category."
4,Love the dark theme,"I really loved the dark theme of the whole movie, it had a real taste of film to it. It wasn't just another remake like what we've been seeing in theaters. Truly excellent story and what a heart wrenching ending."
2,Hilariously Bad,"Excision is so bad that it's funny, but not funny enough that it's worth the $3.99 rental cost. Besides the majority of the film being incredibly boring, the ending is so logically flawed I can't wrap my head around how anyone thought it was a good idea.***Spoiler*The main character is supposed to be really into medicine but she can't figure out that trying to give her sister a lung transplant in the garage is a freaking bad idea? She doesn't even know if the other girl, that she murdered for the lung, is compatible. I know she's supposed to be a nut considering how much she researched she should have been able to figure that much out.**End Spoiler**I gave it two stars for Annalynne McCord, she did a decent job considering the horrible plot and script."
3,excision,"This was a crazy yet very weird movie.It kept me watching to see what would happen next.I think the whole idea and point of this movie was really strange.This is about a social path that has a very dimented imagination.If you are in to weird dimented movies then you will enjoy this movie alot,but if you're looking for a movie with a strong plot, then you will not."
2,Not my thing...,"Freaky stuff! Too over the top for me. If there was a message I couldn't get beyond the absurd visuals in this movie. Today, you can make a movie like this... but should you? To appease a certain niche I guess."
2,Was hoping for more...,Was hoping for more weird scenes but they were too few and far between... and the ending didn't sit well.
1,BORING,Rented this because of high ratingsAre you people numb?Very slow moving. Yes we know she has emotional problems in the first ten minutes of the film but nothing to keep your interest thereafter.Finally climatic but at the very end. That's it.Don't waste your money.
4,"Good, but I wasn't crazy about the ending.","This is an unusual movie. There is some seriously dark humor in it. The fantasy scenes look like moving art. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I did not like the ending."
5,AMAZING,Great film. Very short and to the point. The characters are very gripping as is the story. Love AnnaLynne and Traci!! Oscar worthy performances.
2,Really a very strange movie,"Traci Lords acting was very pained, and painful to watch. The only time in the movie that is wasn't very obvious she wastrying to act was at the very end of the movie."
2,I tried to like it,"most of the movie was boring, only some in the beginning was good and the ending but the majority was boring, don't watch it, I give it a 2 because it's below acceptable, 3 would mean it's worth watching, 2 means it's not"
1,Stupid,This movie makes no sense to me. The crazy girl and her wierd dreams. There is no real climax to the movie at all. Don't waste your time
1,Miserable.,I am not entirely sure that the individuals who rated this movie with more than one star saw the same movie I just watched. This was honestly the single worst movie I have ever seen in my entire existence. This movie had absolutely no plot whatsoever and it is a shame I will never get that $4 back.
4,"Solid, well-intentioned fun","A Hound Dog Taylor tribute album filled primarily with other Alligator Records artists is a sound idea, because there would be no Alligator without Hound Dog. It's to the credit of each artist here that he manages to sound like himself and not like a Hound Dog imitation. And it's to our benefit that those artists include titans such as Luther Allison and Magic Slim. Sometimes they reach too far afield, as if they're trying to show how far Hound Dog's songs will stretch (Vernon Reid's acoustic number is tasty playing, but electricity was the very soul of Hound Dog's art). All-round, though, the performances range from very-good to excellent, most of Hound Dog's best songs are covered, and it's a great treat to hear George Thorogood sounding like his old indie-label self. (Special mention has to be made of the cover by Lil' Ed & the Blues Imperials: one of the hottest, finest blues performances in years!)"
5,Hound Dog Tribute,The bands that have contributed in many cases have done their best work. Great album.
3,this hound dog is hit and miss,"Some of the songs on this cd are very good , and though not like the Hound Dogs version are still good .. Am I the only one who reviewed this who doesn't think that Sonny Landreth smokes his cut ? It doesn't sound anything like the original , but Sonny is an entirely different guitarist .."
1,Not made for Mac,"When you purchase Macintosh applications you expect the applications to carry forward the ease of use that you have come to expect form Mac's. This product falls short of that goal. The user interface is very difficult to figure out on it's own, and referring to the users manuals is of no use. The manuals only give repetitive and very basic info that is useless when you have a specific problem or question. I have Managed My Own Business for years just using Excel, I had hoped switching would make things simpler. The auto import feature for importing bank and credit card statements is a joke. From what I have heard from users of QuickBooks 5 is that they are no better off. Hey Apple how about your new app being iAccountant!"
1,"Slow, Slow, Slow","I upgraded from v2 with great enthusiasm. All I got was the run around.An invoice that took 15 seconds to process on v2 takes 1 1/2 minutes toprocess on v3. Called tech support to inquire about the problem, They said it should run faster than v2, fax computer configuration. Did that twice. No answer. emailed my account file. One week latter, still were to busy to look at it. O yes, if you want to use multi-user platform you must buy another computer to act as the server only."
3,Not Bad,"This game had potential. Beautiful graphics, good control. However, in an effort to bring out as much realism as possible, it is extremely difficult to figure out where the trail is. Also, the MTV reject voice dude gets on your nerves."
4,A hit game for the dreamcast,"Rippin Riders presents a snowboarders dream.There are 5 tracks in all with 2 bonus. Each track differs greatly and each track is another adventure. The tricks range from grabs to pulling 1080 mistys or a 1800 spin off a jump. Pulling 360's and 720's might take only 20 minutes to master, but learning to pull a 2540 may take hours. To achieve all tracks is for the most part hard, but not impossible. It took me a good 2 1/2 hours to get all courses. Many of the tracks are more of an adventure and can sometimes be boring. I found cave slider to be very annoying as it took me a good hour to master the track. Other than that the tracks are for the most part fun and can last for hours of gameplay. The graphics suffer and do not live up to Dreamcast expectations. The framrate has a few minor problems but for the most part is up to par.If youre looking for a game with great gameplay pick this one up. Gameplay-9.7 Graphics-5.2 Presentation-7.0 Lasting Appeal-9"
1,no depth to this game,"This game got REAL OLD after about an hour. There is not much to the game after you've explored the one-on-one racing and the half-pipe trick course(s) a few times each.On top of that, the soundtrack is horrible and annoying. It reminds me of a Commodore 64 game I used to have -- I think it was called ""Boogin'""."
2,Rippin' Riders,"My kids got this game and didn't like it at all. They said the tracks were hard to stay on and were hard to see, then finding the trail again was very difficult."
4,Better than 1080... you have to learn the game first,"I ordered two games.. NHL2K and this one.. I played NHL forabout an hour (sux).. popped this one in and have been playing itanytime I'm at home.. It's addictive the same way 1080 was.. Trust me, this game will be played as much if not more than NFL2k was played on your DCast.. the 2 player mode is great, if you perform tricks, the opponents screen gets smaller..and the graphics are great Buy this game!"
2,"Snowboarding Fans, Wait For The Next One...DON'T BUY THIS","I was very excited about getting Rippin' riders, the first snowboarding title for dreamcast, but when I got it, i wish i hadn't. While yes the courses are very attractive, they take about 20 minutes to finish, and you have check points to get to, and it took me about 7 times to finish the first course. Also you can't race the next track, unless you finish the first one. But the thing I hated the most was the fact that the superpipe mode where you do tricks, was nearly impossible to do anything cool looking, and landing was near impossible, and the announcer always says the same thing, which had me at times yelling at him to shut up. So Bottom line is wait for the next snowboarding title, don't buy Rippin' Riders!"
4,Cool new game!,"This game has cool graphics and funky tricks. In some of the courses, they need more lighting. You can hardly see where you're going. When that happens, you run into walls and get stuck and not even a jump can get you going again. It's an okay game."
3,"Excellent graphics, annoying commentary!","Being a die hard snowboarding fan, I purchased this game. I was hoping that it would be more like Coolboarders. The graphics are superb though. The main problem I find is that most of the spins and flips are highly uncontrollable. Unlike Coolboarders. The standard moves are pretty neat, but they too get boring. I wish you could shut that announcer up without losing all the cool sounds of the game. Don't get me wrong, the game is a lot of fun, however, if I were to rate it based on playability, I'd have to give it less stars. Perhaps Rippin' Riders Two will have these standard control features. It's a real shame since this same company (UEP) also made Coolboarders. Why would they not add the same functionality?Graphics: 9 Stars Sound: 5 Stars (Annoying commentary gets really old) Control: 5 StarsEnjoy"
2,"All talk, no action","A lot of the men in this ""movie"" are absolutely gorgeous... BUT, there is no real action in this movie, only monologues from men, telling their individual stories."
4,bravo Lucy !,"Sans parler de référence ce disque est très beau.Belle sonorité, un sens de la construction baroque et un respect de l'émotion font que ce disque est intéressant à prixabordable. R.R"
3,Bach Here Is an acquired taste,"I will admit that at first I hated this cd. The only partita I liked was the the last one with the famous prelude. Yet you know what, It grows on you. What sounds like a bouncy bangy violin on it's last leg of life can eventually be appreciated as music. Listen enough and you will hear the rhythm that Bach is so well known for, with the intricate textures, it's all there. The hardest thing to get past I guess was the old violin sound. It does'nt have near the loudness of modern violins, but it can still be appreciated. Basically, if you like Mozart AT ALL, you well like Bach, but Bach is more hard core classical. And he tends to grow on you, somehow someway."
4,Haitian Music: a crash course,This is the perfect introduction to Haitian music this CD covers all genres and spans a few generations. The choice of music and bands is exellent.
4,really enjoy,Like the sound quality of these cd's. Billboard brand seems to be better than the party ones. This one has some of my favorite songs on it. Looking forward to purchasing more Billboard brands in the future.
3,extremely disappointed with editing,"I watched this show when it aired, I wanted to see it again, unfortunately, too much has been taken out, the relationship between the characters was the main attraction for me and half of the cast was barely shown. If I hadn't seen the original, a lot of what happened in the edited version wouldn't have made any sense, As it is, I spend most of the time explaining to others who had not seen the show why certain events too place etc... A word should be sent by the creators of the novelas that their work has been downgraded to incomprehension. This is not the first novela that I have bought and found wanting , but this time they went beyond editing, some scenes were switched around in order for the story to make sense, and some relationships vital to the story were obliterated."
2,Missing one third of the air time.,Its missing to many scenes and the story between caracters gets lost. the story about second caracters is ignore. I was really disapointed. I wish they would release this title incluting the entire air time.I was going to buy the other titles but when I saw how they chopped this title I am not going to unless they have the complete version.
5,"Well edited, great soundtrack, excellent quality video on the DVD.","1) Quality and editing:For someone who has not watched the original version on TV this will definitely be an enjoyable and addicting story to watch (it will be very hard to stop once you start watching it!)I have to say that Telemundo/Universal is doing a much better job than Televisa in the DVD release department of ""condensed telenovelas"" as the editing is smoother and much more seamless.2)Content:I do agree with the fans that complain that too much content has been cut out. I really don't know why these multi million dollar corporations can't release larger versions without compromising the content and the story so much (cut out the excess ""filler"" scenes and episodes used to extend the life of a sucessful drama while it is on the air, but leave the complexity of the stories and characters intact!)"
3,NOT HAPPY WITH EDITING,THE SERIES HAS BEEN EDITED IN A WAY THAT VERY IMPORTANT SCENES ARE MISSING. IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THE SERIES WHILE IT AIRED ON TELEMUNDO DURING IT'S SEASON -- YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY THIS DVD SET. STILL ENJOYED WATCHING IT A SECOND TIME
3,Cuerpo Del Deseo review,"I have watched the Cuerpo Del Deseo in a television series and that is what made me to buy the product.However, after watching the purchased product I discovered that it is highly abridged with lots of scenes cut off and this made me sad. This is not fair."
1,NOT COMPLETE,Its 143 episodes 45 minutes each. The DVD crammed the entire novel in 12 hours. What do you think?
5,very intresting telenovela,"this my 3rd telenovela i saw , and i will not be wrong if i said this one is the best , as a story with some mystery , good story from ( julio jimenez) the same writer for ( passion de gavilanez ) and with the same star in passion de gavilanez ( Mario Cimmaro ) ..telemubdo dvds much better than televisa , they give it to you with good box set 5 dvds the last one for special features , this telenovela with english subtitle ..its very very intresting :) don`t miss it ."
1,Incomplete episodes,"To say I was disappointed will be an understatement. I had watched about six episodes of el cuerpo del deseo in Nigeria when I went on holidays. I bought the dvd in hopes of continuing where I left off. As I watched the previous episodes, I realized that most interesting and main scences where cut out. The dvd seemed like a summary instead of a story. For example, I didn't see Isabella's mother who was a total comic in the soap. Why they would do something like that, I have no clue. Not a great buy, I would say."
3,"enjoyed, but disapointed",I watched the show when it was on TV. I was expecting this to be the complete series. It was chopped apart. They skipped alot of parts.
2,Cuerpo del deseo,"The sound is terrible the music in the back is so loud you can not understand what the actors are sayon, i'm disapointed"
4,Comentario Sobre la Edicion en Dvd de El Cuerpo del Deseo,"Me Encanto el Dvd. Contiene un Muy Buen Resumen, no se notan cortes bruscos y se puede seguir perfectamente el hilo de la Historia. Si bien faltan muchas Escenas tiene Lo Mas Importante de la Telenovela. El Resumen tiene una Duracion de 12 Horas y ademas Material Extra con Bloopers, Detras de Camaras, Entrevistas y demas...Realmente Lo Recomiendo!!! No Se Van a Arrepentir!!!Es una Exelente Historia y Muy Dinamica."
1,no completo,no sirve no esta completa es un frude completo son solo 12 capitulos que se resumen en 5 una porqueria completa por favor no engane a la gente sobre todo los dvd vienen malos no sirve o sa en pocas palabras un robo
4,Fun show to watch!,"I speak almost no Spanish but, because my friend does, she got me into watching spanish soap operas on telemundo with her. This one wasn't on at the time, but she wanted to watch it with me so we ordered it. It was nice to be able to understand what people were saying for once because of the subtitles, and the storyline, even if it is a bit strange, is great. I was surprised to find that it had substance and wasn't just about sexual desire, which was what I thought from the title. But I was disappointed to find that a lot had been edited out, but luckily my friend caught me up on important parts. Unfortunately, through the editing, character introductions and important plot parts are cut out so sudden ""Who is that?"" and ""Since when are they together?"" type things happen, making it difficult to follow at times."
5,"Wow, what an original and cool story that will keep you tuned in!",Mario Cimarro and Lorena Rojas are really good. I first saw Mario in Passion del Gavena and I liked his acting then but this is even better! The soundtrack with Lorena Rojas singing is out of this world.I know French and I don't know Spanish but these latin soaps on DVDs are helping me learn Spanish.This is a really good story. I feel weird because I never could stand more than 5 seconds of American soaps. Gorgeous latin women!
4,It left me thugged out,"The book"" Thugged Out"" by Kym Fynn depicts the whole attraction of the Good girl, Bad boy Stereotype with a twist that makes you want to read twice as fast.Von the good looking drug slanging entrepreneur with the all women are to be used and discarded personality meets Alecca. A beautiful strong Black woman with a plan in life and a Plan for Von in her life.Unfortunately for Alecca. Terri and Michey have the same Plan. So who wins? You will have read it to find out. It is definitely worth your time.Nina Dupont-ReviewerBig Time Publishing Magazine"
1,Beware,"This software has majot bugs in that it will cut the bottom of your page also it will not discern letter from legal size of incoming fax and to make things worse, Smith Micro was aware of this problem at publishing time...."
3,It's OK,"The Arcsoft Panorama Maker 4 is OK. If you have a simple picture series, it will work OK. However, if you start clustering shots with slightly odd angles, it produces a distorted image and not all of the edges align. The software doesn't save the panorama in layers, so you can't hand correct misalignments later. It's a pretty simple program, fun to play, but not a cure-all."
1,ArcSoft Panorama Maker 4,"While I enjoyed the free-trial version of this product, having inserted the software disc into the computer quickly became a nightmare. I was not given a license number to even allow me to go beyond a set-up screen. I also could not register the product and received no helpful information from ArcSoft, or whoever designed this software. With all the online manuals on their site for each product, one did not exist for Panorama Maker 4. I purchased and chose to have the actual software mailed instead of downloading, since the free-trial version refused to work the first time I attempted to use it. Definitely do not buy any ArcSoft products."
2,Not as expected,"Each month I take a series of pictures on the walls of a three sided room ( 180 degrees)off of a hallway for an art gallery web site. The result I want is a horizontal sliding picture, this program stitches the pictures into one non sliding picture and it also distorts the picture where the wall turns 90 degrees with an unusable result.I went to Arcsofts FYI page and others had the same question as to this result and were told that future updates would correct this and in fact make a sliding picture.I keep checking for an update and so far none, so the program does nothing for me."
3,Good but not the Best,"I benefited from reading this book, but when I subsequently read Bruce K. Waltke's ""Finding the Will of God"" I found the latter to cover the same ground much more systematically, comprehensively, and clearly - to the point that I feel the urge to write this short review to point prospective buyers to consider Prof Waltke's book instead."
3,liked the cinnabon lattes better,I tried this product but I prefer the cinnabon lattes better. the starbucks coffee has a funny burnt milk taste
5,Pretty and sturdy luggage tag,"I bought this as a gift for family to quickly identify their luggage during an upcoming trip to Japan. The tag is unique and pretty. I love the plastic insert in the back for identification information. This product suits my needs perfectly, is sturdy and should last many years."
1,1?????,I wish I had read the review earlier. I also only recieved 1 insted of a 10 pack. Over 4 dollars in shipping charges.
2,The software is better than the watch,"Definitely disappointing; Tons of features + killer training software + horrible accuracy = 2 stars; I have found some serious discrepancies between what the watch displays & what it records. First of all the 520 only records every minute, I can look at the latest workout and see a maxHR of 188 but after transferring to the computer it is 168!!! Junk! My friend just got the 720 which records every 5sec, I'll see if he likes it before considering an upgrade but I'm also eyeing the German tool team postal uses 'Ciclosport'"
2,Skeletons on a Tin Roof,"... is how Sir Thomas Beecham described harpsichord music, and I have to agree (he actually said it sounded like the skeletons were copulating on a tin roof in a thunderstorm).On this recording, the playing, while accurate, is often slow and ponderous, and while the harpsichord sound is clear and the playing even, it jangles the nerves after a short while, and of course the harpsichord is inherently unable to bring out the inner voices of the many beautiful canons, dances, toccatas, and fugues in this monumental work.I much prefer a bright Steinway sound, in competent hands, which brings out all the color and texture, without scrambling the brain!"
1,Speechless,"Without the singlest doubt, Wanda Landowska wouldn't allow mr. Jarrett even washing the dishes for her, let alone play her harpsichord."
5,Carpe Critique,Normally self motivation books fail to keep my interest. However Carpe Aqualis maintained a nice pace and fluidity. A good read.
5,Surf with Frank and change your life!,"Life is changing faster than any of us could ever imagine and Frank F. Lunn gives us the tools to deal with that change in his new book Carpe Aqualis! Using seven essential surfing skills Lunn teaches us how to ride those waves of life. Not only ride them, but master them. He shows us that we can turn those difficulties into advantages and have the life we desire. It's a lively, positive book that is hard to put down."
1,Save your money,"Save your money, buy a Hallmark Card or a bag of fortune cookies, either of which will dig as deep as this book."
4,"RICK ""SHAQ"" GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""BLUES WORLD NEEDS ANOTHER ""HOLE"" TRIP TO CHICAGO!""","Out of Dave's 7 CD's, this is the 2nd best, behind ""THE LIVE ONE"" (See prior Shaq review!) it's a distant 2nd, but also way, way, ahead of 3-7. A number of these songs are also on the ""Live"" album in a longer format. As of this writing 1/20/07 I'm told Dave has a new release coming in February 2007, he's disappeared for years. I hope it's like these 2 and not the other 5. This is worth purchasing for any slide guitar fan. I have my finger's crossed awaiting his next release."
3,"Nice to play against humans, but AI has very little intelligence",First of all let me say that the boardgame is a great classic. I've been playing it ever since it came out decades ago.Things I like about the computer version:1) The look of the map2) The look of the units3) The helpful counter that tells you how much further a unit can move4) The easy pop-up screens to purchase units and develop techsThings I dislike about the computer version:1) The AI is dreadfully awful even on the highest rankingsa) Playing the Axis against the most difficult AIs I easily had an economic victory in 3 rounds the first time I played; 4th round the second timeb) Playing the Allies I overran Germany & Japan with very little resistancec) The AI is way too happy to sacrifice a plane to save a ground unitd) The AI doesn't have a clue about building factories in critical places2) The otherwise nice pop-up screens for purchasing units get in the way of seeing what is actually underneath on the map
4,A great game.,"Yes, the computer opponant sucks, but otherwise this is a decent adaption of the board game. When you are playing human opponants, it works quite well. The game does tend to crash when you try to play online with more than two people, though. At least now I can play online though, even if it is usually against only a single opponant. I'm dissapointed that this game is no longer available. I know a few people who are A&I players that didn't buy it when it was available, and they certainly would like a copy."
1,Terrible Artifical Intelligence,"The AI is terrible, making the game a breeze to win even if you control only one country. The AI is non-agressive and seems to have a programmed propensity to buy ships to fight your non-existant fleet.This game should only be bought if you have a friend to play it with."
4,Ken,Follows the board-game pretty closely. Anyone who enjoys the style of the board-game will probably enjoy this computer version. The AI strategy could be better though. Overall I enjoy playing this version on computer. A lot of the time consuming tasks of the board game are calculated automatically by the computer saving a lot of time.
4,Axis and Allies,"Good game, though dated graphics lack the flash and computer AI is weak in later stages of the war. Would recommend to anyone who has played the board game."
2,ease of use and playability don't outweigh COUNTLESS bugs,"It's too bad that such a great fun board game can't translate to CD-ROM without being full of bugs and glitches (and that's from playing against the computer, not even counting internet play). Still, there are good things to say about the game: it's easier to play than the board version, there are many rules variations to make it almost infinitely challenging, map graphics are true to the original and the spirit of the game is in no way compromised, plus you don't have to do any of the laborious set-up chores and general minutiae of the board version.Hasbro has already put out one patch. Here's to hoping they can release another for this game."
2,Terrible Computer Translation of an Excellent Board Game,"Even after applying the latest patch for this game (there have been three of them so far), I still experience frustrating bugs while playing against the computer. I've gotten to the point now where I don't even use submarines because attacking with them will cause the game to crash almost 50% of the time. Overall, the game feels like it was rushed out the door about 6 months before it was truly finished, and I really have to wonder if Hasbro did any extensive play-testing of this product before it shipped. Trust me, if you buy this game, you will be dissapointed."
1,This game was a disappointment.,"Axis&Allies is a classic strategy board game. I eagerly awaited the computer version, but I was greatly disappointed. The AI computer opponents present little challenge to even the most casual player and the online gaming system is very buggy. So unless you have a friend to play locally, don't waste your money. On the good side, for playing a friend, the computer game takes away all the book-keeping that made the board version tedious at times."
4,pretty fun game,"I enjoy playing Axis and Allies. It is fairly true to the board game and although there are a few bugs (you may suddenly see hundreds of enemy forces on the board), using the time machine may clear those up. If anyone else happens to have the Iron Blitz edition, I found I was unable to load the game until I turn my computer's clock back to 1999, installed it, then reset the clock. Surely Hasbro didn't sell us a Y2K noncompliant game did they?"
2,Practice Only,"This game is for the novice only. If you are a pro at Axis and Allies, you will find this game predictable, and not challenging."
1,WARNING!!,This game does not work with Windows Crapa... I mean Windows Vista!! Even when you change the compatibility mode in the properties tab... NOTHING! DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE RUNNING VISTA!!!
1,Doesn't Play,The game wouldn't not play properly on my computer. Too many glitches too the point that it wasn't worth it. I had a copy of this a long time ago and it worked just fine. I don't know if this has to do with the manufacturer or what.
2,Not as good as it could be,"This is a great board game. I found the AI on the computer version to be very weak. I had to give the other side major bonuses, and pick the weakest country and give my self the poorest allies in order to get an even slightly challenging game out of it. The interface was also pretty weak, though the graphics were okay. Selecting and moving units around the board was the most cumbersome part of the game, especially with transports. Each time you want to move a group of transports and have them do the same thing, you have to handle each of them individually. There should have been a grouping function.Granted this is an older version, of the game. I would have probably not bought it if it was clear on the advertizement that this was for DirectX 5.0. That would have been a dead giveaway. All in all, it may be okay as a multiplayer interface for people to play real people on, but don't buy it to be challenged by the computer, you may as well be playing against a neophyte."
1,Price,"Who would pay $328 dollars for this in the first place??? I know the price is marked down now, but why in the world is the original price that high?!?!"
5,sacrifice remembered,This film causes one to think of what love of country means and what sacrifice was made for us by many military people like the Sullivans.
5,Fighting Sullivans,"This video is about the five Sullivan brothers that were all killed together during World War II. On November 13,1942 they were all serving aboard the USS Juneau, when a Japanese torpedo struck the ship and all five were lost along with 395 others. It's a documentary and a little different then the Hollywood movie version which is still one of my favorite old movies. It was worth watching and is in color and B&W."
1,True Story of the Fightng Sullivans,"Loved the movie when I saw it on TV, and thoughtthat was what I was purchasing here. This is adocumentary and not what I thought I was ordering.So now I have to purchase another DVD of theactual movie."
5,Leapster L-Max Princess Educational Game,My daughter has learned how to write her alphabets by using this game. We love it!
3,More fun than educational,"My 3 & 4 y.o. daughters love this cartridge, but the games are a little silly in my opinion. I'm not sure what the fireworks game is supposed to teach (fireworks explode wherever the pen is pointed). There are also two games that just play songs.There is a more educational game w/ Gus that teaches shapes, numerical order, etc. The magical footsteps also teach writing skills. I still expect more from Leapfrog, although my daughters do prefer the Princess games to the others. I would recommend the Dora cartridge if you're looking for more of an educational game. I'm glad I got this on sale-it's definitely not worth the retail price."
2,Not as good as other cartridges,"I bought this cartridge for my 5 year old and she has a very hard time seeing what you are supposed to be doing. The graphics are not very clear. She gets so frustrated that she prefers to play with the other games. Had I know what the graphics looked like, I would have never purchased it."
3,Good but others are better,"My daughter likes this game, but it lacks something that most of us are used to from leapfrog. The content is Poor compared to the other games out there, and my daughters attention is not held as long on this cartridge compared to others even though she is crazy about anything disney princess! I think they could have done alot better with this product, and If I had known the content of this game I would not have bought it, Just because there are other games that are better. If you are looking to purchase it for the learning aspect over the fun aspect try something else."
4,Cute game,"My 5yr old got the leapster for Christmas and loves this game. From my perspective it is a little young for her since she already knows all her shapes, letters and numbers but on the other hand she figured out how to play all the games quickly and can do them all by herself. She has several other leapster games that are more educational but she likes this one best because she doesn't need mommys help at all."
1,disapointed,I got a empty newly wraped box that did not have the game in the box. And a sad 3 year old. Plus lost $15 that I could of got her something else with.
1,Leapster,"Was VERY disappointed because had it shipped to granddaughter, and was told it did not fit the LeapsterExplorer; so sad"
3,Lowrider Jams 2,"This Cd has many different artist on it, if you like the alternative style of music than this is for you."
2,Forget the sleeping pills,"I was really excited when I ordered this book. Couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, this book moves along at such a slow pace that it took me months to finish it. I would read a couple of chapters and get bored, put it down for a few days, go back, read a couple of chapters (you get the idea). BTW if you buy this book, google the case to see how this book really should have ended. Note: The ending is not the authors fault as this case was solved years after the author wrote the book."
3,O.K.,Got this for my son for Halloween this year and I wish I hadn't. The mask was pretty bent when we got it and it never bent back in to shape. The ribs on the front ripped off when he was taken it off! It's a pretty cheaply made costume.
2,Unbelievably flimsy,My son put it on and not 5 minutes later the rib piece was coming off at the seam and pieces of the black cape had just fallen off. And he was not even being rough with it. Can't believe I had to pay even more than $10 for this. I could've MADE this at home more sturdy with black construction paper and duct tape!
3,So So,"The costume is ok, the fabric is quite thin and fragile, though. You need to treat it like silk, because any tense pulling and it'll tear instantly."
2,Rating of Dementor costume,"The mask was ridiculous, and was different than in the picture. The mouth was off center, it came folded and the eyes and mouth weren't cut properly. Plus it had an annoying chest piece, that looked like armer."
5,scotland in gorgeous HD,"One reviewer mentioned the repetition. This is probably true, but I barely noticed, as the footage is just amazing. The photography is probably the best I have come across, and I have many many dvds of Scotland. It is a gorgeous dvd. I found it fascinating. The price is fantastic for such a long dvd. I checked it out from our library, but am going to buy my own copy now. They covered most of my favorite places. This is a perfect trip through Scotland for those like myself, who want to 'revisit' the places they have visited in the past; or for those who can't go but want to 'armchair travel'."
3,The Bonnie Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond and Scotland,"This DVD set is a wonder for lovers of Scotland; however it could have been so much more if they would have used something more than aerial shots. Even if they could not get out in the country in the winter, they could have shown the effects and beauty of snow in the cities, much less not showing the sights you can see year round from roads and walking around the glens and lochs, cities and towns. You miss a massive amount of visual splendor and effects by only employing aerial shots.There is some mention of history, but again, much of interest could have been added, which also would have made a more fascinating trip to this magnificent country."
4,Enjoyable to behold.,We very much enjoyed this DVD.. I had been there and learned about the landscape even more. She was very informative.. Wished it was longer thought..
4,Required reading for all Boomers,"This book has essential info for anyone concerned with preventing degenerative conditions that have been accepted as a normal part of aging. It turns out you don't have to watch your body waste away, as most of these conditions are entirely preventable. I have looked at a number of books of this genre, but this one and ""Younger Next Year"" by Crowley and Lodge are by far the best."
4,Air filters-competitively priced and delivered,"Being a maintenance buff for our families 4 vehicles, I find Amazon a convenient and very cost-effective source for my Fram Automotive products. Besides being priced at competitive prices with leading retail outlets, delivery to my home is the icing on the cake for me. I prefer the Fram line of products (convenience), although regular oil & air & filter changes with any brand is the key to good auto health."
2,I have to agree with Andrew M.,"Webb has been one of my favorite songwriters Christian or not. He may still be the best in the Christian biz, but he has declined with every album (Aaron Sprinkle is up there, imo, but he has suffered the same problem since Moontraveler).I've heard nothing as poignant or driven as Center Aisle, nothing as creative and insightful as Bus Driver. I loved all his songs on 40 Acres. Table for Two, Somewhere North, Daylight Escape. What happened to that guy?She Must and Shall Go Free was not bad, but just a huge letdown from what i expected would be full of the same stuff that I loved when he was with Caedmon's.I guess it happens to most great writers. They simply lose their edge. They lose their ability to seek out truly honest and cutting material. I feel like Webb's agenda has clouded his good judgement. Why limit your material to a singular theme?Tis a sad year for songwriters. Elliot Smith dies and other muscial/lyrical geniuses have been coming up flat.*sigh*"
3,"Not Bad, with hints of greatnesss","Derek Webb is intriguing to me. I think he is a great musician, a fine singer and even better lyricist.This CD, is very good, and grows on me with each listen, but it just wasn't everything I hoped it to be. A few songs really grabbed me. The lyrics in T Shirts nailed the downfall of modern day, ""corporate Christianty"", and ""Better than Wine"", is a gorgeous love song!But, something on this album is lacking. When momentum begins to build, it suddenly stops and you have to find a new song to start all over again. That being said....you will still enjoy this album! Derek is a fresh voice in the world of Christian music that has grown dull, timid and formulaic.He writes with intelligence and courage. I love listening to what he has to say, almost more like an author. I truly believe, he is an elite artist who will move huge waves the rest of his career. Buy into Derek Webb...."
2,Does not fit for Nokia E61,"It is a nice looking case and I would've been very happy to use it with my phone, but it does not fit for Nokia E61. Thank God the seller was nice enough to take it back."
2,fun toy,"From the picture of the toy i thought this was brand new, i was mistaken. when i opened the package, it was a used one. No where in the description did it say it was new unless i just didn't see it. however, i am sure my son will love it when i give it to him for Christmas."
4,Spidey fan,"I got this for my 4 year old grandson. Although recommended age is 6, his pre-occupation with Spiderman keeps him occupied. I recommend Leapster products for all young pre schoolers. My grandaughter was very advanced when she started school thanks to Leapster."
5,Great game,My son has been a spiderman nut now for over five years so this game is one he really enjoys.It's not challenging enough though for the grade suggested on the packaging. He is almost through the levels and has only had it since the New Year. He also wishes it had math since that is his favorite subject.
2,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON,Not what I thought it would be..once you open up the doors that are unlock that is it game over..not hard to do..the only thing I can say if you can not spell well it might be ok if you can spell really well I would not buy this game.
3,Boring!!!!!,I would have to say that this game was a bit of a let down for my two grandsons. They want to play more games than this had to offer. It appeared that all this game really had to offer was reading comic book passages and then it had the child identify the word in the passage that was either mis-spelled or pronounced improperly. Not too gratifying to 5 year olds. I would be very interested in other peoples opinions as perhaps we were missing out on something else the game had to offer. We thought that it had other games on it but were unable to get to anything else.
4,For every spiderman fan,"I bought this for my 5 year old, and he loves it. His favorite part, is finding the passwords, so that we can get on [...]and get a surprise. This is a little harder to follow than some of the other leapster games, but still overall a great product."
1,Terrible,Backbone Man is one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life. Like nails on a chalkboard. Did not listen to any other songs after that atrocity.
5,Absolutely the Best For Cleaning House!! Amazon has it going on!!,"I bought this for one song, and have ended up loving them all!! Believe it or not, this is Great music for watering the plants and cleaning house. Just like the title says! It will get you moving with it's nice swagger with out having you hyper-ventilate...The music is deep and soulful, the lyrics, fun and playful. This is music for the daytime. I would not put this on for romance, but definitely when the romance is over and you still want to keep it fun.I would not hesitate to reccommend this to anyone who likes a little blues with all their fun."
3,"Good information, not much detail","The content is excellent, respectful toward men and women, but the writing style drove me crazy (lots of repetition, odd grammar, unclear sentences), and he didn't go into much detail as to how to adopt the changes he suggests.I can recommend it as an introduction to men who truly have no clue at all as to how to behave around women, but don't expect it to do anything but point you in the right direction, because it lacks implementation excercises."
2,"Good message, bad instruction","The author has a good message but he doesn't instruct the reader sufficiently to apply his advice. He describes the ideal man but doesn't give enough details on how to become that man.I think the book is decent, but it will be disappointing if you expect instructions on how to be a better man. Instead of instructions on how to be a better man, the author gives you a description of a better man."
2,How to be Weak and Get Taken Advantage Of,"Contrary to what my impressions of the book were when reading the description, this book is not about how to pick up on, seduce, or otherwise attract women. Major themes of this book include waiting around for a woman to be attracted to you and magically knowing when she does, not approaching women unless you get this feeling, and constant examples of the author's perceptions of the types of men in the world. Although the stories presented about these types are funny at times, they serve no purpose other to make the book longer than it really is. The author wants all men to find the woman of their dreams and be happy, which he claims he has done. That's not to say that all men don't eventually want this. It just seems at times the author wrote this book in order to impress his wife than actually help all men."
3,A good start to understanding the game,"This book does give good insights into yourself as either a player or nice guy, and tries to give an understanding of 'the game'. What it will not do is tell you how to get women. I recommend this book as a starter book. It is a very quick read (around an hour). If you really are interested in understanding how to get women, and understanding people in general, I recommend The Art of Seduction."
4,Excellent book for starting your transformation,"I enjoyed this book as it was an easy read. It is a meat and potatos book; there's no fat. If you're where I was a few months ago, your have resorted to looking for a book (of all things) that can help you with woman. No doubt you finally got burned so bad that it chnaged your direction in life and you are now a student looking for a teacher. I'd recomend you start here with Rom's book. Read through it and if you find it a painfull eye opener then GOOD because that is a sign that you are open to change and are on your way. Congratulate your self for finally starting this journey that in 12-18 months will produce a whole new you. After you have read Rom's book. Purchase and read all of the books by R. Don Steele. Their titles are a bit much and they are strongly worded but, for the most part, I found them factual and, again, a painfull read for me. Have fun on you new journey!"
4,great for starters,"This is easy read book for total novices, he basically sums it up in the introduction about the key is keeping a ""balance"" meaning dont be too nice or too much of a jerk.He clears up alot of other commons sense things such as confidence, style and other traits that women find sexy. When you read this you want to beat yourself in the face and go "" why didnt I realize this before""So for the stumbling nieve nice guy or any man wanting to brush up on figuring out women I would recomend this book."
1,Large Print,Covers the basics in large print and simple language.There are much better books on the market.I wasted my money on this one.
4,Nice Guys don't have to finish last anymore,"This is a terrific book. I'd like to buy a few hundred copies and give them out to every guy I run into who is having problems meeting women and asks me for advice. Most of them are Nice Guys and they can't under stand why they can't get any play. It's short, well-written and to the point."
2,Not worth your time/ $,"I was very disappointed with this book. It seemed to me that the ""author"" quickly wrote this book to make some quick cash (he obviously has had some success, as he duped me into buying it). There is not much here, besides the same kind of information you can get from other, more informed books (like ""How to Succeed With Women,"" which I highly recommend). Save your money, fellas."
4,A How To Be A Man Primer,"I really enjoyed this book and got much from it when I was younger. It's definitely not a How To Pick Up Women book. It's more of a guide to become a mature man and in doing so become more attractive to women. The basic principle is that a woman chooses her man. I think this translates to mean that a man should not emasculate himself or resort to conning in attempt to win a woman over, and has to be willing to move on if he isn't getting signals to keep advancing. This is basic fare, but it is something that needs to be remembered--and this is a little book that gets it's point across in an enjoyable way."
5,Are you man enough?,"This is an excellent book, concise, quick to read and straight to the point. No fluff or cheap tactics here. Ron Wills opened my eyes on some things, reinforced and clarified others. This is easily the best book I've read on the subject and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking how to attract the woman you really want. Being a former ""nice guy"" who couldn't get the time of day from anyone that interested me, I look forward to using the knowledge I gained from this book. If you're looking for real, honest to God help and guidance on being the man women dream about, this book will really help you."
2,SMALL!!! TINY SMALL!!,"When ordering, I didn't realize how small this is. I cannot see my whole face in it, no matter what. If I had a back seat, then, maybe I could from there. I don't, though. Although I've used the light a few times instead of turning on the overhead light, it doesn't really illuminate my face enough to use the mirror. Just enough to find my phone in the dark so that the screen gives me a brighter light.It's pretty thick, as well. It would not clip onto the hinge side of the visor in my CRX. Instead, it clips on the outside edge so that, when the visor is straight down, the mirror is on the end near the floor, not the ceiling. I find myself, still, turning the rear view toward me instead of using this tiny visor mirror. Not very good."
2,just ok,"The quality is ok, but it did not fit the visor on my 2011 Chevy Cruze :( Also, the light could be a bit brighter,seems dim for a lighted mirror."
2,Ehhhh...,"Doesn't fit my visor. Can't use it for what it was made for. Kind of a waste of money. And watch out for the metal clips - those things will scratch you like crazy! Worse than a paper cut, that's for sure!"
4,Fits my Honda Fit :),I bought this for the passenger side of my Honda Fit (Echo) as I sometimes find myself being chauffeur driven :). I was glad when I found this on Amazon as it comes in very handy. Only drawback is there doesn't seem to be a way (as far as I can see) to turn of the side lights which aren't necessary when being used during the day.
5,Just right!,I just got mine today for my Camry. It fits perfectly and does just what it's suppose to do.
2,Great performances but............,"Well, the previous review has it right that these are great performances by Robert Palmer and his ace band, but the sound quality is simply awful and almost unlistenable to me (although I am an audio quality snob). It sounds like the recording was made on a cheap tape recorder from out in the audience and Robert himself sounds like he is singing into a tin can. It sounds like an old bootleg recording from the 70s. Bear in mind, I have been a huge Robert Palmer fan since Sneakin' Sally and can still bop around my living room when that tune is on - I just can't help it. But this release is disappointing. The studio tracks are pretty well recorded and aren't bad - but this one is only for real diehards and those who want to complete a collection."
1,"Sorry I wasted my money, even if it was required.","If you are attempting to truly learn how to apply statistics to your data, please do not waste your time with this book. Pay the money for an actual statistics book written by a statistician and save yourself time, frustration and the money you would spend buying another stats book anyway after you became too frustrated with this book. It is poorly written, difficult to follow and riddled with mathematical errors. Additionally, she provides long descriptions of how to execute sample questions with MSTAT, but no explanation of how to complete a sample problem by hand, and little detail on the explanation of your output in the software means. Example problems do not have to be anthropological to understand how they apply to our field, they just have to be well written. Just save your money, and buy something else."
3,"victory records' version of My Chemical Romance, nothin' new","songs bout death, blood, dying, killing...west coast version of MCR...a few ok songs but the lyrical content sounds redundant a few times...""Nightmare"" is said in pretty much every song...i bought a used promo copy...i suggest the Victory records dvd ""Mosh"" because its $8, cd & dvd...24 music videos, 21 songs on the cd...pretty good at a great price"
1,I wish 0 stars was a possibility!,O man... was I disapointed or what! I wish I could have chosen 0 stars as a rating because these guys are just THAT BAD! Please do not buy this album... it is NOT worth your time.
1,What the hell?,Total My Chemical Romance knock off band. These guys are almost as bad as Atreyu... I'm serious. Get an AFI or T.S.O.L. or a Misfits album or something... Not this!
3,Have pity upon those of such low intellect...,"I don't particularly have feelings leaning one way or another towards this band. Yes, they sound like My Chemical Ramance... kind of. Yes, they try to pull of the whole goth/punk/emo rock look. Who cares...? The music I'll admit is catchy but a little too repetitive. I just find it to be a bit humorous how other people can give such a straight forward review, and be such total idiots at the same time. I mean, who in the world is ""Tommy Brummel""? I sure as heck have never heard of him. Tony, yes, but ""Tommy""? Most certainly not. I just can't take a review seriously if it has misconstrued major facts. That being just one. And write in a manner consistent with that of an elementary age student. Or maybe the point was to be a joke. Nevertheless, this band doesn't do much to stand out from the crowd. Of course, in this day and age, that could be considered musical suicide. I mean, who wants to hear something new? Only me..."
1,I wish zero stars was an option,"Victory Records used to put out Warzone and Integrity albums. Let than sink in for a minute before you read on.I was going to write a really long long long hateful/hilarious review, but then I just realized that this band is so godawful that they're not even worthy of the minimal energy and motor skills needed to tap my fingers angrily at my keyboard in an attempt to write a review.People who spend actual legal United States currency on this CD should be arrested.For fans of: Emo boyz, stars, dudes in size zero pants, Livejournals, dudes in makeup, pretending to know about photography, dudes in size zero pants AND makeup, fat girls with pink hair, hawt boyz wit tattooz n (sic) piercingz, tYpInG LyKe ThIs, cutting yourself."
2,Aiden ~Nightmare Anatomy~,"Aiden's second full length album, their first for Victory Records, travels down a pretty worn out path. Aiden takes the up-tempo punk sound of AFI and early Thrice and adds a vocalist who sounds like a more punk version of the singer from Avenged Sevenfold. The problem with all of these comparisons is the following; the band isn't as moody as AFI, as brooding or dark as Thrice or as rock as Avenged Sevenfold, they fall short on every front. In fact, their vocalist pretty much falls flat all over the album. He just about kills the feel of every song on this disc due to his inability to emote any feelings because of his lack of range. The music, while not original, could be saved by a marginal vocalist. Too bad they don't have one.For Fans of: AFI, Thrice and My Chemical Romance"
3,okay,"i bought this album and i think i expected more from it. overall it is okay. although your first impression is that the band is totally talentless, listen to it a few times and pay attention to the lyrics, and you might like it a little more. just do it so it doesn't feel like a total waste of money."
1,Are you kidding me!?!?,"This band is such cliched eyelyner emo garbage I don't know where to even start...First of all they sound like a cheap second rate imitation of my chemical romance. MCR are not my cup of tea to begin with but they at least know how to somewhat write songs and sound good for what they are. If you are into that sort of thing go for the real source. I cant wait for this emo, eyeliner fad to be over with, it's wasting valuable space and air for real bands. If you want to hear something real, I suggest checking out Drive Like Jehu the self titled album, or anything by the Damned, Christ on a crutch or even Garden Variety ""knocking on the skill level"" which to me is true Emo."
1,Prepackaged for this generation of mallrats,"To be honest I hated this band before I even heard their album. It seems like every rag I read, these posers had their mascara caked faces plastered on every other full page ad that those shameless con artists at Victory whored out.Just for sh%ts and giggles I decided to preview some of the tracks and it was exactly what I expected. Souless, heartless, glossy shlock. Which equates to a ton of records being sold to eyeliner wearing 16 year old boys and their girlfriends who outweigh them by 20 pounds.Pathetic."
1,WOW!,"I picked up this CD because this is a local NW band. WOW! was the first thing I said after about 20 minutes of this garbage album. I just couldent believe that people like this band. Although I wasn't expecting a master piece.... I mean you have to keep in mind that it is goth/punk/pop/screamo music, obviously the musicians in these bands are not going to be the most talented...but they can make some fun noise. However, this band was just awful. Don't take my word for it, if you want to save yourself some money, go to their myspace account and listen to one of their crappy songs. You will hear what I mean. But of course if you are a 16-year-old high school girl who doesn't know anything, you'll probably view this band as your God. As many of our misguided teens have. Listen to this music and turn it off and really be honest with yourself, think objectively...yeah...its trash. I agree with the guy above me, I am disappointed. I don't like that these guys are representing my hometown."
4,The music would be 4 1/2 but the singing brings them down,"The music is very good and catchy with nice melodies. The one thing holding this band back is the singer, he looks really goth and all but he should maybe pay a bit more attaention to his voice than his looks and make-up. His voice is shaky and he doesn't hit the notes too well, it's ok but he could definitely improve. The muicality overall is good but the one thing i'd say (but maybe i haven't listened to it closely enough yet) is that all songs sound the same.Please don't rate this as unhelpful I just don't have anything to say more about this band I just laid down my points."
1,Destroying Seattle's Fine Reputation,"This band is awful... The They are naive ""musicians"" who are stuck in the hackneyed genre of punk/emo/screamo. A few days ago I went a 30 Seconds to Mars Concert, and opening for 30 Seconds to Mars were a number of other bands, one of them being Aiden. I was very excited to see how this band was, because most of the people around me were praising the band, making them even more alluring. Soon enough I was privy to the exalted band that was Aiden, but they certainly were not all they had been built up to be. Constant, blaring power chords, off-key screaming and ""singing,"" and constant cursing seemed to be what this band was all about. Their songs were terrible, and the band got off time on many occasions. Aiden is just another typical screamo band that is ONLY out there to make money. Sorry for anyone who adores this band, but this is NOT music... Pick up a guitar and take lessons for three months and you could be in this band."
4,Nightmare Anatomy....4 1/2 stars,"I bought Nightmare Anatomy by Aiden after hearing their song 'The Last Sunrise.' I had no idea who the band was but after hearing that song that I couldn't get out of my head I decided to purchase their CD and I couldn't be more happy. Usually on an album you get maybe 3-5 good songs, every song on this CD is a hit! Every song is wonderfully composed and the lead singer, (Will? Is that his name?) sings with alot of passion. Aiden's music sounds like My Chemical Romance (which I'm a HUGE fan of) and AFI mixed together. I highly recommend his CD to fans of rock/punk rock/gothic music."
4,Interesting Screamo Band,"These guys are not polished and the recording has been worked on by sound crew etc. But, the music rocks, the look is cheesy yet cool, and the vocals are in par with other scremo/emo bands out there. I think these guys are refreshing goth, punk, horror, emo! I like the album. Need to see them live to see how in the raw they are."
1,What a dissapointment...,"I first heard the song Knife Blood Nightmare on a Victory Records sampler, and I was hooked. I had this song on repeat. Constantly. The next song I heard was Goodbye We're Falling Fast. I heard a rough mix, and still, I thought it was great. I bought this cd this morning, popped it in, and was utterly disappointed. Even the two songs I was hooked on before sounded terrible on here. There wasn't a redeeming moment here."
3,DIVERSIFY,"I gave Long John a listen. Interesting, but there seems to be a little something missing. He just didn't do it for me. Maybe, I'll try again later."
4,"Works well with Visions, better than Vision E","Having being a fan of the Vision string set, I had always been worried about the Vision e string. It did not match the set for brilliancy and strength. On my violin it (the vision e) lacked some response and did not resonate as well. So I thought to replace it with a Jargar forte e, however those being hard to find, I searched through my e-string bags and found a Tonica e. I figured I'd try it to see if there is an improvement to the Vision e, not expecting anything. However once I strung up my violin, I could hear the ringing sound and confirmed that it had more depth and presence as well as better response. The rest of the set is Vision, and matches very well with this Tonica e."
1,DONT BUY THIS FROM ABC WHOLESALE,Don't buy from them they will sell you the wrong product and then not give you a refund even though there store page says they do!!!! Order from CosmeticMall or somewhere else instead!!!!
5,Awesome product...a must buy,"Well, I'm of several races so I have wavy, curly, dry frizzy hair....I wash it and it looks and feels like straw. Even when the ends are trimmed it doesn't look healthy. I have tried every single hair product out there, including Garnier which I thought was the best...I had always shied away from Nexxus because of the prices, but then I gave in and decided to give it a shot. I bought this along with the shampoo and leave-in conditioner.......Now my curls are soft, shiny and healthy looking and it smells really good too...even when I blow dry my hair, it stays nice and soft and I don't get the fly away effect...so no more straw hair for me! I now swear by this product and this is the only one I'll use on my hair. Definitely recommend for anyone that has dry, frizzy, untamed hair. It's worth the money if you are as frustrated as I was with all the products out that that promised healthy shiny hair after two weeks...all bull! Nexxus all the way!!"
5,Really Strengthen your hair,"First it's essential to say that we cannot expect any hair product to give us a miracle or something. So, the same is true about this one! However it helped my hair to be a little bit stronger and look healthier."
3,Wrong Ingredients,"After reading multiple reviews, I carefully selected the product with the Keritin as a highter ingredient (about the seventh) but the bottle came with Keritin way down on the list. Also, the bottles seemed to be filled at a second-market facility because they were overfilled and the neck of the bottle was not clean which made me think they had been re-used or re-filled somehow. I really hope the results for the product itself are not disappointing."
4,4 1/2 star,"this was good but not good enough for it's time frame. it's an older book but serves its purpose just fine under a 4 star flag. the small writting might be hard on some that need a decent size text. It's no too small, it is under normal sized text. But to expect to get so much from one book without slightly smaller text size? It's about cargo pocket size. hardly small enough to fit in most pockets. it's no mini. but it's travel size (on the big end). I like having books around over ereaders. becouse my eyes can get sensitive on learning and reading monitors instead of books."
1,Missing pages,"My dictionary arrived in good shape. I didn't use it until last night and found that there are 80 pages missing in the English section. I wouldn't be concerned, but I use this dictionary to tutor students for French projects and oral proficiency exams. I would like it replaced if possible."
3,English-French Dictionary,"Arrived promptly and intact. Clearly a ""mature"" book with slightly yellowed pages. Gives me the air of one who's spent years translating English to French!"
3,Be careful if you have a Shoreland'r Trailer,"I recently ordered this to replace a broken driver's (left) side light on a 2004 Shoreland'r trailer. The light arrived and I found that while it is marked as being ""Left-Driver Side"", it is actually the light for the passenger's or right side. Whether it is incorrectly marked or Shoreland'r puts their mounting brackets on the opposite way, this was not the driver's side light on my trailer. This light has the curve on the left side, which makes it fit the right side of trailer. You can't go by the pictures of the two products on the webpage since both lights show the curved side on the left. So if you have a Shoreland'r trailer, make sure you check to see if the curve on your bracket is on the right (driver's or left side) or left (passenger's or right side). It could save you having a spare light laying around the house."
3,A nostalgic look at handloading 75 years ago,"This book is very interesting as it covers all aspects of handloading at time when the golden age of hunting and shooting was at its peak. Some of America's greatest gun writers, hunters, and ""characters"" were making their mark at this time. Handloading has enjoyed a tremendous growth in this field and today we have this pioneer's to thank. JR Mattern was one of them. He was the first ""Phil Sharpe"" and was very instrumental in introducing the American Public to the art of Handloading. He was not the first but with his plain easy to understand writing and overall knowledge of his craft American shooters become proficient handloaders themselves and in doing so led the way for American industry to further develop the products that we use today. This book is extremely well written and even though it is outdated, the insight this book provides is well worth the price. This book belongs in any serious handloaders library."
1,Investigative reading,"I ordered this book because I am a Bible teacher and one of my students had asked me about the credibility of this writing.I had heard it mentioned but had no personal knowledge of it.Upon examining the book,I cannot say it is not valid,but I can say that it does not have the anointed command that the recognized Holy Scriptures have.I am glad to be able to express a personal impression to any future question concerning this."
2,"Not great, not terrible","This book isn't bad for a transliteration (a comprehensive one at that), but if you are looking for something more scholarly, I reccommend a book discussing this one, not the book itself (as it is horribly translated from the original text...but what can you say about a book that was never meant to be in the bible in the first place? ..or maybe it was!?)."
1,"Purchased, but no book received yet...",If I actually got the book I would be able to review it.... still waiting though.
3,Enoch in Wonderland,"I'm sure Enoch didn't write this book because he didn't smoke hash. It's a mishmash of sayings from ancient scribes who evidently asked and answered their own questions. It belongs with those other esteemed tomes such as ""The Urantia Book"" and ""A Course in Miracles."""
1,Disappointed,I dislike the way this book is written. It is written in one sentence chapters. The author never expounds on the thoughts which Enoch was trying to portray. I wish I had made a different choice.
4,Enlightening,"Sheds some very interesting light on Old Testament narratives, especially what really prompted God to allow the flood recorded in Genesis chapter 6."
2,Not a good one as it has a lot less detailed information than some ohter versions eg. info on fallen angels,"a lot of information on fallen angels names are missing, compared to some other versions of the text. i assume later translations need to be looked at again eg. ethiopian coptic texts"
4,Easy to Read,"Well written, with transliterations, this book is easy to read, and faithful to the original text."
5,Great Translation,"What a helpful book and a great translation from an author who has done his homework. If you are interested in all things biblical, history, etc., this is a great book to buy. Well worth the money and the read."
5,"The three books of Enoch, the prophet","This is a MUST read book that NOBODY likes because it has something in it that goes against ALL conventional religions ! So of course it is much maligned by them . EVEN though the Creator condemns those that do that . This is a book that requires spiritual understanding , and will put the fear of GOD into anyone that does . Henry A."
5,A truly beautiful and fascinating book,"The Lost Book of Enoch is titled 1 Enoch in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible, and officially part of their Old Testament canon. It is within 1 Enoch that a very clear and accurate vision and prophecy of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ exists. 1 Enoch show us the Sons of God (i.e. Angels) and how they fell and waged war with God's faithful angels. Mr. Lumpkin's transaltion is fresh and elegant. The translation was so smooth and easy to read that I read 1 Enoch straight through in one sitting. I highly recommend getting 1 Enoch or The Lost Book of Enoch that contains the visions and prophecies of the first of three (3) humans that were translated and assumed into heaven, the other two being Elijah and the Virgin Mary, and who will come again before the end of the world, with Elijah, proclaiming repentance and turning away from the Antichrist. I loved this book, and I know you will love it as well."
5,References a plus,"This book is nicely done. The print on it is darker then normal, but I'm guessing the author did it to clearly seperate the references from the actual book. The darker print is the actual Book Of Enoch. The lighter print are the references to other known bible verses. It's nice that he has the references written out so I don't have to keep opening my bible and flipping through to look up the references. ( I can get lazy). For example, one reference is from Revelations 21:10-11. He not only gave the reference address but also wrote out the whole verse. cool."
4,German oratorio and Danish cantata,"This CD in the CPO label's ongoing rediscovery of Telemann's vocal music includes two 30 minute pieces: The first is a Resurrection oratorio (Die Auferstehung TWV6:7) from 1761 and the second a real rarity commissioned from Telemann by the Kingdom of Denmark in 1757 to a Danish text with a Latin coda (De Danske, Norske og Tydske Underssates Glaede TWV12:10). It has to be said that the cantata is a bit of a novelty, and one detects that Telemann found his lack of Danish inhibited any word painting, but it is still quality Telemann, and the German oratorio is truly lovely in its own right.As usual with CPO presentation is excellent, and includes both texts in German, Danish/Latin and English translations."
5,Perfect for Hardibacker,"I was laying over 3000 sq ft of hardibacker. It seemed a perfect job for an autofeed screwdriver. I bought a SENCO because my local store was out of the Makita. The SENCO couldn't sink the screws through the Hardibacker. I went to the local rental shop and got a professional version of the SENCO. It was better, but I still had to finish off setting every screw. Finally, I found this Makita. It handled the job perfectly."
2,Bad AI ruins this game,"This game could have been great. All the tracks are fantastic, the graphics are great, the cockpit view is superb. So why only 2 stars? The computers AI is horrible. The cars take 1 or 2 paths around the track and rarely pass. Sounds realistic, right? Well, if the car in front stops, then all the cars will stop. Literally. Stop, dead in the track. I passed 22 cars at once because they were stopped going into 1st turn, backed up all the way down the straight. Also, there are no crashes, you just sort of bump off your opponent, bump off the wall. If you hit the grass, your speed instantly drops to 40 mph, no matter how fast you're going. You never spin out. This game could have been great, but the unrealistic (lack of) racing on the computer's part coupled with the silly physics of no crashes and no spinouts ruins this title for me. It is good for a rent, but I'd recommend not buying it."
3,Wanting,"I believe this is a perfect example of first stage graphics for Dreamcast. Play for fun, it reminds me of the old school Atari games."
3,Okay book,I used this book for class. I thought this book was good but it kind of rambled at times. Very informative though. Good source of info for people embarking on e-commerce.
3,A pleasant read.,"The world is full of Mrs Murphy's - women whose husbands have left them far behind in the acquisition of money. The main characters in this novel are quite likeable, the husband gets into awful trouble through trying to get a contract to make a spy mechanism for bosses to watch workers. The cleaner, Mae, is the best character of the lot, cheerful and energetic and who is the sole bread winner for the family. I found myself being quite indignant on her behalf.The plot was a little messy, especially toward the end, but overall a pleasant read."
4,Mrs. Murphy hires a cleaner,"As before I really enjoyed this book it was fun to read ,a bit lighter than my usual read but thoroughly enjoyableI shall certainly look out for more books by Kath Kincaid"
3,Lonely housewife's woes,"Mrs Murphy is a lonely housewife whom 2 grownup children left home and a husband that too busy to give her enough attention. She spent most of the daytime alone in a over-sized house and loads of house chores..Her boring life leaped into a dramatic change when she hires a new cleaner Mae.Her house,her marriage and her life are no longer the same."
2,Some parts were suspenceful - but that's about it!,"I would admit, some parts of this film were scary, but not much else. Aside from being partially scary, it is also offensive, distasteful and full of inappropriate scenes like the part where Mr. Montelli is feating his wife and kids, or when Sonny is engaging in a sexual experience with his sister. I must say-it had a good ending, but the rest was blugh!"
4,Stands out in a group of crappy sequels,"This movie is surprisingly good. This movie does do the supernatural thing as the first one did, however, this one gives a bit more insight as to the actual DeFeo story which has been so unbelievably exploited."
4,Sadly Underrated Creepfest,"Despite its many detractors, ""Amityville II"" is not your typical bargain basement horror flick. For starters, the movie makes no claims it is ""based on a true story"", it only suggests the events of the 1975 DeFeo murders, so this should not be viewed as a documentary. The movie is filled with evocative imagery: tilting camerawork, POV shots, and the house itself is shot to guarantee maximum creepiness. The scene where the family is murdered will forever be etched in my memory; it is gruesome, disturbing and unforgettable in its raw intensity. Isn't that the hope of any good horror movie? The theme music by Lalo Shifrin (returning from the first film) remains spine tingling, even today, and the film as a whole puts today's horror flicks (including the dreary remake of the original), in which the emphasis is on quik cuts and flashiness than atmosphere and suspense, to shame. You want a good fright? Watch this film."
1,One of the Worst,"I have a certain fondness for bad movies--I love all Ed Wood movies-- but this one is even worse than ""Plan 9"". The way that the sensitive subject of incest is handled is quite tasteless and exploitive. It's truly amazing how BAD this movie is...(I almost feel like seeing it again)."
2,Stick with the original!,"After seeing the first Amityville movie, this one was a bit dissapointing. This movie was about as scary as buttered toast! The father of the family was as obnoxious as they come. I couldn't wait to see him get toasted! As for the kids seeing paintbrushes float in mid air and paint on the walls, they should have been scarred for life. Then there's the incest! Ah yes! The sister didn't seem to think anything strange of her brother's sudden and strange desire. I think I'll skip the 3rd installment!"
4,It was alright as horror goes.,It was good for when it was made. It's a good break from the horror slasher flix of today. It has a good theme but need to work on film. It a must see and maybe a great cult classic one day but not big on critics list of great horror films. Again it's a good break from the slasher and a must for horror collectors.
3,creepy,i liked this movie the best out of the 3. the music really sets off this film. burt young played a good part as the mean father i did not care much for the part where sonny has sex with his sister they could have left that out. all in all this is a pretty good sacary film you wont be let down
4,A'ville II ...,"While not as good as the original, The Possession provides as an interesting sequel.The acting is above average and the SFX, what little of it there is, is decent.It's worth a look for devoted fans of the first movie, and folks just wanting to see casual ghost movie/horror stuff.3.5* - 4*"
1,Amityville: The Beginning....,"I didn't like that they didn't use the same name as the original Ronald DeFeo, instead is was Sonny something. I didn't like the way he killed his family because they were supposed to be asleep, but they were awake. Also, the brother wants to gang-bang his sister! This is a bad prequel, and I would NOT recommend this movie!!!"
3,Creey as hell,"I have to admit I have not yet seen the whole of this movie, since I've only seen it on television. However, I have to admit that this movie creeped me out a *whole* lot more than the first one did. In several parts of this movie, it builds up suspense. Plus, watching the evil target the oldest sent shivers up my spine. I recommend suspending your disbelief with this movie, whether you believe in supernatural or not. If you do, you can enjoy it a lot more.Also, don't expect too much of it. It's a prequel made off of what has turned into a very controversial subject. So many people claim its a hoax, yet others claim that the hoax idea is a rumor. I personally don't know what to believe. But I do know I enjoy this movie much more than the boring Amityville Horror."
3,One Scary Movie In More Ways Than One,"I've seen all of the Amityville movies that have come out on either VHS or DVD,but this particular movie is by far the best one from the series. Mostly because of the interesting characters in it. The best part in this movie was the ""close"" relationship between the brother and sister. It was shocking to say the least. Still,the only faults that this movie has are the special effects. Other than that,""Amityville II:The Possession"" stands out as a surprisingly good horror movie."
4,As Creepy and Disgusting as the First.,"Amityville II which I am sure takes away more from actual events, is just as Creepy and Disgusting as the First, and this Time no James Brolin!(of course and thank God!) Burt Young(convoy) is the dad, I recommend this movie to anyone, but not to watch at Night!"
2,"Yup. Pretty bad, alright....","After watching this movie, I went down my personal checklist of what I believe makes a movie great and this film only met two of my stringent requirements: 1) A guy gets his hot younger sister naked and makes out with her, and 2) Cutesy little children get blown away by a shotgun.Beyond that, it was duller than a...really dull thing. The acting is horrible by everyone (the furniture had more personality than the actors); the scares are seriously non-existent; there's no gore; it ends in an unbelievably obvious plagiarism of The Exorcist, etc. etc....Bad, bad, bad. At least the first movie had name actors and was somewhat creepy on occasion. This is the product of some board meeting that looked at the clock, saw it was 4:59, and needed an idea by the end of the day."
2,Avert your eyes,"Although it's called Amityville II this dreadful little movie is supposed to be a prequel about the first family to move into the cursed house. Unlike the Lutz's as played by James Brolin and Margot Kidder this family has nothing going for it. The father is a lout who smacks the kids around. The mother is a passive aggressive weeper and their oldest kid, Sonny is simmering with rage. In other words, these unpleasant people really don't need a demon they're doing a pretty good job of spreading the misery around by themselves. By the time Sonny turns green and starts shooting the family you're really, really ready for him to get on with it so this wretched flick can finally end.Bottom line: it's nowhere near as good or as fun as the original and as other reviewers have pointed out, it's mostly a rip off of the Exorcist."
3,The Possession......,"Having rathered part one and the recent remake, I rate Amityville- The Possession 3 stars. We have another family move into the famous haunted house. Again, many strange things begin to happen and eventually, the son in the family becomes ""possessed"". I do find this movie a bit scarier than part 1 only because of the scenes of the son being possessed..... those eyes and deep voice remind me of The Exorcist! so those scenes were not my favorite although that's what makes this sequel different and scarier. But overall, not a disappointment. Good movie."
3,"Good film, but quite disrespectful","The film was quite good, scary and suspensful. It sent shivers up my spine to think that this ""really happened"", however, that is my point. For those who don't know, this film is based loosely on the DeFeo murders in 1974. However, this film practically makes fun of it. It makes the family look like a bunch of dysfunctional louts. I figure if you were going to make a movie about a tragic event, you would at least have a little respect for the victims. All that aside, the movie is definately worth a look, simply because it IS creepy."
3,strange,"i have to say,this movie is much scarier than the first.but....kind of hard to follow.really gory.i liked this because it was very different than many horror films.in most,all the children live,in this one 2 or 3 kids die.i said ""dang!""definetely rent before buy"
5,Just a treat,"For a native San Franciscian, this was a thrilling read. I was shocked on what I learned and it is interesting to see how things change. Strongly recommended."
5,Best I ever bought,"I bought this album based on two songs that I heard on cable, so happy I did ! I can put it on and listen happily to the whole cd instead of copying just a few cuts on tape to hear as I've done with all the other music I've bought. It's really all great."
1,not worth the money,this costume is not worth the price. it is not even close to that puffy. you have to buy a petticoat if you want it to look like the picture. that's another $20 bucks. you would think for the price the dress would come with the petticoat to look like the picture. i think the dress is actually ugly when you look at it up close. i would not recommend this. trust me you'll regret buying it.
2,Don't sink the boat,"This was a quick weekend read that is basically a diary of a family's good and bad experiences owning a boat over several years. More a recant of experiences than it was a story, but I found it enjoyable."
5,Phenomenally strong female voice,Ann Rabson deserves every blues award she's received including the ultimate W.C. Handy. I love her vocal power and she's spellbinding live! I highly recommend this album to any and all blues lovers.
2,Very difficult to play,"Out of all the games my son has (around 10), this is the worst of them. It is confusing and very difficult to use. The activities seem interesting but when you try to do something, the controls just dont work well. I tried the activities so I could explain my son how to play (first time I have to do that with a leapster game) and couldnt finish them !!. Do not recommend this game."
2,More Games Please........We're Getting Bored!,"My five-year-old son's ""Leapster"" is his favorite! He absolutely loves the ""games"" that are for his age group. My gripe is that 5 years - 8 years is a long stretch....Children can get discouraged easily and lose interest if the material is too far above their heads. It makes them feel inadequate, and it isn't fun anymore! Not for Mom and Dad, either!Since the ""Leapster"" is such an expensive investment...I would have expected the co. to have a wider variety of products/games available by now. (With possibly two to three-year margins on the packages). We have collected all the ones appropriate for five year olds....and we're getting bored.Please, bring out some new and interesting and fun learning games asap!!! For all ages~~~"
2,To Young,"I bought this for my grandson not realizing that it was for an older child. So, it is not that there is anything wrong with the game it is just that he is to young for it."
5,I love it- review from 6 yr,"It is great. I like the Mrs Incredible game best. Because she spells words with me. The opening credits are neat too.review from Emma. age 6From her mom-I have been amazed at how well she has done with this game, since it has a 2nd and 3rd grade level on it. I was concerned it would be too advanced and not be fun for her. Instead, she has been challenged but in a fun and positive way. This is great game for encouraging Spelling, Reading, and Math!"
4,My son loves it,"I bought my kids Leapsters on an impulse in December just before a long plane trip. They loved them and it kept them entertained the whole time in the airport and on the plane. I got headphones and they fit in the case. I bought the Incredibles game for my son and he really likes it. He is in 2nd grade. My only complaint is that some of the games require that he use cards he has accrued by earning points, but we cannot figure out how this works. And the instruction manual did not explain it. I haven't been able to gauge how much he is learning but it sure keeps them entertained in a more educational way than other electronic games! I also hope they come out with more cartridges for older kids."
5,"Entertaining, instructive and disturbing","Leave it to the Italians. From thence comes a novel combining philosophical depth with a light and attractive humor. This story will grip you and draw you inside. Whether you are Joe, the race track tout or Herr Doktor Jaspers, the town phenomenologist, this butt naked look at the human condition will enthrall you. ""The toy is broken"" says the author, and there you have the hidden theme. The antics of Uncle Grisino and his three young assistants twist and turn around this idea. If you read this prepare to be enlightened, entertained and disturbed. Robert Elia"
4,Good Solid Read,"Translated from Italian. Very enjoyable, charactors are real, you want to know what's next."
5,"Splendid - More, More, More Please!!!","Authenticated manuscripts exist for over 50 symphonies by this little known contemporary of Haydn. If the 5 symphonies on this outstanding disk are any indication of the musicianship and quality of most of them, then recordings and performances of more of them is long overdue. This is absolutely one of the most enjoyable disks of 18th century music I have ever owned. Exquisitely played, profoundly directed, and perfectly recorded/engineered.Don't hesitate. Get this, and anything else of Wagenseil you can find.Follow up - CPO issued a ""Volume 2"" in 2008 - see it here :Georg Christoph Wagenseil: Symphonies, Vol. 2"
5,Terra: Cooking from the Heart of Napa Valley,"This is a lovely book . I have been to Terra so it was especially close to ly heart and the passion of food carried to their relaionship. A perfect marriage of love, food and the community."
2,Poor Execution,"National Geographic Magazine is famous for their excellent photography; it is the very reason I picked up this volume. However, Wide Angle: National Geographic Greatest Places failed to live up to my expectations. I was underwhelmed not only by a large portion of the images, but mostly by the poorly executed concept. In a title that clearly implies these are the greatest places featured, I felt the chosen photographs illustrated some lackluster locales. Furthermore, the organization was too loose. The book could have benefited from better formating not only of its categories, but of the photos themselves, which are often stretched in an unflattering matter."
2,Why is the cost so reasonable?...,"...essentially you get what you pay for. This book is certanly NOT representative of what I have come to expect from National Geographic.I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book, but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best. Most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish. In the past I've found photographs by professionals like Steve McCurry ('Portraits')visually arresting. Not so here.At least it only cost me $20 oredering from Amazon. If I had been able to preview it beforehand, I would not have thought it worth even the discounted price."
3,Not what I expected,"When I first saw this big beautiful book it was on the coffee table of a dentist's office, and after flipping through it I wanted to have a copy for myself. I guess the item stayed ""saved for later"" in my cart for too long, because when I finally purchased it, the original version was no longer available, and I accepted the substitute offered. I didn't think to check the actual dimensions of the substitution, because as it turned out, what I received was almost half the size of the original that I thought I was getting (approx 6in x 6in vs expected approx 10in x 10in). Now I'm left with an $11 book I don't really want that would cost $4 to return. Technically its what I ordered, but in such a small size that you can't really enjoy the photos as intended. If you're considering ordering this, carefully review the product details to be sure its what you actually want."
2,Disappointed,"In my opinion, Wide Angle does not hold up the National Geographic standards. The photographs are less than impressive and not the usual vivid images normally seen in NG books. Many of the photos are pooly laid out with the focal point in the binding of the book."
4,Remarkable photographs,"The title of the book is misleading. It says, Greatest Places, and the buyer might just imagine he will get to know the greatest of places this world has to offer. This is not the book on the greatest places. In fact, this book is based on the best photographs of a certain place, taken with a different angle; a rather extraordinary shot. The place may not necessarily be a great place but certainly the photograph is great hence, its inclusion in this book.I think any photographer or travel even remotely interested in traveling far and wide should have this book as a reference. Not as a reference to places but as a reference to how to take great shots. The cover shot is exceptional and tells you what is inside the book."
2,"Disappointed, Not what I expected","My mistake, I did not check the actual dimensions of this volume, being a big fan of National Geo's photo volumes, I ordered the book expecting a large coffee table volume, but as it turned out, what I received was less than half the size of my other volumes. The book is approx 6in x 6in vs an expected 12in x 12in. It is what I ordered, but in such a small size that you can not really appreciate the photos. If you're considering ordering this, carefully review the product details to be sure its what you actually want."
4,Best of it's kind,"I like sports games and find many of them are good value for money. But I have found many of the nfl games to be hard to play. If you didn't know much about the plays etc then it made it even harder. But not as much with nfl 2k, sure it helps if you know abit about the plays, but there is a feature where the dc can select a play for you. A good way to get started. The graphics are brilliant, but still has some problems every now and again. The ref is at times poorly done and forget about the sideline graphics. But the stadiums and players are amazing. The few problems the game does have i am sure will be worked out in nfl 2k1. But overall this game is a ton of fun with a lot of playability."
5,Wonderful,"See the ""official"" reviewers slobbering all over themselves above? It's justified.NFL 2k is a new standard that all others will be measured against.The graphics are, as you have surely heard by now, awe-inspiring. It absolutely is incredible. But thankfully the gameplay did not suffer at the expense of eye candy. Call a stupid play, you get hit. Don't expect to call a running play on 4th and 17 and be able to get it like in football games of old.It was rather amusing to watch a roomful of grown men giggle when I used the replay function. You control a magical camera that can show any shot from the blimp to underneath their cleats. It's also variable speed playback via the triggers. You can slow it down to amazingly slow levels, but it is still fluid and lifelike. Think 32x slow motion, and you're getting close.Wonderful game. If you like football games, then you must buy this. If you don't like football games, go rent it and you may find yourself as a new convert."
4,"Excellent graphics, but a lot of improvement is needed.","It won't the computer let me call a timeout when I'm on defense with eight seconds left in a game. I asked my friend on offense to call one for me but he was unable to as well. The create a team feature needs work. You can only choose from about eight symbols (ugly ones at that) to represent your team and for some reason your player ratings of players decreases significantly (from 100 to about 53 for some players) after a game. I still don't know how these details could be overlooked by Sega. By the way, you can only fit two created teams on one VMU so you have to buy more if you want more. Some details are limiting but overall a good game. Sometimes frustrating, but good."
2,"Good looks, awful gameplay","Don't pay a penny for this, folks. Move on to an EA game. There is very little in the way of actual physics calculations between players in this game, every interaction is merely a scripted animation. RBs are stopped in full stride by shoestring tackles. WRs run their routes at half speed while the DBs shadow them *IN FRONT* of their routes. Offensive line programming is horrible. Guards and tackles blow assignments on EVERY play, doubling up on a DT and allowing LBs to come free and tackle the RB at the handoff. There is no player momentum, a flaw I've noticed in a number of Sega Sports games, meaning any player can stop in mid-stride and immediately run full stride in the opposite direction. Sit back and watch the computer play: 3and out, 3 and out, 3 and out... This was an incomplete game that should not have been released. So what if it looks pretty? It plays like crap."
5,the best sports game for the dc,"This game is the premier game in the ""2K"" sports series and should definetly be bought by anyone who doesn't hate sports games."
5,"Graphics, Plays, Players!!! (but no franchise mode)","This is far and away the best looking football game out there. I, like many, grew up on Madden and I have to say that EA better get on this system because they will lose a lot of customers just because of the graphics. HOWEVER, the Madden games have one major edge over NFL2K: the newly instated franchise mode. This has to be the greatest made in any football game and it is the only major chink in NFL2K's armor. If NFL2K+1 has a franchise mode, watch out Madden. You may need to retire."
5,Lifetime Madden Fan Chooses NFL2K,"This game is far and away the best sports game ever...Madden doesn't even compete. I have Madden 2000 for Playstation and all that it is doing is collecting dust. If you want the best and most realistic SPORTS game on the market, buy yourself a Dreamcast and get this game. One warning: you buy it you will be addicted."
4,Good And Bad,"The game play and graphics are great but there is one problem you will have to deal with at the end of the 1st, and 2nd halves of the game. That is calling timeouts. In order to call timeouts you must press start like any other game. But instead of using the d-pad you must use the analog control and then press the ""A"" button. That's also how you would change your controller to d-pad if you're like me and don't play with the analog too much. Hope this helps."
4,Almost great.,"The 2K1 version of this game is much better, if for only one reason: you can actually gain yards rushing. Just try to have a 1,000 yard season with any premier back in this (2K) version. Other than that, great graphics, good game speed, and all the bells and whistles any sports game geek can handle!"
2,Great graphics...,"NFL 2K has probably the best graphics ever on a video football game... but the realism leaves much to be desired. Scoring is way too easy... running is very unrealistic. Playcalling is highly simplistic. If you love eye candy, then this game is for you. If you need a hardcore football game, however, that stresses realistic teams, players, plays, etc, then you need Madden 2000 (especially for the CPU)."
5,Most entertaining footbal video game to date,"NFL2K is a very FUN game to play, with excellent graphics and sound. However, some things I'd like to see in future versions:1. Career mode either with NFL team or a custom team.2. Ability to develop players as the season progresses.3. Ability to see player skills breakdown during the game (e.g. QB rating in accuracy, power, running speed, etc), and not just an overall rating.4. Play routes on the VMU and not just the play names.5. Ability to ground the ball to stop the clock after a quick lineup without calling an audible or timeout.6. Varying NFL season schedules (currently always the same, unless you chose fantasy football mode)These are just minor criticisms that do not really affect the playability of the game, but I think would increase the longevity of the game's appeal."
4,real fun game ever,"great graphic and animation make is game special. Rookie level is so easy that you can throw hailmary with your eyes shut. Pro level is more like real. although occasional flase announcement and limited play make players bore quickly, this game is really fun game to play and you won't want to play any NFL games on sony playstation."
5,best football game out so far...,"if you have a sega dreamcast, and you like sports games, this is the ultimate football game. its very realistic. my old man thought he was watching a real football game on tv! My personal favorite feature of this game is the tackling- i mean you can pick up the ball carrier and literally drop him! its incredible. the graphics are incredible too. this is a great game."
4,10 year old player,This game is one of the best sports games I have ever played. But it takes up to much space on the VMU
5,great,"really great game, not as fun as nba2k but still the best football game ive ever played. ridiculously real. ive actually watched a whole 60 minute game of two computer teams playing each other. one time the announcer stuttered. thats real."
4,NFL2K- The Best out there,"I would reccomend NFL2K to anyone. It is the most realistic game around. But if you're into bone crushing tackles and spectacular plays, you should check out NFL Blitz 2000. I've noticed that pretty much all of the passes you thrown are completed (in NFL2K), so you could say its an easy game. Check it out; its worth while!"
4,good football game for the sports package,"Well I played NFL2k and I love the graphics and sound of the game. However the gameplay is not up to par w/jm01, its hard to juke or jive your way around the defense, just one move and thats put your head down. No franchise mode, can make unreal trades, (ex. I traded Tony Martin for Issac Bruce and the dolphins said that they rejected the trade, but I overruled them) Takes up alot of memory, so 1 vmu will be used just for that game.Overall it`s worth the money, cause its just as good as Madden!!"
4,Best Sports Game to Date,"This is simply hands down the best Sports Video game to date. Yes there are some games out there that have more options, but none come close visually. If you like smooth game play and sweet graphic's, than this game was made for you. The only thing bad to say about this game is that season mode takes up one full VMU, some people think that there is a lack of plays, but that is nonsense. If you don't think there is anough plays here, Sega has gone out of their way to allow you to create your own plays. I have played many PC Football games, I have played many of football games on all different platforms and NFL2K wins Hands Down. This Game will set the new standard for Sports games, ( Way to go Sega )."
5,The Best Football Game EVER!,"There has never been a better looking or playing football game! I have owned this game since it was released months ago and it keeps getting better every time i play it. Another good thing about this game is the difficulty, instead of other football games this has 3 different levels of difficulty that are actually hard to beat! (try winning a season on ALL-PRO and you will see what i mean!) There has never been anything like this and it will definitely please any football fan there is."
4,A great read for a traveler to Bali,"I took this book on a recent once-in-a-lifetime trip with my fiance to Bali. I found it an enjoyable read as we traveled around the island. The wealth of insight into Balinese culture, including cuisine, music and dance, really stimulated my interest in the island's culture. Definitely think reading this book can lead the traveler to seek out experiences they may not otherwise discover. For instance, in Ubud, we stayed at the Sayan Terrace hotel overlooking the valley McPhee discusses in the book. We also saw a wonderful legong dance performance.I didn't find this book to be necessarily an enthralling read but definitely recommend for someone traveling to Bali."
1,Tea with Mussolini is just plain awful,"Tea with Mussolini is just plain awful. What a waste of talent witha deplorable script that will make you cringe. It's painful to watch. What really is gaulling is that this film is available on DVD and another Maggie Smith film ""The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne"" is not available on DVD. Now that's a tragedy. I wish I could be more complimentary but ""Tea"" is such a disappointment."
1,Tea With Mussolini,"For all the hype and name cast, I found this to be an awful movie. The acting, especially that of Cher and Dench, was amateurish and, I would think, an embarrassment to the participants. The predictable story line had no depth and nuance. I could barely watch it through...only the prospect of seeing how much worse it could get held my attention. In that respect, it did not disappoint."
1,Boring,"The movie is frankly boring, at least for the male members of the race(most women seem to feel differently). I think it was the longest 2-hour movie I have ever watched. The storyline is slow, and boring. A must not see."
2,not that great...,"when I first saw this movie, I immediately realized that American actresses don't need talent to be on the screen. Popularity maybe, but not talent. We are lulled into enjoying the scorpioni for what they are: Brit subjects who have invaded Italia for a life they don't have in England. Enter the American women. Compare the acting abilities to the Europeans. There must be some American actresses with a bit more talent than what appears in this movie. It screams imbalance. Skip it."
5,"excellent cast, story, even history","Tea is one of my favorite movies. An ensenble cast works exceedingly well together(the Americans as well as the English, perhaps surprisingly), the script is exceedingly well done with both humor and pathos, and surely the ""history"" of that perilous time is fairly represented."
3,About as much fun as a war can be?,"After having read about B24 and P47 bombing raids on Italy,we should be happy any of the old buildings made it through the war?Here we have a story about a young fellow whose guardian was anEnglish old Maid in Italy and whose father had other interestswith a second wife and a second mistress.We have the upper class British (and some Americans) expatriates in Florencewho became prisoners after war was declared in 1940,living in an upscale prison camp. The German presence in Italythankfully lasted a relatively short time,but this movie never really touches on the real war, but onlythe story of the old English ladies and their hardships.Making war on old ladies is some kind of sin?The movies is fun and I liked it."
1,has to be the worst film ever,"I have an upper level college class on totalitarianism and had to watch a film related to Fascist Italy (this movie seems more about Hitler at times). I figured with a such star filled cast that this movie would be atleast ok. I was wrong about this movie looking ok in anyway. The plot, the acting, and the over all lack of ability to keep my attention was suprising. Normally I am able to watch historical films or documents with no issues. This movie has to be the worst 2 hours of my life that I will never get back."
4,Acting bliss,"With so many fine actors in this film (based on the real life of the director) it would be hard not to be impressed. This film is carried and made by, and with quality, of the writing, cinematography and, mostly, by the talent of the actors. English charm and depth by the Dames (Dench, Smith and Plowright) meets a fine American (Cher) whose acting always inspires."
3,The most beautiful bad movie you'll see,"Zeffirelli's artistic eye is evident here; there are tableaux strewn about the movie that are wonderful gems, visual little treats of costume, design, and Italy. Unfortunately, you'll have to tolerate some very spotty acting and weird pacing and awkward plot development to see them. Fortunately, you'll also be rewarded with some very lovely acting by a cavalcade of British lionesses. Look up ""withering"" in Wikipedia, and you'll see Maggie Smith's picture. And Joan Plowright's puppy eyes are ageless...she is so darling in this film, she acts as salve to Ms. Smith's saltiness."
3,Tea With Mussolini,"An interesting story. Love anything Maggie Smith is in. Done in typical British style, slow-moving, low-key, but it keeps your interest."
2,is Cher realy a co strar of this film,"When I bought this Dvd I thought it was a Cher movie. She is hardly ever seen in the movie, her role is more of a cameo role. Not a great movie for a Cher fan, if your a fan of world war 2 then this would be a movie you would like. I have seen ever movie Cher has been in, Tea with Mussolini, and Good Times are the least intresing cher movies ever made."
5,Tea With Mussolin; Excellent movie,"Tea With Mussolini is an excellent movie centered around the devastating tragedy of WW2. It is heartwarming, sad, funny, and an all over great movie. Cher's performance is incredible and unique."
4,"Great Movie, But The Tape Is Cut From The ScreenPlay","I'd give it 5 stars, except for the fact that some scenes were cut from the home release. In the theaters, there is more development of Cher's romance with the ""bad"" guy, and more time is given to the boy before he is sent to Austria.Some of the characters were ""rounded out"" a little more in the theater, also.I missed those scenes immediately upon viewing the VHS version."
4,Born under a Bad Axe...,"Even if you don't believe in the reality of spontaneous combustion,this album will make you a believer.You can't go wrong with song titles like'Your Love is Like a Cancer'...The album also features a number of excellent previously unreleased songs,all done by Seals and his live band in their unique manner...blues like molten lava.A historic performance."
4,"If you like your blues rough and tumble, this is your cd","If you have never heard a Son Seals cd, this is the one to hear. He rumbles through 60+ minutes of ""Bad Axe"" blues. Seals sets the ultimate mood in blues with ""Mother Blues"" and jams all the way through the finale, ""Don't Lie to Me"". With an eclectic backing band, including an impressive horn section, this is a must hear for all Music fans not just blues fans."
5,pure classic,first all son seals is probably in my top five bluesman of all time. and this cd is simply amazing. his studio albums are really good but he really shines on the live albums. so do yourself a favor and pick this one up
4,Where's the new edition?,"This is an excellent book. But I have seen a 1996 edition of it, not described above."
3,An OK introductory book,"This book is very clear in explaining basic concepts and computational details. On the other hand, the book lacks mathematical beauty, all the exercises are trivial computation, check this and check that. It is disappointing that the book doesn't include many interesting topics, such as black hole thermodynamics, Hawking radiation, etc."
5,Excellent Book,"Who knew that a book about such a serious topic could be so witty and fun to read. Burdick takes the reader on an excellent world tour -- and he makes a the best sort of travel companion.If you're tired of the shrill discourse that surrounds ecological matters, you'll welcome this book. Burdick has no axe to grind. He clearly went out to report on this complicated topic with an open mind. What does it mean to label something an invasive species? Can a non-native spieces increase the biodiversity of an ecosystem? Given that humans are the ultimate invasive species, what are our hopes for curbing the spread of other organisms? It's enjoyable to watch a savvy and smart journalist really think about these questions."
2,Boring!,"Really didn't do it for me. Interesting subject - the impact of introduced species on ecosystems - but the book is just boring. Seriously, I have a really high tolerance for dry writing - I read a 400-page book on trilobytes whose author insisted on constantly quoting Milton for no good reason, and I enjoyed it - but this was too much for me.Here's an example: dude spent an entire page just listing the books on some scientist's bookshelf. That's padding, yo. You coulda just said he was ""well-read"" and moved on.Did not like!"
3,Pretty fun bet gets boring!,"I got the Game of Life about a month ago and I played it like 8 times. It was pretty fun but now if you ask me to play is again, it gets really boring. Pretty good graphics! I do recommend this game but just remember it gets boring!"
2,Not the game I ordered,"When I ordered this game it said it would get here in a few days it took a week. Plus, i ordered this version so I could play with other people. The one they gave me was the old version that was single player."
4,This game's cute and fun,"I enjoy the board game LIFE, but this was even better. Along with the regular aspect of the game, there are cute mini-puzzles and great animation which makes this a worthwile buy."
4,Great Adaptation!,"I've always loved the board game version of ""Life"" - I played it hundreds of times with my family while I was growing up. The computer game version stuck to the board game as closely as possible. You spin the wheel exactly like the board game, your little car moves around just like the board game (they even copied the board almost exactly!).It's pretty fun - I've played it a few dozen times and really enjoyed it. I wish that when you are generating your character there were a few more options (your character choices are EXTREMELY limited), but that is the only real fault I could find with the game.The graphics are cartoonish - but it fits! Whenever you land on a spot, there is a short little clip showing what happened to you - these are pretty funny! Overall, it's a cute game. It would be perfectly acceptable for kids too - there is nothing bad in the game at all! Since its so cheap, I definitely recommend getting it and playing around, especially if you're a fan of the board game!"
1,Compatability,"I think this product would be good if you had made it for not only windows 95-98, this needs to be made for EVERYONE!"
5,Adictive,"This is a great game. Most of the time I get a game, play it for about a month, and only look at it on a monthly basis. But not this game I got it some time ago and still am having loads of fun with it."
3,"Good game, Good graphics, But gets boring","Game of Life is a great game, but unfortunately it gets boring after playing it for just a couple of times. The 3-D cartoons that run during the game are a nice, cute addition, but after seeing them the first or second time, you want to choose the option to turn them off. It is also nice that after you spin the animated spinner on the game, it looks as if you are driving the car on the board to the space that you have spun. As your car drives around the board, the years change from 1950-2000. And as the years change, so does the style of the cars and the type of music. Another big point of the game is that it is not really very fun to play against a computer player because when you play with another real person, you can interact with him. In my opinion the game isn't worth buying because you will only play it for a few times."
2,disappointing,"The folks who did so well with Monopoly disappoint here. The animation quality is fine; that's not the problem. The game is filled with movies which interrupt and comment on the play; they are very bad jokes and we shut them off pretty quickly. An alternate version of the ""classic"" game includes shooting gallery-type mini-games for bonus points, but the games doen't respond properly to the mouse, so accurate aim is impossible. After a few plays, I passed this along."
1,What a stinker,"This is a nicely shaped, easy-to-hold dildo made of high quality silicone. Easy to wash with soap and water, I can even put it in the dishwasher. BUT California Exotics embedded fragrance in the silicone that smells half-way between cheap perfume and old urine. Too bad Amazon.com did not take the time to fully describe it in the product description."
5,Art To Wear,THis book is excellant for the Altered Artist covering everything from jewelry to clothing. You won't be dissapointed I highly recommend this book. Easy to understand techniques. Easy read.
5,A must read for any Little Big Horn buff!!,"This book is one of the best I have read concerning the Little big Horn, and I have read many. Fox approaches the battle in a systematic way, first detailing skirmish tactics of the period, and then examines soldiers behavior in stressful combat situations. He then uses this information along with his archaeological findings to arrive at logical conclusions.Some of the middle chapters that detail the actual digging at specific locations are somewhat dry, but hang with it and you will be well rewarded in the later chapters.Nice maps and aerial photos throughout: you won't be disappointed!"
5,One of the best books written on the subject,"I have read this book 3 times right through and at least 5 times on selected chapters. I cannot praise this book enough. If you read this book and ""Custers Last Campaign"" by John S Gray you will have the complete picture of the Battle from an Archaelogical and a Time and Motion Study."
1,A Disappointing tome,"This book is a perfect case of prejudging history and 'bending' facts to fit said prejudgment. The entire concept of doing archeological analysis on a looted site and using said analysis to draw serious conclusions about a 133 year old battle is questionable at best, dishonest at worst. The selective interpretations of the indian accounts is also a grave error in this book. I found this book useful as an example of how 'not' to treat the battle of the little bighorn. If a Custer supporter had attemnpted this kind of nonsense, he would have been pilloried."
3,"Interesting, Dry and Inconclusive","While I find the suppositions about the movements of the Custer battalion intriguing and the idea that the unit had lost cohesiveness and disintegrated entirely plausible, I agree with other reviewers that, given the popularity of the battle site ever since that dreadful day, the archeological evidence may be tainted and may forever preclude us from deterimining the actual events of this part of the battle. All in all, an interesting and thought-provoking read, though abit dry."
4,supernatural realistic game,This is the finest basketball game around and the players faces are so realistic. The only tiny problem with it is that there is too many put back dunks. It happens also when the opponent misses a free-throw.
4,This is the only review you NEED to READ! :),"I don't understand how anyone could not like this game. It easily destroys the competition with one swift stroke, rendering EA's yearly contributions looking like cheap imitations, and I'm sorry EA, the promise of Michael Jordan in Live 2000 isn't a seller for me. My only gripes about NBA is that on more than one occasion obvious fouls are not called and the inconsistency of throwing cross court passes, but none of those affect my decision in owning this game. The graphics and gameplay are fantastic. This game rocks. If you love B-ball and you have a dreamcast their is not reason why you don't have this game. Ditch showtime for what it is (another NBA jam clone) and get with the times. Although not as refined as NFL 2K, NBA 2K does a fantastic job, and next year's installment will only improve on an already reward deserving title. EA is no longer the god you thought they were people. Open them eyes...Visual Concepts has just said..EHH..EHH!"
4,Only 4 stars but still the best NBA game ever,"This game looks great! The only problem with NBA 2K is all the glitches. (ie- injuries, the way players re-act) Other than those it is a superb game that almost everyone will be happy with. There is a good level of difficulty in this title even on the simple -pro- setting but it hasnt stopped me from playing game after game in my season. This is also the only NBA simulation game available on the Sega Dreamcast as NBA Showtime is nothing more that a glorified NBA Jam! This game is definitely worth a try."
3,"Good graphics, could have had more detailed play.",Only a certain amount of the players in the game actually do their patent moves; and these moves comes from players like Ewing's delayed free throw. Most of the pg's in the game play way to similar. Iverson's and Derek Fisher's game are like one. It is too easy to dunk in the game. When Voshon Lenard (Heat) dunks on a baseline drive thats when you judge the real play of the game. Colors and details such as coach response is great.
4,Awesome Graphics; Fast Paced Fun.,"Real Impressive. I was looking forward to this game and I'm pleased with it. The menus remind me of the NFL2K game (which is nice for a quick start)and from the get-go, the game's graphics were just great. I was impressed with the announcing of the starting line-up..detail, detail, detail right down to the blinking eyes of your players. This is going to be another Sega Sports Hit."
4,Could have been better,"NBA2K is the best basketball game right now on the market, but it could have been better. The graphics are great, and the game play is a load of fun. There are two things I don't really like about the game. First, the camera angle. I can never find an ideal camera angle to play this game, and see the entire floor clearly. It would have been great if there is an automatically zoom feature that zooms in the action when the ball is at the low post. Second, I think there are some bugs when passing the ball. Sometimes, the ball is passed out of the bound for no reason. Overall, this is a great game, deserves a 4 star. I am waiting for the next release of the NBA2K1, maybe."
5,Fun except for some bugs,This game was easy to play. Smooth to say the least. So many choices which enhance game play and keep it from getting boring. There were some bugs in my copy though. Some stats kept getting incorrectly saved. It could've had more stats too. Quite worth it...
3,Whats up with the sound?,"This is an amazing game, but I have one complaint. The comentators are all garbled. It is like listening to a scratchy radio broadcast. I called sega and they told me to exchange the game which I did only to have the same problem. Are other people experiencing this? Other than that the game really is amazing."
3,TOO EASY,"Graphics are nice, gameplay is alright, but the computer is HORRIBLE even on the hardest setting. One pump fake and then it's an automatic dunk. It's rare for me to beat the computer by less than 30 points. However, it's still fun to play against friends."
1,"It looks great, but...","It won't completely load up! At least my copy wouldn't, and from what I have heard, I'm not alone. Sega really seems to have soiled themselves on this one."
1,i cant recommend this one.,"I have said this before and I will say it again, graphics do NOT make the game, its the gameplay that really counts. The only basketball game that i can really recommend at this stage in the game NBA Live '2000, because it's full of features. This one just doesn't cut the mustard in my book, besides this one doesn't include Jordan, what a waist, just dont even waist 50$ one this, maybe a rent, but that's it."
4,"Great w/ just one, no two flaws...!","The Graphics are outstanding, you can actually see the the facial expressions on the characters changing while they are dunking the ball. Which you really do not get to see alot because it is tough too get inside under the hoop to dunk, the computer will not let you get by easily, but with a little practice you will get the hang of it, and soon enough you'll be able to break through the defense a little easier. The other flaw that i think is a huge flaw is that that game needs one whole VMU (200 blocks) which you will have to get unless you are only going to be using the 2 player mode."
4,Nba2k is #1,"I think Nba 2k is the best game for DREAMCAST. It has great graphics and is a fun game. You fell like you are coaching and/or playing the game, its great."
4,NBA 2K is SWEET!,"NBA2K has the best graphics I have ever seen all you have to do is look at the players face to tell who it is. You can do some pretty awesome dunks whether you're doing a 360 degrees dunk, or a alley-oop back jam it feels like a your really there. This game is so detailed the courts look perfect the fans actually stand up and try to distract your opponent while he's shooting free throws. Speaking of freethrows that's the bad thing about the game ,you have to line up the arrows perfectly to make it. It's really hard. overall this game is SWEET!"
5,From sheet metal to sheet plywood,This is truely my most used power tool both at work and home. At work I use it for driving tech screws in light and heavy gauge sheet metal and at home I use it for carpentry and general home improvement. My father who builds cabinet had his reservations about using a power screw driver based on his results using a cordless drill (over tightening/stripping.) I gave him a new impact driver as a gift and based on his raving about it I wouldn't be suprised if my brother received one for Christmas. If you purchase one remember it is an IMPACT DRIVER and not a DRILL. I witness a lot of people purchasing the drill chuck adapter and trying to use it as a drill.

1,"Won""t work- Windows 7","I bought this when I had an older operating system. When I bought new computer with Windows 7, it would not work. It is not compatable with Windows 7 and there is no download available on the product to make it compatable."
1,Don't waste your money on this junk,"Not only is this thing an overpriced piece of trash, it is also packaged with less than honest information. Right on the Amazon website it says ""works with Mac and PC."" On the package, under system requirements, one line reads ""Mac OS 8 or greater."" And yet, what happens when it is actually plugged into a Mac? Absolutely nothing. In order to store anything on the drive, you must use the software ON THE FLASH DRIVE, but all the software is PC based. What the hell? So I go over to the Memorex website to do a little troubleshooting, and what do I find there? NO MENTION OF THE MAC WHATSOEVER IN THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS!! So apparently, despite promises to the contrary, this is a PC ONLY device!Oh, yeah, and when I did use it on my PC at home, it wouldn't eject properly at all, as has been described in other reviews."
4,"great history, well told","A great essay, detailing who was there at the creation of indie-music's greatest album, and who was left after it all disappeared. Makes you feel like you were there, too. If I were giving the In the Aeroplane cd as a gift (and I often do), I would definitely include this great little book as well. Viva Jeff Mangum!! Come back to us."
2,Not what I expected,"While this book is great if you simply want to learn about what allerges are, it does not give advise on how to treat the problem yourself. It will help you to have an informed discussion about the topic with your vet, but if you are wanting to learn how to treat your animal or what suppliments to use, this is not the book for you."
4,A great addition to our study of the Vikings.,"I rented this dvd to show to my 9 and 7 year olds to supplement our study of the Vikings. It was a big hit. It's not childish at all, but was very interesting and appropriate for their ages. The violence of the Vikings is discussed but not shown. The reenactments helped a lot to hold the attention of the kids too."
4,acceptable for classroom,"This DVD is listed as 62 minutes, but the running time w/o the extras is 37 minutes. An unseen, male narrator describes the events. Action is suggested rather than portrayed. The arial views as impressive. It's fine as a filler for my 6th grade history class."
2,Disappointed,Was'nt as good as program I saw on History channel.Recreations were dull :( I wouldnt recommend this when comparing to other program I saw
3,Average Commentary on Philippians - Better Books Available,"I don't have a lot of bad things to say about this commentary, just nothing very outstanding to say. If you have limited funds, consider Lenski, Fee, O'Brien, Thurston or F.F. Bruce."
