2,Worst Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,This game is a very bad game. When I bought it I expected to be marching around and fighting. All you do is stand in one spot and don't move at all.
2,beach head 2002,"...I JUST PURCHASED BEACH HEAD 2002, AND PERSONALLY I'M DISAPOINTED.THE MOUSE MOVES IN WAYS YOU DON'T WANT IT TO, SCREEN FREEZES UP ECT. I'M JUST DISAPOINTED!!!!!"
4,The Slawter,"It's an interesting book in the series. A little strange and violent, but I couldn't put it down."
3,Slawter,"If you read the other two books of the Demonata, this one isn't good. You learn nothing, it's just a intermezzo i think. You are back whit Grubbs as your narrator, and if you couldn't adapt to Kernel, the one in the second book, this is a releafe! I allmost feared, i'ld have to cope whit another narrator, but i'm glad where back at Grubbs.The story is built up quite nice, but like the other two books, VERY slow. You have 150 pages about a film set, Grubbs' fears, etc. etc... But once the action starts, you can't stop reading. But you have to because the book ends when there was a lot of open space to kill some main caracters, which i want dead! Not to be cruel, but Mr. Shan has missed a lot of oppurtunities in this book."
3,Good by Not All Inclusive,"A good book with lots of names but certainly does not include all those from Kentucky who went to OH, IL and MO, does not include all from the 1850 Census records in MO who show born in KY...probably this authors own research areas..."
5,One of my all time favorite albums!,"This album is awesome, had it for quite some time. It doesn't get old, it's up beat, fun to sing a long, and it's very hard to take out of my cd player! A definate top 5 favorite album of all time!"
2,not too good.,"I was given xenon 2 a few days ago and i have played it for about a minuit. It is not very good and has rubbish repetetive music, and rubbish repetetive game play. Don't buy because its not worth it and you will get bored with it quite easily."
5,The stories I grew up with.,"This is an amazing collection of tales with female protagonists. I grew up on this book and I've loved it ever since I heard the first story. I finally bought my sisters and their daughters a copy since my sisters also grew up on it. We lost the family copy, probably when I was in grade school, most likely to a teacher who saw the value of such a book. Its got tales from various cultures, and various themes. Its not always just the love of a man that she's fighting for, which rocks. I love this book!"
5,Wonderful collection of heroic women,"This is one of the best collections of fairy tales featuring strong and enterprising hereoines. It includes stories from may different cultures, but all feature clever, resourceful women who overcome adversity. some of the stories were already familiar to me, but many I'd never read before. If you thought all fairy tale heroines were ninnies like Cinderella and snow White, you need to read this excellent book and discover women like Kate Crackernuts, Clever Manka, Sea Girl, and the Three Strong Women."
4,Interesting read,"Very interesting recipes. I guess they weren't exactly what I expected... they seem truly authentic to this Americanized Irish girl. I thought ""pub"" food was more like bar food... nachos, pizza, etc. I was very far off. So if you want authentic, this is the book for you."
5,"You've posted your dollar, now buy the book","I came across this cookbook quite accidentally and bought it sight unseen. It is probably the best cookbook purchase I have ever made. Anyone who has been to MacGuire's knows that the food is almost as exquiste and the scenery. I made ""Paddy's Artichoke and Spinach Dip"" for a dinner party and everyone was asking for the recipe. A definite buy for anyone who loves to entertain."
4,No place like McGuire's,"No visit to Pensacola, Florida is complete without visiting McGuire's, an institution if there ever was one. An incredibly fun place to eat, and you could occupy yourself for hours just looking at all its stuff! The Cookbook captures much of the feel of the place, the flavor, if you will. Most might buy it as a souvenier, but the recepies are worth trying!"
4,"Truly beautiful, in word and image","This is a family favorite. It gives me chills, and the kids love looking at the intricate details on each pages."
1,A terrible disservice to the dead and the living,"This book seriously misrepresents the medieval period, its concerns, its possibilities. Not only that, it's factually awful....for instance, Cantor couldn't be bothered to find out that Eleanor of Aquitaine died in 1204, not 1194 as he writes. The book is a waste of money and even raises ethical concerns, coming as it does from a ""professional historian."" As history, it's garbage, as historical fiction, it is dull."
1,Medieval Lives deserves at most one star,"medieval lives is quite possibly the worst historical book that I have ever read. In this book, it is hard to connect with the characters and thus makes it less interesting. In addition, the historiacl backround for each chapter is so complex and written as if he was trying to confuse you that it is almost impossible to ever fully grasp what he attempting to say. I had to write a paper on two chapters from this book and I got nothing out of it. If you need a nice book to make you go to sleep, this is the one!"
2,Cantor light,I was disappointed in this book by Norman Cantor. Sorry - I can't take the imaginary conversations as authentic history and that is what I expected from this author.
5,Great Book for the Home Breeder,"I bought this book to help me get through breeding my two Yorkies. It was comprehensive and easy for the non-vet to understand. If I had a question, it had the answer."
5,Loved it,"We just had a litter and everything went great. There are nine healthy pups. We had to do the slinging thing with one pup, and with the illustrations and directions it worked and the pup is healthy. We didn't loose one!!!"
2,Initial quality and broken items during shipment a problem!,"I am not impressed with the initial quality of this dinnerware. We have had a few items with obviously manufactoring flaws. Additionally, we had three shipments with broken items that we had to return. One of the replacement settings came in a taped-up box with no packing slip. It appeared to be someone else's return because there was also a flawed plate inside. We have returned three boxes so far out of 6, and we have another 6-8 boxes still to be shipped! If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't.The bottom of the dinnerware is rough. The plates and bowls are of good size. The pieces we did receive, that were not broken or flawed are nice."
1,Defective Finish,I ordered the 12 place set. The bottoms of the dishes were rough and left marks on the other plates when stacked. The dishes were easily marked by forks and knives and after only a few uses they all had scuff marks that wouldn't come off. The Amazon return/refund service was excellent.
4,A Warning to Buyers,"There are TWO (count 'em, two) CD's called ""Last of the Whorehouse Piano Players,"" both with Jay McShann and Ralph Sutton, but with completely different song listings. If you want to see the other, type that title into the Search box and they both pop up. They also have almost identical identifiers: The one with this review is Chiaroscuro; ASIN: B000003H98, and the other one is Chiaroscuro; ASIN: B000003H9F."
3,not all inclusive,"I was disappointed with this book as it did not include most of the hardy waterliles I've recently purchased (eg. Chromatella, Helvola). Perhaps I need to purchase the first Slocum book for this information?? They may be included under a different name, but if so, this does make this reference less useful as the common trade names are the key words most of us will be using to find information."
2,Not for My 3 Year-old,"She loves the one Curious George book we have. I bought it on a whim at the store. She cried the first time we watched it (she did like Frog & Toad). The second time, we couldn't make it past the first Curious George episode. Watching him nearly drown, him turning green on pipe smoke and then worried about the fire trucks. My tender-hearted girl who doesn't watch much TV (we do watch some Veggie Tales together) just couldn't get past that."
2,Disappointing but with surprises,My expectation was to receive a Curious George DVD. What I got was a DVD with very little of Curious George (that too not the normal cartoon style)...felt like 15 minutes.... with a more of other stuff like Frog & Toad tales. It was a surprise to have a sampling of Frog & Toad tales.My daughter does not want to watch this DVD after the first time.
2,not worth it,it is not worth the time better to get something from the libary then to purchase this it is not worth the money or time to watch it. poorly done and very old fashion and user unfreindly
4,curious george (collector's edition),"I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this DVD.Even though my three year old daughter loves it, I was expectinga Curious George DVD. Now I will have to make another purchase to get just a Curious George DVD. I will definately start reading the reviews before making a purchase."
4,heart breaker,"i am an adult fan of Curious George. (love the lil guy!) while this is not the familiar PBS cartoon, i really enjoyed this DVD. The stop-action puppetry takes a while to get used to, but the stories are solid. I'd caution parents of small children, George does cry, and TMITYH is not exactly heroic. Still--glad I purchased, and love the addition to my library"
4,Surprised at how much my 3 year old daughte loves this movie!,"We rented this DVD from the library because my 3 year-old daughter LOVES the PBS Curious George. When we turned it on and I saw how different it looks than the current version I thought she wouldn't like it. To my surprise she couldn't get enough of the two episodes! She doesn't care for the Frog and Toad or other stories though.I would not buy this even though she loves it since she only likes the two episodes. I will continue to just rent it from my local library. I agree with some of the other reviewers that I didn't like the pipe smoking scene but I talked to my daughter about how ""yucky"" and ""unhealthy"" that is to do.Hope my review helps your decision!"
3,Not bad,"The CD is good quality and the fact that it's an entirely japanese band playing gothenburg style death metal makes it a bit intersting, topped with the fact that the singer is female. All the songs are pretty solid, but are marked with extremely cheesy lyrical content, which I'm sure you can plainly see just from the song titles. If you have everything from In Flames, Soilwork, At The Gates, Opeth, Dark Tranquility, The Haunted, and you want more of something similar (especially to the first two mentioned), buy this CD. If you are just getting into the gothenburg death metal scene, go for something better, like opeth or really any of the bands I listed."
4,Well played melodic death metal.,"SHADOW is a melodic death metal band from Japan who plays in the style of early Dark Tranquility. The music is VERY well played. The guitar work is incredible and the drumming very good as well. My only complaint with this cd is that it is far from being original. SHADOW adds nothing to the genre of melodic death metal. I enjoy this cd very much due to the strong songwriting, but the fact that this has been done before and better is why it doesn't get a perfect score. If you like In Flames, Soilwork, Dark Tranquility and melodic swedish metal in general I suggest you pick this cd up."
3,Power Metal Death,"Well, hearing a promo copy, this album has to be compared to Arch Enemy. It's a female singer like new A.E. Also the melodic/heavy guitar like Arch Enemy. This is not bad stuff at all, it's got the power metal songwriting/lead guitar style with death vocals-something that seems to be a niche market. All these bands like Dark Tranquillity, Soilwork and Gardenian seem to be doing this. Shadow is a good album and I don't think a metal fan would be dissappointed, however it's been done better.....Arch Enemy (all,) Soilwork (Chainheart Machine.)"
1,Horrible,"This has to be the worst game I have ever played. I actually own a Harley-Davidson Softail and I thought that it would be fun to have a game for the cold snowy days when I couldn't ride. I thought wrong. I would personally rather attempt to ride my 650lb bike on ice rather than have to play this game one more time. The graphics are subpar, the sound is low quality, and the action doesn't even come close to simulating the movement of a motorcycle. Do not waste your time or money with this game."
4,All Their Hits In One Spot,A great collection of all the Devo songs the average listener would want. This CD also serves as a career spanning overview for the serious fan. This disc almost never leaves my car CD changer. Grab a copy for a quick Devo fix.
4,"""When a problem comes along, you must.....","Whip It! (Whhua-ttcchh) Whip It Good!"" Devo (standing for de-evolution of the species in general) has, I think, always been Revo (revolutionary) music-wise since they debuted way back in the early '70's. These five ""spud-boys"" from Akron, Ohio performed some mighty cool-sounding rock-pop tunes, not actually officially fitting into anny music catagory. My favorites on this CD would have to be ""Here To Go"" (Go Mix version, the longest track they've ever done, it seems), ""Through Being Cool"" (from the ""Heavy Metal"" soundtrack), ""Big Mess"", ""That's Good"", ""Jerking Back And Forth"", their remake of ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"", ""Girl U Want"", ""Smart Patrol/Mr. DNA"", and ""Working In The Coal Mine"" (also from ""Heavy Metal"", and also, used as the short-lived NBC sitcom ""Working"" theme song). Even their misses are cool, sort of like experimental B-sides. Until next time, spuds, Duty Now For The Future! Booji Boy out."
4,Really good but for one omission...,"I can argue against 5 stars because of the omission of ""Love Without Anger"", a well-known song that isn't even included on ""Greatest Misses"". Overall, this is a good one to have if you're not a hardcore fan."
4,Buy This now for the Future,"I grew up aware of Devo, but had only bought New Traditionalists. I can wholeheartedly recommend this collection. Forget the other reviewers who claim this album is monotonous, there is a lot of variety here, from the dance remix of ""Go"" to the anthemic Jocko Homo. Cunningly, the songs are mainly arranged from most recent to oldest - a true example of devolution. And a change from the usual greatest hits collection.And would someone please ""fix"" the Rt 202 sign?"
3,its cool,"i dug some of devo especially ""whip it"" which was cold on the synths and groove. liked there take on i can't get no satisfaction"". they fit really well with the early 80's and the material holds up real well. this is a cool collection and covers them real well."
3,HITS,one of many Devo cd's but this one is the second best (Besides an import) with some of the best songs by devo plus some remixed songs this is worth buying to any devo fan or anyone that likes devo music
5,More Devo less limp bizcut!,Devo fans this is it! great CD. Has move of the hits from wayyyyyyy back!
4,new wave please,How can you not like devo. The funnest quirky new wave act. This is a great collection of there songs. I like it alot.
4,"It's not chronological, alphabetical or even horizontal...","Nice selection of 16 songs haphazardly put together. No sense of order. It's not chronological, alphabetical or even horizontal. It's like they put all the names into a hat and picked them randomly. Devo may not deserve a box set but they do deserve a well thought out anthology. But the music is great...strangely dated considering how ahead of their time they were back in 1978."
3,"The fan will be better served by ""Greatest Misses""","I enjoyed this reliving of my childhood (long ago, I had vinyl copies of ""Are We Not Men?"", ""Duty Now For the Future"" and ""Freedom of Choice""; ah, the foolishness of youth to let these gems get away!), but I wasn't blown away by this collection. I would like to have seen more early Devo (""Praying Hands"" didn't make the cut on either album!), and less of the tame (some would say poor) new material (""Working on the Coal Mine""? Gimme a break!). ""Satisfaction"" is here in its unadulterated glory, and I can still remember getting chewed out by my parents for singing the lyrics to ""Smart Patrol/ Mr. DNA"" (I was eight at the time!). Still, this album seems more suited for the ""Whip It"" crowd (nothing wrong with that, but not my cup of tea); there is an abundance of ""Freedom..."" material here. Still, it's not too bad!"
4,The Best of the Devo Collections,"Sixteen great songs at a budget price. Can't go wrong here. This collection represents DEVO at their most enthusiastic, pop smart best. It also shows how slickly they pioneered the synth heavy dance sound that so many imitated through the eighties. The classics are all here (""Whip It,"" ""Jocko Homo,"" ""Satisfaction,"") as well as a bunch of should have beens, like ""That's Good"" and ""Here To Go."" These were the songs that powered a lot of college new wave dance nights, pogo ready with sing-a-long chorus/slogans like ""Through Being Cool"" and ""Jerking Back and Forth.""The only way to get more is to move up to ""Pioneers That Got Scalped"" for the post ""Shout"" material, but then you have to wade through that double CD's overkill of irrelevant extras. It's a safe bet to have this and the ""Greatest Misses,"" which shows off more of DEVO's wild musical side. As for subversive pop in the MTV age, this was the best there was.HIGHLY recommended."
2,"Once is enough, thank you","Ironically, the songs are easier to appreciate when you can listen to one song occasionally rather than many collectively. I did enjoy hearing these songs again, but I couldn't do it in one sitting. The one joke theme of Devo is their dehumanized song styling, very stilted and deficient. Unfortunately, the punch line becomes very tedious quickly."
5,Must-read for anyone worried about violence!,"I heard this author on 3 NPR interviews in about a week (Fresh Air, To the Best of Our Knowledge, and I think Todd Mundt) and with each interview knew more certainly I HAD to read this book! I was not disappointed! As a teacher and sometime child advocate who's very concerned about youth violence and the messages of the media I knew there was a lot more to this than we usually hear. This book has that ""lot more."" This is not just the usual defense of media (Mr. Johnson's review takes something totally out of context.) I've never read a book that was more obviously by someone who cares about kids--and knows how to listen to them! If you care about kids, media, or society, you have to get to know this book!"
2,only half right,"This book makes a valid point that children do need to connect somehow with those angry, violent, hateful feelings that we all have inside of us. However, the authors acknowledge (near the end of the book) that when children get stuck in fantasies of violence they really do not have a way of growing beyond them. When media violence does not offer children (and adults as well) a way to move past the violent feelings and fantasies that grip them, they do no one a service. That is why the glut of violence in children's media is a problem. Instead of using this book to justify past creative endeavors in the comic book world, the authors would have done better to explore ways of storytelling that would actually help children grow beyond those violent feelings. This book is only half right, and the authors left out the rest of the story... what a child needs after connecting with the painful, disturbing, angry feelings and fantasies."
2,Does American Family Instability Have an Impact?,"Given all the praise for this ""wonderful book"" on the benefits of violence, does this book considers the effects of violence in a present-day society of unstable family life? The violence of my generation [age 50] (esp. in cartoons) was buffered by a strong family life, moral values, and a society supported by a responsible-corporate America - which is not the case today. [Money seems to be the only important thing in America and to hell with the children.] Are we suppose to believe that with the high percentages of youth engaged in drug/alcohol abuse, crime, STD-infections, effects of divorce and other societal ills, that the steady-diet of violence targeted at them has little or no affect?"
4,Must-read for anyone who works with kids or teenagers!,"Eye-opening and pragmatic defense of ""violent"" (although I'd rather say ""action-packed"") children's entertainment by Gerard Jones, comic book historian and organizer of international kids & media workshops. Jones' friendly, rational, well-sourced arguments never devolve into finger-pointing, but instead are based on years of experience in working with kids from all kinds of social backgrounds."
4,A Suitable Adaptation,"I remember popping quarters into the arcade game this cartridge is modeled after in order to finish off the T1000 for good. Though I haven't played the Gameboy version all the way through, I am impressed so far with the adaptation (since there is no light gun for Gameboy -- I think). You can destroy walls and buildings in the background for points and for the bonus items you will need to survive. When fighting bosses, you will take damage, and that brings up two small complaints: you can't fire your missiles fast enough and when you die your target is returned to the center of the screen while the firing that killed you continues. I have been scouring Nintendo's portable library for good titles and this one did not disappoint (especially for $6). I would recommend this over the other side-scrolling Terminator 2 game, which I have finished."
5,Disney's secrets are secrets no more,Capodagli and Jackson do an excellent job of distilling Disney's management methods for application to any business. Their storyboarding chapter alone makes the book a valuable addition to any business library.
3,Where's the beef?,In 30 words or less...vague. Not for those who want a real deep look inside the Disney company's way of doing business. This is a rock skipping across the water...
4,Insightful!,"To succeed in business, you don't have to wish upon a star. Just pick up Bill Capodagli and Lynn Jackson's book describing the ten key success secrets of the Disney Company. The secrets derive from four basic tenets: dream, believe, dare and do. The authors show how these principles led to Walt Disney's success, and how other companies can use them. They include a Disney history to illustrate how the company has applied its principles from films to video to theme parks - including how Disney has learned from its problems and failures. They provide examples of how other companies have applied the Disney Way. We [...] recommend this excellent book to anyone with an interest in business strategy or marketing. While the principles it outlines may be familiar, Capodagli and Jackson demonstrate in an original way just how these principles can contribute to success beyond the Magic Kingdom."
1,Yawn...,"Although interesting in many ways, I find it to be a major snooze fest. I just can not find it in me to actually soak up the information because it makes me want to fall asleep in mid sentence."
5,The Bible for taking care of guests,"Disney was the first organization to truly understand and implement a service ""culture"" and they are the best. Many organizations have ""copied"" the cultural identity process and customized it to fit their business model, which is great. To learn how Disney does it and how you can too, this book is a must read."
3,Some good ideas but...,"I find it a bit odd that two authors would write so much about Disney without ever actually being Disney employees. With that out of the way, sure there are a lot of interesting concepts presented that buck the management norm. You should have no problem finding ideas in the book that you can implement or adapt for your organization. Oddly there were many Sept 11th references in the book that really added nothing to the story, kind of puzzling why these were so liberally used. Worth buying."
3,A few interesting toons but a few clunkers...,"Firstly to address the reviewer below. Scrub Me Mama With A Boogie Beat is way more racist then any of the cartoons on the Warner Bros. Censored 11 list including Coal Black. Coal Black actully did what a lot of films did NOT do back then and actully acknowledged the blacks contribution to WWII, while Scrub Me Mama just shows them to be awfully lazy. As for Inki And The Minah Bird, this is one of Chuck Jones best cartoons and the all the gags in the film have nothing to do with Inki's ethnicity even if characiture is offensive.Those are still instresting to see along with Betty Boop, Walt Disney's Alice Cartoons and Scrap Happy Daffy but there are a few cartoons on there which are very boring. The video and sound quality is so-so, absolutely nothing near the Looney Tunes Golden Collection or such but if you really want to see some of these cartoons which are entertaining for buffs only then it's pretty good value for money."
2,super small,"very small, much smaller than i expected and i measured it, it either is wrong or dimensions were wrong.Would not recommend at all."
5,LOVE IT!,You really can't beat this item for this price.I bought mine to use as a deep fryer and there's nothing better than cast iron for that purpose in my experience so far.The product arrived in excellent condition and the seasoning has darkened to a perfect black after one use.The price is just amazing for this item. You won't find it cheaper anywhere else. And it is cheaper than a lot of those crumby electric deep fryers out there that are a total nuisance to clean and don't have a large enough capacity to be useful anyway.
5,Great Lodge product,Dutch Oven arrived fully intact. Works as advertised. What else can I say about it.
1,dutchoven,this dutchoven was damaged on it's interior as the finish was scraped off in 2 large areas from handling ( all the texture was gone as well as the pre-seasoned surface they advertise ) at mgf or the vendor it should have been a reject and am returning it this is one of my gripes about buying on line they pass off seconds and rejects counting on people just accepting it and not returning items that are obviously trash
4,I sent it as a gift,"The recipient liked this very much. He has other cast iron cooking pots but this is sturdy and the size is great. The price was good, too."
1,Miami is not the capital of Florida!!!!!,"Within my first evening glancing though this book, I noticed several errors. The most obvious error is stated in the title of this review. I attribute this to very poor editing, as some of the incorrect facts were stated correctly in other portions of the book.The format of the book is good, and the information is categorized well and it is a good reminder of things you might already know but need to brush up on. But what good is a trivia book if you can't be sure the ""facts"" are presented accurately?"
3,"Decent , not great","Every Jeopardy winner wants to cash in , and by and large this is a decent volume, but there are too many errors that I caught for it to be truly reliable. I wouldn't use a question from it without checking one other source. Clearly not all of these were carefully checked."
1,Can't trust this,"This book purports to offer information necessary to do well on game shows such as Jeopardy!, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and so on. So of all things, such a source must be RELIABLE. This book is not reliable at all. It is fraught with so many errors that it's really not worth buying. Apparently Mr. Ferrill couldn't find anyone willing to edit his book. I could enumerate the errors that I found after carefully looking through the text, but I don't see what that would accomplish. Others have listed some errors that they found from quickly skimming it. That should tell you something."
5,The best years of Artie Shaw - a must have!,This is by far the best collection of Artie Shaw recordings as it is complete from about 1938 to 1942. Transfers are first rate and although there are some duds the majority of what he recorded lived up to his aims of not being too of the moment! Buy it whilst you can its a bargain as well as something you will dip into endlessly!
2,Impenetrable,"There is no doubt that Coogan has put hard work and effort into this book. However, I found it to be completely impenetrable and never made it past page 50. Also, this book (in the 50 pages I read!) appeared to me to be written from a Republican slant. Perhaps I am wrong about this and the work becomes more objective as it develops, but I suspect anyone with a Unionist point of view may find this is not the book for them. My background is Irish Catholic and whilst I know there have been injustices in the past, I am by no means an IRA sympathiser. I am still looking for a book on this subject that is more even-handed in its approach."
3,Dark Rising-Brgitte Kingsley,"This movie is basically a Grade B movie, hovever if you just want to gawk at Brigiite Kingsley in barely there outfits this movie is for you. She is a remarkable uber hottie of a different type. If you are hetro it's worth a few bucks to buy this flick."
1,Bad! Bad! Bad!,"So bad that a week after viewing it, I couldn't tell you a thing about it other than it was really bad. That's saying a lot from a guy that likes, or at least tries to find value in any movie I watch. Acting can be bad. If it is bad enough, then the movie could have merit for that. You get the idea. I couldn't find anything about this movie to make it a ""watch this if you ..."" Just no redeeming qualities at all."
4,"Great HDMI cable, but 3-ft maybe a little too short without enough slack","I owned the Acoustic Research PR-185Acoustic Research PR-185 Pro II Series HDmi Digital Audio/video Interconnect, which is just a longer version (6-ft) of this AR PR-184 cable (3-ft). I would highly recommend paying a little more to get the 6-ft version of this cable. From my experience, even if your components are right next to each other inside a cabinet, a 3-ft cable is barely long enough without much slack to slide the equipment in and out. 3-ft might be okay if you just stack your equipments directly on top of each other or if you have a open cabinet with easy access in the back. Enough about the length, the cable itself is of very high quality, comparable to my friend's Monster cable. I have used it for over a year without any issue connecting my HTPC to my Philips 1080p LCD TV running at the native resolution of 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz."
5,Awesome.,"Great price, worked perfectly, bought several, will buy more. Not loose as others described, snug fit. Thought would be loose packing, but came in sealed packaging. HDMI big upgrade at minimal cost."
5,Acosta is one of the best,"this is a great trance album. i have experienced better, but this still deserves 5 stars. great buy and a great add to any collection."
5,George Acosta at his best!!,"""The Lost World"" is George at his best! ""The Lost World"" is nearly perfect from track to track, and definitely shows why George is the Trance Master. Some stand out tracks are: Kompressor, Kyra Vs. Velez, Mindcrusher, and Woody Van Eyden. George's own ""Center"" with Jon Secada is awesome, and I look forward to their future work together. I would say ""The Lost World, ""Touched,"" and ""Miami"" CD2 are George Acosta's best releases, but every single CD(s) he's put out have been excellent! If you haven't already, definitely purchase ""The Lost World""! Probably the best Trance mix of 2005!!"
2,What happened George?,"What happened George Acosta? What happened to that feeling that was in Awake?People saying that this is the best Trance album of 2005 are full of it.And saying that Black Onyx is the best track on here? Ha! That has to be the worst track on here! This track has no melody...just an UGLY repetitive synth that's more annoying than pleasing.Nothing was memorable in this CD...just a bunch of boring anthems that are easily forgettable. Not even the classic ""Born Slippy"" could save this.Although this album isn't terrible...it is defintely NOT the best Trance album of 2005Please...do not listen to these reviewers...they are only trying to trick you into buying this mediocre album or they just have bad taste in Trance music."
5,Great grill pan at a great price,"This is a fantastic pan. I cook for just two and this is the perfect grill pan to grill steaks or chicken for two. I have the larger, two burner Lodge grill pan as well, but this is the perfect size for my wife and I. It is the same wonderful Lodge quality as well."
4,Very good,"We've been avid campers for over 30 years, but never really got into cast iron because of the weight. Now that we have trailers instead of tents, and carrying is easier, we have learned the love of cast iron.We used this pan, over an open fire, to make burgers and steaks. The burgers were okay, but nothing special. The steaks, on the other hand, were fantastic.My recommendation - use the bbq for the burgers and this pan for the steaks."
5,Great Purchase!,"I looked at several grill pans, both online and in the store and decided from reading other reviews, etc. that this was one of the best grill pans. I enjoy cooking with it and it is easy to maintain."
4,Lodge cast iron everywhere griddle,"Used this inside and out. Works great for those nicer steaks that don't cook well in a regular fryingpan and you don't want messed up in the winter inside cooking months.Fits perfect on the extra burner of our outside grill for veggies that I like to saute, no charmarks but just enough grill mark and a better even cooking. Love it. Clean up was abreeze, very important part for me.Only downfall it's quite heavy and needs extra care moving around."
3,Not as good as the !0 Inch pan.,"Having used and enjoyed the 10 inch fry pan shaped Lodge Pre-seasoned grill pan, I hoped to duplicate the experience in a larger capacity Lodge grill pan.Much to my disappointment, I found the 12 inch pan to be lacking. The grids are more shallow and closer together.They don't have the sharpness of the 10 inch pan, thus leaving indistinct grill patterns on the meat.It cooks well enough but really can't compare with the results achieved in the old 10 inch pan. Sorry for the purchase."
4,Not as good as I had hoped,"I have about 30 pieces of cast iron cookware, most of it Lodge. With the exception of my grill pans, all of it is great. That said, I've had to re-season all of the grill pans to keep food from sticking. This pan does not heat evenly on a burner, but is ok on a grill or in the oven."
2,It's A Pain To Clean,"I have had cast iron pans my entire adult life so care and cleaning was not an issue for me. But this pan is a PISA. Every time I have used this pan the food has stuck. I have reseasoned this pan using the traditional method not once but twice and after the second time I grilled pork cutlets and they stuck all over the place. This pan is truely a mystery to me as to why it won't season but it heading to the Goodwill store and I am here tonight to buy a nonstick grill pan.Bottom line, I wouldn't purchase this pan again."
4,grilling with out the grill,i love this pan it does just what i need it to do. its a little more heavy then i thouhgt it would be. i think its worth the 30ish buck i spend. if your look for those great grill marking without going outdoors pick one up
1,Lodge Pro-Logic Pan,"This product did not live up to its description in terms of being pre-seasoned and therefore almost non-stick. I only used it twice. Both times the food stuck to the pan and was quite a chore to clean up, especially when detergent or other cleaners were not to be used on it. I would not buy any of their similar products based on this experience."
3,I was neither impressed nor disgusted,"I stumbled across this series accidentally and decided to try something new. I started reading paranormal romance/urban fantasy this year so I am currently trying to find series that will get me hooked. I assumed this would be one, but it is not. I will not give this book a bad review, I will say only that it wasn't enough to grab me and draw me in. But I think that is due to the fact that I prefer a darker story and more of a conflict. Everything being so easily accepted and devotion given upon first meeting left me wanting more depth. For those who are looking for a light and easy-going story, I would suggest this book."
4,Rutledge Werewolves,I didn't realize this was a great read until I opened this book. Now I have to read all the companion books in the series. I just love them.
3,ok read,"After a one night stand Sophia is stunned to find out she is pregnant. Artemais is sure Sophia is his mate so when he see's in her dreams she is pregnant he goes and finds her. Once Artemais finds Sophia he knows he needs to convince her that they are destined to be together and that he is a werewolf. Sophia is shocked to see Artemias and more shocked to find out that he wants to be with her and his child so she agrees to go to his home and get to know each other, as their relationship continues to grow Artemias knows he can't keep the truth of who he is from Sophia. This was a good story the characters were great especially Artemais's brothers they were hilarious. My only problem was that at times I found it hard to connect with the main characters and I'm not sure why because at times I found myself enjoying this book then skimming. Overall this was a fast ok werewolf book."
2,Disappointing,"I had a hard time believing this was Ellora's Cave. They should have hired a better editor! I can usually accept some editing problems if the book has other redeeming qualities, but I found the characters kind of annoying, both the way they acted and the way they spoke to each other. And a number of the interactions between the hero and heroine were unbelievable to me. The sex scenes didn't even do it for me. I found myself flipping through the book to get to them, and then not really caring about them when I found them. I love romance and erotica, but found this book disappointing."
3,Really liked it! But did not purchase the next book in series!,"I really like this book, I thought the characters easily came to life and I was able to look forward to picking up my kindle again and again. My only issue is that it was to short! I would have liked a little more story towards the end, it was almost as if the author just wanted it finished. I did not purchase the second book in the series because I think the price is to steep for such a short book. Sorry to say I will be letting the series go.. :("
2,ok for free but don't pay for it,i am kind of offended that the price of this book is now $6.00. it was one thing to get it for free and be disappointed but to charge that much for something this medocre is terrible. the story was rushed with the beginnings of two other storylines plugged in to hint at future books when the actual story we were on needed more substance to hold its own. i liked the male characters but sophie left a lot to be desired. there were so many things wrong here i can't even list them but another review hit on the majority. buy at your own risk.
2,"Overall poorly written, with a few good elements","Plot moves pretty quickly, and the main character Sophie has a decent amount of back story. The author tried to weave in another storyline about a half werewolf that is just finding out who he is and what happened to his mom, however I don't think this was done particularly well. In fact, it seems like it was added to make the story seem like it had more depth.The four brothers were fun to read about; protective, manly, good looking, loving...all around good package.I don't think this story was thought out very well, and it shows. Easy read with romance and a good amount of detailed sex (though it seemed to get kind of repetitive). Did not have a clear myth as to how/why there are werewolves, which was a bit disappointing."
5,Not What I expected but still five star worthy,"Despite what i read on the first couple reviews of this book i really enjoyed it. It was a sweet story and though it didnt have any big drama, besides the baby and him being a werewolf, not all stories have to be action packed or in this case packed with sex either. It was a good read and will probably read it again in the future when i need a simple good story."
2,Buyer Beware,"OK I got this thinking it would be more like the series by Patricia Briggs or Susan Krinard. IT IS NOT! This is more like the stuff you would see on Cinemax late at night. I love a good romance/supernatural story but this one fell short.The premise was good in the description which made me purchase it The wording used was more Penthouse Forum and the story just mysteriously ended after spending 20 pages introducing someone I thought would be the bad guy.I would have requested a refund on the second in series Kindle book I bought at the same time but it was too late. Definitely buyer beware!.Scent Of Passion (Rutledge Werewolves, Book One)"
5,Johnny Costa Great solo piano from a relatively unknown master,"These are truly ""unique interpretations"". You hear stride mixed with classical, romantic mixed with bop and more. If you are a fan of solo piano (some of my favorites are Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, Erroll Garner, Tatum, etc...) then you need to get this album. The version of ""What Is This Thing Called Love"" I find stunning! I consider finding Johnny Costa as one of my best musical discoveries of the past year."
1,"Great album, but a botched reissue","The songs here are slightly ""enhanced"" - nice presence, rich bass, brighter high end - and might be an improvement over the old CD on some songs, but this reissue is fatally flawed. Both ""Ax Sweet Mama"" and ""Maria Elena"" are grotesquely slowed down, dropping a semitone or so and dragging lethargically. Also, several of the songs on side 2 have a good bit of crackle in the right channel. Stick with the regular CD. This is a mess."
5,One of the best musicians ever!,Im so glad i was able to pick this 1972 classic up the guitar playing is amazing and touches my heart every time i listen to it.There is a lot of beautiful instrumental pieces cooder does on this album. Like skip james's cherry ball blues i love that song great guitar piece.Maria elena is a very beautiful piece of music and lets not forget dark end of the street thats my favorite song on the album its amazing and touching.The rest of the songs are good too ry cooders sings on the rest of the songs. And legend sleepy john estes plays on president kennedy while cooder tears it up on the mandolin.This is a must if your a cooder fan. I sure glad i bought it! And yes in my opinion ry cooder is one of thee best guitar players i have ever heard. His playing is amazing!
4,Chilling,"I read this book fairly recently, and even when viewed as a relic of the cold war, it is a chilling read. I am not in a position to judge accuracy or the continued relevance the scientific content (although I consider it quite thourough). It kept me awake for a night or two. Scarier than Stephen King and a good arguement for nuclear disarmament."
4,Great fun Game,Hope you have alot of spare time. Could take a week or more to complete a game. The graphics are nice and the characters are cute. Game play is excellent. You have Real Time Statagey games..well this is a Real Long Time Stratagy Game.
5,One of my favorite games of ALL TIME.,"This is a very fun strategy/RTS(lite) game that is not too complicated, yet still deep enough to keep your attention. It's not hardcore, but also not for small children, despite the ""cute"" graphics. Get it from a 3rd party seller like I did for maximum savings (sorry Amazon, you charge too much!).I went through hell to find a new copy of this game and when I found it, I would pay double what it's worth to experience the fun I had with this title. I would recommend it to anyone 8 to 80(OK, maybe not those extremes, but still.. everyone should play this!)"
4,I AM ADDICTED TO CULTURES!!!,I AM A CULTURES ADDICT-i love this game-i have been playing it since it came out-long before it was easy to purchase in america-gamers that enjoy battle realms might enjoy this game-there is a lot of ecology in this game though and those new to the game will find their tribes starving to death-OFTEN-once you learn the 'tricks' to the game-that will not happen-i have spent so many hours playing this game i cannot even make an estimate-i have played all the champaigns twice and all the xtra games 4 or 5 times each-I STILL LOVE IT-if there was only one game i could own-it would be this one! the original cultures
4,LYCRA SHORTS,Very nice shorts! Just the right length!! Love the fit!! Very comfortable!! The only down size to them is they tend to get little holes in them after a few washings. I guess for the price though they are worth the money. I would buy again!!
4,As described,"This product seems to be as it was described. I can't say much for this particular item since I went off of the Amazon sizing chart & it was incorrect. Needless to say, by the time I return the item & get a replacement, it would cost just as much to just purchase another one in a smaller size."
5,Pink Bling,I bought this for my little puppy. Shes a pekingnese. It fit and looked so cute its not to thick in width so it was perfect for my little girl! And I liked that its pink because that way people won't ask is it a boy or girl they see pink and right away know its a girl. I loved the stars and I liked the texture of it. Its strong and looks great. Plus it wasn't to expensive so its a win win situation.
2,Not what I expect from Pfaltzgraff,"We have had Pfaltzgraff dishes for *years* and went to these because we wanted a change in dishes. We have had them for 2 years and they have faded, chipped very easily and the pattern is faded. They are absolutely covered with marks from the flatware. - Ours are the made in China variety if that is a factor in their quality.We have not ever had this kind of problem with the previous Pfaltzgraff sets we have owned. I would not buy again, in fact we are planning to take the remaining good pieces and give them to Goodwill and start over, probably with a set made by someone else. My mother-in-law has has had her set of Pfaltzgraff for something like 15 years and it looks better than ours... From Pfaltzgraff I exepected higher quality."
5,Pflatzgraff French Quarter 20-Piece Dinnerware Set,"I had my eyes on these dishes at the department stores and was waiting for the right price. . . I found that price on Amazon.com, along with free shipping and no sales tax. These dishes are simply beautiful and functional. I love the size of the bowls. I've since ordered glasses to match my set.I read one review that someone was not happy with the size of the cups. I found mugs in this pattern on the Pfaltzgraff website and ordered them to match my set."
3,Attractive but made in China,This set of dishes is very attractive but has some problems in workmanship. The dishes and the bowls are misformed at the bottom and do not stack correctly. Made in China and not well formed. Reasonable is the plus.
4,Beautiful dishes for all occasions,"I finally decided to get a new set of everyday dishes and after looking at many, many patterns, I settled on Pfaltzgraff French Quarter. The lovely shade of green with the other pastel colors makes for a design which I find is pleasing to the eye. I wanted a design that I could enjoy on a daily basis for many years to come, and I did not want anything too gawdy. I purchased a set for 8 because I felt it was pretty enough to entertain with. The only drawback in my opinion is the size of the cups (8oz) but when I have a lot of guests over , I think the cups would be the perfect size."
1,Turn off the Sound!,"The photography is great but the propaganda stinks.I have no interest in ""Pop Science"" about BILLIONS & BILLIONS of years ago. If you like absurd Fairy Tales then this will suit you fine. Happily ever After."
4,Description,"He belonged to another woman!Even as the champagne flowed at her engagement party, Bess realized she was promising herself to the wrong man...Her fiance was kind, loving. Bess had even looked forward to becoming the perfect wife. Until Luke Vaccari walked into the party, mesmerizing her with his raw, shameless sex appeal. The intensity of her attraction was almost frightening.... It was also forbidden. Luke was about to marry her sister, and her feelings for Luke would have to remain a guilty secret. If only Luke hadn't confessed to sharing mutual illicit desires!When passion knows no reason...FORBIDDEN"
3,Delicious...but is it really worth the high price??,"I love this flavor, but it is sold for cheaper in my hometown.Especially when gourmet coffee stands and stores are litterally sprouting up all over the country (including their own candies) the marketing behind this particular item has not kept up with the times.Yes, this jelly bean reasonably tastes like coffee but the taste is not that good for the price."
3,And not a collector's edition,"Made in USA in 2000, Serial# 0009, Playing Time 69:50Hard to believe this is his 11th album already. I first read about this album while visiting kerry's website a while ago. It worries me when the artists says the songs are leftover material, unfinished tracks, etc. I see that, and I interpret that as ""I had no time, no money, no inspiration. If you don't like it, that's why...""Well, THANKS FOR THE WARNING! I figured ""It's from Kerry Livgren, the mastermind and chief composer from KANSAS; it can't be that bad?!? So i broke down and bought it...Guess what: this album is good! Not as much as my favorite, ""Odyssey into the Mind's Eye"", but GOOD! The songs are a bit eclectic, but Kerry's performance on guitars and keyboards is magnificent, and the vocals from all singers are clean and interesting. A few tracks have a KANSAS ""aftertaste"".If this the kind of material he keeps as is ""garbage"", all I can say is: ""When is Volume 2 coming out?"""
5,Can you handle the Truth?,"Framing Youth, author Mike Males' follow-up to The Scapegoat Generation, is simply the best book out there in regards to understanding our adolescents' ""dreadful behavior"". Politicians, the media, and even what we think of as ""unimpeachable scientific agencies"", have led us all, even us health professionals who work with adolescents on a daily basis, to believe such a distorted view of reality, in relation to our ""problems with teens"", that we routinely take what appear to be logically good decisions to benefit teens, then wonder why those kids ""just don't get it"". In reality, it's us adults who haven't yet ""got it"". Mike will take you through the Top Ten Reasons Why Kids Have a Bad Rep, and afterwards I guarantee you'll be a better health professional, community activist or politician in regards to understanding adolescent behavior. Just be sure you can handle the truth, because the enemy is us."
2,"Ahem, what about 50% of Phish?","A great idea, and a fun coffee table (bathroom) book. I am, however, disturbed by the omission of Phish's rhythm section. Michael Gordon and Jon Fishman are undoubtedly more talented than half the people in this book. It would also have been nice to explain the true heritage of the many musicians listed in the book..."
3,"Interesting list, boring book","The list of Jewish rock stars is really interesting (Slash, Perry Ferrell, etc), but the book itself is boring. Each entry is just a generic bio - nothing is mentioned about their Jewishness. Almost nothing in this book relates to Judaism except the list of people."
3,Where's Mr. Pop?,"Let's face it: a book like this should have come out a long time ago. But it's NOT complete. Why isn't the ""godfather of punk"" and greatest talent of the second half of the 20th Century Iggy Pop included? A lot of the people mentioned in this book (ie Malcome McClarian, Mick Jones, and the late Great Joey Ramone) owe their careers to the Igg!"
2,Iggy isn't Jewish.,"I have not read the book. I leafed through it in a book store. What can I add that others haven't already said. The one page bios are superficial and there are many mistakes and omissions.I response to the reviewer who said that Iggy is Jewish. Well he isn't. I read his autobiography about 12 years ago. I think he said his father was an orphan who had been adopted by a non-practicing Jewish family. But he wasn't brought up Jewish. Iggy isn't Jewish by decent, upbringing or in any other way except in name (James Newell OSTERBERG) You can hear various anti-Semitic remarks in live and `unofficial' recordings of the Stooges."
3,Really?,"Including Kenny G, Michael Bolton, and Neil Diamond in a book called ""Jews Who Rock"" only confirms that Jews have an elevated sense of humor.This book should be titled ""Jews Who Changed Names and Then Tried To Rock and Occasionally Succeeded.""I would have given this book 2 stars if it hadn't let me know that Gene Simmons real name is Chaim Witz. Wow."
2,Not for Spouses,"This book might be helpful to a Naval Officer. But for myself, a soon to be naval spouse, I found it very overwhelming. Attempting to use this book as a reference guide to learning about the Navy was a bad decision. I would compare it to trying to read a book in another language. Too much detailed information and very hard to navigate through."
5,"Well written, suitable for all world navies to understand US Navy",This is a well written easy to fallow and suitable for everybody. To understand todays US strategy around world I think one must achieve the meaning of a worldwide navy. It is needs to much power to have that much ship all over the world and this book is especially important to understand the common mood of navy officers and their conditions.
5,"From the Author of ""Sleeping Dragon""","I met Carl Smith a few weeks ago. We had a nice author-to-author chat. The next day, I ordered the book. Quickly I found out that it was very hard to put down.I keep asking myself -- ""Where does the truth end and the fiction begin?"" Saying I enjoyed the book is a gross understatement. Good job, Carl! You mentioned another book in the wings. I am anxiously waiting."
5,CAPTIVATING FROM BEGINNING TO END,"I not only read FRINGE PATRIOTS once, I read it twiceand found it just as captivating the second time around. Mr Smith wrote the book in such a way that I felt as if I knew each and every character personally. I laughed and cried with each one. The ending of FRINGE PATRIOTS certainly left me wondering, and wanting more from this new writer. I can harldy wait until the release of the second book in this series. I certainly look forward to reading it and am waiting anxiously for it to be released."
1,Don't waste your time on this book,"This book is bad. Don't waste your time or money. I gave this book one star -- and one star is a gift -- because there is no lower rating. The book is amateurish. The plot is implausible and is never developed. Characters are silly stereotypes from somewhere. This book reads like a rough draft written as a creative writing assignment by a college freshman who has read too much Clancy and Ludlum. I am a retired Army officer with 25 years in intelligence operations -- I laughed at every page -- the situations, the actions, everything about this book is silly. The author hints that this book is semi-biographical -- I doubt it. Here's some advice for the author: I understand you have sequels in the works -- save your time."
1,Be Warned - Not the Actual Book,"I ordered this thinking that I was getting a paperback version of the book ""research design in counseling"" for $8.95. I should have known better! Instead, I got some sort of outline of the book that you are supposed to take to lecture and use as guided notes.I will be returning mine, but hopefully, I can save someone the same trouble!"
2,No scholarship here!,"The book has some interesting vintage erotic photos, but virtually no attempt is made to place them in any historical context. The text is uninformative and useless. A waste of money!"
3,Interesting for locals,"This book was available from Sacramento Cable years ago as a premium when you earned a certain number of cable points. It's quite interesting for locals and has a lot of pictures of what places looked like in the past versus now (for instance, the famous Alhambra theater on Alhambra blvd is included next to the grocery store that sits there now). If you live here, go to the library for this book. If you are thinking of visiting the area, skip it. If you are truly interested in Sacramento History, the Sacramento Room at the Central library in Sac has a plethora of information."
2,Reading Floor Lamp,This item fell apart after a year of use. I had purchased 2 lamps and both fell apart. This was a disappointment because it was exactly the style and look I wanted.
2,"For an Arthur Clarke book, it was far from my expectations.","This book tries to give us a small hint of what the future may be. Arthur Clarke tries to describe the future as his creativity imagine. It was writen in 1986, but I read it in 1997, so some of book's predictions seems idiot to me. In my point of view, Arthur Clarke should focus on a story, not fortune-telling. Of course science ficcion must do some wild guess, but a good book is sustained by the plot, not the situation."
1,inexcusable,"As another reviewer mentions, this translation incorporates interpretive comments into the text without any indication that they are not Heidegger's words. I was simply floored when I went to the original to check a passage that seemed fishy in the translation and found that there are whole sentences in the ""translation"" that Heidegger did not write. This is simply inexcusable and renders the translation almost useless. If I ever had any curiosity to look at her translation of Being and Time, I certainly do not now. I hope that a competent scholar publishes a real translation of this important work someday."
5,Simply the best!,Anyone interested in the historical grammar of Greek can do no better than this little book. It sets a new standard by a renowned linguist. It is available through amazon.de.
5,Nice pouch,"This keeps my son's mouthpiece protected and helps him keep up with it. He has to carry his mouthpiece around and this keeps him from losing it, like he did the first one."
1,Misled by the picture,"Yes, the description does say ""POUCH"" but if you misread it and look at the picture you will think you are getting a pouch & MOUTHPIECE... there is NO MOUTHPIECE in this item! I was wondering why it was $25 less than all the other mouthpieces."
5,A complete source for Thai Buddhist paintings,"With solid background in Thai painting and history of art combined with his first-hand experiences seeing the paintings from the sources for over a decade, the author painstakingly weaved all the information you would want to know about Thai traditional painting with his interesting points of view and observations."
3,Sub par,"I almost gave it four stars because it's close but the delivery of so many of their rhymes annoyes me. The content is good and the beats are decent but if the flow isn't right, I cringe..."
3,worked ok I guess,"I bought this for a trip to Hawaii, but only used it a few times. I guess I didn't know how to use it properly because the shots I took were too deeply pink colored. I was expecting a less intense color to the sky. I will experiment with it a little more."
4,Quick Dry - No Lint Residue,"This is the best product to buy when you're in a rush.. especially in the mornings getting ready for work. The Aquis Body Towel is large, absorbs water quickly both body & hair, and no lint residue. No rubbing needed, simply pat dry(especially good for woman who will use body creams or oils afterwards). The towel itself dries in a short period of time, so you don't need to worry about having a damp towel later in the day. It's light weight which is so much better than the heavy gram towels that stay damp till the next day, and feel hot especially during the summer months. It's worth purchasing, also great for traveling, you won't be disappointed."
5,Microfiber Towel,"Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel, Seafoam, Extra Large (29 x 55-Inches)This is the second set of microfiber towels I have purchased; this set is so I can have one set in the wash and not have to rush to dry them. I only need wash these towels once a week, sure saves on laundry anyway.I am spoiled with the instant dryness these towels bring, using a cotton towel now is such a lengthy chore.These towels are well worth the money, don't hesitate to buy."
5,finest towel in recorded history,"the pink is perfect, the crepe is delicious to the touch and capaciously absorbent, the little aquis label is subtle, even distinguished, in a modernist sort of way. You can pat yourself dry; you needn't rub. Before I received my acquis microfiber body towel, lisse crepe, pink (29 x 55-inches), I suffered from an unidentified viral syndrome, leprosy, fallen arches, and acid reflux, all of which vanished with the very first use of this extraordinary item. With the religious fervor of the healed, I recommend it."
2,aquas towels from Amazon,"Products arrived quickly and undamaged. Towel colors were not true to description, and so, disappointing. I returned them.I have been purchasing microfiber towels from Aquis for years, the quality is wonderful. I was so happy to find them again, AND at Amazon. It seems many stores no longer carry them.I may try again -- but in different colors!-Diana"
3,Looks old and faded after one washing,"The towel is fine, it doesn't take up as much space as a regular towel so it's good for travel.The pink color became very dull and faded after only one washing. I'm a bit disappointed aboutthe nasty looking color however the towel absorbs moisture very well. I think the white onewould have been a better option."
3,Not ideal,"I understand why many people like Aquis microfiber towels. They are lightweight, dry hair quickly, and compact in the washing machine. For someone who wants a lightweight towel for travel, camping, because of weak arms or hands, or because they pay by the pound to have their laundry washed, there are advantages. On the other hand, I find the texture unpleasant and the towels tend accumulate an unpleasant, almost mildew-y odor over time which washing can't remove. I used these loyally for a couple of years to dry my hair, but eventually I threw them out in disgust and returned to my French waffle-weave towels which are more expensive and harder to find but equally absorbent, extremely durable, always fresh-smelling, and pleasant to touch because they are 100% cotton."
4,Ideal size,"Just as it advertised, it is soft and dries up hair and body quickly. I bought it because it was on sale and thought why not try it out, well, I am sold on this product.Only drawback now is the high price tag..."
5,microfiber body towel,I was looking for a towel that would dry me quickly and this towel did just that. It also dried completly by the next time I needed to use it. I would recommend it to anyone looking to get out of the bathroom faster. It is not soft and cozy but it does the job.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this large one for my long hair, and it doesn't make any difference for drying time. Save your money."
5,Great towel,This is a body towel but my daughter has very long thick hair so it works perfectly on it. She loves it and it definitely helps with the drying process. We would highly recommend this.
5,Perfect travel towel,"Unlike most of the microfiber towels that you see today, this looks more like a suede than a typical towel yet very comfortable to touch. It comes with its own zippered pouch.Absolutely love this product except for the tag.- Super absorbent- The more you wash it, the softer it gets.- Small and portable. We do appreciate more its advantages when we travel.- Well made, quality and amazing detail.- Very light- Not as bulky as a regular towel so it takes up very little space in the washer and in your luggage- Dries much quickly than a terry. Even if you just hang it on the rack, it will dry in just a few hours.Cons:- expensive"
1,Total Propaganda,The only reason why I ever had this book in my possession is because it was required for a college class that I was taking. I can't believe that colleges actually require this information to be taught.
1,Not Pleased,"I never received this book. Apparently it had been sold to someone else the same time I bought it - that's fine, however, I had to write numerous emails inquiring on the status of the book. I couldn't get a clear answer for over a week. This seller just needs to respond with correct information so the buyers are able to make adjustments to find the bookd elsewhere. I ws on a time constraint because this book was for school."
3,I'm optimistic.,"I was unable to actually read it since I dropped the class for which the book was required. But I don't have anything negative to say, so I would like to give it the benefit of the doubt. I chose three stars because I figure it meets in the middle, leaving it wide open and full of potential."
3,Surface research,This book is OK for a beginning look at prejudice today however it only looks at the surface. Prejudice has tatics that are sophisticated today that are not addressed.
2,weakest of all OB's LPs,"I'm boggled by the amount of 5-star reviews of this, the weakest of all Ocean Blue albums. There's really only one standout track on here--""Ballerina Out of Control.""How can anyone not see that either Beneath The Rhythm And Sound or See have way more listenable tunes on them?This album just sounds like a whole lot of filler to these ears."
5,Get this one!,This is one of the better Ocean Blue albums (though I like them all.) Good for listening while at work.
1,"Sad, depressing, not very insightful.","You wonder if she is holding back, or just plain out of the loop in regards to her father's business. You pity her sad life and regret that she decided to write about it. I wish her well in whatever she does."
3,Growing up in the Mafia the Glitter and Pain....,I like this book I am reading it now. I read alot of Mafia books this is a book about a daughter of Sam Giancini. If you like true account stories this one is for you. In the book you realize as a woman growing up in the mafia alot of things you do not know. And the book does jump around alot and jumps into accounts on FBI records but I think that is how the daughter tells her stories when things happen because as they were happening she didn't realize what was happening. The book does jump around alot and may be hard to follow but I do like the fantasy life it protrays and the pain that is caused from growing up in the mafia.
4,Lived thru this!,I lived and worked in Suburban Chicago during a large portion of this book. I NEVER thought we were told the Truth. Thanks.
1,Dissapointment,"I saw this CD as a possability for a church ""Night in Bethlehem"" project...I was wrong. This is nothing more than Middle East Rap not even worth the Jewel case it came in. Don't waste you money."
2,Single label hard to print on.,"I found this product very hard to use in an industrial size laser printer. The 4x6 label keeps getting jammed in the printer and won't print correctly. I much prefer the 8.5 x 11"" sheet of labels with 4 labels on it."
2,"If you bring only one book, bring this book!","These guides are incredibly helpful and became my soul companion. They include most of what other travel guides offer, yet they little pull out maps are comprehensive and small enough to be subtle when viewing, helping avoid the helpless tourist profile. When I travel these books are the first I search for in my awaited destination."
5,Great gift!,"I gave this to my nephew for his 5th Birthday and he really enjoyed it! His father told me that he said, ""This is the most fun I've ever had!"" Both Dad and son really got into this and spent an afternoon working on it together while Mom was out with friends. This little boy also loves tools and the hammer and chisel that come with this set are made of metal so they look real and should last a while. The kit also comes with child-sized safety glasses. I am buying this again for another child for Christmas this year. Highly recommended!!!"
2,"discovery, educational","I bought this for my 9 year old grandson. I was disappointed when I opened it. It was just a block of bird seed, I thought it would at least look like real dirt. I felt it was too juvenile for his age so I gave him something else. It may be ok for a 5-7 year old."
5,Great gift for a Kid that loves Dinosaurs,Bought this as a birthday present for my nephew's 5th Birthday. He is crazy about anything dinosaur related and screamed with excitment when he unwrapped this gift.
4,"What a mess, but big fun for the kids!","Yes, this makes a huge mess. As you chip away at the block, it falls apart in large sand-like pieces that bounce and end up everywhere. The block is very hard and holds together well until they start chipping away at it. Kit includes a real metal hammer and chisel... big fun! We have uncovered just 1 bone so far and they were very excited. We just sweep up well after playing. No biggie. It is well worth it as it's a nice kit and fun for all of the dinosaur fans."
4,"Great bag, beware of bulky sides","Everything on this bag is as described, but be aware that it is quite wide, and looks more like a ninja turtle shell than a computer bag. Once you realize that, it is an awesome bag and protects your costly machine with great ease, as well as hoists your other goodies around with you."
4,No Collapseable Handle,"This Brenthaven backpack is a total package. It got a well padded slot for the notebook container (15""), small pockets in and out. However, I thought the handle will be collapseable but it's NOT. I like it bcos it's big and can contain all my office accessories."
1,so owful and this seller is cheater,this was owful product the seller writes tht this laptop is 60gb hard disk and i found it just 20gb he is a big cheater also there is no wlan in it
3,cane axxessory,Now I can keep my cane ready (on my wrist) to use as I use that same hand to use my house key.
2,Fabric Detaching from screw -- Disappointing,"This was my second purchase of the cane wrist strap. The first one was fine, but the second is starting to unravel. There is a screw to attach the strap to the wrap around the cane. The fabric is starting to unravel from the screw, with the chance that the strap's attachment to the cane can be lost. I've used the second strap in the very same manner as used on the first cane. The two canesare identical and my usage has been the same, so I believe there is a quality deficiency in thisproduct."
5,Well above the mean. but want more of the story.,The story is so good that after I read it a year ago I am still waiting for the other shoe to drop. Is more comming?
4,PHILOSOPHICAL?,"Witty, humourous, satirical, philosophical and written with searing insight... until you read Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's 'The Mistress of Spices'."
3,The gates swung open and a fig newton entered...,"I agree with many that much of the text is witty and sumptuously written. As well, the characters are enjoyable and the situations inventive, and the story builds very promisingly. It's enjoyable writing but not hilarious, please. Does it remind anyone else of Vonnegut?However, I have rarely been so disappointed by a book's ending. I'm not confused about what happened, merely why the author thought it was a good idea. In trying to wrap things up neatly, the author ""closes off"" the characters abruptly and resolves ... what?If you ever feel left behind by modern literature, this is probably not the book for you. To this philistine, it ultimately felt rather pointless."
2,Hullabaloo - why? What for?,"Kiran Desai's debut novel came with praise from all quarters - reputable ones, I might add - and therefore the sense of disappointment was perhaps all the more acute. Everything is there - great style, wonderful wit, wonderfully drawn characters that remind you of Catch-22: well, everything except a plot. Had it been a short story, I would have loved it. As a 176-page full-length novel, I would not recommend it."
3,Humourous...but no great literary feat,I can really see this book being made into a cartoon by someone like Disney or Warner Bros.... and maybe a successful one at that! As amusing as this book was...and as charming as these eccentric characters were...the storyline wasn't really going anywhere. In spite of all the hype and rave reviews this book received....I really can't see what all the 'hullabaloo' was about.
3,A fairy tale?,"This book is slippery. It's tough to pin down, both genre-wise, style-wise, and whether I like it or not. The story line follows the life of a rather ordinary boy who gets sick of his life and decides to live in a guava tree. Magical? Not really. Realistic? Not really. It's not exactly post-colonial, either, which was honestly what I was expecting when I picked it up. Desai's choice to write in English was certianly an interesting one, as periodically she exhibits political commentary, but it's so infrequent that it's difficult to say if she does it more for character development rather than political value. If nothing else, though, the novel is humorous and Desai's sbright language embues her landscapes with the color, light, sound, and smell of India."
3,Too much Hullabaloo...,"The problem with this book was that Kiran Desai was writing this book for a Western audience. In the middle of the book lies this sentence (India is truly a country of miracles). This sentence made me realize that most of the story was written to entice the Western reader, to show how the East really is...whether it is like that or not. But the book was funny, I laughed out loud when Ammaji's dentures took a joyride. I also agree with other reviewers, in the end it appeared that Desai herself didn't know what to do and she just cut it short the best way she could. I could see her trepidation and confusion in the end -- she had written the story, she just didn't know how to end it."
2,Not really funny...,"This novel was selected for our book club this month. While its cover claims this is supposed to be funny, most of us didn't find it to be such. Several of us agreed that perhaps certain scenes might have been entertaining to WATCH in a Ballywood-style film, but reading about them was more odd and strange than humorous. Perhaps it was the delivery; like a joke in the hands of a ""joke-killer,"" the author seems to butcher the scene before it has a chance. Desai should stick to serious literature because she clearly has some talent in that area. Save the funny stuff for someone else..."
1,I don't like stupid people.,"I realize this book is supposed to be a comedy. And if you like Homer Simpson, or Phoebe and Joey from Friends, you may love this book. But stories about people who are completely stupid irritate me. I hate Homer Simpson, and I didn't like Phoebe and Joey from Friends, either. If you hate stupid people, you will hate this book.This book is filled with people who are so stupid, it certainly would explain why India is a third world country.However, I've read other books by Indian authors and I know India is NOT peopled entirely with idiots.I don't need to reiterate the plot, as plenty of other reviewers have done that for me. I will only tell you this book is not funny. Quite frankly, I'm baffled why this author is so celebrated, as The Inheritance of Loss sucked also, although for different reasons.Skip this. If you want a good novel by/about India, read The Hero's Walk by Anita Rau Badami, or anything by Thrity Umrigar."
4,"Entertaining, colorful, a delight to read...","I came across this book by chance with no preconceptions or set expectations (apart from what may have existed from my prior exposure to Indian authors). I found the whole book to be a delight -- colorful, fast-paced, descriptive. It combined good humor with political consciousness and seemed like an affectionate twitting of family roles and traditions of the neighborhood, town and society as a whole. Some of the events, taken by themselves, may certainly seem over the top (like something out of an Indian ""Life of Brian""! -- if you're familiar with the Monty Python film of that name), but the author skillfully layers events so that she creates an internal logic that supports and propels the action, no matter how far out she goes. (And she does go pretty far out!) All in all, a captivating, rollicking, marvelous book."
3,A good book but where did Sampath go?,"I borrowed this book from the library because the book jacket summary sounded good. As other reviewers have mentioned you do not need to know the culture of India to be amused by the characters and their eccentricities. There are some very funny sections. However, I grew tired of the never ending screw ups, the bungling goverment agencies and no one ever taking anything seriously and thought the book dragged a bit. If the book is a reflection of life in India it's not for me. And I still want to know what happened to Sampath. Are we supposed to assume he went the way of the monkeys, mystically and magically disapearing? Read this book for the laughs but don't get caught up in the characters lives too much."
1,Girls Gone Wild on Campus 3,Not worth it! About all it is is a few flashes and a lot of noisy bar rooms.
4,Excellent academic introduction to human evolution,"I am an archaeology professor who has used this book as a text in my human origins class. No, it is not a mystery-scifi read - but it does a quite decent job with a difficult topic."
1,"Pay a lot, never trade-in","I bought this book and it was advertised that it can be easily traded back. No way, it is NOT, you will have too keep it useless."
4,Anthro,"The book arrived early than expected, which was a plus! The book they sent was a brand new book, instead of a used book. Overall I would deff recommend buying this book from here."
1,Typical Ultra-Left Propaganda.,"Much of the focus in this book centers on two issues:1) There are no such thing as human ""races,""and 2) Humans evolved from apes and ""creation scientists"" and ""intelligent design"" theorists are boogie-men up to no good.The book totally ignores research pointing to the contrary regarding the differences between human races and does not go into any detail why there are different ones. Races formed or ""evolved"" in adaptation to their environments and created different cultures to express themselves and survive in their environments to the best of their ability. Humans were created by God and this book only shows how difficult the fossil record is to interpret. It is unknown how many different hominids existed and to what species each fossil belonged and what specimins constitute ""man"" or ""Homo sapiens sapiens"" or not. If anybody is interested in how ultra-left political ideals influence texbook writing and distribution look no further than this tome."
1,Foolish hypocrisy.,"What a fool. I can only pity her, and those seeking true answers who go on a wild goose chase in this piece of trash. Please, if you are interested in evoking or invoking, visit occultforums.com for a free resource, or check out one of the great masters of magic, Israel Regardie, Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, Franz Bardon."
3,poems and prose--okay read,"""Bobby Enchantment"" from burkard's MY SECRET BOAT goes very well with this poem by 12-year-old Max Mandelsohn:Ode to MarblesI love the sound of marblesscattered on the worn wooden floor,like children running away in a game of hide-and-seek.I love the sight of white marbles,blue marbles,green marbles, black,new marbles, old marbles,iridescent marbles,and glass-ribboned swirls,daning round and round.I love the feel of marbles,cool, smooth,rolling freely in my palm,like smooth-sided starsthat light up the worn world."
1,Ugh,"I didn't enjoy this book at all. it was NOT romantic. The ""hero"" was a real jerk and treated the ""heroine"" horribly. However, she wasn't exactly a great character, either. I enjoyed another book by the author but this one was just not good at all."
3,Blaze Starr finds relaxation,"Blaze is a big time actress in this movie who is severly overworked by her lover/manager and must find a restful retreat. She finds paradise at a Florida nudist colony. Now more self-reliant than ever, this causes a rift between Blaze and her manager. How will it end? This is camp madness! Bad acting, bad blocking, badly looped soundtrack, and a lame excuse to show lots of naked people at a nudist colony. It is sheer camp HEAVEN. And the Eastmancolor print is FABULOUS. NEVER has Eastmancolor looked this good. This movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry (with laughter), it will make you the hit of the party!"
2,"Great disc, dull film","I probably made the mistake of my life watching this a) alone and b) sober. Under these circumstances this is my undisputed favourite for the fancy title ""most boring film of all times"". It contains about as much exploitation as a videotaping of a third-graders summer camp (except you're still shocked by some harmless PG-13-nudity) and acted even worse (just watch Blaze walk like someone had replaced her spine with a broomstick through the entire movie). But given a couple of friends in the right mood and a case of beer or two you'll probably end up rolling on the floor laughing considering the dumb dialogue, the annoying acting and the stupid soundtrack. Besides that the DVD transfer is wonderful with splendid, if sometimes too artificial looking colors, and the two bonus striptease sequences are a treat, though. Recommended mostly for die-hard fans and camp collectors."
3,Authentic for the time,"Given the retraints of the time, this is an entertaining enough video. The nudity is very limited, which is awkward given that it is a nudist video. Much better Naturist documentaries are now on DVD, like Mother Naturists and Rituals of Summer both here at amazon. It also doesn't make much sense to have these old titles on DVD as the image quality pales in comparison to the more recent Naturist productions, like the 2 listed above. Overall a fun oldies film but don't expect much nudism."
2,Does her boyfriend ever change his shorts?,"Good Grief, over the span of months that Blaze visits the nudist camp her ""love interest"" (imagine your grandfather with a bad dye job in a tight pair of bermuda shorts) never changes his damn shorts. And he really should never wear shorts. He should always be clothed. This silly nudie flick has nudist camp footage used in ""Double Agent 73"" as well."
2,Not enough!!,"One does not expect much from a film like this, just plenty of nude women. Unfortunately, this movie lacks full-frontal nudity. A major disappointment. Plenty of breasts and bottoms. In 75% of the scenes in this movie the characters are talking facing away from the camera. So annoying."
5,Busty Blaze,Blaze is incredible in this film. If you are remotly interested in seeing Blaze Starr in all her glory get this DVD! Awesome! This is not a movie that you want for the acting.But if you want to see Blaze dressed and undressed yes this is it.
1,Huge Disappointment,"Horrible film. I really only wanted it to deliver in one aspect- lots of naked women. Unfortunately, it came up way short. No full frontal nudity in the entire film. Not even a little. Lot's of topless girls and lots of butts. But it was just to stupid to watch even for that."
2,Not worth seeing other than as a curiosity peice,"Blaze Starr is bored with her life and becomes happy only when she finds a nudist camp, where she feels at home. That's about as far as the story goes. The film is an ultra low budget movie, relying heavily on off-screen narration. Whenever there's dialogue, the camera always shows the person not talking, or - as when Blaze talks on the phone - the character has his or her back to the camera. This way they didn't need to bother synchronizing image and sound.There's no story to speak of and the movie isn't very good at all. It interesting only as a curiosity piece, as an example of the low budget nudie cutie genre of its time."
3,Better than I expected,My 6 year old daughter picked this online and I was a bit leary but she really enjoyed it.
5,Hardy Bamboos: Taming the Dragon,"Excellent photos, clear and concise descriptions, well organized, just a super book for the beginner or advanced bamboo grower or enthusiast."
4,REASONABLY PRICED MEN'S FAVORITE,"Long appreciated for his women's wear designs Shanghai born Alfred Sung introduced his first fragrance in 1986, ""Sung, Alfred Sung."" Since then he has offered several popular scents, among them are ""Forever,"" ""Pure,"" and ""Shi.""Once he turned his attention to men's fragrances he enjoyed the same success, beginning with ""Sung Homme"" in 1988. ""Hei,"" his latest scent for men is also sure to please with its green, fresh fragrance underscored by spices, woods and musks. Nature augments the fragrance with notes of Fennel, Neroli, Jasmine, Lavender, and Cardamon. There's even a hint of spearmint.The bottle is pure Sung, a water drop in a rich blue tone capped by a darkened metallic round. On the top panel of the blue box is found the Chinese symbol for energy, an appropriate description of this scent."
3,What I needed but very expensive,"Becasue of the limited availablity of this prayer book, the vendors are really taking advantage by pricing it so high."
1,Major difference of opinion,"The two previous reviewers found great worth in the book--I cannot disagree more strongly.The book is filled with simple anecdotal information that leaves the impression of a quick visit to each of these places as the brevity of the text attests. There are no maps to help orient the reader. The book left me disorganized and certainly did not convey an urge to visit many of the cities, towns and villages found in the book."
2,Smurfs dvd limited joy,I recently purchased a Panasonic dvd bluray player DMP-Inserting this dvd it saidNot playable in your region Heh ???I have another dvd player (Sony) and there it reproduced wellBE WARNED .The limitations imposed by the mft for over anxious fears of copying rightslimits your joy using this dvdTHIS DVD has a limiting code for a small global area .ONLY FREE in PHILIPPINES SINGAPOOR and other SE Asian countriesI am determined NOT TO BUY anymore from this stockUNLESS guaranteed to be free for play in all country areasThis is a sorry event why would you buy a duckBEWARE !!!
2,'tis the reason to be dissatisfied,"It's sad for us Americans that the version available to us includes only two of the 4 Smurf's Christmas specials.Get a region-free DVD player and you can get copies from all over the world. The version released in Europe (world-wide) includes all 4 holiday specials (The Smurfs Christmas Special, 'Tis the Season to be Smurfy, Baby's First Christmas, and The Magic Sack of Mr. Nicholas).The total play time is over 100 minutes. If you get a region-free DVD player, you'll also be able to get all nine seasons of the Smurfs on DVD. You'll have to purchase each season separately. :(("
3,This jacket,"came and I had to send it back because they sent a size too big. I wish that I could've had it a size smaller than what I was ""told"" to order by their guidelines. I have a small English Cocker, and the medium (which is what their size chart said I needed) is way too long on him. It would be nice if it was a little thicker than what it is-- it's pretty thin. Other than that, it's reflective like they say."
3,"Maybe 75 Proof, But Not 100 Proof.","3 Stars = GoodComing on like North meets south, that is North = Texas, & South = Australia. The Four Horseman have been described as ZZ Top meets AC/DC, & that's a fairly adapt description, though other southern (American) rocks bands could be included.The Four Horsemen were an American band, & came out with their one & only album, ""Nobody Said it was Easy."" It's an album with cover art that mimics the raunchy roll inside. I myself have always been able to take or leave this band, but the song, ""75 Again,"" just kicks ass like nobodies business. The rest of the album is adequate. Just don't expect the next coming AC/DC or ZZ Top. This is just not the band. But, for those of you who find this style very appealing. ""Nobody Said it was Easy,"" is a sure fire piece of dynamite, with a short fuse. Get it while you can!"
4,Great kitchen set,My girls 2 1/2 & 4 1/2 LOVE playing kitchen & this set was a great addition at Christmas. They play with it daily & so far it's holding up really well!
3,Very small but still nice,"I was a little disappointed when this arrived and I realized how small it is. My daughter is 22 months-old and while the size is okay for now, I fear it will soon be too small. We also purchased the Melissa and Doug red wooden pots and pan set and were much more pleased with the size of that one. The teapot from this Alex set is a nice size but the rest of it is small for our liking. Our daughter enjoys it for now though and I guess that's what matters."
5,A Scholarly Revelation,Schaberg's viewpoint is profoundly and philosophically spiritual. The book makes an excellent Christmas gift for those who want to renew their belief in the deep spiritual meaning of Jesus's origins and his ascendance.
2,football blanket,"This was for a child's birthday, so he was happy. the logo image is nice, the fabric quality is terrible. it is thinnner than a kitchen towel and my guess is that it will pill up, shrink out of shape and the bright colors will run when washed. also, seller gouged pricing on the shipping, would not ship 2 together and the AMAzon website which promises to ship itmes together when ordered within an hour ignored this completely. the whole thing was a big rip off !!!!!!"
5,Great CD.,"This is a great BoDeans album. ""Good Things"" is on here. But don't just listen to this song, listen to the others as well. It's a great album, but I of course enjoy all BoDeans music."
4,Good things on this CD,"If for nothing else, get the CD for ""Good Things,"" which is a great song. There are some other gems on this one as well."
3,Fuf Chair,"I purchased the Fuf Chair for my granddaughter's birthday. My only regret is that I did not purchase a liner for it at the time of purchase. I was NOT aware you needed to do that until I recieved the item and read about it then. I really think it should be clearly indicated to inform the consumer that a liner purchase is optional PRIOR to purchase NOT after the fact. Also, I did not realize it needed to be ""puffed"" out for well over 24 hrs and I had to physically puff it out (it took at least 3-4 days) ahead of time for the actual birthday party. Again, she is pleased, but I wish I had purchased the liner then, as it is too late now that all the foam is scattered within the chair."
4,Nice Portable Tool Box,"I replaced an all metal toolbox with this Waterloo toolbox. Works just as well, and is easier on the sides of my car as far as scratches etc. I like the folding handle because i can stack this toolbox with other equipment and roll it all out to the car at one time. It's well built, and will likely last for years under normal usage. Plus it looks to me like Waterloo is an American company, so it is nice to buy something from an American company and keep at least some money recirculating in the USA."
2,"Good movie, but not the original like I thought","I thought I was getting the older version of this movie, but then I watched this one with my daughter, and it was not good like the old one. Oh well, it was cheap though!"
3,Kawasaki Light,"This seems to be a great light, but we hope we never have to use it for the reason we bought it - looking for navigation hazards in Prince William Sound while traveling at night. It hasn't been dark enough yet to see how far we can see over the water with it."
4,Not bad,"This light serves well for light duty, periodic use. If candlepower is your main goal, look elsewhere for 10-million; my previous 3 million candlepower seemed to be as bright as this one. The on/off switch could be better positioned for operability with the same hand that is holding the light.Overall this is a decent light for the few months I have used it."
2,Dim wit,"Nowhere near as bright as a lamp of this size should be - sent it back. there are others out there with more stars that work better.It also didn't hold a charge well... We couldn't figure out how something so massive, with such a huge reflector, and heavy battery could be so dim and die so quickly..."
1,Less than one Star.,"When I searched for a spot light on amazon, alot of people recommended the Kawasaki 10,000. Well, personal experience, dont listen to these review because its all lies. The Kawasaki 10,000 can not even compare with my old Dorcy 3000. I guess what you pay is what you get. However, if anyone looks for a bright and handy spot light, dont even think about the kawasaki 10,000."
1,JUNK,"waste of money poorly bulit, had to send the first on back because the battery would not charge,cost me $17.00 to send it back to shipper,second on does not work ratteling inside,junk from China."
3,way too much light!!,"This light is huge in size and in candle power. It's so big, it is limited to its use. When you turn this on, planes start circling your house. The ac charger that came with the unit did not work, I charge the unit with the 12 volt charger that fits into the cigarette lighter. It is well built, I have no idea how long one charge lasts, I havn't used it that long. My suggestion.............buy the hand held 1 million candle power at Lowes for $19.00"
3,Good luck on a replaement bulb,"I purchased this light for camping and walking my dog at night. When I first received it I noticed that it is the exact light listed on other websites for only $39.99 except it is Kawasaki green. I used the light that night and was pleased with the performance. They claim 10 Million CWP but seems about as bright as my 5 Million CWP hand held. It's still plenty bright and the shoulder strap makes it much easier to handle when walking. I use high performance head light bulbs in all my vehicles and know the life expectancy isn't that long, so I started searching for a replacement H4 40/80 watt bulb. Yes I said that correctly an H4 ""40/80 watt"". This is not a typical automotive bulb so you may be a bit challenged to find a replacement. I have found 55/100 watt bulbs that will fit, but this will just shorten the battery life. I'm going to contact All Trade to see about a replacement bulb, but I'm sure it will be cheaper to purchase a new light... I little frustrating."
2,"not 10,Million CP bright","the light is impressive, but the intensity of the light is compared if not lower than a 2,Million i have. seems the power is the same, but the lens design may provide better focus than an inexpessive 1,Million or 2 Mill that you will find at local dept. store. so dont expect much from the 10,million claim."
1,Poor Choice for the Money,"This thing never charged fully, would go dark after 10-15 minutes continuous. 10 Million never materialized. Now, the adaptor is pushing 25VDC, so say goodbye to this light.Save your money, buy a cheapie and you won't feel so bad when it too fails."
2,Parts available,How do you replaced a burned out bulb?The bulb in this Spot light is 80/40 watt a rating that doesn't seem to available.I HATE PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT HAVE SPARE PARTS AVAILABLE!
5,Home Run,This book knocks one out of the park. Dr. Tripp is a master of bringing scripture to bear on the details of daily life. The reader will find the true balm and nourishment of God's Word applied directly to the point of need.
5,A must for anyone over 40!,"I purchased the book at a conference several years ago. I thought it was about ""mid-life"" crisis and maybe I could use it to help someone else. Paul Tripp touches every aspect of aging, mental, physical, and emotional. I have bought the book for every friend I have over 40. I recommend it highly. It was delightful, insightful, and unbelievably encouraging to me."
5,Very Helpful,"This book was excellent. It was just what I needed to read at this time. It is helpful to know when other people have had the same thoughts and feelings as you are having or have had and didn't fully understand them. I would highly recommend this book to anyone middle aged or older whose kids have moved on and are retired and not sure what to do now. I see now that there are a lot of people that are experiencing these same things.There are also a lot of good examples of how others have handled hard times and turned them into something positive by trusting in the Bible, God's Word to us."
3,The Most Eciting Book Every!,"This book is a neat book to read.I liked this book because it changes a lot, like when you expect something to happen the opposite happens. I disliked this book because it was to discriptive. I would recommend this book to someone who likes very discriptive book."
3,Interesting but flawed,"If you love Baseball, and the larger than life personalities thatinhabited its early years, then you have to read this book.When you do, try to focus on the marvelous interplay betweencharacters like Satchel Paige and Dizzy Dean, while ignoringthe unnecessary and distracting subplots that a bettereditor would have excised. The author creates pricelessvignettes that, while fictional, paint what seems likea wonderfully accurate picture of a special time and place.With this book, those who wonder what Henry Ford thought of ournational pastime, or what color Carole Lombard died her pubichair, are in luck."
2,Couldn't get past the flaws,"Although I managed to read the whole book (I rarely stop reading a book once I have started - no matter how bad) I hard a hard time getting past the several mistakes and other flaws in the book. From the first chapter in which the spelling of the town of Ossage, Kansas varies between ""Ossage"" and ""Osage,"" I was on alert for more problems. It wasn't hard to find them. While other reviewers have mentioned that fans of baseball, especially baseball history, will enjoy this book, I found the several mistakes made it a frustrating read. True fans of baseball will have no problem picking apart the flaws in the description of the game played againt the black and white all star teams. Although I thought the premise of the book was interesting, I was disappointed in the book as a whole."
2,Very disappointing if you're used to other DK books,"I have a very high regard and fondness for DK children's books, but found this book to be extremely disappointing. Instead of featuring photos, it has 3D computer renderings...which leave a lot to be desired. There are dozens of much more impressive DK books."
1,"""Gruesome"" details can be traumatizing to a child...","Detail! Well, hold onto your stomach. My 9 year oldbrought the book to me and pointed out some things he didn't think heever wanted to see again. Small details that may otherwise be overlooked by a parent! Biesty has included illustrations of torture, including a gruesome depiction of someone being drawn and quartered. NOT for our family --- we took great pleasure in watching this title burn in our woodstove. My son felt partially vindicated by this ""old-fashioned"" book burning. Was this necessary, Mr. Biesty?"
1,Crawford's Superstore : Bait and Switch,"Hoya HMC - Filter - circular polarizer - 58 mmI am writing to revise a 5* review. Last week I purchased two Hoya 58mm HMC circular polarizing filters for my Canon 2Ti, through Amazon, from Crawford's Superstore. What I received was the cheaper, non HMC (blue box -- NOT silver box) filter, at the HMC price. I believe this is false advertising. I will NOT recommend Crawford's Superstore and will never again purchase from them -- unless they make good and exchange both filters I received for the higher quality filters they advertised and I expected to receive."
4,seems decent,"Seems good. I'm no expert on filters. It seems a bit dark to me and seems to make the colors more bland and grey, which it shouldn't, but maybe I don't know what I'm doing. Fits good and has good build quality. Glass seems very nice."
3,Faulty OA,Mine was broken on arrival. After some careful super glue applications it works just fine!I've had Tiffen filters but these HOYA's rock! Try get the SuperHMC or better series.
1,Terrible build quality,"I went through two copies of this filter and finally gave up and requested a refund. The snap ring that holds the glass in place was out both times and on one of the filters, the glass wasn't even edge-to-edge!! Terrible QA standards. I went to B+W filters and will never consider Hoya as an option again."
1,Warning These gloves fall apart,"I'm a sheet metal fabricator and I bought these gloves for their slash resistance quality, well after less then 4 hours use they started coming apart at the seams and the so called Kevlar couldn't stand up to sheet metal. These gloves are made in China and poorly made at that. I returned them to Blackhawk and so far all I've gotten is the old run around from them. My advice is DO NOT BUY THESE CHEAP GLOVES!!!"
3,Wasn't quite what I excspected,this is a beautiful book...but if your looking for training techniques you won;t find many. It about alot of bonding and understanding. Most of what you get from this book is that You really have to own the horse from birth to get across teh trust andbond thathe has with his horses. it's not somethign you can do withthe 10 year old you just bought.
5,Bret you've gotta stop drinking before your matches.,This was a great video of the 1997 Royal Ruumble.The matches were great and yes Stone Cold did cheat to win the Rumble but if Bret wouldnt of been drinking that canadian beer before the match Stone Cold would'nt slipped back in the Rumble to eliminate him but there is a good part though;Shawn Michaels wins the title from Sycho Sid in his hometown of Texas.
2,nothing special,"The best match of the day had to be the High Flying Mexicans' six-man tag team match (the crowd didn't get it), followed by the 30-man Royal Rumble (Austin is made to look like a headlining gladiator while the rest are reduced to imbeciles), and the endurance of Triple H in the Intercontinental title match versus Golddust. The Farooq vs. Ahmed Johnson script was all hot air and no moves, with exception to Ahmed's tasty powerslam on the table of one of Farooq's ""Nation of Domination"" people. Suprisingly poor was the Vader vs. Undertaker match. Neither of them really seemed to have their heart in it. And the heavyweight championship between Sycho Sid and Shawn Michaels really only highlights the former's problem as a beatable screamer. (Do you really think Michael's was gonna lose in front of his home crowd?) All in all, save your money."
4,Really fun game from 1990!,"I got this game in a lot of 6 racing games. When I got it, I thought it would be an awesome game. It is. The music sounds as if it was once an arcade game. I really like that kind of music. The racing is in a pipe, I have never played a game where you race in a pipe which is a nice variation to the usual. You can jump by pressing 'B', and use up to activate a power-up. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is you race alone with no CPU competition.Please buy this game. You will probably love it like I did."
5,Great Book!,"Awesome book, could not be better! Everything I could hav asked for. If this is wat u are looking for, buy it from here."
4,Aborted.,"I bougth this CD because I was in the store and remembered back in the day I knew someone who was deeply in love with Goremageddon. So I figured, okay, I'll try it out.I wasn't disappointed. Yeah, the guy uses hardcore screams in addition to the normal death metal growls, and a lot of the lyrics aren't as gory as I was expecting after reading the lyrics to Goremageddon, but whatever. There's still some nice demented stuff getting poured out, and a couple fairly humourous necrophilia songs(and where would any good death metal album be without one of those?).The music is pretty simple. There won't be anything absolutely rocking your head off, but you'll still be rocking to a worthwhile degree.So yeah, if you've got some money to spend, go for it.Everything here is great, though the hardcore screams take a bit to get used to. After that they just seem natural."
5,Excellent product,"I ordered these from a different company for a friend who is on crutches so that she could get around during a recent ice storm. She was already using YakTrax for traction on the ice; The addition of these crutch tip ice grips made it possible for her to navigate her slick, steep driveway to her car and to make it from the icy parking lot to her office. They're worth the price and more in terms of fall prevention. They are sold one by one so that people who just need one for a cane don't have to buy two."
3,Heres Lilly review,A 6th grader with a bad view on the world just cant see all quallites in life. Until Kathleen shows up a women from a modeling agency who offers Lily to join a modeling class. Lily has a great time there until the night before the modeling show something terrible happened. Ily realizes that all sheeve needed was a bit of God-confidence to make her fell good about her self.5/5 I could really relate to Lily and how she felt about her self. Its well writen and has a good meesage to it. I would definetly recomend it.
5,Here's Lily!,"Here's Lily is the first book in the Lily Series. They are great for girls who are entering Junior High School. It's about an eleven year old girl named, Lily Robbins, who wants to know who she is as a person. In this book, a lady from a modeling agency goes to Lily's school to teach them about good skincare and make-up. The lady (Kathleen), ends up picking Lily as a volunteer and, at the end of the lesson, gives Lily her card to see if she is really 'model' material. It goes through the problem between her and her friends and enemies. I recommend this book to any girl."
4,"""I can really relate it to life"" - Morgan","Lily Robbins gets picked on if only she had a miracle that would make Shad shifferdecker stop in his tracks. Then a Woman from a modeling agency comes, will Lily get her big chance? If she does what will her mother say about it? Where's God in this?A lot of questions are raised during the time that you read this book and after a while you start feeling Lily's emotions. Nancy Rue really did an awesome job of writting this book! I recomend this bok to all Christian girls! I really liked this book!"
3,Disappointed,"I bought this solely based on Richard Dorfmeister's name. I probably should have done more research and listened to it online, but I've got to say I was disappointed. I love Dorfmeister's remixes, but this wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting down-tempo dubbiness, but this is more like disco dub. If you're looking for mellow - this isn't it."
3,dorfmeister goes house and disco dub,"Quality production. An upbeat dancey production from Richard Dorfmeister, to compliment Peter Kruder's Voom Voom: Peng Peng album.If you're looking for dubbed out rolling basslines, jazzy dnb, and other k+d trademarks, they are not here though."
4,Great for sweaty people! Not for sensitive skin though.,"You sweat a lot?Gotta have these. Keep them in your car, take them camping, very refreshing.NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN. The description is incorrect.These have alcohol in them. Found out the hard way when I wiped my hands with these and tried to put in my contacts. OUCH!!!FYI, buy local. Should be cheaper."
1,sent wrong product,They sent the wrong product. Now im stuck for $55I ordered wet ones with vitiman E and aloe in the blueand white container they sent the green and white containerthey have different ingrediants and im allergic to the ones inthe green and white container.I will never order another product from amazon again
3,Not to happy.,"I dont know if shipping had something to do with this problem but when i gave this gift to my girlfriend on christmas the cover was falling off, some of the sleaves to hold the disks were damaged or just didnt even hold the disk at all. Just looked real sloppy wasnt to impressed. The disks looked to be in great condtion."
2,oc,the cover the cvc's came in was in very bad shape. most of the dvd's had fallen out and were scattered about in the box it was shipped in. the box it was shipped in itself was very battered. the first two disks were very scratched and will not even play very dissatisfied as this was a christmas gift.
5,fine,"I've always loved the show, sad that show had to end but nevertheless glad that I bought it. Very fond memories"
5,dam spoilers,"I rented the first disc of season one and liked it, so i decided to buy the whole series. Being a late comer there's bound to be alot of spoilers floating around. I accidentally read what happens to Marissa at the end of season 3 and that kind of ruined the whole series for me....But oh well, I might as well watch it because it's still a great show. Just knowing what happens at the end of season 3 sucks because I'm only on season one atm and i have to watch 3 seasons and i already know the outcome...omg...dam spoilers lolanyway the box set the disc came in is cool, and season one is remastered in 16:9 (1.78:1) format. great show"
5,oc 1-4,"I love the oc. it was brand new. i love the drama and excitement. there ae relationships, guns, drugs, and divorce. its crazy!!!!"
5,Favorite show from my late teens to early 20's,"I started watching this show when it debuted and I was a freshman in college. We would always invite the girls from our floor to watch it with us. The scenery and stories about ""life"" in California were a great escape for a bunch of Ohio people. As the seasons grew on and more friends were made, our OC parties started to get larger (and less about the show and more about the beer). If you're looking for a great way to escape the cold wintery weather and into some light-hearted teenage drama, this is definitely the show your looking for.The product itself is fantactic! A hard acrylic case protects the DVD's and the full color, fully descriptive book they come in. My only fault is that I can't find the show in friggin' Blu-ray!"
5,a must have DVD set for fans.,"I wouldn't pay over $100 for this box set but I'm very happy getting it through Amazon for $54.Considering that each season itself is usually over $20.The box set is a big book with pictures and 28 DVDs. Awesome presentation.If you're a fan of The O.C., I believe it's worth getting even though it's not Blu-Ray."
3,"Love the show, hate the packaging","The packaging for this product is TERRIBLE. Whoever designed it, did not take into account the banging it gets during shipping. The disks are slipped into a slot on a piece of cardboard (think a children's book, with slots in the pages) which do not hold the disks well enough to stop them from moving around during shipping. If you order this product, be sure to open and inspect it IMMEDIATELY. Five disks in my set had slipped out and were scratched to the point of not being playable and had to call for a replacement.And just to note, there's nothing Amazon can do about it. The fault is all in the manufacturer's packaging."
3,Love the show but hate the discs,I was very excited when the OC series went on sale and so I immediately bought it. I have been watching the seasons in a row and I am on Disc 10. Every disc so far has had at least one episode that it skipped almost the whole way through. I take the disc out to see if it has scratches or needs to be cleaned but I see nothing. I still clean the discs and yet they still skip. I absolutely love this series but am so disappointed with these discs.
3,Get's the job done,This was very cheap and delivered exactly what I wanted.... I wanted to watch all the seasons of the O.C. and I was able to :) The book was pretty neat too! The only thing I would say about it is that the way the discs are placed into the book is they fall out and can easily scratch. You have to be extra careful so that you don't scratch them but I am so this set was perfect for me
4,OC,The OC is a fun series to watch. It is so typical of California of the late 90's and into the 21st Century. The actors did very well and since I was working when the show originally came out I was glad to get it in DVD form.
1,Richie Havens works the Ramada Inn???,"What is this...Richie Havens does elevator music? Richie Havens works the Ramada Inn??? The voice is there, but the raw, driving, acoustic guitar and conga drums have been replaced with instrumental tracks, including synthesizer, that sound like Yani or Michael Bolton. The producer should be shot. If you're looking for the tracks on this album, find them on another release. ""Resume,"" however is great...the Richie Havens we know and love from the Woodstock era."
2,An Abysmal Recording,"I couldn't believe what I was hearing with this. I was so excited to hear Ritchie Havens perform the music of my 2 biggest influences...but I was sorely disappointed. What the other negative reviews have said are correct...that while the amazing voice is still there, the synths and drum machines are horrible.In my mind, the only 2 tracks that fully capture the true genius of Ritchie Havens are ""Working Class Hero"" and ""License to Kill""...which are stellar, and the only reason this got 2 stars instead of one."
3,Not so bad on re-listening,"Yep, the whole first half of this is plagued by booming keyboard synthesizers and 80s electronic drum tracks. I hated this when I first got it, disappointed by the production on what should have been this artist's best disc. But I re-listened today and it's not as bad as I once felt. The syn-drums finally drop out halfway through and you get to just guitar and congas on ""Working Class Hero"" and ""License to Kill."" The others, though hurt by the electro-drums, are still kind of fun, just like electric piano, the plague of the 70s, sounds kind of groovy in a cheesy way today. Richie should remix this, remove the synths and drums, and replace with acoustic instruments, and he would then have a gem."
1,OMG! WTF!,"Is my 21st Century opinion of what should be a great 1960s tribute. Richie Haven's rich passionate growl and thundering guitar taking possession of classic Beatle and Dylan music was what I was expecting. A shout out and howl to the 1960s, if you will. Little did I think that the most prominent musical era I would hear on this disc would be the artificially indulgent pop of the synthesized machine-drummed 1980s. I wonder if legal restrictions prevented Havens from playing his guitar while recording this music. Seriously, the cheesy synthesizers are a travesty. Hiring Bobby McFerrin to imitate synthesizers on these tracks would only be slightly less annoying. What a let down. What a bummer."
1,What a waste,"Driving home today I heard an interview with Richie Havens and he played a couple of songs including Here Comes the Sun. So I went on Rhapsody, and when I saw this album I figured that it would be great. It's awful. The only good songs are those that are simply Havens and his guitar. I had a strong desire to be sick when I heard If Not For You. Richie redo this one! I'm glad I had a chance to listen to it and was saved wasting money purchasing such a disaster."
3,Havens - not what you'd expect,"I was excited to order this item, only to find it had been produced in 1987 and was part of trying to move Richie onto another, younger, ""hipper"" audience. The ""Here Comes The Sun"" is NOT his hit single, but a re-do of the cover he orignally did in the sixties. All in all, I was disappointed in the overall sound and production of the songs, except for one or two Dylan tunes. Only for immense fans."
3,over priced,"Ordered wet ones antibacterial cloths and thought the price of $5.35 was for more than 1. Was surprised that the order contained only one. This is overpriced and deceiving because the advertisement says 5- 3/4 x 71/2, white , 40 wipes per dispenser. Makes it look like more than one. Could have bought this at a store for $2.49. Previously I bought wet ones from amazon contained 5 at a decent price. I will be more careful in ordering. Wet ones are a great product and I like using it in my office when a sink is not available. Just not a good price."
1,Exhorbitant pricing!!!,Why are these so expensive on Amazon? I use these on a daily basis and could never afford them at this price. I buy these at Walmart - 40 for $2.22 - regular price - The same goes for the individual packets - they are $2.25 per pkg of 16 from Walmart.
1,"$2.29 at Bed, Bath, and Beyond","$2.29 at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. $2.29 at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.$2.29 at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. $2.29 at Bed, Bath, and Beyond/"
5,lovely,i love this disc. i love the song Straight Up N****. I can relate to it. This is one of those cds that made rap seriously respected.
3,one great song,"""Midnight"" is one of the best rap songs ever, but the rest just doesn't hold up at all"
2,Ice T-OG (Original Gangster),"Ice It is one of the founders of the rap game, and if it wasn't for that, this cd would have gotten a 1, because I can't find ONE good song on here except for the intro called ""Home Of The Bodybag"" and that song is just so short. The sad truth is, i would just LOVE Ice-T if they put his cold hard voice to some nice BEATS! Get it?That's what he needs to make a really good cd, all the songs can't just be slow and mind numbingly boring."
1,Worthless,"First of all, let the record stand that I did not buy this album. A friend forced me to listen to it during a car trip. Arrggh.I can't figure out why people listen to this stuff. If I want the equivalent of this, I'll turn on the 6 o'clock news. That's depressing enough."
5,Good Stuff,"Great music for dancing.It has interesting slow foxrots and and faster foxtrots, whichwork well for American style dancing. There are also somereally different songs, which are good for American Rumba."
2,listen before you buy this!!,warning this album is all that was wrong with 80's metal. this album has no fire whatsoever i believe the first album and the last album of the band are 100% better i wasted my money on this album it has a little good riff and stuff but its all clich'e. there is definitley better albums to spend your money on.
4,Much different than the first album,"I just recently bought this album and when I first heard it I was a bit suprised to say the least. This album is 75% less heavy than their first release. The band really go for a more commercialized, melodic, lightweight AORish sound here. And you know what? I kinda like it! I mean this album doesn't have any where near the venom the first one did and it's not something I would blast on the cd player on a hot summer day but the thing I like the most about this record are the vocals of Mark Free. He really steps out and sings all of the songs very well as opposed to the first record where to me he sounds a bit hidden behind all the big drums and big guitars. I recommend this cd but be warned it's extremely different from the first one. If you want loud guitars and drums just stick with the first one. But if you want to hear the awesome vocals of Mark Free and you don't mind the music on the lighter side give this a listen."
5,The best album from KK!,"I REALLY liked this album rather than the previous because it is more light and melodic than Ready to Strike (first album). So, if you like heavy sound, drums being destroied, desperate screams and seeing your mother jumping through the window, this album is definetelly NOT for you. Now, if you like a soft rock, with very good vocals and extremelly melodic and well built guitar solos, go for it. This is not what we can call ""HEAVY metal"" album."
2,not good,"this album surely sucks. Its not even close to the first one. I don't understand why the second one sucked so bad. The second side of the first is close to this. Avoid this if you can. Mark had one of the best vocals in music, left and decided to wimp out. Too bad though. The person who decided to go for broke and change the sound should of been lead to the door off the bat. Stick to their first one. Its gold"
2,Weak overall effort with 2 gems,"Without Johnny Marr to compose and perform the music, Morrissey suffers noticeably. Here, ""Our Frank"" is a standout, one of Morrissey's best solo tracks (and with good, dramatic accompaniment), and ""Sing Your Life"" is likewise strong.Beyond that, however, the album is a dreary wasteland, with only 2 other even bearable tracks (""There's a Place ..."" and ""Driving Your Girlfriend Home""). Unlike some earlier reviewers, I don't feel that just because Morrissey sings it, it's automatically wonderful -- a good tune, varied instrumentation, and meaningful lyrics are also necessary (and too often lacking here)."
1,One of Moz' absolutely worst offerings,"Despite the passage of eight years since I bought this CD the day it came out, I just can't listen to it more than once a year. I remember how profoundly disappointed I was when I brought it home and listened to such drivel as 'Asian Rut' and 'Harsh Truth'. My roommate at the time knew how excited I was that the record was coming out, and I had to tell him that it was more awful than I could have imagined. The only good song is 'There is Place in Hell For Me and My Friends,' although the version on _Uncle_ pales in comparison to the live, uptempo version that can be found on the _Live on KROC_ EP. Go buy the latter instead of this album."
4,"Morrissey ""Kill Uncle""","I actually rate this cd at 4 1/2 stars, just a smidgen under 5. Although not Morrissey's best offering, there are some exceptional cuts here (OUR FRANK, SING YOUR LIFE, KING LEER, FOUND FOUND FOUND, TONY THE PONY). There are only 2 that I skip past when I play it and that I find to be the weakest tracks; Asian Rut and Mute Witness. I thought that this cd showcased his incredible vocal talents in a way no other album has. Morrissey isn't capable of turning out a bad record and although his lastest effort (Maladjusted) didn't fair well with the critics, there are some great tunes to be found on that cd as well."
1,God awful!!! I think I just threw up in my mouth,"I love Morrissey and The Smiths but this is the worst album Morrissey has ever released and quite ""frankly"" the worst album ever. The lyrics are terrible and the song arrangements are even worse. If it wans't for ""There Is a Place in Hell..."" there would not be a redeemable song on this disc. Quite simply, this is the worst thing Morrissey has ever produced. He can only hope it goes out of print and every copy of the disc is lost as well as all of the masters of the songs are lost except for the aforementioned. Terrible. Burn it in a bonfire--don't buy it. If anyone disagrees with this assessment of the album they are neither a Morrissey fan nor a person of minmal intelligence. If they try to defend this work then you might want to throw them in the fire as well. This thing resigns me to a Neanderthalish ""ugh."" Thank God he produced some brilliant albums after this or I would have begun to think there was place reserved in hell for him."
3,3.5 Stars,"I have to weigh in and say that this is a damn good record, not his best, but damn good. WAY better than his post-Vauxhall output. This, Bona Drag, and Your Arsenal make up what I believe to be Morrissey's post-Smiths glory years. He was still young and could back up all of his pretentiousness. The late nineties and 00's have proved that he is a bit of a parody of himself -- Not here.If ""Your Arsenal"" was his ""glam"" album (whatever that means) thab this was his, well quasi-retro album of sorts.It's usually anly about 8 bucks at Tower so pick it up if you are at all curious."
3,"A cluster of some very ""Morrissey-ish"" songs","Better individually then the sum of its parts. ""Uncle"" has some instant classics like ""King Lear"" but lacks the flow of a truly well laid album. More of a hunt and peck then a sit back and relax experience. ""Driving your girlfriend home"" is a brilliant anthem of the plight of the eternal ""friend"". Worth a try for the Moz fan."
3,ONLY THE ODD TRACKS ARE GOOD!,"I bought this album as a mistake. I meant to purchase ""Your Arsenal"" at a used cd store and I noticed when I took it home ""Kill Uncle"" was inside so I managed to check it out before I returned it, I think the highlight of this album was obviously Sing Your Life. I realized all of the odd numbered tracks are the ones I really liked. I think all of the even tracks in between were just thrown in to complete the album. I would give it a 2.5 because only half of the album is worth listening to."
3,this cd is okay,This cd is a good buy. Not morrissey's best attempt. this cd is still good. Has some really good tracks.
3,"Much-Maligned, but Only Somewhat Deservedly So","Almost sounds like one of Moz's latest B-sides, doesn't it? My title I mean...Why am I reviewing this? I don't really know, except the backlash against it has always puzzled me. ""Kill Uncle"" is a weird uncle, and certainly not a classic, but it's better than ""Maladjusted""!--and almost as good as ""Southpaw Grammar"", another polarizing release. ""Sing Your Life"" is marvelous; one of my first exposures to Morrissey...""Asian Rut"" is hilarious, unnerving, and completely singular. I like the silly resignation of ""King Leer"" and the spare archness of ""Driving Your Girlfriend Home"". Sometimes he sounds like he's 50 and full of holes on this one, and that's so touching in its strange, wintry way..."
3,Still testing,After much research this prop was to be the anser to my play toy towing issues. I have used this prop 3 times and still the jury is out. I do not know if I am getting the best performance out of my boat yet. More to come with the boating season coming to Arizona shortly.
2,Scale makes a great bookend.,"The product arrived promptly and there was no visible signs of damage. After reading the instruction sheet on how sensitive this scale is supposed to be, I came to the conclusion something had to be miss wired or? I have yet to return the scale, but this request for a review will prompt me to do so."
4,Nice inexpensive scale,"I bought this brand of scale because it was recommended in an article by Jill Santopietro in a column written for the New York Times. So far I find it easy to use, fast acting as ingredients are added or subtracted, and best of all consistent in the weight it calculates. I can't attest to how accurate it may be not having reference weights to test it with. I should give it 5 stars but at $28 there probably are costlier scales with greater accuracy which I could not justify buying but would love to have."
4,"Nice, affordable scale","This digital scale is easy to use and easy to clean. I use it in the kitchen but also to weigh my young macaw and pool chemicals, mail, etc. It has an auto shut off which is great since I usually forget to manually turn it off. It weighs in grams, ounces or pounds. I am very impressed with the quality for the price I paid for this scale."
4,"My Weigh KD-7000 Digital Stainless-Steel Food Scale,Black","This was a gift for my husband's birtthday. He was wanting one to process deer sausage and ect. We have not used it yet, but he was very proud of it. Very accurate when experimenting with or playing with."
3,Don't like cover,"This scale works pretty well, although I was weighing some chocolate for making truffles this Christmas, and the weight on the scale did not match the weight printed on the label for the chocolate.I do not like the plastic cover, as you have to lift it to push the button to turn it on."
5,Beth,"If you are interested in the historical, philisophical, and cultural dimensions of Paganism, Clifton's book is the best on the market. Relevant to Wiccans, Reconstructionists, Hermetics, and everything in between, this book will add real depth and color to your spiritual practice. The Paganism Reader is a lovely alternative to academic works about paganism written 'from the outside.' Chas Clifton is Pagan himself and is sensitive to our issues and experiences. An excellent book!"
1,Vista users BEWARE,"I bought this as a secondary card for my new Vista computer (running multiple monitors). Didn't settle well with the nVIDIA card already installed. So, i researched it a bit and found alot of Vista users having problems with this card and many many other ATI cards.Vista buyers beware!"
5,Adds depth to the classic monsters of the game,"Here it is... one of the rarest books in the AC series, complete and intact! This in-demand sourcebook features wonderful mini-adventures for all of the classic dragons (Black, Gold, Green, Opal, Red, Ruby, and White) and the most famous giant clans (Cloud, Fire, Frost, Hill / Mountain, Stone, and Storm). Each encounter is well-thought out, creative, and challenging; but what's more, each one also offers *exclusive* lore on the featured creature! You'll only find it here. The inside folder is a beautiful illustrated relative size chart of all the species - a classic."
2,Bad Accessory Bad Adventures,"Maybe a third of the adventures are alright, most of the rest are ridiculous. I don't think the book gives any REAL insight into dragons or giants. If you are in the mood for some silly short adventures then you might be alright with this product, but otherwise you'll hate it."
1,For old Mac book Pro,"This item does not fit the new 17"" Mac Book Pro. Perhaps it would save customers some time and a trip to the post office to know this."
4,Very nice fit and looks good.,I really like this product. Fits very good and doesn't really alter the appearance of my MacBook Pro.Seems to provide very good protection.Only thing is - I worry a little bit about heat buildup.Kirk
4,it protects,"since grey is not my favorite color, i love how u can choose different color for this and i chose black and it look really nice. also protects my computer :0)"
1,"Didn't fit my new MacBook Pro 17""","I have the most recent MacBook Pro 17"" laptop and the case didn't fit my computer. The holes for the ports were in the wrong place and I wasn't able to open or close my laptop. It would have been a great addition to my system, but perhaps my system it too new, and the updated cases haven't come out yet. I will try again at a later date."
1,Horrible case,"My experience with this case was completely horrible. As soon as I put this freaking thing on my computer, I had nothing but problems. The macbook would get really really hot and it kept freezing up. Once I removed the case the problem went away."
1,Overheated Battery Warped - Required Replacement,"There are no holes in the casing to allow airflow at battery. It took a year, but the heat buildup warped the battery's metal casing. A replacement battery cost $125.00 which brought the total cost for using this shiny case to $150.00. Do not buy this product. If you already own it, remove it now from your beautiful 17"" Macbook Pro."
3,Decent product,"I have this hard case for a month now. It is pretty sturdy and attaches pretty well on my macbook 17"" If only the rubber feet are maybe a couple more centimeters higher so the heat escapes better. For the price though it is worth the buy."
5,Good Protection,"Before I purchased the speck hardcase I carried my laptop in a padded zip up canvas type case that fit in the backpack it came with. My laptop still incurred dents and damage from just setting the backpack down. since I bought the hardshell I have no more worries about denting the fragile aluminum casing that the macbook is made of as well as it gives the laptop a unique look. The casing does not add too much bulk to the laptop and it is easy to put on and remove. the only problem I had was with it was the price, $50 was a little pricey but overall the hardshell is a success and I would suggest it to anyone who asks."
5,Excellent!,"I bought this case for my husband's 17"" MacBook Pro... It really protects your computer for crashes and dirty... And also, he's really happy 'cause almost nobody has this special blue aqua color... It makes it Unique!"
1,POOR DESIGN,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 17"" MACKBOOK PRO i7 MODEL. THE SIDE PORTS DIDN'T EVEN LINE UP, ALSO WHEN I DID GET IT ON, THE TOP HALF SNAPED OFF EACH TIME I CLOSED THE LID.THIS DID NOT FIT MY MACKBOOK PRO 17"" AT ALL.I RETURNED IT FOR A REFUND."
4,Fits perfectly,It fits perfectly and is useful to protect against minor dings. It even adds an attractive shine to the MacBook Pro. The only drawback is the case will limit how wide you can open the screen.
4,Awesome product,Very awesome product. AntOnline is a great company to order through. Fast delivery! Will order from again!
1,"After two years this product may gradually break the screen casing, good company though","Length:: 1:08 MinsUPDATE: I was ultimately able to find an authorized Mac repairer that fixed the damage under my apple care at no cost to me. Also, I spoke with Speck products and though I still find this product a bit poorly conceived, the company was EXTREMELY helpful and willing to help out. So I have no problem giving Speck, the company, a positive recommendation. It's nice to see a company that will stand by their product - a rarity nowadays.Everyone who is thinking of buying or has bought this product needs to see this review. The Macbook Pro is not designed to take any pressure from opening the screen against the dark grey outer edge. This product creates new pressure points that can gradually cause severe damage over time."
2,Some Like It Hot?,"I'm not so sure it's a good idea to cover a MBP with one of these. By nature, the Macbook's aluminum casing keeps it cool, but with the Speck case hugging the surface so tightly, I found my own machine to get quite warm to the touch after just a few minutes.Despite what Speck says, plastic cannot breathe."
4,Great Product!,"I just wanted to take a moment to say that this product is very well made, and amazingly precise in its fit of my 17"" MacBook Pro. I'd recently purchased another Speck cover for my wife's new MacBook Air, and had been impressed with that, so I was hoping this would indicate a similar fit for my computer, and it was. Some folks have said they were not thrilled with the limited opening of the screen, but the screen opens 120+ degrees, which is as far as I opened my screen even before the Speck was put on. The temperature issue may be problem in the long term, but the plastic will certainly do some level of conduction (the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars), but my thought is that it's worth protecting this very expensive laptop. I'd highly recommend these cases. By the way, for those who are 'into' the Mac look (brushed aluminum), the clear case doesn't get in the way of the beauty of the machine at all."
4,Finally!,"Well, Finally after all the other previous books in the Death Gate Cycle, many of the seperate storylines are starting to get wound up like never before. The previous book, ""Hand of Chaos"" starts to do this but just does not quite have the action that this one did.You finally get a look at what goes on inside the Labrinth itself. No longer are the dwellers just from one of the character's memories. Now you actually get a big feel for what is soon to happen with the sundered worlds.....I will not say that this has been the best I have read in the series so far. I still cannot decide whether ""The Fire Sea"" was better written. Either way, it is a great book if you have read (at least 2 of the other) Death Gate novels."
5,Excellent business communicat. text relevent to 21st Century,"Book is divided into four easy-to-read sections: relational life, work life, public life, and techno-life. Addresses such topics as listening, communication styles, workplace diversity, leadership, business etiquette, public speaking, stress and conflict, and computer technology. Handy reference for every day use. Toolboxes in each chapter provide self-analysis check list on various business communication topics. I highly recommend it for classroom, business, and for personal use."
4,New JD Songs,"I purchased the CD to get some Joy Division songs I hadn't found elsewhere. Although the quality is excellent overall, the live versions do lack in audio quality, which is a shame."
4,Official bootleg,"Still was the late answer of the record company to the rising amount of bootlegs of JD in the 80s. I'm glad they released this stuff, because most bootlegs were of very poor quality. Still is for the real fans. I like it a lot, though it's not a very consistent record. JD's cover of Velvet Underground's Sister Ray is magnificent. And the live versions of the well known songs are powerful and manage to grasp you by the throat. It's just a shame that Ian Curtis wasn't there anymore to give his opinion on this compilation."
5,Joy Division's odds and ends with live performances,"This album was released after Ian Curtis died in 1980. The album consists of tracks left over there were never released on any of their albums at the time (until heart and soul was released). This album is split in two parts the first 9 tracks make up the stidio outtakes and tracks 10-20 were all live and are not available elsewhere at least not to my knowledge. I quite liked the cover of Velvet Underground's Sister Ray and at the end Ian declares ""you should hear are version of Louie Louie"". This contains what I think is the only known live recording of Ceremony performed by Joy Division before they became New Order and recorded the song. This is just my own opinion but I still think that this is ""STILL"" essential to purchase and the live tracks are worth the price alone."
2,Tom Rips Us Off,"Please! We wait 5 years for a new album from this guy, and he gives us a 10-track, 30-minute CD. I haven't felt this screwed since Johnny Mathis' last Broadway album (similarly low on running time).Oh, well. At least Tom's diction is has improved. To make out the words on ""Two Chairs"" (his own song, for God's sake!) from his last CD, I had to go and buy the CD of another singer (the very good Tom Michael), who did a beautiful (and intelligible) rendition."
5,"Same Sex: Debating the Ethics, Science and Culture of Homosexuality","For those who are not satisfied with simple answers, this will surely provoke you to endless months of deep reflection."
1,Missing Watch in Package,"Terribly shocking for me. When I received my package from UPS, the whole Omega Watch is missing. The Omega Watch box is not sealed at all. Only the UPS box is sealed up. Now the Amazon customer service needs me to make a police report in my country, fax them my police report, then they will investigate to assist me further."
5,Amazing!!,"I found this foundation at Whole Foods and fell in love with it! Because let me just say that I have extremely oily skin so most foundations tend to react weird with my skin, it just doesn't look right. Most foundations make my skin look cakey, but not this one. I love this foundation so much! I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
5,Musical Mastermind,"Richie Havens is a folk music mastermind. He is unreal. This is an incredible album that lacks only one thing, supply."
5,Very Nice,"Bought a pair of these as an Xmas present for the folks and they are great. They look great (we're from Buffalo), are nice and heavy, and are very warm. I will now buy more from this company (first purchase was chiefly based on the pattern) after being able to see firsthand how nice they are. Very well done edge work and comes well-packed in a presentation box with certificate. Good size as well. Only drawback is that wool is dry-clean only, but at the same time wool is very resistant to any odor/spill/stain and we really only needed to clean them a couple times over the winter season (we actually didn't need to but decided it would be a good idea about once every 6 weeks or so). If you spill a lot or have messy kids, these may not be for you but if you can keep them clean there is just about nothing better than a thick wool blanket."
4,classic soul,I recently purchased this cd again. I once owned it on cassette.Keith is a real smooth old school type singer and his music andsound has sustained very well since it was released in the early90's. If you are building an old school collection with greatsingers this is a good one to have. It's great for romance orwith that special lady. Jaye Pricebeltsville md.
4,Gives Luther Vandross a run for his money.,"This was simply a great album from beginning to end. Keith really puts his heart and soul into these songs with ""All Night"", ""Lovers After All"", ""Closer"", ""Kissing You"", ""When You Love Somebody"" and the ultra-sexy title track being among the smoothest ballads recorded during the 1990s. Although his successes have been almost exclusively on the R&B charts, ""Make Time For Love"" shows Keith has the potential for superstardom."
5,It's About Time!,"This book is a wake-up call for marketing and sales organizations. The old ways of going-to-market are no longer effective in today's business environment.John Coe clearly understands the new sales paradigm and what it takes to be successful. He shows readers what it takes to:- Break through the marketing clutter and get noticed.- Obtain high quality leads and convert them to sales.- Create and execute an effective campaign.From the very first page of this book, I was hooked - and I'm a pretty discriminating reader. As someone who specializes in new product launches, I'm pretty cynical about most books since they just keep regurgitating old, time-worn strategies and tactics.This book is different. Well worth the investment.Jill KonrathCEO, Leapfrog-Strategieshttp://www.Leapfrog-Strategies.comFounder of top sales portal:http://www.sellingtobigcompanies.com"
4,Fig Rig Clamp,"For what it is...it's expensive.For what it does...it's priceless.I gave it only 4 stars out of 5 because of it's price though.This is a very versatile clamp for mounting equipment around the periphery of a Fig Rig stabilization platform by Manfrotto.With a quick plate mounted to this clamp, you can pop your entire rig setup on and off of your tripod as the need arises.Anodized aluminum and strong. A fantastic accessory for your Fig Rig."
4,A Keeper,"Kern Fellingham mistook Jemma for her sister an actress, Christine. Kern kidnaps Jemma and takes her to a tumbled down hut. For punishment he makes her clean up the hut.Christine is having an affair with Kern's nephew. Christine is being evicted, and she would do almost anything to stay in the apartment, so Kern promises her a lease if she will go with him.She goes and Kern soon learns she isn't a self centered selfish money hungry harpy.He learns Christine is loving and kind, as well as beautiful..Then he learns she is Jemma not Christine.He loves her and he wants her to love him.I feel Susan Fox, the late great Betty Neels, Rebecca Winters, and Helen Brooks."
3,US Marine Corps Pacific Theater of Operations 1943-44,"This booklet is part of an entire series. I have no problem with the quality of the written material, however the publishing company did a mediocre job in the printing. Some of the printed pages are very light and hard to read. Photos in the book are very light and the source of the photo, (a USMC photo) the author does not source! Even when he does, the text is so small and light that it is unreadable. This booklets are published by Osprey Publishing."
5,Bananza,I didn't order this as of yet I just wanted to know if season 1 0r 2 has the episode of where Hoss hides in the Coffin and the townspeople almost mistakenly bury him. I can't recall the name of this one but it sure was funny I would like to get that one plus all the others I love Bonanza.
4,"Great inside look at the ""Wiescamp horses"".","Hank Wiescamp ultimately breed some of the greatest horses from four registeries - Quarter, Appalossa, Palomino, and Paint. ""The Hank Wiescamp Story"" allows the reader to understand how and why Hank made many breeding decisions to create the great ""Wiescamp horse"". After this book, you too will appreciate what Hank Wiescamp has done to create many of the modern breeds.Hats off to Hank...... Highly recommend this book for all. Pictures, pedigrees and stories. However, 207 pages could not begin to touch the surface of the 70 years it took to create the ""Wiescamp horse""."
5,Works fine for me,"I've had this motherboard for several years with no problems. Judging from other people's reviews, though, I guess it's hit or miss."
1,A Dud!,This motherboard failed after only 5 months... save up and buy a Gigabyte motherboard it's worth the price.
5,Can't put it down!,"The author intelligently and thoroughly guides you step-by-step through the directing process. I learned a lot by his scene analyses of a few popular films. Great book, very much worth it!"
2,"Those Who Can, Do","This might be a good book for people who've never seen a movie. But Proferes has almost no actual professional experience directing a film (his IMDB listing is all ""special thanks to"" stuff) and I think that his advice is mainly academic. Save your money and rent some DVDs by real directors."
1,"So expensive, Maxitears works same and better price",Title says it all. This is way too much money. I have dry eyes and been taking fish oil and needed something more complete. Maxitears was recommended by Amazon so I tried it and love the product. Better price as well.
1,Theralife eye review,I have been on this product for about 2 weeks and really have not felt a difference with it. As of right now I would not recomment this to anyone with severe dry eyes.
1,Sick to my stomach and nauseous!,"I bought this product direct from the manufacturer and I could only take it for 3 days. It made me sick to my stomach. I felt like vomiting during the day and it was terrible. I had Lasik too 9 years ago and I'm taking 6 different supplements together and now my eyes are great. As for this product, never again, it went directly to the garbage."
3,Overall good information,"I've read nearly every title out there on web hosting, and Carl Burnham's book is an informative read. Yes, it's a little simplistic in approach, but I don't think he wanted to take for granted that you knew everything there was to know before reading his book. If you did, why would you need to read the book? If you're going to read this, also get The Complete Web Hosting Kit Professional by Ken Joy. It not only contains a complete how-to guide, but also comes with the web hosting and e-mail software ready to use out of the box."
2,Rather simplistic,"I found this book to be overly simplistic; it does not go into much detail in any area. As I will be joining a Web Hosting company, I was looking for something to get me up to speed on this subject. Unfortunately it is mainly general advice in here, and not the nitty gritty I was looking for."
3,One Song,I purchased this CD for one song Kissing You. I really didn't care to much for the rest of the CD once I listened to it.
3,Does a good job but burns out fast,"This brush is terrific for the hair but the durability is extremely poor lately. I have been using this brush for years and the first one I bought lasted for several years. Now they give out and stop working in less than a year. The last one I bought in May, 2012 and it has already stopped working. Since it is guaranted for a year, I am returning it for a replacementt."
2,too weak to do any good,"so weak, it barely styles my hair. Of course, I opened it to try it, so now I am up the creek."
3,Nothing fancy - but it works.,"I have fine hair & it works great for me but this doesn't have a lot of power so if you have thick hair, it may not be the right one for you."
2,Don't buy it.,"This hot air styler is pretty much a waste of money...I have longish wavy hair and it doesn't do a thing for it...the brush doesn't even get hot enough..it's barely warm, it's a crappy products..don't buy it."
1,Did nothing for me,"I purchased this item hoping to love it after using a similar one at a friend's house. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. It did absolutely nothing for my hair. I don't have very much hair and it isn't thick at all. I wish I could have returned it. I tried it on dry hair, damp hair, and towel dried hair with no success. I guess I will continue my quest with a different brand!"
1,"No heat, no air",This is NOT a 2-in-1 styler. It's a ZERO-in-one. There is no heat and no air. Might as well use a regular brush and blow on it yourself.Do NOT buy this! I threw mine away.
2,Not hot enough,"Takes too long to dry my fine, curly hair. I would like it much better if it were hotter."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM GOODMAN'S BECAUSE WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS NOT WHAT YOU GET. I ORDERED THIS AND THEY SENT ME A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ITEM AND WHEN I CALLED ABOUT IT THEY SAID THE ONE THEY SENT WAS THE ONLY ONE THEY HAVE WHICH IS NOT THE ONE THAT IS LISTED. THEY DO NOT EVEN CARRY THE ONE THAT YOU ARE SEEING BUT THEY HAVE IT LISTED. THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING. IF YOU WANT THE ONE YOU ARE SEEING THEN GET IT SOMEWHERE BESIDES GOODMANS
2,Not what I wanted,I have used a curling blower drier for years. As they have worn out I have replaced them at the local department stores. They no longer carry much of a selection. So online shopping I have went. This brush comes with 2 brush sizes. The smaller size has hard bristles like I prefer but it is too small. The larger size I did want has soft bristles that don't work to curl the hair. Top the bottom drawer it goes. You know that drawer that you put everything you probably won't ever use but since you paid good money for it you hate to throw it out at least for a year.
1,Dont waste your money,Dont waste your money. It barely heats up. The hard brush attachment is plastic and doesn't even get warm. It's a horrible product.
1,Waste Of Money and Time,"This Product Did Not Work For Me I Have Long slightly Wavey Hair And I've Tryed To Curl it Dry, Wet, Half Dry and Wet, Nothing happened I've Even Tryed Hair Spray and Gel to get it to work Still Nothing. So I Tryed It On My Cousin who has short hair Nothing Happened Still. It's a Waste of Money and a Waste of time. the Big Brush Doesnt Work well and the small brush Would Rather Tangle you're hair when unraveling the curl then curl it at all. I Bought it on sale at Target. Lady's This Is A Piece Of JUNK Don't Waste You're Hard Earn Dollars on This Mess."
2,I wouldn't bother buying this item.,"I have used this item a few times & I must say that I do not like the way that it works on my hair. I have shoulder length hair that I have been told is ""thick"". The size of this curling brush is not good for the length of my hair. I actually owned a Conair hot air styling brush/hot iron that worked much much much better...unfortunately, this company no longer makes that particular item any more. A huge disappointment for me. I would suggest passing on this item if you have my type of hair...."
4,"Hilarious, dark, twisted, and beautiful","Alternating between hilarious and suspenseful, Desire & Hell at Sunset Motel is a compulsively watchable film with a complex plot -- THE USUAL SUSPECTS meets THE HONEYMOONERS. Full of great lines and strange characters, it brings ordinary people -- a salesman husband, a wife who just wants to go to Disneyland -- into a world of amnesia, double-crosses, and sensual temptation. The 1950s details are flawless, and the film's rich visual texture keeps you watching. The plot's complexities are resolved in a stunning surprise ending.If you liked BLUE VELVET, EATING RAOUL, or almost any movie by David Cronenburg, you'll enjoy this film."
3,The flour needs to get a little clearer.,"THe flour gets kind of black when u cook it. When I cooked it, my fufu ended up grey instead of white."
1,This book discriminates,"This book is biased and discriminates against gay parents and the average blue collar worker who can not afford much. YOU DO NOT SAVE MONEY with this book. There are no coupons, no deals, no information on how to save money.[...]"
2,What Happened???,I am having my second baby in January. I found the older version of this book to be much more helpful and sensible. Perhaps they are trying to cover too much but even having some experience this new edition was rather confusing and often said one thing in one place and something different in another. I think this time around I'll go to a store that has many things for baby and rely on my common sense.I recommend if it's your first pregnancy to talk to other moms.
5,The best baby book.,I thought this book was very infomative. It helped with a lot of my purchases. I would recommend it to evryone I know.
4,HUGE-Use it for DJing,"I honestly winged it when figuring out how big this was. It is quite the box, if I could go back I migh have gotten one size smaller. But regardess I can throw endless amount of wires in it as well as anything else. It has wheels that allow you to roll it and a handle as well. Waterproof is nice touch when unloading in rain, great product."
2,Buyer beware,I bought this product specifically because the label reads granules. It was in powder form not granules which is more difficult to spread as it cakes in the spreader. It is possible it was in granule form at one time a long time ago. I spread it on my grass and hope it works okay. That is all I want this product to do. Buyer beware.
5,A must read,"Scott Cunningham is such an amazing man, this is one of my favorite books by him. If you do not own it, you should definitely add it to your collection. I wish there were more like him!"
2,doesn't do it for me,"I eat a ton of eggs. I like to fry them, so it's important for me that the spatula itself be sturdy, but that the tip is flexible so that it can slide underneath the egg without breaking it. I guess I didn't read the other reviews carefully enough, but looking at the picture, I thought that was the case. In fact, the entire turning part is made of a hard plastic. It's still possible to flip eggs with it, but they don't turn out nearly as nice as with my old turner, which recently broke. In addition, the first couple times I used it, the egg was sticking to it, making it difficult to make scrambled eggs as well.The construction of the turner itself seems sturdy enough though; if you're looking for just a hard piece of tapered plastic on the end of your turner, you should be fine with this one. If you cook eggs, I'd go with something else."
2,Not actually heat resistant,The product description claims that it is heat resistant yet the edge of the spatula melted a bit after normal use and started to flake. I had to scrape off the loose plastic. Now I'm very careful not to expose it to heat for very long.
3,It's okay is a great description,"I bought this pretty much so I could flip fried eggs, that was basically the only job I wanted it to do. It doesn't really do it that well. It's not that flexible, quite thick and not wide enough to really do a good job flipping eggs. For other things it's fine, pancakes seem to work well with it. The quality is good, it's not a bad tool but it's not quite what I had hoped for either."
4,Spatula,"This is lightweight and has a wide end so it's good for eggs, hash browns and really anything. Handy even for baking."
2,GREAT TRIBUTE TO KOSMOSKI!,"This book was designed around the ego of Jon Kosmoski, and most of the book is designed to glorify and promote his Kolor House line of paints, and there are very fgew secrets to be had. If you are interested in Jon Kosmoski's life history and the millions of dollars he has made with his Kolor House Paints, then it is great."
2,Commercial for House of Kolors,"If you use PPG paint, there's nothing there for you. They make painting sound so complicated that you'll want to take your car to a shop. Constantly mentioning supplied air respirators etc... When have you ever seen a painter in a scuba outfit? I know the fumes aren't good for you, but come on!"
2,House of Kolor Advertisement,"Overall the book didn't flow well. For instance, there were pictures on pages that the text didn't relate to. It did have some good tips but it probable should have been titled ""How To Paint With House Of Kolor"" than anything else. It definitely would have been better if he had used generic materials instead of House Of Kolor this and House of Kolor that."
2,"OK, but not the best","This book contains some good information. Although, it is not put together well. It seems to lack focus and doesn't flow well. There may be a picture on page 3 and the author discusses the picture 5 pages later."
3,a little aggrivating,"This part took a little modification to fit even though the year, make and model matched. Not a big deal unless you find it under the engine at the time you realize the modifications necessary! Specificaly the bolt holes needed to be opened up wider."
2,bad,"This game is a dissapointment. But when I bought it I wasn't expecting much. The controls are terrible. How could anybody read the cockpit instruments? The grapics are ok but the pixelation isn't all that great, the worst part as that this doesnt have training. If you want a good sim get USAF."
1,Great concept but needs work,The graghics are great and the concept is appealing but after reading War & Peace to get the gest of how to operate this sim for 4 day's I was looking forward to enjoying the time in the skies over Korea. However between the Ilegal operations and the lock ups the enjoyment faded to frustration. Back to EAW until this sim is debugged!
3,Poor graphics as an old game ..,As an old game; you will not be happy with the graphics .. but you may still have fun...
4,Mig Alley Puts You There,"Mig Alley gives a good feel of actually being there. It's also jets and guns, so you get up close, rather than missles. The flight model is good and you can fly close to the ground without crashing as you do in several other combat flight sims. The sounds are good and the graphics are more than adequate."
5,Great Sound!!!,"Amazing sound, I didn't believe Sony can make it in automotive sound, but now I think is one of the best in this area, clear and powerful with high quality, No doubt, I recommend it!!"
4,A helpful book,"Webber's Planning Blended Worship is very helpful and practical for the pastor and worship team that is moving from a traditional/contemporary to blended worship. It gives excellent background information on the purposes of worship, and discusses three types of worship---traditional, contemporary, and blended. While this is helpful, I did find that I wished often as I read that the author would spend more time on ""blended"" and less on the other two types. After all, the title is ""Blended Worship"". Checklists are given and have some validity, but are vague at times. This was a helpful book for me as our church moves from a traditional service and contemporary service to only one ""blended service."" I would recommend it."
3,His Capitol best ofs are better,"OK, Francis Albert Sinatra is probably the greatest singer of the 20th century. Nothing will change that.However, 'The Very Good Years' represents the Voice in decline. The bulk of material on this cd, Frank covered in the 50s at Capitol Records, and, to me, those are the definitive versions. Frank was at the height of his powers, and had invented, yes INVENTED, to concept album during that period.""Strangers in the Night"", ""Summer Wind"", ""My Way"", ""That's Life"", and ""Theme from New York New York"" are the reasons to get this cd. Those five songs are right up there with his Capitol glory years. They're why I own it."
2,Another one gone from the face of the earth,"But it's a damn good thing, `cause I never liked this so-called ""legend."" He's a glutton. He never could sing (no offense to his casual fans). And it's no surprise that he sold millions of albums. Guess who wants to sing his music now?Andrea Bocelli.I'd LOVE to see that `cause Andrea can sing his a** off. Case closed."
5,Sinatra Is The Man,"I listen to mainly rock but this is a fine collection of music by a man who set a standard with standards. Sure this album goes through the 60's quickly gets to the 1970's but I really enjoyed his Reprise years over any other period of his singing. So depending on your taste, this is a winner one way or the other. I highly recommend getting this one.Search for our site Judemac Forever on msn,Google or Yahoo."
2,Poor reproduction,"Accepting money for such a dismal product as this should be a crime. Sinatra would roll over in his grave if he knew this was being marketed.It's tinny, it's thin, and the selections makes one wonder who decided these were the ""Very Good Years"". Tag this item so you won't make the same mistake that I did."
5,That's Life,"I must disagree with my fellow Chicagoan. I think ""That's Life"" is a fantastic song simply because it is a bit of a break from the Sinatra ""style."" Everything else he said was right on target though. As a Sinatra ""beginner,"" this was the first CD I owned and still my favorite."
4,Wow!,"No one could go wrong with purchasing a Frank Sinatra CD, it is truly one of a kind even in this time!"
4,Very good intro to some very good years,"While I prefer Sinatra's Capitol years, his other eras are essential. This cd is a good starting point to introduce listeners to the seasoned, mature voice of Sinatra in his later years. Hits are many, and although the re-interpretations of earlier material don't always measure up to their predecessors, they are still essential. ""Fly Me to the Moon"" is possibly the standout track, but in a Sinatra collection, that makes it the very best of the best."
4,Relax with Sinatra,"How many singers can take a verse that wouldn't make sense and create a flowing work of art? Not many. What Louie Armstrong was to the trumpet, Sinatra was to singing...Incomparable."
5,Gone With the Wind lunch box,Cute lunch box! Gave this as a gift to my sister who loves the book. She was thrilled.
5,A Rare Find,"We grew up with Richard Scarry books, so when my brother adopted a young sibling group from Lithuania, I searched high and low to find him the prefect family gift and this was it! Our copies, which our mother still had, we worn from years of love and use, so to find this copy in almost mint condition (and to find it at all!) was lucky. It was packaged and shipped carefully. These are wonderful books for childern in homes with two languages I only wish they were more available."
5,Chilhood favorite...,"This was one of three ""Cowboy Sam"" books that my son-in-law enjoyed as a child and wished to share with his children. They all enjoyed reading them on Christmas day."
1,save your money,"This book is full of cliches and it has nothing orginal to say. It is double spaced with a big font, which means there are four spaces between each paragraphs. At the end of each chapter there are pages full of ""wise words from others"" which are usually worthless quotes he probaly got of a book of quotes.I didn't like it at all, it took me 15 minutes to read the whole and thing and I am just puzzled by why it is being sold. I am an avid reader of self-help, may be the author should be too."
1,Missing key information on Dodge Vans,"This book was dismal. The information provided is frequently lacking in key points (ie: (paraphrase)""The eight cylinder engine is like the six cylinder engine, so just extrapolate"". Furthermore, upon receipt of the Haynes manual covering the same vehicles, it became immediately apparent that the Chiltons manual had left out critical information. The wiring maps are incorrect, and/or missing details - not to mention other issues. A potential buyer would do better to track down the Haynes Dodge & Plymoth Vans manual - or the shop manuals."
3,You need more,"With every vehicle I have owned, I have always purchased a manual for repair. What I have found out is that you need both the chilton and the haynes manuals. Between the two you will get most of the info you need. The most comprehensive is the factory manual if you want to spend a lot of money. I can get most of what I need to do to repair my vehicles if I have both manuals."
3,A better tutorial,"This book should be given 3.5 stars, but since so many people gives 4 and 5 stars, giving 3 stars keeps a good balance.This book is definitely better than Microsoft's tutorial, but not so much better. Here are something I don't like about the book.1) The author does not have real industry programming experience, as can be seen from the coding style: no C++ except Microsoft's D3Dframework, lots of global variables, repeat D3dframework in every chapter (why not build a library), no functions to wrap common D3d functions.2) No thing much extra, for example how to display text properly in DirectDraw/Direct3D, how to draw a generic polygon, how to make DrawPrimitive as easy to use as OpenGL.3) Based on Microsoft's D3Dframe, which is only good for a demo program. D3Dframe is not a well-designed C++ library for Direct3D. It uses global variables, only allows single window instance, ... ZeroMemory is a Microsoft call, it's normally slower than memset because it's not inlined."
2,Poor attempt,"This book will only be useful for total D3D newbies. It's actually less useful than the D3D SDK Help docs, since everything here uses the framework library, whereas there is at least some tutorials in the SDK that don't. Honestly, no one wants to know how to program using the framework library, you'll never learn anything that way. Can't say I'm surprised though, having read this authors previous books, and there's no way you can teach D3D in 500 pages so I should have know better. Andre Lamothe's latest book is far better, even for newbies."
4,Now needs updating. Based on DirectX7.,"Reviewing is difficult because we all know graphics and/or programming at different levels. I am experienced in both computer graphics and MFC/C++.The full examples, and description of the framework, are listed in the text. That's good. The CD-ROM is very good and gives all examples.However, I'm working on a DirectX8 program, and the samples won't compile under DirectX8 (MS says code is supposed to be backward compatible). In addition, the examples keep looking for a joystick. I don't have, need or want a joystick. Aparently if you don't have a joystick, it's an error. :-)"
1,Disappointing,"If you're looking to learn Direct3D get Jim Blinn's Corner : ""A Trip Down the Graphics "" to learn about the 3D pipeline, its much cheaper and explains 3D, something which this book doesnt. this book doesnt explain much of anything,I suggest you read the MSDN Direct3D documentation instead of reading its summary in this useless book."
3,Basically SDK documentation rehashed,"I was disappointed with the book in that, for the most part, it just rehashes the SDK documentation. Like all other books written about DirectX (especially Direct3D), it left me desiring more. If you're just looking for a book that explains the DirectX framework that Microsoft includes with the DirectX 7.0 SDK, then this book does a nice job."
3,It works for me,"This is maybe my fifth book like this, and it has been one of the most useful. Usually I buy a book and its material gets outdated fast (ray casting, retained mode, etc.).I like this book because I already know all of the concepts in it, and I just need to see how to do them quickly.Still, the book doesn't go in nearly enough detail, and why does it have a chapter on DirectInput? In all though, it gives the reader enough information to put advanced features in their games."
5,"Oops, I take back the last comment","I want to give it 4 stars so i put in 5 to offset my last review of 3. I didn't realize that you can change the current project and compile each chapter separately. And each chapter is different. I thought they were just the game in different stages of development but each chapter DOES have different content in the CD's code (and i have no trouble compiling them in VC6). Like chapter 5 shows a simple octogon with lighting on it.The game is quite complex at the end. This guy and his friends are really smart and the book is pretty well written. It's just very hard and can't be learned overnight. If you are impatient you're going to have a tough time with this. But without this book, well, good luck!"
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"Peter has done an amazing job exploring Direct3D. This is without a doubt the best in-depth coverage of the API that I have seen. It is well-written, intersting and easy to read, informative and packed with useful source code. The demonstration game and utilities are icing on the cake. There is virtually no stone left unturned. If you can't write a 3D game using Direct3D IM after reading this book, you are in the wrong line of work. This is a HIGHLY recommended treatment of DirectX/3D and I encourage anyone with even a remote interest to order a copy today!"
3,"Good, but a little dissapointed","I got this book, but all I really wanted was a simple program that will draw like a square and slap on a texture with a simple light or something... but this just keeps building up and building up until the end. It's nice that they break the source code up into chapters, but not everyone needs all the hardware checking, validity checking, enumerations, etc. I am not trying to write a professional game ,just catch the basic basics. I don't have months to try to learn all this in depth and professionally. The source code compiled no problems though. Anyway..."
5,Another great CD from J Mascis,"I can't rave enough about this bands early work. Raw, catchy and some of the best drum work out there."
3,a weaker Dinosaur album,"first let me say that i have listened to this album dozens of times, and everytime i listen i am puzzled by the mix. Where is the bass guitar? and is there even one? I think there is one it's just so quiet that it is practically non-existent. This album lacks the punch and tightness of a 'You're Living All Over Me' or 'Where You Been' and i think it mostly has to do with the dreadfull mix. The Wagon is cool but where is the bass? Maybe it's just me, but i prefer my Dinosaur Jr songs to have more meat and thickness."
2,not quite a classic,"this is not a good example of dinosaur jr.'s magic.... tracks like ""muck"", ""i live for that look"", and ""the wagon"" are simply not standable.... the only tracks i somewhat enjoy are ""water"", ""blowing it"" and thats it. buy their good albums like ""You're living all over me"", ""Bug"" , ""Dinosaur"", but steer clear of this mostrosity..."
4,Views from the Green Mind,"Green Mind was the coming-of-age album for Dinsoaur Jr and it clearly could be the best ever written by J Mascis. Here he blended acoustic rhythms with soaring solos and flowing ballads. J took on much more of a clever and creative sound here, focusing on events happening in and around his life at the time and painted a picture of shear brilliance. Through Dream-Pop, to Folk, slight Jam Band and Modern Psychedelic status, this album is a must-have in the Mascis catalouge.Ben.the 15 year old."
4,Folk For Pogoers,"Rolling Stone once characterized J. Mascis as a folk singer who uses heavy metal guitar, and I think that description is apt. Like folk songs, the ones here are heavy on melody, light on meaning or profundity. The lyrics are maddeningly vauge - ""I'm picking through my thoughts"" is a sample. But WOW, what guitar solos! They belong in the stratosphere with Stevie Ray Vaughn or Albert King. ""Green Mind"" is a good solo song. And hands down, ""The Wagon"" has the most amazing beginning of any rock song EVER. It has no introduction, starts right on note one of the verse. Impossible to describe. This is my fave DJ album."
1,Does not extend,Does not extend screen when u connect to two computer screens. Could not adjust the resolution to a clearer picture.
1,Completely useless,"This product is completely useless. Forget for a moment that it took over 2 weeks to arrive, the cable projects a very low quality picture with background static. I can't believe that it is legal to sell such a useless product...."
3,Could not use,I was looking for a device to use wuth dual monitors on my HP desktop that had one DVI card. I ordered the wrong tyoe as there are so many to choose from. You have to be careful when trying to connect to your existing cables
2,My mixer stopped working too,"I bought this mixer in Jun 2007 and have used it maybe 20 times over the past 2.5 years. Yesterday, I got it out and nothing happened. Like everyone else has said here, I hear the clicking motor sound but nothing happens. It did its job while it worked but this is unacceptable."
1,What a work horse! NOT for long tho!!!!,"WOW! Love it, love it, love it! The best hand mixer I have ever owned in my 60 years.... And it Lasted only 1 year and about 12-14 uses. Not worth fixing according to authorized Kitchen Aid repair shop."
2,"It's my favorite mixer, but it stopped working after a year","This is great! It's much more powerful and versatile than my smaller hand mixer, and for the small stuff much more convenient than the stand mixer. The electronic control makes it easy to use, and it comes with 4 kinds of beaters.Update: I've changed the review to 2 stars -- It seemed like a great deal at the time, but mine stopped working after a year. Probably a problem with the electronic controls."
2,Not what I wanted or expected,"This mixer is lacking in power and the attachments are flimsy. It would not stand up to serious mixing before the metal in the attachments would bend out of shape. I replaced a 35 year old 100 watt mixer with this one, much to my regret. It is a mixer to be used only for light mixing. KithchenAid does not make the power rating in watts available on their literature, therefore it is hard to tell what amount of power you are getting."
2,Short lifespan,"I purchased this mixer in December 2007. At first it was great. For the past few months, however, it has been increasingly difficult to turn on and now the mixing blades seem loose and noisy. I need to use it often and can't run the risk of this mixer finally not turning on, so I will be buying a new one (and not this one!)."
1,Dead out of the box,"I bought this hand mixer in November 2007 but never used it. It has been stored in its original box, in my kitchen cabinet, for the past 3 1/2 years. I just tried to use it over the weekend, and it was completely dead. The On button clicks, but there's no response from the motor. I tried plugging it into three different outlets, just to be sure, because I found it very hard to believe that an appliance could be broken without having been used. I thought KitchenAid was a reputable brand, but this negative experience has changed my mind. In fact, I purchased a different brand of mixer as a replacement for this one."
3,SHORT LIFE,Product worked very well but failed after less than 3 years of very light use. Very disappointing for a Kitchenaid mixer.
3,Okay,"This mixer is just that...a mixer. The blades are great and not at all choppy. However, if you are going to be using it alot go with something better."
1,not very reliable,Bought this mixer in May 2007 when my wife was interested in making cakes at home. We chose this one because we thought KitchenAid was a decent brand and the products might be very reliable. The mixer worked very well when we got it. My wife used it for about less than 10 times and then she lost her interests in making cakes. We put the mixer in box in the cabinet for more than two years and recently took it out and wanted to use it but found the mixer would not work. Maybe we are unlucky but we will think twice if we buy products of KitchenAid again.
4,Kitchenaid 9 speed,"I am glad I bought the 9 speed mixer, because I have found that with the shape of the beaters - you need all nine speed. I love the Kitchenaid brand and it is a nice mixer."
1,Piece of junk,"The mixer itself is very nice. Unfortunately, it comes only with the beaters and a, useless, whisk. The beaters are cheap, made-in-China-s... , and came apart on day two. Fortunately, I had some old beaters which fit and didn't have to send the mixer back. On the other hand, I will never buy this brand again!"
3,Hmm - price confusion,"I'm pretty sure that this was listed at $39.99 but I was charged 49.99. I wouldn't have ordered it, otherwise, because I really wanted the white. I can't check my home email, yet, to see if perhaps that would confirm my suspicion. Did anyone else have this problem?"
4,Dated but Critical Text,"Although this book was written in 1950, the text is still critical. I used the section on direct-contact heat exchangers to design a contact condenser back in 2002. The text is still relevant, the examples current and useful, and some calculation methods still not covered properly in more advanced text. I should point out that although some of the equations are old, they are simplier to use than newer text and require fewer inputs. Besides, when are you going to need calculations accurate to beyond 90%?If this review was helpful, please add your vote -- Thanks."
1,Question of Quality,"I bought this for Christmas for my grilfriend and she loved it. Within 2 weeks, in which she did not wear it that many times, it has a sizeable rip in the back between the soft ribbing. I thought for the price it would at least last a couple of years with simple wear and tear, but it did not even last a couple of weeks. I am disgusted that the qulaity is that bad for something pretty expensive. I am not sure if it is worth sending it back with the price of shipping it back and then again to receive it. Completely shocked and appalled. I wish something could be done! Can anything be done?!"
4,Nice collection,"This is a nice collection of over-looked movies but available much cheaper from BJs, Sams, places like that."
3,....Eh..!,"When Will We See Keeper Of The Flame 1942 & Sea Of Grass 1947 On DVD..?..I Bought This Set For Undercurrent..(Hepburns Only Film Noir, & She Look Very Uncomfortable In The Role..!)..And Without Love..Just Another Wartime Comedy But With A Great Cast..The Rest..?..Eh..!..P/S..I've Seen This Set Online For $19.95..!"
4,the right size,My dogs like skinny sticks only. These are mostly thin sticks so they chew them up anxiously. If they are thick they leave them laying around after glancing at them and turning their heads away.
4,PURCHASED AS A HOBBYIST'S COLLECTIBLE,"Since I don't consider this ModelCar Kit a ""toy"". the rating questions before me I.E. ""How much fun is this toy?"" Don't really apply. I build & collect these, I don't ""Play"" with them( Oh, to be a kid again.....). In all fairness, item was delivered timely and as described. Thank you to both seller & amazon.com"
3,Diaappointing,"These lamps are only worth the $24.95 that they are priced at. No way could these lamps sell for the ""listed"" price of $129.95 at a regular store. They are very mediocre and the details are cheaply molded. Okay for a guest room you do not care much about."
5,Book Review,This book was ordered as a gift. It was received in excellent condition for a used book. Outstanding value from the seller.
4,"Great liner, but not perfect","These socks do exactly what they're supposed to do, help keep your feet warmer and wick away moisture. Just be careful when you don't have another sock over them because they will snap and rip. I had to patch a small hole that I got walking around my house a couple weeks ago."
4,pretty good,"Nice, warm, tough to find long SILK socks which fit tall women so this was a half-baked solution. They'll do for wearing with boots because they cannot be seen."
2,Not a good introduction,"This book seemed to be written more as a reference manual than a user's guide. It has lots of detail (probably more than I really want) on many different kinds of trusts, but it never attempts to put everything together to give you any idea how to start coming up with a comprehensive plan. I realize that I need an adviser to come up with an actual plan, but I was hoping that reading this book would give me some ideas of where to start. Unfortunately, that was not the case. It describes each tree in the forest in (sometimes excruciating) detail, but I still need a map of the forest. Ideally, I would like some examples of paths that people in different situations might take through the forest."
2,Good but expensive,"I used GoToMyPC for about six months, but recently discovered LogMein. It does essentially the same thing, it's just faster, more similar to being at the PC and free. They have a Pro version for file transfers, but I find that I can just email myself a file. I've also looked at mywebexpc, but couldn't get it to work. Definitely try LogMein Free before you pay for GoToMyPC."
2,asdf,"GoToMyPC does have a fairly good service, but for most people it's really not worth the money.GoToMyPC has a strong point in its interface and ease of use. It's a bit complicated to set up and use the first time, but after that it's fairly easy.My main reason for the low review score is the price: I had thought that GoToMyPC was the only choice to do what it does.Once I discovered that that <a href=""http://www.mywebexpc.com/"">MyWebEx PC</a> did the same thing for free I had just spent $99 on I was pretty ticked off... don't let the same thing happen to you. However if money is no object it may be worthwhile for you."
3,an acceptable alternative to silence,"I found this sound card to be an acceptable alternative to silence. It works just fine, its not a high end card and doesnt sound like one, but for the price you shouldnt be expecting top of the line sound. I put this in my kids homework computer and its more than is nessisary. Ive run it with both two and four speakers without trouble.If youre looking for high quality sound look elsewhere, if your looking for a cheap card that works i'd say you found it."
4,Good sound for the price,"I'm not an audiophile so I'm not going to toss around a lot of technical jargon. I bought this because my new 5.1 surround speaker set required six separate inputs, front L&R, surround L&R center & subwoofer. This filled the bill and I am pleased with it's performance. It was easy to install and hook up and the software loaded the drivers without a hitch. If you are looking for premium sound you will likely want to spend more on a higher quality card anyway and probably won't even consider this one. If, however, you are looking for an inexpensive card to make DVDs that you watch on your computer come to life, this one should do everything that you want. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I really have to be blown away by a product to rate that."
1,Ortho Bed Wedge,"Frankly, this product just does not work for me. The flat top is proportionately too long and takes up too much space on the bed; to make it work even half way effectively, pillows are needed to fill in the space and on top of the slanted part of the wedge itself. Finally I ended up buying a whole new bed - one that adjusts; that seemed the best solution to my reflux problem (but an expensive one!). Some instructions with the bed wedge might have been helpful; perhaps I was using it incorrectly."
2,not impressed...,"I've heard Juice freestyle on The Wake Up show and thought he was extremely dope. This album is not. Production and tracks are pretty much garbage, and he just doesn't come off lyrically as I expected. Sorry, Juice, but this album is wack..."
2,They smell horrible!,"They smell like mothballs! I'm still airing them out after wearing them once, and realizing how bad they smell.Would recommend against them, solely based on the smell, even though they look great (the reasoning for the 2 stars vs 1 star)"
4,Great variety of tasty low-fat recipes,"I think this book offers a lot of practical and imaginative low-fat recipes for anyone trying to watch their fat intake. Desserts are a little boring, but for the most part tasty. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Nice watch and retro design...,"I ordered and got this watch quickly - TimeZone is a great seller here on eBay, and you can only get this watch through outside sellers. Fossil stopped making and selling it - as they do with many of their collectible themed watches.The watch itself is rather large. The wrist strap is a big wide affair, and the whole thing looks like something a refined biker might strap to his wrist. The watch hands are clear and prominent. The ""Centipede"" animation is a touch hard to see unless you are in very bright light. By the way it is absolutely not playable, and the score never changes. It's simply a display that is in constant motion. It's fun to watch for a while, and kids will really like it as well as Atari fans. But to most observers it will look like a black faced watch on a black leather band. There is nothing to light the face or animation up."
5,finally a durable combo.,"Bought the PC combo one week ago to replace a 18v dewalt with a burnt out motor, since then, my crew and i have put this through what i consider a torture test. The drill fell two stories onto a concrete driveway and other than a broken drill bit, came through fine. the saw began to loose power after 50 2x4's or so and was recharged in about 45 min. i am very happy with it except the saw has no measurement gauge on the toe.Having had owned a dewalt for many years, this feels better in the hand seems to hold a charge longer, though i havent owned it long enough to be sure."
3,Not the best,"I have used most brands of cordless, with DeWalt being the best. The PC has more volts, but has drastically less run time. I also felt that the handle was less balanced and felt less durable. The tools have good power, but the low run time hurts in the tough applications."
3,porter cable 19.2 v saw,"THE DRILL IS GREAT BUT THE SAW DID NOT MEAT MY NEEDS, ANY LITTLE BIND AND IT STOPS. I WAS CUTTING 1/2 INCH BOARDS AND IF IT GOT INTO A LITTLE BIND IT STOPS. THE DRILL WAS GREAT. THIS SET WAS THE 19.2 VOLT SET."
1,Don't waste your money...,Porter Cable's 19.2 Volt line has major flaws. I bought the driver and saw kit and the hammer drill kit. In the first year I replaced the drill/drivers three times...while under warranty. The saw worked well and the flashlight was the best part of this kit. Now it is a couple years old and the batteries are dead and at $90 each I am not replacing them. I bought Hitachi this time with a five year warranty. I wasted $600 on the Porter Cable junk.
3,Very good,"This is the best book on starting business that I've come across. A lot of practical tips on various strategies (marketing, pricing, promoting etc.). However, it is probably more about running a new business rather than steps in opening one. Worth reading thus.Phuong , MA in Economics student @ U of Toronto."
3,New Business!,"If you are technically savvy and understand a lot ot the business (new business) lingo, you will like this book. I think it is too ""businessy"" and not enough ""beginner business"" information. I'm keeping it as a resource, but I really don't use it as a main book."
1,Unhappy,"I thought I bought a grill guard for a 2008 Ford F-150. After I put it together and tried to get someone to install it, I found out it was for a Chevrolet. Now, I'm going to have to get someone to adapt it to my truck.I don't think I'll buy something like that online again."
4,Heavy stuff,"This book provides an insider's look at how animation is done on computers. It goes into many of the basics, but nevertheless, is not for complete beginners, since it assumes from the beginning that you've got some conception of how animation works and are familiar with some of the vocabulary. However, if you've worked a little with Flash, or have read books like 24 Hours to Flash, you should be able to follow along with this book. Much of the real content of the book is in chapters 2, 3, 4, and 6, where Wagstaff explains the behind-the-scenes details of how professional animation is done, and what makes the difference between a believable animation and a hack-job. Most of the remaining chapters provide brief descriptions of software tools that can be used for various animation tasks. These latter chapters, are of, course, already out of date, but the materials in the preliminary chapters are so well done that the book is well worth the price and will be for years to come."
4,"A Formal Feeling Comes, edited by Annie Finch","A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary WomenThis is a gentle exploration of the work of women poets who write in a formal way or within a formal tradition. As well as featuring excellent poems by virtuoso formalists like Emily Dickinson, and contemporary poets in the new formalist movement like Marilyn Hacker, Annie Finch has done a great job in making available the work of these women poets. Now that so much modern free verse is merely telegraphese, what we find here is the basic notation of poetry, in its glory as sound and sense. Lovers of poetry can find here favourite sonnets by Edna St. Vincent Millay and Eleanor Wylie, and find treasures of poems made available here for the first time in one volume"
4,Good information,"The book took a little longer to come in than expected.... but I did order it through the Christmas season.I have read the book, but have not implemented the diet yet. I will let you know in a month or two."
3,O! blood,"After seeing Christiano interviewed on TV, I was looking forward to reading his book. It's quite detailed, but also pretty rigorous for the average person to follow, who would like to have health improvements. There are long lists of foods that you cannot eat with your blood type, and it tends to be overwhelming. In all honesty, I did not finish reading the entire book---unusual for me, but it was because I became discouraged."
4,Pleased,I enjoyed this book and did learn from it. We immediately started some of the suggestions and have seen changes. I was happy to find a newer blood type/diet book. Joseph Christiano has done some nice work with this book and I appreciate it for the health of my loved ones.-Doctor of Naturopathy student
4,"Bloodtypes, Bodytypes and You",Very interesting book! They made it easy to use since they provide you with a shopping list.
3,"Blood type, body types",Jury is still out on this one. Have been low carbing. This is a little different.
1,Ripoff Artist,"This author steals all of his information form Peter D'Adamo and never gives any credit. In addition, he pushes his conservative Christian agenda down your throat. I was highly disappointed that the author never cited D'Adamo's work. He continually cited himself and previous books. Simply disgusting. It amazes me how someone can get a book published that is entirely a rewording of a highly respected scientist and no one questions this."
2,This book is a disappointment!,This book is boring. I saw the author on Paula White's program and I thought that the book would give me more info on blood type and good eating habits. It did not! Don't waste your money.
2,Unkind to A blood types,"To the staff that wrote this book, one of you said that if ""you have type A blood and expect to live to the life expectancy of 75, you're clearly mistaken"" was just totally wrong. Can I give you some news? I had a great uncle who was type A and lived to be 91 and George Bush Sr and Jimmy Carter are type A and over 80 now. You could be a little more sensitive."
2,"Interesting ideas, shame about the religious crap","Some interesting ideas in this book about food, lifestyle and health. It's a pity about all the religious and creationist crap the author goes on with."
3,Blood Types - Generally good info.,"This is generally good information to use as a guide to diet and otherhealth considerations as they relate to your blood type. I took my ownpersonal survey of friends and family and most people tended to fall into their respective blood profiles. Also, most people had the food sensitivies indicated for each blood type as well. I didn't especially like having to order the products in order to keep on the recommended diet. Overall, I think the diet worked well for my blood type and should be considered."
2,Be carful,"When I ordered this book I bought it as new. When it arrived I found that it had dogeared pages and yellow high liter on a lot of the pages. I have tried to contact Amazon, but they have no phone number. BewareRon S."
1,"Bloodtypes, Bodytypes, and Diethype","I don't usually order diet/lifestyle books. They are a great scheme for someone wanting to publish a book, but the fact is that so many simply cannot prove that the information contained therein is factual and will work for everyone who applies the disciplines described therein. Unfortunately, I fell for the hype on this one -- not from the Amazon website, but from a TV infomercial. My recommendation is ""Don't waste your money. Eat and exercise in moderation. Save your money and buy a really good book from Amazon.com."" In fact, I recommend ""Waking The Dead"" by John Eldridge."
4,"l little hard to do, but worth it.","I bought this book to try to lose some weight. I have followed it pretty much for three months now and have lost 13 pounds. I am blood type O, so I am not supposed to eat wheat, dairy, or citrus. I am supposed to eat some meat too. Since I live in a small community, some of the products are difficult to find such as wheat/gluten free products and nondairy alternatives. I do not eat red meat, but only a little chicken and fish also. I think it does work, but you need to exercise too. I feel very good on this diet and am seeing a big difference in how my clothes fit. Nothing works overnight though!"
1,VHS,"Like I said when it came in and I tried to return it because I didn't catch the fact it was a VHS when I ordered it. I don't have a VHS player. I wanted to return it and get a CD or DVD or a Blu-ray disc. I never got a response in any way. I will not order from that place again. Now that I've said that, don't bother me again about it."
4,"Just About Has It All, Including Skin","Considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films, I have no argument with that, although there are a couple of others I thought just as entertaining. One thing: it's the longest of the series that I've seen at 105 minutes.The overly-drawn-out action finale made the whole thing was a bit too long.Among some, this film is most noted for one thing: skin! ""Jane"" never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the Hays' Code was instituted by the time the next Tarzan film was made. Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan possessed. The nude underwater scene, however, was not her. The woman under the water didn't have a good figure at all, whoever it was.Nonetheless, it is a good mixture of action, suspense and romance. The only things missing are color and stereo sound. The primitive special-effects don't bother me, as that was all that they had back in the 1930s."
3,Does not whistle.,"Kettle works ok. Whistle does not work. This is the second one that we have tried. First burned up when the whistle did not work and we forgot about it. Additionally, the handle becomes too hot for bare hands when the non-whistle steam becomes visible."
5,Revere 3.5-qt. Copper-Bottom Teakettle,This is one of the best teakettles I have ever owned...Classic styling with an affordable price...And did I mention that you can hear the whistle (was that a train?) from the far reaches of my backyard. You won't go wrong with this one.
3,Great Insight,"As an actual ""Master Graphics"" art dealer, dealing Picasso, Miro', Chagall etc. I found the book to be a great insight. Managing artist-dealer realtionships is the hardest aspect of being a great dealer, and is what made Vollard so huge!The previous reader, read this book for the wrong reasons. It's not a handbook, nor intended to be one, on establishing you own business as an artist. You will not find any 'hidden secrets'. If you are an art dealer and want to have an insight as to the mastery of Vollard's ability to manage both the artist and the client, this is your book. If your a 'wannabe' great artist, then this 'capatilistic' point of view will not serve you at all."
3,Anecdotes from a discrete dealer,"This memoir is really a collection of anecdotes, which taken together give a vivid impression of a hardworking networking merchant with very good taste.His energy and determination would have made him a fearsome competitor in what is always a fiercely competitive business. His taste made him memorable.Interesting from a historical perspective, but essentially a lightweight book."
2,BIG DISAPOINTMENT,"I have purchased the NBA LIVE franchise since it's inception. So, I was really looking forward to this year's model with it's improved graphics and with the aid of the Xbox 360. The graphics and presentations are first rate. But it appears the gameplay was intended mainly for the Xbox Live segment. At any level, playing against the computer produces only frustration. Trying to score on the inside is almost impossible while the computer scores at will. There are other gameplay changes that have ruined a game that in the past was the best. Save your money."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"You should really.... NOT buy this game even though I did not buy the game on Amazon, I'm trying to help all of you who are trying to decide hmm should I get NBA 2k7 or Live well it right now is a prety obvious choice NBA 2k7. Live is ment so much for those with live for those without live. Such as u need Xbox live to activate ESPN integration, yeah like anyone ever told me this. So if u are trying to decide wich one get 2k7. Lives graphics are good but 2k7's tops it and the jumpshots for live are'nt that good. And the dynasty mode is not any cooler with the more depth draft and team practices. Live 2003 was good but Live 2007 SUCKS. Also I know I am but don't be fooled by all of the comercials it is nothing like them so stick with 2k7 and u will be happy with your choice for months to come....."
1,Major disappointment,"This game had a ton of hype surrounding it, as EA has dominated in the basketball video game realm for the last decade. Being a staunch follower since Live 95, it was natural to pick up Live 07. Unfortunately, this year's game is HUGE let down. Never have I seen a video game franchise move backwards, but this is apparently the case. The graphics are great as always, but the framerate is unbearably slow and hard to get used to. On top of that, the gameplay itself is weak...the AI exploits the same defensive weaknesses over and over, and because you have little control over what it is your team is doing, this can happen for an entire game. And don't get me started on online play...you might as well be playing over dialup.This game is going up for sale on Amazon's Marketplace later this week, though it's a shame the value of this game is already nearly halved. Looks like 2k7 is the way to go from now on!"
4,I DON't KNOW WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT,"Look, this game is pretty addicting, especially when you play online. Shots are not impossible, and the computer is pretty easy... When you play online it is really fun. I don't know how the guy a couple reviews below me lost by 45 to Hawks,...he must not be very good. THere are a few couple missed dunks, but this only happens when a guy contests the dunk, and the offensive player is not a great dunk.Just press the y button for layups those almost always go in, yes they don't look as good, but they get the job done. This game is really fun, go get it."
2,"The game is a lot of fun, graphics are good, but the overall gameplay is rather poor.","The graphics really look nice and I also like the in depth ""create a player."" The game is a lot of fun and you can do a lot. From the Dynasty standpoint, the game is really realistic and the ESPN integration is really cool. The downfall is during the game, you can blow by anyone and dunk on anyone which is not realistic at all. It's quite fun to play, but not realistic. So, if you are looking for the overall most realistic basketball game out there, I would look elsewhere. If you are looking to just have fun and really enjoy a nice basketball game, then I HIGHLY recommend buying it."
4,great graphics but thats all,"The graphics in this game is great but its wayyy to easy..I'm playing a sesaon in superstar mode and lost only 2 games the whole season, then sweep every team in the playoffs and my wins was like by 30-40 points...06 was at least a little more close to hang with me, this game is totlly way to easy to play"
2,Something missing,"I have been playing NBA Live since it was first released, and I can honestly say that this year has been a huge disappointment for me."
4,Great cd!,"If you like the Violent Femmes, you should own this cd! If you aren't familiar with the Femmes, you should buy this cd and familiarize yourself...its great!"
5,The Best Galapagos Guide Book,"After 6 trips to the Galapagos with University courses, this is by far my favorite guide book. The information in the book is clear, concise, and accurate. The photographs are excellent. Most important, locating the entries for the plants and animals that you encounter on the hikes is quick and easy. My two favorite Ecuadorian guides in the Galapagos Islands both carry only this book."
3,Hmmm...Well...OK...But....,"This ""deluxe"" module actual contains 2 realisticallyindependent parts:Part 1: ""Against the Giants"" recantsword for word (with only minor changes due to...rule changes) the original classic. This alone makes it a item worth buying, IF you do not have the orginal module.Part 2: ""The Liberation of Geoff"" has vague and loose ties to the classic. Basically a bunch of small bland adventures (for a wide range of levels) linked together by the fact that it involves giants and tied together by a map. Whereas having an open ended adventure definitely has it's advantages, it just doesn't fit here as a part of a greater classic. You really can't easily flow from one part to the other with the same group of adventurers.If you have never played the original ""Against the Giants"" module, this is a must. If you have...and more importantly already have the module...there are better things to do with your money."
1,Not as it seemed,"I was under the impression this had a decimal scale on one side, meaning tenths of an inch graduations. It is not graded this way: Instead the ""decimal"" side is still graduated in one-eight inch increments but it gives the decimal reading for one-eight, one-quarter, etc. (I.E: .125, .25...) I did not understand that this is what was meant by ""decimal equivalent"". If you are looking for a one-tenth inch graduated measure this is not it."
3,It's different,Easy to read vertically. Takes getting used to for layout work. Numbers are large enough to read standing up while measuring on the floor.
5,No More Guessing!,"If you're not macho and want to accurate in your measurements, this is the tool for you. I also like that I can measure in both Standard and Metric."
3,Cult film Warning!,"This film is undeniable original. There is nothing like it, not even a little. It's not perfect and there are some things i could do without. The Vomiting for one though there's so much blood, vomiting and swearing that there wouldn't be a film without it. It is however very humorous and well thought out, It quotes from great poets and scientists and the narration acts to show the audience the humanity of these thugs. If you like strange films it's a rare find it's cool this small film found it's way from the basement."
4,A Good Solid Comic Book Adventure.,"Dynamic characters. An insane, sometimes hard to follow but overall satisfying story that to me was a treat to discover. I don't recall ever seeing a film that was so down right silly but played so straight. It's a good experimental film."
5,make your mind wise and your body savage!,"This is most likely the best movie ive seen in 2006! indie b move goodness without apology. good filmwork combined with a brain twisting script(love the over done b movie goodies) Great and occasionaly overdone acting(I think this was intentional)Blows the hollywood dreck away because I start to CARE about the people in this movie, even if they are ruffians!"
3,"ehhhh, it was ok.","My friend make me watch it. It's not really my think but I can see the effort that went into it. The Costumes, the Well, som pretty big brawl scenes. It's a decent rental. I can see these guys going some where in the next decade."
1,Save the $14.99 and make your own movie.,"There are only three ways to enjoy this movie-1) Be forced to watch it at gunpoint.2) Be dropped on your head when you were a child.3) Have parents who are brother and sister.Otherwise, don't bother. This movie isn't worth the plastic it is made of."
3,DVD extras Suck!! oh wait I don't mean suck I mean there are none.,"DVD extras Suck!! oh wait I don't mean suck I mean there are none. The movie is decent, decent action scenes. The DVD needs help, perhaps a menu or some extras would help things. I can't imagine the filmmakers wanted it to be like this so I'm not gong to take it out on them and I'm not that angry because the DVD was cheap but I feel like somone should say something."
5,Killer B movie trash.,A bunch of guys dressed like pirates beating up people in bars is great by my standards. Troma should have released this film though they would have at least put a menu on the DVD. It's suprisingly literate with Hemmingway-esc narration you know but with fart jokes. There is no film like this on the market and no doubt it's not for everyone. This is like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste and I can't help but think if someone ever gave these guys a budget then maybe we'd get another Dead Alive.
1,Don't believe the lies.,"I actually worked on this movie. Well, briefly. I worked as a grip for the classroom scenes. But only for a few days because I simply could not stomach the out-of-control egos of the Hale Manor Collective. I also have to point out something very shady going on here. A few days ago, someone posted an honest review of this movie that the Collective did not agree with. A quick side note, the reviewer hit the nail on the head in saying that the reviews came from the people involved with the movie. When the DVD's listing first appeared here on Amazon, an e-mail was sent out for everyone to post reviews. When the negative review was posted, another e-mail was sent out telling us to ""bury it"". The good reviews that are on this page are not honest, they are all phony and posted by the various members of the Hale Manor Collective. And frankly, that really stinks and is really unprofessional. So guys, face the facts. You made a lousy movie and somebody called you on it. Grow up."
2,"Stop the pain, I want to get off!","I got this movie for my birthday. Let me tell you, having a birthday so close to x-mas really bites. But not as much as this movie does. When it started, it was so bad that I thought it was a comedy. It's not. Points for trying, but it makes grateful that Amazon has a great return policy. And, Mike, if you're reading this, for your birthday I'm going to get you ten pounds of rotting fish. That should let you know just bad this movie stunk."
3,Definitly a rental,I'm cutting this one a break because I just watched like three really horrible flicks in a row but this one was at least made with craft. I'm only writing to basically replace the other review I had up. It wasn't really fair and when I rewatched the film I found that it was a decent work. Keep at it guys.
1,"Better than bad, it's WORSE!","A friend of mine saw this movie at a film festival in Connecticut (which was actually two guys and a video projector at a local library community room). He said that this was the worst movie he had ever seen. I happened across ""Land of the College Prophets"" while looking for a christmas gift and asked my friend if this was the movie he saw. It was and I ordered it. Man, was my friend right! This movie is bad. This movie is beyond bad. The people involved with making it, with showing it, and with putting it on dvd should be banished to Syberia and should never have contact with other people ever again. You want a good movie with a great plot and great visuals? Go see (or rent) ""Hostel"". You want to waste both your time and your money and feel angry that you did? Then pick up ""Land of the College Prophets"""
3,It's about as good as Undead.,Both Undead and College Prophets were made on shoestrings. Both are pretty cool smaller films that came out this year. It's worth flixing.
4,Very fun,This is my first time working with paint by number but I didn't want something easy. It's a great project on which for me to focus. The paint brush and the paints are pretty good too. Good overall.
2,gift for my daught,she is good at drawing this makes me very happy cute scene very easy to follw quite relaxing difinely up north
2,great product..horrible shipping,"Great product. Have ordered sets before and they always come in their presentation box, that includes the color picture of what the finished product is supposed to look like. The kits are always nice. This time though, the box was removed to save space in shipping, and the paints, canvas and instructions were placed in a smaller shipping box. This was a gift, so when the gift arrived, the birthday girl had no idea what the finished product was to look like, as the reference to the finished product was on the box that was removed. No color picture for reference. Not a good idea on a paint by numbers kit. Like I said, horrible shipping, nice product. Will not order again."
1,Recent purchase,"Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts on the purchase of the Dimensions oil painting. Although it looks very beautiful in the picture, I have not received it yet. I ordered this painting on Dec. 20th and there was an error in my physical address (which the system would not allow me to correct). I have contacted the company via email and they state they have not received the undelivered product yet!(01/21/11). Once the item comes in they can then cancel my order and I will have the chance to re-order if I desire. Their company procedure is not very customer friendly. I would prefer if they update the address and re-send the painting automatically. They have my payment in full and the correct address to send it to. Having to start this long process all over again has tainted my desire to purchase anything from them again."
5,great painting!,"I love Dimensions PaintWorks paintings. The colors in this one are actually more vivid and vibrant than the others I've done by Dimensions. They numbers are clearly printed on the board and the insert with the complete picture and numbers is very nice to have. I love these paintings and they are the only ones I will buy. The only downside is that they only send one brush in each kit, it would be nice to have more. Great product!"
5,Thank you Dimensions,"The 'cardinals in winter' was a joy to do, I framed it and it is now on my dining room wall. People can not beleive that it is a PBN. I will be buying Dimensions Paintworks again. I am updating this review as I recently purchased the 'leopard in repose' I am two thirds of the way through it, and it is amazing!!! Dimensions PBN are wonderful, I can't praise them enough!"
3,Paint by Number Kit Cardinal,"This is a fine adult paint by number kit considering what is available. HOWEVER, it definetly has room for improvement. My biggest dislikes were: a) a too much mixing of color and b) when you did mix they dried up so quickly, I mean in about 5 minutes, and c) the quality of the acrylic paint is very poor. It usually doesn't cover the number and lines and the light colors (which are numerous in this particular painting) require too coats. Perhaps if this were not the case I wouldn't have minded mixing the colors so much.I lament the loss of oil paint by numbers. They cannot be found now. The colors were deep and rich, they did not need second coats and if you had to mix the colors didn't dry up so fast. The old paint by numbers are very collectable right now and that is largely because of the quality of the paint. Well the designs are very cool too."
4,pretty good,i loved the way this painting came out. the colors were great. everyone loves it. occasional black spots but easy to fill in
5,A Great Help!,"What a great help this is! You Can Write A Cookbook is a resource for writers that can be utilized by many organizations. So often women's clubs and charities publish cookbooks with little to attract buyers. Using the suggestions in Wolfe's book can mean a real ""Book"" rather than just a collection of recipes. It offers the opportunity to present an appealing offering, likely to be in demand."
4,GETTING READY,"My friend and I are in the middle of producing/writing a shrimp cookbook, and we found this little book to be a great help. It gave us some good ideas on different directions to go, and also some ideas about getting our book out to the right people for publicity. I would have appreciated a glossary of terms for cooking, although the media terms and connections were well presented. We had always heard that every cookbook had been written but Kevin made us realize that the market, and the audience, are out there waiting for our culinary masterpieces. If nothing else, we are having fun cooking up the recipes, taking photos, and of course, the best part, we are making some tasty, healthy meals. Some one has to eat them! Happy cooking..."
2,two time looser,"1st drill lasted 4 months-gears frose up,took it back to where i bought it,2nd drill lasted 2 yrs (motor frose up)it worked well when i needed it, great tool! however for the money i would expect it to last much longer with only moderate household use,won't do it again!"
1,Junk,"I sold all of my tools and decided to replace them with Porter Cable Products. After buying a router and returning it once, I purchased this drill/driver. I used the drill for one day and the transmission froze up. I returned the drill and received another Porter Cable 14.4 drill. The chuck was so off center that I could not even drive in a screw. I had sold everything to go with a company that had a good name, and I have been sad with the results. I returned the drill and purchased a Dewalt 14.4 which has performed wonderfully."
3,be careful of the edition,"Be careful of the edition: there are Marketplace sellers selling this book as ""brand new""... but their edition is not as pictured, and is 15 years old!! Ask your seller. I give the book 5 stars."
4,Can't get enough!,"My girls received this set of books for Christmas and they are devouring them! They are literally waiting in line and breathing down their sister's neck waiting for their turn.Enjoying the RideThe books address ""real"" issues in an entertaining, yet true to life way...good stuff."
5,exit sign bulbs,timely shipping and great valuue for the dollor. just hope the fire dept does not come back to check how long the bulbs last.
2,Not durable enough for a 3 year old,"I love the looks and the sound of these mallets against our Remo floor tom-tom. However, it took only a couple of days for my 3-year old to dislodge the end from one of the mallets while playing. After laboriously removing the fabric to re-glue the foam head to the stick and refastening the fabric, the same thing happened.Now.... I am sure there are going to be people reading this who will think (or comment) that we should be standing behind our son at all times guiding him to play gently and respect his drum and mallet, and if you are one of those people, feel free to ignore my review. If you have a child who is enthusiastic about music and sometimes gets a little carried away, you might want to find an alternative to this product."
2,mallet was a little bit weeny,"it was a little short in my hand, but works...just personally prefer a more substantial mallet. came with the drum, so it's ok, good enough, but i may try to find or make another.LOVE the drum, mallet just ok.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00066U2S8/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img"
3,They're ok,"Not really worth the chunk of change I spent on them. My kids loved decorating pretzels with the melted chocolate and designing their own treat with sprinkles. BUT, they ended up eating cookies instead because this stuff just didnt taste that great. Fun project with the kids, but they wouldn't even eat them. :("
1,Expensive and didn't melt,"I've heard the Mercken's brand of melts works great for things like cake pops. My order did not come close to meeting these expectations. I think the package I received was old because after just 30 seconds in the microwave, the melts were crumbling and never melted. These are also very expensive for the amount you get. I would beware ordering these from Amazon - maybe the ones you buy in stores are ok, but I don't have a store nearby they are sold in."
5,Good Solid Sliding Table,"The sliding table assembly took about 1 1/2 hours. It is heavy so lifting it into place while doing the initial assembly is best done with a helper.The table was relatively easy to align to square.The sliding action is smooth.The miter fence attachment seems well thought out and durable(it must be noted that I do not use it for crosscutting very large panels (>36"" long) - use a panel saw).In general a good accessory for a good saw."
2,Portraits of unlikable women,"Inspired to buy the book after reading the US News and World Report mini-bios of the class of '69, I should have left it at that. A more in-depth examination revealed women who are tedious anachronisms, agonizing over their choices with all the self-indulgence and navel-gazing that we have come to expect from front-end baby boomers. Many of us went to fine Ivy League schools and came to realize that ""the best and the brightest"" mantras of these institutions were a bit of a fib. Not these Wellesley girls. They bought it and apparently travel through life jam-packed with an unusual sense of entitlement and a curious feeling of intellectural superiority. What else could we expect from such ""gifted"" women. Is there anyone in the Class of '69 who navigated through their world humbly, maturely and peacefully? Ironically, most of them came across as spoiled, shallow and dim-witted."
1,UTTER GARBAGE--DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"I am writing this review after having owned this DVD for 2 years.I've watched it from start to finish just twice; to make sure I didn't miss anything--I didn't.The only section that was passable was Daniel Negreanu's.I cannot understand how people like Tannenbaum can get away with just babbling vague aphorisms (he does this in his other conference appearance too--seriously, who hired this guy, can he really play poker??). If you care to comment, I'll dig the DVD out again and give you straight quotes of nonsense from this DVD to convince you.This DVD was near the bottom of my list of what are mostly pretty average DVDs out there, and I have viewed or bought practically everything out there.Almost anything by Sklansky is vastly better. Let the discussion begin before I use this for a coffee coaster.AVOID AT ALL COSTS! FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS."
3,OWNER CREATIVE WOODWORK,I have recived some negative feed back on my original commits about the DW746.I have since bought one through TOOL CRIB and it seems to a good saw I have had a hard time geting the fence to allow me to rip very strait even with some adjustment.I have also had problems getting the saw to be stable due to the square leg design and the PLASTIC feet.I do like the dust collecting port(much better than my old Delta)I do own about 15 other Dewalt tools and I am VERY happy with them!
4,Excellent reference book for planning a quinceañera.,"I'm currently planning my daughter's quinceañera and this book was a God-sent. It provides in-depth information on this special celebration, covering multiple latin cultures. I was not able to find another book in the market that begins to cover the quinceañera like this book does. I recommend it to anyone interested in planning a successful quinceañera."
5,Essential,"This book was abousoulty the best information that I have found on quinceanera's out there. It takes you step by step giving great examples of menu's and ceremonies.I am starting my own event planning business and this book has given me knowledge that I did not know previously.I would recommend this book to anyone that is planning a quinceanera, it will save you a lot of stress and anxiety."
4,What I brought in Disney store today !,I alway loved Thumper as a little girl in the 1942 classic of Bambi because thumper had a sense humor with Bambi !I never owned any memorabilia of Bambi as a child in the early 1980's !I brought Thumper in memory of my movie experince with Bambi and my mothertaking me see the Walt Disney carttoon in the early 1980's !
5,Been using this product for about a decade,I'm on unit number 2 after about 10 years and the original unit is still in commission after sharpening the cutting blades and digging up a couple extra batteries. While I prefer Milwaukee for my tools they have not released a cordless version of this tool and until they do my whole company uses these (I run a heating and cooling company and the cordless versatility is worth the added cost)
2,TINY,The title says LARGE but it is VERY TINY.We were shocked when we pulled it out of the mailbox.Maybe your shouldn't put large in the description if it isn't.It broke the first day as well.I don't reccomend it.
5,Excellent Product,Our grandson really likes this toy. It is very sturdy and has excellent detail. I would recommend this toy to anyone.
3,Dissappointed,"I bought this for my son, who is obsessed with buses/trains/etc. It's a nice size overall, but ""working"" pieces (ie, the side and front door, stop sign) have already broken off. The outer shell is of good quality but sign and doors are cheap plastic and broke off the first time they were played with. These broken pieces are also very small and become instant choking hazards. My son doesn't care about the missing pieces, he still enjoys playing with it."
3,Broken after first day,"The first day, one of the doors came off. The next day, the stop sign broke off. At this point (we bought it a little over a month ago), the wheels have stopped turning, the grill is broken, the doors don't work, part of the bumper has broken off, and the entire bottom is loose. Basically, all of the plastic pieces are broken. That being said, my 2 year old son loooooves his bus and carries it around everywhere. And he's pretty careful with his toys. It just doesn't seem to be made to play with!"
4,Yellow Bus,My two year old grandson loved the yellow bus. When he drives in his mom and dad's car he passes a gas station where the local school buses fill up and he says yellow bus. We learned that if you push it backwards it goes forward. It was great fun and a solid toy.
3,Broke on first day!,"My son loves this bus, but the wheels were off kilter and stopped turning by the end of the first day. I expected the little pieces (doors, stop sign) to break easily yet they are intact. Never did I imagine that the power to ""go"" would go first. So disappointing!"
5,Love it,I bought this for niece and she love this toy. It is stilll in good shape so material is pretty steady.
1,Broke within minutes,"I bought this product for my 2 year old's birthday. He loves school buses and I thought this would be a good size toy for him and because it is die cast, I thought it would be durable. Within minutes of him opening it, the doors were collapsing in and one of the detail strips on the side came off. I can honestly say, he was not playing rough with it at the time. And as another reviewer stated, the wheels lock with slightest pressure on top. I am truly disappointed with this product and would not recommend this to anyone. Try to find a better one!"
2,Should have read the specs more closely,Good quality but too small for kids below 4 years. Kid would have enjoyed if its a little bigger. Pay close attention to the product dimensions.
4,bus to play,My foster kids love this bus! The only problem is the doors that open are not very durable and have broken...
1,Terrible Toy,"The Schylling Large School Bus was one of my 3-year-old's Christmas gifts, and quickly became a favorite. However, it just as quickly fell apart, leaving very small (and often sharp) pieces all over the floor for my one-year-old to choke on. The stop sign on the bus didn't last an hour, and for days my toddler was coming to me with various bits and pieces to put back together. Most of the pieces simply couldn't be reattached, and once I found our youngest choking on a wheel I threw the whole thing in the garbage. This toy is not safe for a household with *any* children under 4."
4,Looks Real,"It's a tiny little school bus that is very well made when you just look.It has everything that is in the real school bus(steering wheel, seats, emergency exit door on the back, etc.) but the tiny little parts could break easily.My 21 month old son broke the steering wheel and a door on the first day he got it.(Made in China)And this is a little smaller than its measurement. as small as a woman's hand.But my son loves it."
3,Be careful of some small pieces,"My two year-old loves buses. I know the product isn't recommended for kids that young due to small pieces, but he had those broken off within the first five minutes. The stop sign will snap off with very little force. The doors for the bus are very hard to open and normally come off once you do get them to open. I don't think there are any more small parts left now to come off now."
4,Durable Toy,"Well made and sturdy toy for your toddler or older child. They won't be able to fit much in it as it has small doors, but it is bigger than many you see at the store. Worth the money."
3,Toddler loves it - but it broke within the first hour!,My son is obsessed with busses so I bought this for him and he LOVED it immediately. Only problem - is that it broke within an hour! The stop sign was broken off (by him I'm sure) and then the doors came out. Next the back wheels got pushed up into the body of the bus so it can't be pulled back and let go. My husband has had to fix the wheels countless times already. Wish there was a more durable option but he literally asks for this 1st thing when he wakes up each morning!
4,school bus,My grandson loves this school bus however the first day he played with it the door broke off but otherwise the bus is sturdy. He still likes to play with it.
3,My son loves the bus but parts broke with in 1 minute,This bus is pretty cool but not made well enough to be toddler proof! He broke the stop sign within 1 minute and the front door.
4,"Overall, very durable",I got this school bus for my grandson for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. The moving parts (stop sign and doors) are made of plastic and I knew when I got it that they wouldn't last long. The stop sign is already broken off. Not much disappointment since I knew it would happen anyway. This bus is a good size and otherwise very sturdy.
5,Kids love it.,"This toy bus is very realistic. It has operable doors and even a stop sign that opens up on the side. My son and nephew are two years old, and they both love playing with it. In fact, we ordered a second bus so they could each have their own."
1,Where's the promised source code?,"I bought this book about two months ago and tried to compile one of the programs, but I received an error. I couldn't compile because I didn't have access to a resource file that should have been provided on the publishers(SAMS) web site. I contacted the publisher and they informed me that the code would be available as soon as the author provided it to them. It's been two months. Where's the code"
2,Not teach you MFC in 24 hours,"You will not learn MFC from this book in 24 hours, even in 24 days. I thought this book will be easy for you to read to grap basic skill about MFC. After I strugled more than 24 hours with this book, I realize that this book just explain some Wizard-generated code, neither teach you the structure of FMC nor write your own code using MFC.I can understand other VC MFC books before reading this book, this book suppose be easier to read, but still confuses me.So, I give 2 stars because it's not very expansive, but wastes my time."
2,Explains Very Little,"It gives an example app called skeleton, and explains very little of how it actually works.Very disappointing."
1,This book is garbage,"I am a professional software developer in a small think tank in California. I have extensive experience with OOP C++. I read the book with the thought that other reviewers may not have had the experience that I did, and therefore were unable to learn MFC from this book. Even with my experience, though, I could not learn how to use MFC from this book. It is worthless. Additionally, it states that the source code for the text can be found from the book's companion website, but does not give the address of the website. So one can not even learn from the code. If 0 stars were available, I would have given this book 0 stars."
1,for reading only...,I bought this book last September 1999. This book covers almost all area of MFC programming and is really good for just giving you the very basic idea. Once you start doing programs this is highly not recommended and will just waste your time.
5,Welsh Terrier,"I found the book very good. I learnt more about my Welsh Terrier than the bit on the internet. This book gave info about what we were doing wrong and what we did right. In choosing a welsh terrier we did every thing right. I still believe that a new pet is a family afair. We have always had Airdale Terrier but wanted a smaller dog, so we chose the Welsh Terrier. what a lovly dog."
4,Terriers,We have a 2 yr old terrier and this provides a lot of good information. A lot was about puppies but we learned about the other life stages as well.
4,Very small with nice soft light - great for travel.,"Got a couple of these with a package of used stuff and was quite impressed. Light is much softer than with a bare bulb and makes a very noticeable difference.The hot shoe connectors are a great design and enable one or two to be held in each hot shoe mount. I've had some problem with getting a good pc cord connection, but pc cords do tend to go so I'm not sure if it's the connector or the cord.Will be perfect for trips to the inlaws with some small light stands. With a 550ex in manual mode on my 1Ds, and the built in slaves, I can meter with FEL through the camera too, so no need to bring a light meter. Just need to adjust the flash to subject distance to change the amount of light."
1,Same as the old sunpak flat panel,"This is the same as the old sunpak flat panel.. with the same problems. 1: Very good at less than 8ft. after that the fall off is extreme.2: cumbersome to handle.. better to be put on a stand than to camera mount.3: To actually be worthwhile you need to slave at least 2 of them. better off buying a box light set for the about the same amount and have more flexability and options. (these are meant to work like a ringlight..poor alternative)On the plus side these are definitely portable. you can carry two of these in a briefcase.(if you can find the old sunpak fp's ) get those and save the cash. With care, these things are really built to last forever."
3,Bloated Book,"The author enjoys repeating himself, making for a thicker and more bloated book than necessary. Unfortunately, this detracts from the casual reading experience.However, the book is nonetheless insightful and worth a scan at a bookstore."
1,I found the book offensive,"One of the suggestions was to 'sell' yourself, which sounds sensible but just not the way it was presented. Interview people at random, out of the phone book and ask ""who do you know that personally that know a lot of people?"" But I read further, and the more I read, the more I found their propaganda crap more offensive. He suggests give it to a friend when you're done reading it, I wouldn't give it to someone I didn't like let alone a friend."
3,A little too quick for me,"My job search wasn't enhanced by this book. I felt that it didn't focus enough on choosing the right career and the right job like Vaultreports.com. Thus, it didn't help me a great deal in choosing what to pursue."
2,"""Narnia Lite""","This background is reminiscent of C.S. Lewis' Narnia. A young child enters a different world through a magic door and meets good and evil characters. The comparison ends here. There is none of Narnia's rich texture, excitement and underlying morality. The book is poorly written, the plot could have been written by a (not very talented) 11 year old and leaves one feeling cheated. The beautiful illustrations make up the only redeeming feature."
1,Blade for Cuisinart Blender CBT-BG,Very bad product. Broke after second usage while preparing a smoothy. The central axle snapped at the level of the screw. It seems to be made of a different material: color yellow. Have images available.
4,Replacement,"Our Cuisinart blade broke after a 4 to 5 years, so we had to replace it. This fit our blender perfect and has worked fine. I was just disappointed that this piece broke in the first place. Every part of the blender feels solid and sturdy, but this appears to be the weak part of the blender."
5,Saved my investment,Great to be able to buy replacement parts to save costs on buying a new blender. Fits well.
5,"Why buy new, when you can fix the old.","We really use our blender several times daily. When the blade's plastic base fell apart, we were fortunate to find the perfect replacement at a fraction of the cost of a new blender."
3,"Good replacement, bad design..","Do yourself a favor and have an extra one of these (with the gasket) handy, because one ice cube too many and these things self destruct. On my last one the plastic bottom piece that connects to the drive piece on the motor stripped itself and spun freely. Boo to Cuisinart for putting such a shoddy part on what otherwise would be a great blender."
2,"Needs to be disassembled, cleaned & lubricated.","I had often noticed the blade wouldn't spin by hand, so I'd lubricated it with food-grade silicon. Then one day as I was mixing pudding, smoke started rolling out of the blender. It was this blade. It had gotten so hot that it melted the plastic and when it cooled, the shaft was forever stuck. There was actually melted plastic around the rubber clutch. In the future, instead of just oiling it, I'll disassemble the unit (being careful to not slice my fingers on the blade) clean the hole and shaft, then lubricate and assemble. I've had much cheaper blenders over the last 40 years and never had to do this with any other."
2,Like It & Hate It,"This seems to be a nice blender, except the blade assembly SUCKS!!! That part is cheap!Many bad reviews on this blade assembly.My cutting blade shaft was seized up when I pulled it out, but it worked fine the last time I used it. It must have heated up and siezed last time. It is shotty quality and seems they made it consumable to make more money.I tried to disassemble the blade assembly, with leather gloves, pliers and a socket wrench, the shaft just sheered off at the nut. $20 every time it goes bad is pricey."
3,Not even worth the made in mexico price,"Not sure why PC decided to export their manufacturing, but their latest line of power tools is far lower quality than it was 5 years ago. Their power/speed ratings are overestimated, and reliability has been poor. I've returned two of these, and finally got a Milwaukee. Now, that Milwaukee is astonishingly good. Made in Germany, it is precise, and powerful. Try watching your drill or driver bit in the chuck as you pull the trigger. On both of the PCs I returned, there was clearly some wobble (did not spin cleanly on its axis). I bought DeWalt that did the same thing, and the gear changing on the DeWalt was atrocious (3 gear model).The Milwaukee was close to perfect."
1,Battery mount worn out after three weeks?! Come on.,"I was pretty pleased with this drill for the first three weeks, (I use a cordless every day), but now my battery mount is worn out. I need to push the battery up just a hair to get it to make contact. Infuriating, to say the least. I knew this was a new-ish design, but thought I could trust PC, having used and abused their routers for years. I am real disappointed and would recommend any buyers to stick with a company with a good cordless drill history, Makita or Bosch. My buddy swears by his 12v Panasonic, but it is pricey."
2,Most disappointing PC power tool I owned.,"The power is good, the grip a bit on the large side. Unfortunately, I had to return my drill/driver the first time because the forward/reverse lever fell out. I returned it a second and final time because the electric brake stopped working. I swithced brands."
3,try something else,"I've had this cordless for a few years, and it has some major weaknesses. First, the hammer action is far weaker than expected, even for a cordless. P-C (last I heard) was using the same hammer motor for all 3 sizes(voltage ratings).Also, I have gone through several batteries. Even bought new,they have fried quickly.I have since heard from other contractor types complaints about P-C batteries- weak, go bad or dead quickly....Thirdly, even though I use my gun mostly for driving short screws to hang pipes, I'm a plumbing contractor, my high range only slips now, and the low range is starting to go too.It's not the deal I thought it was for sure.On the pos. side, it has a good feel, balance and torque that I'll be looking for in my next cordless."
4,Excellent for this price,"We have been using this at our church. The runner has held together over 5 sundays of traffic. It's light, but for our purposes has been working great. Using this outside would speed up it's deterioration, but for a one night event it would work just fine. This product should not be confused with a real red carpet, it will only give you the atmosphere you are looking for, not the real thing. It is a toy after all."
4,"Worked for a night, but it is just thin plastic","The item is thin plastic, but at the price we know we are not buying a high quality carpet. It was link a table cloth material, worked for a dvd premier at the church."
2,pricey accessory with awkward installation,"This is a pricey accessory for the DeWalt DW746 table saw that can be omitted. I was disappointed in the cumbersome and awkward installation. This outfeed table needs to be redesigned with a more quick and easy attachment method. DeWalt should consider offering a wider version of the outfeed table that matches the full width of the tabletop with extension wings. Although disappointed with this product, I ended up keeping it and cannibalizing the hardware to build my own custom outfeed table."
1,Table has no hinges,Any basic table saw that has an outfeed table should have hinges to fold down for storage. This table has none. Spend you money on building your own.
2,poor top covering,"While the fit with the rest of the saw (I have all the other options as well) is good, for the life of me, I can't figure out what DeWalt was thinking when they put the top covering on this table extension. The basic idea of an outfeed table is to support longer materials so they slide through the blade more easily and with less binding. The very first piece of rough wood I ran through the saw tore through the flimsy covering, rendering it useless. I wound up covering the top with high density plastic to get a nonbinding surface. Now the rest of the covering is detaching from the table, so I will have to replace the surface again. My recommendation: if you buy this, plan on immediately resolving the issue with the top or you will regret it later."
4,Very convienent.,"Quality.Easy to set up and disconnect.Subtracted a star only because of the price.If you have the room,make your own.If you don't have much room,it's convienent,durable and folds away."
1,4 years of use,I have owned a Dewalt table saw with this extension for 4 years. The fibre board surface curved and sagged even with the steel stiffener underneath resulting in the workpiece only being supported partially. The leg is flimsy and can move in and out making the top surface move up and down. Not a design for the long run.
1,"Didn't Pull, Didn't Test Properly for Me","- Does not pull the mini fuses on a Lexus. Check to see if your fuse holder box has side tabs next to the mini fuses. They block this puller from being able to grab the fuse.- Gave me a false read. Tested a fuse, light turned green meaning fuse is good. Spent days to finally find out that the fuse was actually broken when I decided to do a visual on the fuse."
2,Potential tape transfer noise issue with GS400,"Superb cam, picture quality is excellent - so is handling.According to several reports in internet unfortunately large quantity seems to be affected with tape transfer noise, the one I bought too. For more info see www.akuutti.netKind Regards,PKa"
5,An excellent movie,"As someone who grew up in Kenya in the 50s and 60s, I can attest to the fact that this film captures the feel and the spirit of colonial Kenya better than any other film ever made. The characterizations are excellent, and the story is both entirely believable and captures the nature of colonialism without being judgemental. The little boy in the lead role does an excellent job - you can fully empathize with him - and the late Bob Peck is, as ever, superb in the role of the local head of the police. More explanation was needed of the attitude of his wife, it was difficult to really grasp the thinking of the Mau Mau guerillas, and the ending was perhaps a little predictable. Overall though, this was a terrific film, and instantly gets slotted into my Top Ten of all time."
4,Great Texas Hold'em starts Here,"It was hard for me to give this book 5 stars, because that would make it the equivalent of the Great Gatsby, but this is the best book on Texas Hold'em I have ever read. I started by reading it three times in a row and then went to Biloxi and played a 17 hour marathon. I took my share of bad beats, but with the rake and all was only down $100 all due to Mr. Jones. The best thing he defines is how to figure what kind of game you are in and how to play in that kind of game."
5,Solid Poker Book,"I've been playing poker for years, and I believe this book thoroughly addresses the fundamentals of low limit holdem. Many people left bad reviews for this book, but that's because they don't truly understand the concepts of risk, fundamentals of betting, nor calculations of odds. With that said, however, I will agree that some books do cover some concepts of poker in a deeper fashion. Either way, this book is a great read for anybody who does not completely understand the concept of odds."
4,Very Good But Understand the Facts with Low Limit,"One of the best books out there on low limit hold 'em, but you need to face reality. If you're in a casino where they're raking 10% and dumping another $1 per hand into a jackpot, just enjoy the free drinks and discounted or free food. Unless you're sitting at a hyper-loose table or surrounded by several idiots or drunks, you're not gonna make any money over the long haul. I've been stuck at many a table where everyone played essentially the same way: tight and solid. The winners (and there might not be any if you stay long enough) will be the person or persons who just happens to be getting the cards that night. Try bluffing at one of those tables! Occasionally you'll steal a pittance of chips, but more often than not you'll be badly beaten on the river w/ your Jack high being slightly nudged out by a full house."
3,very informative,This is a very good book for beginning and intermediate players. Has good simple theories and explanations. Limit hold'em is a much harder game to win steadily than it seems when you first start playing.
1,losing at low limit holdem,"following the guidelines in this book ie pocket cards,position play before and after the flop etc and playing exactly as Lee Jones spells out I have lost over $$$ steadily over a 4 month period.The book appears well written with seemingly good ideas but my experience over this period tells me that the contents are seriously flawed.Over this period I have played about 20 hours per week which I think gives the book a fair hearing"
4,Instant Poker Success,"Everyone is into the Texas Hold-em craze. Yet, as a novice to play the game, you can't rely upon watching ESPN or Fox Sports to truly understand how to play. That's why books like this are written. ""Winning Low-Limit"" gives the beginning player a perspective and strategy for each aspect of playing in a Texas Hold-em game. Things that you never see on TV, such as how to play in various positions, and what hands to throw away, and when to those those hands away are among the many topics covered in detail in this book. I was able to use this strategy after one read, and win our in-house tournament. I would recommend that you read this book several times, and play several games to really let the concepts sync in. There is a lot of information in here, and to be a great player, you have to learn it all."
1,You can skip this one.,"Great for the beginner I am sure. If you have been around, played, or talked about the game...or have a general idea of the game...you can skip this one. There is much better material out there to be obtained and absorbed. After reading this...you can sit at a small stakes game and not lose quickly...but you will not win...and if you do...it won't be very much. Concepts are simple and basically will make a ""weak"" player out of you. Nothing more, nothing less. Of all the poker books I have obtained, this by far is the only real disappointment."
4,Very good,"This was my first and still favorite instructional poker book. A very easy read, I read it twice on the flight to Vegas prior to playing poker for the first time in a casino. I've revisited chapters of it since, and I believe it still applies nicely to structured limit games today."
3,Read Fast before it self-destructs,"I an finding this book to contain excellent advice on winning at holdem. However the book is falling apart as I read it. The binding is so poor that the pages fall out almost as you finish the page. I think this kind of book would be used as a continuing referance which make this problamatic.I think all of the information is here though it does take some digging out at times. Also it could have been better, if the examples presented were better organized and clearer."
5,Valuable Lessons,"This book explains how to play low-limit hold 'em and provides numerous strategies for winning.While I am a beginner and am having a hard time keeping track of all the nuances, I have learned some valuable lessons about position, which pocket cards to bet with, and post-flop play.This is mostly for fun. I am practicing these strategies with poker software and play money. I also recommend Poker Academy V2 by Pokersoft.I haven't bet online or played at a casino. I might if I get really good."
1,Not for internet poker,"I can only speak for holdem on the internet and this book does not work. You will play very few hands following the advice given which of course is correct. However with the flop only hitting approximately 1 in 3 you will now call very few bets postflop. To make matters worse too many players stay to the river with poor draws in low limit. You will beat some of these players but not all of them. I have kept records for 100 hours play on the internet which is played very fast....6100 hands, won 219 hands including some lucky big blinds.With such a small percentage of wins the blinds just eat your bank away.Following the advice exactly as written I have lost $500 over the 100 hours. The advice may work in card rooms and casinos but I do assure you it does not work at low limit holdem on the internet"
5,A must read,"Anybody that is planning on, or allready does play Hold'em at limits less than 10/20 must buy this book. It is about the cheapest poker book around (with a few exceptions) and at least in my case, pays for itself immediately, many times over. As a regular 3/6 player, I went from a long string of consistent small (and sometimes big) losses, with an occassional big win, to a consistent winner. Of course, while this book is a good Hold'em primer, you must also read the more advanced Sklansky/Malmuth material, to become more familiar with the intricacies of the game, and so that you can someday move up to the more favorable, medium limit games. Buy it!"
5,This is a must read for any beginner,"I read this book about a year ago when I started playing poker online, and I'm happy to say that it gave me the foundation for being a constant winning player. I've made close to $10,000 playing online by following the basic strategies in this book. The players in the 1-2 games online are absolutely pathetic, so by following the advice in here and just playing a tight game, you'll win much more often than not. If you want to make some nice supplemental income, just read the book and follow the rules. Easier said than done, but get some practice and the money is there for the taking."
5,More value than just a Low Limit book,"Beyond the title referenced Low Lmit Hold-Em games the concepts in this book can also be adapted to establish an introductory method towards playing loose smallball poker in No Limit poker games.The discussed concepts of ""implicit collusion"" as well as the dicussion on how to play agressively against multiple opponents (which isn't that agressive) are key concepts that are applicable to some No Limit situations however no self respecting Poker Author would ever sell those tactics as a ""winning strategy"" for other structures of Hold Em.Yes, Limit Poker can be very boring but considering that most players these days skip Limit and dive right into No Limit (due to the macho reputation of the game) they lack the technical discipline necessary to even beat even a loose low limit game, let alone a Loose No Limit game.This book should have been titled, ""Winning Low-Limit Holde'Em AKA how to suck out on your opponents""obvious but brilliant book"
4,Good for beginners,"This is a decent first book for a beginner and covers limit holdem. It gives specific instructions for what hands to play and basic advice on how to play them. If you were going to Vegas with friends or just joining a home game to play for fun and don't want to embarrass yourself, this is the book to buy."
2,hi hopes but doesn't work,i liked the book. gives you a method to play intelligentlyonly problem is it doesn't work. at least for mei have put in 200 hours in low limit play online and i have slowly lost my money.the other players are pretty smart at playing poker also and don't play like moronsi think the rake is the problem.anyhow the book is very good but don't expect to win at low limit hold emthe problem is that when you have a good hand you are limited in the amount you can bet. maybe in no limit hold em it is differenti'd say at most half my losses were due to my inexperience in poker. but even if gus hansen played with the hands i was dealt it would be unlikely he could show a profit.
1,Book fell apart,"After just a couple days of normal use, the pages began coming out. The book fell apart.I have taped and retaped."
3,"Useful, but dangerous","If you've never read a book on hold'em, this book is useful. It explains pot odds and various other poker concepts; however, it may lead you, as it did me, into becoming a tight, agressive, LOSING player. Hell, I use to win all the time before I read Lee Jones. I played every hand, saw every flop, lost a lot, and won a lot. Now I know all about position, playing quality starting hands, and all I do is lose. I lose with pocket aces, I lose with kings, I always lose with A-K. I lose to inside straights made on the river, I lose to two small pairs, I lose to idiots. This book made me a losing player and I still haven't figured out why. Unless you're playing against total morons, do not follow the advice in this book. Learn when to be a calling station, learn when to be a maniac, and you might become a winner. I'm still trying to figure it out."
4,If you haven't played poker outside of your house yet.,"This book gave a basic philosphy to start with. I've played poker & variations since the age of 2, so I consider myself a solid, intermediate player. What this book will offer the reader is a strategy on how to win at $3-$6 and $5-$10 tables. I have a very defined plan at the blackjack tables that I follow to the letter...I took the book's approach after reading it to my local room & walked away from my first $3-$6 game up $140. Not bad for 2 1/2 hours of play (same results not guaranteed, as we all know).Only problem I had with the book is that it was a slow read. But after going back through it a second time, I understood the major points the author was trying to get accross."
4,Thoughtful insight,"The two most important lessons that I've learned from this book is when to fold and the importance of position. Mr. Jones book has helped provide thoughtful insight as to what I did wrong on losing sessions, the things I did right when I won, and how I could have made more money when I won."
3,First Time At A Table,"When first learning about hold-em poker I bought this book along with a few others. This book is definitely geared towards someone who has little or no knowledge of hold-em poker at all. If you have played, know the rules, and the very basics of play, then this book probably won't add much. I've found the 1st Sklansky book on hold-em poker to be the best starter book. It's compact, but the ideas presented are immediately applicable and usefull. It provides basics of strategy on plays you can make, and also makes you aware of plays your opponent might be making on you. The Jones book is more basic, guiding someone through the first steps of the rules of hold em and playing at a table. Good for an absolute beginner, but for someone who has played even a little, probably not enough new info."
3,Book falls apart,A good book with some good information but the book falls apart as you read it. I've went through two copies and didn't even make it through the first chapter and half the pages fell out of the book. I would not purchase this book until this is fixed. Once this is addressed I would highly recommend the book.
3,"Not much changed from previous edition,binding issues","Overall I liked the book however I had the previous edition and there wasn't that much that was added for this edition, so if you have the previous edition of the book - you are good to go. The other problem I had was with the glue and the binding as the other reviewer stated. The pages are popping out of the binding. Otherwise, it still is a good book."
5,First book I read on Poker,"I bought this book about a year and a half ago. Read it twiceand took the plunge and bought-in at an online poker site for a total of $50 bucks, (all I was willing to lose). Well after a LOT of hands (tens of thousands) at the $10 and $25 NL tables, I am up close to $2,000 and finished 4th out of 485 people in a live tournament at a local casino,(only tournament I have ever played in), largely due to what I learned in Jones' book.But as Lee Jones writes; reading it will not make you better, DOING what it says will. It is not easy to be patient, and wait and wait and wait for the right time to push in your chips.Also, don't expect to be a pro at Texas Hold-em after playing 500 hands.This is a must read for anyone starting out in low-limit games. His book is right on the money. See you at the tables, (just let me know you've read the book), I'll give you a lot morecredit when you raise me!"
1,Disappointed,"This book is beyond disappointing. I expected at least a couple projects to make from fat quarters. It offers none of that. Don't bother with this one if you all ready know how to sew, quilt and make quilt blocks. There's absolutely no creativity here."
3,Chuck Issues,"When I first purchased this drill, I was quite pleased by the combination of light weight with reasonable power. Then, just out of curiousity, I bought a Bosch 9.6v ""Compact Tough"" unit, to see which one was better suited to bookcase and cabinet construction. What a difference! The Bosch, for the same price, has a racheting chuck, one-handed chuck operation, a much more comfortable rubber-coated handle, as well as no runout in the chuck (unlike the DeWalt unit). When you drill many pilot holes with a 1/8th inch bit, sooner or later the DeWalt will fail to grip the bit, leaving it stuck in the wood. I use mostly DeWalt tools and it's not pleasant to criticize this unit, but unless you only use hex-shank bits where runout and chuck-gripping are not so important, this drill falls short of the Bosch, in my opinion."
2,"Save your money, buy the Black & Decker","It's nice to see Black & Decker making thier Dewalt tools more affordable, however, they don't mention that this drill is practicaly identical to their Black & Decker 9.6 volt firestorm drill that is much less expensive. In fact, the DeWALT and the Black & Decker use the exact same motor & batteries, so told me the guy in the Black & Decker service shop. I even tried a Dewalt battery in my Black & Decker drill and it fit right in. Makes you wonder about all the other voltage Dewalt batteries.For this product, buy the Black & Decker firestorm and save some money. Plus, the firestorm has a rubber grip. It's much more comfortable."
1,Absolutely not up to the market standard,I have owned this Dewalt drill for close to 2 years. Less than 1 year the motor needed repaced after many months of motor bearing noise. The drill has only been used on average once or twice per week to install window blinds hardware and ocassionlly for drilling small diameter holes in wood. This drill is simply an overhyped and very over priced disposable product... I feel strongly that many of Dewalt products are much too overpriced for the qaulity one gets...
2,little disapointed,I went through alot of trouble to find this drill and when I finally got it I was please with the features and all but will be trading it in because I notice that my chuck has a wobble to it and so now I have to wait a week then trade it in. I hope the next one is ok.
3,actually a review (question) about the ad,"This drill ad contains the description ""jacobs chuck"". I would erxpect a ""jacobs chuck"" to be a KEYED chuck which is what I am looking for. Yet the photo appears to be a keyless chuck. Can you help me? Harry Wilson"
4,2nd Drill Owned,"This is the 2nd DEWALT 9.6v I've owned, as the previous one died after 12 years of use (and abuse). Able to take a beating, the 1st one survived being dropped from 3 stories up, and still worked fine."
3,"Elegant, but smaller than expected","At first glance this watch looks very elegant, with a nicely brushed steel. But, I was surprised at how small the dial was. The hour and minute hands are very shiny and almost flimsy-looking and the dial is very reflective too...add to that a beveled glass and you have a watch that is difficult to read at certain angles in bright sunshine. The luminous hands and markers are clearly visible in the dark and stay lit for a long time, but the round dot on the seconds hand is a bit confusing, since it is 30 seconds off (if you think that the rotating dot is where the seconds are, but then again, you may not care about seconds when you are in the dark). Overall though, a very nice watch."
4,aok car is running again so im happy and has been for a year now,"aok part. Car is running again, so im happy and has been for a year now. just be warned only one of these is for your car teh other 2 go to someone elses car so only use teh one for your car check teh amps and use teh correct one other u might burnup your car."
4,Great saw with minor improvement ahead,"You pretty much know how it is from other reviews. There are only couple of things I like to add from my experience using it. I wish the table top is wider to cover the legs, so when attaching things that are not as thin as the table top itself, the legs and frames will not get in the way. I need to make something to fill the gaps when attaching the extension table and sliding table (of course not DeWalt sliding table), because I can bring them to make direct contact to the table top. I also wish the dust port is straight instead of angled one."
5,woodworker,i have always tried to buy DeWalt products secondary to the quality. The saw appears to have good power and accuracy. The table enables one to use larger wood products with ease.
5,Charming!,"Lots of charming ideas for all your scraps! There are specific ideas and patterns, but also general guidelines to follow when creating your own folk art quilt. Fun!"
4,"Great arrangements, but not for beginners","I really like this book. The arrangements are very interesting and well presented. Although it's not a book for beginners, some of the arragements are well suited for intermediate players who are just starting to learn solo jazz guitar. Others, though, are challenging even for a fairly advanced player (which is what I consider myself). If you find this book too challenging, make sure to stay away from Morgen's book on Gershwin. Even the simplest of those arrangements are hard."
2,Not for Beginners,"... or even intermediates. I went through a handful of the arrangements in detail, and I found that the fingerings are much more demanding than necessary to perform any of these pieces. The flourishes and single-note non-melody material should be marked optional and instead is treated as essential, making the arrangements pretty, but also pretty tricky. Best for an intermediate guitarist, who is probably already able to make decent money gigging and who already owns a handful of fake books, who is looking for alternative arrangements."
4,Play Station Portable - Is it Worthy?,"Last year, I was contemplating getting an iPod and a PSP, and decided to go ahead and go on with getting an iPod as I am basically obsessed with music. However, I got a PSP for Christmas this year and am highly impressed with its features. It holds a fair amount of music (though not as much as an iPod) and has outstanding graphics available on it's small widescreen. It's controls are similar to a PS2's controller, and its wireless capabilities are outstanding. I have hooked up and played over our wireless internet connection similar to the way I have over XBOX Live, however, with the PSP, there is no subscription fee. Over all, the PSP is a great system, especially for on the road and vacation."
1,UMD drive problems,"The UMD drive stopped working in a year and one month after I bought it for my son, of course it broke after the warranty period. Sony customer support hung up on me when I told them about the problem, I called again and they told me to send $89 along with the PSP so they could send me a refurbished unit! I spent $249, not a great deal considering that the crappy unit broke so soon. On the other hand our Nintendo DS has been rocking for 3 years!"
3,?,It is a good thing that I know about computers because my son would have never been able to hook this up to the computer by himself.Also the game selection is horrible. Very few items to choose from
3,"Nice system, One huge problem ...","Here is the issue, I bought the PSP for long Car rides where the wife is driving. Natural Sunlight makes the high gloss screen VERY difficult to see. The system and games themselves are very fun. but playing outside could be more painful to the eyes than it should be."
3,Screen problem,"I returned my PSP, because in just three weeks, it started to have ""blackouts"". I heard the psp working, but the screen was totally black.the other thing i I think the psp needs is an internal hard drive."
5,heavenly slow movement can withstand a much slower tempo,This is a classic recording of one of the less approachable Bruckner Symphonies (no.2 conducted by Tintner on Naxos is the best place to start if you're not familiar with Bruckner)....it's all too easy to overlook but the slow movement of no.6 is one of Bruckner's most sublime creations and somehow i want to wallow in it more than Klemperer's relatively (surprisingly!)brisk tempo allows.Not that it sounds impatient but i'd supplement Klemperer with Celibidache(emi)who offers a much broader view without sounding indulgent in any way.
1,Allow me to disagree with everyone on this one...,"Let me keep it simple. I do not understand how this recording has achieved ""legendary"" status. I love Bruckner like no other composer--he is the greatest. Klemperer is a *magnificent* conductor--one of my favorites. However, this performance is a clean miss and, to my ears, unlistenable. There is a great symphony here, but you would not know it from listening to this performance. While I have not yet heard a performance of the 6th I would call ""definitive"", the best I've heard is Karajan's with the Berlin Philharmonic. I also really like Blomstedt's with the San Francisco Symphony very much. Celibidache's with the Munich Philharmonic is also excellent. Jochum's with the Bavarian RSO has an *amazing* 1st movement, but the rest of the performance continues at an unremarkable level."
4,Early 90's Country Revolution,The best Greatests hits by Holly Dunnyou'll find hard to download songs in this albumIf you like early 90's Country this is the CD for you
5,a must have in berlin...,"Berlin is a huge city which can, at many times, be very intimidating. The Rough Guide Series takes some of that alienation and fear away as it gives you a very thorough and concise view of the city of berlin.Aside from giving almost 100% accurate advice on where to eat, sleep, and party, this guide also keys readers in on some of Berlin's very vivid history. Taking Berlin, district to district, it is very detailed in letting the reader know where's what and how to get there.Without my Rough Guide, I would have been lost in Berlin. I wouldn't even have known where to mail my postcards from. The detailed maps and subway layout are excellent as well. All in all, this guide is great for a first time visitor (like me) or someone who is already familiar with all the Berlin has to offer."
3,not as good as expected,"They have a nice pattern that I liked because I had already done the walls with a ""space"" theme in my son's bedroom and these were for his first ""big boy"" bed. I liked the pattern but didn't really want to pay the price as they were kind of expensive for kids sheets. They are just not soft at all and after you wash them they are very wrinkly and it stays that way. I have washed them twice now and they are still stiff and wrinkly. I like the look of the pattern but not the wrinkles or the stiffness. For the price should have a higher thread count."
3,Solar system Sheets,I bought these sheets because my sons room is a solar system theme. I also bought the matching comforter. It all looks great but I washed the sheets and they are very stiff. They are still the best looking sheets that I could find for this particular theme.
4,A LITTLE BLUES HISTORY,"Buddy Guy plays very good on this video, as well the Saturday Night Live Band. What stands out in this film is the footage of the old Chicago Blues Clubs that have been closed down and their present day look. Buddy gives informative background on the old days, his perspective on the Blues and the role he's had. Playing in a small club you get limited camera angles, so I saw better footage of Buddy Guy at the Muddy Waters tribute on PBS. It's still worth the purchase though because he's playing more straight Blues, keeping the ""Hendrix Style"" to a minimum."
4,Very nice cabinet,"For some odd reason, my girlfriend begged me for a roll-around metal tool cabinet for Christmas so I bought her the Waterloo. Predictably, it sat in my shop for 14 months before I begged her to take it home. So I had a chance to use it for a while.It's a well-constructed cabinet and much nicer and more durable than my five-foot Craftsman cabinet (which she gave me for a house warming present in 1999). The large casters roll better than the smaller ones on my Craftsman and the drawer slides feel more substantial.This is a HEAVY cabinet so you don't want to be moving it from job site to job site. But for a shop, it's terrific."
1,cheap,"I thought I was getting a good deal and a good product at a cheap price, but instead I got what a paid for and nothing more. Cheap product at a cheap price. Only used a few times, literally 2-3 times, then one time when my girlfriend put the glass down on the table it broke and wine went everywhere. Luckily we acted quickly or else a bunch of carpet would have been ruined. They feel really cheap too. If you only want to use them a few times, get them, I know we will never get these again."
1,Broken Gift,I gave these glasses as a Christmas present and found out less than a month later that they broke after a few uses. How embarrassing! Go to Pier 1 and but them for $2.00 each.
4,Nice saw - needs a little more engineering,"This is my first table saw, having used a radial arm saw for 25 years. I wired it for 220 (which I recommend) and it has plenty of power. The fence is solid and accurate. I also recommend the mobile base which works flawlessly. In fact, I ordered 2 more of the castor sub-assemblies ($25) to put on other machines in my shop. Put the base on the saw first as it comes out of the box upside down - much easier.The dust collection system, although not bad, could be better.The worst design flaw is the hassle of having to take off the guard/riving knife assembly by removing 2 nuts down inside the saw. This takes about 10 minutes and would take only a few seconds if it was a ""snap-in-place"" design (which should be pretty easy to design, I would think)."
4,Shining Image Ultrasonic Cleaner,Very good product for the money. Does not perform like the commercial grade products I have had in the past but for light jobs around the house does well. I will purchase the same item again.
3,Don't get tricked!,"I was browsing to find eppisodes and this was the only thing I have. Unfortunately, it looks like I'm out $15; I was given 4 eppisodes I already have. Well, at least I have something better than a TV recording of one of my favorite eppisodes. :( But it seems good. I haven't actually watched it yet it looks like I can work with what I got. I love one of the eppisodes on this disc, and now I get the special features!"
4,"Hastily assembled, but remarkably cohesive and lovely","For what it is--a patchwork of different tracks from the early '70's--""Sugar Me"" sounds surprisingly like a cohesive studio album. The title track(also, curiously, recorded by Nancy Sinatra around this time)is kind of a lame tune, but ""Who Broke Your Heart""(credited to 'unknown')and ""You Set My Dreams To Music"" are blissful. ""You Don't Have To Be A Baby"" shows Claudine's playful side, as does the nearly-nude photo on the back cover! Claudine's singing career hit the wall soon after these sessions were completed, so it is her farewell performance. As such, it must be included in any fan's collection."
3,"listening to ""George Harrison""","There are 3 of Harrison's best songs on this LP - ""Love Comes To Everyone"", ""Here Comes The Moon"", & the former single ""Blow Away"". There are other decent songs like ""Faster"" but nothing special. Certainly not a whole album of winners like ""All THings.."" or ""Living In The..."". There is one song ""Not Guilty"" that is an old jab at Paul from the Bealtes days - in fact the Beatles recorded it for the White Album originally (and better). This LP is worth getting but if you want just the cream then just download the 3 songs I mentioned."
4,nice...very nice,"I see quite a few fans are overrating this one. Shouldn't we reserve the five-star rating for a work like ALL THINGS MUST PASS? This CD is not in the same class as ATMP. It's warm, and often quite beautiful, but not really a classic. That said, I enjoy all of the tracks. The woozy ""Soft-Hearted Hana"" bugged me when I was younger, but now it makes me smile. ""Your Love Is Forever"" is one of George's best ballads as a solo artist. ""If You Believe"" probably would've been a big hit had it been released as a single. Actual rating: 3.5 stars."
5,Another perfect album from George Harrison,"When you ask anybody to name all the George Harrison albums they know, they might say All Things Must Pass, Living in the Material World, Cloud 9, and Brainwashed. While all of these are classics, anyone who just owns these albums is missing a very vital album. George Harrison's self-titled album is his happiest, featuring an ode to newly-born son ""Soft Touch."" The track ""Blow Away"" is one of George's most famous non-hit singles. Even a 1979 acoustic re-working of the Beatles' ""Not Guilty"" (first released on Anthology 3, in 1996) is on this set. Your solo Beatle collection is incomplete without this essential record. There's even an LSD-inspired sequel to ""Here Comes the Sun""! Like the album, my review shall close with these encouraging words: ""Everything you thought is possible if you believe."" This album is pure gold."
1,SKIP it!,"Ok, Let's make things clear I am huge Harrison/Beatles fan who cannot get enough of them. But honestly, this is one document that just doesn't cut it. Talk about awful, pitiful lyrics that have no meaning and sometimes do not make sense. A lot of songs sound like no effort was put into them or they were improvised or were just there to fill a 10 song album. Production sounds just like a 1970's disco jam session, Harrison's guitar isn't even showcased at all and his chord progressions sound simple enough for Ringo Starr to play them after 6 months of lessons. Skip this and buy ""all things must pass"" which is the white album of Harrison."
5,My mother....,I gave it to my mother and she loves it!! She just loves Jimmy and thinks he a godly man.
2,Change not good,"I have purchased at least six Dewalt blades in the past and have been very happy, they cut good and I could have them sharpened a nmber of times which helps cut down on the cost. The problem I have is that the ""NEW"" tooth design can only be resharpened 1 or 2 times which does not help with the overall cost. I intent to send my latest order back and look for a better blade with more carbide."
1,Back to the drawing board,"Dewalt will have to come full circle on this blade. I used it for 6 cuts of 16 gauge/ 14 gauge..... 6 cuts! It threw multiple teeth. I am in the process of return and rectify. I intend to post how this works out. I have the Dewalt saw(DW 872) and the blade that came on it was sufficient for 100 plus cuts. I am aware of the manufacturers recommended uses. ....... No Sparks/just threw teeth......Sometimes defects occur, now lets see how the manufacturer comes full circle."
5,DeWalt Metal Cutting Blades,"I don't know how we got along before these blades and slow speed cut saws were invented, but if you're still using abrasive blades, you don't know what you're missing!"
5,quality blade,We have purchased over 20 of these blades through Amazon. This item is used frequently in our shop. This is by far the most competitive price I have been able to find for this item.
3,DVD-Audio missing subwoofer track?,"This album by Seal is just a classic, love all the songs to death, and Seal is a god-send vocalist in the pop world.I do have a 5.1 audiophile setup with DVD-Audio player.However, when I play this disc, I get no subwoofer track. (It isn't the player, I get sub-bass from everything else, including SACD.)Does anyone else have this problem? Or do you get subwoofer output from the DVD-A 5.1 tracks?Otherwise, this is very cool in 5.1 surround."
5,"Incredible, as usual for SEAL","The thing that strikes me about SEAL is that he can make every song on an album feel completely different. Most musicians stick with a particular musical motif for the entire album, until it becomes drab and boring. But not SEAL - he stays right on top, producing one excellent song after another by keeping them very various. As another reviewer put it, there is indeed something to strike everyone's fancy. Mine was Crazy, which I first heard on the album itself (I never ever ever ever listen to the radio, although I know it made it on there).I highly recommend this! It won't disappoint!"
2,"OK, but not a best buy","I like Seal as much as the next person, but I felt like this CD left something to be desired. Track 3, Crazy, was my favorite on the CD because of its fast beat, but after that there really aren't any tracks on this CD worth paying for. I recommend saving your money and investing in another, Human Being would be my recommendation."
3,...a grand effort...,"Bonnie Callaway has had a difficult time dealing with the tragic death of her husband and, although the accident happened two years ago, she still has not given love a second chance. So, when things start happening between her and her single pastor, Jeff Wells, she isn't quite sure how to handle the transition.Unfortunately, the attraction they were beginning to experience is shattered by distrust and betrayal. But as the compelling story of forgiveness continues, both Jeff and Bonnie are witness to lives around them being changed by forgiveness. Gradually, they are forced to recognize that, even as they urge others to love and forgive, they themselves neglect to do so.""To Forgive, Divine"" is a grand effort to illustrate the love and forgiveness of Jesus. Melissa Lea Leedom writes with both skill and sentiment. A recommended read."
1,Waste of time,Buy Ken Tankersley's In Search of Age Age Americans instead. Informative and pleasant to read.This book rehashes the history of American archaeology then castigates the author's perceived enemies unfairly. Both Vance and Tankersley have stated that people were in NA before Clovis. They just have doubts about the author's dating at Meadowcroft.
4,Fighting the p.c. mafia,"Adovasio's bitterness is understandable, since the Kennewick Man controversy made clear that the liberal, white-guilt, politically correct crowd WANTED whites to not be the first Americans, to NOT be native Americans, and to be cruel invaders of the land of the gentle Red Man. Clinton had the Army Corps of Engineers dump tons of gravel on the Kennewick Man site! By denying the Solutrean hypothesis, about which Dr. Dennis Stanford of the Smithsonian is writing a major book, whites of today are supposed to continue feeling guilty for ""stealing the Indians' land"" since 1492. Thor Heyerdahl's last two books -- such as ""The Hunt for Odin, "" and never even translated into English, although he was world-famous -- were also full of bitterness over the p.c. academic crowd ignoring his life's work, which proved that whites explored the Pacific on rafts in ancient times. When you make a solid case for 30 years, and are ignored, anyone would get polemical."
5,Stereotypes refuted!,"The First Americans by James M. Adovasio explains the scientific refutation of the Clovis-first theory of Native American origins. The book is well-written in layman's terms. Anyone interested in American and/or Native American history should read this book! Following in the footsteps of Thomas Jefferson, Dr. Adovasio has finally brought Archaeology into the 21st century."
3,The Clean Version Isn't Very Enjoyable,"I accidently purchased the clean version and it's terrible. Master P never had an abundant amount of curse words in his music but there were enough small curse words and the N word was used often. Some songs on this set are almost unlistenable, especially ""Hot Boyz and Girls."" Perhaps if some of the artists went back in the studio for this recording of the clean version it might be better but it's just a bunch of strange noises and samples or mixing or whatever they do to go over the bad words, I was very disapointed. Some rap albums are still decent in the clean version this just isn't one of them."
5,Great book of poetry your children will love,"I bought this book to go with an American History cirriculum and we read a poem every couple of days. Under the author of each poem is the date in which they lived, so I can say stuff like, ""oh look, this woman wrote this poem during the time when Abraham Lincoln was president"" and it helps tie everything together for everyone. Also, the poems are great fun and not boring at all. It is a really good way to show kids that they can enjoy poetry."
4,Classic game,"This exciting game will frustrate and challenge you until you until you play it enough to figure out your strategy a bit. Hint: Build small squares out towards the center, then spread to each side and wrap around to enclose the force field. Progressively harder levels will make this a very addicting game. It gets pretty hairy after level 8, but will keep you coming back. If you liked Pac Man, you'll probably like this even better. Shows colors on Color Game Boy, and looks OK on original (B&W) too!"
4,A Brief Review,"As an aspiring columnist, I found the book informative and discouraging. Good information on getting started, researching the market, making contacts. Discouraging about availability of opportunity and rates of pay. Disappointing that only three columnists were interviewed for examples, and that one, who writes for free, says he has tactics in place to keep all new people out. Whatever...."
2,a basic begining,"This is a good but very basic introduction to column writing. I was hoping for more. Still, it seems to be the only thing out there on the subject and it column writing is your dream it would do you well to check this book out."
2,Discouraging Read,"I thought the book was very discouraging to the readers. I think you can be realistic without saying - basically unless you are extremely lucky, you don't have a chance to be a columnist.I felt the book was always on the cusp of giving useful information. Then just before it was getting good, the author would stop short and start a new topic. I think the author could have gone into topics in a more detailed manner, instead of paragraph long diatribes on why this is really never going to happen for you."
4,this is about shakira!,"yeah, it is! there's not a bunch about columbia, it's about shakira! you get the info about her childhood, little known facts(she used to want to be an astronaut, did you know that?) people who didn't believe in her(her music teacher told her she had a voice like a goat) and info about her first two albums. The reason I give this 4 stars is because of the lack of photos-we could have some childhood photos here! Other than that, don't listen to the other guy, this book is worth a look!"
1,DO NOT BUY: This is not a minus-one,"Contrary to what is advertised, this is piano+orchestra performance, not a music minus one orchestra-only recording.It is a shame and I will try to get a refund."
4,This Wolf Rules...,"Maeniel has brought his mate Regeane and his pack into dealings with humans. They are the alphas of the pack. The setting is at the end of the glory of Rome and chaos abounds. Maeniel is a powerful and very wealthy lord now and his fortress is in a very important location. His cooperation with Rome is needed. There is more focus and background on the secondary characters than in the other two wolf pack novels, but they never shadow Regeane and Maeniel. Too bad this is the last novel about them and their pack to date."
4,A worthy continuation of THE SILVER WOLF,"This starts with Regeane's being rescued after an avalanche by a Saxon only to find herself and her rescuer in the clutches of a most evil group of beings. Here, we're first introduced to the Bear entity which at first appears purely malignant and evil, but is developed most interestingly as the story develops. As in the earlier book, we become involved in the political intrigues of the historical period.There's more humor, grisly though it sometimes is, in this book as the bear spirit encounters and then possesses Hugo. This humor is welcome, because the number of characters with their various intrigues does become a bit much, especially with a couple of inordinately long chapters that leave no convenient breaking points.There's less emphasis on the relationship between the woman Regeane and her wolf identity, and I miss that.However, fans of the original book should welcome this one."
3,Okay,"It was okay until the abrupt ending. There was a bit too much of the otherworld, but the characterization was good."
3,Disconnected.,"The historical fiction, the storyline, and the characters are all very intriguing. But I found this book a difficult read (and I've been known to finish 400 pages in a day or two). I had to go back more than once to reread paragraphs because the action changed abruptly, or because I couldn't follow who was actually speaking in a train of dialogue. There were also a lot of characters, some of whom just seemed to get in the way of the story rather than contribute to it. If these rough areas were smoothed out, I wouldn't hesitate to give it five stars."
3,It was ok.,"I thought it was simply OK. It seemed to struggle to me with so many characters and so many plots that there wasn't time to develop either. The style was all right, but I get the feeling that the editing just hacked it down to fit a certain page count. Because, if there were another 100 pages that might have helped with both characters and plot."
3,The End,"I never really cared for this story as it marks the end of two eras, one being Tom Baker's long, illustrious reign as the Doctor, and the other being the best Doctor Who decade. Gone is the trademark humor from Baker, to be replaced by mournful brooding. Now the show enters its most controversial decade, the John-Nathan-Turner-influenced 80s. Peter Davison and Colin Baker are good, but the last one leaves something to be desired, with poor stories. In addition, Anthony Ainley is a poor substitute for the late great Roger Delgado."
4,Final episode is a classic - other 3 episodes are average.,"This story is worth seeing just for the regeneration sequence, which is genuinely emotional and gripping.But on the whole, the rest of the story leaves something to be desired. It spends far too long trying to be clever and scientific and spends far too little time actually telling a story. And 'Logopolis' sounds more like a tree-house complex than a city.As a 'Dr Who incarnation's final story' this tale is certainly a vast improvement over 'Planet of the Spiders', but isn't a patch on 'Caves of Androzani'. The final episode of 'Logopolis' is first-rate, however, with the Doctor forced to team up with the Master (the two enemy Time Lords shaking hands is a classic doom-laden moment)."
5,Awesome and easy to use,I sing in a barbershop chorus and quartet. The problem is that I don't read music or play piano but I love to sing. I bought Print Music to help me learn the new songs......and the old songs since I am making a transition to a different part.Print Music lets me play all of the parts....or just solo mine....or just play Tenor and Lead....or Tenor and Bari...you name it. Once I learn my part I play the other three parts as background when I am singing. It is a very valuable tool to me and so far....and excellent product.
1,Piece of junk,"I found this headset hard to operate. The buttons are very small, and after several uses, it seems like it is broken. The display window doesn't turn on when it should. It was a waste of money."
3,It's good hindi movie,"Lakhan Singh strikes terror into the hearts of village people everywhere. But when his heart is tamed by a woman through her courage & tenacity who would believe it. So begins the tale of Samadhi a story of hardship & misfortune where Lakhan follows a pathway of self sacrifice to provide for his loved ones. But however hard he tries he cannot escape the shadow of crime that has blighted his existence, Happiness is always seems to be snatched away & replaced by remorse & anguish which forces him out of desperation back into the life of crime he was raised into. His only hope is to ensure that his child is not caught in the circle of deception that he is so effectively ensnared. If that means disassociating himself from the one thing that he values the most than so be it."
5,Georgous,This ring is wonderful. It looks excellent on my husband's hand and is definatly worth the money!
2,Drowning in chatter,"Maybe it's me. I thought The Friends of Eddie Coyle was a masterly novel, but twenty years later, this one drove me nuts. The long conversations are utterly unlifelike. I have never in my life heard conversations like these. And the windup is not worth the effort to get through to it."
5,Love good pizza crust?,"I use Barry Farm's high-gluten flour for making pizza crust. The high-gluten is what separates the great pizza restaurants from the dry, dense homemade pizza crust we are all used to. Replacing your standard flour mixture with Berry Farm's high-gluten four will give your crust that chewy, fluffy, and stretchy, texture that is so difficult to get with any other flour. You will not regret your purchase. I promise."
5,The best for Bagels!,"I only use this flour to make homemade bagels, and they turn out wonderfully every time! I don't live anywhere where I can get good high-gluten flour at a store, and this is relatively cheaply priced. It always arrives so quickly, too."
1,Terrible Flour,"Don't buy this to make bread it makes a terrible loaf of bread. The seller isn't nice either, stay away."
3,Best for selling Lean Six Sigma to your organization,"This book is an excellent overview of why Lean Six Sigma is relevant to service organizations, but falls short of providing you with the tools needed to implement Lean Six Sigma. If you need to convince upper management that Lean Six Sigma will work in your service organization, this book will help you make the sell using business terminology (e.g. Return on Invested Capital). If, however, your organization is already sold on the benefits of Lean Six Sigma and you need concrete tools and examples to help you implement, look elsewhere. I'm sure George's book would work well in a seminar sponsored by his consulting company, but as a standalone, it falls short of practical."
2,"A Confusing ""Knock-Off""","I liked the author's earlier ""Lean Sig Sigma,"" developed for manufacturing applications. ""Lean Six Sigma for Service,"" however, adds nothing for those seeking clearer guidance in improving service processes. For example, the material on Stanford Hospital very briefly covers an application, without detailing some of the essentials to getting key physician involvement and support; worse yet, the benefits and costs of the effort were not included. Thus, a reader would be unlikely to achieve substantive success. The material on Lockheed-Martin (18 computer systems to accomplish most everything) was interesting, but missed the ""elephant in the room"" - the prescribed ""fast changeover"" of screens simply covers up the enormous waste of 18 systems."
4,A 'not for dummies' product,"The book applies various Six Sigma methods and instruments to a services environment, placing an emphasis on services being a ""people's business"".However, the book relies that the reader has some basic Six Sigma knowledge, since the Six Sigma method is not explained by the author from the beginning, but rather apllied to a particular environment.I would recommend it for those people who believe that services are completely different from the manufacturing and ""what works there doesn't work here"". The book proves that it does."
3,A real sleeper.,"A must have for refining business practice, but don't look for excitement. More of the same, what more can I say."
3,Some Good Points,"I think the books offers some good points and general concepts on how Lean Sigma applies to service. However, the new book Pursuing Perfect Service does a much better job!"
4,Helpful to Anyone Seeking Ideas to Improve Their Work Flows,"Targeted at upper management levels in non-manufacturing organizations,this book is nonetheless useful reading for anyone, at any level, who isconcerned their work or process flows could use improvement to be morecompetitive or increase margins. Drawing on the same basics the authorexplored in his earlier work, ""Lean Six Sigma"", George takes on theadditional hurdles posed by non-manufacturing groups, where what tomeasure in a service process in order to improve it is at least asimportant as the improvement methods themselves. Along with technicaldetails on such measurements, George also focuses on the personal impactssuch measurements may bring to the workforce in a service organization.Here is good thought-provoking reading, a prerequisite to taking eventhe first steps of improving one's organization's flows and processes."
4,Very good book,"I think this book contains a very informative overview of the application of six sigma methodolgies for service. Very good reading for any professional interested in Lean Six Sigma. I also strongly recommendLean Six Sigma That Works: A Powerful Action Plan for Dramatically Improving Quality, Increasing Speed, And Reducing Wastealong side of it."
4,Cute book with bright and cheerful illustrations,"This book turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I'm not impressed with all of the illustrations (some of the animals just don't look right) but the bright colors make up for it. For toddlers who love to say ""no"" this book is it. My 20 month old loves this book, especially at the end when all the children make all the noises. The book also explains some characteristics of the animals, which I found to be a nice. It's definately worth at least checking out of the library to see for yourself."
2,Not so Great,Comfortable to wear but makes you look stupid (not like any ghillie suit doesn't but this one looks like a joke). Other than that it also looks pretty fake.
4,Am I Missing Something?,"I'm amazed at the reception given to this album by previous reviewers. Maybe it's a generational thing but I find his early work uninteresting compared to his sequence of albums starting with King Of America in 1986, including this one.I like his playful experimentation and embrace of pop sensibilities combined with very witty, clever lyrics. There is definitely an emotional depth compared to his earlier ditties: compare almost any song to ""Oliver's Army"".OK, not every song hits the mark but how often does a lyric sheet read better than the average book of poetry?There are several exceptional tracks - Unexpected #4 (which he may never better), After The Fall, All Grown Up.And even the ""weak"" tracks are interesting and fun."
3,Creative Arrangements,"I can't say that this recording is on the same level as My Aim Is True, This Years Model, or Armed Forces, but there are certainly many creative moments. The construction of many of the songs is quite detailed. Its seems as if Elvis tried to combine some new wave spunk with some Sinatra like baladeering. It does work to a point although some of the songs are a little drawn out. After The Fall, All Grown Up, and The Other Side Of Summer seem to stand out the most to my ears. You can't fault Elvis for being original."
3,Two great moments make this worthwhile,"On balance, this is one of the least interesting Costello albums. But there are two songs where he sounds not only committed but passionate.""The Other Side of Summer"" is the wittiest Beach Boys pastiche ever written; beautifully sung and arranged.""Couldn't Call It Unexpected No 4"" contains the best singing Costello has ever done. Just listen to the soaring passion that he brings to the lines ""So toll the bell and rock the cradle""."
3,"ummmm, well......",This is Costello's weakest album of original material. That sounds really bad until you consider that it's still far better than most artist's strongest material. Get it?
1,Only for completists,"""The Other Side of Summer"". That's it. That's the only reason you need this record, and you can get that on ""Extreme Honey"". If you're a completist, like me, then I guess you HAVE to buy it, but you don't have to like it."
2,Not his finest hour,"I am a huge EC fan. He wrote this CD in his bloated, shaggy period (literally) and I think it shows in the music. My least favorite of his work, few good tunes. Pass this one up in favor of at least a dozen other albums of his which are much better."
2,NOT a Must-have,"I found this one at a yard sale back in my college days, and thought ""WOW! Elvis Costello's latest CD for only 3 dollars!""Among the worst 3 dollars I've ever spent..."
2,This rose has wilted,"Sad, sad, sad. The decline of a once great talent. If you are a Costello fan, you will not enjoy this last gasp."
5,Mighty Indeed,"This album is musical, lyrical, and intellectual innovation not heard too often by today's artists. Any real Elvis fan definitely treasures this one as one of his masterpieces."
1,I did like it....,I liked this drill a lot until the clutch completely stripped out about a month after i got it. If it had continued to work like it did when I got it I would have no complaints.
4,"solid, all around performer","i am very pleased with the p-c drill. it has the power to do about every thing, the batteries dont drain down, and the ergonomics are great. one thing to watch out for is moisture. not so much the drill, but the charger. eventually, a carpenter is caught in the rain, just make sure to keep it dry or it will go to charger heaven.would have given 5 stars, but the 5 star rating goes to the 1/2"" drill. i recommend spending the extra [$]and have that extra capacity. if you are like me, the first time you cant chuck a 1/2"" shank bit you will ask yourself why didnt i just get the 1/2""chuck? the light is handy too."
4,"Almost, but not quite - how about 4 1/2 Stars","I rarely break out my corded drill after buying this great tool. The only very minor complaint is the chuck, which could grab a little better when using a hole saw, etc."
5,Fabulous drill,"Wow, what a drill! This replaced a 7 year old Dewalt, what a difference in battery life and balance. A fine quality tool. I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about for battery life, but in my opinion, these batts are exceptional."
1,the drill is a piece of garbage,i have own one of these so call drills for 1 yearand in that time i have had it repaired 5 timesfor the gears being strip 2 times for the clutchslipping finally the last time i took it in for repairsstrip gears again the gave me a new one guess what?two days on the job strip gears my trade is sheetmetalworker this thing is a piece of garbage
1,GREAT TOOL,"AS A WOODWORKER AND FULL TIME CARPENTER WITH MY OWN BUSINESS,I HAVE HAD MANY CORDLESS DRILLS FROM MANY MANUFACTURERS. THIS IS THE THIRD MODEL 9876 PORTER-CABLE I HAVE PURCHASED. I THINK FOR THE SIZE IT HAS EXCELLENT POWER AND TORQUE. I'VE TRIED OTHERS 18 AND FIND THAT THIS DRILL WILL DO AS GOOD A JOB AND IS MORE ECONOMICAL. IT IS LITTLE WEIGHT WITH GOOD BALANCE AND THE CHARGER KEEPS THE BATTERIES CHARGED WHEN I'VE BEEN USING THE DRILL AS A SCREWGUN ALL DAY. I HAVE MANY PORTER-CABLE TOOLS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS BRAND AS MY PRIMARY POTABLE POWER TOOL MANUFACTUER."
1,More clutch problems.,"First of all let me say that my experience is with a P-C Model 872, 14.4 V drill and not with the 9876. That being said I feel that my experience is so similar to those negative ones expressed here that it bears noting.I bought the 872 new in April 2000. The clutch has stripped out three times, most recently yesterday. P-C tells me that they cannot repair it under warrenty this time. What a piece of junk!Incidently, I am strictly a home user."
2,Returning a Flawed Product,"I've had my PC about 3 days now and putting it to good use on a kitchen and flooring remodel job. I've had 2 problems; one minor and one major.The minor problem is that the trigger has side-side play in it which effects the forward/reverse switch. There's enough play so that you can't use your thumb and forefinger to switch directions without changing your hand position.The major problem is the keyless chuck is trash. Drill bits, hex adapters, square drive and phillips bits literally fall out of the chuck when you place the tool pointing down!I'll be returning it and already placed an order for a new Bosch, my 2nd one."
4,Covers well and more natural ingredients than most,I purchased this foundation because it was rated as having fewer harmfull chemicals than most make up these days. I covers really well but is a bit darker than it looks in the photo. Works well during the summer when I'm a bit tan.
5,Shepherding a Child's heart fans will love this one,A great encouragment for parents. Younts uses Deut. 6 as the basis for encouraging Christian parents to talk to kids about God in the context of discussing everyday life. Easy to read.
5,EXCELLENT!!!,This book is great. It is great because it is biblical and very comprehensive. If you love your children - buy it! It costs so much less than one time eating out...
5,Awesome dragons,"You will want to make dragons all the time. You will learn a lot, read every word and begin an adventure."
5,Fun and easy to follow!,"I found this book to be fantastic! It's humorous, and the instructions are easy to understand and follow. She really does give lots of examples and ideas to help with creativity. The pictures are good, too. The book is a nice size; not too big and cumbersome, but everything you need to get going. Love the headings (pick your nose!)....I hope to see even more from this author than the three she currently has!"
3,"Dragons, not worms.","I like this book for the simple step by step approach. I also admire the author's other polymer clay books. Pretty much everyone I showed these dragons to though...thought the curled up shape with no legs reminded them of worms. Honestly, they remind me of worms. I don't look at this shape and think- oh! the legs are just curled up underneath! Legs are more challenging to do than this curled up shape, so perhaps this is a place to start. I added legs to mine and as someone relatively new to working polymer clay, found that separating the toes and getting them to look right took a bit of work. What I primarily learned from this book is how to make the eyes she uses for dragons. The eyes turn out really cute. Learning how to do that was worth the price of the book for me."
3,Not Quite as Expected,"As some reviewers already mentioned, this book gives wonderful photographs of the authors ""signature style"" with ideas for changes and creating your own unique style. The ideas truly are wonderful and whimsical. I didn't expect the dragons to be so flat though! I was expecting a true 3 dimensional sculpture-type dragon. Instead, the dragons are flat on one side. She does give some clever ideas for turning her flat dragons into nice (though large) focal beads."
4,Very Good on Scupting with Polymer Clay but a bit less than expected.,"While I did learn a bit from this book on sculpting dragons in polymer clay, I had hoped for a bit more than just the one dragon she sculpted for instruction. Although Christi Friesen offers a bit of extra instuction on different aspects of dragon sculpting, I believe she could have done a bit more in this 48 page book. Oh Well, I will say I enjoyed it and do recommend it to those who are fans of Ms. Friesen's type of art! A+"
2,"Gas Burners for Forges, Furnaces, and Kilns","I was very dissapointed with this book because I thought it would talk more about theory about building a propane burner for forges, furnaces, and kilns. I thought it would have calculations that I would need on making the burner I need. Instead it was a specific step by step on building burners from 1/2 inch to 1 1/4 inch with forge designs that the author thinks I want. There are various resources on the internet that give the same information. It gave no information about what the ideal fuel to air ratio needed or no information about turblent flow vs. laminar flow. I recommend saving your money and doing research on the internet. I tried one design listed in the book. I had to change it based on what I found on the internet and it worked better than there design."
3,Editor Required,"Great amounts of information for gas burner enthusiasts, however, the information must be gleaned by jumping back and forth between chapters...most confusing.Also, photographs may have been more use in some instances, in preference to line drawings. I still haven't built anything from the book as I'm still trying to work it all out.(Page flip/page flip)"
5,"Gas Burners for Forges, Furnaces, and Kilns",A must if you plan on making your own gas Forges! This book is great. I bought this after I made one but wish I had had it before. It would had saved me some money and time.
4,Lots of Info... Lots of Work.,"This book has all the information you need to build really nice gas burners. These burners are not cheap to build, but seem to work very well. All the information you need is there, though you get quite a work out flipping pages back and forth to gather it all.A large part of the book also talks about making devices to use the burners in like forges and kilns for pottery and glass. I found these chapters to be less useful than information currently found on the internet."
4,Tell 'em JR sent ya,"Simply put, you'll have a tough time finding a sweeter sax, better quality production and choice tunes on one biscuit. Don't think twice - just get it."
5,He is the best!,There are no words to describe this music - it is really wondreful! You must hear it. I am sure you all will love him as much as I do. SO go on. Do not hesitate - order it now. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!! I PROMISE.
3,An objective analysis,"...""Rose"" is excellent but besides one other track, the rest of the CD is formulaic. ..."
3,"only 4 good songs,but man are they good!","""kiss from a rose"" is the best song and that one and ""dont cry"" and ""prayer for the dying"" are worth the entire cd!Because of those,this cd is really worth 31/2 stars.He has got a great voice but i have to say i was a little disappointed that the ones i have already heard were the only ones worth listening to again.I was going to buy his other cds but after listening to this one i'm having second thoughts."
5,11 years later...,"and I'm still listening to this gem. To be honest, I bought this IN SPITE of ""Kiss From a Rose"". I hated that Seal was getting SO MUCH air play becaus of that song... not that the song was bad or anything, but I fell in love with his first album, and I thought ""Kiss From a Rose"" paled in comparison to tracks like: ""Future Love Paradise"" and ""Violet"".All these years later, I can still enjoy listening to this CD. I am writing this review because I just popped it in while at work. There isn't a bad track on this thing."
3,Seal,"Regarding the Seal CD. The second song was damaged. Aside from that, the rest of his songs were alright but would not purchase Seal again."
5,What a bargain,This was a great price for a great CD. I love it and I am enjoying listening to it every day.
3,good album,"There are a lot of good songs on this album like Kiss From A Rose, Prayer for the Dying, Bring it On and Dreaming in Metaphors. Don't Cry is the worst song. It's really bad in fact. He took a lot of that song from a Guns n' Roses song also called Don't Cry released 3 years before (I'm sure you've heard it, it was a huge hit). Guns n' Roses are awesome so I take it as an insult he twisted it into the garbage he did. But still there's enough good stuff on this album."
2,If you like bread stuffed in your ear ...,"I bought this album because I liked Crazy intensely for awhile (no longer) but this album is too much of a good thing (Seal's voice) which now makes his voice no longer a good thing for me. I hated the noisy repetitive Batman song but the rest of the songs are SO slow like watching someone take a very long walk on the beach (sounds good in theory, doesn't sound good aurally) or listening someone hum for an hour."
3,pretty realxing,This cd is filled with songs that are soothing and make you feel happy. But i think that God shuffled his feet id funnier and more relaxing. But this album is pretty good. It is perfect to put on if u have a date or if you take a bubble bath. But i suggest God Shuffled his feet for a date or bubble bath.
4,songs of the unforgiven,"I decided to give this cd a chance since I have all of ctd cd's this one is the same as ""I don't care if you don't mind"" all of these songs a very slow with the kind of a western theme no rock tracks here but the cd does offer a glimps of brad roberts vocal talents. This is a cd for an aquired taste keep in mind this is a band that does not do the same type of album twice the backing vocals of ellen reid on the unforgiven ones ,And So Will Always Be and others are fantasic. One would have to settle down and listen to the pure talent of this cd of course it's not from the days of god shuffled his feet but this cd itself has it's own style."
1,Apocalypse Now,"As one of the world's biggest Crash Test Dummies fans, I am very disappointed by this latest effort. While Brad Roberts' signature baritone is in fine form, the songs on this CD are extremely depressing. I actually like melancholic songs, but this is melancholy overload. A good title for this CD would have been ""Songs About the End of the World"". One or maybe two of these songs would have been OK if the rest of the material was more varied; the palate really needs cleansing after a few of these songs in a row.I agree with a previous reviewer that people with emotional problems should stay away from this CD. I'm a pretty happy person and it depressed me.This poor review has nothing to do with the band's changing styles - I don't mind that at all. But monotony is ""unforgiven"" and not up to the Dummies' usual quality. I found myself actually using the ""skip track"" button on my CD player, which I have never had to do with a Crash Test Dummies CD before!"
1,Hanging everything on a great voice,"Of course you get Brad Roberts's stunning voice on this CD. But that is about it. And it is not enough to carry an album.CTD has never been a pop band, but they did have some catchy, pleasing sounds beyond Brad's voice in prior efforts (actually 'God' and 'Worm' are my only other exposure). But this seems like Brad tinkering in a church, and little more. Too little for me."
2,"Dark, Depressing, and Boring","This is a very grim album from a formerly upbeat group. The music is unrelentingly dark and doom-laden. The wicked will prevail, the good will fall, forever and ever, Amen. What an album to record in a church!Individually, there are one or two worthwhile songs. I actually like the (sort of) title track, ""The Unforgiven Ones"", but the album has very little else going for it. Even if you like dark melancholic music, the songs quickly start to sound so alike that you often don't even notice that one ended and the next one started. This is a _bad_ thing.where are the Crash Test Dummies that produced ""God Shuffled His Feet"" and ""The Ghosts That Haunt Me""? I want them back!!!"
1,Gothic church music,"I love the CTD. WHen I realized they had a new album, I went to the local record store and paid full price and could't wait to listen to it. I was horrified at the fact that Brad lost his wit and sense of melody. I thought I was in church attending a funeral. I played it once. Some music deserves a second listen. I could not get through the first. It will be buried in my collection and most likely sold at a garage sale for fifty cents."
2,What happened to such a great band?,"The Crash Test Dummies quickly became my favorite band after listening to 'The ghosts that haunt me' and 'God shuffled his feet' albums. When I heard about this new album coming out, I was hoping for another hit. But instead I was quite disappointed. This new album is quite dark, depressing, and just plain boring. Brad has such an amazing voice and I'm not sure what happened, but I hope they Crash Test Dummies return to their original roots."
5,Reading the Bible,This book is a wonderful guide on getting more out of reading Holy Scrupture. It is like a recipe in how to live your life on earth with hope and peace and gain the reward of Heaven.
1,Good kindling wood,"I must say that of all the books that I've read from Chilton, this has got to be a serious joke. Those of us who buy these books buy them so we can learn the material. The way this one was written, it seems almost as if you wrote it for people who already know these things. I'm very disappointed in this book and hope that a revised edition will be published. Please make Chilton #1 once again."
2,Barely useful,Get the Haynes manual first.If you're doing major engine work and need torque specs then get this one.
3,What Can I Say?,"I owned an old Ranger and I bought this as a reference. There aren't a lot of choices without going into serious money. If I were a complainer I'd say what most people say, that it's more general than they expected. I found it useful to scan and enlarge specific sections that pretained to my vehicle. This brought details of the exploded drawings within my limited vision. I also found the lists of parts extremely useful as a guide for going to O'Reilly's."
2,Only basic info,This manual is good for general repair. If you need info on the 4wd look some where else. It has only a line or two about it. No diagram of tranfer case. No real help on wiring.
2,oxygen non kinking tubing,"The tubing listed as ""non kinking"" is a misstatement. I found that the tubing does in fact kink. I found that the more use the tubing got around the house the more it kinked."
4,Improving,"I read the first book in the series with a slightly jaundiced eye. While passably written, it lacked freshness and I felt too bogged down in the details of the differences between the different human races.Things improved noticably in this second book for me. There was less exposition and more focus on the characters. Particularly intriguing is the Yggur/Maigraith relationship-- I am genuinely curious to see where that goes.I still did not like Karan (the main character), which makes it more challenging to like the book. Still, I am in more of a hurry to buy the third book then I was to buy the second."
2,"formulaic -- chock full of lame-ass, improbable romance","Here's this book in a nutshell:Be chased by bad guys. Feel safe. Oh no! Realize that bad guys are on your trail again. Lather, rinse, repeat.Throw in a few interesting ideas, and then add a dash of the most improbable romance you can conceive.Why did I give this book 2 stars? There is a sinister magic to this series. Despite my critiques, I continue to read. Why can't I stop?"
3,Skil Drill,"the drill holds up under heavy household use however the batteries don't hold up as well under heavier use. The screwdriver bit constantly falls from the built in holder. Overall, it is a very good driver for a homeowner."
4,"So far, so good","Finally, our solution! We spend a lot of time shuttling cars from our 30 acre yard to our shop to cut body panels for our customers, because from torches to gas-powered chop saws, we hadn't found anything that worked efficiently and reliably in the yard. We had tried 18volt cordless recipricators, but the didn't have the stroke length or the battery longevity to handle many jobs. While this is a heavy unit, it works great in the field and in our shop with less limitations than our 110V Milwaukee. So far it has held up to our useage(more rugged than most)and the guys here that use it, love it."
5,THIS SAW DEFINITELY CUTS THE MUSTARD!!!,THE DEWALT 24VOLT CORDLESS RECIPROCATING SAW CAN GET THE JOB DONE.I REALLY LIKE HOW IT HANDLES WHEN YOUR CUTTING.UNLIKE SAWS I USED IN THE PAST THIS SAW CUTS LIKE NO OTHER & ITS GOT A REAL AERODYNAMIC FEEL TO IT .THIS IS BY FAR THE ONE SAW THAT CUTS ALL...........BUY ONE YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.....
4,not bad,"As a professional illustrator working on my first graphic novel, I went in search of reference material on some established techniques in comic art these days. I found some of the hints and tips in this book to be extremely helpful. The skill of the authors is readily apparent, as opposed to in a great many other ""how-to"" books out there in which the author (read: perpetrator) has no business teaching anything. I read this book at a store and have just ordered it, so I can't say how useful the accompanying CD is, but I'm sure anyone with a basic knowledge of photoshop will find it very useful."
4,"High quality stuff; if you don't have full version of Photoshop, you will be somewhat limited","If you don't have a ""full"" version of Photoshop you will have to work around some issues. The work contained in here is first-rate and superior to another competing title.Beautiful results and techniques; obviously very talented and professional and experienced people put this together. I haven't seen the new version, but the first edition is very well done. Recommended"
5,Tough but worth it!,"Densely written book. Sometimes ponderous reading. Nonetheless, it is so well written, so thought provoking and illuminating regarding the complicated events leading up to WWI in Europe, that it is well worth the effort of reading through to the end. In fact, even though it occasionally reads like a textbook, or perhaps precisely because of this, I will likely read it more than once and learn more each time."
3,Lacking in original ideas,"This is a fairly good assessment of the steps leading to war, but it is openly relient on other authors'. Read their more original books instead. Still, if you can tolerate the seemingly endless little chapters and the way they break up any developing story you'll find this book accurate. Thats important of course."
1,Seems like I have read this before,"While I much rather prefer to read about the U.S. Civil War and The Second World War, it seems that I have read this book in bits and pieces elsewhere. None of the information presented by Mr. Fromkin came through as especially enlightening to me and the majority of his main thesis - A localized dispute between the Hapsburg Empire with Serbia being used as a pretext for the German Military to incite a continent wide war - was not all that shocking. That coupled with the redundancy with which the author presented his argument would have me advise you to check elsewhere for another book on this topic."
1,Authors writing style cannot make up for his subject,"Look, I am not a great writer myself but I do know excellent work, his mans style is clumsy, stilted, the cuneiform of a jackaknape, the emu scratchings of a koala with glves on his paws.I cannot tll if he's trying to sound smarter beyond his eduaction and ability or if this is really as far as he can go...maybe he was having a hard time concentrating his attention on one thing....also, he uses trite words, phrases, his grasp of simple concepts is slippery at best and stifling to the point of death , at worst.Liberace could write better of Maori/British battles, Liza Minneli could write better detective novels, ...avoid this...go for Tuchman Keegan, anyone else....Ernst Junger..."
2,Interesting but flawed,"The origins of World War I are difficult for modern students to fully comprehend. David Fromkin is to be commended for writing a complete investigation of such a difficult topic that is both scholarly and accessible. Unfortunately, I think his conclusion - that Germany and Austria intentionally provoked the war - is highly dubious.Fromkin succeeds in building a case that the militarism of the German general staff created a situation ripe for war, and demonstrates that the assassination in Sarajevo was an excuse rather than a reason for war. Nevertheless, his conclusion seems to absolve the allied powers of any guilt. Interested parties should read Niall Ferguson's The Pity of War for another angle - Ferguson argues (far more convincingly, in my opinion) that it is the British and not the Germans who bear the greatest responsibility for the great war."
2,Back to the library!,"This is like a senior thesis, and not a very good one, from a student who has read only one book. It's argumentative rather revealing, relies entirely on secondary sources, and makes many statements that are unsupported by anything other than the author's opinion. I'd give it a B -- it is, at least, readable."
2,Disappointing !,"Repetitive and boring. Even though written in a logical manner to understand the reason of WWI, the author repeats himself again and again along the book. If you want an amazingly written and detailed book on this subject, I would strongly recommend Barbara Tuchman's ""The Guns of August""The Guns of August."
4,"Good background, context for the uninitiated reader","As someone who was always perplexed as to how a World War could start over the assassination of an Archduke, I found this book to be informative, well-researched, and enjoyable to read.The author fills in the details about important events preceding the war -- the struggle for world dominance among the European powers, and Germany's paranoia. His overiding thesis is that it was really all about TWO wars -- Austria-Hungary wanted a war with Serbia, and Germany wanted a war with Russia. Germany badgered Austria into punishing Serbia for the Duke's assassination, and the rest is history.Glancing briefly at the other reviews here, I gather not everyone agrees that this is a useful book. But as someone without a lot of background on the topic, I found this a well-written, captivating treatment about the context and events resulting in World War I."
5,My two year old LOVES THIS!,My two year old thinks this toy is the best thing in the world. It's so easy to get him to take a bath now! The crayons are great and come off the tub easily...I give him a hand towel in the tub and he wipes the desk and tub off. The compartment to keep the crayons in is good but a little difficult for my son to open. Thank you for making this!!
5,worth the price,"My 6 yr old son loves this one. He can draw and use his imagination, unlike the floating dolphin musical rings. It suction cups to the shower wall, has compartments for the crayons. Well worth the money."
4,"Great fun, but storage compartments are hard to open.","My son, who just turned two, heartily enjoys this toy.The only major complaint I have about it is that while it has compartments on both sides of the ""canvas"" for storing the crayons, those compartments are not easy for me to open, much less a 2-year old. The compartments have an indentation where one is presumably supposed to squeeze and open the chamber, but it doesn't work so well for us. This has actually become a little maddening and frustrates my little one. A small quibble, but it would be great if this toy were slightly modified to make the compartments a little easier to get in to."
4,Fun toy,"Like other reviewers, my 3 1/2 yr-old son had a hard time opening the compartments. The tip of the crayon did break off, but that's to be expected. All in all, he loves this; he also goes back and forth between the wall and the board. The crayon comes off both easily."
4,love this bath toy,"We've had our bathtub ""art desk"" for two years now and my now 4-year-old still likes it. It does float but we usually leave it suction-cupped to the wall. The surface cleans easily with just a washcloth and water. My only complaint is that the two doors - hidden under the outside purple and red ""crayons"" are somewhat hard to open. Not too hard though, just a little frustrating to tired little fingers at bath time.We have given these as gifts and would happily buy another if something ever happened to ours."
3,Fun,"I bought this for my 5 yr old niece and she thought it was ""awesome"" the larger crayons on the side hold the crayons when you are done using them."
3,Program Evaluation,"Book arrived quickly, in very good condition...like new. Easy to read, understand and follow the theories. Authors acknowledge that some of the information has quickly changed, especially the chapter regarding Management Information Systems (MIS). Still, required for the class so you know how that goes. Well written."
4,Useful resource,"This book is a great resource for program review, I used it in my graduate program and I'm keeping in my bookshelf."
3,Bullet Points,The Author is ver basic in his explanations. It helps get through the material. The book came quickly.
5,5 Years Today!,"As of today, April 1, 2011, it has been FIVE YEARS since my last cigarette (no foolin')! This program really works! I was a 2-3 pack a day smoker, and I completely quit in the 3 days it took me to read this book. I wasn't even totally committed to quitting when I opened the book!The program forces you to re-program your brain to not want to smoke. You will learn to visualize your addiction as a physical entity that you can fight, and you CAN KILL IT!The best part is that from day one, I could continue to hang out with my smoking friends. I neither want their smokes, nor have I become one of those annoying ""reformed"" people trying to ""fix"" everyone else!Thanks Allen Carr!"
3,Stop Smoking for Woman,"I was a little disappointed in the repetitiveness in this book. You don't get to the real 'Meat' of it till 3/4 of the way in. I understand that they are trying to reverse all the lies we've been told about smoking, hence the repeating so often. There is some use to this book for those that can understand it and allow it to 'work' for them. I just got bored with it. I suppose I might be looking for a miracle that will instantly work with no effort on my part so this didn't work for me. I hope it does work for those that read it."
4,It works....,"I used this book and the regular one. They are both good the other one was what I preferred it was a more updated version. I quit and am now so happy I have not gained one pound, that was my greatest fear. I was however active prior to quitting. I am now running and breathing so much better. The book works if you want it to work. You have to want to be a non-smoker more than a smoker."
2,Didn't work this time,"I have read Allen Carr, the normal one, 4 times. First time gave up for 2 weeks, which i had never done before with any other methods, and i found it reasonably easy. Second time, gave up for 6 months, still needed to be strong but pretty amazing for me. Third time and fourth time, read it twice to make sure i got it, 6 months. And i watched the DVD as well. Still found it a bit hard but not like any other attempt and enjoyed being a non smoker, but got sucked in again. This time I went a day and a half. Sorry. Just couldn't do it this time."
4,It did help me with smoking but...,"Yes, I can say that this book has helped me to stop smoking. Even though you are encouraged to not smoke that final cigarette until later in the book, the more I read-the less I wanted to smoke. I love the fact that you are not bombarded with the typical ""smoking is bad for you"" stuff. We all know that! The point is made but not shoved down your throat.As far as the second have of the title about not gaining weight, well I think the book fell short there. References are made to the eating smoking connection; however, I never felt that the book was truly talking about how to not gain weight.I would still recommend this for the smoking cessation benefits but don't read this looking to learn something about not gaining weight."
1,Smoking,"Unfortunately, despite reading this book twice, I still smoke. Allen Carr says that once you read the book and understand the message you will loose the desire to smoke. I wish this was true."
1,the easy way for women to stop smoking,"I was expecting more. It seems that is more or less the same with ""men"" stop smoking tips. It doesn't say anything about side effects on skin condition change etcI rate it as very poor.Thanks"
1,"Same Old, Same Old Stuff","This book is the same message he used in his former book on smoking. So if your looking for anything new, don't waste your money"
3,Good Read But I'm still a Smoker,"I was really hoping and praying and prepared to quit with this book. Lots of good info and it just changes your way of thinking about smoking. It's very validating and allows you to see a little bit more than you did before. However, I am still a smoker. I am set up to go see a hypnosis next week. Wish me luck."
5,Book by Allen Carr,"I am very impressed with the way the book is laid out. It is very straight forward, very informative and very helpful. He is very up front with you about why you are wanting to quit smoking and gives suggestions, but more than than that, its your mindset. Once again, it comes down to the very question, do you really want to quit??? If you do, then he gives very good information. He realizes that everyone that says they want to quit isn't ready. He allows for that. So if you are just interested in quiting smoking I would say read this book. It will help you make a decision. As he says, everyone has a reason for smoking. Some decide that that reason is no longer valid. If that is you, or would like it to be, read the book!"
4,helpful,"this book stuck with me in positive ways. i resisted it somewhat because it is not well written (repeats upon repeats) and i certainly needed the experience of other ex smokers more than this book. however, now - 5 weeks later i do refer to some of the tools. read it, but seek plenty of other support as well."
5,The best way to quit!,"This book is fabulous, I never thought it could be so easy to quit. I bought a copy just over a year ago. Today I am smokefree for a year, and I'm so happy I did it. I just bought a copy as a gift for my mother and sent it to her because she's been trying to quit for years without success. It really is the Easy Way!"
2,Disappointed,I guess I didn't get the point. I read the book carefully because I didn't want to miss anything but somewhere along the line I must have missed something. I'm going to re-read the book again and hopefully this time it will work for me as it has for so many others.
5,It worked for me!!!,"I finally chose to read this book, basically because I was desperate. I had tried quitting several times and never succeeded. I read the book without assuming it would work, but thinking that is was worth giving it a chance. What did I have to lose? I found it interesting, it made sense to me and in the end it worked. This was over 5 years ago and I have absolutely no desire to smoke again. It might not work for everyone, but I think it's worth a shot. It's definitely helped improve my quality of life."
3,True Funk,"I just previewed the tracks on this CD and was greatly disappointed that a Bootsy CD was put together entitled "".....The Best of Bootsy"" and yet one of Bootsy's most popular, dynamic tracks - ""Chocolate Stuff"" was not on this CD. There are a few tracks that should have been left off to make room for Chocolate Stuff! I'm very, very disappointed that this track is not contained on the CD, and thereby, I would only purchase it at a discounted price under $8.00. Bootsy himself should insist that the record company come again with another ""Best of Bootsy"" to include this track!"
2,ok,I love the funk but this was not a great album.Unless you really like bootsy don't bother with this album.Only a couple of great songs
5,Corny But Jammin!!!!,"Aah It's Bootsy Baby I love this cd and I love this artist Bootsy Collins no one can dress or sound like Bootsy but him he is the only one that can do it Bootsy can jam and be corny at the same time I love Tthis cd they are some jammin songs !!!! And I would recommend anyone who likes classic funk to buy this cd anyone who digs Parliament to buy this cd !!!My favorites are: Hollywood Squares, The Pinnochio Theory, Bootzilla, Stretching Out in A Rubber Band, I'd Rather Be With You, and many great others you definitely will enjoy!!!!"
1,Worst text I have ever used,"This book does an extremely poor job of explaining basic concepts. The explanations lack even more clarity because of the absurd amount of typos that occur throughout (the study guide contains several typos per chapter...and we're not talking grammar, we're talking wrong answers/formulas). I actually bought a second textbook for my chemistry course and found it more helpful than this one (and the course was taught from this text). Someone needs to A.) PROOFREAD THE TEXT AND STUDY GUIDE, and B.) DEVELOP REAL, LUCID EXPLANATIONS, not relate molar mass to apples and oranges. For anyone who is interested the second book I purchased was the one published by McGraw-Hill(and no I do not work for them)."
4,powerfull enough,"this is my first cordless drill, i have used this drill for mixing drywall compound, installing garage doors, works great on the lag screws, and installing metal roofing, and other various construction work. i rated it 4 stars because of the battery life and expense of a new one, i bought a new reconditioned one with batteries and case and charger for less than the cost of 2 batteries. also the first day i had this drill on the job a roofing job my employe dropped it 3x and it fell on a rock all 3x and didnt break so i guess its pretty stout"
2,burned,"I purchased the drill a few months ago and all was amazing. A little bit of a screamer but whatever. No big deal really. But now I am on my 3RD CHARGER and have to buy yet another battery!!!!! The power of this drill is great but ..., chargers and batteries are not cheap. At least to me they aren't. Too bad you can't combine DeWalt chargers with the Porter Cable drill. Then heaven would truly be on earth. If you buy one, make sure you have the extra money to buy replacement parts. Lates."
1,bad clutch/warrantee problems,"Recieved my Porter Cable Drill with much anticipation. However before I had even gone through one battery the clutch that controls the torque has started slipping even on the drill (highest torque) setting. Won't drive in 2.5 inch screws reliably. Other than this it worked great for about 200 screws. No 800 number to call about warranty, only an address to write to and have to pay shipping. Will update in a few months when I have a drill again.Finally after 7 weeks, got the drill back. Unfortunately is was not my drill as it had much more wear and tear that I had put on it with 250 2.5"" screws before the clutch went out. Also the battery they returned is no good. Too much work trying to get a working drill and not enough on what I bought it for. Still trying."
2,Not for tall babies!,"My daughter is 3 months old and has outgrown her ""bucket"" car seat. Since we no longer have the bucket to park her in in resturants and friends houses, I thought this travel seat would do the job.The stated weight limit is 25 lbs, my daughter weighs 15. Unfortunately at approximately 27"" she's already too tall for it.I'm not really sure who this seat would benefit. If your baby is short enough to stay in an infant bucket seat there's really no need, and if s/he is too tall for the bucket, this won't work either.If you skipped the bucket car seat and went straight to a convertible, this would probably be a useful purchase, particularly if you have a smaller child."
1,Not to good,"I did not like this seat, it is only for babies until 3 months max and at this age babies do not pick up or pull things to play so this toys aren't usefull. The fabric is a little hard and the seat doesn't bounce at all."
4,Handy little seat!,"We have used this seat around the house and to toss in the car for trips to grandma's, etc. It is easy to use and very light, so it is handy to take along. My 12 week old is happy in it, even though I have not bothered to put batteries in for the vibrating function. Drawback--his head is up near the top (he is just about 25 inches), so maybe he will grow out of it prematurely. He does not pay much attention to the rattles, but it will probably be nice to have them there when he gets interested in gumming and drooling on things other than his own hands. I recommend this seat!"

5,"Angels, An Endangered Species",Received in a very timely manner in excellent condition. Very pleased with the service even more than what I or my husband who it was for had expected. Thank you very much!
2,"As A lover of Mr.Goreys work I have to admit, this isnt so good.","I bought this book full knowing It wouldnt match up with amphigorey and amphigorey again, though by no means 'bad' it is certainly not on par with the three it proceeded. I would recommend this to a Fan of Gorey, but if you're a neophyte read the earlier works"
5,quintessential Gorey,"Only Edward Gorey can create a perfect blend of inscrutable morbidity with whimsy.His facility with invented words, implied horror, and exquisite art make for a timeless collection. I enjoyed the books as a teenager, and now share these with my daughter."
5,My Favorite,Michael Martin Murphey nails what Christmas in the country is all about. I love the songs. This is my favoite Christmas CD.
5,cowboy christmas,very good cd fast service great job cowboy christmas michael martin murphey play it over and over everyone love it
5,Cowboy Christmas,Michael Martin Murphy is a great Western singer and all of the music in this album is great. I would recommend it to anyone than enjoys Western music.
1,Not the actual complete Filters!,"These where not the actual complete filter, they are the strips left over from wrapping a larger hepa filter like mine. So they are unable unless your hepa filter is only 6 in tall!Contact them as well with Zero response. I guess the price was too good to be true."
1,Not a real Honeywell filter,"I was disappointed to see that this was not an authentic Honeywell prefilter, but a generic knockoff. Nowhere in the product description does it say that this isn't an OEM product. Terrible."
2,Prefilter 32002,I did not realize these filters were only 6 inches high. I will have to order additional pre-filters for our larger air cleaner.
3,"""new"" book wasn't new","I ordered a NEW book for my mom, but another lady's (from a state several states removed, even!) name label was in the front of it."
5,Great service - great item !!,Excellent service - received item very quickly. Great item also - received many compliments on bracelet. Would buy again from this company !!
4,THE SNUFF GARRETT SESSIONS!!!,"This cd has all the good stuff... "" Dreamin'"" ,""You're Sixteen"", ""It's A Big Big World"", ""Little Boy Sad""...all the LIBERTY sessions. If you are a Burnette fan..you gotta get this one..Johnny was at his peak, in his prime and never did sound better. Most of the cuts are in great STEREO."
5,Grrrrrrreat,"I love Swedish and other Scandinavian bands. But Asta Kask does stick out. From sweden nothing less than a great band. If you are into scandi hardcore check these guys out its a must. well hell any self respecting punkrocker should check these guys out. yes they sing in Swedish but i think thats cool when a band sings in their native language. other bands to check out;Appenix,Black Uniforms(although black uniforms didnt like astakask), Lama, Moderat likvidation, Mellakka."
1,Ripoff,"Sorry, but a lot of reviewers call this a definate collection. Nope.All of these songs are remakes done for Reprise Records in the 1990's. Remember, Freddy recorded for MCA in the 1970's when he had his biggest hits.Be very careful when buying Freddy Fender cd's. He re-recorded his hits many, many times."
2,Not the original recordings.,"Ripoff to call this ""The Freddy Fender Collection"" -- this is a 1991 session re-recording his greatest hits with a professional but passionless studio band. All very cautiouly recorded. Lacks the emotion and the fine instrumental work that his originals have."
3,Unsure,"I don't like to write reviews before a I use a product for obvious reasons, however I have owned a pair of these gloves before. I decided to buy new pair of these cause my finger busted through the first pair I had. These gloves are great, I use them very heavily working in the yard and they have held up for years.My complaint with these, aside from the unusually long delay in delivery time, there are some things that seem off about them. For one the color is not correct, I ordered Olive Drab but the color I received is more of a Foliage Green, not a big deal but also not what I ordered. Principally they seem shoddy, the hid leather is not as nicely stitched to the fingertips as my old ones were/are (there is an excess hang off) and all in all the gloves seem lighter, thinner, and less durable.I'm not sure if this is Blackhawk trying to save a nickel or some sort of discount knockoff/reject deal. I may return them or stick with them, I just thought I'd give others a heads up on my experience."
1,wrong size,"when i ordered these gloves, there was no size option. What i received was a small. since this was a Christmas present for my son, who is now serving in afghanistan, it was a great disapointment. He couldnt use the gloves, so he had to leave them behind. A right fit is important when you are driving a striker. I would not buy this product again."
2,"Tiny, no internal bacon","Just a small custard tart with a tiny bit of Canadian bacon on top. I like the bacon to be in the custard (and crisp), and that's the classical defintion, so this was disappointing to me, since I ordered it from San Francisco where I could not find good ones."
4,REMF,"An easy to read insight to the war in Vietnam. I've just returned from my second trip to Nha Trang and found much change and much unchanged since 1969/70. As a US. Army vet of the same time frame, I found much to chuckle about during the read."
1,Lost in London,"This is the most horrendous, unhelpful sorry excuse for a map I've encountered. Most shocking is its lack of an index of street names. Also,despite the enormous, individual blown-up maps of the London neighborhoods, the streets on them aren't all labeled. Finally, instead of overlapping streets on the edges of adjoining neighborhoods, the mapmakers apparently found it easier to drop them completely off the maps. I guess this map would work if you were going to the most obvious places in London, like Big Ben, otherwise, forget it."
4,Good writing but a perplexing story,"Very imaginative. Reading ""Light"" takes patience, Harrison doesn't believe in explaining much in the first few chapters, so you end up having to experience it. The writing is disjointed and not at all straightforward. The characters are NOT nice people, in fact they are pretty awful human beings. Harrison does give some explanation why they are the way they are, but I had no sympathy for them. Don't expect much humanity or compassion in this story, there isn't any. However, Harrison's wording and descriptions sometimes jump off the page--I couldn't put the book down. If you enjoyed ""Dhalgren"" by Samuel Delaney, then you might be the type of person that will enjoy this story. I haven't read Dhalgren in almost 25 years, but this book made me think of it.The bottom line, this isn't a book for everyone.Yes, I'm going to read the sequel ""Nova Swing""."
2,"A beautiful, empty glass","I agree with all those who said that it took at least 100 pages to become engaged with this novel. And that may not, ultimately, been worth the effort. Many, many of Harrison's sentences and descriptions are breathtaking. Those sentences, those descriptions, are so beautiful. Beyond those glittering things there is, sadly, not much else."
5,One of the Best,"If you like Banks, MacLeod, Mieville, Vinge, McAuley, Stephenson and Gibson, you should read this. As good or better as any of their best. It's hard sf, it's literary - it features rounded sympathetic characters, the vast scale of space opera, suspense, intense sex, lost loves, ghost programs, psycho killers, contract assassins, intergalactic carnivals, aliens, virtual worlds, a singularity, human-machine blendings, science funding battles, subtle pop references, condensed visual imagery, 3 different narrative streams...and a universe of ""more...and more after that."" Wow."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"World's most boring space opera.A story in three threads, one of which is set in the past with the people working on the breakthrough that allows humans interstellar flight and hence to be able to get to the strange bit of the book, the K-tract. This is the most interesting part.The other two parts - the reprobate character basically just giggles at saying fcuk a bit and runs across a procession of women with all the personality and use of blowup dolls.The K-ship captain character is a cipher until the end.One virtue is that it is short.If it is supposed to be slightly arty, it mostly fails, some of it coming off as second rate Eric Idle, even.One poor, and boring book."
5,Achingly beautiful,"Harrison returns to the form of his classic influential New Wave New Worlds proto-cpunk novel, CENTAURI DEVICE, and then some, merging it with the modes he has mastered in his more recent contemporary masterpieces, such as COURSE OF THE HEART. The characters are beautifully realized, the empty spaces in their hearts echoing the emptiness of the intergalactic reaches they explore, but ultimately the intricate infinite beauty and promise of those spaces is revealed. One of the few s.f. novels in recent memory that is such an intricate and mysterious puzzlebox, that an instant return trip should be even more rewarding than the first voyage."
1,Very Confusing,"Imagine if you will, turning on your high pressure garden hose only to find you havent got control of it. It slinks and sways out of control and you try very hard over a long period of time to grasp and take control of it.In the end however, when you have taken control of the errant piece of garden apparatus, the water authority then cut your water supply.Yes, I'm afraid thats the problem with this book. I couldnt understand a word of it until the 7/8 chapter until the threads of the tale started to become clearer and then by that time you have a grip on the plot (which I find disturbing). it ends.It would be better to read the other reviews of this book seriously before making a purchase."
2,A rather dull book,"It's rare I don't finish a book, especially one that comes so highly recommended, but I made an exception with this one. I found this book dull and disjointed and I just didn't have the patience or the time to persevere to the end. If you're looking for a compelling plot, interesting, well drawn characters, or plausible futuristic speculation, look elsewhere. I can't say I remember ""the graphic ... pornography"" another reviewer mentions either. Perhaps that would have made the book more interesting."
1,Juvenile,"I read sixty-one pages of this novel, the second half of these only because positive reviews hinted at something of speculative fiction value somewhere. Even if there is it's not worth the effort. The characters and their interactions are so insubstantial or banal, and their behaviour holds such little meaning or consequence, that nothing compels me to read any further. It might appeal to minimally precocious children."
4,Light,"The majority of the story appears complex as it unfolds, but blossoms into a beautifully written conjunction of the three main story arcs: three characters of different times and places, one the creator of the technology another relies upon, the other hopelessly intertwined with both. The inexplicable and deeply interesting events of the plot somehow follow one another into deeper madness, yet never confuse or put off the reader. The net result is an easy-to-read, intricately composed piece of literary fiction pretending to be sci-fi.Awesome: 8.5/10"
3,Almost 4,"Harrison's Light is a good read. Some of his ideas fail to cohere and leave the reader at times wondering what he's trying to convey, in terms of story. As a narrative, though, the underlying theme(s) and story are compelling. Execution falls a bit short. Still, I recommend the book."
2,A mash of poorly written good ideas,"The book has three good story setups ruined by an overdescriptive style and lack of a coherent plot. The story takes place in three future time periods.The first storyline is a modern-day Lovecraftian horror and really doesn't go anywhere -- even though this thread ultimately is the gateway to the stars for humankind. The second explores a fellow living his life through drugs and simulation tanks. The third explores the degenerative humanity of -- what is essentially -- a Guild navigator from Dune.If you can wade your way through the first 100 pages or so, a story eventually comes together but it's slow in coming."
1,"Tiresome Setup, Complete Lack of Payoff","The first 100% of the book is made up of vague sketches of the nonsensical situations of entirely unsympathetic and uninteresting characters. It does not give the sense of being complicated or difficult to understand, just that there is simply a lack of any coherence there to be understood. It is thoroughly unengaging, but rides on the promise that there will be a climactic revelation which causes the rest of the book to make retroactive sense.Unfortunately, this does not come to pass. The anticlimax explains nothing, and in fact only serves to explicitly disclaim explanation of many events. One is left with nothing but frustration at having wasted a few hours on such a pointless slog."
1,Beyond science. Beyond reason. Beyond your wildest imagination...,"According to the front cover, this book is ""Beyond science. Beyond reason. Beyond your wildest imagination..."" I would like to add, ""Beyond me!"" I just couldn't make sense out of this book. Other people seemed to like it, so maybe it's just me. The three plot threads connected in some vaguely interesting way, but the plots themselves did not hold my interest."
3,"Decent, but...","""Light"" is so well-reviewed that excited blurbs spill onto the front cover, with luminaries no less than Neil Gaiman and Alastair Reynolds raving about how good this novel is. I didn't think it lived up to the hype, but it wasn't awful. I agree with the reviewers below that its ending left a lot to be desired, and that the characters are uniformly unlikeable. Nevertheless, Harrison's prose style is interesting, and the universe he creates out at the edge of the Kefahuchi tract is imaginative and compelling. ""Light"" may appeal to fans of Iain Banks, another author who devotes particular attention to dark and depraved characters.I am unlikely to read this book again, and I am also unlikely to search out other books by Harrison. Again, I didn't hate ""Light""; it just left me lukewarm. Readers might want to check this out from the library rather than buy it blind."
2,Too much aimless wandering,"I stopped reading after 150 pages. There are three interwoven tales. The first of a serial murderer who wanders around trying to evade a supernatural monster, and his half-crazy ex-wife who seems to get off on the prospect of being killed. The second of a high-tech pirate ship that wanders around, kills a few people, tries to find out something about a mysterious device. The third about two men who only seem to wander around aimlessly. And the prose, which initially felt interesting, seems to wander around aimlessly, too. A pity, since a nice SF world shines through."
5,amazing,"Well, I think this book is a little deeper than most people are willing to go. Pun intended.I found it very challenging, almost boring at first, but eventually more than worth it. I will read it again because its oh so well written."
2,Ultimately unsatisfying,"The book starts intriguing enough - 3 different narrative threads with vastly different environments, which the reader is thrown into with no explanatory passages. The writing is mesmerizing at times with dreamy sequences thrown in for a good measure.All threads seem to be wandering somewhat but ultimately headed to some distant endpoint and each journey seems unpredictable and magical, until...The last 1/10 of the narrative comes hard and fast, tying in all threads, answering all questions in a hurry. Unfortunately, Mr. Harrison chose a 'nuclear' option, ultimately denigrating every player in the book, robbing them of any true reason and motive, making every event and every decision into no more than a puppet show.The answer to everything, it seems, 'it doesn't matter much'.And so is the book itself."
4,How can you be in three places at once...,"...when you're not anywhere at all. I'm in the middle of this fascinating book, and other than by reading the reviews on Amazon, I don't know what it's about. But I do know that the writing is wonderful, the vignettes interesting and often funny, and that it's engaging enough to keep reading. It feels like an extended Firesign Theater routine, not sure where we're going but enjoying the ride."
1,Stunningly bad,"I came to this book with no preconceived notions. I've enjoyed nearly every Sci-Fi book I've ever read, each for a different reason, and with an appreciation of each book's unique charms.For the first time in many years I am giving up on a book halfway through because I am utterly and completely bored and uninterested in the characters and the plot.The only good news is I borrowed this book from the library and this effort cost me nothing more than some time."
2,"Bleak and, at the same time, silly","I bought this book because it had cover blurbs from some of my favorite authors. One of the blurbs decribed it as an ""...sf novel twinned to a stunning mainstream novel"", which sounded intriguing. What it means in practice, though, is that there are spaceships -- and there is also a lot of dreary, disinterested sex, and all the characters are loathsome. Oh, well."
3,a mixed bag,"while the story, prose and principle mysteries of the three main characters were enough to keep me reading, all but one of the main characters resolutions were unfulfilling. i was especially disappointed with the revelation of the shrander who seemed almost omnipotent in one case, but almost a bystander in others. at the end of the book i really didn't understand the amount of space devoted to michael kearney's story, which turns out to be really rather meaningless in the grand scheme of things and could easily have been summed up in a prolog. the same could be said of seria mau, though to a lesser extent. as others have brought up, the only really interesting character was ed chianise , the book is worth reading for his story alone.then again, this book is about quantum mechanics and i'm not smart enough to even begin to understand QM. so maybe there is a wealth of relevance and resolution that i'm just not picking up on."
1,Run from this Book!,"I have a vague feeling that there is an interesting idea in there, but I threw this down after a few chapters."
3,Britcosmic adventure that didn't inspire me.,"I'm afraid I found this book a slight disappointment. If I was a newcomer to SF I might be more impressed, but I've read much better SF before...We have three interwoven plots here. Two are competent interstellar adventures with fairly amoral, possibly murderous, main characters that I found difficult to warm to. The third plot is set in present day England and the USA. This features a serial killer and I wasn't enthusiastic about him either.OK, each of the main characters has their sympathetic side. The interstellar ones are each missing a sibling, and the serial killer apparently only commits murder to cope with the ...entity ... that is poisoning his life. I did like his bulimic ex-wife - I felt like giving her hug and finding her a really kind boyfriend.But I've read too much SF that had characters I cared about and maybe even conveyed a sense of wonder at the universe. So I'll only give this 3 stars - and that's being generous."
1,So hip it hurts,"The author tries desperately to write an interesting, complex novel, but fails miserably. The writing is awkward, the characters unlikeable and uninteresting, and passages of misandry and misogyny pepper the novel without enhancing the plot (to the extent that there is a plot) in any way.Interestingly, the copy of the book I purchased was misprinted such that it started with page 19 and ran to page 50 before re-starting at the beginning. Ironically, I did not find this jarring given the random-walk nature of the narrative. In fact, it might just have improved this book!"
1,I must have missed something,"After hearing about all the rave reviews, I got this book and kept thinking I was missing something. It took at least 1/3 of the book before I could follow what was going on, and I kept hoping that it would get better. I never got pulled into his universe, and was left wondering why all these authors and publications raved about his book."
2,Challenging read,"I am a prolific science fiction reader and picked up this book because of a best books list in Locus magazine. I suspect that there were some interesting concepts spread out throughout the book, but it was very difficult to follow. Additionally, it is nearly impossible to empathize with any of the characters. Not sure how this made a best of list."
2,Too many oddities and complexities,"I just couldn't tough it out, and had to set Light aside. I'm a scifi lover, and the occasional cyberpunk book is great, but this novel tried to weave in too many oddities and complexities. Approximately a quarter of the way in, I finally decided this book was not worth the effort, and put it in the ""donate to the library"" box."
2,Not For Me,"This book had so many positive reviews, some from authors I like, that I continued reading it long after I normally would have given up. I kept waiting for it to become good, but it never did.The first downside of the book is that it doesn't really have a plot. Harrison just throws us into the life of three people who are loosely tied together in the last 25 pages. There's no progression, no story line. As one of the other commenters said, the plot is ""fractal,"" and I think that's a very good description.The second downside is that there's a significant amount of explicit sex. This is definitely an R-rated book.On the plus side, Harrison's world is well thought out and rich in details. His view of the universe is that it's so complex that no one can really understand it, and he does a good job of expressing this. The technology is also interesting, and ""Light"" is a good example of hard sci-fi.That being said, the positives do not overcome the negatives. I did not like this book."
4,Necessary for Biomedical Writers,This is a gift from the heavens for all Biomedical Regulatory writers. My experienced former professors consulted it in their work. Sorry I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is far from light feel good reading- it is the NIH/CDC/FDA.
4,Great resource for someone new to biologics,"I recommend this book for anyone involved in development, compliance, and regulatory activities of biopharmaceuticals. It's a solid reference book that walks you through the BLA submission requirements for different types of biologics/ biopharmaceuticals (e.g., rDNA, MoAb, gene therapy). It includes some examples of these sections but I wish there were more. The book does not go into much detail about Quality by Design - there are other good reference books for that topic. Also, don't expect glossy figures or diagrams. Consider this book the equivalent of a $1500-$2000 short course for ~$140!"
5,great intro book to lean 6,Go AIRSpeed! I suggest this book to all servicemen and women who are part of AIRSpeed. Great inrto into the world of lean thinking.
3,Lean Six Sigma,"Our organizations is implementing the Lean Six Sigma concept, so I wanted to read about it. What I have read so far, the books is intersting and covers the material very well."
2,Six Sigma does not exist,"For a completely theoretical concept of magical ""Six Sigma"", that makes companies to avoid risk there's just too many pages. There's a simple one-sentence proof against ""six-sigma"" concept: if an organization reaches such a level of quality, it inevitably stops innovating, because innovation leads to inevitable failures (even short-term) which will destroy six-sigma status. Once organization stops innovating and taking risks, it dies. Quite a self-destructing concept. Yet, interesting how many books will be written on it, and sold."
4,Good for beginners,It's the right choice if you want to have a quick and general idea of Lean Six Sigma.Strongly recommend!
5,great book,It is very informative with lots of useful info although the presentation was overly simplistic at times but well worth the time
4,Quick and Informative Read,This book would be a great starting point for anyone on the basics of Lean Six Sigma. It was a good refresher and also gave me some ideas on how to improve the standards and measurement I've already put into place. The book is sectioned off quite well so you can just breeze through it. Highly recommend for anyone looking for the basics or a basics refresher.
5,Supreme Storyteller,"George Flynn's stories touched my heart and warmed my soul. This book captured my attention, stirred memories from my own past, and enriched my reading experience."
5,GPX Alarm Clock Radio/CD Player: Excellent Choice,Very good product. Simple and easy to use/operate.
2,"Other than the CD player, just fine","I ordered this for my daughter (6) who wanted to wake up to music on the radio. As it's hard to find a radio station locally that plays anything appropriate for a girl her age in the morning (and music), I thought this would be the way to go. Unfornately, the CD player wouldn't read CD's. These were commercial CD's, not CD-R's, but the disc would spin and the player didn't read it. In the meantime, we found something else in a brick and mortar store so decided to return instead of exchange this model. Amazon was great about the return."
3,Good Price and Functional,"After opening the box I was a bit dissapointed due to the made-in-china (flimsy, fragile) feel of the product. The clock display is rather bright but I personally find it great when I have to get up in the night (keeps me from bumping into everything). It seems to work fine, with exception of the CD player having difficulty with some CDs, and being overly loud. I actully wake up to the sound of the CD starting and not the actual music, but it beats an annoying beep. You get what you pay for, lower price lower = quality product, but has met all my needs thus far, hence the three stars."
1,MOVE ON,"OK, obviously if you're considering this then price is a concern and you're trying to get something on the cheap... but trust me you can do better. This thing sucks, flat out. Shotty craftsmanship, utterly basic controls, no option to choose the track you wake up to, and the list goes on. Since purchasing this a few years ago I have moved away from CD's and gone to using my iphone with a docking station, but if you're still using discs trust that you need to spend a few more dollars to get something you won't want to throw at the wall."
2,not great,Does not allow you to play the radio at night without having to reset the alarm button for it to work in the morning. Controls for settings are tiny switches in hard to get to places.
2,Can't find the timer for the radio,I'd really like to know how I listen to the radio at night and have it shut off in an hour and then have the alarm go off when I need it. I thought that's what a radio was supposed to do.
3,Great device,I brought this device and my recent one was lost this is a great buy it was cheap easy to find online works great
3,CHEAPIFIED SPONGE,"This foundation is great, and there are no animal products used , no glycerin and all of that which is great, but their sponge to apply it is now a cheap piece of crap. I can't believe how rough it is, they ought to be ashamed of that fact.I may look for another foundation company for that reason alone. At a time where the economy is doing badly and they are making millions, to go and put this rock of a sponge into the foundation angers me."
4,"""REAL"" Power but No Clutch","This drill is so much overkill for 95% of the work you're likely to do. My Makita 12V is my usual side-arm. This DeWalt 24V is heavy, pricey, no clutch, and comes with only 1 battery. BUT, for that 5% when you need this much power, it is THE TOOL. Had to drill many 1/2"" holes through 4"" concrete. Went through like butter. The carbide-jawed chuck is a dream. My old 1/2"" drill spun big bits all the time."
4,24 volt drill,"this item is very high quality, but tends to get heavy as the day goes. also, i bought the item at the local hardware store and the case was not included. i went to the web site to purchase case and it is not listed as an accessory. how can i purchase the case?"
5,Solid for the tradesperson,"Solid performance... I am very disappointed that kit comes with only one (1) battery. Power is very good. I have used other rotary hammers in the field and purchased this unit due to cordless convince. I also note that after owning and using just about every major brand of cordless tools, this was my first DeWalt purchase. Pricey if used the AC/DC converter. Overall, a very solid choice for the tradesmen and weekend warriors who are involved in serious renovation/restoration work."
2,Don't buy this one.,"I like Microplane graters generally, but the plastic frame on the home series is not up to the job. On my grater, the frame cracked then broke after just a few uses. I think they should get rid of this one and stick with the professional graters with steel frames. I expected more. I emailed a complaint to them, but didn't get a response."
1,BEWARE !!!,"I couldn't figure out where plastic chips were coming from in the food that I was eating!! After looking around, I found that the plastic edges of these ""home series"" graters will crack and break due to flexing after a couple of months use. The plastic chips end up in the food.Additionally, the black rubber handle will slide off at the most inappropriate times and eventually get filled with food, which is impossible to adequately clean.Avoid these ""home series"" graters. Look around for something more durable and easy to clean."
2,not for me,I knew I was taking a chance spending close to 200 dollars of hard earned money for this. I watched it and found it to be boring. I tried several times to get into it but to no avail. I bought the e book with it on his website and it's essentially what's on the dvd's with no new material. Expect to see it on amazon as used in the near future. Then it might be worth it.
3,Muy pesados,"los zapatos son buenos, de buena calidad, pero el tacon es muy pesado lo que hace que tengas que hacer un mayor esfuerzo en la punta del pie con los dedos y te duelan despues de todo un día de trabajo con ellos puestos"
3,Tracklisting,1. We Don't Play Guitars (Album Version) (3:54)2. We Don't Play Guitars (Cristian Vogel Remix) (4:32)3. We Don't Play Guitars (Gerhard Potuznik Remix) (3:44)4.

5,My Dad LOVED this gift...,"My Dad couldn't put this book down to open the rest of his gifts! He love, love, loved it! If you know a history and travel loving person, it makes a great gift for them."
3,.....but this one fits in your pocket,"The Table of Contents of this book is nearly indentical to the ""Code of Federal Regulations"" issued by the Justice Department and provided free of charge to anyone who asks for it. But at roughly 6x9 inches, it doesn't fit in my pocket. So if the pocket thing is important to you, I highly recommend this book!"
3,Dora's Treasure Hunt Coloring Book,"The list price on the book is $2.99.Amazon charges $4.98 - some bogus built in service fee,of which Amazon informed me.This is NOT disclosed on the Amazon page.BUYER BEWARE"
2,Could be better,"I was disappointed when I received this watch. The picture doesnt quite portray it right. First the face of the watch is oval, not round as the pics implies. It's also huge. I have a pretty small wrist and and this watch just is huge. I was also disappointed with the embroidery, there was already loose threads when it arrived, and the detail isn't as cute as I thought it would be.Overall I was not very impressed, but I definitely would not purchase this for a child, the head will be as big as their hand, and with the oval shape and only 4 numbers it'll be very hard for them to read."
1,Not a multi-cutter,I own a muffler shop and the reason i bought this saw was the number of cuts you could get on a blade before it had to be resharped. You cannot get 1200 cuts from 1 blade. All we cut at the shop is 14 gauge aluminize exhaust tubing. The saw comes with a 70 tooth blade and i have bought 1 90 tooth blade and dewalt sent me a 90 tooth blade. I get a averge of 125 cuts per blade. So to say the least i'am not happy at all with this saw. I own several dewalt tools and have no problems with any of them JUST THIS ONE
1,Recall on DeWalts DW872 metal chopsaw,"There are currently two flaws that have forced DeWalt to taketheir metal chopsaw off of the market until June. 1. There hyped uppositive drive arbor system is destroying the gears when the bladebinds. The blade has know where to go when this happens. This information is from a DeWalt salesmen alert. 2. The vise to hold the material to be cut is failing miserably. This vise does not hold it in place and sucks the material up into the blade guard and causes #1 to happen by binding and destroying the gears. Call 1-800-4 DeWalt to verify. It is still for sale on this site and I wouldn't buy it. Period. Also, Tools of the Trade Ranked this Model first in the March April issue even though it is under recall. When I purchased my saw from Amazon.com and I installed the blade it, would hit the base of the tool and not make it into the bottom of the cut. I had to return it and have bought another model altogether."
2,Stick With Abrasive Cutoff Saws,"There are really two issues here: carbide saws for metal cutting, and this particular tool.The carbide blade has severe limitations. It dulls relative quickly under ideal circumstances, and can be wrecked on one cut if you hit a hard spot in the metal: most common shapes of steel are made from scrap, including ball bearings and spring steel. Only thin wall tubing seems to be exempt from this. Cutting thin wall seems to be the only good use for this type of blade.The tool itself is not designed or made that well. The base is cheap sheet metal and doesn't look like it will take a drop or any abuse. The clamping system does work, but the miter accuracy is compromised by the design. After putting out some big bucks for the DW872, nine cuts out of ten, I find myself using my old Makita 10"" wood miter saw with an abrasive blade."
2,Dewalt Better Stick to Wood Cutting,"This is one of the biggest disappointments in my 45 years of buying and using tools. The table is light and tinny. I have yet to get a square (top to bottom) cut out of it. It wanders to the right a good solid 1/8 inch while cutting 1/2 by 4 bar stock vertically. The blade that came with the saw lasted only about as long as a quality abrasive blade. Because of the great amount of time required for fit-up, due to the inaccuracy of the saw, along with the short life of the blade and it's expensive re-sharpening costs, I cannot see how this can be a money maker for any one. DeWalt makes excellent wood cutting chop saws as well as a good abrasive cut off saw, but I cannot reccommend this to any professional metal worker."
3,Cutting Metal Like Wood,"As a saw to cut metal I can say for sure this saw cuts metal like cutting wood. It even has something like very tiny metal shards from the cut, not an abrasive powder from a typical chop saw. This is a cutting fool. The only complaint I have with the saw is the terrible back fence design. Who thought it was a good idea to use allen bolts to loosen the back fence? It's sloppy when trying to adjust and hard to get an accurate angle. It cuts fabulous and leaves very little burr great for metal fab but the back fence has to go."
4,DW872 cuts cuttting time in half,I wish I had listened to others and bought this saw years ago. It takes less than half the time to cut than my abrasive saw. It has been going non-stop now for three weeks and the blade is just starting to show signs of wear. I would have been through an entire case of abrasive blades by now.The only flaw I discovered is with the keeper pin that the saw hinges on. It can work it's way loose allowing the blade to hit the frame. Only a small screw on either side of the pin holds it in and they tend to back out with vibration.
1,prefer her other books,One of my favorite authors but this book is a different style than her others. I dislike saga's but am fine with series. She is a deft writer but I could not engage with these characters. I don't enjoy sad stories for entertainment but this saga is. I skimmed the two books after bogging down half way through and did not finish either book.
5,This Movie Was Great and I Am In It !!!,"The concept was great, the performance by both the Beastie Boys & Mix Master Mike was awesome AND my performance made this movie worth 5 stars. I am the original ""I want two Beers"" guy and I can be seen at about 37 minutes into the film during the first instrumental. The only thing I want to know is WHERE IS MY ROYALITY CHECK ???SOLEY BKLYN NY !!!"
5,Great Show,"I have not seen the movie as of yet, but I was at the show that this was shot. Honestly the best show I've seen. Should be a great movie...enjoy"
5,Beasties Rule,"I have seen the Beastie Boys 8 times, and every show has been great. Well, this does not disappoint. The sound quality is good. The different angles are cool, but the cutaways can be annoying at times because you basically want to see the B-Boys perform not a panning of the crowd. With that said, this is the closest thing that you can get to being at a show, and with the passing of Adam this may be the ONLY way to see them perform.... Get it"
1,Neither Torah nor toons,"Aside from being deviod of any Torah content, the ""toons"" are not toons at all but rather a series of non sequitial collages that look like they were put together overnight. Actually, this book is so bad and anti-insightful I wish I could un-read it. One reviewer recommends to ""give [this book] to Jews with a sense of humour,"" I think it is more appropriate for Jews with brain damage. In one chapter (Toldot) the author writes how he got ""high with a little help from his friends"". I believe it; he must have been high when he wrote this atrocity to art, Torah and anything decent."
1,This Book Sucks!,"BS""D This book shows how very assimilated American Jews have become and how proud of it some of them are. It is heretical, uninformed, and an all around waste of money. Someone bought it for me not realizing what it was exactly and I ended up throwing it in the trash where it belongs."
1,What a Joke...,"I bought this tool several months ago, and I'm really disappointed with its performance. This tool is for light weight wussy work. Has no durability whatsoever. I was working with heavy duty concrete and after 2 months the performance was getting weaker and after 1 more month the engine burned. No technical service and I got no responses from my e-mails.I just got a Hilti Rotary hammer and this tool is kicking hard. I pay double of the price, but with this tool I can work for years without worry.Do Not Buy dewalt"
2,Jo Frost is Supernanny,"I'm very unhappy...the Jo Frost is Supernanny that I received is in some foreign language...I think Dutch....""EHBO - EERSTE HYULP BIJ OPVOEDEN""????How do I return this item and get my funds (plus postage) returned?Thanks, W. Bonnell"
3,Great practice CD,"I just started ballroom dancing a few months ago. In addition to my private lessons I took some extra salsa dance lessons. This was a great help for practicing at home between lessons. I don't speak Spanish, so I don't know what the artists are singing. But the tempos were easy to follow for a begining dancer."
2,great color horrible taste,"The burgundy turned out amazingly in this, it was exactly what I needed. Unfortunatly the frosting tasted stale and old, when I know it was fine beforehand. Work on the flavor, keep the great coloring."
3,Economical,"I purchased several of these to teach our aspiring tenor and bass drummers something about counting and rhythm in a bagpipe band. For the price, I was able to get a fairly good supply that several players could use around a table to practice counting exercises (Real beaters can be a little pricey for teaching some who may decide to drop out).The players quickly picked up the rhythms, and invested in their own sticks, but I still keep a pair of these handy for any aspiring drummers who have not yet invested in their own sticks."
2,Overpriced & Insubstantial,"I ordered this product and was shocked to see one little cheaply made mallet in the box given how much I paid for it. The handle is cheap plastic, the head is light, cheap foam. The whole mallet is really small and just completely overpriced for what it is. I might pay $2-$3 for it, but that's it."
5,Great addition to the Remo Drum Set,"My five year old son rec this from Santa and he loves it! Santa also gave him the Remo Bonogs, Konga, and the Remo Kids Percussion. http://www.amazon.com/Remo-Percussion-Diameter-Mallet-Forest/dp/B0002F7KUG/ref=pd_bxgy_MI_img_c The Percussion comes with two mallets. The Konga does not. It was a big hit with all age groups at the family Xmas party. I was going to purchase a normal drum set, but this is easier to store and transport for play dates."
3,medical treatment of down syndrome and genetic diseases,"This booked was recommended to me by a pharmacist friend of my husband.Heavy going to say the least but I found some of his studies quite interesting.It spans over 30-40 years of his work and how he treated down syndrome children with a coctail of vitamins and minerals.This book was revised in 1985 ,My thoughts are that with good nutritional diet and excercise anyone can reach there potential .I have lent the book to a friend and even though she is reading it she finds some of the language offensive and hard going.If like me you would like to give your child the best do read it but don't expect a miracle."
3,Not What I Expected,"I have been looking for ideas for a cabin I plan to build and live in full time. This book did not offer much along those lines. The variety of ""houses"" was surprisingly vast, but as far as structures one could actually live in it was slim pickin's. From an ice fishing shanty to a canvas house this was an interesting read, but didn't offer the sort of home where one would place the computer desk and hang a picture. As a collection it is interesting and sometimes fun. But I don't regard this book as much help for someone wanting to actually wind up with a place to call home."
1,Don't buy with Tiny tiny Houses!!,Unless Amazon made an error these books are exactly the same. I bought Tiny Tiny Houses a year ago and just discovered that the contents of A little house of my own is the same.
3,"Cute, simple inspiration","The houses contained in this book are small little testaments to human's need to have their own space. Although I don't own my own house, I hope that when I do, I can create my own little hideaway in the backyard. A writer's den, potting shed, a quiet place to think. The houses in this book show that square footage doesn't equal endearment.Each house is coupled with a short description, diagrams of how it is built and its completed layout."
2,Grandly Overstated,"This is an attractive book with lots of pictures. However, I was disappointed with the shallow treatment given to most of the houses. The author does explain that he is not presenting plans or architectural guidelines for the houses. But what is presented is a strange mix of information about each building. Some historical, some fanciful. Only the section about ""Camp Houses"" is dealt with in depth. It's an unbalanced book."
3,Nothing original to catch your attention,"This is probably not the most special album that you can find these days. Although a few of their tracks are catchy (""Camera Phone"" and ""Bust It Wide Open"" are decent), none of their tracks sound original or cutting edge stuff. Their crunk beats are very similar to other well-known artists, and if you have material from Lil' Jon, Lil' Flip, Nelly, and Young Jeezy, there's probably no need to add this one. If you're into collecting as many different rap albums as possible, then you can look into this one, but if you're more into looking for original material that will give you something different from the rest... you probably should keep searching. Although this isn't a horrible album by any means, it will largely depend on your preference of what you're looking for: If you want something different and special from the rest... keep searching, and if you want another crunk-style CD to add to a large collection... give it a shot."
2,"Too Old, Too Small","Ms. Parker's collected stories are certainly terrific, eventually. The print is so small, so difficult to read easily. This is a very old book using a font I've not seen since I was a kid. Really rather disappointing."
3,Not the same ingredients as the small bottle.,This large 240 capsules is not identical to the small bottle. It has a green label and the Lactase listed is only 200 vs. 300 lactase for the small bottle. The rest is the same.
5,AbsorbAid-Good Stuff,Settles stomach quickly without side effects. May replace missing enzymes due to antibiotic ingestion. Organic in nature.
4,A coloring book,"I realized when this arrived that it's really just a coloring book. There are two little stories and some educational content, but I think it would bore a child older than 4. It's good for my three year old nephew who is very proud of having just learned his colors, and the task of figuring out what colors the black and white images should be is a challenge for him, but I'm guessing he'll grow beyond it pretty quickly."
2,Death Dreams revisited,"As a fan of Christopher Reeve I watched this entire overwrought drama, but felt the plot was flawed from the start. This was about a foolish mother who stood by while her beloved child set out rowing an air-filled floatcraft alone, without a life jacket, knowing that the kid couldn't swim. How utterly stupid of her, yet we're supposed to believe her brilliant husband was madly enough in love with her to go beyond the limits of decency. It's a gripping story, tho, and beautifully filmed."
5,Powerful deliverance Prayer,This book is mainly an explanation of the series and how it works and what is to come. The power of this very short book is longest and most complete prayer in deliverance warfare I have seen. Praying of this prayer for 30 days will be life changing for many dealing with the dearkside.
5,Must have,"It revolutionized my prayer life and my walk with God. It's a must have! You'd better not loan it to anyone, you won't get it back."
5,Nursing,This is an amazing text book and has been quite useful to me. It is packed full of day-to-day useful information on almost everything you need to know about veterinary nursing.
2,Filler...,"The trio has fantastic voices, but none of the songs are that special. The only one I really liked was ""Come and get me."""
3,On the whimpy side...,"A good tool for light-weight work when a cord is just too much of a hassle. Struggles with medium-duty work. Just doesn't have the power of the usual 15A corded. Pricey, plus you'll need to spend another $100 to have a spare battery."
4,A well crafted suspense indie,"Four old friends reunite due to an urget plea. The police have found evidence that reopens a forgotten investigation. Now, after several twists and turns, someone is going to die, and take the fall for tragic events that happened twenty years before.A solid cast takes us through the story of what makes and breaks a friendship. The film effectivly uses flashbacks to throw us to the 1970's, where we meet a group of high school boys and then lets the violent events slowly unfold there. This is juxtaposed with the present situation involving the effects of the police investigation on our now grown-up foursome. A low budget does not hurt this intelligent film and it comes off without many rough edges.It had me guessing right up to the very end."
4,One of the year's best,"David McKay directs perhaps 1998's most underrated film. A film that headlined several film festivals yet never was widely distributed. Don't miss out on this film. Its a great mix of Stand By Me meets the Usual Suspects and the cast led by David Paymer doesn't disappoint. Finally, the assistant to the director, Ryan McNally provides a stellar performance as ""guy in car""."
2,It's junk...,"I love my Dewalt 746 table saw, but am not happy with either insert that Dewalt makes. They are terrible to try and level and even when you do get em level, they rattle. I've gone thru the whole gambit, made my own out of plywood, tried the Leecraft, they are ok. Finally found the Betterly Tru-Cut insert system and that is the way to go. Its a solid machined piece of high quality aluminum, made for this saw. That means you can still use your factory blade guard and splitter. It has a removable phenolic center, so you can make zero clearance inserts for about any size blade or dado. It's easy to level and stays level. You don't have to relevel when you change inserts, and the inserts are pretty inexpensive. Can't recommend the Dewalt inserts at all....toss em, get a Tru Cut."
3,Does its job.,The Dewalt Dado Plate does its job and thats all. I rated this product as 4 stars. I will most probably be using a zero-clearence insert instead.
3,weak batteries,"I purchased this saw about a month ago after much hand-wringing whether to get the Dewalt l8v cordless or the Porter Cable l9.2v. I finally opted for the Porter Cable l9.2, figuring it would have more power. The manufacturer touts that this saw will cut up to l25 2X4's on a single charge. NO WAY! 30 tops. I returned the saw after 2 weeks and exchanged it for the l8v Dewalt of the same blade size. The batteries in the Dewalt dont last any longer in the Dewalt and the Dewalt isnt as powerful. So I guess I should have stuck with the Porter Cable."
1,This product doesn't work,"I thought this Batter Dispenser would make it easier and more fun to make pancakes for the kids. Instead, it just dripped all over the counter making huge mess. I looked to see if my unit was defective and it did not appear to be. I have returned this and gone back to a soup ladel. The ladel works and makes it easier to spread out the pancakes. Save your money. This is a good idea that doesn't work."
5,"works well, made solid, easy to use and clean","We have used this 2-3 times per month for 9 months now, and love this batter dispenser. It is easy to fill, easy to use, doesn't drip, and easy to clean (just make sure you rinse it right away, so you don't have to clean out dried pancake mix). It is easy to make our pancakes come out round and uniform size each time."
4,V035-42000-U00 Batter Dispenser,"I am please with this product I tried another which look morefancy but actually it was hard to clean. This one holds a lotof batter, it dispenses quickly and is easy to clean."
5,Mason,"Excellent quality, much better than I had expected. If your a Perry Mason Fan, this is a must buy! Keep them coming......"
4,Beware use on BluRay,"I have had repeated problems with viewing these disks on a BluRay player. They work fine on a regular DVD player, but skip and sometimes crash on BluRay."
3,Otto's Danny Boy,"I've just seen ""The Case of the Hateful Hero"" and had to run the DVR twice to be sure, but I believe the character of Otto Norden, only seconds after hearing Lt. Anderson addressed as ""Andy,"" says good-bye to him and calls him ""Danny."" Can anyone help me here or am I just hallucinating? Thanks!"
5,THE VERDICT IS IN.. GREAT,"I received Season 6, volume 1 & 2 for xmas. I love the fact it's still B&W, they didn't colorize it.. still has that film noir quality to it. The stories seem a bit more involved, the plots a little more complex this season. All the old regulars are back, though Tragg has less screen time (due to health issues I'm sure) , and Sgt Anderson ""Andy"" more... My favorite episodes so far are ""The Bogus Books, the Capricious corpse and the Double entry mind"" (the scene where Sandover is racing up the company stairs with the missing deposit, while his boss is riding up in the elevator with the armed guards, is hair-raising) If I have one criicism, it's that some of the themes seem a tad redundant... several episodes involving long lost daughters vying for inheritance, ""dead"" husbands resurrected, fake uncles... but hey it's Perry Mason. It's like pizza, or sex or chocolate.. how bad can it be."
5,Outstandning Original Cast,Fantastic memories of Perry Mason remembered through this disc w/o having to buy a set.A very good variety of crimes on this disc.
5,Perry Mason season 6,"I really enjoy the old shows. I wish it was in color, but it wasn't. I enjoy all types of mysteries, both books and dvd. I especially like ones set in victorian times or early nineteen hundreds."
1,"Good, standard visuals but has nothing good other than this.","While this movie has good, standard visuals, its plot is paper thin, its loaded with filler and bad writing and its main character: Mitchell Mason is an emo bitch. This movie should've been about Vinnie Jones' character who is much more interesting than this film's main character. This movie sux. 0/10"
1,iRiver charger,The item didn't say that it wasn't compatible with Australia wall sockets.So i just wasted my money
2,Not believable ...,"I'm engrossed by esoteric studies, off-world philosophies, channeling, contactees, etc. Although the philosophical wisdom presented in this book does seem to be right on the mark in many ways, something just wasn't feeling right. Mid-way through the book I had the sinking feeling that I was reading a mixture of very good wisdom with UFO fantasy.So ... I decided to investigate the Billy Meier story directly and did some investigation into some of the Billy Meier source material - like Meier's video and photographic evidence of Pleiadian ""beamships."" After studying Meier's ""evidence"" I'm convinced that he's a hoax. And if Meier is a hoax, then this book can't be anything more than a philosophical fiction peppered with a few pearls of wisdom that can be uncovered from more reputable sources.Very disappointing to say the least."
2,The Pleiadian mission better than The Divine Comedy?,"absolutely! This book is quite good. It reads at a fourth grade level so everyone can read it and orgasm on its prolific messages! Although the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of Randolph's racism ranting. You think Im kiddig? On one of the pages he states that having white skin means you are higher on the evolutionary scale, or that you are more highly evolved. But other than that... who would of thought a book that costs less than $20 would reveal all the secrets of man including its origins, and simple rules to save our earth!"
1,Another Psuedoscientific Tome,"This book is but one of a number of works that claim unique info imparted to UFO contactees. Many contradict one another, and there is no way to verify the authenticity of any messages from the Pleiadians or any number of alleged Et entities. On the other hand, anyone who has read a fair amount of books on this subject can also find similarites in the claims. However, just because ten people tell the same lie does not prove what they are saying is true. With that being said, the contents of this book and others like it really should be taken in with caution, and should be considered a variation of science fiction at best. Besides, the most recent serious UFO research indicates a more ominous but more sensible explanation of the UFO enigma, offering much more tangible evidence than the evidence proffered in The Pleiadian Mission."
5,Best Scooter Ever,This is the best scooter ever made I love it. You have to buy it and get the warrenty
4,Tamrac Expedition,"This backpack has ample capacity for my gear, plus extra pockets for accessories and other widgets.It handled pretty easily on multiple flights,and was handy for carry-on gear."
2,"Nice DVD's, poor customer support","I got my DVD a few weeks back and discovered I could not read any of the files form the 1990s. I tried on several computers I have in the house and came to realize that the DVD is defective. I contacted Gitcorp about the problem and they informed me they would send me a replacement disc.Problem is that after nearly four weeks there hasn't been any DVD and repeated attempts to contact Gitcorp has resulted in no reponses.Update, after continued emails to Gitcorp, I finally got a replacment DVD. They didn't even ask to see the original bad DVD. So my rating of this product would go up if I could. If you buy the product, check it closely, and get in touch with Gitcorp as soon as you find any problems. They can be very slow about responding."
4,The third release in the (hopefully continuing) line of Marvel/GIT Corp DVDs,"This set is much like the X-Men and Fantasic Four sets previously released by Marvel/GIT Corp, so it has the same positives (over 500 comics completely scanned for a really low price) and negatives (missing crossover issues like Giant-Size Avengers, etc.). Spider-Man and Mad Magazine (a non-Marvel title) are slated for release soon. Other sets (Hulk, Daredevil, Captain America) have been mentioned but as far as I know have not been scheduled for release."
1,Technical Issues - I wouldn't buy this,"I'm having the same issues as the reviewer above - my computer only sees the 1960's folder. I have all the Gitcorp releases and this is the first one I've had any problems with. Very disheartening. Customer service has NOT been any help whatsoever. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THE TECHNICAL ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER.(The 1960's folder IS, of course, wonderful.)"
1,$170-$200!! Really?!,"Talk about price mark-up! Why are the X-men, Fantastic Four/Silver Surfer, and Spiderman DVD-Roms going for almost $150 cheaper. If anyone has actually layed down this much coin for the Avengers DVD-ROM I want to know!"
4,Bass Families,"The book arrived in great shape and quicker than I expected. Now, I just need to find the time & space to drag out my geneology paperwork and research some of my husband's ancestors. Thank you."
5,Excellent training resource,"I do a lot of human resources training in my work, and have recommended this book to numerous organizations. It is well written, and makes its points clearly and without unnecessary theorizing. I also have never before seen customer service presented from the perspective that the server isn't doing it for the customer or the company, but for their own sense of excellence and satisfaction."
2,Pretty elementary,"If you are a basic customer service person, not much experience, it's a good guide. I was looking for more depth for some research I was doing. Not a bad book, it just did not fit my needs."
4,Pretty good,"Pretty good overall. I was looking something for a little more than what I do now, and it seems to cover all the points in good customer service. But if you are looking for a much higher level of service, this one just describes the basics."
2,Super Service? Try Working the Front Line....,"...then you'll see how easy it is to give good customer service. I noticed most of the reviewers are managers and Human Resource trainers, not the people actually on the front line. Just try getting screamed at, cursed at, things hurled at you, and called all kinds of different names from an irate customer. Also try wading through the asinine company policies that tie your hands and keep you from helping the customer the way they deserve. Along with a lower than you can live off salary, and you have the average customer service rep and what we have to deal with every day.This book misses the mark in so many ways. It caters to people living in a dream world and have high enough positions that they dont have to deal with the public. But I'm sure they think this book's ideas are ""neat-o"""
5,Authoritative,"This is one thorough, authoritative tome on Fortran90. It is about as dry as one would expect of a reference manual, and yet it is not exactly succinct. I guess its wordiness is an unavoidable consequence of Fortran's longevity (backward compatibility with earlier versions of Fortran requires many a lengthy explanation)."
3,Epic Grinds to Jolting Halt,"650 pages into this 750-page historical sprawler, momentum is developing. The handful of parallel plot lines is drawing together, construction of the mega-fort to protect the Cape Fear River is moving ahead in spite of those anti-Carolinian machinators in Richmond, an ironclad is being built on the cheap and on the sly, war criminals are (some of them) getting their just deserts -- all is well! Then, in one of the most spectacular abandonments of one's own boiling pot in the history of historical fiction, it all just stops. If this is the set-up for a sequel, it will be interesting to see of the faithful reader is not too disaffected to buy it. Maybe Mr. Trotter died, perish the thought, and this was the best his literary executor was able to do. SOP would have been a 4 1/2 star historical novel without this odd, almost brutally truncated ending that leaves virtually every thread untied-down."
2,Very disappointing.,"I was glad to see the original actor back, but the story was absurd, and the tone was not the same as the first movie or any of the delightfully campy sequels."
3,not that bad,"this is not that bad of a film, it could use a little more orginallity or add something new that would not stray from the original movie. but still is enjoyable to watch"
2,america's critic,this is on the first season of criss angel so why waste ur money on this dvd--- just get the season 1 and 2
4,Decent dvd,"This is a halloween special of Chris Angel. Although it isn't as long as I was hoping, it delivers an entertaining experience."
3,Meh,The only thing that really impressed me was the last stunt. He has been known to set up the people and everything else but I gave a three star rating just for the last one.
2,A bit deceiving&#65533;,"This is a great book for those who wish to study Syriac script. I say that it is deceiving only because the title simply states ""Classical Aramaic"" and does not hint at what period is involved here (until you buy it of course). This book seems to lump the evolution of Aramaic and its periods together, then making the reader believe that it is spoken today just as it was in ""Jesus' time"" (which is false). It does outline the periods, but doesn't tell where this book fits in to it all. Great for Syriac script study, but that's about it."
3,complaint,"The screwdriver is good but the battery charger,that is sold with the driver, is no good. I had one for 1year. it failed , returned for a new ( which was to charge two batteries)double. they would not give me a new one.So I bought a single battery charger, it lasted two months took it back and Kmart did not have on. So I purchased the new driver complete. I placed the new battery in charger and the next day the charger had stoped working. A blister appeared on the side. I am sure others have had the same trouble that is why K mart no longer carries the skil. Why can't they design another charger. When the single charger is pluged in it makes the battery lay horozontal with ground. Bad design"
4,An easy read,I used this text in a MSW program HBSE class. It was easy to read and a good informative source on basic human development. Each chapter has questions and intensive vocabulary which was helpful.
3,belly dancing total workout,This video was fun but confusing. She would change moves without telling you how to do it and without any warning she was doing it. She did this alot when the camera wasn't on her so you were looking at the ppl in the back ground. It was fun but not very challenging (unless you count trying to figure out what she is doing now)
3,Fun book for kids.,"This is a fun little book for kids. I bought it hoping for insight on future living, but it doesn't include must detail for an adult. Big print, lots of pictures, not much info., young kids will like if he they are interested in the future. I wish it had more ""Jetson like"" ideas that would excite me and some kids."
5,Back Yonder in the Woods,An interesting how to on the use of old time hand tools and the projects they were used for. A wonderful look at how some of the old wooden articals were made by hand and the proper use of the hand tools to construct them.
4,Simon de Montfort by J.R.Maddicott,"Not read this title yet but I am sure it will prove to be an interesting and authoritarian read on such an important and enigmatic figure from Early Medieval English History who left such a lasting imprint and legacy: Although maybe more so in the US than here: I believe that in your country, he is cited as an important historical figure standing for devolution of power and founding the beginnings of a democratially elected parliament; a sort of for-runner to George Washington or Abraham Lincoln; certainly in the same vein."
5,Excellent value for the price.,"I purchased this for use by a speaker whose voice is being recorded while he moves around a lot. This equipment was easy to set up, and it worked properly the first time. (It's new, so I can't say anything about durability yet.) Someday we may need to graduate to something else, but for now, this seems to be working fine.I would recommend this to anyone who needs a wireless, hands-free microphone for general purposes."
2,Too weak for our use.,"This unit will not throw its signal far enough to reliably reach the receiver at a distance of less than 30 feet. We are hanging onto it to use for future video production in which case the receiver and transmitter will be rather close.The sound quality was fine, but past the 30 foot barrier, there were lots and lots of dead spots."
5,One of the best albums ever!,"This is one of the best albums in musical history. Every song is a hit. My favorite songs are ""Apache Rose Peacock"", ""Funky Monks"", and ""Suck My Kiss"". Those are just to name a few. This is a must have!"
4,They're red hot,"This is the album that features the Red Hot Chili Peppers ""breakthrough"" hit, ""Under the Bridge"". It's a great song, and there are plenty of other good songs here, too. ""Breaking the Girl"", ""Suck My Kiss"" and ""Give It Away"" are particularly good. If you like rock music with a ""funk"" edge to it, you should enjoy this album."
3,"Classic Chili Peppers, just kinda more of the same",Pretty good. I remember it sounding better ten years ago. I guess my taste in music has changed.
4,"Chilis' masterpiece, now REMASTER IT, already!!","Very few bands' commercial-breakthrough album just so happens to be their BEST album as well. 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' by the Red Hot Chili Peppers is one of these examples. 'Uplift' and 'Milk' serve as fuel for the arguement that their '80s material was their best but, realistically, they still weren't completely gelled musically; not just yet. Thanks to producer, Rick Rubin, the Chilis' were able to tighten up some more while expanding to their fullest range musically with this album, presenting an even wider collage of musical styles (mainly acoustic folk) than on previous works. With all their 80's albums recently remastered (hell, even the 'What Hits' CD sounds louder and sharper), it is beyond fair that BSSM soon be remastered as well. This is their best album! 'Under the Bridge' or no 'Under the Bridge'."
5,In myTop 10 albums of all time!,"Great grooves. This is RHCP at their very best. I listened to this album in 92-94 almost every day. Presently, I still listen to the cd every once in a while, only a few cds from that era has that kind of impact on me."
3,"Good Chili Peppers, but not the best.","Ok, I know practically everybody that enjoys the Chili Peppers says that this is their best cd. But, in my opinion, they are dead wrong. This cd is good at some points, but bad on a lot of points.Maybe, I am being a little rough on them, but I fill that all this cd is is them talking about genitalia, and what not. It has some songs on it, like My Lovely Man, where I just stopped and said, ""what the f*** is this?""I haven't actually listened to this cd in about a year though, so I will give it another chance. In closing I'll say not their best, but still a respectable cd."
1,blood sugar sex magik,The quality of this cd was deplorable. It was so damaged that even my computer could not play it. I tried to remedy the scratches various ways without success. I was very disapointed with my purchase.
3,"NOT A NEW ROCK ALBUM FOR THE WORLD, BUT NEW TO ME","I've been listening to the Chili Peppers for a decade or so now, and finally I've decided to invest in them; that is, in their sound, their musicianship. It's part of my method to avoid being influenced by industry bally-hoo. We're all victims of Spin in virtually every arena of American life. Half the cost of every product (and every political candidate) is publicity. Not to lecture. I don't buy the Peppers to affirm social theories; I buy the music for emotional and artistic stimulation and insight. What I particularly like is A.K.'s singing. The vocalizing of most men seems to me dull and uninspired, but Tony the K is wildly different. He's better than his publicity, with his unpredictablec but secure, hot fusion of Gil Scott-Heron's breathiness and Cher's andrognous trombone riffs, he creates a new way of singing and therefore of listening that I find fascinating."
5,The Best,"This is the most complete and well rounded rock album ever. Intricate guitar lines, complicated bass riffs, phat drumming and explicit lyrics. Even now, 8 years after its release I am amazed at it's brilliance and longevity. Along with Mr. Bungle-Self titled, The Clash-London Calling and Jeff Buckley-My Sweetheart The Drunk, an album that just about everybody should have."
5,This cd Rulz!!,"Ok I own 2 RHCP cd's right now (I'm just kinda getting into 'em) I own californication and this one (Blood,Sugar,Sex,Magik) I think their both just awesome. But I wasn't gonna buy this cd becuz of the parental advisory on it, then I thought I'd buy it anyway and they don't swear like A LOT! its not to bad, so I recomend (Can't spell it) this cd if u like RHCP, I guess."
1,Horrid sound,Do not download this album. The sound is terrible. The CD sounds horrible as well. Wait for the the re-masters
2,um yea...,"hmm... i was just introduced to this band a couple weeks ago not knowing anything really about them. After spinning this album once all the way through I couldn't really understand what all the hype was about? All the guitar and drum work was really fantastic but the lead singer... man, do i even have to say it? he just sucks. His voice is so annoying I can't get past a minute on any song listening to this no talent bum. I don't mean to offend but seriously...this band needs a new lead singer. And if he writes the lyrics too ahaha..wheeeew...that crap definitely has to go lol. Its ashamed to see a great band like this be hindered down by bad lyrics and vocals."
2,An Overrated Album From An Underwhelming Band,"I remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before ""Under The Bridge"" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album.For every song worth listening to (""Suck My Kiss"", ""Give It Away""), there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded. This album was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can.On top of that, the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief. Some friends and I got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album, and Kiedis was so off-key, it wasn't funny. They drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals, but the damage was done. People were walking out in droves."
2,Basicly A Waste,"Blood Sugar Sex Magik was the album with which Red Hot Chili Peppers broke through to a less limited music scene. By many, it is still considered the band's best album, so I looked forward to enjoying as many as 17 great RHCP songs.But no! Apart from the hits Under The Bridge (still a superb song!), Give It Away, I Could Have Lied and Breaking The Girl, plus the last minutes of Sir Psycho Sex, this album has not much to offer. The other 13 songs all sound like (unworthwile) imitations of Give It Away.This funk-rap-rock dominates the album - so if you are not into that style, buying Blood Sugar Sex Magik will be a waste of money. I recommend Californication, even though it is more commercial, instead."
4,Funkylicious,"The Red Hot Chili Peppers are one ecclectic hip cool band. And this is comming from someone who grew up on classic rock from the 60's and 70's. The steady bass and drumming coupled with the funky guitar licks and the varying singing/rapping vocals adds up to an excellent set.Many highlights abound ranging from the New Orleans driven Apache Rose Peacock to the politically liberal Power of the Equality to the softer tunes(Breaking The Girl, Under The Bridge, I Could Have Lied) to hard core tunes(The Greeting Song, Give It Away). I even like the speedy one and a half minute Robert Johnson cover They're Red Hot.This release isn't as melody driven as their By The Way CD. However, the funky stylings on this Blood Sugar Sex Magik release certainly can get your groove going. And that is certainly a good thing."
5,My most Prized Possession,I love this cd. I listen to it every chance I get. This is the type of music you would find in heaven. It has great funky songs like Funky Monks. Romantic songs like Sir Psycho Sexy. Beautiful ballads like My Lovely Man and Under The Bridge. And fun songs like Suck My Kiss and If you have to ask.
5,THIS CD IS HOT!!,"I love the energy that the Chili Peppers play with, their songs are so cool to listen to. It's a classic that should be added to your collection if you're looking for good music."
5,THE ULTIMATE REVIEW,This CD kicks ^^^! There are so many good songs I'm not even going to name them. This CD shows what the RHCP can do. Take my advice and by BSSM along with Californication.
2,yep,not my favourite bands...under the bridge has great lyrics! the vocals are terrible! the melodies are too much rap!
1,"Get ""Californacation"" or ""By The Way""",This may have one good song on it BUT there best? It doesnt thrill me.
1,Good lord! Is there any other album worse than this one?,"OMG I dunno where to start. First off, I'm a power/prog/thrash/80's heavy metal fan. Someone recommended me this album saying this is their best one, and that this is something metal fans might enjoy. Instead, I find this album to be one of the most ridiculous I've ever listened to. I don't wanna listen to even one song on this album again, and I've placed this CD where it belongs - the trash can. The artists sound like amateurs; the vocalist is god-awful, guitar sound is very muddy, and the guitar playing is bad, and the song writing is very loose."
5,My favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers album. 16 excellent tracks,"this was THE album that pushed the chilly peppers into the limelight. Do yourself a favour and just buy it! Its a blast from the past and a multi-multi-multi platinum selling album, It rocks the socks.. willy.. i mean... chilly willy :D!"
3,"Funky, No Soul","Ok three stars cause they could almost transcend their audiemce.Here's a missed opportunity. These guys are basically good musicians. The problem? They convey a know-it-all pessimism, an emotional armour so thick their funk never swings but stays martial.It's like the bandwidth of their emotion-spectrum is truncated and won't allow them to feel/convey either humor or heartbreak. There can't be any soul without the far-end of feeling. The quote ballad unquote ""Under the Bridge"" doesn't go nearly far enough."
2,I like the new RHCP,"upon reading a hateful review of their new album, I decided to chime in on thier older stuff. Apparently ""real"" RHCP fans like only their 80's funk and BSSM. I however loathe that stuff and embrace what they have evolved into. Stadium Arcadium is fast becoming my favorite album (though, I say that about every new album I like) while I still can't figure out why BSSM remaines in my collection, I listen to it every now and then but can't make myself like it, aside from the singles."
4,LOVED IT!,"I loved this album sooooo much!!! Right when I heard the opening track, I was like ""Oh yeah, this is good!"" This is the second RHCP's album I've gotten-after Californication-and I could not be more happy with these guys-they are fantastic.Every song is different, and each song is filled with emotion and real stuff.My favorite tracks are number 1 and 8.-Blonde In Black"
5,"Sugar, baby!","One of my favorites! Blood Sugar Sex Magik is one of the best records I ever heard, so I bought it. Fantastic album."
5,never sounded better.,I listened to this in whole (not hard to do I might add!) and I was blown away by the new bonus tracks. I always felt like rhcp's albums can go at least 2 or 3 songs more and I was right.... I just wish I bought these sooner. worth the digital upgrade and a must have for true fans.
5,Getting Business to Come to You :,"This is an incredibly useful book. Don't let the size overwhelm you at 685 pages, there is allot of great information in this book."
5,"A Box of Great Ideas, Especially For Small Business","This is a great book that can be read cover to cover or just dipped into for sheer inspiration and ideas that will prove especially useful in getting a small business either off the ground or to new heights.Even spending ten minutes reading a snippet of it is enough to give your brain a kickstart and point you in a new direction to look for business.It contains tried and tested methods for business development that are likely to prove very valuable, especially to smaller operators.It is simple and fun to read, also, which immediately puts it above many other books on similar subjects.I recognise that by this point since its publication, it could do with an update to include things such as blogging, etc, however for my money this is still an outstanding resource that is worth every cent."
2,Okay.,"There is so much information in this book that you will never need. It could have been broken up into a series of of book on different methods for getting Businesses to come to you. The title is misleading, because the businesses don't actually come to you. Like any other marketing strategy, you must go out and get business. I found it an interesting read, but a waste of time when it comes to getting business. Why? As you wade through this thick book trying to find information that will serve your particular needs or that of your business, you will waste a lot of time."
5,You will not be sorry you bought this book!,"If you own a business and you want ideas for marketing, this book is for you. There's something in it for the beginner and for the expert, and I don't think you could ever use all of the ideas it provides. I started putting some of the tips to use the day the book arrived (even before I had thoroughly read it--after just flipping through it a bit) and my business saw the results very quickly. I highly recommend this book, especially for small business owners."
5,Buy the new edition-it is well worth it,"I originally bought the first edition of this book several months ago. I wasn't sure I wanted to replace it with this new edition, but am very glad I did. Paul, Sarah and Laura have helped me focus and pick one thing that my business will be known for. As a professional organizer, I was trying to be all things to too many people. Now, I have decided to focus on paper filing systems for entrepreneurs. Being a paper organizer is easier than being a closet, kitchen, basement and office organizer. Marketing becomes so much easier with a niche.This book also explains that you don't have to use marketing techniques that are inconsistant with your personality. You don't have to make cold calls to get business, unless you like making cold calls.There are several tips on doing a PR campaign, putting together brochures, selecting a logo. If you have a small business, you will love this book."
1,Rubbish,Lots of talk about impractical business ideas and promotion methods. Hundreds of pages of empty talk.
4,Very different,"The book started out with a bang and didn't disappoint through out the book. One of those that makes you wonder and guess what I didn't figure out the end until the end that is a rearity. :) This book can easily be read in a day or two.Characters run from theories of Appocolips to Terristist, Can you guess which one it is?"
3,Christian horror?,"Other reviewers are right...the beginning of this book was similar to King's ""The Mist."" However, it quickly acquired religious overtones and, in the end, seemed to be Christian-themed horror. Can't say I've ever read anything quite like it. I kept expecting something other than where the story lead, but, oops!, it was angels fighting and God's intervention that saved the world. Not sure how I feel about it. The story was OK, and it introduced the Christian themes without being overbearing. Was the author actually sneaking Christian perspective into the horror genre? Worth the read? Well, there's certainly better horror novels out there. But this one is interesting, if only to ponder whether future horror novels will follow suit."
3,Mixed on it,"I thought the plot was intriguing somewhat and the ending was good but the rest of the story felt flat. People didn't seem to be freaking out as much as you'd think they would. It needed more umph. Felt like it was missing something but I don't know what.I wouldn't pay more than 99 cents for the story but if you get it for free, it is worth a read."
2,Two Star,"Straight off when I started this book I was reminded of Stephen King's The Mist. It had the same setup with the people being stranded inside a store while the world outside had become dangerous for them. I have to admit I liked King's book much better.This book was not a winner for me. I normally love Permuted's titles, but this one left me with a bland taste in my mouth. However, it was free and I can't complain about that!"
2,"Interesting idea, lackluster execution","Borrowing from The Mist and divine-being tales alike, this story reads like a lengthy plot summary, with flat characters spending their time in terror wondering aloud about who done it. Underwhelming, and my first disappointment with a Permuted Press title."
3,More like a quick breeze.....,"This was a quick read that reminded me of Stephen King's ""The mist."" I enjoyed the imagery this author was able to provide. Small details were scattered throughout the setting and character descriptions that made the story easy to relate to. My only gripe is that the ending seemed rushed.This was a steal for a free download!"
3,Good but not great.,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend and fellow bookworm. I have to say I thought it was good but not great. The overall story, pacing and incremental development of story was terrific. I also enjoyed the interspersed short chapters of accounts detailing similar disappearances, thus lending the story a more haunting and mythical feel. What brought the story down for me was the unbelievable narrator as a middle-aged American man. Ian as a character was just unconvincing, yet as a narrator was good. I found myself about halfway through really enjoying the story yet not really that interested in the other characters, Hugh and Laura. All in all if you enjoy detective novels and fantasy novels you might enjoy this one."
3,Lack of ending is baffling,"This is a quick and easy read. Only about half of the book deals with the main plot. There are smaller chapters interspersed that deal with the real mysterious disappearances of individual people. The story bounce back between the person the P.I. found and the one he is looking for, both abducted by a Sidhe lord. The main plot centers around the Celtic story of ""The Wooing of Etain"". She doesn't delve too deeply into folkore, but touches on it. This could have been 2 seperate books, one based on real disappearances and one on the fictional story.The ending was a disappointment, it's almost like the author just gave up. Not much is resolved and leaves you frustrated. I would have given it 4 stars except for the lack of ending. It was a very abrupt ending and could have used a few chapters of closure. All in all it was a decent read and I finished it quickly."
4,Needs some maps added,"Each chapter describes the battles the Mirage and Nesher pilots were involved in ... fine. But ... as the author has chosen to structure his book this way, each chapter needs a map at the start of it to better understand the huge volumes of text and photos to follow.Lots of great photos and incredibly detailed and extensive monologues of actual dogfights. If it had a few maps to get the text into context, it would get a 5."
3,Content,"I was disappointed with the content of the book. It is largely about the history and general principles. It did not get into methodology or details about polymers themselves. It may be good for the classroom, but is lacking for industry use."
1,Do NOT Watch This Movie!!,This is one of the WORST SciFi movie I have ever seen. Absolutely negative in script and scope. Beware and prepare to be totally depressed. No redeeming value whatsoever. I wish I could get my money back!!!
5,Tin Can is worth a look,"I reviewed Tin Can for the Chronicle, a weekly newspaper in Barton, VT, where some of the people involved in making this movie grew up and live. With local stuff you just never know and I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and found Tin Can to be well done and thoughtful, in the science fiction tradition of Ray Bradbury or Asimov, where it's not all about the action but about the people, relationships, the psychology of what is happening in the film. That said, it's also artistic and well acted. This isn't a Transformer type film or Zombies with lots of special effects if that is what you are looking for. I liked it a lot and was really glad to have the opportunity to see it and write about it for the paper."
2,Receiver,"This receiver was great as long as it was working. It went south after only three days of use. Rather than return it at my cost, DISH will replace it free of charge because of my protection plan. Beware of purchasing electronics online. You never know how the are handled. Of course, any electronics can go bad. That is the nature of the beast."
2,Very Dull,"From the sample, one might think this was a book of naval adventure. Not so. Its mainly long , long passages of dialogue between the narrator and a brilliant, but alchoholic, officer on a corvette. There are a few other tedious charcters and a little naval action, but it's mainly just these two talking about life. By the time the ship sinks, the reader is happy. The sample leaves the narrator in suspense, but it's in the first person, so don't worry. Much better books on WWII escorts are Monserrat's The Cruel Sea and Forester's The Good Shepherd."
1,One Tree Hill Pilot,Normally Pilots are a little different from a copy of the first episode of a tv show.. same amount of info only in a shorter amount of time and scenes and locations might be different.. not this just a straight rip from the first episode ever of One Tree Hill which actually has a name not pilot
2,Broke too soon!!!,"I was quite please with the self-cleaning system. Didn't shave as close as Remington Intercept I had before, but was ok. Unfortunately broke after barely a year of use! Now, I'm not sure what to do. I think it was battery, since it's not charging anymore. Shame, paid too much to see this happening..."
5,Best Shaver Ever!!!!,I reluctantly replaced my dying electric shaver and can't believe how much happier I am. The new technology on the Braun 8995 is fantastic. I shaved 3 days growth in no time.
1,Look Elsewhere--Or Else,"I bought this item less than six months ago, i.e. it's still under warranty. Last week the cleaning stand stopped working. After finally reaching Braun ""Customer Service"" today, I was informed that1) I would have to send it to a service center in another state2) It would take ""at least"" 2-3 weeks.3) A temporary cheap replacement would take 2-3 weeks to arrive4) I have to pay shipping to the repair location and make a long-distance call to them ahead of time to tell them it's coming. Who knows what's going to happen if/when I reach them.Try another company. You've been warned."
5,Worth the price,"I know it seems expensive for a shaver but you cant spend 50 dollars and expect a great shave consistently,i say consistantly becouse i have had cheaper shavers and their ok for a little while then they get dull or dirty cause you get tired of costantly cleaning them.This shaver does all it says it will do,cleans and lubricates itself(very well),it also has the closest shave i've found on an electric shaver any closer and it would take your skin off.You will feel good about this purchase,its high dollar shaver but well worth it,i guess its a personal choice how important is a good shave day in day out to you,if you like to stay well groomed with not alot of razor burn and can afford it buy all means get this one."
2,Not worth your money.,I got this for my fiance a couple of years ago thinking it would be easier for him to use rather than shave with a conventional razor every day. Not really. It's nice that it self cleans but the things become empty and then what? I didn't know if I could refill with alcohol or what. He barely used it as it didn't give him the shave he was looking for. It's been sitting under the cabinet for a year or so now. I would think you could get a better shaver for the money at this point in time.
2,"A fast shave, but still junk","If you're going to buy this, that's good because it does give a quick shave. It shaves very fast, but that's only the good news. The bad news is that it irritates my skin beyond belief, and it gives a poor shave. Not close at all, I give up I'm gonna throw this thing away."
3,Don't buy the Hype,"I purchased this razor 6 months ago because of the concensus by so many with tough beards and various dysfunctions, that this was the holy grail - well, I'm here to tell you, it is not - I have a $30 Norelco from Walgreens that does just as well - the hair on my neck grows in different directions near my adam's apple, this razor doesn't do a thing to them, even when I move around at different angles - so, if you've got ingrown hair problems or hair that isn't straight North/South, this razor isn't going to do anything for you that a razor costing $100 less won't - it's great for an easy shave, and nothing more, definitely not worth the money."
2,Not what I expected from Braun!,I have to say I am disappointed in the quality of this shaver. After 2 weeks of use the foil on the shaver broke. And it was not due to the type of use. So after examining the foil I saw that it was just to thin to do the job without breaking. So I was able to change it with a foil head from my old braun shaver which foil is thicker. So I fixed one problem! Next thing which is acting up is the digital LED. It is indicating different things which it should not. If it goes I will be returning the shaver for something else!
4,Pretty damn slick,"Not bad at all I say. Looks slick, and with a rechargeable base, I don't have to worry about getting new batteries from time to time. I shave about once every two-three days and the cleaning liquid has not been replaced. It does leave your face very smooth and my razor burn has decreased tremendously, but after the shave it feels as if my face were on fire, but I guess its worth it. Also, don't plan on doing any exercise after shaving for a day since it will really make your face burn."
2,Definitely not the best shave ever,"I had a Panasonic wet/dry shaver before I decided to give this product a try. The difference between this product and the Panasonic shaver was a full days worth of shave. If you like a close shave this product is not for you. Plus, you can't use it in the shower."
4,Close shave,After years of using a razor blade I was surprised at how close this electric shaver came to a blade. And it does it without knicks or pulling. The cordless feature is great too. I can use it several days without recharging it. I discovered that by forgetting to plug it in. The cleaning cycle takes a bit long but I start it after I've finished shaving so it's ready to use the next time. It's now my primary shaver.
5,Braun 360 Electric Shaver,I bought these (two of them) as gifts for my sons. They have used it for the last month or so. They tell that they are completely satisfied with them. They get a close shave and the cleaning mechanism is excellent.
4,braun shaver is very good,"The Braun 8995 provides a close, easy, and responsive shave. You will not go wrong with this product. The cleaner is very effective and may ""shave off"" a minute or two of your morning shaving routine."
5,excellent product,"I have a really tough beard. It cut through with no fuss, and made my face really smooth and clean."
1,Not Worth It,"The Braun 8995 sure looks fancy and a few reviews led me to believe that I would recieve a super close shave. Although that is not the case at all. I would say it worked a little better when it was new. I have had it for 10 months and I can honestly say it does not give me any closer shave than my $40.00 Norelco. The blade is recommended for replacement at 18 months. So that should not be the problem. Looks can definetly be decieving. I would definetly not recommend this unit. Oh, and the cleaning unit does not improve the closeness of the shave. I am not impressed."
3,"Works well, but not perfect","The Braun is certainly better than electric razors of years gone by. It's great for week-end touch-ups and as a travel convenience. While it does shave pretty close, I don't think ANY electric razor matches the close shave of wet-blade razor. I use the Braun for every day, quick touch-ups and convenience, travel and such and the wet razor when I need a really CLOSE shave. The cleaning system works well too. While it may be the best electric razor out there, it's doesn't beat the blade for a close shave. It's a great addition to a good grooming arsenal."
1,Clean & Renew base is POS,"This expensive electric razor was a gift I received Christmas 2007 and actually worked pretty well until the base station started falling apart. Since the stand broke I can no longer use it at all. Braun support was useless and wants $60 for another cheap plastic stand. After shelling out $$$$$ hundreds for the razor, new foils and cutters, cleaning solution (twenty bucks a month), etc. etc. it is obvious that Braun is a terrible money-grubbing company that makes cheap crap. Stay away, I know I will!"
5,Best electric razor I have used,The razor is great. Nice close shave without pulling. Cleaning is a little noisy and takes awhile. I have found that cleaning once a week is satisfactory.
4,"Nice shaver, but would my old shaver with new blades be just as nice???","I have been using this shaver for a couple of months now after receiving it as a birthday present. Prior to this, I had been using a Norelco-brand shaver. The ergonomics of this unit took me a while to get used to since this shaver is sort of rectangular shaped and the Norelco was more triangular (which I actually preferred). This shaver does indeed give a very nice shave, and the self-cleaning base/charger is really slick. However, I can't help but wonder if it really is the shaver itself or just the fact that it has new blades in it and would my Norelco be just as good if I had gone out and spent $40 on replacement blades?? Either way, if you are looking for a good new shaver, this is definitely one to consider - although consider saving some money and try putting replacement blades in your current shaver."
