3,Dogs enjoy,"Pigs ears keep my dog busy for minutes.great dog treat.This product is soaked in oils, I recommenddrying off before dog eats them."
3,Somewhat enjoying!,"This game is a pretty fun game. The 2-player games aren't awesome but trying to get the Championship a lot is pretty fun. The time trial modes are stupid because you prance around trying to beat easy scores made by this one freak. If you want a fun racing game, this probably wouldn't be a good game but still I think it's better than Hot Wheels Turbo Racing or that other Hot Wheels game they made for the PS2. This game gets boring after you play it after a few weeks but it's okay."
5,Plasmatics Valley of 1984,"One of my favourite albums,it is great! I loved Wendy O Williams,and this is some of the Plasmatics best! I am so glad to have found this album on cd! plasmatics will allways be among the greatest!"
2,Nowhere close to New Hope...,"This was the Plasmatic's second LP, and, while it's kinda sorta listenable, can't thold a candle to their first album. I remember when this came out, it was a major disappointment to those of us who loved the Plasmatics' music. It more or less indicated they were a one-LP band. Unfortunately, time proved that more than true. Stick with the first."
3,OK Game,"Its good enough to buy if it looks good,i gave it that rating because I think they tried a little too hard for the first Frogger for GBC and they just couldnt make one as good as that one,but graphics hell yeah but GBC Frogger is sooooo much better for gameplay."
2,skip this one,"I'm surprised this got an Editor's Choice, I'll be a bit more wary of that label now.If you're looking for anything like the original frogger, this is *not* it.I'm about 4/5 done, and the only reason I continue to play is to finish and shelf the cartridge. The game play is repetitive and dull. After playing the first level, you've pretty much seen all it has to offer."
4,Frogger,The plot of this game is to save the swamp that you live in from a man named Mr. D who has stolen all the elements (four in all) Your job is to bring back the elements and defeat Mr.D to bring back an element you must go through three levels the first you collect element stones usally two or three before you can pass on the second level you need five element stones to pass and the the thrid level you need to defeat the evil-doer who holds it. Frogger does not do the fighting instead he uses swiches or dodges the obstacle. The graphics are good and the game challenged me enough. My favorite thing about it is I can choose how many lives I have and how many play agians. All in all I would recomend this game to people everybody
4,frogger,"frogger is a really fun game,i got it for christmas last year this game shold be for 7-11 year olds"
3,too easy and not original,"this game is too easy and im a twelve year old, its not original and doesnt have the kind of thrill and excitement its just k nothing special,if i were u i wouldnt waste my money and would by super mario advance games instead, theyre much better"
1,Do not Get,When i sat down to play this game I found myself falling asleep with bornom. I could not stay awake. IF you like games that are fun for playing every night for 1 sec to put you to sleep then this is the game for you.
1,PLEASE....,it sux. never get it. u just hop around getting smashed by things. i played it once and hated it. im srry for the ppl who have it!!!
5,Love this book!,"I love this book...for anyone going through a difficult time in their life, this book is so very helpful. I actually ordered one for a friend going through a divorce and it really helped her...but its not just for divorce...helps you to identify some very important issues about yourself and has great advice. Once I opened it up, I could not put it down, and even went so far as to write the author who actually replied to my letter, signed it and all. Most encouraging! She has a gift. A highly recommended read!"
4,Excellent book,"Fascinating glimpse into the life of the Mexican immigrant. Wonderful characters, great storytelling of the family dynamics. Highly recommend it."
2,ok,The book was ok. I didnt like this it jumped back and forth between the two main characters bc then i forgot what happened when i last read about them. I expected more.
2,needs work,"They need to find an editor that has a eye for details. I found numerous mistakes, and references to sections of the code book that the code book editors changed. The book will help you learn the NEC code, but just reading the code book will do the same. The text book won't help too much on the state exam since you can't bring it in. The calculations sections relies heavily on a work sheet that you cannot bring into the test site. Its nice to have, but no use with the exam. The diagrams and illustrations have letter marking that have corresponding informational paragraphs, but i found them to be list in a convenient circular pattern instead of listed in an easy to follow line-of-thinking method. You have to have it for your class, so just pay them the money and work some overtime to pay for it. It is my opinion that it is overpriced."
5,Excellent Reference,"Of the many reference and educational books I have read, this is one of the best. This book, the NEC Code and Practical Electrical Wiring by Herbert P. Richter and Frederic P. Hartwell have given me a thorough understanding of the NEC and the essential things I wanted to know before wiring a new residence. Highly recommended."
5,Foodsaver v2860,"We've used a foodsaver device for several years. This is our 2nd device, and I am very pleased with the improvements. The flexibility of adjusting motor speed, internal roll storage and cutter, and the ""flip up"" design to minimze counter space while making the device always available are great. This device was well priced on Amazon, and delivery was prompt."
1,Hope it doesn't break - no repair,I bought this machine in February and it worked for only 2 months. When I called the company they had us run the machine so they could listen on the phone. We followed the instructions and when it still didn't work they said they would send new seals. We checked recently and were told they were out of stock and didn't know when they would have them. We asked to send the machine in and they refused to repair it until we put in new seals that we cannot get. And the rep was very disrespectful... I would not recommend this company at all.
5,Gave me amazing insights into relationship dynamics,"This book has been passed around among all of my friends and we're all heartbroken that it's out of print -- BRING IT BACK!!!!! It is so valuable, not just regarding romance but for ALL relationships in one's life, ranging from home to work, etc. It's outstanding. Highly recommend it."
2,generic,"I read it and can't remember if I decided to keep it on my shelf. I guess that's never good. The examples read like a reader's digest soap opera and are painfully generic, and painful to read! Other than that, I read it a week ago and already forgot if it was helpful. I think it had basic advice that was helpful for couples, as I recall, but the writing style was painful."
5,Outstanding!!!!,This book came highly recommended by a professional. It was an exceptional source of information about the highly complex dynamics of relationships and how life changes can have profound effects on them. My relationship has grown and my partner and I are both much happier and healthier both individually and collectively as a result of the knowledge gained in this book. Nothing but the highest praise and recommendation from me to anyone in a romantic relationship.
4,"Durable, useful","Gives your Dremel the ability to cut through tougher material than the standard cut-off wheels, and also lasts much longer. Use standard precautions, it does build up a LOT of heat and can produce sparks."
5,Rocks My World,"I've never bothered to write a tool review before, but this little bugger totally rocks my world. I was eating through standard and reinforced wheels like candy-corn, cutting ""eucatex"" (masonite) hardboard into irregular shapes. The awesome thing about this baby is that if you push it horizontally into your material it doesn't snap and send red-hot shards flying into your goggles, but instead actually cuts the material at the deflected angle! So hot!"
1,The Mayan Calendar,"The reviews here certainly have a wide range of critics. Just one thought. It's my understanding that things didn't end well for the highly advanced Mayan civilization sooooooo.... my question is... Why the heck would we want to model/listen to/heed advice from ect..., like, anything after them? Again , Just a thought."
2,What a total puzzle,"What bothers me about most of the reviews of books on Amazon is that they are written by staff of some publishing houses, whether for or against the book. They are mostly not written by readers. Just look at the time and effort put into writing some reviews.Ciao"
1,had high hopes but was let down,"I couldn't wait to get this book in the mail. After reading it I could have waited. I was really disappointed in the material. I found it to be about 5% information and 95% interpretation. This book was written by a Swedish Christian. That means that both Sweden and Christianity were largely the basis for that 95% interpretation. This book, despite the 'official' review, is nothing more than 'the end of the world is coming and so is the second coming of Christ' book. More specifically, 10/28/2011 is the end of everything we know today.I have one good thing to say about the book. The actual calendar information is really interesting. It's probably not worth your time to read through 200+ pages for though."
3,Some good parts worth the read,His work on the evolution of the universe in the 7 days and six nights makes you really wonder where we will be in the next 100 years.
2,A Bit on the Technical Side,"Textbook style, in-depth analysis of the Mayan Calendar and the formation of the civilization itself. Devotes very little to the prophecy as it realtes to our present day. Not an easy read."
2,Inaccurate description,"First of all - this appears to be a good quality case. However the dimensions in the Amazon description are in accurate. It says that the dimensions are 10.2 x 4.5 x 8.8 inches, but in reality it is 9.5 x 7.5 x 4 inches. I bought 2 of these to use as travel cases for sound equipment. I can't use either of them for the intended purpose."
5,First Time Upholstery,"I'm restoring an old car and decided to give a try at some upholstery work. I bought a full set of custom fit covers but needed the tools. Basically the only things you need are the Hog Ring Pliers, hog rings and a pair of diagonal cutters to bend the old rings off. I did some research and decided to give this set a try. Both the curved and straight came in handy, because I was amazed at some of the places they had hog rings. The set is very sturdy and the spring feature to hold the rings in the jaws while getting them in place was great. The price for the set was less than one pair on other websites, and I had them in less then a week. I was a bit concerned because of the price, but not the case, they are well worth it.PS: Hog rings recommended here were way to expensive with shipping. You can do better."
3,Complementary readings,"There are already many good reviews so I will only suggest reading the following books instead of, or in addition to, Barzun's idyosincratic book: 1) A Secular Age"" by Charles Taylor; 2) ""The mind and the market: capitalism in Western thought"" by Jerry Muller; 3) ""A Terrible Beauty: The People and Ideas That Shaped the Modern Mind - A History"" by Peter Watson; 4) ""The proper study of mankind"" by Isaiah Berlin; and 5) ""Nationalism. Five roads to Modernity"" by Liah Greenfeld."
5,A great book,This tome is massive but reads as if it were a series of short essays. Barzun was an wonderfully gifted writer.
3,"Not bad, limited.","This is a wonderful book to read, but you shouldn't rely on it. Barzun concentrates on the cultural (and other) legacy of the countries he knows best. These are America, France and Britain. There is a lot of Germany, some Italy and bits and pieces of the rest of the ""West"". Nevertheless, it's worth reading for its innumerable little revelations. Barzun is an old fashioned conservative, almost a reactionary, but a happy one and quite agreeable. The book will work well in combination with different sources and material. Good knowledge of history is imperative."
2,From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Culture,This book is for Ph.D. students and history professors only. Barzun's obtuse writing style and nearly obsessive attention to historical detail makes this a very difficult read. After reading this book I needed to read something by John Keegan to reassure myself that great history and great writing are not mutually exclusive.
1,too drawn out,Way to boring. Long and drawn out. Author needs to focus on more relevant details. A long read. Yawn.
2,History by a Frenchman,Can you believe it? The author rates the French Revolution well ahead of the American Revolution in importance!!
1,Absolutely BRUTAL!!,"This has to be one of the driest books I've ever bought!! I couldn't make it out of the first chapter without having to take a break. I thought I was buying a page-turning history of the past 500 years. Not quite. This book reminds me of something I was forced to read in a college history class years ago. If you are expecting something chronological (like, say ""1500-1550: What's happening in Europe""), you'll be sorry.Required reading for PhD candidates only!!"
1,Trash,"He dug up a vast amount of obscure facts and figures and passes on as a wise fellow. But he doesn't have a clue about the Western Civ and WHY it has declined. And he was a Chevalier, lol! Just like those Nobel laureats of literature and sciences? :)Revised Review:He dug up a vast amount of obscure facts and figures, but he doesn't have a clue what the Western Civ is. Obscurity doesn't depth(wisdom) make. It's penetrating insights, which he doesn't have. Barzun's book is like those profiles from The New Yorker: a lot of words, but not touching the truth. Another way to think of Barzun is that he is like a big puddle of water, very big, covering a lot of ground, but shallow. Extremely shallow.Yet another way to describe this book: the author made a portrait of someone, but you don't know what that person looks like! And he doesn't, either!Epic fail!"
1,A sleeping pill,I thought that the book would be a good read of Western civilization. I could not get past about page 20. I made at least four attempts to read on past that. Impossible. The book literally put me to sleep every time I tried to read it.
2,true but alienating and elitist-not the whole story,"traditional -yes,complete -no. western culture should be known as history.hitler was part of western culture. but to be held up as a perfect role model the status-quo is not a guide nor is western culture finished or complete. arrangements which damage people need to be changed and decadence(decay)is a symptom of this demand for change. barzun is defending his turf."
3,Not as good as he thinks he is,"Mr. Barzun, has on page 739 attempted to define novels as opposed to tales. He is neither an editor, nor as near as I can determine, a writer of novels. Most of his information about ""detective tales"" seems to be based on books written in the 1920s. Do not mistake anything he says as being helpful in the writing of a modern novel. Novels, like clothing, come and go in fashion as to their form and content. You may write what he calls a ""tale"", i.e., the relating of adventures that take for granted motives and settings, but if you pursue that course, you will look long and hard for someone to buy it. The modern reader is interested in motivations, and wants your characters to explain themselves to him/her. Actions and dialog without the subtext is boring, and does nothing to illuminate the human condition for the reader."
4,"Grand subject, disappointing writing","Mr. Barzun is one of America's grand intellectuals and original thinkers. I, therefore read his latest book, an ambitious project,to say the least, with much anticipation. While his approach is a refreshing departure from the relentless recounting of facts and events that characterize most history, I found his colloquial style distracting. Too, grammatical errors in the text left me with the impression that the manuscript had been published as dicated, without revision. After finishing it, I can only give this book 4 stars. It is brilliantly concieved, and magnificently executed, but in publication was separated from greatness by perhaps one more pass under the editor's pencil."
5,A Wonderful display of erudition.,"Jacques Barzun has amply displayed his encyclopedic knowledge with his latest work. The book is a compelling look at European history of the last 500 years. While the scope of the book is overwhelming, Barzun's narrative is engaging, entertaining, and beautifully written. Barzun, himself a distinguished academic, seems completely at ease with his material; the text, though exhaustively researched, is in no way pedantic. General readers and academics alike should find the text engrossing and compelling. While the book is not directed toward an academic audience, academics will still find within the pages of ""From Dawn to Decadence"" many passages that provide interesting perspectives on the last 500 years."
4,Does art lead or follow?,"Is art the result of cultural development, or does it lead culture? Is western society/art ascending or decaying? Is Minimalism a worthy descendant of the Renaissance, or an illegitimate spawn indicating/inviting corruption? Has the love of the new replaced love of excellence?This work skillfully explores the interaction of the arts with human development throughout a half-millennia. The author demonstrates a mastery of history, culture, and the arts in a narrative as fluid as Montaigne. The breadth of vision, novel insight, and disposition of contemporary sources make this a rare and remarkable work.Readers familiar with history and the arts 16-20C will appreciate this work, but beware:""Decadence was brought about by the easy way of producing works and laziness in doing it, by the surfeit of fine art and the love of the bizarre."" (-Voltaire, 1748)"
2,Miss the forest for the trees,"This book reads like a large compilation of short essays loosely bunched together thematically. Depending on your interests, some are interesting, some are not.Unfortunately, it is hard to keep track of the location and time period about which you are reading; and the sequence in which the book is presented is not logical or easy to follow."
1,voluminous minutiae,"I was overwhelmed by 877 pages in very small print of infinitesimal detail. This book may fascinate a scholar, but I look for a story that conveys the trajectory of history through important ideas. Covering five hundred years of cultural history requires focusing on pivotal events. Barzun presents a wide-angle portrait of the whole world where everything is in sharp focus."
2,The World's Gone to Hell in a Handbasket,"""From Dawn to Decadence"" says it all in the title. Western Civilization used to be great, and now people don't even dress well, don't respect elderly college professors (like the author), and blah, blah, blah. A view of the past five hundred years from the point of view of a crabby, old Frenchman. Like too many historians, his fatal error is in comparing the upper-class civilization of the past (which was enjoyed by maybe 2 percent of the population) with the popular culture of today. Guess what? He figures out that Beethoven is better than Eminem. Brilliant, what?"
3,Well written but ultimately fuzzy,"This is a LONG book. After you're finished with it, you still don't really know if you learned anything. I agree in particular with the other reviewers that the last section is a waste of time. But even the really good stuff (well written, entertaining for the moment) leaves you at a loss. There's nothing wrong with expressing some point of view, and Barzun should have added some more to this book, not less."
1,What a Disappointment,"I was so excited to read this book that I put it on my Christmas List. I couldn't wait to dive into it and glean the fascinating progression of western civilization. What a complete disappointment. The unbelievably disjointed quality of writing, constant back and forth between the past and today, and seemingly endless exposition of irrelevant facts made it impossible for me to follow the material. It took me about three minutes to read each page (a big investment for an 800 plus page book) and I still wasn't putting it together. I'm sure your IQ is much higher than mine, but I found this book to be pure torture."
4,Insightful anthology,"The author has an incredible grasp of the literary and art world, and how those narratives, shapes and likenesses were given birth out of their times and places in history."
3,Surpised That I liked The Book,"I am not usually one who would read historical tombs like this -- but was stretching out from my normal fiction genre. I do alot of travel to Europe, Mexico, & Central America and picked this up to see if it helped me better understand some of the different perspectives and issues that I experience when I go to places outside the USA. It certainly did that -- and it was a good read too -- not boring or collegial at all. The insights were very meaningful and connected some dots for me. My biggest criticism is that it is so long, and that it overlaps and repeats themes and actions, but from several perspectives."
1,This Book Was a Struggle!!,"I have owned this book for over a year and have struggled to get through it, despite my best efforts. Even on the sea days of a long cruise last summer, I was unable to get interested in this plodding, tedious, and at times pompously-written tome. While I have the greatest respect for the author's encyclopedic knowledge, I found the narrative dull and uncaptivating. As bedside reading, this book worked wondered for its soporific effects -- far better than any prescription medication."
1,not for your average Joe,"Mr. Barzun is a mature writer with encyclopedic knowledge (and apparently, memory) who has set forth all that he knows and that you don't want to know about the last 500 years. This book is for college professors and pedants, not for the reader looking for an interesting well-written treatise on the history of the world, part II. The book does NOT, repeat NOT, exhibit a coherent theme as advertised, but merely displays Barzun's monumental knowledge resulting in huzzahs from the cognoscenti but crashing boredom for the average Joe."
1,IT SUCKS,"This game really is disapointing, it has bad graphics and it is boring, i did not play the Sega version. I played the Super Nintendo version of this game. This is all they had to review on. and this version would probably suck too."
4,Replaces collets,"It has performed well, though needs to be retightened during use. I use it on stone, I have to moderate the pressure."
2,Collet jammed.,"After installing chuck I was unable to remove the collet. To this day itremains frozen to the chuck despite my best efforts to remove it. Thepiece is so small it is extremely difficult to install without locking.I suppose I should have removed the collet before installing ontothe threaded end of the motor, but how are you to know?"
5,Makes life easier,This tool works perfectly. I saves having to change out collets depending on the size of your drill or tool. Works as described and I would recommend to anybody that has a dremel tool.
4,Excellent chuck for Dremel 8000 cordless,Dremel should really include one of these in the Dremel 8000 retail box. Far superior to the standard collet. Easy to install and grips bit shafts much better than the regular collet. Highly recommended!
5,Works Like a Charm!,"After reading some questionable reviews regarding this product, I have to say that I was really impressed at how wrong they were. This thing worked from the get go and fit all different size shanks and bits. I use it with a Black and Decker rotary tool with no issues at all. Even works with the Milescraft 1003 Flex Shaft that I purchased. Good product!"
5,So essential that it should be standard,Once I install a keyless chuck on a Dremel I never take it off. It's like a no-brainer.Buying it through Amazon saved me inestimable time.
4,Dremel Accessory,A handy accessory when working with different attachments for your Dremel Rotary tool. It allows for quicker change of attachments.
4,"Awesome time-saver, but not for use with other attachments","I rarely use the standard collet that comes with the tool any more, after buying this item. No more looking for a wrench (which I invariably loose), etc. Beware, though: I took for granted that it would be compatible with my chainsaw charpening attachment. It is not. If you use other attachments, don't expect to be able to use this at the same time. If you don't use other attachments...well...go on to the next review. Well worth the buy, in my opinion"
3,Convenient but comes loose,"Personally, I think it's a bit on the price side, but the real disappointment comes after repeated use. Especially on uses where there is side loading or any chatter, but chuck quickly loosens up. There have been many applications where no matter how hard I tighten the chuck, the bit comes loose after literally 10 seconds or less. In these cases, I have given up and used the collet. I have two of these, and the problem seems to get worse over time making the product proportionally more expensive due to its short lifespan."
1,Cheap Chuck,"This is the second Dremel chuck I purched from Amazon. The first one lasted a little while before it seazed up & stopped working.So I figure one more try, this one only lasted two jobs before it stopped working. Cheap junk! I expect more out of Dremel & Amazon.Very unhappy about this product, I wouldn't order one if I were you.Dremel 4486 MultiPro Keyless Chuck"
3,Handy but...,VERY handy but look closely at how the chuck works. It can become stuck on the Dremel. I would buy it again.
3,Too Small for serious model work,"I bought this item thinking that it would solve my constant need to change collets. It may do that, but does not handle common size drill bit above 1/8"" dia. Sometimes you just need a little different size. If I could find a drill chuck with and 1/8"" shank that would allow larger drills, I'd be a lot happier. Anyone knows of an adapter, please let me know."
3,doesn't tighten very well,"this makes changing between different sized tools easier but often comes loose and the bit spins out, which can be a hassle/."
5,Nice Addition,I bought a used dremel tool at a yard sale and it had a chuck that uses collets. I ordered this chuck and I think it is 90 percent better than the collet route.
4,Keyles Chuck,"While not absolutely necessary to use your dremel tool, it is very handy if you ever need to run a drill bit or even a small screw! I'm glad I got it."
4,a real time saver,"I have at least six dremels in constant use in my metal restoration shop. Using them to grind cut, smooth, polish and drill among other things.The collet system makes me nuts, so I use the chuck. It isn't perfect, and comes loose a lot, so I keep a pair of plyers handy so I can crank down on whatever tool I am using As long as the tight plyers are around, the chuck makes the dremel far more usable."
1,Wobbles Like Crazy,"I bought this product thinking it seemed like a great idea, which it would be if it operated properly. It wobbles terribly at low speeds, so much so that I refuse to keep it on my tool because I am afraid it will be damaged with continued use. Other reviewers mentioned this problem, and I agree with them completely. It simply does not hold the accessories straight, and it is therefore useless to me. Not recommended at all."
2,Won't fit on a flexshaft attachment,I haven't used this accessory because it can not be used with the flexable shaft. Didn't think of that when I ordered it.
2,Dremel MultiPro Keyless Chuck,I don't know I like this idea about this thing that you don't have to use any tools to thing this thing. I tried to use on my router table and this doesn't holds strong enough. A lot of times I try to tight this really hard and still will not hold. I would not recommend this if you use a lot of routing bits.
2,Broke Almost Immediately,"As the title suggests, it broke almost immediately; the inner bit of the chuck frequently gets jammed, and requires several minutes of fiddling with needle-nose plyers to get it back in operation. Overall, I think it's saved me time, but it's still a pain and should be fixed."
5,CHUCK,"I was looking at buying the drill bits for my Black and Decker RTX B. AMazon showed that this was purchased along side the bits, so out of not wanting to wait i took a chance and YES i needed it. It cost way more at walmart so i bought it and it fits my drill perfect and my bits fit perfectly. Shipping was short and fast. Thank you."
2,NOT HAPPY,NEVER USED THE KEYLESS CHUCK IT JAMED AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK . TRIED TO OPEN THE CHUCK ONLY DAMAGED IT TO A POINT OF NO RETURN
5,Perfect,"If you have dremel, you must have this tool too.. Really usefull thing.. You can use any diameter drill on it. (Of course small drills used on dremel)."
4,Good,Good tool for what it does. Much quicker and easier then the standard chuck. If you change tools on your Dremel... this is a must have.
4,replacement dremel multipro chuck,ordered as replacement for the chuck that came with my dremel. The original one broke
1,Complete ly useless since it is the same gage as factory standart,It is useless. If you think it will accept larger diamtere bits -It will not. So why this is made is unclear since it accepts exactly the same bits as standard that comes with a unit.
1,product did not fit rotary tool purchased.,"Product did not fit the rotary product purchased,returning it proves to be a real problem.Dremel Australia did not want to hear about it as it was purchased out of Australia."
1,It was broken,Very bad experience. I ordered this part with dremel. I had Keyless Chuck and did not recieved dremmel. Don't want bay on Amazon ..........
4,Don't know where I'd be without it.,"I love this chuck. I've owned it for about 15 years, and it is such a time-saver! The only thing I can find wrong with it is that, over time, it can occasionally loosen up while using your Dremel. I've remedied that by using a wrench to tighten it, but over time you end up stripping the grips. After 15 years' use, however, it's probably just time to get a new one. It's terrific to have a greater range in tool use because of this piece, though, and I'll never go back to having to switch out those little internal chuck-adjustment pieces again."
4,Quick and easy bit changes,I've only used this a few times but it was nice not having to find the little wrench to loosen the bits. So far so good.
2,not too good,"I have not found this item very good for its supposed use. I have tried to use it a couple times already, and each time the bit I had in it would come loose and start slipping around. Perhaps if the bits were flat on the edges to hold them better. But this chuck is not work the money. I would not recommend or buy again."
2,"Concept is great, but it loosens quickly","I really like the idea of being able to quickly change bits, but they do not stay tightened long. I returned this item and might order another one to see if this one was defective, but based on other reviews, it looks like I am not the only one having this problem."
4,Saved by the chuck,Only one thing that is a con..the diameter of the chuck...with a nickle size cutting wheel you will run out of room if the item being cut overhangs the wheel and contacts the chuck. Other than that it holds great and no slippage.
3,Workbook,This is a comprehensive book including exercises to work on your PTSD. It is not an easy book to work through. It takes a lot of self examination and deep moral digging to complete.
5,Very good resource,Again I would recomend this seller to all of my friends and colleauges. Manuel sent promptly and in excellent condition.
1,PTSD Workbook,The authors of this book assume that you can solve post traumatic problems by filling out forms. This assumption is rediculous.
3,It's okay . . .,"This workbook is useful for creating handouts and generating ideas. However, it is inadequate as a treatment program in and of itself. That being said, I doubt the author meant it to be used in that manner. Overall, if you work with patients struggling with trauma, this will make a useful addition to your library."
3,"Probably useful, but not for me","I purchased this workbook on the advice of my VA Vet Center psychologist. Unfortunately, my particular form of PTSD is not seated in actual combat experience. As I started using the workbook, I found that most exercises were based on dealing with combat-related experiences. Therefore, I cannot speak to the actual efficacy of this particular workbook for combat-related PTSD."
1,not good,"This book is designed for personnel with only one type of disorder as a military veteran i found it difficult to pin down the problems and break them down into the subsections of this book. I also took the test at the end and mailed it to the ""Doctor"" for evaluation and its been a few months with no answer. If your not gong to respond please dont give me a tast which you are going to evaluate!!!!!"
2,not for professionals,This text is really elementary and for those just starting self help along with professional help. I thought it was a guide for professionals along with that---just as an FYI.Too elementary and most of the workbook exercises are a re-hash of old techniques; nothing in it I found useful or original. Sorry.
4,Helpful & Practical,"I bought this book because I was looking for a workbook for use with a client. It was extremely useful, with both psychoeducation as well as tasks, surveys and activities. I'd recommend it for anyone working with (or struggling with) PTSD when used in conjunction with therapy."
1,Maybe for the young or clueless?,"I ordered this book because it claims to cover C-PTSD, the form I have. However, all the author has done is take questionnaires applicable to the single-trauma type of PTSD and assume they are pertinent to C-PTSD people. They aren't. That is, they ask you about single traumatic events, but these questions are unanswerable for C-PTSD because the traumas are varied and often continuous and no single answer applies. I ended up believing the author actually has little or no experience or education with C-PTSD and is not qualified to write about it. This makes me angry because it is dishonest.In general I agree with the other one-star reviews. An absolutely clueless or young and inexperienced person may learn something by filling out questionnaires, but if you are a mature, intelligent adult I suspect you will feel like you are in grade school again.I sent the book back."
2,Not for military IMO,"This is a general purpose PTSD workbook. Seems more appropriate for survivors of natural disasters, rape, abuse etc. I wish there was more activities/guided work for veterans. I was actually searching for something to help a solider that has returned and is experiencing symptoms. This was not quite what I wanted."
3,Not as good as the rest of the Well World Saga,"I read the reviews before I bought and figured that the negatives were ""I miss Nathan Brazil"". I was wrong.The only character I grew to like had her mind wiped pretty much right away, so I didn't really care about her later.The plot was so convoluted and confusing, and by the end the threat so unclear, that by the end of the second book I hardly cared who won.You know, if you read this Jack, I cared about Renard, Nicki, Wu Julie, Asam, Marquoz, Serge Ortega, Gypsy and Prof. Zinder, every one of them more than I cared about any of these characters. What made the previous books great was caring about the characters.Also, the underwater people were just wet land people. They thought and acted like they were just land people trying to dom the things that land people do with the ""problem"" of all that water being in the way. A water people would LIKE being in the water, and their entire culture would reflect that."
5,Another round of gratutious violence!,"The Store is another fine example of great horror fiction! It is riddle with turns and twists that you can't possibly forsee. The plot goes around a Wal-Mart type store that comes into a small town and kind of takes it over in very weird ways. If you have ever lived in a small town (or currently do), you can understand this book. This is definately worth a read. Also check out his other books. The Association is along these same lines."
1,If Michael Moore wrote schlock fiction novels.,"Wow, this one's bad.I pushed past 220 pages of liberal preaching before the horror started, only to discover that there wasn't going to be much horror.Nothing much happens: The Store lowers it's prices below the local businesses, threatens it's employees, and occasionally kills someone, mostly off scene so that you're not sure what exactly happened. Although there's not much action, the protagonist gets plenty of space to complain about everything from organized religion, to the environment, to the shallowness of his kids' music - page after page after page of that.If you have to keep reading Bentley Little, skip The Store and read The Resort instead. At least it's a horror novel."
5,Amazing story. Great fun.,"I began this book as a student in high school almost ten years ago. I got bored with it after page 50, and it ended up in my basement until last month. I finally read the book. And I discovered that the first fifty boring pages were totally worth it, seeing as how the rest of the story is absolutely amazing. My jaw dropped a multitude of times while reading this book, and I have to admit I was on the edge of my seat, never wanting to put the book down. I recommend it. :)"
5,One of the Best Horror Stories I Have Ever Read,"I love to read but hate to write. I will say this book captivated me from cover to cover. What a concept! Take ordinary people and situations and turn them into something unbelievably evil! Reminds me of a few of my other favorite authors.I don't want to ramble on about what I got out of the story as so many others have. If you're a fan of horror, read it! Then decide for yourself. If you enjoyed it, he's got lots of other great books for you to read. If you didn't like it, don't read his books. Simple huh? After all, isn't that what reading is all about?"
2,Total rubbish,"I just finished this book and although I found the concept of it intriguing and scary, the book as a whole was laughable rather than frightening. As if a store could take a newborn baby from her mother in the hospital because they missed a couple of payments on their microwave! Where was the President of the United States, police forces in other counties/states, the media? I enjoy suspense and horror novels but only if they're in the realm of reality, which this whole book was not."
4,Wow!,"I loved this book! It's a very ""too close to the truth"" for comfort tale. I'll never look at Walmart the same. lol"
4,Thrillride,"I have just finished ""The Store"", my first foray into the world of Bentley Little, and found it an extremely engaging tale. Anyone who is from a small town understands the hold that the only large store has over you. Everyone has to shop there, work there....there's no getting away from it. ""The Store"" seems to add a bit more to life than the customers are looking for! Anyone who is a fan of a quick read horror novel should enjoy this one!"
3,Creepy,"I read this book a while back and was generally impressed by it. Actually, I believe it was the first book of Bently Little's that I read.Knowing firsthand how isolated some of these Arizona towns can be, I can believe that a store can become such a focal point of things in a town. And while I joke around that one day everything is going to be owned by a single company, ""The Store"" takes that to a frightening extreme.I agree with one of the earlier reviewers that certain things, like the origin of the Store's owner, don't get explained. However, I don't think that those elements prevent this from being a good read.I just wish that some of his other books, like ""The Town"" and ""The Association,"" were as good."
2,HORRIBLE ENDING,"I gave this book 2 stars because it had a great opening, and for the most part it kept me interested. Other than that though this is not a good book. As the story goes along it becomes more and more far fetched. It is more laughable than disturbing. The biggest problem though is the author has several bizarre story arcs he goes off on and he never resolves any of them. The ending made me wonder how this got published. I think the author could not figure out how to explain all the bizarre incidents that take place in the book so he just wrapped things up in a simple uninspired ending that left me annoyed.This book is not worth your time. This was my first Bentley Little book, and I must say I am very unimpressed."
4,Great beginning but a letdown in the end...,"I got hooked when I started reading this book. He writes very well and it goes fast. I recommend this book simply for the uniqueness and fun. However, I thought the ending was rather disappointing, and I was left with so many unanswered questions."
1,Disappointing work from a talented writer,"I picked up a copy of THE STORE after having read some superb short stories by Mr. Little, hoping to find more of the originality and literary command he had previously displayed. I was sorely disappointed. The book is a stifling mess. There is nothing here to interest any discerning fan of horror. I hope his next efforts are up to the levels of talent and craft he has previously shown. This book is, quite simply, dull."
3,Good book with a disappointing political agenda,"The store is a good read, at least for about the first half, then Little begins to push his anti-capitalist agenda--a little too obvious for my taste. I guess if I wanted politics, I wouldn't be reading horror. The characters are well developed, but too much is revealed in the quick ending."
1,absolutely third-rate drivel,"When an author receives such undiluted praise and wins book awards, I am naturally interested; in this case, my interest was short-lived: after 40 or so pages, it became clear to me that the author writes on a third-grade level. It's embarrasing actually. So why the hype: I suspect that there may be some political correctness lurking somewhere here. Intelligent readers - save your money."
2,Unbelievable & Rediculous,"This book was so boring. I kept reading, waiting for something to happen. What did happen was not believable and most of the time, stupid. I was disappointed in the story. Little's book have a common thread running through them and this one just hit a snag. Big book, little content, less imagination. Don't waste your time unless you just want to be able to say you've read all his books."
4,"Well written, but a little too much contrast","This is the second Little I read, and I have a good feeling about this book. As mentioned in another review, I also expected a ""Needful Things"", however at a larger scale. But's it is something different.What I liked so much is difference in ambience between scenes which takes place outside the Store (very ordinary), and those who take place inside the Store (very creepy).For example you just ""feel"" that new employees won't be in that easy. And indeed, they have to pass some initiation-tests from the sadistic Mr. Lamb.Although it is an original and unsettling story, I found the last part a little disappointing. From the point where Bill takes his stand against the Store, the story gets way too weird and unrealistic according to the first parts.Finally, there are some strange things and a big missing link. An 18 year old manager?? What are the Nightmanagers?A recommendation!"
4,another great bentley book!,"This was one of those books that starts out a little slow at first. Eventually the book does pick up the pace, and once it does; you can't put it down. The twist of mind control by chain stores, is thought provoking; considering how popular real chain stores are. This is a must read, for any fan of horror/fiction!!!"
3,Typical Bentley Little Fare,"This one's pretty good. Kind of reminds you of the businesses that manage to put smaller companies out of business, only this involves the supernatural. The Store has everything, even illegal items. And it spreads its evil through a chain of Stores. However, this is a Bentley Little novel, which makes it predictable. Every Bentley Little novel, usually about halfway through, turns into chaos. Everybody goes mad, killing each other, having wild sex, and causing trouble in general. No matter the plot, that's how it ends."
4,Creepy!,I really enjoyed reading this book. The story line was original and fast paced. I read this book several months ago and I still sometimes get a sinking feeling when I go to Wal-Mart! I'm no prude but I think some of the sex scenes could have been toned down a little although I guess they were somewhat relevent to the story. All in all an exciting read!
4,Twin Peaks meets The X-Files... A GREAT READ!,"The reader from Nevada needs to understand that this is FICTION. In Bentley's world, anything can happen! If you accept the premise of a wealthy chain of stores slowly taking over the country (even though it's slowly happening now...Microsoft, hint hint) you'll love it. Graphic scenes, fast paced action, and characters you CARE ABOUT make this a must for horror fans. Not terribly scary, but sooooo much fun!"
5,"Rubbish ,complete unadulterated trash .","Not in the league of King . Very shallow , bad English writin"
1,Bad. So bad. And not in that good meaning of bad. Just bad.,"From the very beginning, I was astonished at how bad this book is. It was not believable (I refrain from using 'unbelievable' so no one gets confused). I just couldn't finish it. I tried, I really did, but by the time a young mother was punished by the store for not paying the payments on her microwave, I'd had enough. It was bad. It was so bad. I can't emphasize that enough.A quick note: just repeating that something is creepy, does not make that something scary. I've read many excellent horror novels, such as 'It' and 'The Shining', and this was just bad.If you must read it, be sure your book store has a return policy before you buy it."
1,makes a good sleep aid,"This book is terrible. I read The Walking and I found it entertaining, if a little simplistic. This book, however, is ridiculous. The plot is threadbare. The ending is ludicrous. Perhaps it would make for an entertaining read if I was 14 years old. Surprising to see incest used as a plot device in such an offhand manner. I recommend not wasting your time."
2,It was alright,I have to admit I wanted to read this book to learn more about female circumcision. I wondered what could possibly be going through a person's mind to even come up with such a barbaric tradition. Do these men really prefer going to bed with women that feel nothing but pain from them. Are they so afraid of a women's sexuality that they have to rip it from her. And what kind of brain washing does it take to get these women to go along with this. Etc. None of the questions that would come to mind when talking about this issue were answered. 95% of this book dealt with the US legal system and how they treat imagrants applying for assylum. I was really disappointed and had a hard time finishing this book.
5,SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IT,IS A SAME FOR ALL THE AMERICAN CITIZEN THEN THINK THEY HAVE A DEMOCRATIC AND A FREE HUMAN COUNTRY AND THEY SHOULD SEE THROW THIS HAPPENINGS WHAT RULES YOU PEOPLE HAVE. REALLY PITYFULL.
3,Not what i expected,The description said brand new but when I got the book the front and back covers had marks on them
5,Sad,I read this book a long time ago but it has always remained with me. Deep sad story but worth the read because she survives.
4,Works for me!,"I received my shoes very quickly and they are very comfortable. I have been wearing New Balance walkers for several years and they have all have a good fit on first wearing them with no ""break-in"" necessary. These particular shoes were a bit more expensive than I usually buy them for and no more comfortable than the shoes selling in the $50.00 range so I gave them 4 stars."
4,Decent little reel - can't hold too much line - small reel - backpacking size -fresh water only,"This reel is smaller than I thought. It is best used on small lakes and or rivers for trout or smaller fish. The drag in the back works fine but is the cheapest part of the real (plastic). The reel work really well however, though it does not hold a ton of line, but enough to launch a bobber out there. The handle has a screw on the reverse side the allows it to be collapsed when loosed- for travel... I found that after about 50 casts this hand tightened screw can loose a few twist- Overall a great little inexpensive reel, for beginner to modest- Caught more than a few 10-12 inchers on this guy, and it will last more than just this season- Highly recommended for the price if you application is for the under 20"" -type of fish- it has an overall smooth and quite action to it"
3,ET,This game is alright-nothing more. All you do is go throught different locations collecting bottle caps and trading cards in order to exchange for parts with other kids. With your parts you can then create your communicator which lets ET phone home.
3,Rather fun.....,"This game was fun on the first level, the City. However, on Level 2, the Forest, it became rather bad. The animals that are in various levels after the City are unavoidable! If you get near an animal it kills you! It should not be bought( I've had the thing over a year and still ain't beat it)."
1,Too dim,This light is very dim. An average flashlight is brighter. Better off using a flashlight than using this light. Not recommended.
3,American Tack 73012 Round Cordless Utility Lights - not very powerful,"Purchased 2 American Tack 73012 Round Cordless Utility Lights. Lights are easy to install and the pull cord is very convenient, but they do not give off much light at all. I have them in a shed and the light they give off is only visible if it is completely dark in the shed. They did arrive quickly and were well packaged."
1,very cheaply made!,the 2 d cells you must use makes the device about 8 times heavier. bump the light while hanging or turning off or on and you may dislodge a battery or even the bulb. i've tried others and finally put in a socket with a pull chain and ran a/c to it.
5,EXELLENT FIRST PERSON SHOOTER,"wow, this game is amazing, i noticed that a few people have given it a bad rating. i, presonally dissagree with them. maybe you should tone down the blood and gore (it gets a little disturbing)but i guess that's all for the better, right? I think it's a very good game and it is also a good party game because of the multiplayer. The graphics are mind-blowing and i was smply blown awa by the gameplay. if you are a fan of first person shooters i would definetly buy this game (weak-stomached beware of the location damage) those of you who don't know what location damage is it's like if you shoot in the leg wit a shotgun, his leg gets injured and/or blown off, so its like a location on your body gets damaged, get it?"
4,the most gore game shooter on psx2,a great fps game the graphics are not that bad i had the dreamcast version and it was too dark now for psx2 is my best fps game lot of blood gore with the shotgun i gave it 4 stars because i did not like the music is just heavy metal rock but you can take out the music on options so dont worry this game will amaze you .
2,A bit too much hype over this game....,"Let me start by saying I have not played the PC version so I cannot compare the two. However, SOF for PS2 is...well...simply put, really dull. If you have played many first-person shooters, much of the game play will have a been-there-done-that quality, except not as good!The choices available in weapons are uninspired and the enemies are nothing special.Worse yet are the graphics. They are far below what the PS2 is capable of. There is little detail to textures and many objects look too simple. In fact, I have seen better graphics on some PS1 games!Text for the mission briefings is so small, you will need an enormous television to read it without going blind. Unfortunately, this is a port of a PC game that looks like a port of a PC game. Disappointing since so much better is possible (the PS2 version of Half-Life, for example)."
2,It Stinks,"It's graphic violance is about all this game has going for it. The graphics are poor, the scenary doesn't change much, and you get bored fast. This is diffenetly down at the lower end of combat games on the market for PS2."
1,Eh yucky...,I won't go into reviewing this game very long so I'll make it short. This games graphics suck! I have scene better graphics then this and this is from the PC I mean c'mon! The graphics are terrible compared to the PC.I hated how bad the frame rate was and everything about the graphics were really really bad.The violence in this game are hardcore but the pc Version is better mainly cause of the graphics.I'm so glad I returned this I just couldn't handle the bad controls and graphics. I mean I donno I just did NOT like the game compared to the PC version which is better.In short...Get the pc version1 out 5Lates
1,this is the worst dam game i ever played,"This is the worst dam game i have ever played on any system at all. It has worse visuals than a freakin Atari game. THe game takes place in Iraq and Russia, but the Iraqis speak Russian. The game is so unrealistic that you blow up a a nuke on a train, and run along the top of it as it's exploding. I could go on but I choose not to because that is not possible for there is so much wrong with this game to name it all would take forever."
2,Not that good,I'll sum it up for you.PC game is great.Ps2 version isn't. Buy the PC game if you want this game
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Please spend your money on another game. The regular game play is too fast and jumpy. However the multiplayer, which is very popular these days, is awful. Even during a 2 player match the game slows down and lags, I cannot imagine what playing with 4 players is like."
3,Update,"Started out as an outstanding product. Just like any electrical applicance, you must plug it in and unplug it correctly. Soft orange glow that is just enough light for late night trips to the bathroom. Not a harsh green or blue. Highly recommended.Update: One really does need to be careful when unplugging these so they don't come apart. After approximately 2000 hours of use two of the lights began flickering, and then failed."
1,Dangerous,When I attempted to remove one of these from an outlet the top just popped right off. The area was dimly lit and I almost did not notice that beneath the cap is unshielded/exposed AC wiring.Recommend caution when removing or placing in areas with children.
1,you call this a case?!?!,"I have purchased several styles of cases for several different iPod models over the years. This particular one is a thin, flimsy, cheaply made vinyl case with a zipper that is nearly impossible to close without ripping it apart. It will protect the iPod from scratches, but not from moisture or being dropped. My Otter Box cases do this, but none is available for the Gen 3 iPod. Don't bother with this case. Get a generic one at Target and deal with the access to control button issues as best you can."
5,awesome soap!,Awesome soap! I love the different scents. I have bought Fernwood before and I will certainly be a return customer. If you never tried this soap you are missing out on a wonderful scented bath/shower experience. My sister-in-law bought me my first set as a Christmas gift 2 years ago. I am glad she did.
4,fine details,"Was very pleased. Very good details on all characters (fang and norbert as well as hagrid). Well worth the extra few $'s to get this larger one, some of the smaller versions of the whole potter clan are not worth it- pay attention to height!"
4,Not bad at all!,"I used this fragrance some 25 years ago and I wanted to retry it. Just like then I would say ""not bad"". Matter of taste...The lotion itself is of good quality, it quenches a very dry skin and best of all it does come from Italy!"
1,"driver software doesn't work well, support is pathetic","I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now. The main problem that I have is the driver software crashes, usually at least once per day. I reported the problem to Lexmark support and they claim that it is not a known issue. But when I search the web, I find that others are having the same problem (the driver puts a Lexmark ""red diamond"" in your system tray - when the software crashes, this red diamond turns into a ""red X"" and a reboot is required before the computer can print again). Also, the scanner/copier doesn't do too well with narrow items. I used to be able to make photocopies of checks for example, with my HP. Making photocopies of anything small is very difficult with the Lexmark x125."
2,How hard is it to feed paper,"I've had my Lexmark X125 for almost a year now. I'm now shopping for an HP. At least once every 50-100 sheets, the paper feed mechanizm goofs and I have to open up the printer and pull out scrunched paper. And the lines of text on all pages are slightly slanted due to the paper pulling mechanism being on the paper's left side.The fax/copy feeder slot tries to feed as many sheets at the same time as it can. So to fax or copy a multi page document, I have to feed the sheets one at a time. What a pain.Ok, one more complaint. This printer, when it grabs a new sheet of paper makes a startling loud noise that makes some people jump.Pick another printer."
1,Requires too many ink cartridges,"5 out of 10 print jobs are slanted, maybe because it grabs the paper so hard. I've invested a small fortune in ink cartridges alone. Never have seen a machine similar to this one require so many ink cartridges as this one does. When the message displays ""change ink cartridge"" you can't get anything else to work, so you're forced to buy more. I'll count my losses and buy a better machine."
3,"Why Microsizer, why?","Microsizers are the US liscensed version of Tomy's Bit Char-G. Tomy offers faster motors, and Microsizer at least offers a 2.6 motor. Why is itthat Microsizer has decided to only include a 2.2 motor with the hop up kit? That's no faster than the one included with the MS Pro, and not very fast, for my taste.The tires are some kind of hard vinyl, and offer no traction on most surfaces. I consider that a downgrade more than a hop up. Some sticky tires would have been nicer.The teal gear and sway bars are useful for tuning, but the 2.2 motor hardly has the torque to pull the teal gears off the line, and it takes alot longer to wind up.Overall there's nothing here that makes it worth the price, which is a shame, because Microsizers are excellent cars, with a large internet cult following. It's really too bad they killed their advancement into the mainstream with a flawed marketing strategy that limits the potential of the car to the common user."
4,Make sure it fits your needs,"I thought this kit would be really beneficial. Well, I guess I didn't do my homework, but its still a worthy purchase. I got this for my black Skyline Pro to upgrade it. Well, I didn't notice that it includes a 2.2 motor, which is the same as the one that came with the vehicle. However, the new axle is the best available, the Power Gear. So much low end torque, it's hard to grip the floor. Which is fine for me cause I mostly just do spins and skids with my Microsizer, so I like it better this way, but not everyone will I'd guess. The suspension upgrade is another perk. This is actually quite cool as it give you more stability while turning (and seemingly less pull to one side) The tires are nice too and give you better traction on hardwood. But again, you'll need to analyse what your looking for.A highly recommended upgrade if you have less than a 2.2 motor, otherwise do some cost analysis."
2,Not durable,"I really like the regular Fantom vacuums so I decided to buy this handheld to see if worked any better than my Dirtdevil. It actually worked better but it broke after 4 months. Completely dead. I called Fantom and asked what the return policy is and it was only good for 90 days. Therefore, I'm still using my Dirtdevil."
2,How do you clean this thing?,"I just bought this vacuum and it worked very well. It's very lightweight and powerful and it picked up a lot.But here's my problem - I've only used it once and I can't figure out how to open the filter! I removed the filter from the dust cup, but I can't get the filter to open. It's pretty full but I should be able to open it, right? Can anyone help me? If I can't get this thing open, the vacuum will be useless soon."
1,Looks good in person and on paper but that's about it,"I bought this thinking it would be great for my upholstered furniture since it has a brush head and a HEPA filter. I have 3 cats at home and this vacuum doesn't do ANYTHING. It's loud - that's about it. Sounds good and looks good, but a waste of money. You can get better cleaning results using a tooth brush on your furniture."
1,The Worst Book Ever Written on Shakespeare,"It's well known in academic circles that after Oxford University Press published this in Europe (which must have gotten a few people fired) they refused to release it here. It's full of major errors, and is riddled with ""gentle Will,"" ""sweet Will,"" ""immortal Bard"" rhetoric that is utter nonsense. The book is blatantly homophobic, sexist, and fetishizes Shakespeare to an embarassing extent; I used it in a ""Shakespeare on Film"" seminar with university undergrads for a daily exercise in comic relief. Complete rubbish."
3,If only the strap were longer...,"The pad is a good size. Some pads I have tried are too long, and when you use them on a chair that has some curvature around your sides (and many chairs do), the pad ends up wrapping around you and pressing in on your kidneys. But not this pad! Many pads are much thicker than this one, which is good on flat back chairs, but if your chair already has a little lumbar support, those pads can be too much (and keep your head too far away from the headrest in a vehicle, which is dangerous). But this pad is not too thick! However, the strap on the back is WAY too short. I could not get it around my rather small truck seat, so I had to cut it and manually add an extension of my own.7/7/09 Update - I just got the following half-roll lumbar support, and I would recommend it instead:http://www.amazon.com/Duro-Med-Lumbar-Back-Support-Half-Roll/dp/B000HLZ96C/ref=cm_cr-mr-title"
5,A Necessary and Approachable Book,"McGraw is a breath of fresh air at a time when theology continues to attempt to escape the world of (brain) matter and postulate Being with little regard for the phenomenal world of which we are a part. While it is understood that our knowledge of the brain's functions is limited, McGraw's book brings us a few steps closer to understanding the presence of awareness in the cosmos and simultaneously opens us up to questions about our beliefs that we may not have thought to ask. Brain & Belief is a hearty dose of demystification."
5,Thoughtful and wide-ranging,"Having always been a reader of philosophy and psychology, I found this book an excellent conjunction of the two. The first section on the history of the soul awoke me to some of the history behind this important idea. The second and third parts which serve to induct the reader into present ideas surrounding the soul and the consequences of accepting or rejecting the basic idea of the immortal soul always kept me challenged--though I very much enjoyed the writing throughout. Highly recommended for people with a philosophical interests."
1,gee.. another teleologist..,"In various places of the book the author jumps to conclusion and entertains baised hypotheses. The author also lacks the thorough understanding of the involved issues. He pretty much never seriously presents the problems of the concept of soul, and thorough evidences and analyses against it (e.g., I would expect a comprehensive analysis of split-brain patients, phantom limbs, etc). The whole book is pretty much about beating a strawman that the author builds. Any of Ramachandran, Damasio, Flanagan, Ledoux, Wegner, Pinker, Dennett, Edelman, to name a few, would give much better information that this author. The book itself is very disappointing in this particular subject. I would not recommend anyone to waste money on it unless one wants to endorse another teleologist's ideal for serving for the unfulfilled goals and defending the useless moats."
2,Interesting...but not that great,"I wouldn't normally have reviewed this book, but since the only review for it was 5 stars, I felt I needed to offer a balanced opinion. The book starts off great then drags on for the last two-thirds. The author does a great job of weaving in the history of the Dirty War in Argentina and the difficulty that followed during the transition to democracy. She also artfully shows the interesting conflict of opinions of those who ignored or even supported the actions of the Argentine military and the rationale of the ""subversives."" In the case of the storyline, the truth is better than the fiction. All of the really interesting parts actually happened and the story the author chose to tell around those could have been better. An ok read, but definitely not a 5 star book."
5,riveting,This goes on my list of one of the best books I've ever read. The storytelling style was perfect. The characters were amazing; each one a significant part of the history of the disappeared to be told.
4,Worth keeping,"I was full of excitement when this book came out and immediately ordered one. The major focus of the book is on Manhattan and important places like Statue of Liberty and airports where they're shown at a larger scale than residential neighborhoods.1. Not so important areas are shown at about 1/5 the scale in comparison to the scale shown for Manhattan.2. Another disappointing fact is that these images are almost seamlessly patch together with computers. Because of this, the different perspective views of two images patched next to each other made me dizzy and uneasy looking at it closely.3. Larger scale print outs of any one area are available for purchase, but they cost more than the book itself.4. Overall, although somewhat disappointing it is nonetheless a great book to have and keep as a photo record of New York from above."
4,Heavy Chevy,"My collection wouldn't be complete without a Chevy hot rod engine. This baby looks so clean, man, I can hear those pipes roarin' now."
5,"""The More And More I see This Man......""","Yes. I saw the movie as a newly trained doctor in Madurai, a city in Tamilnadu, South India. I even remember the theatre - Regal Talkies. (It used to double-up as the Victoria Edward Hall Public Library during the day time).The punch line in the film is ""The more I see this man Jacobowsky, the less I like him"" - uttered very often by Kurt Jurgens.Jurgens suspects that Danny Kaye is hanky pankying with his beautiful wife.Near the end, they are cornered by the Nazis Gestapo. Jurgens goes into a shock and is unable to speak. Danny does the talking and explains everything deftly.Finally they escape.But Jurgens thinks that they have left behind a secret document.But Danny produces it from within his neck scarf.And Jurgens smiles and says, ""The more and more I see this man Jacobowsky, the more I like him"".That was the last scene."
1,Grave disappointment,"This is one of my all-time favorite films. I sent it as a gift to a close friend. This DVD was listed (properly) as non-USA format, an obstacle that any decent DBA manager could bypass. It was NOT clearly indicated that it was in SPANISH and therefore totally useless even if the foreign security codes were eliminated. It will be returned ... hopefully for a full refund as it was shipped by an outside agency in Voorhees, NJ, not from Amazon ... another glitch that was not disclosed and caused a significant delay in shipment.Barton"
2,too much for the shipping & handling charge,"i ordered 4 plates, each cost $0.99 but they charged shipping & handling separately on each item for about $20! I don't understand why they have charge per item since they're in the same pacakge (box). the item price is good, i guess they just want to make money back from the S&H fee..."
5,Great Old School Wrestling Game For The Genesis,"This game brings back so many great memories to me.This was the first Genesis game I ever owned.It's so much fun to play.It will take you back to the good ole days of the WWF...Thats for sure.So many cool old school wrestlers.Everyone from Hulk Hogan...to Macho Man(RIP)...to Brett Hart to Shawn Michaels.Even some wrestlers I forgot all about..like The Model,Papa Shango and Crush.It's great! Pick this up if you own a Sega Genesis,and if you loved wrestling back in the day when it was still good.Five stars!"
5,Fantastic even for a 3rd-time nurser ...,As a third-time nursing mom I found this book to be invaluable. Its format was logical and easy to use. The research was more extensive than any other book I have read on nursing. It answered pressing questions immediately and fully. Finally I enjoyed its humor and the light approach to common challenges! Jean Kirshner
4,A helpful reference,"Most breastfeeding moms would benefit from this book, and as someone with a strong instinct to breastfeed, but supply issues, I found it helpful for the most part. As a quick reference it was pretty good - most of the FAQ'were answered. I'm glad to have it."
3,"pawn you palm pilot and let ET hook you up, holmes","I'm not sure how this thing really works, but my homies keep paging the 2 way on my GBA whenever I have this game on. Anyway, so far, I have sent my resume on my GBA with this game and gotten the job; I have stored all my girlz phone numbers, and even sent a message to my momz. This is a cool game, but wait til Gary Condit: The Man The Myth drops on GBA late summer. The graphics are a little questionable, but hey, who in the world could get Condit's hairstyle to translate well on such a small screen. Anyway, as Condit, you are trying to get elected for the 6th term, but some PR issues stand in your way. The FBI is only a step behind you, and your funds are running out...what do you do? Just say no, Condit. I like the secret code that hooks you up with Monica Lewinsky. Good luck Gary"
4,Who knows what evil lurked in the hearts of......,"This is a fun outing in this series by Collins. As always, he has done his homework and put together a believeable and intriguing story about Orson Welles, John Houseman and Walter Gibson. They were tied together through The Shadow stories from pulp novels and radio plays. In its own way the story is much like the War of the Worlds radio play Welles was famous for. To say more would be to say too much. Sit down and enjoy this quick read."
3,A nice gift,"This was a great gift for our 11 year old son who loves basketball.The only trouble we experienced was that we had to use a hammer to assemble one of Shaq's legs because the parts didn't quite fit properly, and the little peg that sticks the basketball to Shaq's finger was missing.Other than that, they're fine. The likeness to the athletes is very realistic."
5,Collectors and fans,"I have a few of these figures since I stumbled across one for real cheap. I mainly buy the players on my teams but when you can get two probable Hall of famers in one, you can't pass it up. I suggest these figures if you have a safe place to keep them...they are not for little ones to play with...mainly to look at and ""remember when?""."
2,too small,"I have 2 older versions of the same model of bra, and the new ones are MUCH smaller, seems like a B cup instead of a D cup (but the tags verify the model and size). I was very disappointed since the old ones were my absolute favorite bras (comfortable, supportive and no lines under clingy shirts)."
1,Band Size is off.,"This bra is well constructed, but the band size seems to run very, very small. It was no different from the Vanity Fair 34 already in my drawer. Was disappointed and returned."
5,Excellent Item!,I originally purchased this bra at Kohl's for $40 and wished I had purchased more. I was delighted to purchase this for half the price and still get the same quality product! Thanks.
3,bra review.,I love this bra... It seems to run smaller than the same bra from a few years back. Wish I could have gotten a bigger cup--stops at DD--so I am spilling over. The old DD still fits fine?
2,bad choice for me.,"The bra is very nice but underwires were to severe and it was fully padded. I guess I didn't read carefully enough but I would not have ordered a padded bra...I took the underwires out, could not return since I foolishly washed them before I wore them..I take the blame for not liking them..."
3,not as expected,"I didn't realize that this had underwire in it. I don't recall anything in the description stating this fact. I thought it was the same style I had bought in a local store, which was more comfortable.I didn't send it back, but I won't purchase another online."
5,"Comfy, straps don't slip off shoulders","I've got 3 duplicates of this bra. The best feature is the straps don't slip off my shoulders, like other bras do. I've got a lot of space between 'the girls,' yet this bra lies flat in the center part of my chest. It's comfortable throughout the day, and the wire does not hurt at all."
5,Great bra!,Best style bra I have every tried. Especially good for shorter women with large breasts. The adjustable straps stay put instead of slipping like many other bras.
1,preachy,"This is preachy lame book filled with boring paragrasphs that are supposed to be profound. There is no continuity to this book. The man probably would scribble down thoughts on various things. An intellectual exercise. Bor-ing. I don't need a self apppointed guru explaining life to me. My impression is the guy is on an ego trip. He thinks he's some kind of master. He's not. Most pages are a third blank, then one of his pseudo spiritual bon mots. No feeling to this book.Someone told him he should write a book, and he believed them. I don't even consider these unrelated ramblings to be a book. I would have given it zero stars if I could. I'm not in the greatest mood at the moment, thus no sugarcoating."
3,"Not very refined, but OK if you can forgive its shortcomings","This game is nowhere near the level of polish seen in HOTD2 or Confidential Mission. The story makes no sense, the graphics are decidely first-generation DC, many of the sound affects are downright laughable, and the localization is horrible. However, since light gun games aren't exactly epic tapestries of plot, this game is pretty fun if you can ignore its faults. There are several different kinds of enemies, some average, some actually pretty cool. At six stages, it's about twice as long as CM, and much more challenging, since enemies usually require more than one hit to die. You definetly need a gun to play this game right, because control on the controller is far from refined. So if your itching to use you light gun on something new, check this out. But whatever you do, just don't pay full price for it!"
3,Death Crimson OX,Its pretty much what you'd expect from a light gun game on Dreamcast. I bought it merely for collection purposes.
1,This game...,"If you think you will like this game because someone told you it was good, then your wrong. I have a lot of games and this one is the worst. It is impossible to get a minute into the game without dieing. I hate it. It isn't fun and has bad graphocs. Don't waste your money or time."
2,Doesn't seem to be very durable,"I had this racquet, as did a friend of mine I play with. Both of our racquets ended up with cracked and misshapen frames after eight-ish months. To be fair it's my first racquet so I don't have much to compare it to, but I expected it to last longer than that. This time around I'm going to try a different brand / model."
5,Bought for a friend.,The after innocence was just what my friend wanted. It arrived amazingly fast and I delivered it to him the next day. He was a very happy camper!
5,After Innocence,This is an amazing story of the mistreatment of many Americans throughout the Criminal Justice system. It is an excellent educational tool as well as an emotional film about injustice in America.Any Criminal Justice Student and/or Professor should invest in a copy of this movie lest we forget....
5,Just like that a life is changed,"A well Done Documentary.A standing ovation goes out to the staffers of The American Innocence Project and to those who were open enough to share their lives with the public. The amount of years that these individuals spent in our US Justice System is horrifying. Their stories are a reminder that this can happen to anybody in the USA.As a viewer, I was hopeful that these individuals were able to go on with their life to the best of their abilities.There is information noted in the DVD for individuals who want to help."
5,Hard Action 3pk - Hitman / Street Kings / Man on Fire,"Can't go wrong with any of these movies.Hitman - Thought this movie was great. Olga was just to die for literally. lolStreet Kings - If you've never been to L.A. go see this movie. It'll give you an idea of how things are. Great movie.Man on Fire - Amazing, brilliant and vengeful."
1,Not worth it for anyone over 15 yr old,"these movies are less than a year old if these movies were any good they would not have to package them together to make it look like you are getting a dealman on fire is the best of the 3 denzel washington is good in a suspenseful thriller. it is the once decent movie they threw in to try to sell the other 2 dudshitman is based on a videogame that is never a good start for a movie. if you like senseless mind numbing plotless movies then by all means have at it.street kings is keanu ""made of wood"" reeves how this guy still has a big time movie career is baffling. he shows no emotions what so ever. this is another thin plotted movie you will watch once and it will stay on your dvd shelves forever."
2,This radio has the worst reception of all the radios,"Pros: The radio looks nice and expensive.Cons: The reception is so poor, that my $15 Radio Shack radio picks up better. This will be the last time I purchase a cheap Chinese knock off."
1,This product is a waste of money!!!,"This radio only can tune in stations via an old-school tuning knob, making it a MAJOR pain to go from one station to another!!! It has NO preset capability!!! And what ""genius"" decided to NOT include a power cord??? I would've had to shell out $25 extra at Radio Shack just to be able to plug this freakin' thing in!!! You're better off getting this model:Sangean PT-80 AM/FM Professional Digital Stereo LW/SW Shortwave World Band Travel RadioIt has preset capablity, auto tuning, an included power cord, and an optional antenna to improve shortwave reception. You'll get more bang for you buck when you get this model."
1,Pictures can be deceiving,"Received two cactus pods (not looking healthy) without roots, a small bag of dirt, and a plastic pot without any directions. A far cry from what the picture looks like."
5,New E.T. games are great!!!!,"Ok, although I dont have this E.T. yet, I fully intend on buying it the day I can. The gameboy advance game is great! Its more of an adventure game than this title is, but the graphics are nice, and E.T.'s animations are hilarious! NewKidCo is doing a fantastic job on all the kids games recently, and I see no reason why this will stop. Check out Tom and Jerry, or the Muppets games too. Video games that teach something other than violence, keep it up!"
2,died in a day,"I was using it with a compact fluorescent bulb, so only one of the on settings worked without flickering, but otherwise the item worked just as specified. However, it died within the first day, so maybe it was a defective unit or maybe it can't be used with compact fluorescents."
1,Poor Instructions,"I would not even give this product one star if I had that choice. The instructions with this product are very POOR. I followed them but when I pugged the lamp in, the dimmer 'popped' and smoke flew. Fortunately the circuit breaker went off and there were no other issues with the dimmer. I totally disconnected it, threw it in the trash and rewired the lamp. It no longer dims, but at least we have light.Save your money, go to Lowes or Home Depot and get one with good instructions."
1,Not delivered as stated.,"Product description states that item comes with wire nuts and instillation instructions. Not so. Item was stuffed in an envelop wrapped in an invoice and that about it. Not even sure if item is new, as was stated, or has been removed from something else.Had to go on an on-line scavenger hunt to find a wiring diagram.Prouduct might be ok but seller needs a little work."
4,works well,Works as promised. A quick 5 minute install and the lamp is working again. The only thing is that they should warn in bolder print that you cannot use a CFL bulb. I was warned by another reviewer and it saved me from blowing the circuit!
5,SRV - BOX SET,"This is a great box set for SRV fans and people who are new to SRV music. This is what all box sets should be, the set has three CDs and one 30 min DVD of SRV & Double Trouble on Austin City Limits.The music on the CD starts with SRV first recording with Paul Ray & The Cobras to his final concert at Alpine Valley. The CD has rare live performances of songs that were never released on an album, solo guitar by SRV and studio out-takes.The DVD has an un-aired performance of SRV & Double Trouble on PBS's Austin City Limits, the DVD itself is worth the price of the box set. Stevie and the band were in great form!There are essays and quotations from other Blues such as B.B. King and Eric Clapton, and there a lots of great pictures in a great package."
3,Some solid stuff and some not so solid stuff.,"I consider myself a huge SRV fan. I have all of releases (including the re-released studio cd's that have 4 or 5 new stuff on them. When I saw this box set, I knew I had to have it. It starts off with some tunes from his early years and ends with some of his last live performaces. It includes 3 Cds and 1 DVD (I don't have a dvd player so I will have to wait until I get one to rate what I'm sure is an awesome DVD). The third disk is by far the best. He is clean and sober at this time and does some of his best live stuff here. My favorites on are disk one (cover of manic depression) and every cut from disk 3. If you are looking for a box set that encompasses SVR's entire song library, than don't buy this. If you want never before released SVR to add to your collection, than you can't pass this up. I rate it a 7 on a scale from 1-10 but real SVR fans don't care how it rates; they just want it."
5,Amazing,"A piece of his amazing work, nice booklet with plenty of other artists reviews. Almost cried with his brother quote."
5,A Great Slice!,This box set gives the listener an ideal cross-section of Master SRV's depth and breadth. It's a fine representation of his career and genre.
5,95% COMPLETE,"The long awaited Stevie Ray Vaughan box set comes out with plenty of unreleased gems which is what most of us fans look for since the majority already own the previous albums. However, there's one obvious omission - Lou Ann Barton. She was influential in Stevie's early part of his career and at least one song from her bootleg sounding ""Thunderbroad/Sugar Coated Love"" should have been included. S.R.V. was of course too talented of a guitar player to continue as a side musician and moved on. Most of the music recorded during that period was meant to stay in the vaults. However, when it comes to a box set, I like to see a close to complete history lesson on disc if possible."
1,"Good Lamp, Poor Mount","The stove clamp is made from very soft plastic, and there is a toothed swivel wheel that you can move around and clamp to get the correct angle for the lamp. However the plastic is so soft that the teeth quickly srip, and then you can't aim the lamp. I also cannot really see how the lamp mounts to the side shelves of the stove as shown in the pictures, I tried and the mount will not clamp to the edge. The way the mount is built it looks like will only work on round rod handles. The led light looks good, but there is a real problem with the stove mount. Back it goes."
1,Flimsy construction,I purchased based on Cook's review. The flexible arm broke upon initial attempt at attaching to grill. I'm returning. It's not worth the money.
2,Camp Chef Camping LED Light with Stove Attachment,"I would not recommend this product. The light given off from this fixture is not that usable. Very small beam and the amount of light makes it hard to see the whole grill. I like the mounting and the flexible arm but this just isn't usable. I went to Home Depot and bought a 9.00 combination LED flashlight, with a magnetic base, and I light up the whole grill and have much better color rendering. I do not recommend this product, too expensive and not that usable."
1,Poor quality construction,"The mounting hardware (the stuff that clamps it to the BBQ) is weak. Way too flexible because it's made of soft plastic. Moves all around, and tends to slide off the BBQ. Compared to the no name I bought from Costco 5 years ago, it is vastly inferior. Would not recommend.Update!!! This already lousy unit broke last weekend while I was bending the gooseneck to put the cover on - Just cracked off in my hand at the base. Absolute crap!!!"
5,Very nice,"I went to Wal-mart and bought a random power strip, and while it works, it has a short cord, only 5 slots, and doesn't have any kind of protection indication or grooves in the back so that it can be hung from a wall. These, on the other hand, are better in every way. They have a long cord, six slots, a protection indicator light, and have a pattern in their base that would allow for them to be mounted to a wall.I never really compared the features of power strips before, but for the (as of the time of me writing this at least) low price, these are a great value for the money."
5,I think it works,I hooked this up to a flat screen TV and a ROKU box about a week ago. Last night we had a lightning strike about 300 yards from the house. It destroyed a tree but my TV and ROKU box are working just fine. I don't know if the surge protector saved the equipment or I was just lucky but I feel better with the surge protector hooked up.
5,tripp litt are high quality,".I think Tripp Lite is a high quality brand. Their products seem well made and they have been in the power electronics business for many decades.I got this for $8.20 delivered. Considering the way Amazon abuses its warehouse employees with low pay and intense work, I would happily have paid an extra dollar if that meant those workers could triple their pay."
5,Gtreat Value For A Decent Surge Protector,"These surge protector strips offer a great value for the money. They offer decent protection, backed by a warranty and a decent company. You never really now how good a surge protector is, until it gets hit with a major power surge. If all goes well, the surge protector should either be able to absorb the power surge and/or be destroyed in the process; but your connected equipment shouldn't be harmed. If by chance it does, then the manufacturer's warrnty should cover any damages. Either way, time will tell and I'll update and edit my post as needed. But these seem like a great value for most people, offering decent protection and a company that stands behind their product."
1,Complete junk,The switch broke off taking it out of the box. Needless to say it won't work. Do not buy from this manufacturer.
3,Cheap,But effective strip to get it done. Nothing fancy but you sometimes get what you pay for. Just don't use for pricey items.
5,"Works, no issues",Does the job as advertised. I think Tripp lite (making strips for decades now) is one of the better companies for helping you if equipment attached to your surge protector fails. Other companies make you jump through hoops to take advantage of the protection value warranty. I recommend this to anyone looking for a simple surge protecting strip.
4,Good power strip,"My needs were specific: a solid power strip, six outlets, a cord that was 4 to 6 feet long. This one met the criteria.The case is solid. The two pairs of mounting screws are far enough apart that it will mount reliably. I don't like this form of mounting, preferring tabs you can screw down for a solid mount, but none have that these days, sigh.Four stars, I like it, because it does exactly what it should.I reserve five stars (""I love it"") for products that are excellent, that go above an beyond in some way. If this product included two to four USB charging outlets, for example, for no more than $5 additional cost, I would give it five stars. I haven't seen one yet, but I bet we will very soon. UPDATE: found one, and ordered it:Belkin Surge Protector 8 Outlet With USB. This would not have fit for the project I needed, but I have a different use for this one."
5,Highly recommend.,"January 1, 2010 I had a power surge in my house that fried my computer. After some research into the problem, I found out that the Philip's surge bar I was using never tripped and the surge went straight through it into my computer. (Dealing with Philips was the biggest load of bull ever and they never refunded me for my computer.)I did a lot of research on surge protectors after that and I have replaced all my surge bars with this one. I have yet to have a power surge while I have had these installed, but from other reviews of people who have Tripp-Lite seems to be really easy to work with and they back up their products. Which after dealing with Philips, is very, very important."
2,Comprehensive but dated,"This book covers all areas of the state of California, and could be very useful in comparing and selecting between the eleven areas of the state that the authors profile. The book covers many cities and towns, but does miss some towns that could be of high interest to retirees -- such as Auburn and Morro Bay. Unfortunately, since the books was copyright in 1998 and because of the rapid increases in real estate values, the home prices given are quite out of date."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I started reading yesterday and could not put it down. It is so interesting to have a look at the Civil War through the eyes of those that lived it, and Saunders' historical notes are facsinating. It amazes me to think that those letters were waiting for her to find and bring back out to the light of day. I am eagerly looking forward to being able to read more later today!"
1,You Can Do Better...,"My husband bought this vacuum for me over a year ago. It worked perfectly for the first two months or so. Since then, I only use it once a month for fear that it will explode. There is a horrible low-pitched noise coming from it whenever we turn it on. Customer service suggested that we buy a new one. I would NOT recommend that you buy this thing."
2,I found a belt at sears,My belt broke also and i bought a sears brand replacement belt for a kenmore vac. It is belt number 5287 for upright vacs. You will have to pull a little to fit it on but it works just like new. You get two belts for $4 and some change. You can buy it from sears.com also.
2,"Good story, bad book","This is a reasonably entertaining story in the genre of fighting sail. The problem is in the production of the book itself. Here's yet another example of a book which seems to have had no proofreading whatsoever. Typos abound, and on occasion words are simply used incorrectly.Here's an example from page 134:""Here, here,"" they all said in unison as they drained their glasses.That mistake is made consistently throughout the book. The fourth lieutenant's name is usually spelled Witzenfeld, but occasionally it becomes Witzenfield. Bungles like these bring the reader up short and sadly interrupt what is otherwise a good seafaring tale."
4,A new source for sea stories,"I opened ""The Reaper"" with enthusiasm, and I was not disappointed with the story. Michael Aye gives the reader plenty of action and a different viewpoint on the Revolutionary War. I would, however, like to see him flesh out his characters more and present more details of life aboard ships, as well as action in battle. It was almost as if he wanted to get through the story quickly so he could get on with the next. But I DID like the book!One other thing. The publisher evidently proofed the book with no more than a spell check program. I encountered several words misused, and punctuation was frequently incorrrect. Hire a person who's familiar with correct English grammar, folks!"
2,Potential Unfulfilled,"The book has the potential to be a pretty good novel. But it looks like a first draft, or maybe notes for a novel. I think the story line is pretty good, but the author needs to introduce his characters, give them some depth, and show (not simply tell about) their relationships. The characters need to make the hard decisions, but too often the author gives them an easy out. Descriptions should be evocative. Language, grammar, word usage, and paragraphing need to be drastically revised.I hope the author will learn from the O'Brien, C.S. Forrester, and Alexander Kent series, revise, and publish more interesting work."
5,He's Done It Again...,"Opening this book you will find yourself transported to the Caribbean, on board the Drakkar. I can see Anthony standing strong and tall, leading his men into battle with the prirates. Anthony finds himself faced with responsibilities including his command, his dying father and now the future of a half brother. I find myself cheering for Anthony as he rises to the challenge. This is a great read. I know you will agree."
2,The Reaper,"The plot and charaters are very indtersting, but NO MEAT to the story. Book is too short and needs more detail. What is the day like, what are the chacaters thoughts and ideas. This book would make a good magazine short story published over two or three issues. I would not bother to purchase another book by this author."
2,Trite and Simplistic,"If you have read O'Brian, Stockwyn or Kent, you know good writing and will not enjoy this book."
1,bad,not happy game as supposed to be new but was not what else do you want me to say this game sucks
1,ABYSMALLY PAINFUL AND HORRIBLE 3 OUT OF 10,"THIS GOLFING GAME SUCKS SO BAD IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY HOW BAD IT IS. The basic mechanics don't even work properly, and will only piss you off because of how improperly balanced the controls are. For example: when hitting the ball you will notice how the ball always seems to get carried to an area far away from the area you intended it to go. You don't want to know how many times it will take you to get the ball even close to the hole. You will get stuck trying to get your golf ball out of sand traps and so many other places you will be left extremely pissed and agitated at this game. It's really not worth anyone's purchase unless you enjoy crappy sports games, go buy modern sports games instead, because most of the old ones like this one suck extremely bad. Don't buy it, whatever you do, because it's Hell's golf game."
5,The Textbook on Marina,This the the definitve textbook on Marinas. The 2nd Edition is full of information and is a must read for any marina designer.Marinadesigner.com is the source for muck of the information.
2,Stick to Greenspan's Own Words,"This was absolute nonsense. I think the plan was to mimic Greenspan's speeches as Fed Chairman. Reading Greenspan's testimony before Congress would have been more entertaining and would give the reader respect for his ability to chose his words carefully most of the time. This was a hard-won ability as evidenced by his few notorious mistakes (remember ""irrational exuberence""?). It was also an ability that was necessitated by the fact that the world listened to and believed what this man said. There aren't many people like that in the world."
5,Excellent program; easy to follow instructions.,"This book contains the essential elements of an easy-to-follow how-to book. The authors explain the why, what and how clearly; and the use of pictures is most helpful. The authors are highly credible (orthopedic surgeons and physical therapists). I am 50 years old and a 16 handicapper who plays three or four times a month. The last 3 or 4 years, I had been experiencing lower back pain while playing and I had lost some distance from my game (ie - drives were traveling 210-220 rather than 240-250). A physical therapist started me on this books regimine five months ago. So far, the results are improved flexibility, better strength, no more back pain and some improved distance in shot length. The daily routine takes 30 minutes or less. I will continue to follow its program and look forward to more improvement."
2,"OK book, needs an update","Not a bad book, just a little outdated from some of the information and training techniques the trainers use at my athletic club. Doesn't show enough stomach work in my estimation or work with common weight machines."
1,"Poor organization, ok information, lack of programs","As a serious golfer, I want to change my exercise routine for golf. These were already exercises I was doing with a trainer as well as in other books. I specifically wannted more on aerobic training, nutrition and how to train before golf season and during(seems to be my biggest problem). I want to know why and when, this didn't do it. Might only be $10, but if I got to see the book first, I wouldn't have gotten it. I want it all spelled out with some justification, this wasn't the ticket."
1,"Incomplete, I want more!!!","I exercise regularly, wanted to make my program more golf-specific. I wanted much more information on aerobic training and weight training, especially specific programs before the golf season. This wasn't it."
2,"Great research, lousy exercises","The research presented is interesting and suggests that the exercises would be effective. Instead, it is just more of the same old stuff. I can't see how this program is likely to help a golfer."
1,Not even good basic fitness book,"Golf is a complicated game, and this just doesn't cover it. I found no rationale for wanting to exercise for golf from this book, so it is good I am alread doing something!!"
1,"Good idea, weak and lacking treatment",You are better off getting a good general fitness book than this
1,gear guide 12V ceramic auto heater,"I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who expects to keep warm with it. for all intents and purposes it will just take up space. the heat from it is EXTREMELY WEAK you literally have to keep it in your lap to feel anything and as a defroster if you dont mind holding it up to the window as you drive down the road then it will be mildly useable, but if you drive a manual transmission then forget about this heater. all in all this item is a total waste of money. it does produce heat but nowhere near what you need even in a 2 seater pickup truck."
1,cita sin anestesia ............... Lisa Cach,I did not receive the book ........... I am still waiting for it
3,Wrong size indicated,"This is definitely a pocket New Testament. It measures only 5-3/4"" x 3-7/8"" NOT the 6"" x 5.8"" as advertised. Consequently, the font size is too small for comfortable reading and too small for my old eyes to read in dim light. I won't return it because Bibles make great gifts."
1,"No good, Fuji I thought U guys had great tech","I'm trying to see how good my photography skills are and then I got this item as a starter, it's been less than a year and it can no longer take photos, also all the pictures that I took with this camera have turned out awful. I got tips on how to make the best of your pictures,even took a class in photography and still it's bad, I wish I could get a refund for my money, but if U know how I can send me an email ASAP. I don't use the camera anymore and I'm outraged at the waste of money, not to mention the fact that I'm a fulltime student (well known fact have little or no income)."
2,Hard to remove,"I have had this filter for over a year. It works as advertised. I have taken beautiful photos with that classic polarized sky and lush green vegetation. But, and it's a big BUT, it is nearly impossible to remove from my Canon 28-135 lens. There is no knurling that allows your fingers to grip the threaded frame that screws into the lens barrel. In fact, it fell apart while taking it out. I had to put it back together (an adventure in itself). The lubricant that is used for the rotating mechanism ended up on the glass and now it is unusable. I would recommend against this filter for that reason alone."
5,Revolutionary!,"The most subversive thing that Famous Builder does is to retell family history from a queer perspective. Thus, the young narrator&#65533;s painstaking journey toward an adult queer life is implicitly compared and connected to the father&#65533;s movement up the social ladder. From Paul Lisicky&#65533;s point of view, both are quintessentially American acts. How refreshing to read a book in which gay identity is not THE subject of the story but one of its narratives. Every reader will find an aspect of her story mirrored here, regardless of her background. I&#65533;ve come back to it again and again, always with something new to ponder."
4,Charming,"A charming, heartwarming little book that demonstrates the great love and appreciation that Pope Benedict XVI has for the life and works of Pope John Paul II. The book is supplemented with wonderful and iconic images of Pope John Paul II that include some photos of his various visits around the world."
1,Supposed to be a new book...HA!,"I love the book, ordered new, got used with black ink underlines throughout the book. I have been trying for two months to exchange it, no luck yet!"
2,Poor plot,"The plot of this book is just too unbelievable. Either this guy is the worst FBI agent in the history of the FBI or I don't know what. The ""heroine"" is shallow and just plain idiotic. I thought the story dragged out and I found myself skipping pages."
1,Did not work in brass lamp,"I bought this for a brass desk lamp and it did not function at all. The lamp socket is metal and there was contact with the dimmer's contacts but it never responded to a touch on any part of the lamp. I tried it in another lamp and it worked a few times but was not consistent. The brass desk lamp has a dial switch on the cord, perhaps that was the problem. The light would sometimes light dimly when I turned the dial switch, but never completely power on.Will try a wall connected touch switch next."
1,Forget it,"Did not go all the way into the socket, and did not work as advertized. A call to the MFG resulted in no return calls. This unit was to replace an older model that plugged into the wall. I suggest they go back to that model. We have two of the old style, one of which died, and newer model was supposed to replace it. If you look at the base, their are two wires that are supposed to make contact, however if you have a paper inside, that will not allow it to work."
1,Sent back,did not work at all. tried on 2 different lamps and did not work as described.Sent back the day received.
2,not so great,I guess it is common sense but I didn't think about the part that this screws into must be metal. Most lamps are plastic now so you have to watch where you are going to put it. Another thing it changes brightness if someone walks by it. We have tried correcting this based on the directions but nothing has worked...its a little annoying.
5,Buying more!,"I highly recommend this product. It is wonderful for my Mom, for whom it is no longer easy to turn a lamp switch, and it will solve an annoying problem switch for me, since I'm tired of having to adjust the shade on a lamp I have with a hard-to-reach switch. Installs as easy as a light bulb, works like a charm - touch any metal on the lamp, and it turns on or off. Great!"
1,Will probably not work in most lamps...,"Like one of the previous reviewers said, this product will probably not work in most lamps. In older lamps, the entire metallic housing that the bulb screws into is exposed, allowing the two contacts (protected by the two tabs) to contact.However, with most (if not all) newer lamps, the metallic housing sits inside another housing, usually made of plastic or ceramic. So when you screw this product in, the two plastic tabs hit the plastic/ceramic housing on the lamp and prevents the two contacts from contacting your lamp's metallic housing.It's a little bit difficult to explain, but trust me, once you buy this and find out it doesn't work, it's easy to see why."
5,Love it!! For lamps with METAL bases only!,"I recently had a bedroom remodel, and the new lamps were HUGE, and I would literally have to get out of bed to turn off the lamp. I bought this after some good reviews, and I'm glad I did. Now all I have to do is reach over and touch any metal part of the lamp to turn it off/on. I loved it so much, I just bought another one. It is very important that you have metal on the lamp, or it won't work."
2,Product turns bulb on without touching lamp,"The title of this tells it all. I turn off the lamp with touch faature, and within a few minutes, the light bulb turns on again by itself, and stays on. Very unreliable."
2,Save the Warranty Papers,These seem to work pretty well unless the bulb burns out. I don't think it is possible to replace the bulb and not ruin this dimmer. Save your warranty papers. Howsand@aol.com

3,Holy fools,Thank you. Service was prompt and accurate.There was an additional bonus of three children's paperback books.I've sent them on to my grandsons and eventually they can enjoy Holy Fools as well.
1,Failed by the authors own expectations,"White says he ""will measure the book's success by the extent to which is surprises its readers, catches them offguard, and forces them to think about new ways not merely about the Columbia but about nature and its relation to human beings and human history.""Well if this is his standard he failed miserably. The book is an absolute bore because it focuses so much on ancient history. White tries to bring in Native Americans and salmon as a way of bridging the gap between nature and humans - it does so, but it is painfully slow, dull and uninteresting. The book changes a little as it moves into more modern times, but his ending thesis would have been just as strong had he not tortured the reader with a 50 page history lesson.The last chapter also includes the term ""Organic Machine"" about a dozen too many times. We figured out from the title what the term meant, rampant repetition doesn't bring out his meaning any more."
5,Shootin' Envy,I bought this for my fiance who loves to go and shoot pool. He is the envy of all his friends. They all wanna know where he got it. I was really excited and impressed with me buying this for him. lol. Thanks
2,Not Straight,"There was a slight bend in the stick so when you make a play and youre following through, the cue veers off at an angle. Not great to make perfect shots."
2,Very cheap,I could have gotten a better stick for the price. Tip is very small and not even glued on. I wouldn't recommend the cue to anyone.
3,Good stick,The stick is really nice. My boyfriend loved it. Only problem is that the case it came in was broken.
5,Good poetry!,"Derek Day's poetry is well written. He has a true talent. What I love the most is the way he captures relationship experiences with such vivid emotion. For most of us, our feelings and beliefs about love go unspoken because we just cannot find the words. Derek has found the words in this book, and it is a pleasure to read. I recommend the book to one and all, but it will have special appeal for those involved in a romantic relationship. Last but not least, it has some for family and friends."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I just bought this from amazon and it is the cutest thing ever. That said, it's a really bad steam cleaner. Furious pumping of the handle yields minor wisps of steam. It fails to approach anywhere near the steaming power I thought I was buying. Have no fear grime, the steam penguin will never threaten you."
1,This item is a scam,"I only put one star in because it is a required field! Does not work, everything everyone has said about it is true, hardly any steam produces, too much hand action, it's like cranking an old car!!! I wish I had sent it back but it cost more to return it by UPS than it does to keep it."
1,product Stinks,"I am very dissapointmed with my Steam Penguin. It does not produce steam. It gets warm, but just sits there. The Ready Light never turns green, it is just always blue. Very cheap item. No wonder it is so cheap to buy. Definitely not worth it."
1,Worse than bad,I tried this item and it does not blow steam once in a while a trickle of water. Would not recommend this item.
1,DON'T BUY THIS...........,YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS JUNK. THIS DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR.
1,Does not perform as shown on tv,"I was given this product as a xmas present from my husband. I really just wanted to clean my pets cage. I'm not happy that you have to keep pumping the handle to get any steam! I really mean ""pumping""-but the instructions says ""don't not pump more than so many seconds, can break the unit"" (plastic unit), but the steam doesn't come out consistantly unless you keep pumping!.The steam is not powerful enough and that it's a plastic unit- you really can't get the performance to steam consistanly. Although the price is right -the performance is not, even on my stove and counter top- not enought power and to much usless pumping, just water no removal of grime.BNot recommended-"
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"December 31, 2003This doesn't work like it did on HSN.I had dreamed of the day that my Penguin would arrive, so that I could have a cleaner house for the new year. Unfortunatly, the Penguin did little to meet my expectations. The power needed to steam clean wasn't there. It cause more work and stress, by the constant need to pump and pump and pump, etc. My thumbs were sore, I was exhausted. Little cleaning was done. I had to use a degreaser plus other cleaners, along with the Penguin, along with a big wire scrub brush,to begin to see a breakthrough in my efforts to clean my oven. I am sending it back to HSN as soon as possible."
1,Might as well throw your $ in the trashcan,"Don't buy this product. It is a waste of time and energy. I recommend saving up and getting a ""vapor cleaner"" instead of a steam cleaner. They are expensive, but actually work.My mom bought this for me and I plugged it in and waited for at least 20 minutes. It never heated up and never produced steam. It was just a piece of junk that didn't work."
1,No action-pumping or not,This product has a vaccum leak and does not have any pressure. It worked breifly when I danced around with it just right. Major dissapointment.
1,no water tank caps,I HAVE PURCHASED 2 STEAM PENGUINS FROM EBAY AND NEITHER ONE HAS A WATER TANK CAP SO I CAN'T EVEN TRY THEM OUT. THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER OR CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER WITH THE INFORMATION OR ANY WAY TO CONTACT THE COMPANY ON THE INTERNET FOR PARTS. MADE IN CHINA IS ALL I HAVE TO GO ON. BUYER BEWARE RANDALL LOVAAS
1,Very disappointed,"I was so excited to get this! Looked great on TV. Got it home, nothing works right. You have to cross your fingers, dance a raindance, and circle the penguin to the left three times before it will put out a puff of steam. And my steam ready light was blue, not green."
1,What steam?,"I purchased a Steam Penguin at a local store. I returned it twice. I finally decided that none of them work. Three of them never made the slightest wisp of steam. The only steam was coming out my ears for wasting my time and money.Before returning the last one I dissected it. I discovered that the ""pump""... didn't. A design flaw that will prevent them all from working.Don't buy it! They don't work. Made in China, no surprise."
1,steam penguin sc610,I am not happy as it get warm but the pump does not work. Any advise. Help me how it can work.Till now I am not happy with this product
5,just as advertised !,"This is the original and it is everything we hoped it would be. It is a replacement for a lost ""favorite"""
4,"Great book, graphs are impossible to see",I love the book so far but how can you possibly see any of the graphs which so far are many. I have blown up my text to the largest size but I still can no see them. They apprear to have great info in them...
2,Some good ideas....some really bad ideas too,"I reccomend that you borrow this book before purchasing it. I have found only a couple useful ideas. Some of the ideas are just rediculous. For example...spraying your floor with shaving cream and letting your kids ""ice skate"" in socks on the kitchen floor."
3,"500+ ideas, not all of which are both fun and creative","This is an interesting book in that it has collected a large number of activities you can do with your kids. But of the 100 that I've read so far, probably only 30% are BOTH fun AND creative, and only 60% (including those that are both) are either one. Some activities are not too creative- like, ""go look at the stars and pick out constellations"". I mean, that's great, but what homeschooling families do not already do that? Others do not seem that fun: flash cards? That being said, I guess if you are totally new to homeschooling and have never been able to come up with a single thing other than watching television, you might find this book worth it. I wish I'd saved my money and done the research on the Internet."
4,Great Creative Ideas!,"This book has more activities in it than anyone could possibly do. It gives many ideas to choose from based on subject. The author states that she prefered not to organize it based on age, since children of a particular age could be at several different learning levels. While I understand this reasoning, it would have been helpful to me to have a cross-reference based on general age groups. All in all, if you are not very creative(like me), but want to offer your children a variety of activities, this is a great resource."
5,Awesome!,"This book is great! My son is only 4 but I am getting a head start on homeschooling him, this book has given me many of good idea's. I am seriously thinking of using this as my main curriculum for kindergarten, I'll throw in a couple of workbooks too, but this will help me plan most of my lessons. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
1,Disappointed AGAIN,This may be a terrific video...gosh knows the previews I saw were excellent...Too bad I can't watch it. Despite the Format saying US and Canada only...its in PAL (like THREE other DVD's I've ordered now) so I have a flat fly swatter I can use. This really ticks me OFF!!!!!!
5,Great Surge Protector,"I'm very happy with this item's performance and design. The main reason that I chose this one is that it has ten outlets. Considering the number of peripherals that need to be separately plugged in for a computer system these days, plus a few extra items with chargers that I like to plug in while I'm at the computer, having that many available slots is wonderful.I also like that they arranged the outlets intelligently, with gaps to permit the insertion of the larger plugs that some electronic devices require."
4,boo,"came on time, great gift idea, loved the product, wonderful service, nice to have around when you need good read"
5,A nice change to everyday children's books.,"Great artwork, fun story, Margie Palatini is a wonderful author and different. We have a lot of her books and love every one of them. Edgy, and not just a sweet bed time story."
1,Terribly disappointing,"We're HUGE fans of PIGGIE PIE, DING DONG, and THE WEB FILES, but this one just doesn't live up to the edginess we've come to expect from Palatini."
3,tax guide 2000,I WONDER THAT WHAT MORE DETAIL CONTENT THIS BOOK ( TAX GUIDE 2000). PLEASE LET ME KNOW I WAIT FOR YOUR ANSWER. THANK YOU. BYE.
2,Archaism Reigns.,"George Brandon Saul, October Sheaf (Prairie Press, 1951)The other Prairie Press book I scored on Box Day (q.v. review of Brief Inheritance, elsewhere this ish) was George Brandon Saul's October Sheaf, published right around the same time and with the same focus on formal poetry. Saul, however, is not as accomplished a poet as Smythe:""Out of this echo's hornWhat mountains melt awayTill gods immured beforeTime's night was drained from dayTake starry flight once more!...""(--""The Horn"")Now, I wasn't born in 1951, but I'd be willing to bet the man on the street would saw ""immured"" was as archaic a term then as it is now, and you'd have to go back to William Wycherly's time to find grammar as arthritic as those last two lines acceptable. Still, as an artifact of a time, it's as valuable as any other Prairie Press book, but while I can see myself returning to Smythe for the simple pleasure of reading it again, this one won't bet getting the same treatment. **"
1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD, IF YOU LIKE ORIGINAL ART","I should have known this CD was too good to be true. Had it contained songs from the original artists, it would have been. The classical selections (first 6 or so) are poorly recorded, and are only useful for getting an idea of what those musical pieces sound like.I was hoping I could use the Father/Daughter songs for our dance, but I am afraid I won't be able to. Their version of ""Butterfly Kisses"" is cheesy-sounding at best, nothing like the original. The other recordings sound extremely fake, and unless your wedding guests are too drunk on the wine, I am afraid it will be blaringly obvious to everybody.I'm going to stick with buying the original albums for most of the selections on this cd."
2,"Oh, please let this be fictional. . .","Agreeing to marry without even talking or meeting? I can imagine the never meeting part, but never talking? And exactly *how* is this Biblical? And how is this foundational to a lifelong, committed, godly marriage?And to be honest, I'm very skeptical of any book written by young marrieds about marriage--which they obviously are from their photos. They haven't had the years of the ups and downs and real trials that most marriages go through.While I don't doubt this couples commitment to each other, I am pretty confident that they will come to a point in which they look at each other and say, ""What was I thinking? This isn't what I signed up for? Who are you and who am I and why did we marry?""May they come to that place and grow through it, becoming closer, by God's grace.But honestly, advocating never talking before agreeing to marry is Biblical? Puh-leeze."
1,It's a cheap piece of foreign garbage.,"Here's a list of what's wrong with this item:<br />1. You'll stain your wrist trying to screw in the hex and other screws.<br />2. The wood is cheap and can split when screwing in screws.<br />3. The wood panel for the drawer was warped and didn't fit.<br />4. It's from J.P. Products - who doesn't provide customer service during listed business hours, nor do they have a web site.<br />Overall: avoid this product. It's a shame Target is willing to offer such an inferior item.<br />"
5,Wonderful!,"My preschool aged daughter always asks to ""hear Spanish"" and we listen to this cd almost every day in the car. She has picked up an amazing vocabulary. I promised her that when we learned every song on this cd, we would buy the next one. She's nearly there!Now that Susy has the matching book out, my daughter sits in the back seat with the book open to the appropriate page and follows along. This is a really great cd, the music is very catchy, and the best part is that I get to learn Spanish too!"
3,Just adding it to the collection,"I love Dover's CD ROM & Book series. In fact, I would classify myself as a junkie. I have every Egyptian-related release that Dover has ever published, and while the illustrations in the book are very striking and crisp, if you look at the TIF's on the enclosed CD ROM, they are extremely amateurish and sloppy. If you are thinking about using them for any sort of web or book project, then without a doubt you will be spending a great deal of time doing cleanup and colour re-adjustment in Photoshop, Paintshop Pro or another graphics editor. The colours of items, glyphs and fleshtones are not at all consistent to Ancient Egyptian artistic canon and grammar. Also, there is an almost excessive use of the colour orange within the geometric patterns as well. One gets the feeling you have seen the same pattern over and over again with very few variations on a theme."
3,Great & Bad Game,"This is a great game, but once you get to the end it is hard. One thing I really liked about it is it is so realistic. It is a lot like the movie. You should buy this game only if you are over 7 years old. Great overall game!"
3,ok game,"well i got this game. i was really excited. the game is alot of fun. well i have only got to the second level. when u get this game, in the instructions it says that u can have a password and type in the password to start from the level u ended with. but i dont understand where to type the password. so i dont play the game because i hate playing the same levels."
1,Too Violent,"My 7 year old daughter got this game for Christmas and it gave her nightmares. She gave it to me and told me she doesn't like it because it is so violent. ALl throught the game the cat is getting smashed over the head by a bat over and over and other acts of violence. This should not be for kids. It should not have an ""E"" rating. It just encourages and glorifies violence. We wouldn't have even opened it if we knew what was in the game."
4,OK,"This book is OK, I'm reading it after reading Stoned Free and I notice that it uses alot of things I've read in Stoned Free (published around 10 years earlier). I would definitely recommend this book for teenagers or even adults who want to get into a different state of mind without using any substances. This book, despite the cover (which I don't like), actually has good information with tons of different methods to get you where you need to be. As someone who has been interested in this subject for years I can say this book doesn't fall short of my expectations for a book on the subject and is actually quite informative. The content is great, the cover...not so much, but hey, it's worth it."
4,Fantastic older coming of age novel,"Set in Australia, this is the story of Rachel, a disarmingly honest and quirky 18-year-old girl who's just beginning college and her life on her own. She accepts a job as a live-in caregiver for a brain-damaged woman, and soon finds herself trying to balance her insatiable curiosity about the woman's life with her newfound responsibilities and freedoms. The charming story and a narrator I could relate to rendered me incapable of ever setting the book down."
4,Good refresher on a lost art,"Some people find writing cover letters difficult, especially if they haven't needed to look for work in a while. This book is a great refresher providing solid, grounded examples with good descriptions of do's and don't's.For people who are visual learners there are plenty of examples so the patterns of good letters begin to emerge from the specific examples allowing the reader to internalize the lessons.Given how little formal business correspondence is emphasized today this book will help the reader stand out from other job seekers and professionals. Well worth your time and money."
4,Perfect size,"Its size is perfect for the big stuff. If you have a grill this definitely is ""must have"" tool !!!"
5,Close-up Filter,The close-up filter is really great. The price was very reasonable and the delivery was quick. I will be doing business with them again.
1,Yea right,632 pontiac motor not happining buddy pro mods are only 610 cubic inch pontiac mountain motors and they run 7's in the 1/4 and lucky to break a high 6 and you say you guys have 632 cube crate motors thats 22 cubes more then a pro mod thats not happining that is a suicide bore your pistons would hit each other witch would mean no go no where buddy so I think so buddy
2,Monotony Monotony Monotony Monotony Monotony,"I've been A Trekker since the Kirk-Spock-McCoy age, and have always wished for a really great Trek game. THIS IS NOT IT. Don't be fooled, there's a lot of shooting the same critters over and over and over, the puzzles are elementary at best, and the whole experience is incredibly unsatisfying. Two much better shoot-em-up games (if you've got, and use, a brain) for PS2 are HALF-LIFE, and/or TIMESPLITTERS 2. Trust me, I know whereof I speak."
3,Play a little and wait a lot!,"A good game with great graphics and a reasonable story to boot, but come on! How can you make people wait for 3 minutes while the game reloads and loads in the next scene? It isn't on and just gets really irritating after a while....well, no! Straight away!!! You can go for a tea break AND a number 2 and still come back to find tha computer in the process of loading. And hell, does it get boring when you can't find which pile of boxes to jump on in which order to get to a control panel.Not impressed. Sorry, but I'm just not!"
4,"Great Graphics, but not very long",I just bought this game about a week ago and when I first put it in I was amazed at the graphics! I mean talk about detail!! But if your looking for a long game levels wise this probably isn't the game for you. I'm not a very experienced game player but I've already beat the whole game in about a week.
4,Better Than Most,"Have read a half dozen or so books that discuss the non-financial aspects of retirement. While not perfect, this one is by far the most comprehensive and well written one I've come across."
1,Fund your retirement by selling books about retirement,"Repetitive, derivative, impractical. There's nothing new in this book, and quite a bit that the author wrote in his book about living without a ""real"" job. There are plenty of books about how to plan financially for retirement, but this book ignores that issue so glaringly that all its other suggestions fall by the wayside."
4,"GOOD, nOT GREAT","This is one of the better books on retirement. It's presented in a light, informal manner which I enjoyed. It's also a fast read. And with retirement looming one doesn't always have time to pour over a lenthy, dry book.I'sd recommend this book for the semi savvy near retiree. If you're a complete beginning without a lot of knowledge about saving or nivesting this may not be oyur best bet.And for anyone interested in getting a better return and finsding financial security i recommend The Millionaire Mind.The Millionaire Mind"
4,Retire,"Easy to read and important info for anyone contemplating retirement at any age. We often overlook the ""non-monetary"" effects of retirement and this book does a good job of outlining those concerns. I bought several copies and gave them to friends who were retiring as ""retirement presents""."
5,Zelinski hits another one out of the park!,"Ernie Zelinski is one of my favorite authors, and one of the best in my opinion, in the ""finance"" and ""self help"" categories. His approach to life and insight into what it takes to be happy is second to none. I have been reading and rereading his stuff for years now, and I am always excited and ready to take on the world when I finish one of his books. I recommend Mr. Zelinski's books to anyone trying to figure out this ""life"" thing we are all engaged in. ""How to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free: Retirement Wisdom That You Won't Get from Your Financial Advisor"" is another home run from the Zelinski line up."
5,Look No Further,"If you are looking for THE book on creating a meaningful and fun retirement, look no further--this is IT! ""How to Retire Happy, Wild and Free"" is more than just a retirement book; it is an exercise in finding and re-inventing the Real You that somehow got lost in the ""wonderful world of work"".Before reading Ernie Zelinski's book, I was a 63 year old woman who considered retirement to be ""just hanging around and waiting to die"". I now realize that it is entirely up to ME to create a totally new and exciting life for myself. If I get bored, it is MY fault.As you may have guessed, I've quit my job (my last day is tomorrow!), and I can't wait to get started with the next chapter of my life.Definitely read this book if you have any doubts about retirement.Onward and Upward...."
3,Not what I thought it would be....,"I purchased this to help me plan for retirement. It is not a book that helps you plan, it is more of a book that tells you about the mind set you need to have.I was a bit disappointed in that, but it is a good read."
3,"Delivers enthusiasm, but not much usable advice","The best idea I got from the book was to dedicate myslf to writing a retirement book like Mr. Zelinski. It's well-intended, but more of a ""rah-rah"" than a ""how-to ""."
1,Not really impressed,"I quit reading it half way through. It focused too much on ""Don't Worry-Be Happy"". It is much harder to be happy if you don't have enough retirement money. It needs advice on money, insurance, wills etc. etc."
1,"Kind of a ""what color is your parachute"" repetition","I should have read more of this book in the bookstore before buying. If you already know what you want to do with retirement, or at least have the basic ideas in place, this is an almost useless book. Started reading, then skimmed it and put it on the shelf. Nothing significant in it on the total package of retirement issues, and thin on substance. As others have commented, it could have been written clearer in one-third of the number of pages. A disappointment."
1,A great idea but poorly written,"My wife and I are preparing for retirement in our mid-fifties -- twelve years from now. (Yes, we like to start planning early.) The title and summary on Amazon intrigued me so I purchased this one along with some other books that specialize in the non-financial aspects of retirement. This book is, unfortunately, not of the caliber we experienced in our other finds. It is poorly written to the point of being frustrating in its redundancy -- so much so that my wife stopped reading it after getting halfway through. The book does have one redeeming feature: the author has a very good idea on building an interest tree of what you'd like to do with your future free time. This idea is probably worth the price of the book, but don't bother to read anything other than that chapter."
4,Be aware of duplicate material,"This book is an entertaining read but there are large chunks of word by word identical passages with his other book ""The Joy of Not Working"". One book is a good read, reading both feels repetitive. Since this is the newer of the two, its the one I would recommend."
4,Awesome!,"After reading this book, I felt more comfortable in regards to retiring! At first I had my reservations about leaving the teaching profession; however, after reading this twice, I have decided that it's time to relax and enjoy life without the everyday stress in today's classrooms and all the bureauracy involved.Thank you for having such a wonderful book! I definately recommend it...Jorge Chavera"
1,The same as Joy of not Working,This is pretty much the same book. So get one or the other but not both.
4,Thought provoking retirement planning guide.,"I found this book to offer some helpful, and somewhat amusing, lists of ways to enjoy retirement. I think this would be a good book for someone to read a couple of years before retirement to help prepare for the emotional changes one faces. This book was easy to read, although it was a bit redundent at times (like many books in this genre).Overall, I would recommend this book."
5,Excellent book,"I've read many, many books on retirement, being an author of one myselfThe New Retirement: Revised and Updated: The Ultimate Guide to the Rest of Your Life.Mr. Zelinski's book is optimistic and fun, and promotes a positive aspect of retirement that I like - an opportunity to take control of your time. A good read that focues on some of the all-so-important (but often ignored) non-financial aspects of retirement."
2,Pep talk for the clueless,"This book doesn't offer much in the way of nuts-and-bolts financial advice, other than to suggest (as others have) that you don't need piles of money to find happiness in retirement. Instead it focuses on how to craft a meaningful life, as opposed to vegetating in front of the TV for the next 20 or 30 years. Many bits, e.g., the value of friendships and the importance of diet and exercise, seem painfully obvious, though others may prove helpful. If retirement is drawing nigh and you're fretting about how to fill all those empty hours,the author provides an exhaustive pep talk. For the more resourceful and imaginative reader, it's heavy going."
4,Inspirational and Sound Advice,"This is a fun, easy read with a lot of great advice about the non-financial aspects to consider before retiring. Ernie is right on with his view that so many people can't imagine retiring from their primary career because they've defined themselves by their job and have developed no work/life balance. Everyone who has ever wished to escape the 9 to 5 working world needs to read this book!"
2,Nothing New Here,"Good title, but that is about it. No new ideas, rehash of ideas I've read many times elsewhere. Also, a little too Canadian to be of much use to those not retiring in Canada."
1,Litreally the worst book I have read in a long time.,"I REALLY hate to be negative but this book is not a Guide to Retirement and not a good use of your money. It is a positive, carefree book and full of ideas that you should know already if you have half a sense of adventure. Things like - ""if you are workaholic you are a jerk and shouldn't retire"" or ""if you retire make sure and have plenty of money!""or ""Find a hobby before you retire!"" just aren't helpful. I'm 42 and active-retired."
3,I wish I preview the book more carefully.....not just rely on the rating to buy a book,"I guess I have the wrong expectation.I want to buy a book to get specific information for retirement. The book has ~240 pages. I consider the first three chapters to be “introduction” and it already has 108 pages. I don’t need such a long introduction. I want the meat.Continuing reading the rest, I am disappointing too. The content is not technical enough. Take Health (chapter 4) as an example, I expected to learn how the body changes after 65 and how to take care of myself differently. How does the Medicare system function in general? How will healthcare cost me in general?The only chapter that I enjoy reading is “travel” and “relocating”. Those are new ideas that I can definitely consider in retirement age. Also, about housing – shouldn’t the author talk about retirement community, assisted living and nursing home? I can’t find them yet……"
2,It's already stopped working at 2 months old!,"Ok, I loved this machine for the first two months. It picks up dirt I never knew I had. It's easy to operate and empty. The tools are also a nice feature. I'm very disappointed that it stopped working already. When vacumming, it has started turning itself on and off causing all the lights in the house to dim when it does this. After a few minutes, it just completely stops working at all. The headlight comes on but no motor. It would be a nice vacuum if it was reliable."
1,i own it and it doesn;t work i got no satisfaction from com,"I own this vacuum , it;s only 3mopnths olcand i donen;t work, i this is the 2nd one that i had the first one i send back because it was defected and this doesnlt work it is also defected, and i can; get any response form the manufactor,"
1,Do not buy this vacuum,This is my third Fantom vacuum. And it is by far the worse vacuum that I have ever purchased. It does not work well and it is very very heavy to push. It does not pick up well. This vacuum was not build by someone who knew how to build a vacuum or has ever used one. I will never buy another Fantom... Thank you
1,great at first and problems,"I purchased a similar model, fantom twister 500dx deluxe upright refurbished from overstock.com. Got it April 25, 2005. The suction was great and like the feature of emptying the dust container. After a few months there were problems. When you turn on the vacuum, there seems to be an electrical problem. the vacuum runs and stops a little bit and runs again. One of the wheels came off and the vacuum lost suction. Do not buy any fantom products!"
4,at last it's here,"this was one of my favorite records of 1979.tom evans singing and song writing are in top form and some of his best songs are on this cd. i wish elektra would have struck to their original plan for the bonus tracks to be demos instead of these throw away tracks. i feel these bonus tracks takes away more than it adds.hopefully rhino records will come through with the release of badfinger's truly last record ""headfirst"". this will be the one to add to your collection."
2,DON'T BUY!!!,"* Fan noise is loud and annoying* Supplied scents are overwhelming* As an air freshener, NOT any better than the scented oil warmer, ie, Air Wick* Does NOT humidify the air* Does NOT clean dust/pollutantBottom line - over priced air freshener and definitely not worth $60."
1,Don't Buy,"This product is not worth buying.. It does the job of making the air more pleasant however the built quality is terrible... it is made of weak plastic material that breaks after a couple of month of use and changes color. also the led lights got burnt after on 2 month of use, mine has only 1 working led light. If you are looking for a similar product try searching for something else .. Once more don't buy.."
1,Cheap Quality,"I've now owned two of these items due to the cheap plastic bowl. The oils deteriorate the integrity of the bowl and also cause irreversible staining. No one wants this item sitting out in the open for everyone to see when the bowl, even empty, looks like some rancid, never cleaned fish bowl. The first machine I owned, I thought it was my fault because I used authentic essential oils and figured the real oils were just too potent for the plastic to handle. Nope, the second unit did the same thing and I only used the air revitalizer refills made for the machine. I can honestly say $50 is over priced for the product quality of this unit. If you truly want better quality for a similar product, look into the GOODSPHERE Air Purifier and Deodorizer; the popular auction website sells US compatible units for cheap."
3,Brethe Air,"Works really good, without the scents that come with it. Moisturizes the air, don't know if it really cleans it, but doesn't last long. This is my second and they die after a few months. The oils you put in them are just gross, but it definitely provides the humidity.Think I'll just stick to humidifiers as they last longer."
3,worked great until it broke,"I loved this as soon as I bought it. I honestly didn't care for any of the scents except for the lime, which was wonderful. The whole house smelled like fresh limes, but it also felt cleaner, not just a coverup. Then the motor broke after a few months, and the repair process wasn't worth it. So it went into the garbage. I might get another one, but the initial cost is pretty steep and the scent variety is so limited. I'm using soapstone oil warmers now, and find that although they only scent one room at a time, there are so many other varieties of scents available that it's much more fun and offers way more variety in scents to freshen my home."
3,It works but...,"It works - I'm not sure why, but it does. The water will even appear dirty when you empty it. And it looks cool. The problems are...- it's loud. not really loud, but somewhere between my computer and my dishwasher.- the smell is too powerful when you first fill it and fades after just a few hours.- it'll help oders for up to 24 hours. You have to dump and refill it (water + a few drops of the scent) every day and rinse every few days."
4,so far-- very impressed!,"All the good (and some of the bad) points brought up by other reviewers apply.I use only a fraction of the recommended amount of fragrance additive-- mostly let the water ""do the work""But, so far, I'm very, very pleased with the results.One downside for me-- won't work on a AC timer device-- I wanted to have it turn on automatically in the morning, not possible."
3,Good idea but...,"This is an adequate humidifier and a good way to disperse nice fragrance in home. The mystic blue lighting is calming also. However, it is too noisy for my taste, especially when you are listening to music or watching TV. Also, for some reason, the transparent water holder started showing cracks. I don't know if it is caused by shipping/handling or the water spinning itself."
4,I'm glad I own this Air Revitalizer,"I was hesitant about purchasing this product due to the negative reviews but I am glad I decided to take the plunge. Yes, the oils can be powerful smelling IF you use recommended dose. Obviously use less oil. It's all about personal preference. To put it simply, the revitalizer works- it removes bad odors. The sound is about as subtle as a brand new fan. I also love the lime scented oil that comes with it. I gave this product 4 stars because the pleasing smell lasts only for 4 hours but bad odors don't return."
3,Homedics Breathe Air Revitilizer,"The fragarence isn't nearly as long lasting as I had hoped, for the cost. The scents are a bit vague, citrus is not very sharp and the lime is almost the same as the citrus, but then of course, lime is citrus...isn't it. All in all it's great when you need a quick freshener in case someone is dropping by in a few minutes, but the long lasting effects are slight. Advertisement talks about *rain forest mist* and I don't get any of that feeling at all. In my opinion it is a bit pricey for the effects in general. You get the same effect from aromatherapy essential oils and they are much cheaper and organic."
2,"If you like Pinesol, you'll love it","If you like the smell of Pinesol cleaner, you will probably love the scents included with the Brethe Air Revitalizer. Unfortunately, neither my husband nor I are one of those people! To me, all of the different scents of both products smell the same -- a very overpowering disinfectant type smell. I could not tell you if it is the vanilla, lime or citrus scent that is in the Brethe unit at any given time. Since I bought 2 units at the same time, I will try to figure out how to make them useful without giving myself and my husband major headaches from the smell! The recommended ""dose"" of fragrance is 2 capfuls. I will cut way back on that and hope for the best (and hope that the manufacturer comes out with a new type of additive)."
3,Loved it while it worked,"It does exactly what it says it does, cleans the air, freshens bad smells. It worked extremely well at combating litter box odor. The scents are very overpowering, but work well. It takes about 8 hours for it to empty. My only complaint is that after a year it flat out stopped working, nothing to fix, just dead. It seems that filtered water was not good enough for it, calcium built up and it died. If you decide to purchase this, make sure you do not use tap water, even filtered water, only use distilled water!"
2,Has potential but needs works,Interesting product. I bought it as an alternative to another brand that i could not find. The other brand was in my hotel and it appeared to be very well made. This unit is made of cheap plastic and seems to degrade over time. It has not been moved yet cracks are building up for no apparent reason. I only just discovered the cracks after spending days tring to find someone who had the liquid in stock. The liquid is not readily accessable anymore. Had i known I would have not bought the machine. The lavender smells more like a household cleaner then say a relaxing spa like experience. Disapointed but teally wish it was like the one I had in the hotel room.
1,"Complete junk, got a replacement and they both broke","This device was not meant at all to be turned on continuously which is the way I wanted to use it. After a short amount of time, the plastic bowl gets cracks in it and the water leaks out. Amazon sent me a replacement and the new one had the exact same problem. It also comes with junky chemical scents that I'd recommend not using.I guess it was OK when it worked or if you want to use it only a few hours a day but that was not my use case."
2,Loved it while it worked,"I was excited to get this product as it's something different than your typical home air freshening products. And much to my delight, it indeed did a very good job at it's intended purpose. My favorite scent was the lime. However, after about a month, it broke. I had read mixed reviews about the reliability, but took a chance. Oh well..."
2,Awful smells!,I tried the liquid that came with the product. It was terrible smelling!I tried other oils but they stuck to the sides!Not a real good product. Sorry I ordered it.
5,Homedics Brethe air Revitelizer,Wonderful product. I have purchased one for myself and three as gifts. I would hate to be without this ....Rids your home of all odors..Amazing
2,Just OK,"The Brethe Machine is just OK.. Not quite what I was expecting. I mean it does make the air smell like the included scents. As far as actually making the air ""CLEAN"", I don't think it does that.."
5,It really works,"I bought the air revitalizer because I have dogs and a cat and I didn't want my house to smell like I have dogs and cats! When I bought it, I lived in a one story house. It worked great. (The only scent I've used is vanilla.) I don't think the sound is too loud, but I lived in a large house. When my house was for sale, I used it everyday and the house had a nice scent. I moved to a two story house, and didn't think it would scent as much of the house. I placed it in my entryway near the stairs and it scents most of the downstairs and upstairs from that location. I am impressed and very glad that I have it."
1,OVERPRICED glorified air freshener,"I would like it if it worked well....I received it as a gift, never would pay this much for PLASTIC!!!!!I can't stand the noise, the whooshing of the water and the aromas are gross and fake. It doesn't take the odors away it covers them up!Use a real essential oil if you get a headache like I did, from the nasty scents they use.Remember to use distilled water in it.I gave it away, back to good quality incense..."
3,Expected more from this item,"l bought this item about a month ago. Fast shipping ( as usual).Easy assembly, looks great BUT what a dragg. lt needs constantly to be refilled with water. The tank is just toooo small.lt can only be filled to half each time so don't let the look of the tank fool you.lf you go above half, the water spills out, it is not waterproof on the seal. The noise didn't bother me at all. lt's not loud as l thought ( after reading some reviews, i was worried ). lt's a silent humming to me.Most scents work well, at least for a few hours.Overall, good idea to have it near a sink or you walk yourself tired to refill. Nice blue light, soothing. Works well."
1,Disappointed,I made my purchase 3 months ago. When it worked it performed well...A week ago I cleaned and refilled the system and it would not turn on and has not worked in over a week... I good night light... Very Disappointed...
4,JUST BOUGHT IT.........,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT ABOUT 2WKS AGO AND I AM REALLY NOT SURE IF I SHOULD JUST GET A FULL REFUND.I NEEDED MORE ASSURANCE AS I HAVE A MNTH TO KEEP IT.IT DOES MAKE THE HOUSE SMELL VERY SPA-LIKE AS THE OILS IS NOT STRONG AT ALL.NUMBER 2,IT DOES REVITALIZED THE COOKING SMELL THAT USUALLY LINGERS FOR HOURS AND LASTLY IT CREATES SUCH AMBIENCE ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT WITH THE BLUE SOFT LIGHT.ONE THING I DISLIKE IS THE SMELL STAYS ONLY FOR FEW HOURS N ITS EXPENSIVE FOR A SMALL BOTTLE."
4,Air Revitalizer,I bought this a couple months ago. I live in Germany and the dry winter air sucks the moisture right out of everything. A friend had one and I really liked it. My only complaint that keeps me from giving it the 5 stars is the scents and the price. I think it's a bit more expensive than need be and the scents do smell really strong. A couple of reviewers likened it to that of a public restroom and they were right. I do think the scents need to be modified. I don't even use them at full or even half strength anymore because they tend to gag you in the first couple of hours. My neighbors across the hall can smell it. I do like the fact that it made the air in this small apartment more tolerable. The sound of the motor is barely noticable. It's no louder than the water cooler or the computer.
2,Fan went bad,"Worked for the winter season.fan is going, took it apart and sprayedit with some cleaner, worked for a few days..A bad bearing I guess..Why can't they build these things with quality parts?"
2,Overall disappointing,"I used this for a few days and returned it. I had to add scents every couple of hours to keep the room smelling fresh. After a while, it just seemed silly to have created this new ""job"" of having to remember to add scents to this product several times a day. There's got to be a better way than this!"
4,SCENTS ARE EXPENSIVE!,WOW the refill bottles of scents are real expensive... would have never thought that.... the scents do smell like cleaning solutions (pine sol) BUT better than smeeling smoke/dog.
2,Not the greatest,"This definitely smells up a place - and quickly. But you have to like the smell and I find it somewhat chemically, even though it's supposed to be natural. And it gets overpowering quickly. I also think it covers up, rather than eliminates odors."
1,Very unhappy with product performance and durabilty,"Very disapointed one had to be replaced three days after using, now 2nd one is cracking also, in places that wouldnt; be bumbed into, the mateial will not hold up under what it is designed to do. Also it will not take odors out of air, as advertised, it only masks them, as soon as it is unplugged pet ordors, dust, etc, cand still be smelled. Way over priced for what would a can of air fresherner would have exactly the same effect. We purchased two of these because of advestisment, and would not have bought any had we known how poorly constructed and inefective the product is."
1,PIECEOF CRAP!!!!,"This device might be tolerable if every scent didn't smell like pine sol. Also this thing is LOUD! and that blue light. I have no idea who thought of this but it is a terrible idea. You cannot turn off the top light so trying to sleep with it on is a waste of time. And even if you cover the top light you then would have to deal with the noise. This device really needs to be redesigned, it sucks."
3,Homedics BRT-150 Brethe Air Revitalizer,Product is interesting.We use it without the provided scent fluids. Our idea is to just increaseroom humidity during low humidity days.Does it remove germs and clean the air? We really don't know.It is sort of interesting to watch the water swirl around in theglow of the unit's blue light.Clearly this item is a gadget but if you like that sort of thing youmay like this gadget.
3,I am In The Middle On This One...,"I am torn on this.It is a plastic bowl with lights, looks pretty neat, really isnt loud and annoying.The scents that come with it are the only ones I have tried.I dont really like any of the scents, I have played around with the amount that I put in.I LOVE citrus but the citrus that comes with it, is not even close to the citrus smells I am used to.The vanilla is the best out of the 3, but still not what I really prefer my house to smell like.It is good that it makes the scents go thru my home, but I just want something that really smells good..........."
3,Works pretty well,"I love the fact that it creates white noise i was thinking of buying a seprate machine just for that and that alone would cost me $40, the light blue lights are a great replacment for a night light the only complaints i have are that the scents that it comes with are pretty terrible...but those can be replaced with just regular essential oil, and the fact that it doesnt really humidify the air, and even if it did...the tank is to small to put a significant amount of water into the air anyways...pretty good if u dont expect a miracle"
3,The scents don't seem to work,"I don't really notice the scented oil after the first few moments, so that sort of defeats the purpose, doesn't it? The citrus does smell like public bathroom deodorizer. I think the only reason I smell it at all is I get some of that oil on my hand when I open the bottle. It's not easy to squirt the stuff out without making a mess. And the water in mine is lasting too long, which makes me think it's not evaporating like it's supposed to. And my water has yet to get dirty. So how is this doing anything it's advertised to do?"
1,Super silly item,"Yes, I was suckered in. I thought it sounded like a nice alternative to scented candles and it would eliminate a humidifier purchase. OHHHHH no! This machine puts out no water at all, the scents were a little cheesy (like public restroom air freshener) and it was WAYYYYY overpriced. I took it back."
1,Air Revitalizer,"Nice idea, but did not work for me. I wanted something that would help with the cat box odor. This did not work. Item was returned for full refund."
2,Not worth the cost!,Life span of 2-3 months. Have purchased 3....In the beginning they were way under $100....now they are over $200. Not worth it.
5,Have two of them and love them,"I have two of these. I use one in my livingroom and one in my family room. They DO work and work well. I have 3 cats and a dog. When the brethe machines are running the air in the house feels fresh and smells good. I do agree that the vanilla scent is horrible. The lime and citrus are ok, but I like the lavender the best. It smells wonderful. I thoroughly believe this does clean the air to some extent. When I turn mine off the remaining water had a brown tint to it a lot of the time. Obivously the Brethe is not going to be as effective as an air purifier, but it doesn't make those claims. I believe it does exactly what it says and I am very happy with it."
1,Don't Bother,"You will waiste your money if you buy this. It is no more than a glorified fifty dollar air freshner. If you expect anything else from this product you will be disappointed. However, if you want a high priced different looking air freshner that can flood your home with scents in minutes this is the product for you."
1,Not what I expected,"This product is little more than a glorified air freshener. After seeing the testimonials on the Brethe infomercial, I purchased two at Bed Bath & Beyond. It does not clean the air, as they say, and it does a poor job of humidifying.The machine is ugly, with blue lights that shine on the water you can turn off, and a bright blue light on top that stays on continuously (even when the Brethe is off); which along with the loud motor, makes it obtrusive in any room.It comes with three scents, lime and citrus, which both smell like bathroom cleansers; and a nauseating vanilla. Lavender may be purchased separately and is a bit more tolerable.Don't waste your money... If you want an air freshener or oil diffuser, there are cheaper ones out that that do the job better and smell a lot better. If you want an air purifier, this simply isn't it."
2,Too wide and too optimistic?,"I read this book as a first introduction to OO real time computing. I liked the introduction that covers the three topics of OO, RT systems and fault tolerance (though it does not connect the three topics in any sense). I gave up reading the book after the chapter on method, though I skipped through the remaining chapters. The rest of the book was mainly old stuff on waterfall models and OOA/OOD. The whole book was also very commercial and connected to a specific product from the company that the author works for. There was no comparison to other (in my opinion superior) methods and tools.Instead of buying this book I would recommend you to buy an established book on real time systems and an established book on OO. You will end up spending less money and get a better overview of the two fields by reading fewer pages."
2,Spend your money elsewhere,I'd have to go along with the last 2 readers reviews. This book provides a brief summary of a lot of issues but provides no real substance. A lot of the examples just demonstrate the author's past experience with no explanation as to how you would apply them to your own. There are better books out there for designing systems with UML.

THE FIRST TIME I PLUGGED IT INTO MY ZEN VISION M, IT BROKE APART AT THE PLUG TO THE PLAYER.

5,INTERESTED IN CONTEMPORARY ART?..... A MUST READ!!,"Dorothy & George Saxe are amongst the foremost collectors of art made from traditional craft materials...glass, clay, wood, fiber...art categorized as coming out of the Post WWII Arts & Crafts movement. This book beautifully documents that part of their collection now on view at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco.Tim Burgard, Curator of American Art at the DeYoung Museum, writes accessably with the voice of a scholar. He contextualizes this art movement and documents the show from the Saxe Collection that he's recently installed at the DeYoung...THIS IS A GORGEOUS BOOK.The Saxes have made a bequest to the DeYoung of 600 works of art from their collection. This book and exhibition documents more than 1/3 of these objects.A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN CONTEMPORARY ART!!"
3,"Fast, easy, and interesting.","I picked up this book off the New Titles shelf at the library. The jacket blurb looked interesting. Having never read anything by the author, I thought I would give it a try. While the subject matter was okay, I found the writing to flow very easily and very quickly. I was pulled into the story so smoothly that even though I thought Will was more than a bit whiney, I began to care about what was going to happen long before he did. Mr. Wilson, writes a fast-paced, suspenseful and ultimately satisfying tale. I read it through to the end in just a couple of hours. None of my health problems are life-threatening, but I certainly would love to meet a healer like Maya. I'd like to think I would be less resistant to her teachings, were I in Will's position."
1,Predictable and poor,"This entire book can be predicted by the time you've reached page 5. Characters are hollow stereotypes. The adventures are ho-hum as you KNOW that the two main characters must survive. Even the eventual relationship that develops between the two would have been given a C- in a high-school creative writing class.Predictable, boring, poop. Was this really written by F. Paul Wilson, or were a few key sentences dropped into some kind of ""novel generator"" software that just churned out a few hundred pages?"
4,Beyexpert on dragoonstorm,"If your looking for a durable blade base, no do not by this blade. The spinner at the very bottom stinks!! its like plastic, and if you use it to much, the bottom will wear out. its a good blade, especially with it's weight disk! Just customize it with a defense or endurance type."
3,careful,The battle system is awkward and repetitive but you have to grind a lot. I like Symphonia and Vesperia the best.
3,So-So,"It's not terribly good, but it's much better than the first one. I actually had something that resembled fun while playing it."
2,"WHERE IS ""FIRE ON HIGH??"" WHERE>>WHERE?????","It's amazing to me that this set would not feature the great cut ""FIRE on HIGH!"" And if you play it BACKWARDS..well, should I tell you?...OK, it says audibly..""The Message is in the MUSIC..The Messgae is in the MUSIC!"" Not only did not the GREAT UNDERGROUND radio STATION BC,(before country),KSAN in SF and the DJ's know that secret until I pointed it out to them..and STILL WE CAN'T GET THAT SONG ON A REMASTERED GREATEST HITS>>>>>BS. BUT I LOVE the ELO even though they could never reproduce their sound LIVE and IN CONCERT! ALL THE BEST FOLKS...Drag out your old ""IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY"" ALBUM...,It doesn't rip you off! ERICK V (DREAMBO)"
5,"Bob from Littleton, CO","With Flashback, Jeff Lynne has boldly reclaimed ELO's legacy as one of the most talented and original acts in rock history. Whethter you're an avid ELO fan or merely a pop enthusiast, Flashback is guaranteed to put a smile on your face. The 3 CD's trace an amazing evolution of rock'n roll sound, from the lush orchestral arrangements that marked ELO's early hits, to the more restrained guitar rock of the mature Jeff Lynne. Through it all, the instantly recognizeable melodies, whymiscal lyrics and dreamy arrangements carve out ELO's niche in the pantheon of greatest rock'n roll bands. As if a brilliantly re-mastered retrospective wasn't enough, Jeff Lynne has added several unreleased, new tracks, new arrangements of old ELO standards, and a snappy version of ""Xanadu"" that's sure to whet your appetitie for the new ELO album in April of 2001. Listen to just one CD in this set, and you can't help but think, ""Welcome back, Electric Light Orchestra - we missed you."""
4,They Almost Got It,"How can you release an ELO box set and not include ""Fire On High""? They did not include it on the 1990 Afterglow box set, either. An outrage!"
5,Go to a better place with ELO,"Listening to this collection, I am amazed at the artistry of Mr. Jeff Lynne. This remastered collection sounds UNREAL. Music that you can lose yourself in. AAAA++++"
4,Audio excellence,"Welcome back Jeff. It is great to see Jeff Lynee embracing the ELO legacy that he left behind. This collection is an attempt to reclaim ELO from the ELO II effort led by Bev Bevan. The included booklet on the band makes it perfectly clear that everything ELO did was Lynne's work with assistance from Richard Tandy and everyone elese was just players. The strength of this set is the exceptional audio quality of the remastered songs. Sonic details I have never heard come out clearly. You can rediscover these songs. The notes are sketchy and don't shed a lot of light on the songs or on the band's development. Afterglow had much better material included. The unreleased songs are okay, not nearly as interesting as the unreleased tracks on Afterglow but hey any new ELO is okay with me. All in all a good treat for avid fans with great packaging. Sets the stage nicely for the new ELO album in 2001."
5,POW! Very strong remasters!,"One additional comment on the excellent job of remastering these classic recordings.As a musician myself, I could never quite get my rocker buddies on the ELO bandwagon back in the 70s, mostly because no matter how I loved the songs, the originals rarely had the ""crunch,"" in the form of bass and drums, that is the stuff of hard rock. In this boxed set, Jeff Lynne has ""put the crunch in"", and you can really hear it in the results! The drums and bass are upfront and a lot crisper, with the result that the songs have a lot more bite than they used to. Now they finally pack the wallop that they always aspired to.Bravo!"
5,"Great Set, But What About...2","I love this stuff, but my goodness, I remember ""Fire On High"" from the album ""Face the Music"" as a staple on the progressive rock (now classic rock) stations of the 70's. It's still a great, hip tune. How could Jeff Lynne not include it in this set?"
4,SanFran Bay Coffee,"Very good coffee; but, wish your Grocery listing had said that the product was not ground. I had to go to Trader Joe's to grind it."
2,Eats batteries,"Sounded like a good idea.It's handy, light, easy to use.It also fades fast if you leave it on a little too long, and the battery gets drained way too quickly. PUtting one in the corner for convenience's sake is not so convenient when you have to fetch new batteries every fifth tap."
1,May be it was good...,"My item was stolen on the way, so I never got a chance to see what it was like. What a shame..."
4,"Fun, fun, fun!","I'll be honest. I've never seen this thing in real life. But the commercial, man... I've seen it millions of times, and I'm convinced this is the best thing anyone could own."
2,Not enough light,"I purchased a case of these to add a little light to the cubby holes that our employees work in. The light was so dim it actually made it more dreary than not having the light at all. It is okay for a night lite, but nothing more."
4,Works good!,"The tap lights are very handy. I just moved into a new place and there are lights that were needed in many places so I figured these tap lights would be PERFECT! I ordered 6 of them and the only problem I ran into was one of them did not work. When I shook it, I could hear something metal bouncing around inside it. I'm in the process of returning it for a new one."
1,Dead in three days. Do not buy these.,"I bought a two pack and both were dead in three days. Day two, the bulb housing snapped and it rattled.I disassembled them and they just aren't wired properly. The batteries are always being drained even if the switch is off, so they're not going to be useful for more than a few days at a time, then you'll be out 4 more AA batteries.I should also mention they use cheap solder and bad quality wires that had black soot on them. I really hope it was from the initial soldering and not because they got that hot.In short: If only they weren't wired so poorly they'd work just fine. They put out enough light for what you'd probably need them for, but having to replace the batteries every couple of days is just out of the question."
4,Prompt delivery,"I bought this cd once from Starbucks and really enjoyed the collection of artists and songs it included. I somehow lost it and found it on amazon again, and quite surprised to find it for a lot less than what I originally paid; And, was shipped and delivered within 2 days. I was pleasently surprised. It offers great music, and I know you'll enjoy it."
1,45 Dollars for 8 days?!?!,"I've taken several versions of this formula living in China. It has effectively treated me, and I would recommend this herbal formula, provided it's quality is assured, to anyone with appropriate symptoms. However, 45 dollars is an absurd price to pay for a bottle. The recommended dosage is 24 pills a day, which leaves you with a little over a week for a bottle. If you take this product for a month, you'll spend almost 200 dollars. That said, I've been spending between one and two dollars a bottle here in China, and I've seen it fairly marked in the US for between 5 and 10 $/bottle. But this is what they call highway robbery. Buyer be warned!"
5,Places where we buy: a very important topic.,"This is truly a fine investigation into the design, construction, and experience of sales environments -- not just in the physical world, but also in the virtual worlds of TV, radio, print media, and the Internet. Sherry is an anthropologist who, together with the other contributors, paints a complex portrait of what it means to create a sales environment, what it means to experience one, and how the two processes relate. No marketing ace or designer can afford to do without Sevicescapes!"
4,A good book,"Out of all the books I have read on this subject, this is one of the better ones. Unfortunately, there needs to be better books on this subject. There is so much left out of all the books I read, that I still didn't have a high level of confidence in making the purchase, and relied a lot on my previous business experience. However, this book did a good job of getting the process started, and sent me in the right direction. I eventually found a business. Someone needs to write a book on all the details to pay attention to in the acquisition process, and why. It would be a good alternative to the expensive price of paying professionals to educate you."
1,Did not work for me,"I put generic mountain dew in the bottom of a soda bottle, let it sit overnight, and the next day I saw a bunch of wasps flying around my backyard but none made it to the trap. :("
4,Worked for me,I used a small 12oz plastic soda bottle. I tried it first with sugar water. That didn't work. Next I tried about 1 and 1/2 inches of orange juice. I get about 20 bees a day. Went back to purchase more two weeks later and they were all gone.
3,TOO SLOW !!!,I bought this product so I can run Microsoft Visual Studio .Net from my Mac (A Dual 1.25 GHz PowerPC G4/2 MB L3 Cache / 1.25 GB SDRAM). I spent $249.00 dollars for VPC. This is thing is too darn slow! I ended buying an eMachine with Windows XP Professional ($600). Now I use the Remote Desktop Connection program from the Mac. Know it feels that I have a PC on my Mac (Yuck!).
4,Significant Thinking,"What would the USA be like today if former slaves had were given the elusive ""40 acres and a mule""? How are the black poor in America different from the white poor everywhere? Although I haven't yet read this book, I am familiar with the dissertation on which it was based. This book is a definate must read for anyone with an interest in poverty, ethnic studies or our modern power structure. Conley successfully anayzes the connection between poverty and property that will no doubt leave many readers with a fresh perspective on the hows and whys of many ""underclass"" issues. I am anxiously to read this updated version."
3,It Takes A Village (and more),"This is truly a groundbreaking book. Dalton Conley finally reveals the key element on pg. 118 in two unassuming little words: reserve stock. This is, ladies and gentlemen of the judging class, what separates the races and classes, NOT skin color or intelligence level. In the absence of such, no one can truly believe (except in fairy tales) that most people can overcome grinding poverty and helplessness to become productive members of society. Aside from mere technical support, that cherished ""reserve stock"" allows one entrance into arenas not usually penetrable via associations with those generous enough to usher one in. Trying to overcome the obstacles of poverty is like trying to drag a car without snow tires up a steep hill. I commend the youthful yet astute Dalton Conley for his valuable work."
1,Crap,"This book is very rambly and boring, it fails on all levels. The author fails to answer any of the questions posed in a coherent and intelligent manner. This appears to be the work of an evangelical Christian extremist from the American Bible belt.Please avoid!"
3,not as i expected,"The size and shape are excellent, just what I was looking for. However it wasn't as bright as I wanted. Perhaps a thinner white so that more light can come thru."
1,Bad light,"I bought it to light my small closet, but it doesn't work, I cannot see anything, it is too poor.Orribile item, the light doesn't illuminate anything. I through away it!!!"
2,for fans only,"cant said its what i was hopping for..mostly interviews - no music ,no shows and no radiohead on those dvd'sjust people from the industry talking about them.so for fans only i guess.."
4,The Fat DVD Box,I ordered this before 10 days and now it's in my hands ! The delivery from the USA to CROATIA took only 10 days ! Amazing Amazone ! :)I still haven't opened the box because it's for my brothers Birthday.....I wonder why the two reviews so bad are.Anyway I still think my brother will enjoy his Present !
2,Lullabyes...,"If you want some music to put you (or your little one) to sleep, this will do it. The CD as a whole is just short of monotonous, and the songs are almost interchangeable. I am a Crystal Gayle fan, owning most of her CDs and tapes, and have seen her live maybe 12 times...well, maybe it's because I don't have kids..."
4,Nice length for small space,"Fits well in a cozy spot & the four feet of cord was nice for the corner. Not so long that one would be tripping over it but long enough to lay between the computer & printer, which sit on two different pieces of furniture."
1,False Advertising,"I now have two copies of this game that do not work with XP. Thought new version was created and neglected to read prior feedback. My Mistake, I guess. Should be able to return for full refund."
2,millionaire game,"I purchased this with very little information about which version it was and I took a chance it was later than the one I already owned. BAD DECISION! I already have 2nd Edition and wanted one more updated and this one did not have anything identifying which edition it was. It is pretty much the same as the 2nd Edition. Same questions/answers.There should be more information relating to the game and which version it is.Unfortunately, it can not be returned once opened and there was no way to tell before opening it."
3,The game works on XP,"If you tried to play the game and you got the message: 'EngineStart Application has encountered a problem and needs to close'Just do this...1. Go to the directory containing the application. This directory is located in ""Program Files"". For the first edition of Millionaire, this is ""Program Files\Disney Interactive\Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"". For the 2nd edition of Millionaire, this is ""Program Files\Buena Vista Interactive\Who Wants To Be A Millionaire 2nd Edition"".2. Look for a directory called ""jre"". Go into it.3. Look for a directory called ""bin"". Go into it.4. Look for a file called ""symcjit.dll"". Delete this file."
4,Not only the Titanic sunk,"On our honeymoon sail on Lake Superior for the first time we met our skipper, James Keller who is the author of this wonderful little book. He is a historian and teacher who captures the shipwrecks and rescues of 21 losses on Superior's hazardous inland waters. He has scuba dived many of the remaining wrecks and gives great details of both past and present equaling or exceeding the Titanic story in the early 1900s. Highly recommended"
4,An entertaining historical review,"A well-researched, easy-reading chronicle of an interesting if somewhat remote corner of the Great Lakes. I recommend this to anyone interested in the shipping history of the region. Has several rare photographs which enhance the text considerably."
1,Virtual PC does not work with the G5's,"Virtual PC is not supported by the G5's. If you want to run dual operating systems, do not buy this product or the G5!"
5,Life In Egypt,"Najib Mahfouz in his compact dry story details the hardships faced by the people of Egypt from the economic liberation. Intifah, Anwar Sadat's open-door economic policy has increased disparities between the rich and poor, creating havoc in lives of its citizens. In this economic meltdown is Fawad and his fiance Randa whose commitment for each other is tested by realities of times.In a subtle undertone, this novel has reflections to the struggle faced by masses presently in the middle east. Interesting aspect of this novel are the personal battles faced between self righteousness vs corruption, advancements vs traditions."
4,"Concise, moving and informative","A short novella, written from the viewpoints of three people on the eve of Anwar Sadat's assassination. Two lovers are separated by a poor economy that they both blame on Sadat's open market policy, while the suitor's grandfather provides a continuity with Egypt of the past. Well-written, the book packs a punch out of proportion to the slim book size."
4,Great CD!!!!,"I really like this CD. Being from Fort Worth, TX, I was shocked about the shooting at Wedgewood Baptist Church and just recently found out that Forty Days was there. Each of the songs makes you think about God and what he did for us. Several of the songs they sing are about what happened to them at the church and how their lives were changed forever. It is a great CD and I recommend it!"
3,Some rarities here,"I'm glad I bought this CD - mostly because it contains some songs missing from the other 30's and 40's Big Band Swing CDs I have. Songs like Spike Jones' ""Der Fuhrer's Face"" The Three Suns version of ""Twilight Time"" and different arrangements of songs done by different bands. All in all, a worthwhile buy if you like Big Band Swing and the music that was popular at the time of WWII."
4,Some Of The Greatest Songs Ever Written,"After the Depression and well into the 1940s, songwriters stepped up to the plate and composed songs that boosted morale during those difficult times. This collection provides many of those wonderful tunes-whether love songs, patriotic songs or silly but fun novelty songs. I've played this 3 cd set for my mother and she sang along and reminisced about hearing these songs in her youth during WW2. I only have one small complaint and that is that I much prefer Dooley Wilson's version of As Time Goes By to Rudy Vallee's. One of the loveliest tunes ever composed, I have heard many versions by many artists and I'll always prefer Dooley Wilson's, perhaps because Casablanca is one of my favorite movies of all time. All in all a terrific compilation and a must have for anyone who is into collecting the music of the 1940s."
3,Galidor Fiance',"I'd say this is pretty good. I've been looking to complete my Gailidor collection when I collected these back in 2003, but I never found it in stores. Now I finally found Nick Bluetooth's fiance' (or fiance' in my imagination at least). Nevertheless, this is a good toy if you like action girls."
2,atlanta steve,"I had no problem ordering and quickly receiving this product. I purchased this product to hear the chorus. However, the short sermons of Billy Graham can quickly be skipped over and do not dominate the DVD. I am fairly satisfied with the purchase even though the sound recordings are not the best quality."
5,Best Pickle or Chutney in the World,"Always spread it on any cheese or try it with a Jacket Potato, Grated Cheese and then put the pickle on top..Luscious and chunkyDavidhttp://www.britishchap.com"
1,Can't use this program,"This product offers much to chose from and I really liked the photos. However, I have yet to get this program to work right. I am able to view the photos but when I go into the the Export Wizard to save the photos, the photo has a transparency over the top of it, instead of in the background. I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is ""limited to crashes, error messages and lockups"". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's. There was VERY little about this software and no help to be found. I wasted my money on a product I can't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control."
2,Transparency Problem,"This product is very nice when it works. However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me. When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.I gave it two stars because, for the two months it worked, it worked well, however, now, it won't work at all. And as the other reviewer stated, support is nearly non-existant."
1,Not at all as represented!,"First of all, the many samples I viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles. There are far fewer images than the number touted. This is a scam in my opinion, but a situation I could live with.But The major issue is that most of the photo images I have searched for my actual use have very poor, actually totally unusable resolution. They have corrupted clarity, Poor pixel quality, are distorted, and unsuitable except for perhaps, a third grader's school project.It was a complete waste of money. It is headed for the first garage sale I hold, and I will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy."
3,Just ok,"At first I was excited with the new clip arts I bought. I tried it out, the resolution is good for web projects but not in print. Not all pictures are good. Though, I used some already and I like them. The search software was helpful on browsing what you need. I just say satisfactory."
2,Poor Quality Graphics,"Not worth the money...Poor quality graphics, some looked chopped on the edges...."
5,Outstanding & Intelligent Music-making!,"I cannot recommend this album enough -- outstanding songwriting with intense, intelligent edges. The Brechtian, Third-Reich attitude made so explicit in ""Have I Got a Deal for You"" floats across every song -- even the samba-soaked ""Sunday is the Day for Love"" -- until you realize just how deep, dark and troubling things really are. Repeated listenings will get you past the beautiful arrangements and Abby's marvelous voice and upriver to Mr. Kurtz. Brava, Abby Travis, I hope you get the recognition and wide audience you deserve!"
5,Awesome surge protector with lots of outlets!,"Looking for a great surge protector at a great price , then this is the one!! Built very well with tons of outlets!"
2,Poor workmanship,"Received promptly,but the cable connection on the suppressor is defective. Would send it back,but can use it on a location that does't require a cable input."
4,Tripp Lite Surge Protector,"I bought 2ea. of this surge protector only because I came upon an article about ""How Surge Protectors Work"". The ones I have at home is your typical bought at Walmart type. I was amazed at what can happen to your electronics when your home has a power surge or a lightning strike. I read the reviews for Belkin and others and concluded that this brand was for me.I gave it only 4 stars because I really wouldn't know if it works. By reading all the reviews about Tripp surge protectors, I think I made the right chioce. Only time will tell if I made the right choice."
4,One Annoyance - Otherwise Good.,"Good power strip. Lots of outlets. Good cord length. Like the telephone protection. I would not use the coax protection. Have read articles on dslreports advising against using coax protection from any of the strip manufacturers, none in particular. One annoyance though. The sliding plastic child protection socket covers can pop off very easily exposing bare contacts. If you are clumsy or have children with great dissassembly skills, you will need to see if this is safe for you and/or them. Conditionally recommended. I did buy again."
3,Boooooooo....but it's not the worst game ever,I'm glad this game was inexpensive. It's very easy to play and the graphics are very cheesy. I finished the entire game in less than 30 minutes. It give you no challenge what so ever.I wish *Nsync would come out with a good game like Britney Spears.
5,all n sync fans have to get this game,o my god this n sync game is cool u could do a lot of things on this game u paly 4 differnt games on 3 different levels i love it i can not put this game down i am always playing it if you love n sync than i say get this game u will not be sorry if u doso have playing it and remember n sync are cool (justin) he is drop dead hot
3,Night Light with sensor,"I have two of these night lights and have satisfactorily used them for several years. They use the standard 4 W small lightbulb replacements. It is difficult to get fingers in to unscrew the bulb to change it, but it is never taken me more than a minute or two."
1,Planned Obsolescence,"Gotta break the cover to replace the bulb. Only buy this if you also like cracked covers, and have some heat-resistant scotch tape."
1,Light impossible to replace.,Do not get this light unless you plan on throwing it away after the bulb burns out. Nice features but poor design to replace a burned out bulb.
1,Dies Quickly!,I bought a 6 pack of these lights at costco - all six of them do not work and the manufacturer will not replace them since they only have a one-year warranty. I even replaced the light bulbs and they don't work - this is an awful design and clearly Amertac does not care about their customers.
3,A good book with ideas for your next project.,"I like this book as it covers various subjects on customising your car like top chopping,sectioning,chassis swapping and many other techniques.You will find a lot of ideas in this book.If you are contemplating your next project and you're looking for ideas you should add this book to your collection.Plenty of photos and diagrams but tends to be a bit light on for text in places.Overall,a good quality book.I also recommend this book too:""Standard Guide To Building Street Rods and Custom Cars"" By Ken Wickham.This book is available from this site too."
3,A decent follow-up.,"Not as tremendous as his first, but not a bad follow-up to a great album. Together, the first and second albums are a reminder of how much we have missed of the possibilites of this outstanding artist."
2,Sour kraut,Roughly hewed noise-art gurgling has a slight primitive pull but fails to capitalize on shallow angularities.
5,Very Authentic,I have owned this book for several years. Everytime I use it my home takes on the aroma of my Grandmother's house. I highly recommend this book for your yourself and your friends.
1,A Taste of Puerto Rico,"I did not like this cookbook at all. I own a few ""Puerto Rican"" cookbooks and this cookbook can't compare to the others I have. The recipes were nothing spectacular. I was greatly disappointed when I read the different recipes. Too say the least this cookbook is nothing to write home about."
4,Great presentation and wonderful tasty recipies!,I enjoyed reading this book. Liked the easy reading and the vast collection of puertorican dishes. We need more books like this!
5,A Taste of Puerto Rico: Traditional and New Dishes from the Puerto Rican Community,"I love this cookbook. It is my bible of making traditional and new dishes from Puerto Rico. My mom didn't teach me to cook Puerto Rican food but I grew up eating it and smelling the beautiful aroma of sofito. I have other Puerto Rican cookbooks and they were so complicated to follow that I almost gave up on trying to learn. This book is easy to follow and you really learn the basic and traditions of cooking Puerto Rican tasty, sweet delicious food. This cookbook is a keeper."
2,"nice idea, but falls short","I had a remote control holder, faux leather, which had three felt lined slots or compartments for remotes, and one plush-lined for glasses, with a sort of handle in the middle to pick it up and move it easily. I gave it to my mother to help her keep track of things as she was forever losing her remote and her glasses. She loves it. I bought this wooden holder to replace what I had. This is all they had at the ""Organize It"" store I went to that day. So far it gets a thumbs down. Everything falls over sideways in this, nothing stays in ""it's place"" and forget putting your glasses in there (you'll find them on the bottom). I suspect this will be on the garage sale table by spring. Don't waste your money if you want it for remotes...maybe for some other purpose it might work out."
4,Effective but loud,"The fan easily exhausts the air in our average size home laundry room quickly, making working in the laundry with the washer and dryer running much more pleasant. Installation was a breeze. However, if you are looking for quiet operation, this fan is not for you. The fan noise almost completely masks the noise from the running laundry machines, making for quite a roar when all three are running together."
3,Works grat but LOUD as HELL,"It works well and does the job, but it's REALLY LOUD. I think twice before turning it on."
2,piece of junk,This fan is an absolute piece of junk. the housing is cheaply made and clearance is an issue between it and the fan blades. I got it to replace a sixty year old unit and the quality is night and day difference. A disgrace that this is listed as made in America.
1,not great at all,"I bought the Broan 507 Chain Operated Utility fan on April 19, received it on the 23rd, couldn't get it installed in my kitchen until April 30 and and it's already broken. It's a little shy of one month old after the installation. The chain-pull and the plastic face cover is really cheesy. The chain broke where it connects to the outside damper and now I have to have the contractor who installed it come back and make it switch-on fan and figure out some kind of fix for the damper. I hardly used it. Would love to just return it but it's passed the 30 days return policy, of course. I kept the box just in case, too, because I had a feeling. All in all, I thought it was a pretty expensive item for what I actually received.Broan 507 Chain Operated Utility Fan"
1,Disappointed in Quality,"I'm ashamed to say that this fan is Made in the USA. What junk! My major complaint: The chain must be dragged through a hole in a metal plate to operate the fan. While doing this, the chain becomes stuck and you must giggle it to get it loose. Poor design!"
3,Good introduction to the subject.,"At only 62 pages this was better than I thought it would be. First it is an obscure and often neglected topic of the ""Roman World."" Starting from its inception during the long reign of the Emperor Augustus up to its disbandment. Their recruitment, uniforms, role, history, and equipment are all touched on to varying degrees. The photographs were somewhat more instructive than the color plates which were not nearly as good as Angus McBrides. There is a lengthy bibliography for further research."
4,No way out of it!,"This record, originally bought second hand in 1960, has always been a staple in my collection. It has everything a Griffin record should have and finds him in the period, that his tone was softer, the tonal centre of his sound extremely liquid and flexible, which enhanced the quality of his already intense swing. Also, the rhythm section leaves nothing to be desired with Philly Joe especially impressive. Highlights are a torrid rendering of Cherokee and a lyrical, sensitive Sunny Monday, that features a beaut of a solo by Kenny Drew. Johnny Griffin's sextet record, on which the present quartet was made a sextet by adding Pepper Adams and Donald Byrd and which was recorded at the same session, is also highly recommended. And yes, Naum Gabor's 'The Tulip', that graces Way out's cover, is still one of Rotterdam's main artery 'Coolsingel' special charms for me."
5,a Masterful revelation of the Jesus in the Old Testament,"My boss lent me his copy of this book as I was searching for answers about the Trinity while I was reading James R. White's The Forgotten Trinity. While I read these two books simultaneously and I recognized that I was reading Rambsel's book for pleasure and as a break from White's intense look at the Trinity. I learned so much more about the foretelling of Jesus in the Old Testament. The Jewish perspective on the God/Man through the stories in Genesis were even more enriching to me than the knowledge of secret codes placed there by God. I got the feeling that the codes were put in by God to tell those who put more faith in Science than in Spirit a special message: ""I'm here!"" I believe some of the television specials on the ""Bible Code"" do a better job on explaining it than this book. I learned so much though and was amazed so often that I'm still giving it 5 stars enthusiastically. My boss let me keep the book since I loved it so much."
1,Virtual PC does not work on the G5,"Virtual PC is not supported by the G5's. If you want to run dual operating systems, do not buy this product or the G5!"
2,Works okay,"Be prepared to spend a lot of time getting this going. To begin with, the product I received was not the product advertised as far as packaging was concerned. No Windows O/S was included, so I had to scrounge around and find a copy of XP, and install twice before I could get one to work. I had to learn to ignore various error messages until all updates were installed and then finally (many hours later) it all worked. But hey, I knew going in that it would take some doing to get XP to run on a PPC G4, and didn't have to spend much in the $$ category. It remains a but surreal to see an XP desktop on top of Tiger 10.4.9."
3,"Not Their Best Work, But Not Bad","First off, this is most definitely not the place for a new 999 listener to start. (That would be a toss-up between the self-titled debut and Separates) Having said that, it's not a bad record by any means. As another user has already said, this CD contains the Face To Face LP along with some bonus tracks. Why they didn't name it as such is beyond me. The music is a bit more mellow than their early stuff but the songwriting is still there. Hardcore fans will want to own this."
3,999 Lite,"999 touching? Yes! This is a pretty, plesant album from the same nasty lot that brought you the manic 'Chicane Destination' and the seering 'High Energy Plan' earlier in their career. Please don't expect that if you purchase this CD. Nothing earth-shattering here but that's the whole point. This is the sound of a great punk/pub-rock band relaxing. I think this new CD cover says it all."
2,weak at best,"Both content and footage is anemic at best. Far too much stock footage of people walking around, very little of actual sites.Definite Muslim slant (eg. ""a Muslim neighborhood was torn down to build this plaza"" is a completely irrelevant statement made discrbing the Western Wall plaza). Better title would be ""An editorial about the conflicts surrounding the Temple Mount""Paid $2 for it on on-line and would like my money back. I pine for the days when National Geographic did good stuff."
4,A Primer for Jerusalm,We are planning a trip to Israel and were pleased with the information provided in ths NatGeo product. Recommended as an introduction to the many sites of Jerusalem.
5,Have a relationship with Jesus,This is My favorite dvd ever made to learn about the bible and about Jesus and where He comes from.
3,Secrets of Jerusalem's Holiest Sites,"I received this item as ordered and in a timely manner. The movie itself had a lot of beautiful pictures of the holy land and the architecture of Jerusalem. The presentation was kind of sterile in it's attempt to present the information and left me unimpressed. Although I did not love it, there may be others that may and should take their own chances. As I said, it did have its good points."
1,Very low battery life,"When I purchased the 1st set (4) of 12"" fluorescent lites & the lites failed after a few hours, I returned them to Home Depot, thinking they were defective. I bought another set, & after 165 minutes, 2 of the lites went out.Would someone please verify what the expected battery life should be using (8) ""AA"" batteries."
2,"American Tack 73040 12"" Cordless Fluorescent Light","Lasted about one week. I put in 8 fresh batteries that I had just purchased, so it wasn't the batteries. After one week or so, the light just stopped functioning. I would bave rated it one star, but I liked the idea of no cords."
2,not good,"the lights take alot of batteries which is costly, but the biggest complaint is that with all the batteries they are then ""heavy"" and the velcro strips do not keep the product attached. i put them up under my cupboards and when i came back they had all fallen down. i kept them in case of a storm but they cannot be used with the tape they would have to be installed with screws."
1,Virtual PC does not work on the new G5's,The Virtual PC is not supported by the new G5's. Do not buy this software or the G5 if you want to operate dual operating systems. They have no information as to when or if it will be supported
2,disappointed,"My 4 1/2 yr old son loves dinosaurs and thought this would be a fun game about them. Instead the game had a lot of reading before you could start playing. The games were educational, ie: ABC's, number's, color's but not presented in a fun way...if you didn't get the correct answer you went back to the beginning. We have Reader Rabbit and Jump Start games for the pc and they are much better."
2,ccc,Muy buen producto bello y hermoso lo recomiendo 100% es de muy buen material mucho listo sin novedades dloii cur
3,A good and bad... slightly used?,"So then... I ordered this and a longshot as well (that thing is pretty neat but needs serious work).Looking at the Maverick, it's pretty awesome. I'm psyched about it. Six shots, suction cups... have two so when someone comes over could have fun firing them.I got a closer look the following day, as these came sometime near night. While one of them functions great, the other sometimes didn't want to rotate the barrel when I'd not ready the gun. The other does it smoothly.The good one also I noticed seems to fire constantly. The second, I'm not too sure on but seemed to -fire- just fine... just not rotate when I wouldn't pull the part on top.Also, both guns seem to have probably been roughly handled before coming to my door. Minor scratches on the excellent one, and they both seem to have slight ""dust"" that is possibly from the plastic itself in the factory I guess.Otherwise, and with more use, I'm sure they're a good buy."
5,Good ol Nerf fun!,"Hey, I may be a bit older than the recommended 8 - 12 year old recommended age range but I can still appreciate a cool toy! The Nerf Maverick gun is a well-built, little dart gun. Brightly colored and harmless looking, it cranks out soft, foam suction darts with surprising speed and accuracy. My cats have grown wary whenever they hear the gun being cocked back. Needless to say, if it's recommended for an adult, I'd certainly recommend it for child. At $10 you'll get a lot more play out of the N-Strike Maverick than you would out of a video game. And your kid will have to run around a bit and get some exercise to get the most out of this toy!"
5,Great!,"This isn't a good blaster for a primary. It's a legit sidearm, but the speed and the insane RoF are what makes this thing awesome. It's THE ultimate choice for a Speed Raider. Speed Raiders rush in and deal as much damage possible, and then go for a quick retreat. The small size allows extreme portability. As for range, it goes as much as a heavily modded Scout. (The Scout's terrible, modded it's OK) There is also an insanely easy mod to make the barrel extend further. Mine can be taken out. It's very durable, I have two. One is broken due to a modding accident. I now use that barrel for a clip on my working one."
4,Not AS dangerous as people say,"This is a great toy, but let's just say it won't help raise your little boy as the next Einstein.Kidding aside, it's pretty powerful. It can hurt if fired close-range, but you won't kill someone.The main problem I had was that it's kind of hard to load in the bullets. It's not actually hard, persay, but takes a couple of seconds. If your buddy had a faster loading gun, you'd be...in trouble.Good value."
5,Never had a Christmas morning like this one...,"I was sorry I only purchased two of these for my 10 & 6 year old daughters. My husband loved it, my 13 year old loved it, my brother in law wanted to borrow them to take to his family's Christmas dinner. They were an instant hit!"
4,"Nerf N-Strike Maverick, OK, but not great","Great for a small assault gun, but not meant for quick reloading. If you want to go in and do some quick damage, but not stay in for the long haul, this gun is perfect. Although not the best for long battles, can cause quite a bit of damage to begin the fight with. Even though you have to cock it manually, you can get it to pump out about one round per second (an OK speed for me). Not too accurate. I'm sure there are better guns out there."
3,a return to nerf basics,"having owned nerf guns since 1995,i can say as a semi-expert that this weapon has a self-explanitory action,is easy to use and works as well as my old ratchetblast. also,stashing/hiding it on one's personage is also rather easy. a hooded sweatshirt can easily keep this gun out of sight. one tip for the user:mount a flashlight on the bottom of it,so if a friend has a firefly/glow darts you can easily catch him.i still lose darts,frequently."
5,Maverick,"This is a great sixshooter. Nothing negative to report, except, again, good luck finding replacement darts."
2,Not worth your time or money.,"I own a few nerf guns (So far I own 24) and by far this is the hardest to review.Sure this gun looks cool!Sure it's cheap!But I've owned 4 of these and they have all been thrown out broken a.nd a waste of 12 bucks.They just arn't worth hassle.I like them when I use them; the ranges are good and it's a fantastic sidearm, while it lasts.The old blue mavricks and the new elite strongarm are 100% better than this, don't waste your money here, go find one on ebay.Belive me, I try to like this gun, but I never could.4/10"
1,Came broken,The product was given to my son for christmas. The whole revolver is misaligned and does not work properly. An expensive gun that doesn't work.
2,"Best Nerf Dart Gun, but still not good","I recently bought this gun. I played with it for a few weeks. But one day, I dropped it and it never fired the same. You would have to fire the gun three times or more to get the bullet out. However, it is the best Nerf Dart Gun. I have owned four other dart guns (The Vulcan, the Longshot, the N-Strike 6, and the Big Rocket Shooter). This gun lasted the longest. But, it is not worth the price. If I were selling it, it would be worth three or four dollars. If you don't drop it, it will be fine, but it is definitely not a durable toy. So, either play very carefully, or take the chance."
5,Best Nerf pistol ever,"Hey. I've bought some of the best Nerf pistols out there (nite finder, split shot, secret shot, scout blaster, etc....), and this one is my favorite.Here are my reasons:pros:1. has a good range for a pistol2. carries 6 bullets in a clip3. semi-auto pistol4.my brother keeps on using it and dropping it, and it dosnt break5: good price;$10.cons:1. too heavy and bulky for a pistol(i dont really care that much, but..)2. the load barrel dosnt come out all the way, just a bit and you can spin it to fill in the holes.Overall, this is the best nerf pistol ive seen out there.... its kewl too that it can attach to the titan.HAPPY NERFING!"
1,terrible,it broke the first time i used it. the barrel of the gun is out of adjustment and will not spin the darts to the correct position to launch them.
1,Horrible Nerf Gun!!,"this toy is a PITA! my son has to cock-it each time and most of the time, it doesn't line up properly and won't shoot a ""bullet"". sometimes it doesn't shoot hard enough so that the bullet will stick to a surface.choose something else!!"
2,"I hate this gun,sorry.","My dad originally got this gun for himself. First battle,it worked fine. Next time he couldn't get it to shoot. I eventually got it to work so he gave it to me. Then it started jamming terribly and the pump stopped working. My brother tried to fix it but the piece of junk just got worse.Good points:-rate of fire:this gun shoots fast for a little gun,but it can't aim well you pump and shoot fastBad points:-capacity:it holds six darts. Pathetic if you ask me. It is harder to reload that gun than a CS clip.-range: this gun shoots ok for range but not my first choice in a war.-jams:this gun jams. Simple as that. The darts stick out and then the gun won't work.-accuracy:How do they expect you to aim this thing as you shoot it fast??????Overall,I think this gun is pathetic and is the last gun of that kind of Nerf I'm buying. Worst ever.Plain and simple."
3,Jams,"This gun jams easy, and doesn't take very many different kinds of rounds. That gets hectic in the heat of battle picking the right ones up."
5,fun stuff,"This thing is a blast. I bought one for myself and liked it so much, i got two more (one for my cousin and one for her husband). It can get mildly annoying to get surprised by someone wielding one of these, but it's all in good fun."
5,Awesome nerf gun!!,"I bought these for my finace for Valentine's day and so far I've had so much fun using them, I don't want to give them to him!! Easy to load, easy to shoot, soft nerf darts that stick. Lots of fun for all ages!"
5,It Does What it's Supposed to Do,"What more is there to say? It's a nerf gun. It's fun to shoot your friends, or the wall, or whatever, with foam darts.The gun has pretty good range, and power, but not enough to really hurt anyone, which is a good thing. The darts stick well to hard, flat surfaces. The gun is durable as well, and it's just plain fun.Simple yet fun, there isn't much more to say. I got it for my brother and he thinks it's awesome. Definitely worth the price.I'm giving it a 5/5, because I can't think of anything wrong with it."
5,Fun in the office,Great toy gun - Nerf outdid themselves this time. The darts fly really far both indoors and outside. The gun is durable - I have dropped in plenty of times with no issues. Make sure you buy some extra darts...this will also use the regular Nerf darts but NOT the whistling Nerf darts.
2,"For HvZ, a Terrible Choice of Gun","While a very entry level gun for Human's VS Zombie's it has many problems with it.This gun jams quite a bit. And when your trying to fight off a horde of ""zombies"" isn't a very good thing. Another problem is the Maverick is that its awkward when you have to reload it.While the gun is very easy to mod, and modding it does increase its usefulness, you would be better off spending the extra 10 or 20 bucks for a better gun.I'll be selling my gun for the next round of HvZ, and trading it in for two Tek 6's."
2,"Not much to say, neither time to do it","I will resume my experience with this gun using copy and paste from other buyers:This gun misfire. It is hard for my 6 YO son, he can barely pull back the spring loader. The barrel is jamming and not properly aligning the bullets with the firing hole, this gun needs to be cocked EVERY TIME before pulling the trigger. It does not fire 6 continuous rounds. He's not using it anymore. The fun lasted one month.Hasta la vista"
2,Broke after 2 months,"I would use it every once in a while and then it stopped working 90% of the time. Now when i try it, it shoots a blank."
4,Nerf gun,"Fun nerf gun. Bullets stick well to windows. After a year of use, sometimes a bullet jams, but is able to loosen and still use. Just frustrating for kids if happens too often. Able to take other nerf bullets, such as whistlers. Not able to rapid fire as need to recock after every shot."
5,awsome!,this toy is awsome for the price get it Im a a big nerf fan. Im a kid who really tests its abiity and strength it always is like I just took it out of the box its much bigger the it apears on the picture it is much larger then the night finder. over all this is the perfect hand gun to have in the rage of war. the onlything I do not like is that u have to re-load after 6 shots. no gun is perfect)I also like the recon-CS36 get this product you wont regret!!!!!!!!!!
5,Very Durable,"We have had lots of fun with these Nerf guns. We have bought them before and they are extremely durable. Even after being ""abused"" by my teenagers. We had to get extra guns so the whole neighborhood could get in the fray. Lots of fun!"
3,good toy,"The Nerf N-Strike Maverick a good gun for target shooting, and sneaking up on people when they have their back turned to you. You can stick different types of darts in the gun like Micro darts (suction darts that can stick to glass), Micro sonic darts (whistling darts), etc. The only problem is the gun jams 30% of the time. So it's best not to be in combat with the gun."
4,Awesome gun dude,this gun is pretty good. THe only problem is the durability. IT IS VERY EASY TO BREAK IF YOU GET MAD AT IT!!!!!!!! THis gun was not working for me because of a jammed bullet so I whacked it against a tree not too hard and it didn't fire well at all afterwords. Overall I give this gun a 4 outta 5.
2,"Fun, but not worth it.","The gun is fun because it creates a western cowboy feel, but it jams, holds only 6 rounds and is limited to nerf syle darts. a better choice is hyperfire blaster. Its easier to load, shots practically any dart you can find on the ground and has better range and accuracy. and it doesn't jam and gives you 10 shots. its easier to reload in combat, etc. If you are looking for a nice sidearm forget the magnum, get a hyperfire.The magnum is fun, but I baught my hyperfire to $6 more and its a much better weapon."
4,A Very Accurate Review,I reciently purchased this gun and ran a review.1. Shooting distance 20-30 feet2. Loading Medium Difficulty3. Duribility High4. Malfunction 10% out of 100% of the time5. Power Medium-High6. Shoot Reload Shoot Speed MediumThat was my review I hope It helped You!!!
2,Not too Great,"As a Humans vs Zombies player, I cannot advise the use of the Maverick. Get a Spectre or the newest pistol Nerf just put out. Mavericks tend to misfire, which is frustrating in a normal game of Nerf, and ""fatal"" in a game of HvZ. (Zombies are fun though!)"
4,"Accurate, Great grip, Rapid fire , Easy to reload","The title says it all. I love this Nerf dart blaster. My son tried several varieties of blasters at a recent birthday party and this one was a great balance of speed, accuracy, and thrust. The grip is also great for kids and adults. My kids all found the slide very easy to grip and pull back. The darts are universal and very cheap to replace."
2,Wasn't age appropriate .,My grandson is almost 6 years old.. but it was extremely hard for him to cock the Nerf N Strike. He could do it a couple times then needed assistance. (his Dad) I could not cock it !! Was amazed he could do it even the number of times he did !
5,Great Present for Almost all ages!,Looking for something inexpensive but a hit. This is what we gift to almost everyone and is life of the party for all ages.
4,nerf gun,good gun.. shoots hard and far. good to add to my sons collection. he plays with it everyday. sometimes gets jammed.
3,Not enough power,This gun is one of the ones I like the least in the Nerf line. It has less power and jams more than some of the others. On the good side it is portable.
2,"fun, but Dart Tag is better.","My 6 year old son received this as a Christmas gift. It's fun but the suction cups don't stick to the walls and it didn't come with any targets to shoot so the darts don't actually do anything once shot. He also received the Nerf Dart Tag Furyfire 2 Player Set which is much more fun because the darts are velcro and stick to clothes and the vests that came with it. I wish the darts were interchangeable with this gun. The dart tag darts can sometimes be used, but must be loaded very carefully to work. Fun concept but not as fun as the other Nerf systems."
3,this gun sucks get a nite-finder instead,This gun is alright on accuracy but it has no range compared to a nit-finder yeah it has the cool revolver 6 shot without reloding but it needs some adjustments. Oh and keep up the good work nerf you really did well on the nf it is the best pistol i've seen in years.Lets put it this way if your a newb in nerfing or just want to try something new get this but i would really suggest the nite-finder instead.
3,bad toy,This toy is not reliable. At first the gun is great and then it breaks. I am telling you do not waste your money on this stupid toy.
2,Don't buy!,"I got this toy at Target and when I got home and tried it out, it didn't shoot a far range."
1,poorly constructed,"the barrel in mine would fire once, rotate, but not fully. The second shot would hit the inside of the barrel and never exit. Further revolutions were off as well, it could never fire more than one shot. The barrel rotation was simply just off. Whether it was design or manufacturing defect, my opinion of NERF is totally shattered. I bought this for my nephew but decided to try it out myself first, glad i did, because it is embarrassingly nonfunctional as a revolver."
4,"Takes some Muscle to Prep to Shoot, But Fun","We bought this gun for my 4 year old son. It's lots of fun to shoot the tv or glass door (with someone standing behind it pretending to be shot), but it is difficult for a little guy to pull the handle back before each Nef dart is shot. I have to help him."
4,Suction tip refills for this gun,"This is a really fun gun. We drew a giant target on a black board and had fun taking turns and scoring the game. My problem began when my son broke one dart and accidently shot another into our very high chandelier. I went to buy refills and had an awful time finding them. They ARE on Amazon, but I found them accidentally. They are called: Nerf Action Blasters Refill Pack: 10 Micro Darts with Orange Suction Tips. There are several other ""micro dart"" products with very little description. I have received the ""orange suction tip"" product and they are the right ones for this gun!"
4,20 Yr old- next day review,"Very cool gun! I am 20 and I just horse around with my friends with it. The only problem is the barrel sometimes takes a bit to open/close. The closing problem is frustrating because you have to push the button to open AND close the barrel. This shoots very far, and does not hurt if it hits someone. It was only $10, and I think it's worth that value."
5,ever heard of an SBD?,"Silent But Deadly. This gun is the bomb! As one other reviewer said, the sweet spot in the nerf lineup, quote-on-quote. Pretty simplistic one-shot firing makes a very accurate shooter. The only three major problems are the popout mechanism, actual firing, and dart pushing-in. 1) Popout mechanism sometimes sticks in momentarily (this can get really annoying; should cure after a couple uses), 2) firing is offset because your hand moves because of firing the gun, and 3) If you don't push the darts all the way in, they clog the gun barrel. However, these are minor problems and you should have no problem! For eight-ten bucks, a great buy!"
4,Very Fun for indoor use,"I bought this gun mainly for it's looks and functionality when used indoors. It can shoot about 15 - 20 ft out of the box and can get about 30 - 35 ft if you want to modify it. It is a very durable toy, but if it does break, it will be the hammer pin that is used to prime the gun. The pin is held by plastic tabs that can wear down, but only from very heavy, heavy use. This gun has a high rate of fire but can misfire occasionally depending on the darts. The included darts are okay, but a bit too soft and thin. If you are able to find thicker darts, I would recommend it. The barrels are tapered so I would recommend not storing the darts in the barrel for a long period of time. And the color is the new yellow and black scheme, not the blue and silver as depicted."
2,Jam's alot,"It has become a Christmas tradition that each year we get all the kids (our own, nieces, nephews, and the uncles cuz let's face it- they're just big kids) Nerf guns and the whole family goes nuts after dinner. (I think the adults have more fun than the kids) This model has been the most disappointing. We thought it would be a great basic gun that the younger kids could use, and it is, except that it keeps jamming. We actually have several of this model (4 or 5 maybe) and they all jam up quite a bit. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,CHRISTMAS GIFT,Got this item for myself for christmas so me and my son can play nerf war toegther works great love it.
1,Brand New Maverick Nerf jammed,"This Nerf Maverick did not work since the first moment we used it.The barrel is jamming and not properly aligning the bulletts with the firing hole, causing misfire every other time.No user manual attached on how to solve this problem."
2,A REAL HIT AND MISS,I purchased two of these nerf guns for my five year old boy who was ecstatic the day the box arrived.The reason I ordered this particular item was because you can load six darts at one time (although you have to crank up each time) however I was very disappointed to watch my son become frustrated by the fact that the darts only shoot out now and then and not every time like they should. Upon my trying to shoot the darts I experienced the same issue. I think its a poor design and that you are better off with the single shot nerf gun unless you enjoy becoming very frustrated.
2,Nerf and Strike Maverick,My grandson got this for Christmas and it does not seem to work very well. You load the darts and they only shoot out some of the time which can be frustrating.
4,"Nice toy, son loves it",One of the better nerf guns due to its simplicity. Feeds well and shoots. What more can you ask for?
5,Perfect for Nerf gunslingers.,"Lots of fun for kids of all ages. You cock the slide once and pull the trigger to fire; 1 pump per shot fired, with an ammo capacity of 6 Nerf rounds. Solid construction, but it's still plastic with all the limitations thereof. It's a lot of fun to shoot, and with a little practice you can fire it very quickly and surprisingly accurately. Awesome intro to modern Nerf weaponry!"
5,"Good quality, fun",Bought 2 of these after being not so impressed with the non Nerf brand guns. These guns are well built and work much better than off brands. The only issue is you will wish they had more dart capisity.
4,Great Toy,I got this to have some fun while being deployed and it has definately raised my moral... We have had lots of fun shooting people with the wistle darts they work great. The only con is one of the bairels is messed up some how so it only shoots 5 rounds instead of 6 a definate buy along with the whistle darts
1,sucks sucks sucks sucks,this gun broke in two or less weeks! I only fired 6 rounds. if you ever get this gun send it back.I know quality when i see it as i am a long time nerfer my first gun was when i was 6. this gun just sucks!
5,A great choice,We have been happy with this Nerf gun that my son got a couple years ago. It is easy to load and easy to shoot. It has held up very well and we haven't had any problems with it at all.
3,Cool fun toy!,"This N-Strike Maverick REV-6 blaster is classic. Looks and works like a big revolver. Can do about 25 feet with suction darts using elite darts 35 feet.Playing it 'on' CRT(glass tube) tv is fun. Like old school Duck Hunt game. You can aim for various objects on tv., i,e. catcher's mitt during baseball game or two darts sticking over the news reporter's eyes, etc... I don't think CRT tv exists anymore what a shame.Overall a good toy."
4,I feel like a combination of the Terminator and Mad Max.,"Awesome design. My only real gripe is the range, which causes accuracy to fall off fast at anything over than 10 feet. Still, I've had one for over a year, and it's still going strong. I like it so much that I bought two more as gifts."
2,not up to expectations,I thought the Fuller name on a product meant quality. This time it means poor quality. The bristles fall out just as the one I took back to Target.
4,THIS ROCKS!,YOU MUST OWN THIS CD. SHATNER RAPPING IS FANTASTIC. THE OTHER TRACKS ARE GOOD TO. IF YOUR A STAR TREK FAN YOU MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM.
2,"Full of Stories, no real direction","The book teaches through others inspirational stories; there is no real teaching on how to have a positive attitude. I was expecting the book to give me steps on how to have a positive out look. It is also a religious book, which I didn't expect when I ordered it."
1,"Christian Based book.... lots of bible quotes, etc...","Wish I had seen a review like this before ordering...:Note: I received this book and started to read and discovered very early on that it is largely Christianity based, that there are lots of Bible quotes, and that it was not for me, so I did not finish the book. I was turned off by all the religious overtones (can't even call them undertones as they are so prominent).This book is for Christian people and those who like to be inspired by the Bible and passages from the Bible. I was looking for something else entirely and wish I had realized what I was getting before ordering. That being said, it is not very well written, and the ""anecdotes"" aren't all that believable in that they seem very simplistic (made up) and the advice or answers offered are direct Bible quotes...If that's what you're looking for, this book might be for you, if not, avoid."
1,Sent wrong book,"I was very dissatisfied with this item, because I never received it. I was sent a different book and have been trying to rectify the situation for almost a month.All I wanted was my Norman Vincent Peale book."
4,The Power of Positve Thinking (# Books),Excellent book. Even though it is dated in time references the information translates the same in todays environment. Uplifting and powerful.
4,enthusiastic about positive thinking!,I enjoyed reading these three books in one. The pages contain words of wisdom that I'm sure I will refer to all of my life. Therefore this book will never get old. It has a Christian flavor with the appeal of timeless wisdom.
4,Liked it!,"After the events at Sandy Hook, I found this to be a great insite to how familes, and communities try to heal."
4,A good read you look forward to coming home to,Diane Chamberlin keeps your interest and puts little surprises into the story. Her characters are people you can relate to and might even know. You could put yourself into the story. This is her second book I've read and will defintely read more of her works.
5,A book to lose yourself in,"Well blended characters, a story that keeps the reader drawn in with lots of twists and turns but a happy ending.."
4,Enjoyable story,"I enjoyed this book as the story line carries one along, just like other books by Diane Chambrlain. It has a sense of mystery and romance."
2,Not Her Best,I have read many of Ms. Chamberlains books and this one fell far short of her others. It was very slow and I almost gave up trying to read it. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that almost everyone in this book is married and all of them are unfaithful. I don.t like a book that gives the impression that marital infidelity is acceptable. Then on top of everything else laughed out loud at the ending. It was completely unrealistic.
2,Didn't like this one,"I have read every one of Diane Chamberlain books and she is my favorite author. I have found no other author to compare to her style, and really loved all her previous books (except Brass Ring). This one fell really short for me, it dragged, and was so predictable. I didn't care for the characters, and honesly, I finally gave up about 2/3 of the way through the book and just skimmed ahead to the end. Sorry Diane. I will buy your next book....please write in your ""old style"" - those were absolutely thrilling. Can't wait for the next book."
4,"Moving, many-layered story","This was a great book, with many-faceted characters and some surprises along the way. My only quibble is that the main character, Rachel Huber, still goes by her maiden name even though she has been married twice. Why doesn't she use her husband's name now? Other than this point, I enjoyed the book a great deal."
4,Entertaining.,"Rachel Huber fled her hometown of Reflection, Pa. twenty years ago after a tragic accident, but decides to return when her grandmother falls ill. Entertaining. As usual, Diane Chamberlain's books are a combination of romance, secrets, and suspense."
2,Very slow moving,I read Breaking the Silence and I loved it.So I bought Reflection and I really struggled to finish it.It was nothing like Breaking the Silence in style at all.I was very disappointed!
1,Agreed-SCAM,"I too got caught in the same trap. I am not sure what model they are for, but not what I ordered. Unfortunately it isn't worth the cost of shipping it back. Given what happened with the order, what's to say that I would actually get my money back if I did send it back. DO NOT ORDER THIS!"
1,Found the correct dust cup for the 18 volt.,Thanks for your comments that these dust cups were incorrect for your Shark handheld vacuum. I looked into Google. The dust cup for the 18volt vacuum are at the Shark/Official site...for $12.95 each! :(
5,great,"Awesome replacements. Work great, these allow my shark hand vac to run like new everytime and are nice to have."
4,As Expected,These came and were what I expected. Decent quality and will work with the system I currently have. Would order again.
4,A book for anyone living with bipolar disorder.,"Bipolar disorder is a potentially deadly affective disorder that is characterized by mood swings. Episodes of depression or mania punctuate the suffer's life, often destroying relationships, ruining careers, and in 15% of *untreated* cases ending in suicide. There is no single effective treatment for bipolar disorder, but with time and a good biopsychiatrist the illness can be brought under control.The Tormented Mind is an excellent book on the author's experiences with bipolar disorder, presented from the viewpoint of a well-educated Chinese-Canadian woman. Her account of hospitalization and the way the illness affected her family relationships will be familiar to all of us. I applaud Carolyn's accomplishment despite this disruptive illness, and highly recommend this book to anyone who is living with bipolar disorder."
5,Classic gangster rhymes,"I first heard of Point Blank when I purchased the No Limit compilation Down South Hustlers way back when i was in high school. It contained the song ""My Mind Went Blank - Screwed Version"" and was one of my favorite tracks on the album. It eventually led me to hear other DJ Screw compilations that had Point Blank songs on them, some of which are originally recorded on this album. Truely a must have for any fans of the Texas rap scene in the nineties. This album also has an appearance from UGK on a song."
3,Too Short A Stroll,"""Storybook Culture"" makes for a dismayingly short stroll down memory lane. While the book contains a whopping thirty examples of cover art from the Tom Swift books, too many other staples of kid lit are completely ignored. Some of these ommisions are shocking. They include Wesley Dennis' beautiful illustrations for ""King Of The Wind"" and other of Marguerite Henry's famous horse books, Tasha Tudor's art for ""A Little Princess"" and ""The Secret Garden,"" Maurice Sendak's ""Where The Wild Things Are"" and Pauline Baynes' memorable drawings for Lewis' Chronicles Of Narnia.These are just to name a few. Childhood is normally marked by a fascination with animals. Although the editors show a few examples of horse and dog illustrations and several covers from the Uncle Wiggly books the menagerie of beloved animal friend from A.A. Milne and Rudyard Kipling and others are missing in action.Berkeley Hunt"
4,Cubicle Christmas Tree,There's not much I can fit in a small cubicle. This is the perfect size and my co-workers comment on it all the time. They love watching the lights change.
4,Nice ornament for my office desk,"I purchased this for my desk at my office. It is simple to use, just put it on a USB port and that is it. It changes color and makes your desk Christmas spirit ready.The only two cons I found are: cable to short for my taste, base of the tree has no grip so it may slide easily over your desk, that is why the four stars only."
5,Computer Tree!,This was fun this christmas season as I was able to enjoy a tree in a very small space on my computer!just plug it into the usb of any computer and your christmas spirit will improve!
4,Good Christmas gift !,The little tree is as a very good christmas gift. Colors are radiant and show up well even in bright light.
3,might order again,"Ordered 2 of these tree's, one arrived in excellent condition and the other arrived with the star broken off. Do really like the tree, but only if it doesn't come broken."
4,Best game for E.T.'s Planet,"Great game for any E.T. fan. The only con is that the humans are not in it. Elliott, Gertie, and Michael are not in it. It is just about E.T. on his home planet going through each level as it gets harder and harder. I am 12 years old and I still haven't finished it. But it is very hillarious seeing E.T. run!"
4,E.T. - Terrific game for kids and adults alike!,This game is alot of fun and great for parents looking for non-violent games for their children. The graphics were good and the premise behind this game was good. The object is to help solve puzzles and different mission objectives by collecting rare plants and using special powers such as heart stun against alien enemies. Good game! I took off a star because of annoying dizzy camera angles and very slow loading.
3,I need stratedgy help,ET has been alot of fun so far. I am looking for a stratagy book to help me as I am stuck in part 4. Please advise if you can. Thanks
1,Warning!,"This game is an abomination that should be sought out and destroyed. The game is incredibly boring. The platforming and overall concept of it makes me want to vomit. I would rather eat a baby than play this game again. If you are an E.T Fan, and I mean die-hard fan, then you might enjoy this game. If you are not, you will probably wish the alien had died."
2,Pure stress....,"This is absolutely the most aggravating program I've ever used in my life. I have to use it for only one program that I have, an online postage program, which doesn't exist in the Mac world.I run a 1ghz flat panel Imac, a fairly speedy Mac. But running a Windows program in Virtual PC, it runs like a 100Mhz pc....it's pitiful. But, the only option for some Mac users that need to run Windows applications.Virtual Pc is a necessary evil, and I'm glad it exists....but geez, some work needs to be done on it."
1,Why did I even give this 1 star????,"The only thing I can say with regards of virtual pc is that the feeling of using it is no different than having $1,000,000.00 the other side of a window and not being able to open the window to get to it! Yes, it's that frustrating!"
5,GREAT PURCHASE,Great. As soon it came in the mail i put it in and it played right away. I was concerned when it didn't have a case but no worries SPOOOOOOON!
1,SPOOOOOOOOOOOOON!,"O.K. other than a few funny moments and some neat parts of the game. This game is kinda stupid, I have played it a few times and it is repetitive, impossibly long, and at times very boring. I had a friend who had this game and could actually beat it once on his emulator. There were a few cool bosses but thats it. And the ending can only make you say ""huh"" this game is a big POS."
4,Kick-A** Game,"Everyone cries; ""There's never been a good Superman game!"" Well this is it. It's the Doomsday storyline that sold all the books and was all over the national news when it was released BITD. You go through the whole campaign of Doomsday falling to Earth and all the incarnations of 'Big Blue' trying to defeat him. Superman even DIES early on in the game, and it still gives you tons of creative storyline and play. You play as Supes, The Eradicator, Steel, The Cyborg and the latter day Superboy, while you try to destroy or use(the Cyborg) Doomsay in Superman's absence/death. Now some of the villians do get repetitive, but it's not too big a deal once you get a feel for each one, you can have fun dispersing them in different ways. It's one of the cooler superhero games on here. Also check out Batman Forever for another good movie tie-in, another favorite."
1,Waste of time and money,sampled three glowsticks before the birthday party. All three had many ugly voids. One was dead for over a third of the length.And no connectors to make a circle or connect sticks; only defective glowsticks.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!
3,Glow Necklaces,"The kids had fun with these, but the plastic clasp kept splitting on these so the necklaces would not stay secured. This happened to about half of them."
3,Over all fun product,The clasps that holds them together are cheap and break... but the kids had fun.
1,Do not purchase!,In the most unfortunate of events we purchased multiple tubes of the Lumistick Brand glow necklaces and we were not able to use ANY of them. When you try to connect a necklace it pops right out from the connector. We thought ok this one cannister is defective but nope we tried all of them and not one good necklace came out of them. As a business it was the most embarrasing thing to have to put tape around a glow necklace that we had no choice but to use since it was all we had to sell. Sad to say the least!!!
1,GLOW NECKLACES,Very disappointed. Very DULL glow. NOT WORTH THE $$$. Will NEVER order these again.BUYER BEWARE---will order from a different company next year for our needs.
3,Dull glow make sure you buy in person so you know they are new.,"The glow sticks must have gotten damaged during shipping, that or they were really old. The sticks that did glow were dull and barely lit. We bought a pack of 50 for a festival and were annoyed they didn't work since it was crucial we were well lit at night. Make sure you buy yours in person so you can tell if the product is new and not damaged. When new these sticks glow brightly."
1,Very Unhappy,"The product came in a ripped open box, with pieces missing. When I asked to have the missing pieces replaced, I was told that the only thing I could do was to return the item for a refund which would take about four weeks, and I could place a new order if I wanted the product still. I can't reorder and get it before the 4th of July, so why bother! What I will do, is never order from your company again."
1,Very disapointed.,"Received item this afternoon.29 out of 50 lightsticks inspected in a dark room showed spots glowing which indicates the glass vial inside already broken. Since process already started, I lit up all 29 and inspite of all the shaking to mix the contents, only 1 glowed whole and rest only a third to half of its length.Manufacturer should have some cushion inside for protection and a printed date of manufacture or expiry will help and validate the ""factory fresh"" claim. Mine came with plastic wrapping that's already brittle which means old old old old old stock. Furthermore, Amazon.com could have done a better job of packing since order was fullfiled by them.0 star - 1 star is way too high a rating for this item."
1,Very dissatisfied customer,"About 50% of the Glow Sticks had already been activated and dead. Packaging was not enough to support these during transport so a lot of the sticks were DOA. If you only need 25 staicks out of the 50, go for it....if you need all 50 sticks, better order extra or order elswhere.-PaulTucson, AZ"
2,Glowstick....w/o much glow,"I should have taken the advice of a previous review. After opening up the package, about 20% of the sticks were already activated thus were useless. Almost all of the purple glowsticks were defective. This company needs to change the packaging they are using for shipping."
1,The Necklaces that never made it to the Dance,"I am very disapointed in Prettypartyplace. I ordered 300 glow necklaces for my HS Homecoming Dance and they never arrived. I was charged for the necklaces and when I tried to call the phone number it didn't work. Next I e-mailed them 3 seperate times, still with no response. I am now in the process of filing a claim with amazon which is still pending."
2,misleading information,"The necklaces are great but you will not get the number of necklaces that you think you are getting. Each necklace has a joiner which counts as a ""piece"". So you may get the impression that you get 50 necklaces, but in reality you only get 25."
1,Broken packaging and NO CONNECTORS,"I guess I should have read the reviews before buying this product, because it turns out that many others had the same problem I did. The tube the glowsticks shipped in was barely taped on the ends and they came loose and into the larger amazon box. In a dark room I can see that at least a dozen are already glowing, presumable because they got bent/cracked a bit during shipping. Lame!Even lamer, they didn't ship with connectors! How can they be 'necklaces' without connectors? This makes them simply long, skinny glowsticks."
1,They will arrive damaged and won't glow for you,"Because of the poor way that Amazon packs these, and the poorly secured ends on the tubes from the seller/manufacturer, you can expect to have the necklaces arrive loose in a box, all bent and activated and burned out."
1,What might have been.,"The sleek pillar of a box arrived stamped ""Amazon"" in a bold type. We all quickly gathered around to carefully unveil the contents. No silly paper wadding nor other buffers obscured the broken package of Glowsticks inside. Still dimly shining their dying glow, hopes of maniacal rave dances to come fled into the ether. Luckily, Amazon Prime returns rock, so at least the cash was not wasted. Seek elsewhere your neon delights oh brave soldier, this seller sucks too hard to yet deserve your cash."
1,You get what you pay for,The packaging was broken when we received the tube. Probably about 3/4 of the necklaces didn't light up completely or at all. We also didn't have enough connectors for all of the necklaces. Very dissapointing overall. Next time I'll spend the extra money on better quality necklaces.
2,"Beautiful, but seat is a problem.","This is a great looking bike, and my [...]was able to ride it right away. The only problem is that the seat is angle up at the front, so my son kept sliding off. The seat is shiny/slippery so that didn't help. It was really hard for him to stay on."
1,"No TC, no beginning, no links","That pretty much says it all. Ok, it's free. But it doesn't even tell you what's in there. Don't bother; other collections just aren't that expensive to make this worth it."
3,Garden Party,Mansfield's innovative diction captivates readers and draws one into her own world. A world in which individuals are not bound by the common restraints of society.
3,"Good Product, Bad Shipping.",This is a good product but next time I will buy at the local store because both times I have ordered liquid laundry supplies the UPS delivery was leaking and messy.
2,um,"this is a cool toy, but believe me, ZipZaps are 5000000000 times better. i am gonna stick to ZipZaps"
4,Just the size I needed. Nice light.,"Perfect size for my curio cabinet. Do NOT expect the sticky tape alone to hold it up! I found this out after it fell off. Fortunately, nothing was damaged. We then used the screws to hold it...perfect!"
3,Samsung CHT-420,"This unit could be a great second everything-box in a kid's rec room. I would reconsider using it as a main entertainment center, though. Some of the remote features do not work on all TV sets (mine is a Zenith), and this is stated in the manual. Other features work with CD, like A-B repeat, but not with a DVD. Sound quality is okay but there is a pretty distinct buzz from the left and right surround sound speakers. Also, the woofer is a little weak. Over all, maybe not the best main unit, but certainly a decent second unit for the money."
1,Why isn't 0 stars an option? This product is THAT BAD!,"Do not even think of buying this product. It is just no good. The driver supplied with it does not work very well with windows 2000. The driver software crashes at least once a day, and if you want to print again, you need to reboot your computer. The copier/scanner mechanism does not feed narrow items/small items very well. If you ever hope to scan something other than 8x11 plain paper, you're in for a surprise. This thing is junk, and the Lexmark support team is of no help whatsoever. The ""driver"" software problem noted above was mentioned to them, and they claim it is not a ""known issue"" nor will they assign it ""known issue"" status - yet many other folks are having the same problem. Just search the web for ""lexmark red diamond red x"" as the symptom is that the driver's ""red diamond"" symbol turns into a ""red x"" when the driver software has crashed. Goodbye Lexmark, hello HP."
1,Do not buy,"This printer is horrible. I have had this printer for about a year now and it CRASHES everyday!!!! I have to restart my computer to get something to print and it is a big hassle. Will not work properly with XP, even if i restart my computer and print an hour later, sometimes I have to unpug then replug the USB cord to get something to print. I am a college student so i bought this for the affordable price ..i guess you get what you pay for. WIsh I would have invested in a better product."
1,Incompatible with Windows XP,This all-in-one will not work with my Windows XP machine. The only thing it's go for is stand alone faxing.
1,Don't even think about it!,"DON'T BUY IT!!! This product is a junk. It doesn't feed smaller items through the scanner, the driver crashes a lot and it doesn't work with a B/W Cartridge only. The lexmark customer support is just awful."
3,exploring metaphysics,"Shirley Maclaine has proved herself not only to be a very good actress, but writer as well. She is very insightful and obviously intelligent. For those exploring the metaphysical realm, I would highly recommend her books."
3,The Making of a Film,"I didn't realize when I began this book that it was about the incidents that occurred during the filming of ""Out on a Limb"", Maclaine's other book. And I was glad that I had read her book ""Out on a Limb"" so that I would know exactly how the coincidences in the making of the film related to the book.Maclaine is a pioneer in the spiritual and metaphysical world. In this book she shares her spiritual discoveries by beginning to tell us of her belief that we all created our realities.She goes on to tell of her relationship and the kind of man Colin is. Colin worked with her on the screenplay for her book ""Out on a Limb"".Colin introduced her to Jack Pursel who channels Lazaris. I love how she addresses ""Should spiritual counselors receive remuneration?It was pretty interesting how she used real mediums in the film and the process of working with them as actors.The book seems more like a diary of events."
4,"Enjoyable folk music, well played and well recorded","In short, this is a good folk album free of any noticeable cons.IMHO this is the better of the two LPs. An improvement over their earlier work.I don't know the status of this group but hope they continue to evolve their sound."
4,Wanting More,"The documentary was absolutely amazing but unsatisfying because it stopped after 100 years. I don't know much about Chicago and only visited there once as a child but this certainly gave me a new appreciation of that city and desire to hear much, much more."
3,A tease?,"It felt like it was part of a larger series that was never completed. Things were really getting interesting when wham! Goodbye. The end. I was waiting for the black culture portion, then Capone and the politics of the 20th Century but alas...Also, I really can't stand those dramatic slow-motion recreations it has. It is a trend that always ruins a doc for me. Ken Burns never does that and seems to do just fine.See Ric Burns' (Ken's brother) ""New York"" for a perfect and masterful history of a city. It is superb."
3,Big,This is really my own fault. They arrived quite quickly but the stones are too big. There is no way they will be anything but huge cubic zirconia studs. Too big for me to wear but I haven't seen the company advertise anything smaller. I thought they would be 2 ct TOTAL weight like other establishments advertise but these appear to be 2 ct for each earring. My mistake I guess. I'll not be wearing them at any rate.
5,THE smt Textbook,"This is THE book, THE reference for surface mount techniques and managers.Complete and detalied. BUT... is getting old! fifteen years old (last editionin 1997)!!! It REALLY needs to be updated! Surely Mr. Prasad is thinking it over."
2,"Not very good, Just kind of drags on and on","I bought this game only beacuse it was on sale an it was probably a mistake. you can beat it in a few hours and there are better games out there for GBA that are first person shooters. Like ""Doom"" is a good one or ""Duke Nukem Advance."" These one are more exciting. Dark Arena has a good story line however you don't really get to participate in the main points of the game. i paid about $15.00 for it which is about how much it is worth."
2,Ew!,"I put down my Gameboy Advance half an hour ago, and I still have a serious headache from five minutes of playing Dark Arena. Don't get this game because it strains your eyes, the graphics [aren't good], and it gets a wee bit boring after a while. Okay, I gave it two stars because it does deserve some credit for being slightly fun for the first ten or fifteen minutes (just cuz i've never played the game before), but it does lose its edge. Don't buy this game. Save your money for something else--another video game (crash bandicoot or mario kart), a movie, clothes :O), or just for a rainy day!"
1,Dark Arena Review,"This game is -hands down- the worst FPS I have ever played. It's BackTrack all over again. The animation is choppy, the enemies are extremely easy to beat, and the pixely graphics are very uninspiring. If you sit down and play it, you can beat the whole game in under 2 hours. There is no challenge, even in hard mode. If you want a good FPS definately get Ecks vs. Sever."
2,Do NOT waste your money on this game!,"Dark Arena is the worst GameBoy Advanced game I've ever played. It's graphics are sorta okay for a first person GameBoy Advanced game, but the AI Script is terrible. The monsters don't chase you! Some parts are very confusing because of the graphics. Where the monsters are placed is really horrible, like they were firing something right in front of them when they try firin at you. There's a better game than this... Doom. Get that if you really want a first person shooter for GBA. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK!"
2,"Dark Arena, another DOOM clone . . . the difference?","Dark Arena is the ninth best FPS for the GBA, the first announced, but the fourth released for the system. Dark Arena is pretty much a Doom clone. What's the difference between the two? Well, hmmm . . . Doom is a better game. Dark Arena features enemies with zero intelligence which make them a breeze to kill even on the hardest skill level. The graphics in Dark Arena seem a little more bright and sharper than Doom but Doom looks better all around and is simply more fun to play. Dark Arena does offer a good variety of weapons, some neat looking enemies, and some fun levels but all of this is sub-par to the Doom games. Dark Arena is definitly a fun and welcome entry in the growing library of GBA games under the FPS genre but definitly a weaker one."
1,bad experience,"Ran the Windows XP nicely but was unable to connect to the internet from the Windows environment which was the whole reason that I bought this program.Tried everything on the support site on the internet.Spent over 3 hrs on hold and talking to people at Microsoft. As far as I can tell there is no one at Microsoft who provides virtual PC support. Whenever I was told that I was being connected to that ""group"" I was on hold until a nice person came on to tell me that everyone had gone home.so for me this was total waste of money."
1,Virtual PC does not work on the G5's,"Virtual PC in not supported by the G5. If you want to run dual operating systems, do not buy this product or the G5!"
4,Oh...God!,"All i can say is that i can't believe Devon's back. Devon Whitelaw! I mean that's pretty shocking because since the earthquack in SVH series, he's no where to be seen. So i thought that's it. End of story. And who knew he was such a coward. He never tried to save Liz in the earthquack.But now he's back like three years later. That's pretty cool. So i really hope in the next special diary edition, Elizabeth would meet the guy whom she's so obsessed with, Conner McDermott( my fav) which is in Senior Year. That will be so cool!"
3,Lets think?,"Ok. All i can say its a good book to pass some time. Its good to read, although its not up to date with the series and doesn't answer the questions about ""face it"" ,its good. If you just like reading about jessica you should still read it. To me the love stories seem like a past that never happened and in the end thay will never be aknowleged, so why is the author writing them i don't know. Maybe's she's in a slump trying to decide what happens next after the ""face it"" book, so she's just writing these stories for us so we can just pateintly wait for the suprise ending. Oh well. Read it if your bored."
2,What happened to Devon?,"This book should never have been written, its really unbelievable and WRECKS Devon's character! Devon was one of my favourite characters in SVH, but in this book he suddenly becomes horrible in a really unrealistic way. Not worth reading, although I wouldn't say that about all the Secret Love Diaries, Elizabeth's is pretty good."
3,Ok Storyline,"First of all this book was better than Elizabeth's Secret Love Diaries book. Although this book is good in the begining, when it heads towards the end it gets to be unbelivable, and the storyline starts to go downhill. I think that Jessica's Secret Love Diaries would have been better for the Sweet Vally Senior Year Series. I have a hard time believing that Jessica would do what she actually did in this book, and I really don't like the Secret Diary Books, and don't plan on reading anymore of them, because they aren't up to date on the current storylines with SVU, and the storylines are boring."
5,Navajo Sterling Silver/Turquoise Earrings,"These earrings are beautiful, great quality silver & turguoise, & look terrific with some of my other silver/turquoise jewelry; I love how they were made by an actual Navajo artist in New Mexico!"
5,Pleasently surpirised,Bigger than anticipated. Much nicer than its picture. I'm so glad I bought this.
4,"A good guide book, even if you're not retiring there!","This was actually a really help guide while traveling in Costa rica. Like the firtst reviewer, I also appreciated the Web link that keeps you abreast of changes in Costa Rica through frequent updates of the information in the book.Another Globe Pequot Press book I bought, ""Costa Rica: The Last Country The Gods Made,"" was helpful before I went. It's an essay-photo book on the country's various histories- political, geological, cultural -that would actually be VERY helpful for anyone considering working or retiring there."
2,Not Complete as We Thought,This guide seems to be far too subjective rather than factual . My husband and I found it to be incomplete in several key areas. It is not as detailed as several of the other guides on the subject. We have read them all since we live in Costa Rica.
3,A little underwhelmed,"Very pleased with the Amazon marketplace vendor and the fast shipping. A little underwhelmed with the product itself, however. Nice leather ... but the slots are just too small and require great effort to insert and remove a typical credit card. Also found that the zipper had a bad spot in it ... which I know wasn't apparent to the vendor because the product came in sealed packaging from the factory (Marshall).The case is usable for me if I turn all of the credit cards upright, but I'll likely keep on the lookout for something better."
3,Okay product for the money,"This is the second wallet that I've purchased from this company and while overall it's a good value, the zipper is very cheap and chintzy. The first one broke after about 8 months and the second one has the same type of zipper. If this one breaks in the same period of time, I'll not buy a third."
4,Wallet,"I love this wallet. There is plenty of space for all of my cards, cash, and all the other stuff I carry with me. The only complaint would be that when I first got the wallet the zipper tab broke off within 3 weeks. But I called belt outlet and they shipped another to me no questions asked. I even got to keep the one that broke."
2,Poorly made & not what I expected,"I was disappointed to see this wallet after reading the online reviews. Maybe I got something different. Maybe people have bad taste? Perhaps the photos in the product description are grainy for a reason.The leather (if it is leather) on the outside looks very fake. There's glue peaking out from under the seams. Stitching is poor and fraying on the inside. Worst of all, the pockets are made so tight that getting credit cards in and out is very difficult.I'm using the wallet to store extra credit cards I don't keep in my main wallet. The wallet will be out of sight, so I'll put up with the poor make. You get what you pay for. However, if you want a credit card wallet to use out in public, do not buy this one."
2,credit card slots,"credit cards are too difficult to insert & remove, especially for people with arthritis. had to return wallet for a refund."
1,THE ITEM I BOUGHT FROM LEXINGTON HANDBAGS,"I HAT THIS PRODUCT I BOUGHT FROM LEXINGTON HANDBAGS BECAUSE THE ITEM TORE ONLY LESS THEN A MONTH AFTER AND THE DAMN THING TORE. I CAN'T SEE WHY THIS HAPPEN TO ME AND I SENT INFORMATION TO ME I'LL NEVER NO BUT I WILL NOT, I MEAN I WILL NOT BUY FROM THEM AGAIN,.."
1,Hard To Use/Easy To Break,"Putting my cards in proved to be very difficult, the spaces just weren't big enough to fit a standard sized credit card when there was one above it. While putting one of the cards in, one of the seams ripped in one of the slots. Would not recommend."
3,Cheap material. But it dose its job.,"I was planning to use it as my every day wallet. Well... the cheap material just doesn't cut it. Now, I am keeping all my airline milage cards and my passport. Light. Good finishes."
3,NOT WITHOUT ITS PROBLEMS,"This could be a great credit card wallet, but it's not. The zipper is so tight it's almost impossible to open and shut without tugging when rounding the corners. The leather is cheap and the inside card slots/pockets are either cardboard or skimpy leather backed with cardboard. I am disappointed that this product which has excellent width (a passport easily slides into the inside pocket),many slots for credit cards, and a zipper that could have been a real help in securing contents, falls so short overall."
2,Poor quality,"The quality of this wallet is poor. I would not have bought it if I had a chance to touch it before buying. The zipper does not close smoothly; the leather looks just barely leather; it has a bad smell; glue is visible in some places; the finishing is rough. Generally the workmanship is of the lowest quality; I gave it 2 stars as it just might be the best you can get for this price, and because it fits all my cards."
4,Good Product,"I was in search for a card holder that would hold more than 10 credit cards. Not that I have 10 cc's but I have a zillion other cards such as video rental, insurance, hotel frequent visit cards, etc. I like this cc holder and glad I have purchased it. Just a few notes: The pockets are stiff and it's a little tough to pull a card out, but I'm hoping with it being leather, it will loosen over time and be easier to access. The zipper works well too, unlike another opinion I read online. Being a female, I like that my purse is not 'lop sided' where this is more longated checkbook-like, those other card holders are only the size of the cards and cause abnormal space issues in my purse. - I'm happy with the product"
1,Zippered Long Credit Card Wallet (Black),Product is terrible. The slots are to narrow to actually fit a credit card. I have no idea why the designers didn't measure first.
1,Very low quality,"This wallet is poorly made. First, there is a lot of discolouration, white spots both on the outside and the inside of the wallet. Second, the stitching is poor quality, and unraveling."
3,Lots of room for credit cards,"There is plenty of card slots in this wallet. The drawback is that the slots are very tight & the driver's license window is difficult when removing your ID. Trying to get my cards out of the slots for purchases has proven a bit difficult and I do not have long fingernails. If you do have long fingernails, this is not the wallet for you. It will take a struggle to get the cards and out you will mostlikely break your fingernails doing so(speaking from past experience). Some of the slots on the wallet have already torn, but I still like it. Would be nice if it had a change purse built in, but that's not so."
4,Zippered credit card wallet,"Enough capacity without being overly large. Stylish, but not overly so for a man. The only suggestion would be a mid- flap for additional identification card holder."
3,"Not a great product, not very delighted","I have been looking for a credit card holder for a long time. My requirement was to keep large no. of cards. I had lot of expectations with this product after viewing in Amazon but when I got it, I did not feel very delighted. The major problem with this product is that the slots to keep cards are not spacious. The cards have to be inserted and taken out with a large effort. The over all size of the holder is also small. The slot size could have been made a little bigger. The leather and manufacturing quality is good. Overall, the product is okay but not very good."
4,You get what you pay for.,"The consensus is accurate: this is a decent wallet for the money paid. It is leather, but as other reviewers have noted, it looks like it's seen better days. Still, my husband will be happy to have a zippered case in which to keep all the ""store cards"" currently junking up his glove compartment. Great find for the money/purpose."
3,Its not the best wallet in the world,"I know what I was getting into, so its not like I expected something great. The quality of product is just about average, smells funny when you take it out of the package. Also, the card holders are a little too tight for the credit cards. This could be because its new and the slots stretch over time. Is it worth $16? Depends on how badly you want a wallet. My credit card situation was out of control and I was moving, so I needed something fast. If you have time on your hands, look for something better. I was relieved to discover the zipper works fine without any problems.I would hesitate to recommend this product. That being said, its not terrible."
3,Credit Card Wallet,The wallet is a good credit card holder but it has some not finished or glued material left in some of the pockets [especially in the window slot] that make it hard to get your drivers licence and cards out.
4,Great Product,"Very nice leather Wallet, size is very good only little problem is the space is little tie it to insert cards, love the zipper for security."
1,Disappointed,"Having purchased these in the past with success, we were disappointed with the latest box. The chips were stale. More importantly, there was no expiration date on the bags which we were under the impression was mandatory."
4,A depressingly insightful read,"Reading Dr. Skolnik's adventures in an inner city medical office is similar to experiencing the levels of Dante's Hell. Just when you think you've read the most pathetic scenario, a more brutally depressing case presents itself.This was a very touching book, but it was much too brief. I'm sure Dr. Skolnik had more tales to tell, but perhaps he felt as if they might have become redundant. Still, I wish he would have added a few more chapters.The author's descriptions of his own emotions adds yet another fine layer to this book. However, I would have liked to read more about how, if at all, his work at the center affected his personal life with his family.All in all, this is a fine book that is well worth the effort to read."
5,Gorgeous listening,"Ordinarily I cringe when I get a CD filled with ""arrangements"" of music, great or less great. My reasoning is that a composer knew what he was doing in the creative process and who is so-and-so to alter it? <Russian Soul> on the other hand proved so beautiful at first hearing that all my prejudices went out the window. Here are 13 tracks of Russian music by Gliere, Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and other lesser known composers (including ""Folk""), played with melancholy love by violinist Cerovsek. This Delos release is highly recommended not only for its playing but especially for the selections, some of which I do not think are available on any other recording."
5,Excellent Saw!,"This is a great hand pull saw and for the money I don't think it can be beat.There are a number of cheaper options out there in the homes stores and online. The ones I am familiar with have cheap plastic handles and tend to retail for the same price of this saw but do not come with a case or an extra blade.The blade locking mechanism is secure and once I played around with it for a few minutes I was able to understand how to replace the blade quickly enough. The wrap on this handle is comfortable and looks to be durable.I was able to cut the legs from a set of end tables down to a shorter length quickly, cleanly and accurately with a few precise pulls for each leg.I am very pleased with this purchase."
1,NOT A COMPLETE EN VOGUE COLLECTION,If you are looking for a complete collection of your favorite En Vogue hits this is not a album to get other than the Very Best Of En Vogue because it has some minor hits and misses. Notably Missing is Riddle Hooked on your love and their cover of The Beatles Yesterday. And of course the theme from the short-lived Fox sitcom Roc is terribly missing too and why can't I find it on any En Vogue album? To me the theme from Roc {oops my name too} is the first tv theme that En Vogue was actually stars of singing themes of tv that actually made them famous. The last hit missing is Silent Night in which the only place to get this holiday hit is on the remix to sing album. But other than those complaints get the chance to wait for a better En Vogue collection
3,The Beginning Of Girl Power,"Most female R&B; groups really had trouble spreading their wings. But, when En Vogue came alnog in the late 80's, everything was changed.Their hot and sassy style has made them one of the hottest groups around. Their 1998 Best Of En Vogue collection, consists of songs that made them the female Supremes of the 90's. Songs like My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It), Don't Let Go, and Whatever are still played with all the feel and soul as it was back in the early 90's.Surprisingly, when Dawn Robinson left En Vogue in 1997 for Lucy Pearl and her solo career, the group slipped away slowly, in place of groups like Spice Girls and Destiny's Child. Nonetheless, the girls still had plenty of soul for the taking with this collection, and Masterpiece Theatre.Although they aren't played that much on R&B; stations across the country anymore, En Vogue never seems to go away, and that is true Girl Power."
3,THERE'S SUCH A THING AS TOO MUCH OF THE BEST OF...,"En Vogue is a group that I kept telling myself I would finally pick up when they came out with a greatest hits package. Well, they finally did, so I finally did. The problem with this cd isn't that it excludes anything I was looking for; indeed it has all of the radio cuts I'm familiar with. The problem isn't even the songs that I had never heard before, as they are all good as well; especially the sensational Lies. The problem is those last few hidden tracks! Almost half of this 74+ minutes of music is the last 3 remixes that appear at the end of the cd in the form of hidden tracks. Not only weren't they neccessary, but if you're not on the dance floor, they're totally out of place. Take my advise and buy the cd, but turn it off after track #14."
1,The Best of En Vogue,"Cannot give this CD a good review because it was so scatched it repeated the same song. The seller did refund my money, which I did not request but did get an email about ""you got your order, what else can I do for your?"" Thanks, Mary A. Mooney"
1,Just download free charts from NOAA,"Video panning across Virgin Island marine charts. Occasional pans across what looks like postcard photos and rarely some actual video clips of VI....probably stock footage. The limited value of the skipper suggestions as to navigating thru VI could be better gleaned from a chart book. Furthermore, even then it was difficult to tell what the commentator was talking about unless you were already familiar with VI. Video rarely used any graphic pointer or highlighter to draw your attention to the relevant spot on the chart during the narrative. Better title would have been ""Reviewing a Chart of Virgin Islands Without Pointing at it"""
2,haynes lightweight information,"I found the information for a 1988 Jeep Cherokee to be vague, superficial, and many times, incorrect. This might be due to production changes in the 1988 year. In looking for information on automatic transmissions, ignition system, engine control computer, or transfer case dissasembly or repair, the book says that this is beyond the home mechanic. Well, few other repairs even require a book for anyone with reasonable experience. I believe they are copping out. It was not worth reading."
2,1984 Jeep Grand Wagoneer,I bought this book so as to diagnose a problem with my transmission & torque converter. I found it to be pretty much useless. The pictures didn't show what I needed to see; the wiring diagrams weren't for the right year; the vacuum line diagrams for the vacuum lines that operate the hardware that actually puts the vehicle into 4wd were non-existent. If your jeep is stuck at the bottom of a hill somewhere due to the front drive line ripping the wires off the connector that goes to the neutral switch & back up lights don't look to this manual for help!
3,need more info on contents,would like to buy the book IF it includes a wiring diagram for the power rearview mirror wiring harness. I took it apart and can't figure out the correct places for the different colored wires.
1,This is a yo-yo item!,"What is Amazon doing? The price for this last week was $22.99. Yesterday it was $28.99 and TODAY it is $32! When I noticed that I finally read the comments, which I should have done before ordering and found out this is a poor quality set. What a rip off! Avoid this and Amazon's price yo-yo. Over the past week the prices have zoomed up on many media items."
2,3 BR pack-Alven and the Chipmunks/Ice Age/Ice Age 2,"Initially Picture quality and sound both were excellent. After a few months, there is no sound while playing the BR CDs. Picture quality is still the same without sound."
1,One BD doesnt Work,"The Alvin and the Chipmunk blue ray does not play. It doesnt work...I tried playing it with my PS3 or the regular blue ray palyer and for whatever reason, it does not play. I dont want to spend the time returning it and trying to eat up my time going back and forth."
1,Blu-ray rip off,"Frankly I couldn't care less about digital versions or a DVD version of any Blu-ray movie I buy, this is a typical Blu-ray rip-off. Do not buy this on Blu-ray!!! Save a few pennies and buy the DVD version."
2,It's Blu-ray lite....,"Wow a 3 pack of blu-ray for a little over twenty bucks. What a deal...right? Hold on the picture quality doesn't seem to be very good. What's this? Video is AVC 16Mbps ??? What does that mean? Let me see my Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaur Blu-ray. Hmmm, Video is AVC 32Mbps. Well that's no good. I don't know why they did this but these 3 pack blu-ray aren't the same as the normal blu-ray. Tho they come in individual blu-ray cases. They are the watered down version. They don't come with digital copy and they are only half of the normal resolution. The sound is DTS-HD and they do contain the normal amount of secondary audio. Only thing that made me mad is if I had wanted a watered down version I would have stayed with my upconverted DVD version which is basically what this is."
4,coffwee survival kit,"The ibek was not good quality, rusted after less than a week. but all in all it was a fun coffee experience"
5,We Don't Need a Bigger Boat!,"I have my McFarlane ""Orca"" sitting atop my computer monitor at work. I LOVE IT. We Don't need a bigger boat! This boat is tremendous. It fits perfectly across the top of my computer monitor. Beautiful workmanship in this model, so many details. I have the little ""Quint"" in the sharks mouth. It's fun to watch the surprised look on peoples faces when they come in to my office. As an artist, I can ""get away with it"". I totally suggest getting one of these for the fisherman in your life! I only have one question. Where is ""Brody"" and ""Hooper""? They get eaten? A little tenderizing, and down ya go! McFarlane, you did it again...great stuff!"
5,has everything,"one of the best toys on the market. as all mcfarlane toys, it is very detailed... Will be a sell out."
5,Great book for a Bible Study or devotional,This book beautifully illustrates how important the Body of Christ is to our Heavenly Father. As you ponder the words written on each page your perceptions are changed forever! A MUST READ!!!!
4,Good price for a good product,"Overall, I am happy with this purchase. The price was right, especially compared to what I would have paid had I bought it from my dentist. Though there is no warranty as purchased, I still feel it is a good deal considering what I had read about problems people were having with warranties on dentist-purchased units, which cost about 50% more.Although there was initially a problem with the accessories that arrived with the product, Amazon promptly remedied the situation to my complete satisfaction. I feel confident that Amazon will always make things right when there is a legitimate issue with a product they sell, and that's whyI did not hesitate to also buy one for my elderly handicapped mother."
2,"very upsetting, not for the weak of stomach (like me)","This movie is not for the squeamish. If you enjoy tough scenes of violence, sexual abuse of minors and a cast of throughly evil characters, this may be right up your alley.But, if like me, you find such things upsetting, stay away.The movie concerns a London pimp who is asked by a client to find a young girl. With the help of an experienced prostitute, they find a young 11-year-old runaway. Violence ensues and the younger woman and the girl are on the run.I have to say I didn't watch this all the way through. After about 45 minutes, I found the whole thing too upsetting to continue. This was not my idea of entertainment. I admit it, I'm a wimp. Others may enjoy this kind of stuff (all power to them) but if you're like me, be warned."
3,not good enough,"good points, no music, bad points, dubbed over as in recordings overlapped and repeated, no stand out passages of sound. so looks like you have fooled a few but not me, listenable. check out my five star reveiws on amazon"
4,"Works well for what it is, but its not the best for voice recording","I bought this affordable headset to record voice overs for some Youtube videos I was making on my pc. After listening to my recordings, I noticed quite a few, albeit minor microphone ""splosive"" pops. These pops were minor and would not be an issue for phone calls or pc gaming, but for voice recording purposes you'll want a better recording microphone."
3,"Add bbq sauce to eat these, then some flavor and less oily taste","My first sardines from here, and I thought they were very good after my disgusting experience with an eastern seaboard brand, all mushy. Then I tried the Crown Prince ones here, and these Season ones fell in rank, as mushy and flavorless and oily. I feel sure sardines do not come out of the ocean this soft. Still have some of the Season left and eat them merely as a health food, like nasty medicine so good for you. But eat after slathering with a tablespoon of barbecue sauce, and maybe good cornchips on the side."
1,DO NOT BE FOOLED,"This is not the NOMAD unit, it is only a powerpack, do not be fooled by a gamer, he is a lying cheat""Optional Nomad playing peripherals include an AC adapter to save battery power, a cable for plug-in television play, a rechargeable battery pack called the Nomad PowerBack which allows game play time up to 3 hours, and a car adapter for continuous game play while on road trips."""
5,The real hand held system.,"I just have to say that the Nomad is 1,000 times better than any gameboy (why) because you don't have to sit under a light and worry about a glare on the screen,also the gameboy's screen is half the size of the Nomad and the gameboys sound is way too quite the reason that the Nomad did not sell very well is because Sega realeased it to late they did it when all the 32-bit systems were coming out. If your going to buy a real hand held system buy a Game-Gear or the Nomad,don't cramp up your hands with a gameboy.I have had many problems with my gameboy,sometimes when I turn it on it will say gameboy on the screen and then it will freeze,So the Nomad is not the only one that does that you'll most likely get that on ANY system and that usually means that it's time to clean it or make sure the cartridge is in all the way if you go gameboy your missing out on the better system (THE NOMAD)."
5,Hardcore Fans Only,"This is strictly for dub heads, nothing but dub, dub dub dub. Great Dub. Light up the spliff and play this put it on repeat youll learn a lil sumthin bout reggae music. Buy It cheap folks dont get scammed by these inflated prices on reggae music."
5,Awesome,"I have a 6 year old who is currently in the 1st grade and a 4 year old, they both love this game and I don't mind them playing because its educational."
1,Doesn't work with an upgraded Mac,This was a total waste. Says it works with Mac Os X and higher not true. Does not work with leopard. Tried to use it through Windows on my Mac and still didn't work well. Couldn't return it without fees.
4,Good basics for beginners,"Definitely has some important basics that beginners need, as well as plenty of information beyond beginner phase."
1,There is nothing complete about this book.,"The most complete book of History of Costume I have found is ""Survey of Historic Costume"" by Phyllis Tortora and Keith Eubank. The title of this book ""The Complete..."" and the lack of content simple don't belong together.This book is a beginners basic introduction to costume. It needs to be reviewed and mistakes need to be fixed."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"My daughter received a mix stick for Christmas as a gift and it completely stopped working in May. I called Disney and was informed they would replace it but I had to pay $30.00 for the new one. I would expect a $50.00 product to last more than 4 months...furthermore, Disney can certainly afford better customer service. I will not buy this product again!"
1,What a joke!,"Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and can't even get it to play. It said I could put her own music on it--yet I keep getting an ""unsupported"" message when I try to use their software. Thought maybe it was my computer so I used my husbands. He got a ""fatal error"" so the software won't install on his computer at all. Had I know I could ONLY use their mix clips, I wouldn't have wasted my money. Tried to contact the manf. customer service--no response. Would send it back, but can't find my receipt. Save your money and purchase an inexpensive mp3."
3,movielover,"The product I received is slightly different than pictured. It does not have the stackable beds, instead it has princesses to move around and die-cut out beds to collect. A little disappointed. Thought my 4 year old daughter would enjoy stacking the beds but this will do."
4,the RIGHT adaptor for the right price,when buying a sega adaptor make sure it has the SAME MODEL NUMBER as the genesis system you are plugging in to. (model 1 = adaptor 1602) (model 2 = adaptor 2103) (model 3 = adaptor 1479)
3,Misleading,While I have not used this product yet and I'm sure it will perform fine I feel I must inform other potential buyers the details are misleading in that it is stated it is an official Sega AC adapter. I ordered 2 but when they arrived they were both 3rd party adapters.
4,Finally found some use for W,"We have bought several of these super tough dog toys and loved them all. They hold up great to tons of abuse. The George W Bush toy was particularly well stuffed, I was surprised the little guy didn't break his seams. My dog loved it though because it was better to chew on. This overstuffing did interfere a bit with the squeaker. It squeaked but not all that loud. I really didn't mind. He was quite a bit smaller than I expected, and that will teach me to look at the size before ordering.And best of all I got to throw George around and watch my dogs chew on his cowboy boots. Always good for a chuckle."
2,This game is o.k.,"It's not the worst game I ever played.It was boring and the music could have been better for a Genesis game.It seemed like a regular game,pick up power ups and get through bad guys.I don't have much else to say as I only got to level two and then turned it off cause it was so lousy."
4,Doesn't sink into idle speculation,"This is a very good book about the Fitzgerald wreck. However, two things I wish the author had done:1. Get off his soapbox about the deficiencies in the Coast Guard Rescue services in lake Superior. I think it needed mentioning, but not in the detail he chose. He also ignores the Canadian rescue facilities.2. Label the photographs instead of making the reader refer to other pages to determine what they are looking at.Otherwise, the book is excellent and was well worth the money."
4,The Legend Lives On!,"I remember hearing about the Fitzgerald when I was a kid going through the Soo Locks tour and was always curious about the details. This book does a good job reveiwing the loss of the Fitzgerald and provides a lot of info on the possible causes for the wreckage. To this day there's no single concrete explantion for why it went down. While the author has a definite opinion on what most likely happened he does a good presenting all the possible theories and suggesting why they do or do not make sense. A good book, I'd recommend it."
5,Good Case,"Sturdy, very well build and aesthetically good looking item. The customizable foam is very handy, and this case is well suited for much more than just cameras."
3,Incompatable with Mac OS 8,"I got the book all excited and working with the Pantone color web system, but the next day I upgraded my computer to Mac OS 8 only to find out I made a very expensive mistake. The Pantone software isn't compatable with OS 8. However on the upside, I still have the book, and the Mac OS comes with a free HTML color picker which is actualy a bit better. At the $65.00 price tag you might be better off spending the extra $25 and buying the next Mac OS"
4,*says something nifty and witty*,"Short and sweet. This band is as heavy as it gets. At times they will get you with speed and technical precision. Other times they will get you with a straight ahead plodding, pounding in-your-face brutality. And other times they will throw you into a frenzy with some of the best moshes you've ever heard. Any way you slice it, they're gonna get you. Gojira has everything. Speed, talent and creativity. Plus, they're as heavy as it gets. Their lyrics are surprisingly uplifting and introspective. A breath of fresh air when compared to the gloom and doom of most bands in their ""genre"". If you like your music heavy and original, you'll love Gojira."
3,"Too technical, from British point of View","This book had great visuals, but the writing just did not flow. I love learning about the Revolutionary War, but found myself bored with what was written. The book was quite brief so even though some points were tedious, it was a quick read."
4,Worth Watching,"There is enough here to learn to justify a purchase. All carburetor service is done with the carburetor on the bike, so carburetor detail is lacking. The ""real world"" tuning and testing is the best feature."
1,Quality lacking,"The polarization is great, loved the pictures when the product worked. Used it on a shoot location for 3 days when it came apart and will not stay together. Photography is my living and the lense was not abused! Contacted the seller thru email and very disappointed in feedback. Got a two word response like English was a bad second language. Issue still not resolved. Go for a higher quality than Hoya when selected a polarizer lense. It's worth the extra money!"
2,If you're going to spend money...,"... then go ahead and spend it on something not so cheesy. I agree with the other reviewers. The cir-polarizer works great when it works, but the way this filter is constructed is faulty. I too unscrewed the filter and had it fall apart on me.I wish I had spent just a little more and gone with s Singh-Ray or something. Now I'm just out the $70 dollars I spent on this thing. I could not in good conscience recommend this product."
1,Fell apart,"Do not get this. Wow, for the price, you figured you can get a few years of use. I used this three times, shooting scenery and it fell apart on me. What a useless POS."
4,"""Life"" cant get much better!",My kids 8 and 10 really enjoy it. Even with friends they all gather around the computer and play. A game does not take that long around 1 hour or less. Lots of fun for all!
3,"Good, but not great","I loved the American Whose Line, and even though I also love British comedy, this show often falls short of greatness. Compared to the American show, it moves pretty slowly, and offers little variety. They just do the same ""games"" every week, and some of them aren't that great. They did have some wonderful guest stars, but some were equally bad. Definitely worth watching if you're a BritCom fan or a Whose Line fan, but it won't exactly change your life."
2,disappointing product,I've enjoyed seeing the English version of WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY? and prepared to see a mix of English and American improvisers. Not so! I recognized a couple of players but the rest were disappointing and not very funny. I would have exchanged for later seasons but the seller was not willing to do so. I've come to trust the items I buy from Amazon and their dealers but this one has me thinking twice before I buy other items.
2,Did not star the people on the cover...,"Was ""ok"" but not what I remembered of Whose Line is it Anyway... Did NOT star any of the regular, recognizable, members, and was only marginally funny. Will wait with great anticipation for the remainder of the CD's that DO have the right actors. :)"
2,It's ok.,If you're a huge fan of the American version like me and started watching the American Version before the British like me then its a very good chance that you won't enjoy the British Version as much as the American. I have to admit I didn't really enjoy it at the least until Greg and Ryan had their bits. Some of the other comedians were funny from time to time but I really enjoyed the American version a lot more. A lot of people reviewing claimed the British Version is way better which is why I bought it but...ehh I'll have to strongly disagree.
3,Clearly the beginning stage....,"Almost all great shows take a few seasons to really get rolling, and Whose Line is no exception. The British Version of the show is by far superior to the American Version, but you really can't tell from the first two seasons. I'm not sure how the sales for this set have been, but I hope that A&E; will release the later seasons of the British Version, which leave the first two seasons in the dust.Some good moments, but the show clearly isn't in its prime with this set."
2,Whose Line Is It Anyway (British 1st season),"The performances in the first season and pilot were lame. I LOVE this series, and the subsequent seasons are fantastic. It just got off to a shaky start. It's a miracle the show lasted, as bad as the pilot was. When it's funny, though, it's hilarious!"
2,"Sorry to Say, Not as Funny as the American Version","Cheap, yes. Funny, no. And don't be misled by pictures of Greg Proops and Ryan Stiles on the cover - they appear in very few episodes, and only near the very end of the set. I bought this curious to see the origins of the familiar Drew Carey version of ""Whose Line?"" - which this set delivered - but ended up mostly bored and disappointed. There's a reason most of these early British improv performers didn't show up on the American show. Yes, I'm a Python fan. But this set left me shaking my head. ""Cruel but fair."""
2,Not The Complete Season,"I was so excited to find the British series and wholly disappointed when I discovered that ""The Complete Seasons 1 & 2"" were not at all complete. They only show a montage of scenes from Season 2 on the last disk of the set. If you're someone who likes to get their moneys worth, don't buy this product."
1,Excellent Product -horrible customer service,"The product is excellent. A little big for a purse, but it still will work if you don't mind pulling out something the size of a small paperback. The company, however, is horrible to deal with on any returns. They will go out of their way to not be helpful, will not return phone calls or email requests. If yu have to return something, it's recommended you go thru Amazon to assist you or you will receive NO customer service."
4,Fierce pierce,One of many fabulous compilations from the unchallenged tango master is a consistently ravishing articulation of the underutilized compositional structures this passionate form of music entails.
3,"adorable, but not worth the high price","Don't get me wrong, this mobile is adorable with the little bunnies wearing crocheted dresses, but other than that, the quality is not worth paying $50.00. Luckily, I did not pay full price for this item, and I would have been really disappointed if I had."
1,no sound or anything,"I plugged the device in and my computer immediately downloaded the drivers it needed, which seemed promising. Then I plugged in my simple earbuds and the device would immediately turn off and produce no noise. Complete waste of money."
1,piece of crap,"all this thing does is heat up my headphones for some reason and deliver inconsistent sound quality, not worth the 3 dollars"
2,It works..... but breaks easly,"Iv gone through 2 of these already, both of which have broke, only lasting 1-4 weeks. The plastic casing around it just snaps under the slightest pressure. I was using this for an analog gaming headset that had the 2 1/8th inch jacks. It worked well for a while but I kept having to glue the plastic covering back together. Even though the price is good..... the quality is not."
1,cheap but also nasty,"I can't complain about the price of the product, but sadly the connections are very poor, could only get it to work by constant turning and wiggling of the mic jack, in the end gave up and went to Maplins to buy a more expensive but much better quality sound card adapter."
1,External 5.1 USB 3D Audio Sound Card Adapter,EXTREME DISTORTED SOUND-AWFUL NOISE ONLY-WILL TRASH IT. Looked new-no visible damage-just defective unit. Tried in 3 newer desktops-JUNK. Replugged my speakers into PCs' headphone jacks as were without USB adapter & sound not distorted. Won't waste more time contacting seller (time & cost to return not worth a replacement).
2,booo!,It broke.The sound port in my laptop suddenly stopped working so I sought a cheap way to fix it. A decent one of these things cost about $40.00 so I thought I would try to see if this would work for me. It only worked for about a week before the quality just completely died and its pretty much useless now.
4,USB mini jack sound card review,"The USB sound card for use with mini jacks works fine except that on CQ100 VOIP Ham rdio operation the signal meter will not swing and read accuratly for some reason. Proper set up with the sound card eliminated the S meter problem!Other than that, it works fine!"
1,Don't Buy,I am simply going to say that this audio device for the computer worked well until I realized that it was made of cheap plastic. I had it for about a week before I set my laptop on the couch and got up and sat down and the device broke. I wouldn't even give this a star but I can't go any lower. Don't BUY!
1,Horrible Device,"I've used several devices of this style and this was the worst. The sound quality was horrible. I tried using it with Skype and the person on the line said that they couldn't hear me and the feed back of what I was hearing was really bad. Don't waste your money pay the extra and getSyba SD-CM-UAUD USB Stereo Audio Adapter, C-Media Chipset, RoHS. It costs more but it's well worth the money because the sound quality is excellent and it has a well made feel unlike this that feels like it's just thrown together."
1,Not worth it,"Static on both playback and recording. Noticeably loud and bothersome. I am by no means a sound expert, but go ahead and spend more money for a higher grade USB jack and you won't regret it."
1,horrid,"it didnt work, it didnt come with instructions. and futhermore when I held it gently, it came a part. dont get it. even if its a penny dont get it."
1,disliked,this devices became very hot while in use. It also made my headphones hot as well. yeah so i wouldn't recommend this.
3,great price but not really performing,i bought that for my laptop and is too big and doesn't work really good because if you have a microfone and a button as the ipod earphones those two are not going to work.
3,Good,"Works great for what I need, the sound is good, and no issues to install on the computer. Just the plastic is not so good."
2,works but cheap,This is a cheap throw away item. Case fell apart and fits USB loosely. I recommend the $6 one. it fits much more securly and doesnt feel so cheap
4,Very Good for the price,i recently broke my laptop headphone jack :'(and dont have the money right now to repair it soo i decided to buy one of these to give it a tryand i must say its got a really clean sound and if you're one of the persons like me that listens to lots of songs with bass on them this usb audio card has good sound and bass.ComplaintsIts toooooo loud and i mean it!Its soo loud that when im watching a video on youtube i have to end up lowering the volume down to like a little tiny bit.apart from that ^i think this is a really great buy and its cheap soo thumbs up :)
1,don't buy it,We used it once and then it broke.. it's cheap so I guess I could have known it?? I will not recommend it to other people
3,booooo,i use this card for djing and it works great but the sound quality is terrible. and it broke after 1 month of use. but for 2 dollars i bought it again!!!it fine but it sound baaaaaaaaaaaaad. for cueing with djing its just fine but i will upgrade later.
3,"Ugly, but works","I broke my audio jack, so I've been using this since I haven't had the time to get my computer repaired.It's functional."
1,"sound card eh? Uh-huh, sure thing","I bought 2 of these to use as inputs to my laptop from a sound mixer for remote locations. Big mistake... poor sound quality for anything but room ambience. The problem seems to be that the ""soundcard"" amplifies the signal to the max. I have found that if you turn the mixer control as low as possible, and turn down the mic controls on the laptop that you can get a passable signal, though not of any quality as to be considered seriously...pass on this one."
1,Buyer beware... This looks like the bootleg stick I bought elsewhere...,"I got one for 3 dollars on Ibiao dot com with FREE shipping and surprise, surprise, it did not work. And YES, it was the exact same as the one in the photo above.A ""real"" one can be found for not too much more money and will work far better.Try Griffin's iMic."
1,Broken,As I recived a microphone jack that was broke I was unhappy. I made a post about it. Eforcity read it and was concered about customer retention. They made it right with me and made me happy. Would I buy from them again yes. If I had to guess it was one out of a whole lot that was deffective and it happens. Thank you Eforcity
1,Maybe I just got a lemon,"Very simply, the unit I got barely worked. The plastic casing came off as I took it out of the package. Sound quality was terrible."
1,Don't buy two!!!!,"Don't bother to buy two to make sure you get a working one like others have suggested, I did buy two and both of them did not work at all. So I guess you need to buy at least three!!!For what you pay for them, the hassle of trying to return them is not worth while, but to you they seem toi be a piece of junk."
2,Works good but cheaply made,We bought it because our headphone jack is at the bottom of the laptop and it kind of interferes with the laptop pad. So we bought this and it worked really good but I could tell right a ways that it probably wouldn't last very long and I was right. A few days ago it broke. I wouldn't buy this product again. So now we have to find something that will work and not break so easily.
4,works good,"i bought 6 of these 1 was dead and 1 had static in playback.i bought this for my laptop, the volume on my laptop at full is lacking. i hooked up one of these and just about blew my ear drums out. i went from having the volume up to 100% to now down to 25%.i would had given this a 5 star but being that 2 were damaged i took one star off. if you do buy one i would really recomend getting at lease 2 just incase if you get a bad one."
3,Well it's cheap and it works.,"My friend had a laptop that he broke the audio jack in, so I bought this for him to use as a replacement. Works great, but it's fragile. Installed and worked without a hitch with XP and Vista. Just plug it in and it goes.I give it 3 stars instead of five because there is some barley audible noise and very cheaply made outer body. But hey $2 come on."
1,Did not work and fell apart.,"This item did not work from the start. I tied it in several different computers. When I pulled it out it fell apart in my hand. I put it back together and it still did not work. The seller is supposed to send me another at no cost to me, but I haven't received it yet."
4,GREAT VALUE,Less than 20 seconds in my older toshiba laptop with win.xp it was playing the sound strong and clear!!No setting up or anything...Havent tryed the mike input but I didnt want it for that..so for cheap and simple sound fix I will say order it!!!!!
2,good while it lasted,The card was fine while it lasted. It has stopped working at all. The drivers are not being recognized by my computer. The price was so cheap that I hated to ask for my money back but I would like to get a new one if that is possible.
1,A cheap product for a cheap price,Let's just say it broke within the week it arrived. You get what you pay for.
1,Bad Sound card,Very poor quality. I went thru 3 of these and they only lasted about a week. This is a poor quality product. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,A Waste!!!,Save time and just through your money in the garbage. It sounds worse than an 8 bit sound card from the early 1990's. Useless! Useless! Useless! Not worth the postage for a refund. I expected noise but this was just bad. It's cheap but you'll get less what you pay for.
1,Got my money's worth,I paid 3.95 and got my money's worth. The first time I used it it worked great. The second and third time it the microphone was breaking up. The third time it didn't work at all. Now the light flickers a little when I plug it in and then goes out and it doesn't connect at all.
1,stopped working after 5 days,"When i first received it, it worked very good with speakers producing good sound. the problem with this is the assembly. the sound card came loose from the usb plug in part and will not work. The casing is also flimsy (like some kind of snap together toy you would get from a cracker jack box). oh well, guess you get what you pay for ;("
2,"Worked, but bad quality","The plastic it's broke, when I received, trying to glue it back, all fell apart. Just black tape the board and it worked. And it's not worth to return it. What you pay it what you get. Beside the cheap quality, 5 star for fast shipper."
2,It worked great...until...,"Straight out of the box it was pretty flimsy and the USB head was loose. It worked pretty well for about 2 months then the device starts malfunctioning and won't even work. But I guess you get what you pay for. If you're looking for an adapter with a short life, look no further. But if you want one for the long run get one somewhere else, and preferably one that's better made."
1,Awful,"I got this product because my aluminum Macbook (late 2009) has an issue where the headphone jack is loose and can be easily disconnected with the slightest bump, but that's another problem. I had the same issue that a few others were talking about, no volume control, TONS of background static, incredibly bad quality sound. I'm not too broken up about it because it was so cheap. Still, don't buy this product."
1,Too good to be true,"I purchased this item to record LPs into my computer thru the input on this device. It sounded worse than recording through the mono microphone input that was built into my laptop. Had same experience with LOUD right out of the box too - startled me out of my skin! Mine didn't come with any disk although the box mentions software. Then again, I bought this from an Amazon 'partner' from Amazon. Spend your money wisely and get an iMic. I'm going to."
1,Not worth the money at any price,"I bought this gizmo because I managed to blow up my sound card and thought this would be an easy fix.It does work though the instillation is not user friendly;HOWEVER,the sound quality is VERY POOR -- not good enough to listen to music.Good enough for Skype? . . . well yes BUT I found the same problem as another reviewer -- the microphone input adds a high pitched whistle and hiss to your voice.So if you want to sound like your calling from an old pay phone at the end of an airport runway this might be just the thing!!!!I tried it out on a couple of PC's with the same result -- SAVE YOUR MONEY"
1,Junk,"Does not work at all. I would have returned it, but for the price it isn't worth the postage. The audio doesn't work properly. The mic doesn't work properly. It is just a device to make life more difficult for you. Do not buy it."
1,It doesn't work. Do not waste your money,"I bought this converter to use my old headset with my new laptop. I totally wasted my money and time. It does not work properly. It has lots of noises and it disconnects every now and then. It is not useful at all, specially for chatting, VOIP and skype.I didn't return it because the price of shipping is more than the value of it !Sooooo disappointing..."
1,Glitchy,I don't like it. It makes me worry my headset is breaking when it plays long beeps and crackling noises through it. It's pretty strong though.
2,3d sound usb audio jack,"i bought this because my headphone jack in my inspiron broke. when it finally arived it seemed to pop out of the plastic casing thats there to protect it, the usb seams to bend alot, and the microphone doesnt even work. if your looking for some thing to replace your audio jack and you want to use the microphone dont buy this. if you are just using the headphones but you move around alot i wouldnt buy this. but if you are just using the headphones and you dont move around at all then this you should buy."
3,WORKS GREAT BUT FRAGILE,I got it last week it worked perferct until i pulled the cord down and it broke it doesnt want to work.
1,Dead already,"Started getting flaky after 4 months, now completely dead. About what I expected for < $3, but still disappointing. Cheap construction. '3D Sound' is stupid. Also the inputs are mislabeled."
1,bad sound bad experience just overall bad,This item is bad it has a microphone jack on it but it does not work only the headphone work well some what cause it has tiny sound when you plug your headphone in when i try plugging my speakers in it produced no sound at all this item is just cheap and does not work like it said it does so do not even bother with buying this trust me you will not like it.
1,Doesn't work with Macs,"I bought this because the specs suggested it would meet my need for something cheap to connect my PC headset to my Mac, but the microphone input doesn't work. As others have noted the input bar lights up halfway on the Mac sound preferences, but there is no response from the mic on a PC headset plugged into this thing. It simply doesn't work as a USB device to accept input from a Sennheiser PC 151 headset, and presumably lots of other headsets that people use with PCs and want to use with a Mac. Sorry, but this product should be withdrawn. It's so cheap it's not worth the shipping to send it back, but my advice is to spend a few more bucks and get something with reviews that say the product works with a Mac if you're looking for something to use with your Mac."
2,Waste of your dollar,"I got this to use it my laptop . the casings are very poor and it torn off after few use . Also the music quality is also poor when i used my earphone to hear, I have used the same earphone on my Ipod and it has given me great quality..soo problem with this...I will recommend that u dont waste ur money as I did.. pay a few more $ and get a better one..."
1,Horrible,"As others have mentioned, there really isn't a volume setting for this device--it's either on REALLY LOUD or off. This product produces a hideous, loud buzz when hooked up to a Y cable or my Xenyx 502 mixer. I wasn't expecting much in audio fidelity from this device, but this is simply unusable. DO NOT BUY."
1,It's chip but not work at all!,I brought this Adapter not for the price but for slim size.But it is not work at all for I tried 5 desk top and note book which works with other brand.I give this adapter 0 star!
1,"Not worth it, pay more for one that works","You get what you pay for is the first thing that comes to mind with this sound card. When it works, which is a rare occasion, the sound quality is terrible. There is a constant hum while playing audio and when you place something on pause, there is a thumping hum that continues until you begin playing again.I have windows 7 on an older model HP laptop, and my built in sound card was not supported by the new operating system, therefore I bought this external sound card. I am close to buying a brand new laptop, which I cannot afford or I would have done that in the first place, just so I can have sound that actually works. Oftentimes, the sound card will just stop working, and no amount of unplugging and plugging it back in will make it work. I have to restart my computer and even then it sometimes only works for a few minutes.In conclusion, I recommend that you spend more money on an external sound card that actually works, and works well."
3,NOT GOOD FOR PC MULTITRACK RECORDING,This USB Soundcard is only good if your headphone ports on your PC no longer worksI tried to use this USB Soundcard with FL Studio 9only sound outNo Sound In.This USB Soundcard is only for crashed PC headphone jacks.Go for a better soundcard for your needs this sound card is not worth the headache for a few dollars.
2,You truly get what you pay for.,"In this cheaply made excuse for a sound card's defense....it's extremely easy to use, and it does exactly what it says it will do. The only problem, however, is the quality at which it functions. Very low sound that crackles, pops, and fizzes when it gets too high. Feels extremely flimsy, and doesn't fit securely in the USB port. I've wrapped it with duct tape after reading the reviews about how easily breakable it is. That seemed to help. I down-graded from Vista to XP, and I couldn't find the right sound card driver. I originally got another sound card that was absolutely wonderful, but my cat broke it, and I couldn't find it at the price I purchased originally. So I got this to hold me over for a while. Honestly, I'd buy it again if I needed a cheap fix for a temporary problem. But, if you have the money, definitely get something with a higher quality that will last infinitely longer. (Unless you have evil, destructive kitties)"
1,product not as described,"The description of this product implies that it has a condenser microphone. This is incorrect - all it has is a microphone jack. No built-in microphone. Other than that, it is a nifty little device, although I have to agree the sound quality is poor. It was instantly recognized however and worked with no driver installation (good thing too since it comes with no disc). All in all I wish I had not bothered with it since what I really wanted was a microphone. I sent email to the seller and they did not even respond ... not even an auto generated email."
2,stopped working after a few weeks,"Bought this because my kid somehow broke off his headphone jack inside his chromebook. We didn't have sound because it thought the headphone jack was still plugged in and being used. We were able to plug in gaming headphones with USB in and were able to override the headphone jack. The gaming headphone cord, was way to long. I bought this to plug a regular pair of headphones into. I read the reviews and I knew I was taking a gamble. It worked for a couple of weeks, and then just stopped. Once in the first week I was able to unplug, plug back in, and it started working again. Now it is junk."
1,Piece of crap,It just broke to pieces in my hands. Thanks for nothing! It's a horrible buy.... do not purchase this if you want something that will last for more than a few uses!
2,Don't buy it for the Microphone Jack,"Amazon won't update the listing on this item, but the ""Microphone Jack"" is a joke at best. Most microphones require ""plug-in power"", a small amount of power from the jack that amplifies the signal. This does not provide any power. What that means is that most PC microphones won't work, and those that do will be at a low volume with high noise. The sound outputs seem to work fine, but the mic input is a waste of space and money. It will probably work if you use a microphone is self-powered, but not very versatile. that Don't buy it!Griffin Technology 9066-IMIC2 iMic/USB Audio InterfaceThis product is vastly superior, and supplies phantom power. Get it instead."
1,Good Output - Terrible Input,"For speakers or headset this produces an acceptable sound. However, the speaker input produces low volume fuzzy and crackly noise. I tried in two PC's running XP and Vista with the same results. Plug the same mike into the rear input jacks and the mike works fine. If you need to use just the speaker output on this it works fine. I bought it to use for Skype, but it is useless for that."
5,Works great with my 3 laptops!,Easy plug and play mini microphone. As I got tired of hooking up a mic on a stand or putting a headset on this little guy conveniently plugs into one of my USB ports and I forget about it - nothing that dangles or flops around. The sound quality is very nice and volume easily adjustable. One of the reviews here have been negative but there are two products - one is a mic and the other a playback only device which I have not tried.
2,You get what you pay for.,"Worked okay while it lasted - not the greatest sound, and a lot of background static if you turned the volume up too loud. Completely died after only about a month and a half, however, so now I have to get a new one. I'd recommend that people take the short life-span into consideration when they're picking a USB audio adapter."
2,Never Got,This item I never received instead I got two of these.Virtual 5.1-surround USB 2.0 External Sound Cardwhich I guess is Ok I haven't used these as of yetbut hope they work OK.
5,Works perfectly,"I bought this because my netbook's audio connector died. After using this product, it works great! It does have some downsides though, the earphones I used work really well, but they actually get hot, nothing bad, it's just a bit uncomfortable. It could just be my ear phones though. I highly recommend this product. Another thing, I actuallly need to turn the volume to 1% so it's not too loud, So it has great volume."
1,Poor choice for mic jack,"Produced very bad buzzing noise that was NOT better than the onboard sound card. I wouldn't expect a $2 solution to fix my digital compression problem for recording voices, but was hoping that a simple solution would be enough. It wasn't."
1,Breaks extremely easily.,"I purchased this because the headphone jack on my MacBook had stopped working. I received it and immediately noticed that it was just TOO loud! Next, the case came off after me barely touching it. Next, the left sound channel completely disappeared,and I was only getting sound from the right side of my headphones (note I tested the headphones on other devices and they worked perfectly). And finally my computer stopped detecting it completely! Upon further investigation, two of the badly soldered connectors from the USB plug to the sound card had broken. I re-soldered it, and after 2 days it has stopped working AGAIN! Spend a little more and get something that wont break after 5 days!"
2,Surprised in a good and bad way.,"I bought this for a friend who had snapped his 3.5mm jack in his computer. He needed a way to use his old headset. We plugged it in and it was plug and play. It worked but had 2 major problems. First, it had a light hissing noise coming from the headset/speakers. Secondly, this is a big one, the left and right channels were switched. The materials feel very flimsy and the QC seems very poor. However, if we want to switch the left and right audio channels now we can just plug this in."
1,Didn't work,"This is on the item only I purchased 2USB adapters and neither one worked. I received the item very quickly it's to bad they didn't work, I would have lost more money if I sent them back."
3,"Easy to use, works fine","Pros - Easy to use, no installation discs etc. Tried it on Windows 7 and its just plug and play. On XP had to restart the machine after I connect it to the USB.Sound is ok, not great. But ok for the stuff that I usually watch / hear from my laptop.Cons - Have to twist the volume control on the higher side for my onkyo music system to which I connect my laptop with this adaptorLooks a little fickle, don't know when it breaks and falls apart."
1,Don't buy!!!!!!!!!!!,Ok I got this for my ps3 and it worked pretty good when I got it but like an hour after having plastic case fell of and like 4 days later it just stopped working I bought 2 and the second one stopped working at the same time and I hadn't even used yet.
1,Please don't waste your time with this,Purchased to facilitate plugging/unplugging of a headset/mic combo for use with voice recognition. As others have said the speaker volume is way off and has to be adjusted each time. Fatal flaw is no matter what I did the microphone would not work thru this piece of junk.It is cheap but then so what. They should be sending them out free of charge or better yet dumping them somewhere in the Pacific between here and China.
1,Does NOT work for recent Mac Book Pros,"Like the others who rate this product as one star, I found it to be totally unusable for the intended purpose. The seller does NOT list it as being compatible with Mac, for good reason, but based on other reviews I took a chance. It was a waste of money. My recent [Oct 2008] MBP did recognize the mic portion but there is a chronic 'clicking' noise about once per second as it cuts in and out that renders the mic feature useless. There is no documentation online or with the product, so it either works perfectly or you are hosed. The headphone portion will not work at all with my MBP regardless of the settings. I cannot tell whether I received a defective product that only half works or if it is truly incompatible with MBP but I would definitely tell other potential buyers to pay the exorbitant price for the Mac-specific adapters that actually work."
1,Did not work with my microphone,"I purchased this as a small inexpensive alternative to a name brand audio adapter that I used to connect a the Boom microphone to my Vista-based laptop for Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9.5 voice-recognition.I could not get the laptop to recognize the microphone hooked through this device. The laptop does recognize the microphone through my other USB converter.It does work with headphones, but that's not what I bought it for."
1,if it sounds (reads) too good to be true...,"need i continue. Junk. I had better quality with a string and 2 steel cans (one fitted to USB). I wanted something cheap and got it. Im not going to even waste any more time looking for a driver or whatever, nor bother emailing the seller. From now on I will read more than 1 review about a product. And that's all I can advise anyone else."
3,Great Amplifier!,"This thing does what it's supposed to- but it really amplifies the volume exponentially.For the price, it's great. Mine broke in two pieces (the plastic cover split apart). I snapped it back together and it is still working good."
2,Not all USB Audio adapters are the same,"I have a more expensive Turtle Beach device that works and sounds great. I assumed this one would have the same performance at a lower price but I was wrong. The sound quality is poor, with audible levels of distortion. Get the Turtle Beach one."
2,Underwhelming,"With the pricepoint and the $20 rebate in December and havinga gift certificate that I got for free, I bought this item in hopes it'd be a major upgrade over a way way (1999) older version of PhotoSuite. This software is OK, has a bunch of cool templates and project ideas, but that's about it. It also takes way too long to instantly load. Not a horrible software program -- especially if you get a $20 rebate -- but nothing to be very excited about either."
1,Absolute Nightmare,"This is without a doubt, the worst purchase I've ever made. Since I was only going to say what everyone else has said, I'll cut right to the chase....DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Spend your money on something else...even if it's bellybutton lint...it would still be worth more than this product. Customer service is nonexistent and the software is full of bugs. I would actually pay more for a product if I know it works and customer service is accessible. This is the second time I've had a problem with a Roxio product, and you can be sure I'll never buy from them again!!!"
2,much more complicated than Photosuite 5 Platinum,"I lost my Platinum 5 disc and could not find another anywhere, so I ordered 7. I was just short of sending it back, but decided to print the manual. It's much more complicated to work than 5 was, and that was very disappointing."
1,Horrible!,"Do NOT buy this non-professional, filmed-in-my-garage video. We thought we'd get a version of The Necklace to show to students who had read the short story but it was a joke. What should have been a 20 minute video was over an hour long with bad acting, bad videography, and bad music. Don't waste your money."
1,The worst video I have ever seen,"I bought this sight unseen to show my 9th graders when we read the story in class. It is so bad, acting, dialogue, camera work, etc. that they can hardly stand to see it. I use it as an example of how a great story idea can be ruined. I stress how artists make choices and how this is full of bad ones. I tell them that the stories we read may not be their favorites, but that they are at least well crafted works of art. This is not. Really, my favorite scene is where they replace the fabulously costly lost necklace with one they buy in a Hallmark Gift Shop."
1,The Worst Movie Ever Put to Film,Usually students are happy to watch a video - any video. But my students hated this so much that they asked to do classwork instead.
5,Skyliner,"Great fun! I walked across a darkened stage and 'whipped' the crowd up to a party attitude with just one message: ""Let's Party!"""
3,Not as advertised,"This product is advertised as the Skyliner III, blue, with 3-color changing LEDs. However, what I received was the original Skyliner, black, with only one color LEDs. Nothing in the ad identifies that you will be receiving the original unit, not the new upgraded blue unit. Do not buy from this ad if you are expecting the color changing unit."
2,Bad customer service,"Pros: Price, Screen size, Full size keyboardCons: It comes with toll free number for assistance. Every time you call them you get to speak with hard headed rude and purely unprofessional customer service executive.It does not come with any recovery disc. You have to create one by your self as soon as you start using your system.No user manual except pdf file loaded on hard drive with is really unintuitive and useless. After scrolling through so many pages you never find what you are looking for.If you play game for more then 20 min it gets really hot.Over all its not a bad deal if you don't need any help from customer service, can do without recovery disc and user manual and don't play games."
3,"TOO SMALL, TOO FAINT............","The concept is good, but.....the size and the paint...is too faint.If it were larger and had some desire put into it, then....maybe ok.Let me compare the size to ....a soda can in the hands of a gorilla at the zoo. The paint job, well....have a magnifying glass handy.Not worth the price........but the idea was great.....the size and the effort...surely not worth it........"
4,good,"Good wheels, fit my 2.2 tires and worked fine, good for their price, nothing amazing not to flashy but good wheels overall..also they shipped very fast. if you are ordering tire glueorder it from HPI because i got my glue from duratrax and now i have tires, wheels but no glue! i also used hip front steering tires, no issues so far"
1,A recruiting film,"This film is one of those commercials, you have to pay to watch. Luckily, I got it as an extra film with another film on DVD, so I did not have to pay a cent.This film essentially features old film material from navy SEAL training, along with some narration. The focus of the film is on BUDS training, which stands for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL. Basically, what they tell you is that in order to get into a SEAL team, you have to be in good shape, and be extremely tough mentally.If you can avoid it, don't buy this film. Even if you get if free, you still waste 30 minutes from your life by watching the film.Run time: 0:27"
4,Great value for the money,"OK, these are popcorn movies. So, just have to make that point clear. For its price, this is a great value. The movies look and sound great on blu-ray. Fantastic Four might not be the best superhero movie, but it's entertaining. Especially when you just want to turn off your brain and watch the special effects.Daredevil, on the other hand, is quite a good movie. Definitely the best in the collection."
5,Marvel Movies,I highly recommend purchasing this Marvel Blue-ray three pack. Blue-ray quality is great and the price is right. All three movies are Marvel at it's best!
4,Great price and all...,"...but if you bought this you'd then own both Fantastic 4 movies and Daredevil.Kidding aside, if you're a Marvel movie collector or just looking for some brainless action to kickstart your summer in HD, here's a good chance to do so at a pretty decent price. If you're an extras nut, you'd be better served buying these separately or waiting for a more in-depth collection. I'm sure Marvel is waiting to put together a ""Mega Pack"" but when, I have no clue, and I'm betting that premium will be pretty high unlike the nice price point here."
3,Marvel Box set,"the movies have a great quality, but the daredevil helped me to sleep like two hours....you can keep the fantastic four 1 and 2 and sell the daredevil..."
1,2 crappy movies plus Daredevil,"The Fantastic Four movies were absolutely terrible. Daredevil wasn't exactly a gem either, but at least it was watchable. My recommendation would be to just pick up the Daredevil movie (if you're really that interested in it) and not waste money on the other two."
2,Slips and slides,"I was very impressed with these durable mats when they came out of the box. They fit great, but I noticed they slip and slide around way too much. The mats don't have anything to hold them in place, like nibs on the bottom to grip the carpet. I'm really bummed. It isn't safe for my passengers especially getting in and out."
3,floor liners,"They won't stay in place, every time you get into the pickup they slide forward which pushes the sides in towards the center which then become a hazard when you move your feet around while driving. Not worth the money that they charge for them!"
2,A few annoying things,"I play most of my daughter's games; this one is no exception. A long while back I played a Bandicoot game on the PS1 and liked it. However, this one has a few extremely annoying problems:1. Of course, the load time - very discouraging2. When paused in a level, sometimes I accidentally hit the analog control and press X, thinking that it's still pointing to ""Resume"". Unfortunately, there is no yes/no confirmation to go back to the Warp Room and it kicks you out, having to endure another 3 hours of load time.3. 3D perspective is quite bad sometimes. At times, you don't know if you are in front, behind, or aligned with an item. I have fallen into holes way too many times just because I can't determine where I am.At this point, I am just playing it to finish it (I have all the crystals - I'm going back to do timed mode) just to see how it ends."
3,"Great graphics, but it misses the boat!","OK, I have to admit that the biggest problem with this disappointing game is the load time. I thought that I was more patient than this, but it is just too darn slow. Someone at Traveller's Tales should be flogged for the ridiculously slow loads in (and out) of levels.Don't buy this game unless you are an hopeless crash fan! It does have some cool levels, but while you are playing, you may want to have something to read."
3,Avoid,"Like the other reviews the basic problem is long and repeatitive ""loading"". You actually spend more time ""loading"" than you do playing..That quickly gets old and you'll find yourself not playing this game..."
3,Too long load times!,"This game has a strong plot. It also has great views. But the load times, AACK! It takes about a minute to load at the first screen, then after you enter your name it takes about 45 seconds, then 30 seconds in and out of the level.Don't get me started about the controls. They are way too sensitive. Once in the first level, where the islands are, I jumped like you normally would in a Crash game, and I jumped too far! Also, it's very hard to dodge things.I'm sorry to say this, but Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath Of Cortex went way below my expectations. Especially since it is on the PS2. Although, I read somewhere that the PS2's come with hard drives that producers can save things, so they load faster. Like in FFX, they probably saved on the hard drive, along with GT3. I guess that Vivendi didn't get in on that deal. Nonetheless, I give this 3 stars."
3,Loading...,"This is ok, itys exactly like the other games though, and the graphics are improved a little. But it takes hours to load, so I wouldn't buy it if you have any of the othjer Crash games, or you can't waiit the long load times."
2,Worst...Crash..Ever,"This game would be so awesome if there werent such long load times! I found myself waiting up to a minute and a half just to play a level. Travelers tales just horribly did a job with this game. And when I play it, it sounds like its eating my PS2 or something. if you have to get this game, get it for Xbox or Gamecube, cause with those systems you have noo load times."
4,this is agood game,"this is a realy good game, although there is one thing probably everyone noticed including me, it's loading times. This gam has to load to load to load. Don't get me wrong it's a realy good game exept for that one thing."
5,Long but fun.,This game is like the first crash games for psx but with new levels and better graphics. It has 30 leveles +5 (buy it and see). Most people don't like it because of the load time but I think it is still a good game. Some levels are hard but you get past them in the end. There are manny new powers and vehicles so it can be hard but once you get used to the game it's fun.
2,try before you buy,this game is baaaad.you will find yourself sleeping on the couch waiting for this game to load.the bosses are way to hard and youll find yourself dying alot.the music is irratating and the graphics arent great.butthe worse thing about this game is that the whole game is platform jumping.bottom line try this game first.
3,Buy Crash 3 for PS1 instead?,"Although it had all of the classic Crash elements, something was missing in this game. It was nowhere near as fun as Crash 3 for PS1--the best of all the Crash games, IMHO. Since you can get it pretty cheap used, you might want to go for it, but I'd recommend Crash 3 for PS1 instead. You can play it on your PS2!"
4,Not as good as the last....,"Although this game had a pretty high fun rating, in my opinion it is not worth the time it takes for the game and each level to load. First it takes a long time for the opening screen to come up, then you want to load your game and that takes another long wait, and then when you decide the level you are to go to it takes another 5 minutes... all of that and then you beat the level in 2 minutes. Aside from the loading issue, the game is all in all entertaining, although it lacks much challenge."
3,Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex,"I have played most the the Crash games for PS. The new Crash is just the same format as Crash 3 except for one very unfortunate difference. It takes forever to load each level. The levels in which Crash is rolling around in a ball is too aggravating! When I play games, I like to finish every level including bonuses and with this new Crash, I don't think I'll ever get through it because I find the rolling ball ridiculous."
2,What a load of ???????????????,"I am sorry, but!!! i have to say what everybody is saying this darn game is just bout loading, the game play is not so bad but i really prefer not watch a bandicoot falling for at lease 2 minutes before i can start to do anything, this game got to me by the third level i am so happy i did not buy this crap well maybe it's good game but!!!!! i had not the time to find out the loading is major set apart from other flaws and i really thought that this version would have been more interactive well,this game is a set back for a PS2 game oh please!!!!!!! what with the 2D anyhow i won't buy this, so if you try this then take whatever load of ???? you get laters folks/ gamers."
2,Disappointed,"Ive played the Crash games on PS1 and it was fun. After getting this game it has really long loading, you play the same boss over and over and a boring storyline. The only thing I like in this game is when Coco has fighting moves. Unless your a diehard Crash fan dont get this game. If you want a good kids game get Sly 2 Band of Thieves."
3,Unfortunate follow up to the PS1 games,"I've played all the PS1 Crash games to death, but this one, the first main series entry after Naughty Dog, isn't up to the same standards. It's very similar to Crash Bandicoot Warped in terms of level themes and warp room layout, with a bit of variety added in ""special"" levels where you do things like roll around in a giant glass ball or play as Coco. However, the colorful bosses from past games are replaced by a single new character (""Crunch"" Bandicoot) who uses ""elementals"" to gain different powers for each boss fight.The loading times are also really, really bad."
4,Good,"Well, it's a good game, I'll say that. It's definitely not as good as past installments of the Crash Bandicoot series. Really there aren't too many complaints from me, but... The load time is just horrendous, there are a couple parts where you'll get really frustrated, and there should'v been more variety in the bosses. Not like how each boss is fought, but who you face for each boss. I'd like to face the other villains rather than just Crunch multiple times over. Dingodile is perfect for the fire mask! Oh well... It's still a good game, I really do enjoy it, just not as much as other Crash games. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,"Good, but LOADING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This game is great. It's a really good game to be honest. The levels are just like they're supposed to, and stuff like that... But as soon as you press ""New Game"", then it hits you. LOADING TIME AHHHHHH!!! This is common in all PS2 games, but really? In this game is ridiculous! I find myself on the loading screen more often than I'm playing the actual game because I die a lot because this game is hard! When you get a game over, from what I remember, when you get a game over, it loads to get to the title screen. The when you press ""Load Game"", it loads to the file selection screen. Once you load your game and enter the level you were on, it loads to get to the level. Overall, it's a great game, but the loading kinda ruins it."
1,Buyer beware,"This game should have been called the ""Crash Bandicoot"" screen saver with interactive extras. The load times on this game are miserable!!! Plus the game itself is not as fun as the Crash previous Crash iterations. It looks like Crash and play resembles Crash but it is just not quite right. If you played the previous versions you will probably be disappointed."
2,Crummy game... Real Crummy.,"This game is crummy! I was truly not impressed, but then again the only Crash games I liked were the original Crash and CTR. The game seems like more and more of the same old ideas that were used in PS1 versions. Blah."
1,What Is This?,THIS GAME WAS SO BORING AND TOOK FOREVER TO LOAD.THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BORING GAMES NAUGHTY DOG HAS EVER MADE.THIS CRASH BANDICOOT IS TOO HARD AND IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT.THEY NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER .ALSO ITS NOT THAT GOOD LOOKING.FOR THE PLAYSTATION 2 I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK GOOD BUT ITS NOT ITS STILL LOOKS LIKE PLAYSTATION CHEAP GRAPHICS.WHEN YOU DIE IT TAKES FOREVER TO LOAD.YOU CAN TAKE A NAP AND IT STILL WONT BE DONE.THIS GAME IS NO GOOD SAVE YOUR MONEY BY SOMETHING ELSE ITS NOT EVEN WORTH RENTING AT A STORE.
3,Good game but something is just not right...,"I'm a die-hard Crash fan and I can hoenstly say the there's something off about this game. The load times are obnoxiously long, and some of the higher levels are way too easy and over too quick. Coco is now playable but IMHO she's impossible to control and doesn't do any of the ""power moves"" that Crash gets (Double jump, Wumpa Cannon, etc.). I'm not dissappointed that I bought this game, as it did scratch that 3-d platformer itch, but it's not the same quality of game that Naughty Dog made the series popular for."
3,everything is great but the LOADING SUCKS!!!!,"I would have gave this game 5 stars if the loading wouldn't take like 2 minutes.It has lots of challenges,but if you try to get 3 gems it would take more than 20 minutes because the loading takes a lot and while you try to make the gem or relic and the tries it takes to get the gem or relic, men it takes more than 30 minutes.If you are not fan of crash bandicoot don't even bother!!!"
2,Love to wait?,"Have you ever gotten home and wanted to play that one game that you just got a new code for, don't do that with this game. Unless that code makes the game load faster this game is annoying. If this was the first game I played on the PS2 I would have returned the PS2, and gotten a Game Cube or X Box. The graphics are not that great, and I hate the controls. When controlling Crash you feel like you are in a BMW M5 convertible that can only go a top speed of 30mph because of an engine problem. Everything about this game is slow. I wonder if the people who made this game were slow in the head. Other than that the game is fun. It is another Crash game, nothing special. But the loading kills the fun."
2,This is not Crash. This is NOT Crash!,"Remember when Crash Bandicoot used to be fun? Here comes a new generation of Crash! Apparently his new developers thought that ""fun"" is a bad thing. So they ""improved"" on the old one by making HUGE load times, terrible controls, and repeated everything WAY too much. The only fun things where hardly ever presented. If you have any other crash game. ANY at all, you don't need this one. It's just to boring."
2,Pretty Bad Game for a Pretty High Price,"This game is not fun. The music is too boring, the underwater levels are boring, and Crash Bandicoot looks like a toothpick! After you complete all the levels, you have to smash all the boxes in the levels and make good time trials to win. Believe me, this is bad! I don't know why this game can be sold for fifty dollars. The levels on land are pretty lame too. This is the worst game that I have."
5,crash the bandicoot,"this game is amazing!the new veichles are amazing!the gameplay is amazing!the levels are amazing!if your a big crash fan and if you liked the thrid one than you'll love this one.and for the first time coco is fully playable!...also there is a new character called crunch who is the boss for every level but he gets a new power every time by using the elemental mask.(the mask are:fire,water,earth,wind)and the last level he uses all the masks.and there also is a new crate to break open that turns you invisable!some of the new veichles are:jeep,dragon fly,helicopter,a ball you walk in,and a mech warrior.the only bad part of the game is the loading times, they can thake up 7 minutes at some levels but if you are patient you'll absoultly love this game!I advise any crash fan to buy this game or at less rent it!..."
2,"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW","We were excited to get a new Crash adventure game. What a disappointment. The game is fun to play, but not worth the SLOW LOADING. Every time you turn around, it seems like it needs to load again, which takes forever. If I had rented this first, I probably wouldn't have bothered buying it just because of the slow and often loading. What a disappointment."
5,"Game is great, loading is not.","I still say that the first one is the best, but this would have to come second of the bandicoot list. Take it from me, I got the first crash bandicoot game when it FIRST came out, and I know my crash games. This game is one you should consider if trying to buy a game soon. The graphics are great for the PS2, the gameplay is great as well, with about 30 levels (5 are secret), and you can be both crash and coco. And, for the first time, crash can drive the vehicles, not JUST coco. Overall, it's a good game if you can wait a couple minutes on the loads from level to level. After having the game for about a week, you'll get used to it......great game!!!"
3,Too Slow,"I really enjoyed the gameplay, but the load times between levels averaged around 2 minutes for the PS2. The same game on the X-Box platform averages around 10 seconds for the same load screens and the graphics during loading are a lot less annoying."
3,unbearable load time,"This game would garner 5 stars were it not for the endless loading. No joke, each time you enter a level it loads and loads and loads.... I've never experienced such a bad load time and we own lots of video games. The game itself (once loaded) is wonderful, many exciting levels, good graphics and lots of fun. It becomes too complicated for me (the mom) but my kids are great at it."
4,He's back and in pain,Yes crash is back and is kicking [behind] with new gadgets. thestory dosen't continue from the other crash games it's like none of that stuff has happened and Cortex is just starting to fight crash. the reason for that would probably be because naughty dog didn't work on this one. The graphics aren't as good as they could have been. Besides all that it is still a fun game to play.
2,Lame,"Can you say LOADING time. There is a ""menu"" stage where you select the level you would like to enter, then you stand on a number to select a level. And be prepared to wait. Takes average of a minute plus to load the stage(complete with annoying music). Its especially painfull when you walk over the wrong number while trying to get to the right number. It takes a minute to load then another minute to get back to the menu. Game itself had pretty decent graphics and it wasn't too hard or too easy. But I had to stop playing after the 10th stage because the loading time was just TOOOOOO annoying. You expect that kind of time out of a PS1 game, but not for a second generation system."
3,Its the same Crash I knew,"Well the game is of course great, as comes with every Crash game I own but once again the loading is a disgrace. I would much rather put in Crash 1-3 instead of waiting for this one to load. It takes 100x longer to load plus the graphics are the same. Other than that the game is ok but I still want my money back!"
1,I thought Crash games were cool?,"Well, I have rented this game. Had my PS2 memory all set to go. Man! You people wouldn't believe how long it takes just to exit, or when you have a game over, or if you want to save. A mintue to load up every time. That is a shame. The graphics were awesome, but graphics I am afraid kids, doensn't make a great game. It is the gameplay that does. Too long of load times. Boys and Girls, this was to me, a very dissappointing game. I LOVED the other Crash games, but unfortunately, Crash loses all his fir on this game. Bottom Line: This game does BITE. B-I-T-E. (...) Try it before you buy it. This game is almost exactly like Crash Bandicoot 3: Wrath of Cortex. They could of added a multiplayer game to it to make it a unique Crash experience for the PlayStation 2."
1,Definitely rent before you buy,"Games, like every form of entertainment, are subjective so I would never tell anyone not to at least try something out. I came really close this time. Lets start with the load time--this practically cripples the game and makes the whole experience annoying. The graphics, though not a big deal since really this game is for those into the CB series, did not impress me. Movement of the characters has an annoyingly N64 like feel to it. This was my second attempt at getting into the CB series and I think it will be my last. Those into the series, which I am not, may find something appealing about it although I'm not sure what."
1,LOADING LOADING LOADING,"Can't stand that this game takes forever and a day to load. That is all I have to say. The game is a lot like previous games, but it takes FOREVER to LOAD! If you don't mind waiting for the loading then go for it. Otherwise I would go for a different game."
3,SUCKS,"i bought this because i liked all the other crash games. it takes forever to load, and it has to load a whole heck of a lot"
5,pure soul,"I had been hearing good things about this one for a while, so I decided to go and see what all the hype was about. I am not disappointed. N'Dambi has that ""old soul"" vibe. She was one of Erykah Badu's backup singers and she has been compared to her, but N'Dambi holds her own. Some of my favorites are What's Wrong With You, Crazy World, Lonely Woman, The Meeting, and Rain. This is one of those albums that you can play from beginning to end without skipping any tracks. I am glad that I went out and bought this and you feel the same way after you pick it up."
5,Y'all gon' love this one!,"Love her voice. Love the instrumentation and arrangements. Love the lyrics. Love it, love it, love it!!! Please don't compare or have expectations of her CD sounding like Erykah's. This is a masterpiece that stands on its own. N'Dambi has got some pipes on her. I can't wait for her next CD to be released."
4,FIND LITTLE LOST GIRL BLUES IMMEDIATLEY IF NOT SOONER,"In a word this girl is baaaad!!! I know that she was playing second fiddle to Erykah Badu but damn!!!! she has the skills to pay the bills!!! Unfortunately this is one of those CD's that will inexplicably see no parts of radio. I was mad uptight over some personal issues when this CD came and I didn't check it out for a couple of days and when I did oh my god It mellowed me out with the quickness!! She covered the whole spectrum with straight R&B, Neo-soul,jazz & blues with a drop of hip hop.. This was a marvelous debut and if you don't cop it you're missing out big time!!! Listen to track 2-deep, track 3-rain, track 10-can this be loveoh and PS I told you so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I've listened to this CD almost non stop,"This is one of the tightest albums around yet no one seems to have heard of it. I have had this album since January and very rarely has it been out of my CD player. She infuses old school R&B with jazz (The Meeting) and even spoken word (Picture This). If you are looking for an Erykah Badu repeat you won't get it here. N'dambi is her own woman. If you are like me and tired of listening to ""cookie cutter"" acts where everyone is doing and saying the same pick up Little Lost Girl Blues you won't be sorry."
1,Poor Quality and Customer Service,"I purchased this radio on July 2, by August 15 it was shutting off automatically after being on for a few minutes. I had to pay a webservice for troubleshooting and they determined it was shorting out. I return it directly to Sangean, since it was beyond the 30 day Amazon warranty. I sent it back to Sangean on August 23 and still have not received it back, it is currently September 13. Do not buy this radio."
4,A new game in itself,"The creators of this game had the right idea. And they did an alright job at it. Action is everywhere. Non-stop. Sometimes that gets old, while other times it is just what you want. Bosses can be quite tough, that is a downside. SOmetimes too tough, especially at the beginning of the game when you have little developed skills and items to recover. I got frustrated a lot first playing this game. But I must say, once you get over those first few humps and start developing those needed skills, this game is action packed and you really get into. The action then is always fun. 4 stars with the slow and frustrating beginning as the downside."
3,OVERRATED!,"Not that this is a bad game. But, it is the definition ofoverrated. The story is one of the worst I have ever seenand the voice acting is worse than Resident Evil.The game was designed fine, not many glitches or bugs.It's just not that fun. Boring is what comes to mind whenI play this game. So Even at the marked down price Iadvise you to rent first. Some people love this game, but alotof people will be turned of by how dull the gameplay is.3 stars instead of two because there are few bugs and glitchesand it is a beautiful game."
2,super challenging,this thing was sooooo hard i could not even beat the first boss ths i sold it.otherwise its pretty cool
2,Onimusha fighting with more bosses less little guys,"Ok, this game has great graphics and gameplay, but it still doesn't work for me. I mean, I think I'm on the 9th level now, spent a load of time getting there, I've fought the same boss *BOSS* three times, another one twice, and I've had the worst time beating them both. If you're into fighting the same thing over and over again, this is the game for you. I think I'm biased because I bought GTA3 at the same time, and have found myself playing that game more by a factor of 10, but it just doesn't hold my attention. Would rather play every other game on my shelf!"
4,and you thought the demo was cool,saw this in the store and just had to step up to the plate. not hard core gamer but do enjoy a good game. my god the graphics are spectacular. game play is fairly straight foward. only fault is sometimes a task such as that jump on the stair case in the first mission seems almost unreachable. the first boss carracter can be a little discuraging also to get pass. game play is great nothing very difficlt in puzzel department which keeps game playing moving well. much worth the money.
4,Amazing. But replay value drops it by 1,"This is one of the truly best games for the system. It is a lot of fun to slash and hack at monsters in a game and this one is just about the top of the heap when it comes to this. Also appreciated are the amazing visuals, excellent character control and decent storyline. Best of all for me was the fact that the game is not too frustrating. Easy mode is fun to play through and doesnt have too many of the wandering around wondering what to do next moments of Resident Evil. After you finish this mode you can go back and go through in hard mode with ramped up monsters etc. Overall it is a fast paced thrill ride, definitely worth your dollars or at least an extended rental. A word of caution, it is a very violent game so it is not for everyone. Still for those mature enough to not be scarred by a story about a half man/half demon this game will hit the spot. It is a single player adventure."
5,illest,"i think this game is da best. it has a great story line, great plot, and great graffics. the bad part tho is that its short i beat it in 3 hours. but other than that this game kicks .... i hope they make a devil may cry 2..."
5,all that and then a lot more,"This game is truly the game of games. You play as Dante, the son of a devil, who is on a quest to avenge his mother and brother (wait untill you find out what happened to his brother). The game is pure fun as you blast your way through devil spawn with a variety of rapid fire guns, a sword with the skill that surpasses any you've ever seen before, and as if the guns and the sword wasn't enough, you can always just go with the hands and literally beat your foes to the next dimension. I'm an avid gamer, and if you can name it, I've probably played it, but there isn't a game that I can think of that's more fun to play than this one. The only flaw is that it isn't very long. But after you beat it, more levels of difficulty open up, each with their own rewards making them worth the time and effort. If I could I'd give this game more than 5 stars, I would, but..."
3,Devil May Cry,"Wow, what was Capcom thinking? Sure, the graphics and gameplay are excellent, but why make it in stages? anyhow the breakdown:Devil May Cry gets a star for graphics, control, and gameplay.The game loses on sound (repetitive battle songs) and replay."
3,Easily Beatable,"When I first Got Devil May Cry, I was Really impressed by the graphics, responsive controlls and the well thought out story-line. After the initial euphoria wore off, I began to realize that this game was way to easy, I beat the entire game in about 17 total hours,and died only once ( even though I fell off 200 foot cliffs several times). There wasnt enough choices in the game play,it was almost impossible to make a mistake in the missions and controlls,it took no skill at all to make huge jumps ect.. The biggest challenges were the secrect missions. Over all though it was a fun 17 hours."
3,good game bad camera!!!,i really liked this game... i had alot of fun but the abrupt camera angles made some of the boss battles much more frustrating than they had to be... it's worthy of all the praise graphic wise... and for the most part it's pretty fun... when your lining up your target and suddenly the camera angle changes and theres a pillar in the way... i understand this is a really challenging problem for 3-d game designers but you would think by now someone would get it right! i can't finish it... it gives me a headache.
4,Flawed but fun.,"This is perhaps one of the best beat-em-ups that the PS2 has to offer. In some ways, that's saying a lot (the controls are responsive and decently tailored to the environments, the combos are relatively interesting, and there is decent weapon variety) and not that much.Honestly, this game is all about hack and slash and kill the monsters; it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. There is little plot to speak of, but the monsters have interesting designs and the attacks based on what weapons you have equipped are quite amusing.Where DMC really falls down is the camera. I was tearing out my hair most of the time because, even though a camera angle may be good for being cinematic, it probably STINKS for gameplay. That and some overly annoying boss-battles and supremely difficult ""secret missions"" make it a bit less than perfect.Don't get me wrong, though, it's still wonderful if all you want is some good ol' fashioned carnage on the PS2. :)"
5,A Gaming Masterpiece!,"Although the game did seem short with little replay value, DMC is a masterpiece in gaming. I've been waiting for a game in the Survival Horror genre where the characters can actually ""jump"". DMC gave non-stop action from start to finish!"
5,Excellent Game. A must buy for the true gamer.,"This game has everything from a dazzling story to mystifying graphics. The environment seems to just move and make it incredibly creepy. The gameplay is spectacular with a perfect merging of camera angles, control, and sound. The music stands out in this game and just gets u totally into it, playing every time u face an enemy with pulsing house beats and then afterwards slowing down to creepy classical and celtic music. Definitely buy this game, it never slows down."
5,devil will cry when he feels dante's power,I think this game is great.Has great graphics and its so fun to swing the enemy in the air with your sword and then shoot the crap out of it with your twin pistols.You also get to turn into a really strong demon that gives you power for instance if you have the alastor sword your demon will have the power to be really fast in your demon mode and if you have the gauntlet of ifrit then it will be a fire demon you transform to.Buy this game you will be happy.
2,Same bosses used over and over,"The major problem with this game is that the enemies Daunte faces are all the same from level to level. You fight the same bosses two or three times in the game! That's not too much value or excitement for me. Since you spend your whole time in the same building, the enemies don't really change, so the new weapons and the ""devil trigger"" mode don't offer much in beating these same enemies you fought with the old weapons.Also, most of the game is fetching little rocks and keys to open doors, it gets boring after a while.I beat the game in about 10 hours. I have never beaten any game before, so that tells you how easy this game is.I'm not totally upset I bought it, but I think there are better games for the money."
5,Amazing.,"What a great game. The only downside to this game was that I finished it fairly quickly. If you like first person games where you have to go on 'missions', then this game is for you. Other than that, the game was amazing. It could have been a bit brighter though."
2,Bad Story,"I think the game frame is good, but the story and the cinematics were fair. When you have a machine with the power of the ps2 you ca develop better stories. I ended the game quickly not like his counterpart Resident Evil: Code Veronica X."
2,Sad But True :(,"As sad as this is, this game's graphics are awesome.....but that's where it ends. The game takes 6 hours to beat. I'd rent it and beat it that way then buy it and beat it the first time you play it. I rented it for 5 days(the video store's deal here) and beat it in 6 hours and 13 mins the first time I played it. Seriously the game isn't worth the price."
2,Game buyers may cry...,"... when they realize they shelled out ($) for a game they finish in about 7 or 8 hours. Good graphics (not AWESOME... just good), but the controls can be tricky. You can complete it in the span of a 5-night rental at Blockbuster."
3,Great... but a little to short.,"I really liked the game and after I beat it, I played it all over again but seriously, I own about 24 PS2 games and I have to say that this game has the worst graphics out of all of them, and it's 2 short, the boss is also stupid."
1,The most overated game of all time,"5 stars for this game? Well you judge by yourself. Consider this:The game is dark and boring, I mean really really boring, there's not much to see in this ""beautiful"" graphic. And it's only one location: castle. That's it, 23 missions inside the castle. HA! The game is very repetitive, just slashing and shooting the SAME enemies over and over again. The story, what story? I beat the game and I don't remember if there's any story in this game. The cutscene is only 10 SECONDS top. WARNING: AFTER PLAYING THIS GAME, YOU MAY CRY..."
3,I MAY CRY,"From playing the small portion on the demo, I could'nt see my self buying this game, I'd buy a poster of the cover. It has excellent movement compared to most other PS2 games, it has that good ole annoying camera angles you'd expect to work well but just don't, weapons of fair quality, weak graphics, terrible creativity of the enemies, all around, I say, good ideal, great title, could have been a real winner with so much potentional but that only gets you so far. So along with the crew who made this nightmareish game and who shortly will be crying from the sales, I too, share tears..."
5,A must buy,"When people walk into the room when you are playing this game, they can't help but stop a watch. This is the most addictive game I have bought so far--even more than Grand theft auto III. There is no better word to describe this game but COOL."
3,"i liked it, it keeps your attention and has a quick paced action","I liked it enough to play it all the way through [and i have no patients for games and will drop them on day one if they're not up to par] this game is short, which, for me in this game is a plus, because if it had gone on for much longer I would have eventually gotten bored of it not long after. But, it's a fun game, at a great price. [just no GOD OF WAR!!!!!!]"
2,"Fast Paced, No Depth","I found myself tapping the controller like crazy which was fun at first, but I didn't have to think at all to get through the game. For those of us who love to solve puzzles in a game, this game is more fun to tinker with than to actually try to master. I bought it when it was new for $..... then I had beaten it 3 times before the end of the night. It was a real let down at the time, but now I've found that it's a really great way to let off some steam at the end of a day. The graphics are smooth and pretty. The story and acting completely lack originality. The concept of using both a sword and guns was fun. Imagine Tomb Raider with more action but without all the puzzles."
4,missing the paper on outside,"I wish that the outside casing had the picture on it, and it came with no booklet, haven't played it yet, as it is a present for my son for Yule..."
5,Great game,Devil May Cry is like the first 3 resident evils but instead its a hack and slash game with alot of difficulty. Thats all that needs to be said.
5,Best game that I have played!,When I went to rent the new Resident Evil it came with a demo disk of Devil May Cry. I played the demo disk of Devil May Cry and had more fun playing it then the new Resident Evil because like some other reviews that I have read about Resident Evil is true that it's the same borning things. But when I play Devil May Cry I had fun playing the game. So I would recommend when the game comes out that you go rent it and see if you would like to buy it.
3,Satanic fun for everyone!,"Devil may cry, at first glance, will blow your mind with its beautifull graphics. But dont be fooled. Gameplay IS addictive, but the games subtle charms wear off pretty damn fast. The worst part about it is how it tries so hard to be resident evil, but just doesnt cut it. And what is SUPPOSED to ne a horrer title, is anything BUT horrifying. But, in order to give justice to a title, that IS decent, Ill list the pros and cons below, to let you decide for yourselfPROS:Eye pleasing fightswonderfull cutscenesbeautifull graphicsLots of bloodCool weapons and itemsDANTE KICKS MAJOR ...!CONS:Low environment interactionCheesy as all ... storylineRepetitivnessAlot of runaroundThe charactor is a regualer supermanLow replay value"
4,Great game,"GFX: Top notch. However, there are a few misc errors in the graphics. (while running the sword will go through his vest, and a couple bitmaps were stratched) but other than that, 9/10 graphics.Story: A very shallow storyline. Basically, (dont read if you want the story spoiled) your new girlfreind is after you, and your brother is a demon. In the end, you kill the bad guy. (nothing real special) 2/10Sound: Good sound, some voice acting was a little corney. but othewrwise, you could hear anything and everyhing. 7/10Goals: you get a breif set of goals every mission, however, somtimes its a little unclear what your still supposed to do. 8/10Conclusion:Over all, good game if your into beating things to a living (OR DEAD!) pulp. I gave this game an 8/10."
3,Nice Game Weak Plot,This game is good for rent not to buy. The best thing about this game is the game playand the graphics which are great. On the down side it has a poor storyline compared toMetal Gear Solid 2 and other games plus I got sick of fighting the same bosses over andover and at the end the game is way to short. It could of been a great game with in depthstory plot and characters backgrounds for exp. the character Tresh who the hell is she? Itfelt to short this game felt it was not completed
4,simple yet fun,"Devil May Cry is a great game for the sheer fact that you feel like you're kicking major butt the entire time. It's a fun, but simple game. The monsters are not terribly hard, puzzles are easily solved, and the story isn't too imaginative, but they made up for that with the action. All you have to do is go crazy with the controller and you turn into a hyper active killing machine. The environments are beautifully detailed and the action is quite smooth. It is short game, but so are most. It's good to play when you don't feel like anything to complicated and want to get some frustrations out."
3,Horror game = Horrible graphics???,"Devil may cry is real exciting, non-stop action, puzzle solving, a must have game. It has great mini games doubles the fun. However, the control is terrible and the camera angle is so horrible that it gets real frustrating. And same looking monster again, and again... Boss is real tough and real challenging but anything related to graphic..."
4,Short and very sweet,"Devil May Cry is a PS2 game which brings in some intense action. The graphics are superb, as is the gameplay. The storyline is quite lacking however. During fights, the game switches to playing some fast and heavy metal beats that help fuel the player. The fixed camera angles in some areas are very obnoxious. If you're looking for depth and lenth in a game, move on. But, if you're looking for some fun, heavy action, this is the game for you. Total play time to beat the game is around 6-7 hours...good for a quick fix."
4,sometimes they make a game like the movie desperado,"Holy crap! I was blown away by the style of this game....well done. Fast paced, great graphics, super-mega easy puzzles so you can get right back to bustin caps! The only thing I don't really like about this game was the storyline....it's ok at first but the ending kinda blew...as well as I was done with game in less than a week. The controls are good but not on normal....never have I had such a bad cramp in my arm. If there was an auto fire button...it would be better...but I'm whining to much. Good game, one of the games that you have to play in your life!"
5,A must have for any PS2 owner.,"I just wanna say that this game rocks. It's easily one of the best looking games on the market right now and to top that, it's just flat-out fun to play. It does have a few flaws, the story is a tired cliche and it's a little short. The length of the game is excusable because of the sheer replay value. There's plenty of that. Playing through this game once is not enough and that's an understatement. You are ranked for your performance on every mission and going back and exploring what you missed before really makes the game a good buy. IF you're thinking of plunking down your $... on this, and you haven't played it yet, it's definitely a safe buy.The graphics, alone, are worth the money, but this one has the gameplay to back them up."
3,just a copy,I ve played this game and all it is is a cheap comination of final fantasy and resident evil i mean your running around theres final fantasy and the weapons are like somthin out of ff and killin monsters thats just takin a page out of the grandaddy of hooror games resident evil so but the game if you want a copy but if you want and origional than get resident evil or one of the final fantasy's but i can not complain about the graphics or gameplay
3,Junk,"This is one of the most boring games I've played. The storyline is almost nonexistent, the fighting is very repetitive, and the puzzles are extremely simple. The graphics are nice but far from perfect. The controls are frustrating due to a horrible camera system. The sound is the only decent part of this game. So out of a perfect 5.0 I give it:Graphics: 3.5Sound: 4.5Control: 3.0Fun Factor: 3.0"
4,Looks Good...,"I bought RE: CVX only partially because I like Resident Evil. The other reason was to see the Devil May Cry demo. From what I have seen this game is just the kind I like. I like challenge, but am not huge on super complex puzzles. I like long games, but a 20 something hour long game of Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger is a bit much.From what I have read, and what I have seen in the demo, DMC has a good blend of puzzles and mindless hack & slash (and in this case shoot as well), and it won't take me 20 hours of play to finish."
3,Rent this first,"While this game is indeed fun, it's short and lacks replay value. I would recommend to anyone interested in buying it to rent it first. In all likelyhood, you'll beat it before the five day rental is up. Granted, I thought it was really fun and would recommend it to anyone who likes resident evil style games, but don't spend the $... it costs. Pay the $...rental."
3,You MUST rent this game; you MUST NOT buy this game.,"...the game is too short!It's fun for the first couple hours, while you get used to blasting away at monsters of all types with infinite ammo, double jumping, doing insane sword/gun combos, looking at the very pretty graphics, etc.After those few hours, though, you'll find the fighting to be incredibly shallow (i.e. the opposite of ""deep"") and even tedious as enemies regenerate after each pass through a room. Add to this the [easy] puzzles (""This statue seems to be missing something. Will you insert the scepter?"" etc.) and you've got a game that I beat in five hours on easy (I rented it).It's got some ""whoa"" moments near the end, with some truly monstrous monsters, but it's just too easy/short to warrant the great reviews it's gotten from magazines. Definitely worth renting, though."
5,capcoms best triumph since resident evil !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game in a word unbelievablelots of actiongreat storylinei have some people giving this bad reviewsyou should be ashamed of yourselvesone the best ps2 titles i own so far besidescode veronica x onimusha warlords and the sims bustin out
4,One of the best,"This is quite possibly one of the best games i have ever played. The graphics kick, the battle sequinces rock, and the beats while fighting get me pumped. I love games that are actually challenging, the hard mode is exactly that HARD!!! there is also nothing more satasfying than pulling off a huge combo.Thanx,-=Phil=-"
4,"An incrediable game, but short","Devil May Cry is a great game, in almost every aspect. Although there are only a couple of enemies they are incrediably well thought of and hard to beat. The enemy files are also very cool I keep trying to get a full file on all bosses and enemies. The background is incrediable and the many weapons and moves are insane. The buying special moves is a great idea along with the devil trigger mode. The special missions and hidden blue orbs also add a great miniquest throughout the whole game. On my first try I only missed two secret missions and three blue orbs (out of 40 something."
5,This Game ROCKS!!!!!,"THis is definitely one of the best games i have ever played!!! At first it's a little boring but at the 3 or 4th levelit gets unbeleviable. It took me 3 days to beat the game the first time cuz i played it so much, then it took me about 5 hours to beat it the second time!!! If u r lookin 4 a action packed game go get this game now!!"
4,A great choice to take over the Resident Evil reigns,"I was greatly depressed when I found out Resident evil was leaving sony for the gamecube... but not anymore(after playing this game!) It first caught my attention when I found out it was originally intended to be a resident evil game. I can truly see some some similarities (think fixed camera angles :( Other than that, this game shines!! Making you collect orbs to ""work"" for new special moves is a great idea! At first, I had a little trouble not getting some of his moves mixed up, but after about an hour all was well. My hat goes off to you Capcom for a game worthy of filling the void left by RE's playstation injustice to move to the gamecube... What are u thinking??????"
4,A Must Play Game...,"This game is one of the best games I have played. The game play is fast and graphics are superb. I really like the different ways to attack and kill the villains. The only drawbacks are: 1. Some of the cameras angles can cause you trouble, especially while fighting. 2. I don't like the concept of have into pay for weapons and enhancements. The main character should evolve though time and take weapons from the main enemy. If you own a PS2 and like action packed games, then Devil May Cry is a must own."
5,A must get game,Devil may cry is awesome. The graphics are dope and its awesome how you play as Dante half man half demon. The camera view sucks but its the fighting scenes are awesome though. Its unbelievable. The graphics are good the gameplay is awesome capcom have really out done thereselves on this game. the control are cool and easy to master. Its Really brilliant game that you should start saving up for.
5,Let the truth be told!!!!!!,"Darkwah has cut a huge portion of the fabric that ""world European lies"" have used over the ages to conceal the greatness of the African people. His book seems to eloquently shed light on subjects that have been blurred for years. I recommend, not only blacks, but those who seek the truth to buy this book. This is the beginning of an information revolution. To those who have an ear, let them hear."
5,Book reveals info that whites don't want you to know!,"I must say that it was a very enlightening experience for me to read this book. I read it with a bible and a dictionary handy. I found my self asking all kinds of questions, and challenging what I had been indoctrinated to believe for quite a while. This man does an EXCELLENT job writing this book. He is very intelligent and coherent and expresses himself on the topic of which he speaks with authority and confidence. Unfortunately too much of this information is not ""common knowledge"" like it should be. I think once this information is widely disseminated, this will plant the seeds to the destruction of white supremacy indefinately! I look forward to reading the follow up book by this author and would love for this book to receive more exposure for it is as impactful and pivotal as any major literature on this topic is likely to get."
5,Great Book,"I purchased this book for my wife and it arrived in perfect condition and the sender was so concerned that she followed up with a personal message. The book is a great account of the role Africans played in the writing of the Bible. Much of the information is not reported widely or is know wihtin a very small circle of literaries. If you can obtain this book at a reasonable price, get it. Don't contact the publisher because they've been sold-out for many months. You must find a private seller to secure the book."
1,Some people believe anything,"This book is obviously written by a crackpot. How in the world he got the ""Dr."" is beyond me as it is obvious that this is all conjecture and not based at all on any kind of solid research. The statement that todays Jews are not related to the Jews of the Torah is absolutely absurd. There are genetic links to the past, and this is especially evident in the lineage of the High Priest, the descendants of Aaron, or the family of Kohen/Kohn/Cohen or any of the other variations of the name. Perhaps the author should rather concentrate on the gifts that the blacks have given to the world instead of trying to appropriate someone elses."
1,A different spirit,I saw this book in a book store and refused to pay retail fora bunch of hogwash.Man didnot write the bible. Man was simplya secretary guide by the Holy Spirit of God. When allscholars of the day said that the world was flat.God in his bible said it was a sphere.When man said the earth rested on theshoulders of atlas or some great turtle God's word said it wassuspended in space.The same Spirit that moved men to write the words of God is the same Spirit you need to understand it and take it by faith. Dr. Darkwah doesnot have that Spirit.
3,Sodas,The crackers were old (stale). I am familiar with these crackers. I bought them all the time when I lived in Miami; but I cannot find them here. I would order them again if I could be assured of freshness.
4,Enjoyed,"I enjoy this series so far I have read the first three secret clan books,and am attempting to get the fourth."
1,Couldn't get through it,"After the third description of the hero's cornflower blue doublet with gold bows and lace at the wrsits, and the puffy pink satin inlay on his stockings, I had to put the book down. I realize the author was trying to make Alex as different from Fox as she could, but the constant descriptions of his fussy, sissy-like clothing ruined the book for me. There's no way a man in pink stocking could be sexy to me."
3,Not What You Think,"Most of this CD is instrumental music and those tracks that are vocals are actually covers that sound like a wedding band. The instrumentals are soothing but be warned--NOT ORIGINAL RECORDINGS! Once I got over the shock of the CD not being what I thought it would be (original recordings), I found it pleasant to listen to. If you like instrumentals of old and new favorites, this is a great CD to have."
3,inconsistant spacing?,"I ordered 6 of these pulls. After drilling the holes for three I noticed the screws didn't line up with one of the pulls. The spacing was 2-5/8"" not 2-1/2"". Luckily the rest were correct but I was sure to measure the spacing before drilling the the rest of the holes."
5,I recommend with confidence,The sound is incredibly natural and the album deserves all the money. I am very pleased with purchase. It's an album that should not miss from any collection.
1,Beware,"The cords for the headset are extremely thin, and damage easily, I took a gamble with these and 3 months later, yet another sennheiser headset needs replacing."
1,Not good at All,I got the MP3 download of Dolphin Dance by Sounds of Nature and I wouldn't recommend this album at all. The reason why is that you cant even here the dolphins sounds at all.
5,My Best Phone Yet,"This phone has everything, the features, the excellent reception, the camera quality, the speakerphone, I mean what more can I say?"
2,This phone has connection problem,This phone will automatically turn off during talking or ringing. And the picture has problem also.
1,What? Huh?,"All the good stuff you've read about this phone is true. I have only one issue with this phone. I have trouble understanding the other person. Especially when there is any kind of background noise. I read all the reviews and figured the people complaining about the sound quality were probably using the wrong end. I really wanted to like this phone.Unfotunately, being unable to hear and understand the person on the other end is a deal breaker. Perhaps I just got a bad phone. I'm going to exchange."
4,Great phone!,"I have been with Sprint for almost 2 years now and have had 3 different phones. Out of the 3 I have to say that the Sanyo 8200 is the best. I love the screen call feature. I've read the other reviews and alot of people complained about the audio quality. I haven't had that problem. Now, I just recently had to get a replacement under the warranty because the vibrate did not work but other than that, I think the phone is great. I love the design of the phone, its compact and light and comes in 4 different colors. I orginally wanted the red but went with silver only because at the time the Sprint store that I purchased the phone from did not have the red one in stock. Im thinking about upgrading though. I never keep cells phone for a really long time. If something new comes out and I like it, I usually buy it. I like the new Sanyo 5600 but Im not keen on spending $500 for a cell phone. I think I may just settle for the Sanyo MM 7400."
5,PURE QUALITY SANYO PM-8200,"I was not out looking for a Sanyo but when I saw and read about the features promised I had to find it. Sprint was great at the store, and the phone sold itself. You can tell by simply feeling the hinges and seeing the screws they used this was no Motorola that would fall apart after a month. After 5 months I am still finding services that this phone offers to the user.I love it, I just bought another for my wife last week."
1,Horrible sound quality. Stay away!,"I have had this phone for almost a year now, and although the signal reception is great, the sound quality on this phone is HORRIBLE! I have to ask the person calling me to repeat themselves at least once every call because the voice quality is so muddy. My wife has a different (and cheaper) phone and it sounds MUCH better. The only reason I have put up with it this long is I do not use my phone very often. I would not recommend this phone to anyone. This phone sounds worse than any other phone I have owned. Stay away from this phone!!!"
1,TOO Bad - NOT worth it,"Well, I was very happy with the phone when i first bought in about a year back. Not anymore.. I bought 2 of these for myself and another for my family. I even recommended this phone to a couple of my friends, but now everyone of us face the same issues. But neither Sprint or Sanyo wants to acknowledge that there is a problem with the phone.- the pin type charger does not work - the battery charge indicator is one BIG lie - just after 2 minutes the battery indicators shows full charge but in about 5 mins the LOW battery alert is up.Whenever i try to charge, i hear beeps as if i am plugging and unpluging the charger.. But the phone does not charge(although the battery indicator shows full charge)."
3,Good at first...,"I was pretty happy with it at first, light, good looking. The problem is that the sound is really not good and it lacks a lot of the features that I loved on my previous Samsungs. For example you can't scroll down to the previous numbers you called after you hit ""talk"", it only keeps the last one, so you have to go into the menu the look for the outgoing calls... not convenient. On my 3 previous Samsungs, I also liked the fact that I could stop the ring when I received a call. So for example I would hit any side button and the ring would stop, then I could take it out of my purse and answer without eveybody noticing me. I find the menu also a little messy.In other words, I am going to return this one and buy a new Samsung!"
1,Will not Charge!,"Had this phone a little over a year, same problem as everyone else. Won't charge. Shows charged, but then make one call and it is dead."
2,Cracked circular bar.......,"I have exactly the same problem Daniela had. The circular bar has cracked after one year. I was always VERY CAREFUL with the phone, never dropped it.I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
1,very disappointing,"I was waiting for my book, then i got an email that my order has benn canceled. i ordered 7 days ago with my the other book, i got all but this one..."
5,This is a wonderful way to start!,"Although I'm only on Part 1 of the two parts to this set, I'm very pleased with what I have read so far. For people who aren't internet-savvy, I would recommend reading an HTML book first, then get this. He is clear in his explanations, however, so it's not entirely necessary to buy an HTML book first if you're crunched for time - just get this one. I highly recommend it - it has tips on advertising, marketing, web design, merchant accounts and SO MUCH MORE! And in 650 pages, it's almost a guarantee that you're going to learn a lot. I'm anxious to get to Part 2!"
3,Contact Provides Hours of Fun,"This game is great for the RPG gamer who enjoys all aspects of life. Reminds me a lot of a mix between earth bound and animal crossing.The only thing I hate is that it is very hard to do multi player (which is required to fully complete the game.) The other person has to have the game cartridge and have to both be able to connect to Wi Fi.A piece of advice to those planning to share this game with family or friends: Get a separate game for each of you, otherwise you may never get to play again. It is quite addicting."
4,its fun,"it is a fun little game i recommend it as a gift, story is simple and easy to understand and it works, have fun playing it if you get one"
4,Contact,"This is a weird little game. it's crazy, unique, and so incredibly fun and addictive it's insane. If you like earthbound, and killer seven, you've just found their love child."
2,Too much hype...nothing interesting delivered...,"After all the Hype about this game I bought it...well in my opinion it just felt flat on its face. The game simply is not very intersting and the storyline can be plain boring. There are other RPGs out there that are better and you simply get immersed in the story line quickly. The battles get boring extremely quickly since all you do is kinda point and tap the same guys over and over. The ""costumes"" and ""decals"" are kinda stupid. Many said this was the next EARTHBOUND, well is NOT and not even close. The Nintendo DS has so much potential and this game does not deliver in graphics, sound , game play and fun. dont get me wrong the game is not horrible by any means but defitnetly not that good either. check out some reviews out there before you buy it."
1,Correcting another myth,"I would just like to correct two statements of fact in an editorial review of Fire in the Night.Publishers Weekly states that Wingate is the ""only foreign officer to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery"".Whatever his achievements, Wingate is not unique in this regard. There is at least one other foreign officer buried at Arlington, namely, Field Marshall Sir John Dill. He was the British representative on the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee in Washington during the Second World War who died very much in harness and was buried in Arlington as a mark of the respect his US counterparts had for him.The same review also contains another error - the plane carrying Wingate crashed in March 1944, not 1943."
3,Serving a Limited Purpose,"I am one of the initial contributors to this trial primer from the ABA General Practice Section. The orignal authors, all veteran trial lawyers, produced a work designed to help the occaisonal litigator get through the morass of a jury trial.First published in the mid-1980's, it had become a popular book for the ABA Press. Recently a Second Edition was released, which attempts to bring the guide up to date.Within its modest ambitions, the book works. It contains numerous checklists for each stage of the pretrial and trial process. It cannot substitute for trial experience, however or with knowledge of local practice rules.If you don't get to trial often, this book can help. That is all it ever aspired to do."
4,One thing...,"Love it. I like how they loop the lessons over and over, but they should have looped the same one a few times before they moved on to the others. I have to keep rewinding. And there are no different angles like they say there are. But overall still a happy purchase."
3,Im getting worried....,"I own all five seasons of the Big Bang Theory. I was really looking forward to the 6th season due to how much I liked Season 5. The first episode of season 6 was just o.k., as was this one. A couple funny moments, but also some serious moments.I watch Big Bang theory for the comedy; not the drama. This is not one of the better episodes overall. Its OK. Episode 3 was better so Im still hopeful."
3,Leonard can be such a wuss!,"Just when you think it's safe to raise your head above the Penny-Leonard Mendosa Line, Leonard turns into a girl."
2,Too funny to ruin,"Why do the writers keep making Sheldon seem so much nastier than he used to be? He was always a sweet, if not clueless, guy back in episodes like when he was surprised to discover Amy was sexually aroused by Penny's old boyfriend Zack. I hate to see the jokes all be at the expense of female characters who the writers continue to stereotype. It's bad enough Amy and Bernadette can no longer be portrayed as smart and Penny as ""only"" being a waitress and Leonard's girlfriend. Those women are just as hilarious as the guys! Their characters deserve funny lines that aren't reduced to crap about their ovaries!Please don't turn this show into Two & a Half Men and Modern Family's trite misogynist one-liners. Please ... I love this show!"
4,The beginning,"I haven't seen everything yet... obviously..., but what I have seen is great!I can't wait for the entire season to be completed!"
2,Not a fan of Season 6,"In Season 6 it seems to me like the show has just fallen off a cliff. I can (and do) watch Seasons 1-5 over-and-over until the end of time, but Season 6 is just a huge pile where even one viewing of each episode is way too much."
4,Funny show.,"The Big Bang Theory makes fun of science. In doing so, I believe it motivates minds to find out what the humor is about. Like myself, many who are motivated to look, will not gain an IQ like Dr. Sheldon Cooper, but will at least learn something they did not know. Something they saw no reason to know. Yet after learning it, will retain it in the brain for the next time it is used on the show. (Awakening a yearning for knowledge using comedy is a good idea.) While looking for the science that makes a joke funny when spoken in (as Penny calls it) jibber jabber, the opening of books or online encylopedias or online science references, the seeker learns things. To some extent it is an educational program with a comedy twist."
2,No no no!,"Love this series.... hate this turn. I was just so happy with the normalcy between Penny and Leopnard... Please, Writers.... don't do this. Mess with Raj's love life. Or Sheldon's. Or get Penny knocked up! Nerd babies! Yeah! But turning Penny and Leonard into love sick fools again, yeck."
3,One sad show!,"Penny is getting fat, Sheldon is more of a pain. I have gotten to the point that I fast forward through scens with Sheldon in them.There is less each week that is funny. It has gotten to be a sad show."
1,Seriously,What is the deal with this show???!!! Why do people think it is clever/funny/entertaining?? The Big Bang Theory is far and away the worst sitcom I have ever seen. I can't believe people actually like this dogs***. I can barely sit through an episode without falling asleep or changing the channel out of frustration of how awful of a show it is. Want to watch something funny? Try Curb Your Enthusiasm or Peep Show.
1,Its free on CBS,Ok whats the deal this show is free on CBS web site. Why would I throw down 2 bucks to watch it here for 24hrs?
5,My Valium!!!,"I am so addicted to this show and every time I watch ""The Big Bang Theory,"" it's characters and storyline never ceases to make me LOL.I own all the series and I watch ""The Big Bang Theory"" everyday; it helps me to relax after a stressful day.....It's my Valium!!!"
5,The Bomb! Love it!!,"I love this show! The actors are wonderfully funny and so cute! I have watched every season and they just can't write new shows fast enough for me. Wonderful! Thank you ""Big Bang"" cast for all the laughs!"
5,Great Show!,"So far this season has not disappointed me, and I doubt that it it ever will. I look forward to each show."
4,"Still a riot, but the seams are starting to wear.",The gang are back and the relationship dynamics keep growing and changing. But the joke is starting to wear a little bit. Here's to hoping they don't jump the shark too badly.
5,Best show on tv,"This show is hilarious. If you are a ""geek"" or know a geek it's even better. Every week This show makes me laugh"
5,Six seasons and still hilarious.,"Still going strong, and a great counter to too many reality shows corrupting tv. This show is just as good as Friends."
5,The Higgs Boson Observation,What can I say! Big Bang Theory is always hilarious. Not sure how they nail it episode after episode. Watching Amy be jealous over Sheldon's new assistant was interesting. She is such a funny person!
5,Continues to evolve,The first season that Bernadette and Amy are part of the main cast. The main storylines and sub-plot is separated amongst the male and female cast with lots of cross over. The show somehow remains fresh after six years. Sheldon continues to grow as a boyfriend while finding himself in trouble sometimes due to his lack of social skills. This is the only sitcom we watch.
5,always great,"This episode doesn`t contribute to the storyline but its funny, worked well on logitech review. Startrek comiccon car theft more words"
2,Lack of subtitles,The TV show is perfect but I think that Amazon should provide the different subtitles available on a regular DVD.
5,Big Bang Theory keeps on entertaining me,"I love this show, it never ceases to make me at least chuckle if not guffaw. The actors are fabulous and the characters and situations hilarious. I'm finding Season 6 just as good as previous seasons, for me this show has held its level of quality humor very consistently, which is tough to do. Bravo, Big Bang Theory, and may you have a few more seasons left in you (at least)."
5,big bang,"There isn't a episode i don't like in any of the season,my favorite character is sheldon, its just very funny and entertaining."
4,Enjoyable,"On this series, I think I'm getting my money's worth.Episodes for the most part are entertaining.I'm not a big fan of ""humiliating the character"" type humor, so knocking a star off for some of that.And it seems like the female cast continue to get more and more snarky ( *itchy) as time progresses.But overall a good comedic experience."
5,"Great writing, actors and characters","The writing is witty and innovative, the acting is top notch and the characters are off beat, and interesting ."
5,Excellent show...,"So many funny twists and turns... Makes me wonder if there are real people like Sheldon, Howard, Raj, and Leonard... I have to admit, NASA is a good sport in all of the crazy things the gang does and its implications... Hope the show continues for many more seasons!!!"
2,Great playing; third rate music,"Stephen Coombs plays beautifully, wasting his talent on a work which imitates Rachmaninov's textures without ever being able to sustain a melodic phrase of decent length or breadth."
5,Flour Sifter- 5 cup,I love my Endurance Flour Sifter-5 cup it does just what it was made for.I use my Sifter quite often and I am very satisfy with it.
5,Superb Insight....,"For those of you who are interested in doing business in China or investing there this is a MUST READ! As a small, private investor, ""China Streetsmart"" provided a much better piture of what it takes to be successful businessman and investor in China. And I am here to tell you...as the author strongly states..it takes more than good ""guanxi"". If one follows the ""China Streetsmart"" guidelines, you will have an overwhelming advantage (versus other investors and businessmen) in achieving great success in the world's next great growth economy."
2,Mr Corporate please stand up.,"If you just married the bosses daughter and got a position you didn't work for. Then obtained your first passport to go negotiate some multi million dollor deal on your first trip to a foreign country then you may get through this book. As an independent businessman with multicultural dealing worldwide it took about 2 minutes to realize I wasted my money on this one.Learn a bit of Chineas Business Ettiquite, be nice to people and save your money for Dim Sum."
2,"Sorry, it's junk...","I've been doing business in China for more than 10 years. I believe most readers would benefit from reading some other books (""China, Inc."" and ""Chinese Business Etiquette"", old and revised, but still a great basic resource, and the HBR's ""On Doing Business in China""). As I drag myself painfully through ""China Streetsmart"", I can't help to wonder if Mr. Chan decided to spin a piece of quickly put together stories hoping his last name would sell the book."
4,Good Perspective on the American West,"The Jesse James Scrapbook relives a tumultuous period in the history of the United States through a skillful recreation of historical figures. The aftermath of the Civil War is brought to life in the characters of the James brothers, Cole Younger, William Quantrell and various other noteworthy perpetrators of mayhem who closed out the era of continental expansion ...strife that marked the interval between Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt.The author, George Jansen, has written a work comparable in technique and effect to Gore Vidal's Burr, which also uses a fictional narrator to present history. Aside from its narrative thrust, The Jesse James Scrapbook makes admirable use of the argot of those distant days and is reminiscent of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn in that respect.I recommend The Jesse James Scrapbook to readers whose interests lie in a true perspective of the American West of the 19th century."
5,Required for class but used not so great,"The material in the book is fine, works for the class and studies. But for getting a used one was not so great:My wife is getting her masters and this was required for a class. By the time she found out what book was needed only used were available. But unfortunately the previous user had highlighted and filled in the answers for quizes. But she was stuck with the book because class had started.Not sure what the solution is nor how to understand seller ratings. I guess try to order early if you can so you have time to return/exchange it or try to buy new."
4,Review from ME!,This book is a very helpful resource for my class. It gives alot of useful information. It uses some terms that we don't really use (but it's only a few).
2,Save your money,The two stars are for the pool itself. It seems to be fairly sturdy for a blow-up pool and my 3-year-old grandchildren have gone in and out hundreds of times and it hasn't sprung a leak yet. But all the gizmos they advertise with it are expensive junk. The slide is so wobbly the younger kids can't really slide down it without falling off sideways. It takes too much time to put together all the gizmos and they don't work well after you go to all that trouble. We ended up just buying a used plastic toddler slide and putting the end of the slide into the pool and it was much safer and much more fun. The ring toss was pathetic and the basketball game wasn't much better. Just buy a good quality toddler pool without the bells and whistles and make your own fun with sturdier equipment.
2,WAY smaller than pictured,"This pool is sooo much smaller than it looks in the picture. The slide is a little small for my almost-three-year-old (and she's not big for her age at all) and it is a joke when my 4 1/2-year-old tries to get on it. The slide is about the same length as his legs.Also, the slide is very tough for the kids to get on...it is really wobbly.We got this for $35 at Big Lots and I think it was worth about $10-$15."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I agree with the other review. The children on the box have been digitally shrunk to make the pool look about one and a half times as large as it really is, which is shameful on the part of the company making the pool. The slide is wiggley even when tied down securely. It is not worth the price being asked here. However, if you can find it on super discount, as I did, the pool is worth it for a few fun afternoons of splashing around. Face it, kids just like to get wet! My kids are 3, 6, and 7 and quickly got over the fact that it was way smaller than expected and made the best of it and actually had quite a bit of fun. They even made a game out of the unbalanced slide."
1,Buy something sturdier,"This looks good in the package, but none of the gizmos work. The slide is wobbly so my grandchildren slide off sideways before they hit the water. The ring toss was cheap and useless and so was the basketball game. The pool is also much smaller than in looks. Buy a normal pool and add some other gizmos to the pool or yard. You will spend the same amount of money and have something that works and lasts."
2,Leaks,Size met expectations. I used it within about 3 days of getting the product. It was a very wet night and morning. Not just outside the tent. Inside as well. Water everywhere. Horrible.
4,good for the price,"i'm comparing this tent to a similar Coleman one I've used. Overall a good tent for the price i paid (was about $100). I used this in Yosemite when the temperatures reached the mid-30s at night. It doesn't hold heat as well as tents designed for colder temperatures, but luckily our sleeping bags were more than up to the task. The tent goes together well and is pretty roomy. I did not test it's water resistant properties."
1,Just had my vacation ended by this tent,"After just 4 uses, the tent tore at various places especially by the loops for the stakes, one of the poles broke, zippers broke, and bugs migrated at will during the night.Junk, junk, junk. Run away from this tent."
3,"cheap price, I got what I paid for",I bought these covers which were a perfect fit. They lasted about six months before starting to shred and tear. I am now looking a better quality item.
2,Good for one season,"Bought several of those to protect my outdoor furniture. All of them tore within one season. We don't have harsh winters in South Carolina, but the few days of below 32F were enough to rip all the protectors. I bought better ones now with 3 year warranty. Lets see how long they hold."
3,Patio Chair cover,"I wish you had stated the color in your ad. I was hoping it was dark green,like most of the patio covers I've seen. I was not happy with the black,but kept it anyway. My other 3 are dark green. L. Luther"
1,Not as pictured,This grill cover only covered the main head of the grill. the legs and the propane tank are not covered. the material is cheap and ripped already. Highly do NOT recommend.
4,perfect for what I needed!!!!!,"these were perfect for what I needed, I have 4 chairs on the deck with cushions, I just wanted to be able to sit on my chairs in the morning w/o them being damp or wet. These covers have served that purpose. They do well in the wind (chgo windy city). They are easy to put on and take off, they store flat or I just tuck them behind the back cushion."
2,Not very sturdy,"I purchased six of these covers. They are okay for a light weather environment I suppose. But afer 1 week's use in rainy fall weather three of them ripped near the edges. They are still usable. However, they may not last throught the winter. And, I certainly doen't expect to be able to use them next season. So, I'd pass on these covers, if your thinking about purchasing them."
4,looks good,can not really review at this time. Purchased it at after everything was put away for the winter. Plan to use it as a cover for an usual size table on the outside back porch. Looks like it will serve the purpose.
2,A More Difficult Laibach Listen,"This is, to me, perhaps the most difficult Laibach listen. More random and chaotic then other albums, harsh, definitely not soothing (I find the ""Through the Occupied Netherlands"" tape soothing, if that tells you anything!) Nonetheless, an interesting live document."
5,"Great cutter, great price",You may think that spending $40 for a cigar cutter is crazy but once you try this cutter you will change your mind. The smooth spring action and the smooth cut is well worth the original price of $60. Make sure you register the cutter to get the leather case too.
2,thin,"This is not as thick as cardstock I am used to. I can't actually use it for, you know, CARDS. It's too floppy."
1,Terrible!,"I wouldn't suggest you order this product if your going to put it on your car. I had mine less than a week before it cracked and fell off, and too make things even better the seller would not replace the sticker or refund my money because I didn't have the sticker. Talk about great customer service!"
1,Where are the track listings?,"Nothing sells a CD any faster than a listing of the tracks on the CD, and if possible sound samples. I for one would never purchase a CD not knowing what was on it. Money is hard to come by nowadays. Why gamble on ordering something that may not be worth the money? I am also a big stickler for original recordings. New versions of the original hits by the original artists just doesn't cut it! People like original recordings by the original artists. With the price of this CD it is very possible that it isn't worth the price. Merchant should list the songs included on the CD, and specify if they are the original hits. Why be deceitful, and dishonest?"
4,great filter,definitely superior quality.. it reduces some haze over my other cheap filters so i suppose it's a good buy :P
4,Good filter...Great price,"The Super HMC UV filter is distinguished by the optical coating on both sides of the glass. This is a high quality filter and worthly of high end lenses. I have them on both an 80-200mm f/2.8 and a 17-55mm f/2.8 Nikon lenses. No demonstrable reduction to the image quality is visible on images taken with either lens. In my sports photography work, I am typically right on the court very close to the action and having the glass of a $1,000 lens exposed is too much of a gamble for me. The only downside of this lens is that it's a bit difficult to clean as streaks seem to stick to it if the lens cleaning cloth (microfiber)isn't wet enough with cleaning fluid. However, I've found that if I flip the cloth to a dry spot right and swirl from the center outward to the edge, away go the streaks. The price ($39) through the Amazon affiliated dealers is excellent."
5,It does what its supposed to do.,Nice UV filter. It does what its suppose to on my Canon 100-400mm L lens. No reflections are flares with this coated filter. Excellent UV and haze filter and nice protection. Got it through Amazon's fast and good service. I would recommend it to a friend.
5,Great for Tug of War and Playing,We picked this out at the pet store and our dog immediately took to it. She loves playing tug of war with it and wandering around the house with it playing. It's also a big soft toy to put in her crate that she can use for soft bedding. She seems to love it. It has been pretty durable. I highly recommend it.
5,Even cuter than the first one!,"This CD has the same idea as the first LollipopRock volume--to take hit songs and put new lyrics to them that make the songs fun and friendly to kids. This volume deals with issues such as learning to ride a bike, getting in trouble, facing fears, heroes, taking a bath, and others. It's a fun album that the grown ups in the house won't dread listening to--in fact, you might find yourself dancing along with the kids if you aren't careful..."
3,Not a racqetball player,"The balls bounce and work well in handball, but i;m not actually a racquetball players. However, you can find this product at a cheaper price at your local sports store."
3,not so fast,"These racquetballs shouldn't be named Premium Select, because they play only as regular balls do. Not as fast as rated."
4,Excellent reading but primarily written from a Union view.,Admiral Bern is an entertaining writer of history and manages to include a lot of personal anecdotes from letters and diarys. From my knowledge and visits to Civil War forts around the country the author appears to be historically accurate. I would coution that the author seems to be writing primarily from a Union viewpoint. I am sending the book to some of my Navy friends.
2,Wait a minute...Sam's diary?,"Sam's character does not strike me as the type of person to write in a diary or 'thought book' as he calls it. I was very dissapointed in this book. The plot was way off with Sam wanting to get together with Lila. I really wish the author would go back to the plot they previously had before the secret diaries came into play. I'm dieing to know what happened. All in all, this book was OK, but deffinatly not a must read."
3,NOT good for my Crosman Phantom,"I had purchased two tins of these pellets after viewing the positive reviews, but any experienced shooter who owns a Phantom knows that it is picky when it comes to pellets. I purchased these pellets in hopes of achieving higher accuracy, but my hopes fell flat. While the penetration was excellent, the accuracy was plain horrid. I had groupings of 4-5 inches at 25 yards, and for a hunter like me, that's completely unacceptable. Even for plinking that's unacceptable.Now I don't want to bash on this pellet because I have not tried it on other rifles, so I am giving it three stars. If you are a Phantom owner however, stick to Crosman pellets. I seem to have greater success with Wadcutters."
2,Like this pellet,"Ordered 2 tins recieved only 1 was charged for 2, and the 1 I recieved was loose in a too big for item box (pellet users know pellets get damaged that way) complained bout this nothing came of it..........................was credited for 1 tin, of the 250 in the other tin got maybe 100 good useable pellets with lots of lead dust form rolling around......."
3,Technical Paper Rollup,"Book is essentially a compendium of technical papers on specific economics topics subject to the application of Control Theory. The book includes a robust set of useful state equations and associated optimality problem statements, but I would have appreciated a more general discussion of the application of control theory to management science that ties all of the book's subjects together into a single, cohesive framework. The book focuses almost exclusively on the trees rather than the forest. As such, it is best suited as a supplement for graduate-level studies."
4,Head of the Class Board Game,"I loved this game as a child and ordered for my grandchildren to play with me. It is for older kids than is listed, as the questions are harder than 7 and 8 year olds can do. I will enjoy it when they are old enough."
2,slow,"I have read other Linda Needham books and loved them. This one I could not get through. And I paid for them to search for it for me! If I hadn't paid so much for a paperback, I'd trade it in a the used book store! I loved the hero and really disliked the heroine. She was unworthy. I hope that the good books of Ms Needham were not the fluke."
5,Works with both the original Genesis and the original Nintendo NES,"Be sure you're getting the real thing, not an aftermarket knock-off of variable quality. These are getting up there in age but if they still work today they'll continue to work. There's nothing glamorous about a power brick. The main thing to say about this (and the main reason I'm writing) is that if you need a power adapter for both a Genesis and a Nintendo NES, get this one, and it'll work for both, and you can save a few dollars. Just as importantly, the reverse is NOT true."
5,Oregon Trail 2,"This is a fun game I played at school more than once. Once I caught so much game, my wagon couldn't carry it all! I enjoyed playing it and am now asking for it from Santa."
1,Rings fell apart despite great care - same story,"I'm among those not satisfied and wishing they'd spent the money elsewhere. Our 77 mm polarizer sat nicely on the lens for less than a year, then fell apart with no understandable reason.We handle our camera with great care, same goes for the lens. As casual photographers, we used the Hoya 77mm polarizer as the lone filter for the 77 mm lens. Since September 2008 we never even took it off the lens. One day it just divided into two parts... totally out of the blue.We're very disappointed. I'm going to discuss the situation with a countrywide dealer, but the lens was bought via Amazon, so for me the case is lost anyway. I doubt I'll spend significant cash on Hoya again :("
4,vignetting at wider than 13mm,"The quality of the filter is good. However, vignetting is a problem when your lens is wider than 13mm."
2,Disappointing,"Why, oh why, would you start a Catholic Bible reading plan with the CALENDAR year rather than with the LITURGICAL year?"
2,Only read if you don't want to know anything but some general info,"The difficulty of being freshly diagnosed with breast cancer is that you don't know which questions to ask. And this book allows for priming questions that will allow only for standard, allopathic treatment protocol. Very 'normal', it does not provide full information on treatment possibilities, or the danger of conventional treatment."
2,Start with another Cloud Cult album,"This album is definitely not where you want to start if you're new to Cloud Cult. Start with Advice From The Happy Hippopotamus and move onto their other albums before going to this one. There are a couple good songs, but as much as I love Cloud Cult, this album feels self-indulgent compared to The Meaning of 8, Light Chasers and Advice..."
1,About Tinhead....,"eh, this game isn't the best video game I've played but it is a bit interesting.The backdrops and graphics are wonderful but the action play can sometimes get a little confusing.I am not discouraging nor encouraging anyone to purchase this game but who knows, maybe it will be your favorite!"
3,Doesn't support laptops.,"This product doesn't support computers. I bought it for using a laptop and it makes a high pitch tone and then shuts down within seconds. The laptop only draws 55 watts, far less than the rated power of this unit.I had to return it."
3,Tripp Lite PV375,"It works well and came just as was advertised. The only negative I have is that the fan is extremely noisy. You almost have to cover it up with blankets to drown out the sound which of course keeps heat from dissipating from it which means you need a noisy fan which means ....My brother has a Monster brand and his doesn't make all that noise. I went with Tripp Lite because of the name and historical quality but if another name brand has a product that has the same features, is just as good and quieter, then I'd go for the other brand. This machine is really noisy."
3,"Good, Could be Better","Inverter is good value for the price. However, I when I plugged my laptop into it for power, it generated enough interference to wreak havoc with my touchpad positioning and clicking."
1,Unreliable. Stay away.,I have used this unit occasionally. Used for less than 10 hours total within year and half since I bought. Never overloaded or abused. I only hooked up my laptop to it. It just died (blows the fuse when turned on).
3,Drained battery.,In the discription it said that there was a alarm that will warn you if your car battery is getting to low. However the alarm goes off after the battery is already draned and the car will not start. With that said the inverter worked for five hours at a time and never blew a fuse just the battery got blown so be very carfull with turning your car on every few hours and running it for a some time to make sure your car battery is charged up.
3,Not so hot for Ham Radio mobile,"Bought the Tripp Lite to power a laptop for ham radio mobile contesting. Some hams had success with the brand before. The inverter hash was really bad, wiped out weak signals on the radio. Had to add bypass caps and ferrites to make noise acceptable with ignition off. But the noise from the Tripp Lite went ballistic with ignition on. Finally gave it away and used a different laptop that would run on 12 volts."
1,Damage my car fuse and broken after a few months,"After a few months of usage, it keeps buzzing. I follow the instruction to off and on the power switches many times. It blows out the car fuse. I didn't have anything plug into it."
4,Worked well for our camping trip,"The unit worked well to blow up the air mattress, charge phones, &c while we were camping. No complaints. A longer cord would be a nice addition though."
5,Simple and basic features that work,"My old inverter died and I needed a new one for a trip. Searched high and low for a reasonably priced sine wave unit that was well reviewed (thought I might move this to my truck after the trip and have it handy for tools). Too expensive for these plus I would have had to plug in to the battery directly to get the published power ratings. Turns out pretty much anything above 150w is more than your cigarette lighter can provide anyway so this unit taps most of what is available inside the car. My two complaints would be the single outlet and a lack of a USB connection for charging phones, iPods, etc. For the money, this works great. I also like the fact that the smaller size and ratings nuked the need for a fan and that makes it considerably quieter than its big brother, the only other inverter I was serious about. Excellent value and does the job nicely."
4,Reviewof Portable Inverter,I have used this inverter to power my lap top computer and it has worked very well
5,Does the job!,"I bought this inverter for an extended road trip to power a laptop, phone & battery chargers and to power an electronic menagerie. It worked perfectly even with both outlets under full load. Fan is audible but not abhorrent; unit stays reasonably balmy, never searing ' it may warm your Dr. Pepper but not cook your Cole Haans. This unit replaced a lower capacity inverter that couldn't keep up with the laptop's power supply but this 375-watt workhorse gets the job done sans drama. Highly recommended!"
