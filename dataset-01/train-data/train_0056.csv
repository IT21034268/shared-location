5,"An eye-opening, compelling story about the People.",Forget all the cowboy and indian stories you've read. This is a story of the People of the plains told from their point of view. I've read the series twice and enjoyed it immensely both times. The character development is superb. You will become a part of their culture.
5,Excellent historical for all ages!,"In the tradition of Wagons West and White Indians comes the thrilling saga of a frontier so wild, so free, so magnificent that only men and women of unyielding courage could claim it. This novel begins the saga of the Elk-dog People, the first Native Americans of the Central Plains to tame the horse for use in hunting and war. The first in an incredible ten-volume series."
5,Indians treated as they should have been treated!!,"This book peaked my interest to read more and before I knew it I was hooked. I enjoy books that put the Indian in a good light rather than as a blood thirsty person. I am sure there were plenty of bad and good Indians, like there were white folks with all their dang haughty thoughts of themselves. God created us all equal, the Bible says."
1,Not much here,I was dissapointed in this little book. It looks like the book was rushed out to capitalize on the war and Rumsfeld media attention. Not much here in terms of learning - Rumsfeld is pretty command and control.
1,A desultory read,"This book was lazily researched, devoid of any discipline or focus and suggested nothing more than an effort to capitalize on Rumsfeld's recent celebrity in the guise of a management book. That it was written by an editor with a major publisher is astonishing. I found it's primary value to be as a way of getting to sleep after a long day."
1,You gotta be kidding me,"Leadership lessons of Donald ""Rummy"" Rumsfeld? The man who doesn't let little things like world events, force capability, or the experience level of his senior commanders get in the way of his version of reality? Ok, I decided to keep an open mind. After all, as a military officer, he is my in my chain of command. But after reading this, I have to agree with the reviewer from the UK - rubbish. The only lessons you will learn here are those that show you what not to do. Rumsfeld has single handedly alienated most of the senior officer corps, not to mention most of the military too. The anger within the military towards Rumsfeld is growing. I wouldn't be surprised if, push come to shove, at some point the military refuses to do this man's bidding. If it keeps up much longer, a coup seems certain. This book, if followed, will lead to the same situation in your company - divisiveness, anger, and ultimately implosion. Don't waste your money on this."
1,The Title Says Everything,"The Rumsfeld Way! Ha! Perhaps it is too harsh to give this book one star. After all, if read from the proper perspective this book might provide some valuable lessons such as:*Ignoring reality*Getting involved in a catastrophe purely by choice*Not listening to those more knowledgeable than oneself, and humiliating them for attempting to give advice*Alienating all of one's subordinates*Creating unnecessary enemies all around*Putting the lives of those for whom you are responsible in grave danger through one's incompetence and indifference*Speaking in a convoluted and irritating wayFollow the Rumsfeld Way and you too can be an utter failure!"
2,The Rumsfeld Way,"I give this book 2 stars for its comedic value. What a hoot! Tough ole Rummy, who never fought a battle in his life outside a board room. This book's best use would be for lining a litter box, but I wouldn't insult my cats that way."
4,A good explanation of the man.,This book was a fairly easy read and explains the way Rumsfeld has chosen to lead and take chances throughout his career. He's the youngest man to be elected to the House of Representatives and the only man to serve as Secretary of Defense twice. Once you read this book you'll understand how he's achieved success in government and as the CEO of major corporations. It's worth the price of admission.
4,Good One,.I just finished reading this book. And I must say that it is one of those no-nonsense books.There is no doubt that Rumsfeld is indeed a Battle-Hardened Maverick. He is a sort of licensed trouble-shooter and crisis manager.The book takes you thru Rumsfeld's ways of dealing with people and issues. Or Rumsfeld's recipe for success.At the end of each chapter the author summarizes the key ideas covered in the chapter.Worth Reading.
2,Little substace,"This book has very little substance. It written in a strange style, and little summaries at the end of each chapter. This is a very fast read, double spaced and all. Though this book does have some interesting facts it is far from a bio or an account of Rumsfelds time as SoD. I wouldn't pay full price for this book, but if you want a quick read get it used!"
1,Horribly racist and not well written.,"This book was awful and I had to throw it away 2 hours after reading it. I just think it is full of falsehood and frankly is so overtly white neo nazi racist I was gagging. I'm white, I'm into preparedness, I'm a constitutionalist.. yet this book is completely false. I will fight alongside any race that loves and values freedom. It really has nothing to do with race, it's about your respect for property rights and freedom. This author gets it all wrong because he's SO HUNG UP on race. He thinks the US will divide into 3 nations by race alone. How dumb can you be. I can see that the mexicans aren't integrating into US culture and that is a concern... but black folk, some hispanic folk, just as white folk will defend our constitution. This book is defending the KKK and all other white neo groups..."
2,An obsolete tome of another time and place....,"I found the book to be for the most part to be irrelevant to current times and situations. The author is obviously fixated on problems with race which while somewhat relevant concerning the nations' situation in failing to stem the mexican invasion, it falls flat almost everywhere else. I would not recommend it to my friends, and would not keep it as a part of my personal library...In fact, I would suggest that Amazon remove it from it's listings as it has little or no value to the consumer unless they were a white power racist stuck in the 1990s."
1,There's a grain of truth in every story.,"Chittum has done a fine job of collecting statistical facts that point to the racial polarization of American society. Much of what he writes could well become fact. That being said, this book serves as fuel for those that need their racist views validated. If you think that the U.S fought on the wrong side in World War II, you'll love this book. Reference the reviwer below that stated that their preferred reading was ""The Turner Diaries"" and ""Hunter"", books written by William Pierce, head of the American Vanguard."
1,Good Grief,"Oh, how sorry we all should feel for poor Mr. Chittum and all his reationary friends who have to endure the horrors of living in a progressive modern state based on such heresies as universal human rights and tolerance. They might actually have to live next door to a Cambodian or ride the bus with a gay person. Boo-hoo! Better to revert to the Dark Ages and found new warlike nations based on blood, soil, and religious fanaticism. Not im MY future, buddy. If anyone turns America into ""another Balkans"" it will be people with ideas like those in this book--not liberals."
4,Products of the past.,"The proposed problems this book relates to are the same problems we had in the late 1700's , the late 1800's . All having to do with a Gov't imposing their authority over a people or culture . If and when this episode happens it is at best 130+ yrs. belated. I do believe there is a limit to ones complacency , regardless of race/ethnicity."
5,The Real Thing,"With uncontrolled immigration, overpopulation and over-development and the prevailing attitudes of everyone doing their own cultural thing, the scenarios presented in this book have a better-than-average chance of happening, I believe, as do others I talked to.Don't be swayed by talk of ""racism"" or ""alarmist.""If you really look, there is much evidence in our world today to suggest that the ""elites"" are trying to do just what Thomas Chittum proposes, (eliminate the working and middle class to gain power) and so is the general population, which is predicted to be in the hundreds of billions in years to come, much like third world countries.Read this book and take it to heart. You will probably weep as well, for what we are already losing, (The USA as we know it) but don't just cry, do something."
4,Dated but Pretty Accurate in Many Respects,"It's hard to criticize a book written 15 years ago which makes bold predictions that don't come to fruition, but are pretty close to the mark. After the LA Riots and the increase in crime in the early 90's, the idea of America fragmenting along racial lines seemed pretty compelling but I think the author overestimated the speed at which collapse would take place. In any event, this book is a worthwhile read because many of the predictions concerning a possible collapse and civil war may still come to pass. In addition, the author provides some good information on what to do if things fall apart. It seems to me that we are more likely to move towards a police state and economic collapse, rather than outright civil war, but it is also easy to see the polarization of our country that could confirm the author's vision in the next 5 to 10 years on account of failed leadership from both political parties."
4,Chittum's Done His Research,"Chittum is dead right when he notes that multicultural nations rarely hold together. Diversity is a solvent not a solder. But like the previous reviewer noted, not all of his predictions hold up. In Chittum's defense, future predictions rarely hold up in books whether they're about the weather or about economic forcasting. And some of what he's predicted is coming true (ie, the increasing push for reparations). This book should be read by all those living in high-diversity areas. And one thing is absolutely true, and that this book is a compelling read, designed to get you focused on the problems to come; because they are coming. And whether they take the form of Civil War II or, as I believe, a sort of smoldering Lebanon, we should be ready."
2,"I didn't read the book, but he forgot one fact...","White Americans are evidence of multiculturalism working. How many white Americans do you see with the name ""John Greenberg"" ""Steve Bjornsen"", ""Richard O'Neil"", ""Daniel D'Amico"" and so on? Lots of them. We didn't get those last names by accident, but rather by multiple cultures melding with each other, adopting the main culture, and discarding the old culture as incompatible with their new life.Our multicultural society has worked and it will work once the new immigrant groups assimilate into ours. However, he does have a point that some of these immigrant groups resist assimilation."
4,Plausible? Most definitely......,"The author, who fought as a rifleman in Viet Nam, Africa, and the Balkans certainly has a unique and uniquely qualified perspective. His 'republic to empire' progression is certainly different from other writers. I don't agree with some of his conclusions, although he indeed presents a scenario worth pondering."
5,A must read for a Patriot,"This book is in my library because the man had an insight,on coming events.He wrote this book in 1995,and talks,relates on issues that are taking place as we speak.For one,Mexican army incursions into the southwest.This was on 60 minutes,with footage,so don't say it did'nt happen.This book outlines how to prepare,how to protect,and to keep our species(white)alive.You are going to need survival skills in the future,so you better start now.For those of you who can't smell the coffee yet,I hope God loves you,because to do nothing,your going to need it.This is no joke,look at the events in this country right now,tell me everything is rosy,if so,your a fool,and may God have mercy on your soul!"
4,Obama Nation,"I am not one to overreact, but this book could have been written today.If Obama wins and we have a super majority of Democrats, we will become a socialist nation--by Executive Order.If Obama loses, riots are going to take place--and possibly the beginning of a civil war.I am a McCain-Palin supporter and many of my friends are Obama supporters. In all my discussions with them, they cannot tell me what Obama means by change. I tell them the change he is talking about is socialism.They are deaf and dumb about Obama. Facts do not have any room in their thought process. And any questions I bring up about Obama's association with Rev. Wright, Ayers, Acorn they put their hands over their ears.Civil War Two? Probably sooner than 2020."
2,Not this company's best,"The overall taste of this sauce was a disappointment to me. I love many of this company's products so I was a bit surprised that this chili paste didn't taste any better. There are bitter notes to this sauce which I attribute to chile seeds, vinegar and an excessive amount of salt. Buy some dry red pepper flakes and you'll eliminate the bitterness of this sauce but otherwise replicate it almost perfectly.I much prefer the Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. It is not only hotter but it has a wonderful sweetness to it combined with some pleasant garlic notes.This is a good company but not every one of its products hits the mark. This chili paste misses the mark by a wide margin in my view.The product label lists (in this order) chiles (with seeds), salt and then vinegar. The vinegar and salt add a lot of bitterness. As I said - I like this company's products but not this particular one. Salt and vinegar do NOT complement chiles that well in my view."
3,Contains Sodium Bisulfite,"I bought this after reading Opinunated's review of Sambal Oelek. In their review they listed ingredients from label but failed to list all ingredients. I thought I had finally found a chili paste that didn't have a bunch of preservatives. Unfortunately Sambal Oelek has a couple. Here is the entire ingredient list: ""Chili, Salt, Distilled Vinegar, Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Bisulite as preservatives and Xanthan Gum. CONTAINS SULPHITE (Sodium bisulfite)""."
5,Great Sauce!,"I LOVE this sauce. It is great on just about everything - I'm a hot sauce freak and cannot use sauces with garlic. This sauce fits the bill - hot and great taste! If you like hot, this is the sauce for you."
4,a small dissapointment...,"I bought this boots 3 months ago. They are light weighted and easy to wear them for many hours, but few days ago i wore them in an exercise with the unit where i had to cover a distance of 40 miles of rocky trail carrying full combat equipment, the threads at the middle at the left side of the right side opened wide at the end of the exercise... The good thing is the inner membrane is intact."
4,One of the best boots for less!!!,"These are not daily work boots but with extra kick when you need them the most. Whether you are in rain, snow or on desert these are the ones you really need. It can take the beating so its called Tactical!! There are many others that does the same thing but might be too pricy or cheaper but I like these and haven't had any problem lately. Chek it out you will not be disapointed"
3,Decent for the money...,"Rack mount brackets are crap...used some slightly longer sheet metal screws and tapped holes bigger, now they are on the unit sturdy. Reception is poor even with strong stations, bought an antenna that cost almost as much as the tuner itself which mostly resolved the problem. The antenna connector...my gosh, what were they thinking, I bought a little 3 dollar adapter from amazon to make it a screw on type...after I fixed all the engineering shortfalls it works great...they should have fixed it before they sold it. It is really just for background music anyway so it serves its purpose for that."
3,Cheap......,"Cheap stands.... They work, but the thumb knobs have broken on the back, that tighten the stand. Have had to leave the stands at their lowest height. When I get around to it I'll figure some way around to rig it. They are also unstable... But what do you expect for a light-weight stand like this... They do come with a good selection of stand hardware to hook up any sort of speaker...."
1,Plastic coating came ripped!,The plastic or rubber coating on the ends are there to protect your tub. The coating was so thin it was ripped in multiple spots when I took it out of the packaging. Very disappointing!
5,Great gift,My wife has already used it a bunch of times. The trick is to give some chocolate bath stuff and a magazine subscription.
2,Not perfect,"We had another bath caddy that broke and so we bought this to replace it. This is well made but unfortunately the book stand is very short and there wasnt a lip to hold the book open. We also tried a magazine that just slipped off if we wanted it to stay open. A heavy or tall book wont stand on it. For this reason, we returned it."
2,Not very practical,"Stand sits too low in normal-depth tub to allow enough clearance for all but small people. Works a little better with sliding side bars reversed downward into main tray such that the tray rises above the rim of the tub, but then there is nothing but the friction of the rubber sleeves from keeping the tray from dropping into the tub. Book stand doesn't adjust enough to accommodate comfortable reading while fully immersed. Book angle only works well when seated, not while laying down in tub. No mechanism for holding book open -- must have a hand on book at all times. In summary, it may work OK for someone quite small who doesn't want to read while laying down."
4,Bath Caddy,"This product worked as listed. The caddy seems to actually be larger than listed. Works great for books, but not magazines. Would recommend some type of bookmark to hold pages open."
4,Love it!,"I love this thing. OK, the accessories were not why I bought it, so I wont comment on those. The tray itself was slightly smaller than I expected, but extends over the edges of the jet tub without any problem. The adjustable book/magazine holder leaves a little to be desired as I cant quite adjust it to the angle I need as I recline in the tub. I have had this product for a few months now and I can still say I love it. I use it A LOT. It has no rust or wear that I can see, and it has been exposed to a lot of water, bubble bath and epsom salts. Be sure you pay attention to the dimensions or you may be surprised because it looks larger in the photo. I enjoy a plastic goblet of wine while I relax in the tub and this tray will hold two, and has room for a little plate of cheese and crackers for your partner....ok TMI. Buy it. Its worth it."
5,A Must Read!,"I loved Connally's book! I felt like I made a new friend reading her book and she articulated extremely well the things my single girlfriends and I struggle with and wrestle through. After reading the book, I felt like someone in the world understood me and I had renewed hope to keep making good choices.I agree with all the previous reviews that say this book is not just for women. I've already recommended it to three men."
5,Loving the Life I Didn't Expect,"Connally Gilliam has captured thoughts and feelings deep in the hearts and minds of many of the women living in the ""Four Bostons."" She has articulated things that felt too difficult or cumbersome or personal regarding the unexpected road of ""unintentional singleness"" in a way that is humorous, honest, and challenging! Thank you, Connally!"
5,great,The book arrived on time and just as described. I am enjoying it very much and got it for a great price!
2,Not Free SF Reader,"More inbreeding issues.A third novel in this series that is basically the same quality as the one preceding it, and adds little more to what is going on, or more of the same. Aliens remove breeding, then want to hybridise and cross-breed, and it turns out they may need some human breeding after all. DOH.Or, aliens can be stupid and make scientific mistakes when conquering, too.2 out of 5"
4,Not her best,But it was a nice ending to such a wonderful series. I loved the first book and had to read them all. Nothing compares to number 1 but this is pretty good.
3,Last in the trilogy,"Began midstream and ended abruptly. This is the third book in a series. I enjoyed all three books, but was disappointed in the ending."
2,Disappointing,"After the initial premise was developed, it was all downhill. At first I was enthralled, but sadly, it became boring."
5,I started this series backwards and it didn't matter,"I read this book before I read the other two even though this one came last. I didn't realize it was part of a series (the end part at that!) until I finished it and looked at the cover. Butler brought back things that happened in the other books without a terrible amount of exposition and a reader who didn't read the other two expects the world to be different anyway. I found this one to be more enjoyable than the first because there was no exposition, she assumed you knew what was happening because you read the other books but mentioned some things, like Akin's metamorphosis and Lilith's cancer to give it some continuity. I believe it is the mark of a great writer that someone can read the last book of a series and not even realize that it's part of a series. I don't think anyone could read a Harry Potter book after the first one without having that fact continually pounded over their head."
5,A very practical book,"I normally do not write reviews but when I noted a person said this book was for a 'housewife' and gave it one star I thought something was amiss. I found this book to be very practical, with numerous examples that show 'how to do it.' I purchased other books on this topic and found them to be filled with standards literature from the ITU. Thus, I was perplexed how someone could rate this book with one star when its significantly better that the others that spend most pages repeating ITU specifications."
1,book with over-promised contents,"In the summary of book's introduction, it looks like filling with lots new technologies, i.e. H.323, IP/ATM, and says to be suited for netowrk administrator, engineers. It's hard to believe only 4 or 5 pages can cover such topics. I strongly feel I am deceived. For entry level engineer or marketing persons, this book may be good. But for those engineering persons, I suggest you to forget this book."
1,This book is not for you unless you're a high-school student,"This book trys to use simple language to explain many complicated topics, and it fails to expain well. The author is knowledgable on telephone operations, but other than that, don't expect to learn anything from this book. I want to learn more about VOIP/ATM, H.323, CELP, but I feel very very disappointed after read through the whole book. If you're a design engineer, don't expect to learn angthing from it. If you're a high school student, or a household wife, this may be a good book."
3,Response to A Music Fan ..Northern CA,"This is a CD that reflects the mood of Mardi Gras in Acadiana..any of these are the songs you hear during Carnival..and you have to catch Zach at a show ""Down On Second Street"" in Lafayette to hear him perform these....Perhaps when listening you should consider..""Laisse-moi parler 'a ton coeur"""
1,Texas Short Sale Experts,A guide on how to take $$$ from others and profit from their demise. We still don't get it do we? Not at all impressed....proceed with caution
4,Love it! Love It! Love It!,"Love it! Love It! Love It! ""The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit"" by Thomas Lucier is very informative and a must read for anyone interested in this type of real estate investing. Mr. Lucier tells in detail how to negotiate with homeowners in trouble, how to be the solution to their problem, and how NOT to have the door slammed in your face. He also demystifies the process of dealing with the homeowner's lender by explaining in detail each step in the process of taking the property off their hands. This book, along with Dean Graziosi's [[ ASIN:1593154461 Be A Real Estate Millionaire: Secret Strategies for Lifetime Wealth Today]] have helped me so much in understanding how to be successful with foreclosures."
5,Very usable education,"Great book of Wisdom. Most importantly USABLE. Well written, no details left out on EXACTLY HOW to do each step.You can tell Thomas has ""been there, done that"". Unimagineable amount of professional resources that comes with the book."
4,A Great Step-by-Step Intro in Investing,"This is an excellent book by Thomas as he thoroughly takes you through the process of purchasing an investment property. He provides a wealth of resources on nearly every aspect of investing by listing websites and addresses.His forms are great for providing you with an idea for approaching home owners. However, the tone of the letters are some what dismissive--but that's just my opinion.The only area that needs enhancing is providing one with an idea as to estimate value in the property. He does not provide as much detail as others (i.e., Steve Berges ""The Complete Guide to Real Estate Finance for Investment Properties""). With that said, it is an excellent resource and I highly recommend it."
4,good overall information,"I am a very experienced investor (over 35 years in Real Estate Mortgages, Brokerage and appraising) and have purchased several properties at auction. This book does outline his program of acquiring properties before they go to sale. As possess are different in across the country, the book does apply broad principles. It is much more informative than similar books that just talk about past transactions. He does appear to have very practical experience which is more than I can say about other writers."
4,Strong elementary and intermediate advice,"OK, let's face it. Foreclosures in this country are going to be a serious issue in the next few years. And it will be no one's fault but the lenders who took on the added risk of investing in too many questionable loans, and the borrowers who had no idea what they were getting into.Having invested in these properties, and being a real estate sales agent with investors looking for such properties, the search processes Thomas Luccier suggests to find these properties are good. I have been using them and a few others for several years now. His foreclosure letters are powerful...perhaps too intimidating. The spreadsheets are great, I have actually replaced a couple of mine with his!Overall, I find the book usefull more so for a new investor, but valuable nonetheless even for experienced investors like myself. I'm sure I'll refer to it again in the future."
3,Hard to endure the poor writing style,"As other readers have said, this book contains quite a bit of useful information on picking up preforeclosure properties. However, Lucier's lousy writing style makes it pretty hard to get through the book. Even worse, his style sounds so uneducated that I lose confidence in what he has to say.Ultimately, I hope to make use of the information provided in the book, but if you buy it, be prepared to grit your teeth as you try to get past the writer's poor style."
5,Great book...read at least twice.,"After reading several books on real estate investing, I've found this one to be the most useful and easy to understand. The author explains why buying from the auction may not be the best approach and can easily lead to overpaying for a property. The author provides a pragmatic step-by-step gameplan to succeeding in this business. I feel comfortable, knowledgeable, and confident to make my first pre-foreclosure property investment."
1,Dated and illogical,"I took this book out from my local library. I cannot figure the motivation for someone with equity in their home to sell that equity for nothing; accrued equity is one of the greatest advantages to purchasing property. This approach also does not take into account the potential for home values to plummet, as we saw recently. A better question an investor might want to ask themselves is why the homeowner is unable to sell their home despite the equity they've built up, and if it is realy an investment at all. Like many methods that supposedly beat the market, this one will not last the test of time."
5,Informative and a fast read,I enjoyed this book very much and finished the entire book in just a couple of days. This will go on my shelf as a reference book over the years and looking forward to starting my hobby and hopefully career of investing after a bit more studying!
3,Dated??,"I bought this book to understand purchasing short sales and foreclosures at B&N full price. To the end of describing the process it was useful. The book was published in 2004 and it is very different post boom. The author offers free communication via e-mail or phone but both phone and server are disconnected when checked in 2012. Realtors, loan officers, appraisers, etc offer current and conflicting information. Not unexpected as real estate forecast involve the average of 18 economist that vary from -10% to +10% this year! Commonsense and not the promise of tomorrow will serve you well."
5,Well Worth It,"This book provided me with the information I needed. It includes samples of a Purchase Agreement designed for this type of transaction, information release letters, and other helpful forms and worksheets. These documents are all downloadable at no additional cost from the author's website. The Purchase Agreement serves as a first draft to take to your local real estate lawyer (to be adapted for the State in which the property is located). The author explains his methods in a step-by-step fashion. Live consultation with him is also available at a reasonable cost. I've done that too, and he was most helpful."
5,The Crown Jewel,"One of my investors advised me that a property owner approached him with an opportunity to purchase his property for the balance of the loan.The remaining balance of the loan was much higher than the value of the home on the market, so the investor told the owner he was not interested. The investor relayed this information to me, so I decided to look for a resource that would assist me in conducting a preforeclosure(short-sale)transaction.I purchased Tom's book for one chapter-Chapter 16.After reading the chapter, I put his information to good use.In November of last year, I initiated the process and in February 2006, I closed on the deal.I can't wait to apply Tom's techniques described in the rest of the book. A must read for realtors and/or investors alike."
5,Highly Recommend,"I have used Thomas' approach and it works. The book is well laid out, concise and to the point. It provides a wealth of information and templates, making it a great reference. It also spends a fair amount of time on ethical standards, an element dreadfully lacking with many investors. If you want a book that's going to hype you up and tell you that you are going to make millions in your first year, don't get this. If you want a book that provides a realistic and methodical approach to buying foreclosures, then this book is for you."
5,Great Book,"Very well written and organized book, Packed with great material. Most so called Real Estate guru's would charge many times the price for this book and give the same material. I also emailed him a couple of questions of which he emailed a response right back immediately."
5,Great book for the beginner investor,"When I picked up this book I went from knowing very little about the pre-foreclosure market to having a base of knowledge to a begin a new career. I have read a couple other books that give great advise, but Lucier's book is step by step how-to's that the beginner needs to know."
4,A good meat and potatoes book on Preforeclosures,"I found this book to be very useful. It applies well to Preforeclosures overall nationwide and is especially useful if your are in Florida. He does not add fluff, or hype to this book. I would also recommend ""How to be a Quick Turn Real Estate Millionaire"" by Ron LeGrand as far as how to find leads (cheap marketing)and wholesaling. These are both books you should have in your Real Estate Investing Library! The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit should be a reference handbook for serious investors![...]"
1,Useless to me,"I bought this from Canada. I was naive enough to think the contents applied here. But it deals with US laws and real estate only. Therefore it should not have been made available to non US citizens, OR should have been labelled as ""For US market only"" or words to that effect. Very likely to be fine if you are a US citizen though. But if you're not American, beware! With transportation, that's over $40 wasted."
5,Outstanding book. Tons of information in one book.,"If I would have known about this book when it first came out, I would have saved, literally, 10's of thousands of dollars. I have purchased a lot of guru's courses, and nothing comes close to this book. A step by step guide from start to finish. Tells you like it is with no fluff. Thanks for the information."
5,Good book,This book gives step-by-step instructions on how to buy the Pre-foreclose property.Best thing about this book is the downloadable forms which can be modified to suite your needs.
5,There isn't a BETTER Resource out there today!,"I am new in the real estate investing arena, and like most had to read 5-6 books to find this 1 Amazing resource. Mr. Lucier lays it out, and holds nothing back. Yes, he really does reply to emails AWESOME!!! If your serious about investing and have the means to do so then this book is one you'll want to carry with you everywhere!"
3,Wasn't Bad,"I will honestly say I enjoy the books by Peter Conti, William Bronchick and Wendy Patton a lot better (just easier to read I suppose). I do like this book because it has a lot of scripts and sample contracts and he tells the honest truth about things. I also like the fact you can contact the owner. I do wish he would put out a more up to date book (I wish everyone would.I think everyone should have this book in their collection it's a great dose of reality mixed with a little humor and tons of personal experience."
3,What to avoid,"The reading for this book seems like it's more for somebody who has already done foreclosures a few times and the book more tells you what to avoid.The big technique theory behind the book is sending letters that he has, but what if two people buy this book from the same area, but what if two people buy this book or other books and do the exact same thing. Honestly, I've never purchased a pre-foreclosure before, but this book will have you more scared than anything else of what could go wrong instead of what could go right."
5,Tom Lucier Answered my question within 24 hours,Wow! I just purchased Tom's book and was very impressed with the step by step instructions. I even had a question about selling pre-foreclosures and recieved a reply back within 24 hours. His response back to me probably saved me thousands of dollars. Great tool for the new investor and straight talk for the seasoned investor. Thanks Tom
2,General intro,"Thought the book is agood general introduction, I would recommend a more hands on approach, written many years ago (so ignore the house prices which were wayyy lower back then)a classic by Bill Greene >>>Distress Property How to Buy It in California(don't let the California in the title scare you offf, basic principles apply anywhere; he just includes addresses of state govt agencies in CA)"
2,concerened consumer,Not only is the bag bad but as a person less then 250 pounds when i sat in it the first time it bent. I tried to bend it back and it rebent. I feel it may not be safe!!
3,Get what you pay for,"I have several of these for tailgating parties and have encountered both the 'bag tearing' and the 'leg bending' problems mentioned by the other readers. I just have written such off to the low price of each chair. If we weren't so tough on them, I'm sure they'd last longer. Overall, they are a good deal for the money."
3,Ok for the price,"it was a good little chair for while, but after awhile the fabric rips and the chair breaks."
2,concerened consumer,I way alot less the 250 pounds and when I got a simaler product and used it it bent.
1,Don't waste your money....,"Different paperweight, same seller: I ordered 3 of these from this seller. They came defective. Each of the dahlia pictures had flaws/defective markings. It looked like a crease in the picture or a depression made from to much pressure. The quality just wasn't there & I just couldn't give them as gifts as planned. I contacted the seller & shared this with them. They would not provide me with a postage paid return label to send them back & really didn't seem to care that they sent me defective items. There just wasn't customer service offered. I bought it, they have their money & whatever, not their problem. I began researching their reviews & found this was normal for them. I wish I had never made this purchase. I am out even more by having to pay for my own return shipping on these defective paperweights to get a refund & this is money I really don't have to spend. I would never purchase from them again & I hope you don't have the same experience I have had."
3,A trip in the natural pockets left within suburban sprawl.,"Pyle grew up near an irrigation canal running through Denver and Aurora, Colorado. He has returned to this canal throughout his life, and in this book he tells their stories. Urbanization leaves these pockets of unclaimed land behind, and this book is a durable guide to one example. Coloradans will find Pyle's work especially relevant.At times, the author strays into a didactic zeal as he warns of the need to protect such places, but this is by far the lesser part of The Thunder Tree."
5,Necessary product for small children,Fits the Mountain boy wagon / sled perfectly and a very necessary item for small children. Well made and soft. Seems to be durable and the ties fit well on the wagon or sled.
5,"Another ""hidden gem"" that radio ingnores!","This album is great! It's weird, but I was listening to [an album] and saw Van Hunt listed in the credits. I received and advanced copy of VH and found what I was looking for, sweet soul music, creative and authentic, punctuated with fine musicianship. This is an anytime album, riding, chillin', groovin, lovin! I work in the radio biz, and it's a shame that the corporate suits calling the shots have lost touch with what music is really all about: a talented artist at his/her best. I'll do my best to spread the word about this wonderful album. I haven't felt this comfortable with an ""ignored"" cd (...) If you're looking for r&b with catchy hooks, beats, samples and sex, this is not the cd for you. If you're looking for an ""album"" that reaches to the depths of what authentic soul MUSIC is all about, go get Van Hunt.........NOW!"
5,Bumpin,"I spent much of my time at the beginning of the cd listening to ""Down here in hell"" and ""What can I say"" over and over again. When I finally made it through to the end, I came across ""Precious"" which is my number one. Rest of the cd is decent. Definitely worth the purchase.Big A in the Hiz-A"
3,Solid neo soul - hard hitting originals and softer homages,"Very promising debut in the watered down neo soul genre. Although some of these tracks show the more generic characteristics of the genre, songs like ""dust"" and ""hold my hand"" take new, interestingly done directions which Van Hunt wears very well. That's not to say that some of the more traditional compositions are poor, oftentimes they are quality-however the general direction on the album does feel a bit contrived and derivative in the face of the more unique material, particularly in the ballad department, which oftentimes seem wrapped up in a tidy little singer songwriter sort of way. However when the spontaneous, subtle rock/funk/electronic hybrids gel, you should definitely feel the difference."
3,Work in progress,"This is the purchase to make me stop being influenced by the reviews I see on Amazon. The voals were adequate but not excellent. The music was typical but not classic. The lyrics were his saving grace, clever and thoughtful. Maybe next album he can bring his weak areas up to that level. But he's not the next D'Angelo, Maxwell, or anything of the like. He's a work in progress."
2,Don't become another cog in the hype machine,"Average vocals, average arrangements, average artist. This guy is getting way too much buzz. I think that people are so desparate for a male R&B singer that anyone who is remotely credible gets attention. If you want formula R&B, I suggest you buy an R. Kelly cd. At least his arrangements are remotely interesting and original."
2,Not as good as I expected.,"I saw Van Hunt on a late night show recently (?Greg Kilborn?)and he performed the single ""Dust"" and it was jammin. The CD version wasn't as good as the live version he performed on TV, it seemed to be lacking some instruments or some kick or something. And sadly I think ""Dust"" is the best cut on the CD. No slam on Van Hunt, he seems talented I just don't think this CD is that great."
5,It's nice to hear some good R&B for a change,"I'm a real big fan of older R&B; and music... The problem isthat over the last several years the genre has become allabout money just like rock music has. However, here we havean exceptional talent that doesn't feel he needs to promotedrugs or hip hop chicks to be effective. This guy remindsme alot of a Prince.... His voice seems alittle bit aliketo me and that is not a bad thing at all. There really isnot a bad track here.... It's all smooth and it's greatrelax music. If you are tired of the repetitive R&B; genreand are looking for a new sound I suggest giving Van Hunta try because you will not regret it."
5,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the next soul classic","Van Hunt - Van Hunt (Capitol, 2004)With virtually no promotion at all from his label (who also has Javier on their roster with another unpromoted album), don't expect Van Hunt's album to fly off the shelves just yet. But for the people who have checked him out on Conan or heard ""Seconds of Pleasure"" on the radio, you're in for a treat. Although this man is another one of those ""produced by, arranged by, performed by, thought of by, etc., etc.,...himself"" artists, he delivers the goods on here. ""Anything"", ""Her December"", ""Dust"", hell, the whole album is great. I had to ""retire"" Anthony Hamilton's Comin' From Where I'm From just to give this album heavy rotation. Get this album today--no, get this album yesterday. -EJR"
5,"Cool Beats, Original Lyrics, Very Good","This album really stands out compared to the type of RnB music played on the radio. From first listen my ears perked up and I couldn't help but pay attention to what Van Hunt was saying and his music. Unfortunately I don't think we'll be hearing much of Van Hunt on the radio - this music is too artistic to gain wide popularity. You, however, will be glad to have discovered it. I'm already looking forward to the next album!"
4,Wonderful Soul Music,"This is an excellent debut from Van Hunt, who i heard penned Dione Farris' hit song ""Hopeless"" on the Love Jones Soundtrack. The lyrics are beautiful and expressive, the music and instruments evoke that old soul feeling, but with a modern edge ... and the production does not overwhelm. I am glad i bought this album, and havent stopped listening to it since i got it."
4,A Bright Future Ahead,"Van Hunt is a very talented artist. He writes, composes and produces for himself and others. My favorite songs are Hello Goodbye, Down Here in Hell With You, Hold My Hand (early 80's Prince vibe), & Out of the Sky. This cd covers a little bit of jazz, pop/rock, r&b, and blues. I wish mainstream R&B radio stations would play more artists like Van Hunt. A solid debut from a talented musician."
5,Still Revealing Truths Decades Later,"Steinbeck's travels across the country with Charley the dog reveal a lot about human nature, self-discovery, attitudes and opinions of the ""everyman"", and so much more. Each chapter is a super focused slice that tells the truth and lies at the same time, while both romanticizing and bringing to solid-ground America and Americans. An absolute must read for Americans of all walks."
5,A wonderful read,"I purchased this book for my grandmother and after she read it she loaned it to me. It's an excellent read, even if you have never read Steinbeck before, and very humorous and entertaining. I doubt it will appeal much to an under 30 crowd but if you like to read about an already popular author reflecting on life, offering up his view of Americana during the 1960's with a critical eye toward racism, then this book is definitely for you. Charley and his truck are additional ""characters"" to this book, each with their own personality and quirks, and this camraderie keeps Steinbeck's narrative rolling along."
4,Intimate portrait of a great writer...,"What makes this book so special to me is that I feel I am close to one of the great writers of all time. Sometimes the book seems (and of course, it is) dated, sometimes it seems visionary. But most of all, it is warm and touching and the writer's obvious love of his dog is particularly dear. It makes a ""great"" man quite human, although it is amusing to note that Kerouac's ""On The Road"" is a far-superior book - a truly great work. Steinbeck's fiction is much better than this travelog, but still, it's a joy to read and I feel like I really got to know him as a friend."
2,Not very exciting!,"...With his French poodle dog Charley, John Steinbeck set out in his truck Rocinante to explore and experience America at the age of 58. He meets a lot of different people on his way across the nation. What follows is an account of the places he goes and the people he meets during he's three-month journey. In he's journey john was not happy with most of the big American cities for example Chicago and Texas as having problems of people not being very friendly compare to the American villages. He was also appalled by racism in new Orleans.I like the description he gave of Maine and New England in general in 60's. It has not really changed, most of the things he talked about or saw are still around.My view of the book is that it is not exciting at all, it is too plain!. It does not cause any curiosity to the reader."
2,"a basic review of Travels With Charley, by John Steinbeck.","John Seinbeck, the author of Travels With Charley, has set out on a journey. His mission is to find out more about the American people. Although he wrote about them, he felt he didn't know enough about them. The book shows how the average life of someone in California would be compared to the average life of someone living in New Hampshire. With Charley, his faithful dog, by his side, he seemed to feel very comfortable meeting people of high and low financial status, people from his very own home town and people from places he had never visited before. Although the story seems to bore the reader often, a lot of information about the American people can be fofound out by simply reading this tale of America."
5,A wonderful longing....,"As Steinbeck would tell us, as Americans we all have that sort of longing for the road and to travel our great country. In my opinion, it is becoming a lost love, however, in the age of speed.And so, this book was like a vacation for me. I read it over the space of about a week and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would compare it to William Least Heat Moon's *Blue Highways* although it is a bit different. Both men are intellects and both lend their insight and thoughts as to their experiences and their spiritual journey's and neither lets us down.I loved the book because it gave me a light-hearted reprieve from our everyday duties in life....work, laundry, bills, work, dishes, bills, work, carwashing, groceries, work--and it brought me back to the realization that in many ways we are our own worse enemies....nothing really has to be so hard. In a way, everything is relative.Highly recommended."
4,I wanted more,"This is a real trip of John and his poodle. I really got interested as he made it to Montana, and what got to me was how inspired he was by the terrain. He was hooked. But then his dog needed veterinary care and he sped across to Seattle. What happened to Montana and the people he was attracted to! That was the only let-down. I read this book two years ago on a whim (I travel with my dog Sara a lot) and ever since I have been lured to see Montana. And all because I read this book."
5,If I Had One Book on a Deserted Island...,"This is one of the best, most enjoyable books ever written, in my opinion. It is a combination history (of a now by-gone America), essay (on what it means to be American, on the coming modern world, on racism, on travel, even on what the mind of a dog may be thinking), memoir, history, travelogue and poem. Steinbeck sets off with his dog Charley in a glorified pickup truck to see America in 1960. He explores as many themes along the way as he does landscapes and states. He meets people, he offers opinions, he converses with his pal Charley, and he offers a comment on America - past, present, and future. I find this a fascinating, thoroughly enjoyable (and I'd even say ""classic"") read. And I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to reflect on America and travel with Charley and the great author who drove him around. For those familiar with John Steinbeck only as a writer of fiction, this book reveals a new side, and one I think you will enjoy."
2,Formatting Review,"I'm giving Travels w/ Charley two stars because at least there aren't any typos, and there are very few hyphenated words appearing in the middle of sentences.The problem with TWC is that all the white space between text sections has been removed (rather, overlooked), but the non-indent of the new opening paragraph remains. What that means for the reader is confusion as the chapters are a collection of non sequiturs.Conclusion: Sloppy (even contemptuous) text to Kindle conversion."
5,Must Read,"One of my top 5 books of all time. You can pick it up and start reading from anywhere. The people he meets on the road, the observations from the era, and the development of every scene makes this worth every re-read. Put it in your library."
4,Good book to understand USA for an european,After my own travel through USA I red Steinbekc's book. It has given me the oportunity to understand a lot of your spirit. His openminded vision is one I have not seen so often over your interesting nation
5,Me review Steinbeck?,This is one of his best works. Read it at the suggestion of the Pres. of the New School and I'm grateful he did. I'll leave it at that.
4,can't get much better than a Steinbeck,"Steinbeck's Travels with Charley was his last book I believe. This is a memoir of John Steinbeck's drive from Long Island, New York to the tip of Maine to California and back to Long Island. Of course it's well written, as you'd expect from any Nobel Prize winner in Literature, but it also captures that turbulent time in the early 1960s when Martin Luther King Jr. was trying to achieve Civil Rights and Khrushchev was banging his shoe in the United Nations."
5,Travels with the best,"I had read most of Steinbeck's books as a child or young adult, but somehow overlooked ""Travels with Charley"" until this summer. The best thing about this book is the insights into Steinbeck's own character; his intelligence and humanity shine through every chapter. Steinbeck also went out of his way to witness and describe a particularly shameful episode of racism in New Orleans -- (...). His heartsickness over this incident and over the country's struggle with racism in general is as moving as anything I've read on the subject. Anyone who enjoys road trips will identify with this episodic journal and be charmed by Steinbeck's timeless wit and wisdom."
1,"Man and dog, doing little. Add a lot of wit- still only one star.","Steinbeck can really write well, I just wish hadn't been so indulgent to think he should share such a boring trip."
2,Boring! Too much details. NOT RECCOMENED!,"All throughout this book, John Steinbeck babbles on about his trip. It's very boring. Basically: HE loves Montana Hates change Hates racism Hate Society Gross book don't read..............."
2,In part disappointing but not entirely so.,"Considering Steinbeck's undoubted and deserved reputation as one of America's greatest writers, some parts of the book are disappointing. Of course it is basically a travel diary and the descriptions of the towns, the people and the events Steinbeck meets along the way are such as many of us would include, probably in similar style in our own travel diaries. However there are two major exceptions to the above. First, Steinbeck's description of his desparate search for veterinary relief for his dog Charley when he gets ill. And second: his heart-rending description of the scenes he witnesses in segregated 1960's New Orleans, involving the women (""Cheerleaders"") and their abusive treatment of a little black girl and her single white escort on her way to school. All too true historically, if impossible to imagine, some fifty years later."
3,An interesting evaluation of some people in the USA,"Not overly impressed with his writing. The story breaks down after leaving Texas, so, what about the other half os the east coast."
4,Just as Good Second Time,"I love Steinbeck and this was my second reading of ""Charley"". I enjoyed again Steinbeck's observations and way with words."
5,bucket list journey,"It was enjoyable to read well written prose.Steinback is capable of insightful, uplifting, light hearted perspectives, a welcome relieffrom Grapes of Wrath et al.I read it on a ""bucket list"" trip, now journey, to Alaska. For the first time in a long time,I was never lost!"
4,Steinbeck's Timeless Piece That Says It All,"Charlie (Steinbeck's dog) serves a his ""Sanch Panza."" The two of them take a long trip on the ""backroads"" of our nation. Stienbeck is one of the few authors that can describe soemthing with but a couple of words: ""Fly Paper Youth,"" ""Star-rattled sky."" This type of ability makes Steinbeck among the best Amercian authors ever. Travel with Charlie is no exception. Many of Steinbeck's details have stayed with me months and even years after reading his books. That to me is impressive. The musings of a wise and caring quthor as he relates to a country he thought he knew."
5,"Like an American ""Heart of Darkness""","I really liked this book. Strangely I went into it thinking it to be a travelogue of places and things but it's much, much more. He journeys into the soul of America. His observations are still valid and universal. To this day he's right on about Texas and Seattle. His comments about growth in Seattle could have been taken from todays newspaper. My favorite is (paraphrased) - why is it so often that progress looks like destruction. I have one question if anyone can help - I didn't follow the ""Ci Git"" piece."
3,Discover america and it's people,"John Stienbeck takes us on a trip across the United States and gives us an intimate look at what the U.S. and it's people are like. Over all I enjoyed the book, only to be left feeling a bit resentful because of Stienbeck's use of ""Wet Backs"" when he refers to Mexican people. Stienbeck's recolections of his dog (Charlie) during this trip is a times humorous and makes one smile and feel good about the bond formed between man and his most loyal friend"
4,"Good book with a few great moments, and some questionable ones","Travels with Charley is one of Steinbeck's better books, though several of the incidents he ""reports""(?) bear a suspicious resemblance to episodes from some of his novels. Personally, the parts I enjoyed the most were those about his eponymous traveling companion Charley, an elderly French poodle, and I wish there had been more of them. I'm not sure that Steinbeck managed to learn or convey much that was very meaningful about America, but his description of his sojourn through New Orleans near the end to witness the protests against desegregation as six-year-old Ruby Bridges became the first black child to attend a white grade school (immortalized in Norman Rockwell's painting ""The Problem We All Live With"") is quite interesting, even moving. On the whole, despite some problems (including its dubious veracity in places), definitely worth a read. Three and a half stars."
1,Travels With Charley: In Search of America,I found this book very boring and unintesting. I love reading books by Steinbeck but it seems that he gave up when he wrote this one. There was no excitement and it just seem tiring just looking at it. I would not recommend anyone to read this book.
3,"A Good Start, But The Trip Starts to Wear On You After Awhile","I enjoyed the first half of this memoir, but then lost interest after Montana. Steinbeck does has some spot-on observations. I especially liked his view on antiques. Recommended."
5,the book that many of us dream of writing,"As with many of the readers listed here, this is my favorite Steinbeck story. I had this book with me when I moved from Michigan to Arizona(and back),thinking I was making a feeble attempt and his story. Any American with a car and a wanderlust should read this, on the road of course! It was hard not to feel envious of the author during this tale of route '66-ing."
3,Not entertaining.,"It started off nice, but then the bordom sat in. I was required to read this to pass an english class and didn't see the literary merit to it. Steinbeck wrote in an easy to understand manner and added some humor (in my opinion) on how people act. It was a book that was well written, but really should have been shorter."
3,Lucky Poodle,"I wish my master would take me on some journeys like this! The farthest he takes me is to the corner liquor store, which is cool because I get to see this really cute Yorkshire Terrier along the way."
1,Awful Quality,"I read this book as a young man and looked forward to re-reading it as an old man. I was excited to get it, but when I opened the package and saw this crummy little book I felt totally ripped off. This thing looks like a grade school reader, not a hard-cover book that you would want to put on a shelf. It is a total rip off. I refuse to pay this much money for garbage quality."
1,Disappointing,"Steinbeck took a skim across America to find new places and people to DRINK with.... Then filled more boring pages with ego, which he had to highlight with descriptions of where/how his dog urinated on things."
1,Authors should retire too,"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!Steinbeck has reinvented himself in this work as a pretentious bore. Was this the man who wrote East of Eden? Hardly seems possible.This Steinbeck comes across as a pseudo intellectual who names his truck after Don Quixote's horse seems unaware that the New York license plates on the truck will influence what people think of him.He spends time between boring observations inserting a combination of Hemingway toughness and sophomoric intellectual ""name dropping"".I am sorry after 100 pages I quit...most of his insights were wrong and the few that were good weren't worth the pain."
1,torture!!,"This book is painful to read because you are hosted by a crotchety old man who is annoyed by life and loves no one except his dog. He meets people who he finds boring and visits places that insult him and tells you about all of the lousy things that happen to him and then reminds you of all of the good things that have disappeared about America. If you love Steinbeck don't read this book because perhaps you are meeting the real man and you will feel different about his other beautiful books. If you don't know Steinbeck and want to, try Pastures of Heaven or Cannery Row. Those books are how you want to remember him by, and not by this last, wheezing gasp."
1,Awful!!!,"In this rather short novel, Steinbeck tells the reader about the most memorable parts of his cross-country trip with his dog. Unfortunately, these memorable moments are among the most boring narratives that I have ever read! Steinbeck wastes half of the book on an in-depth study of what his French poodle, Charley, prefers to urinate on, a topic that I personally do not care about at all.Ultimately, I think that had this novel been written in the Middle Ages, it would have quickly replaced the rack as a popular torture method."
4,knidos,This dictionary and the other companion collins english-greek helped me improve my greek knowledge.Recommendable.However I advise the greek language lovers to visit 'www.books-in-greek.gr' to find more sophisticated greek dictionaries and other useful items for building up their capacity.
3,For what it was it was cool,I enjoyed this one. I felt there should have been more blood and gore. But it was a cool new direction to take the movie.
5,As timely now as when released...,"This film is a must-see for those who have power over war and peace. Think about it - the peace treaty is about to be torpedoed by high ranking officers of both the Klingon Empire and the Federation, who stand to lose big time if peace ever breaks out.Is there any similarity to the present Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Looks like it... Especially since, every single time there is a chance for peace, some new attack on the part of anyone over there derails whatever progress is made. Almost seems like the rogue Federation and Klingon officers of this film. But I digress...This picture is a huge credit to the filmakers of the Star Trek saga, just when it was most needed (after the disaster that was Star Trek V). If you are interested in serious science fiction, toelrance between cultures or are in the mood for a good thriller, watch this one. If you live in the Middle East, by all means watch this one!"
4,FYI - no booklet is enclosed,"I was all set to return this disc when I opened it due to the lack of a booklet/chapter listing. It turns out Paramount did not include one in this package, apparently to cut costs.Paramount is also releasing all six of these Trek movie special editions in a box set. It's too bad they don't offer a way for collectors to purchase the actual empty box itself to house their set in."
4,"Undiscovered Country is ""Tom Clancy Star Trek""","The Undiscovered Country is an exciting and intellegent political thriller/mystery which will entertain fans and non-fans alike. Taking cues from Tom Clancy, the plot involves the assasination of the Klingon Chancellor on the eve of a peace summitt. When Kirk and the Enterprise crew are held responsable for the crime, they must race against time to discover what is happening and who is at the heart of a galactic conspiracy before war consumes both governments.This is one of the more serious Trek films, with not as many ""fun"" moments as the others, and it does move slowly in some places. The plot is intriguing and well structured, but doesn't hold up as well in repeat viewings. The climactic sequences are very well done. Overall, the f/x are above average and the sound (especially on DVD) is great. The two trailers on the DVD are worth the whole thing! Overall this is a great film with a great guest cast."
3,At least the DVD works...,I guess you get what you pay for. I expected to get a the Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition packaging (the dvd box is a special two disc case) when I ordered this but what I got was the two disc set in a cheap recycled blockbuster case with the original sleeve insert cut down to fit inside the slimmer case. If you've bought the other Special Collector editions you know the dvd case is different. At least the DVD's work.
4,Classic Star Trek movie!!,"One of my favorite original Star Trek movies. I am a Star Trek fan and must say I still think this is one of William Shatner's best movies. I'm thinking about ordering Star Trek Generations next. I'm not to big on the new Star Trek movie since when I watched it I was missing my old cast, although Spock was in it. Overall a very decent original classic of Star Trek."
5,What They Leave Behind,"A fitting swan song to the original series crew,which bridges many event that shows up on subsequent series(The Khitomer Accords,Klingon Honor,etc).The film gives our aged but beloved heroes a send-off that couldn't even be cheapened by Generations token TOS apperance.Its mix of action,suspense,and even mystery makes this a very entertaining film.The return to the directors chair of Nick Meyers is a godsend(attn Rick Berman,Hire Mr Meyers for Star Trek X).As Capt. Sulu of the Excelsior fittenly puts it,""Nice to see you in action,one more time."""
4,Nice,"I bought this to complete my set of the Special Edition DVDs. At first, I was a little bummed at the lack of any kind of booklet or documentation or the upside down Enterprise on the Disc 2 label.Then I watched the movie with the audio & text commentaries on. Great picture, pretty entertaining commentaries, although not as informative as TMP or TWOK.The other extras sealed the deal. Next to TMP, this is the 2nd best of the lot. And the booklets they've been putting in these have gone downhill since the first one, it was just a matter of time. I hear they're releasing Generations without a case."
4,Stop tricking us into windescreen!,"The picture is nice and crispy and the extras are good. Nice tribute to late Deforest Kelly. Unfortunately the 2,35:1 picture is not 2,35:1 but 1,85:1. Can anyone explain why? Maybe they opened up the matte 'cause it was shot in Super 35. Is that it? They are not cutting anythong on the sides, right?Victor from Portugal"
4,"Better than I remembered it, but what's the deal with...?","I remember seeing this in the cinemas back when it came out, and I thought it was OK. After watching it twice on DVD now (listening to the director's and writer's commentaries), I found it even more enjoyable, proof that the ST movies with the original cast and crew are still better than those that followed them. A good addition to my ST collection. A couple of questions to other fans out there: did your copy of this DVD come without a printed chapter index (insert)? and why is the picture printed on disc two an upside down still picture of the Enterprise-B (from ""ST: Generations"", not from ST VI)? Or did I get a misprinted disc? The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because Mike Okuda's text commentary was sparse at best, not much to learn when fans want so much to know..."
5,Fabulously Great,"Just want to say that it's great to finally have my favorite part of the star trek legacy available in DVD format with the extra features. I have been a fan of (TOS) (TNG) (DS9), as well as the feature length movies, and can say this is one of my favorite installments, so in general i am just saying Good job"
2,"Ok, but not great","I looked forward to this film before it came out in theatres since Star Trek V was so horrible, alas this effort is only so-so. The character interactions were good, I liked that part. What I didn't like was the silly whodunnit storyline that was too predictable anyway. It had so many holes. For instance on the prison planet, why not just shoot Spock and McCoy right away? Why set up this elaborate scheme with Iman's character and then surround them? I mean, what if they managed to escape? Which they did by the way.Also, why didn't the bioscanner on the transporter pick up the klingon blood that the two shooters had on their boots when they reenergized? How did they manage to beam out without the bridge knowing about it? These were some of the little things to be sure, but they really add up in this movie.A very disappointing movie. I guess Star Trek I & IV will be the only installments with the original crew that I enjoyed."
1,Booklet NOT included!!!!!!! Paramount execs are tightwads.,"Just when you thought Paramount was coming around and being nice...they find a way to stick it to the ever faithful Star Trek fans who support the franchise and the undeserving pocketbooks of the Paramount executives.After ""re""-releasing all 5 movies in its ""special edition"" format after making the public buy all the movies in its regular ""no extras"" format, the executives in an effort to ""save costs"" decide to skimp out on the booklet. Booklets which which accompanied the previous five special edition releases!So after all that the executives manages to screw the loyal fans once again -- enough to make one FUME with rage.That's not to down grade the movie -- which is exceptional due to Nick Meyer's direction. Mr. Meyer, if you read this I hope you give the TIGHTWAD Paramount execs a piece of your mind on our behalf."
2,"Predictable, mediocre, unimaginative","I don't understand why everyone likes this movie so much. There is nothing special about it. It is predictable, has a wooden plot, and runs like a standard TV episode of virtually any action TV show. There is no imagination, depth, or creativity in it. It's just a simple shallow drama. Nothing stands out from it. I have no idea what the rest here is seeing. It doesn't compare at all with any of the other Star Trek movies. Even Star Trek V is better than this."
1,The BOXed set to include the booklet for the sixth movie.,"Have you ever purchased a MAJOR movie release which doesnt have a booklet or atleast a token insert? Probably, NOT. Except the executives at Paramount feel they can get away with it by short- changing the person most likely to loyally purchase the sixth installment of the Star Trek movies === the Star Trek fan.You would think, that as the last movie with all the original cast that they would perhaps have included a commemorative signoff booklet or something.Preying on the Star Trek fan's desire to have a ""complete set"",Paramount is going to release all six movies as a boxed set which more than likely is going to include extras forcing the loyal fan to purchase (for the third time) all six movies again because this set WILL include that ever elusive booklet."
2,"Unfortunately, a lot of boring talking heads","In my opinion, this is the worst ST movie. Apart from the effects, ST V was better.ST VI was extremely long, involved lots of ""commentary"" dialogue (where the writer seemed to be extrememly concerned that we all think him well-read and intelligent), and not much plot movement.It would have made a better episode, with some tight editing,The best part of the movie is the last 15 minutes when the incredibly obvious ""secret plot"" is finally revealed, and the Enterprise shoots the modified photon torpedo at the ""To be or not to be"" captain.Don't waste your money, unless you HAVE to have the whole collection. ST V is funnier. The Voyage Home (IV) is the best."
3,Bring back the theatrical version!,"The video and DVD versions of this film are NOT the same as was seen in the theatres. Several minutes of footage were added that significantly altered the film, especially it's ending. It is NOT a Director's cut. It was probably done to assuage a cast member of the ""Deep Space 9"" TV series, whose contributions to this film had ended up on the cutting room floor. The original (better) version should have been available on this disc."
3,A captivating movie.,"When I made my friend, who does not like Star Trek at all,watch this film it blew him away. He found this movie, as I did a great film. Christopher Plummer plays a perfect villan, and the rest of the cast does a great job too. It ends in a great battle, and has very few flaws in the script. This is one good film, and I would tell anyone, Star Trek fan or not to watch this. If they didn't they would be missing out on a terrific movie."
2,Paramount Doesn't Fail to Disappoint...Again!,"Again, Paramount fails to bring us ""TREK"" in DVD quality. Just like Generations, the quality of picture was well below that of most ""re-mastered for DVD"" movies. Although the sound quality was great, it still didn't make up for the ""VHS"" picture quality. I liked the story a lot, and I enjoyed watching it in the theaters, but on DVD this is average at best. Again, no special features except for the 2 movie trailers. I hope Paramount gets the message that we want the movies to be ""re-mastered"" for DVD and will pay for it."
3,Mayer does worse than Shatner,"I feel this movie left some questions unanswered. Exactly what information in the ship's computer said that the shots were fired from the Enterprise? Although the scenes with the floating Klingon blood were impressive, I had always believed that phasers, when making a penetrating wound, cauterized that wound (remember the close-ups of smoking holes in uniforms?). So why, in this movie, do we have wounds that were not cauterized? Nicholas Mayer did superbly well in Wrath of Khan. But I feel that in this movie he did even worse than Shatner in Final Frontier."
3,Atrocious packaging,Many others have written about the Film and extras itself so I will leave that to them.Paramount really dropped the ball on this one. The DVD are arranged in such a way that at least one of them could very easily get scratched. On top of that for whatever reason they decided not to includea booklet like they did with all the other Star Trek Special Edition series.I am really disapointed with Paramount over this. I am very lucky my copy did not arive damaged.
4,Great movie...good DVD,"ST6 is a great movie. This DVD presentation from Paramount Home Video doesn't quite measure up to the original material. The Super 35 image (2.35:1 theatrically) has been cropped to about 2:1 (the same transfer used for the laserdisc), but the picture fares fairly well. The REAL discovery here, though, is the Dolby Digital soundtrack. ST6 has never sounded THIS good--even in the theater, unless you were lucky enough to catch this one in the one few Digital screenings. This 1991 5.1 soundtrack has enough directional effects and bass to rival the newer snazzier 5.1 soundscapes. Also, there are 2 trailers included, including a swell-looking full-length theatrical trailer.Here's hoping that Paramount embraces the 16X9 format in the future, and they start striking NEW transfers of their old laserdisc releases."
4,"Good Movie, Poor Execution of the Format","The movie is a great transition making Generations unneeded, but Paramount hasn't quite figured out all the benefits of DVD. The lack of extra features is very disappointing."
5,Movie is for my son. He loves Star Trek,It's a great movie. My son loves it! If there were another Star Trek movie he would love to get it as well!
4,This film is more star trek,If you enjoy star trek as much as I do than seeing this film for the first time will be worth it. However if you don't have a fairly high interest in star trek already this film is likely to bore you.
3,Widescreen or cut-off?,"In comparing the DVD to the full-screen VHS version, I have to say that in this case I prefer the VHS version. The bars at the top and bottom of the letterbox were unequal on my copy, with the movie shifted upward, also I noticed in several scenes that the black bars actually cut off part of the full-screen image on my VHS tape. So to get a ""widescreen"" image, I am actually giving up part of the image on the original print, not gaining much in my opinion. Perhaps this is the reason we are seeing more ""full-screen"" versions of the latest releases. Some movies shot in ""scope"" definitely benefit from the widescreen version though."
3,A good film with excellent effects!,I found this video to be very adequate for my needs. It was fun and showed how ruthless Klingons really are (NO OFFENCE WORF!)
4,Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war! (or something),"An excellent depiction of the fact that an interplanetary Cold War could happen in the future. Imaginative and well-paced and filled with good characters. The only thing stopping me giving this film 5 stars is the error in the research. The Undiscovered Country is death, not the future. And Chang's habit of shouting quotes in the showdown in space just come across as silly. Otherwise, a flawless film with a heart-warming ending."
5,Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,"Undiscovered Country took me back to the best of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. The suspense and intrigue was truly befitting a Star Trek movie. And the way in which the torch is passed on, is all befitting an ensemble crew of actors who have provided the world with the story of a future that is very possible. It is also brought a tear to my eye, to say goodbye to some dear old friends that I had known since I was a teenager. But as Spock says in the movie, ""All Good Things Must Come to an End."""
4,What's with the dialogue?,"This is the first DVD that I've played where the dialogue doesn't match the characters' lips! Did anyone else experience this annoyance? It's oh-so-close, and there are long periods where the speech is out of sync and then it's back in again.Wonderful DVD and movie otherwise but I was really disappointed with the lip sync effect."
5,Dazzling,"Sentiment over whats ostensibaly the last of the Startrek films, nicely rounded off with the crews signatures. The film has everything, from excellent special effects to emotion. Not only do we see Klingon blood hanging out in a gravity lacking environment, but we also see ourselves in tears at the end of the movie, when the long and remembered friends leave the big screen after 25 years of the Star Trek Saga."
5,STAR TREK VI ONE OF THE BEST OF THE FLICKS!!!,"I found STAR TREK VI THE UNDISCOVERD COUNTRY to be one the best ever from the special effects, musical score, and storyline. Everything that was sorely lacking in STAR TREK V is back in this film it deals with peace negoitations between the federation and the klingons and CAPTIN KIRK'S feelings of mistrust twoard the klingons. It turns out that there are others who feel the same way but I won't give it away finding out will suprise you that's all I have to say. GENE RODENNBERRY would have been proud of this film as the series gets back to it's roots. I thought NICHOLAS MYER and LEONARD NIMOY did a great job on this film it should've at least some kind of award for it's effects which were mind-blowing anyway this film is a must for all STAR TREK fans see it again and again like I have you won't soon forget it."
4,"Thanks, Nick","If you're in doubt about whether there's any value to Star Trek films for those outside their fanbase, I have two words for you: Nicholas Meyer. No one who directed original cast or Next Generation Star Trek movies (not even Nimoy and certainly not Shatner) ever had a feel for what the whole series was about to equal Nick Meyer's. ST II: The Wrath of Khan is arguably the best Star Trek episode ever (on film or TV, old generation or next), and Meyers' second effort is even better in some ways. Chris Eidelmann's score is also the equal of James Horner's, appropriate to this darker tale. Even if there had been no Star Trek universe for this story to play in, it would stand by itself as a very good film about friendship and the hopefulness for humanity that originally inspired Gene Roddenberry. Absolutely worth your time, even if Star Trek's not your usual cup of tea. ""It's about the future!"""
4,Interesting change.,"This film was different from the usual Star Treks, mainly due to a plot shift away from the usual action to a more sophisticated, mental plot. That is not to say that 'Undiscovered Country' had any less action, but the focus of the movie was more on accepting differences, ""burying the hatchet"", so to speak. This manifests itself in several subplots, including the murder of Klingon officials. I'm not quite sure if I prefer this mental plot to a more concrete one, such as 'Voyage Home', but I do know that Star Trek has always been on the cutting edge of creativity and special effects, and this movie is no exception. 'Undiscovered Country' is definitely worth the money."
4,My second favorite Star Trek Movie,"While i was intrigued by the films theme, it was my love of those Classic characters that drew me to the film. The supposed last film all the original Trek series characters would be in together. Also i was drawn to the dvd extras as well, i always like cast interviews and deleted scenes, this dvd didn't fail to deliver on either. It's not the best Star Trek film, that honor will always go to Wrath of Khan but as a final send off to great characters it was the best."
4,Great movie. A bit boring at times.,"I loved this movie. It's ST duh. Well anyway, this was the final mission of the Enterprise-A and I got to say that I was impressed. Peace between the Klingons and Federation. Who would of thunk?Sulu has his own command. Shakspeare was Klingon? And somebody doesn't want peace. Who would of thunk? Yes that's right. Somebody has gone and murdered the Klingon Ambassador and Kirk is framed. After that the crew has to go and try to find the real killer. You'd be surprized at who it really is... or maybe not, but it is still a fun movie to watch.I give this movie *downs four bottles of Romulan Ale* four stars because the conversing at the table about shakespeare was really dull and the prison part was kind of dull."
4,Decent Ending,"As I mentioned earlier, the ""Golden Years"" of Star Trek were from 1979-1986. The Undiscovered Country is by far the best Trek movie released after 1986. However, the movie does have some faults. Many flaws are exposed when you watch the movie a second. By this I mean that some things simply do not hold up under closer scrutiny. All in all, TUC was a decent way to end the original TOS films."
5,Eye and Brain Candy!,"I have thoroughly enjoyed every issue of Cabinet. As a graphic designer, the magazine's attention to detail and appreciation for clean layouts and beautiful design makes it exciting to read every new issue! The articles are unusual and mentally stimulating as well. Could not ask for a better use for paper..."
2,Looks better than it sounds or feels,I was a little disappointed. If you see a photo of these online or in a catalog they look kind of rugged and adjustable. Up close you'll notice there all plastic and there isn't any adjustment for different head sizes. Who knows? If you like to overdo it with bass and have a big fat head these might be a perfect fit for you.
3,"Informative book, poor bound","This book was recommended to me by another person and both parts of the book lived up to the recommendation. Although the material in the book was good, the binding of the book was of poor quality. It appeared a cursory inspection of any book would have found the page misalignments, which made reading several pages very difficult, however the book was permitted to go to retail sales.I can only beleive the alignment error was noted and ignored and that leaves a bad experience upper most in my mind."
2,Borderline Offensive,"This book had some great point in it and they were things that I brought up in the premarital counseling we are doing with our pastor right now but other than those handful of good ideas/points. I as the man have never been more offended reading a book and my fiancee even agrees. We both read this book and took away that the man should be the one to adjust the man should be the one to change and the man should be the one to do all the work. Marriage is a partnership there will be fights there will be growing pains on both sides,"
3,Good information,"I purchased this book for a friend's wedding gift. Of course, I had to read it before I gave it to her to make sure it wasn't nonsense. It is a book filled with things that a newly married couple with face and gives suggestions on how to cope with all the changes that come with marriage. It also tells us that the first year of marriage sets the bar for the rest of your marriage so it is very important to communicate about all the little things so they do not morph into huge problems. I would recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about getting married and even those who already are married if they are open to discussion."
1,somebody owes Connie an apology,"I fell in love with the sound of Connie Francis some time before I could see over the steering wheel. So, it is with great dismay that I say the best part of this CD is the cover photo. The recording quality gives the impression that Connie was confined to large steel drum. The word ""tinny"" doesn't begin to describe the audio injustice that has been done with this release... which by the way came from her fan club! However, if you want to experience tinny sound to the max, schmaltzy background that at points disables any potential for enjoyment of the vocals, and hear one of the greatest disservices possible to Connie Francis - buy a copy today."
3,"Definitive scholarly conclusions? ... Noooo, not quite yet!","This book lets you know about the biases of many scholars who wish to revise the biblical account or reconcile it with modern methods of doing archaeology and ""biblical studies."" However the scholars are far from being 'decided' about the issue. In fact this author admits that although the evidence suggests a mixed background rather than a single model, the question of Israel's origins is still open and awaits new discoveries about the ancient world. The author attempts to move beyond the 3 competing theories on Israelite beginnings (1) conquest, (2) peaceful infiltration, and (3) social revolution by surveying the textual as well as the archaeological evidence and finds the latter insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions. This is likely to remain the status quo for quite a while... unless some one comes up with a full-proof method to reinvent the past better than the best textual records handed down."
2,Java 2 for Professional Developers,"A lot of the sample code contains typos and the online sample code doesn't exist. Also, the author just points out where to find information in the SunSoft java documentation rather than go into any detail. Stick with O'Riley books"
2,Wrong running time,"Even though the film originally ran about 97 minutes, and even though Amazon's info shows the running time to be 93 minutes, this Laserlight's DVD version of THE FARMER'S WIFE runs 129 minutes. Apparently, the wrong film speed was used in transferring the film to DVD, stretching the film by an additional half hour. The film's tempo is therefore slowed down a great deal, and the pacing and timing of the various comedy scenes are very much ruined. The DVD does have decent picture and sound (mono) quality.This dated and predictable film was nevertheless well-acted by Jameson Thomas as the farmer and Lillian Hall-Davis as his housekeeper. Hall-Davis also starred in another Hitchcock's silent comedy ""The Ring"" (a much better film), also available as a Laserlight DVD."
2,A Hitchcock Film In Name Only That Goes On For Ever,"I have nothing against silent films. In fact Clara Bow's 'It', Lon Chaney's 'The Phantom of The Opera' and Louise Brooks's 'Pandora's Box' are amongst my all-time favourites. But with the exception of 'The Lodger', Hitchcock never really got going in silent films. 'The Farmer's Wife' certainly had the potential for an easy going, enjoyable comedy, but NOT when it lasts over 2 hours. I challenge anyone to watch this film in one sitting without their eyelids feeling increasingly heavy. On the plus points, Laserlight has dispensed with one of those embarrassing Tony Curtis introductions, and has provided us with a newly recorded (and very good) score. The picture quality is also very good. If you're tempted to buy this DVD because it's a Hitchcock film, I'd say don't. It is only worth a look to anyone with an interest in silent films or a genuine Hitchcock enthusiast."
3,"Nicely integrated package, image quality lacking",A solid collection of lesser known titles that are definitely worth the price if you are a true Hitchcock fan. Image quality and extras are lacking when compared with your typical Criterion Collection dvd but for this price you can't complain.
4,A very young promise in progress!,"Believe or not, this is a slapstick comedy, in spite of the fact we are talking about an early Hitchcock. The dramatis personae turns round a humble farmer who seeks desperately a bride after his wife has died. He doesn't seem to realize his housekeeper is in love with him since a long time. A very interesting proposal of a director in progress by then."
1,Junk broke in a few week,"Bought the temperature probe, it worked fine for a few weeks then diedBasically a poorly made piece of junk"
4,A Students View,"As I began to read this novel, it immediately caught my attention. The creative writings of Mr. Peter Hargitai, are unique and quite appealing to the eye and mind. It allows your mind to think and evolve, through each line. There are alot of symboloisms found through out the novel that allow you to better understand the plot. It gives the reader a vivid picture of what was actually going on. The only problem I saw with it was the use of different names for each character. I saw myself going back and forth. I do believe that the subject matter is much deeper than what meets the eye. I think this novel is aimed for the more open-minded and intellectual readers. This novel, deserves to be viewed through the eyes of a gifted individual. It deal with a complex subject matter. Very well written."
4,It was weird but interesting,"From the moment Professor Hargitai began to read a short passage of his book , I knew that this would be a book that I would be totally interested in. I think what caught me attention most in the book was all of his refences to sex and sexual behavior. His word usage is sometimes so graphic (but in good taste) that I feel I might have to cover my eyes if my mother came into the room. At some points the the story it would become a bit confusing because of all the names he would use and all of the flashbacks. I also didn't understand where mythology fit into the story, but I would probally have to read further into that to understand it. Overall I would really recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind and is looking for a great book to read."
3,A students point of view to Attila.,This book from Peter Hargitai is something other than a bedtime story. It is about a family from Hungary that travels to America and begin to show their true inner self as time passes by. This book is so interesting since it talks about fantasy and the truth about dreams needing to reveal themselves as our unknown side. The book is for everyone since it can allow you to open up your mind and give imagination to those who are creative.It will not allow you to go to sleep but to another world since it constantly goes from the present back to the past having you flip through pages and making the book a non ending exciting travel through time.
2,Attila's Journey of Life,"The book Attila discusses a young boy's journey from childhood to adult. The author Peter Hargitai does a good job at portraying the mixed emotions and experiences a boy faces as he is growing up. The beginning of the book displays cliffhangers for the readers as Attila goes through life and death situations. But there is an excessive use of flashbacks in the first half of the story that confuses the reader. The second half of the book should be completely deleted from the book, as it focuses on the future. As a whole, Attila is a good piece of literature. All it needs is some beneficial editing."
3,Peter Hargitai...What a Mind,"Attila, A Barbarian's Bedtime Story, is such an interesting book I asked my college English teacher to review it with me. The book contains taboo social topics such as incest, and death eroticism as seen through the eyes of a child on his way to adulthood. The book also contains action and a bit of mythology. I recommend this book to any reader who enjoys a good complex story with many characters, guaranteed to keep the reader on his toes."
3,Attila review,"Peter Hargitai's Attila is a very different book from others. At first it was hard for me to understand any of the book. I actually had to start reading it all over again after 50 pages or so. Once i started over, i finally started to understand the book, and i must say it is a very fine piece of work. The only thing that was a little confusing were the events that were taking place in the book. Maybe it would have been easier if the author didnt jump to so many scenes and different times. But overrall this was a interesting book."
4,Attila,"As soon as I started to read Attila, I couldn't put it down. Not overlooking the fact that at times it was a bit difficult to follow the various names of the characters, I enjoyed the challenge because it kept my mind focused. I found myself not just skimming over the sentences, but actually reading into every word. Peter Hargitai created wonderful images of Attila' s fantasy and reality which helped keep my interest and imagination going."
3,Not For Everyone,"In Peter Hargitai's novel Attila: A Barbarian's Bedtime Story, he descibes to the reader a journey he encountered. He tells about his travel from Hungary to America. Hargitai uses flashbacks to let the reader know about pepople in his life and things that have happened to him. Although this book is hard to follow at times because it jumps back and forth, it has a good story line and once one finishes the book it will make more since. If you are a person you enjoys reading and can stay with a book then this is a good book for you...if you are the complete opposite and cannot read a book that is quite complicated then this may not be the book for you."
3,An Interesting Experience,"Attila, is a very complex and interesting book which describes many forbidden topics. I believe this book is not apt for everyone to read. It takes an active and dedicated reader to understand and get through all the book before going mad. At times it was very confusing due to the immense amount of flashbacks. Attila is definitely an interesting character who lived great adventures. As a reader is difficult to distinguish the character's fantasy from reality. I would recomend the book to a reader with an ample vocabulary,who enjoys reading and who has a lot of time available."
4,Attila,"I was quite intrigued by this book, since Hargitai lived a most interesting life. Yet, the use of metaphors and flashbacks made the book somewhat confusing. In several instances, it was difficult to distinguish between fantasy and reality."
3,"Attila: A Journey through life, death, and the imagination","This book, by Peter Hargitai, is a fanciful look at the trials and tribulations of an individual who is literally at war with himself. Throughout the whole book, ""Attila"" is unsucessfully trying to find his ""niche"" in the world. His true purpose shows itself when he excapes global armaggedon on a spaceship, and takes his place as a deity, watching over a ficticious world."
3,Attila,"I read this book and was a bit confused at times. There are alot of flashbacks and flash-forwards, which make it hard to follow. Also, the end becomes a mythological tale, which I thought did not have to do with the book. Still, it has potential, and can be revised into a great book."
2,Back To The Drawing Board,"Peter, this book is in need of some help. You had sex, death, action, all the key elements. The only thing was the lack of order in the books context. The class all agreed on the exclusion of part three, good idea. Just look over all the flash fowards and flash backs. Maybe leave less to the readers imagination."
3,"Attila, A Barbarian's Bedtime Story","This book exposed me to things I've never ever experienced in my life. It is an interesting read, if only you read it with an open mind and accept what the author has to say. The one thing i related to in this book were the struggles the author went through moving from one country to another, which is something i've done as a child, where I've escaped from violance in my country. The abuse and neglect the author went through however, was something new to me. It is something i've never experienced, so i did not quite relate to what he was saying. I did however read the book accepting everything he had to say."
4,Attila,I thought Attila to be a very strange yet interesting book. It had a very complicated storyline however the story gets better and better as you continue reading it. I would defintely recommend this book to people who appreciate out of the ordinary styles of literature.
3,At Times Confusing,"This book, though it baffeled me at times, was a good read. The storyline was particularly interesting because it was part autobiographical. This is a novel in which every word must be read--nothing can be skimmed over because something relevant to the next chapter may be overlooked. At some points, the flashbacks and metaphors were a bit much, but overall the book was fair."
5,William Wallace,This dvd goes in pretty good depth of the life of william wallace and his fight for scottlands freedom. Going over the battles he won and lost to his death.
1,not worth $25.,"I bought this dvd for my son, so he could practice the 10 basic forms. I thought the dvd went too quickly and didn't narrate any of the moves. I felt it was a waste of $25. By the title I thought it would have given a detailed demonstration of each move, it clearly did not. The dvd was over in less than a couple of minutes."
1,Good but not the best,"I truly loved the reverse view that this dvd has, it helped me a lot practicing the forms with the instructor but then found out that this reverse view is just available in a few forms from Teaguk 1 until Teaguk 5. I would not recommend you to buy this DVD as it is not worth the money. no explanation of the moves, and it's so short! if you truly wanna learn, I advise you to search YouTube there are heaps of good videos that may even give you a good application of the forms."
5,"A thoroughly ""user friendly"" guide","Drawn from the pages of ""Sailing"" magazine and incorporating reviews of forty used boats (plus a detailed look at ten great used boats to sail around the world), Used Boat Notebook by professional delivery skipper John Kretschmer is a thoroughly ""user friendly"" guide for anyone looking to buy a used sailboat. The Used Boat Notebook provides an authoritative coverage of sailboat prices, ease of use, safety, investment, design quality and much more. Packed with technical information for each boat type, Used Boat Notebook is a first-class, strongly recommended reference written especially for anyone form a novice mariner to an experienced sailor who wants to know just what they are buying before they buy it!"
1,What a disaster!,"Followed the instructions and lost EVERYTHING!Please do not buy this product!If someone gives it to you, don't take it!"
3,Very Comfortable,"While traveling with my sister in Ireland we could not help but crank up the radio whenever this title song would play. Travis has the folk/accoustic touch that seems to have gotten lost in much of todays often irritating excuse for music. So if you like good music and singing, check him out. You just may find what you're looking for"
5,My 2 1/2 year old loves this!,"Reading the existing reviews, I thought I'd add my 2 cents. My son (2 1/2 years old) *loves* this video. His other 'There Goes a...' favorites are: Train, Fire Truck, and Bulldozer. As to the age-appropriateness, I think it really depends on the dispostion of your child. And as to the 'buffoon' issue, yes, Dave's a little goofy at times but he always points out safety issues to counter that and the entire series is extremely informative in general. And I'd much rather watch any of this series, *with* the slap-stick than something like Barney or mindless cartoons. We try to limit tv so our son watches these and Sesame Street and that's about it."
3,One of the least entertaining of the series,"For those of you familiar wit the series- Dave really is a little hard to take without Becky as a foil. Very informative but a little dull at times. My 2 yr. old prefers ""There Goes a Boat"" or ""There Goes a Motorcycle."""
2,Not so much,"I didn't care for this one. The size runs small. It was a bit uncomfortable, so I ended up not using it and giving it away to a much smaller person."
3,good support,"i like this bra EXCEPT for the sides, they can poke after wearing for a while. for a larger breasted woman it offers some good support. I have been on an 8 month bra hunt and this seems to be the best so far."
1,"Loose, and ill fitting",This bra did not measure correctly. The band was very loose. It was not supportive. The hook and eye closures for the nursing cups are difficult to use.
4,Nice set of essays/musings,"I really enjoyed reading Vivian Gornick's Approaching Eye Level, and I don't even live alone. I didn't read too much into Ms. Gornick's essays; I pretty much took them at face value. Her writing style can be described as a bit rambling but also conversational. She probably write just like she thinks.My favorite essay was the first one, which discussed her first jobs as a student. I just found them really entertaining, and I guess the one I could relate to the best. The other essays centered a bit around living alone, relationships (both friendships and marriage), and feminism. Overall, this book is a quick and interesting read. I certainly wanted to pick it up throughout the day to read - it wasn't a chore. I'll certainly read more from Ms. Gornick."
1,Not worth reading!,Still trying to validate the paper it's printed on. The only thing I liked about the book was the design of the pages. Found the essays not especially well written and am looking forward to discussing it with our book review group to see if they can actually shed some light on the issues. Guess I wasn't lonely enough to want to crawl up with this book....it made me fall asleep.
2,Bad Audio,"The production value of this album is poor. The high frequencies are extremely bright- hard to endure on an album that depends on so many scratchy vintage samples. The better the system on which this album is played, the more apparent this becomes.The songs are repetitive. They share the same tempo and structure. Chanting teenage cheerleaders are used on most tracks, turning what would be an original element into an overused gimmick.If you want to experience a truly amazing and classic ""sampling"" album, listen to The Avalanches 1991 release 'Since I left You'. Probably the best ever made, and the benchmark for all that came after."
2,way to much originality!,"I always complain about how CDs are unoroginal but this one is,but a little bit to much for me.I know an entire album devoted and sang by cheerleaders,wow! but i just don't buy it,even if i already had,which i regret bitterly,lol.I just thought the first tracks were catchy but the rest of the CD is simply painful and boring.Anyway if you love it,good for you,but for me,not a chance,such a shame!..."
1,Don't be swayed by Rolling Stones 'Buy these Now' ads!,I was and man this albumn is boring. It's a watered down version of brit-pop mixed with harmonic and samples. It sounds fun when you read about it but it's boring and tedious to listen to. Do youself a favor and pick up some old Bowie instead.
5,Best Album of 2004,"Along with The Arcade Fire's ""Funeral"", this has become a great year for inventive sound. This is an uplifting, feel-good album in a questionable time in our history. It goes against all expectation of what the world of music should be expressing now, and damn it, if I don't feel fine.Bouyant cheerleading chants, scratching hip-hop girl sounds (as if jumping rope), serial TV theme song samples with horns, harmonicas and banjos, trashcan drums and switchblade street creed in a very lo-fi production that adds to the feeling of this being just flung together by young people who just love music of all sorts. Reminds me a little of the Avalanches, but this has more soul. The best 1/2 hour of music that will feel up the entire day if you don't watchout."
5,Hard to catagorize,"""Thunder,Lightning,Strike"" by The Go! Team is one of the most unique sounding albums I have brought in recent years. I am not a fan of hip-hop but The Go! Team's take on 80s-style-break-beats-theme-show-marching-band-cartoon-piano sounds make me want to howl at the moon w/ joy. The standout track for me is ""The Power Is On"" talk about putting the Destiny's Child track ""Lose My Breathe"" to shame this track is so energize I want to dance even in my car when I hear it. ""Bottle Rocket"" is amazing and I love Ninja's old school party-rocking rhymes. Track #12 I heard incorporates a kazoo as the main instrument which is strange and delightful at the same time. I am glad that music like this exist in such a pop manufactured industry too bad it took musicians from Brighton, England to muster up the confidence to blend all realms of music together. Maybe w/ this record other musicians will take notice."
5,"FUN, FUN, FUN","It has been some time since I've described an album as fun. Some of the catchiest music mixed with a bit of low-fi recording. The music is kept dirty which becomes its overall attitude. Some songs sound like they were actually recorded at some crazed hip hop pep rally. This is definitely good pick me up music. A brewhaha of different styles that sometimes stick together for no other good reason than they can. Great album. As a side note if they ever come back over to the states to tour, go see them. I saw them earlier this year at SXSW and it was a great show."
4,"Good, but....","Ok, I love this cd to death. It's cool that the US version has ""We Just Won't Be Defeated"" and ""Hold Yr Terror Close,"" but in all honesty you're better off paying for the import version. As much trouble as their label went through to clear all the samples from the original UK release, they couldn't get them all. And songs like ""The Power is On,"" ""Bottle Rocket,"" and ""Huddle Information"" really suffer without the female MC samples on the verses. Trust me, buy the import instead. It's pure genius."
3,Good Introduction,"First of all, you really can't beat the price. For less than twenty bucks, you can have all four exams reviewed. The key word is review. This book provides good solid introductory information. It is highly recommended you study from other more details books, expecially the Sybex study guides or any book written by Alan R. Carter. This book alone will not help you pass the exam unless you already have extensive hands on experience with the subject matter. All in all, an easy to read, and surprisingly humorous book for introductory students."
1,TURNDOWN,"After watching half of it I did turn it OFF.I have one word for it as what Leonard Maltin says in his classification'sfor the bottom of the barrel movies-He does not give them even one star, It is not worth even one star from me.Wasted my time and money."
3,No Repeats,"This is a movie I bought first, primarily for the kids because of the reviews. No one ever asked to watch it a second time. I say this because one of my kids was watching the Lion King last night, for the umpteenth time. So yes, I agree that eddie murphy impressed me again with his talent... but it just didn't grab my kids, 3 boys and 2 girls. I had to give it a good rating of 3 rather than a 2 to encourage the making of good movies."
4,Pretty Good,"It was pretty funny, especially with Chris Rock doing that goofy little guinea pig guy. I absolutely LOVE Kyla Pratt and Raven-Symone. They were good. Eddie Murphy--good as usual. They kind of made too many ***-jokes for me, though. Otherwise--it was pretty good."
2,I'm not laughing,"I was expecting alot more from this movie. It's a comedy and it's just not funny.Yes, the animal voices are very well-done and are the movies bright spot. All the stars do a great job and they are really the only reason to see the film.Unfortuantly, when it comes to the human cast and the writing, Dr. Dolittle is less interesting than the origional film. To begin with, this has got to be one of Eddie Murphy's weakest performances ever. He's just boring. His family is fairly dull as well ranching from bland to obnoxious. The script isn't that great either. In the Nutty Professor, many excused the toilet humor because of Murphy's great performance or because of the occasional, witty line. This is simply not the case here and the movie is simply boring.I judge a comedy on how much it makes me laugh and Dr. Dolittle failed miserably in this department. It's simply not funny."
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny!",I'm a huge fan of watching a lot of Eddie Murphy films. I've watched them ever since I was old enough to watch television. Dr. Dolittle is the FUNNIEST movie of his I believe I have ever seen! If you like to laugh you'll love this movie!
1,Adult Film in PG Disguise.,"This film is for adults unless you're into molding youth into being foulmouthed, stupid lackluster people who have no couth, sublety or imagination. As an adult film, it can compete with WWF wrestling PPV events in terms of aggressive dialogue. In terms of being a childrens' film, all I can say is that I was truly embarrassed to be sitting there with my 8 year old companion. Luckily, the jokes fairly much went right over his head. Has Murphy pushed the boundaries? A resounding yes! As the society we live in becomes more primitive and unkind, we can thank ""entertainers"" like this one for helping it slip down a few more notches."
1,Where's Richard Pryor when we need him?,"eddie murphy is a comical guy, but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this? Of course, who is the right guy for it? One of the questions i can't stand to think about in this movie, is how Dolittle hears the animals speak, but their lips move and nobody notices. Can't they connect the dots? Obviously not. And obviously, the filmmakers couldn't either."
4,Laugh out loud comedy.,"Dr. John Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) has the so called ""perfect life"", a beautiful wife, two loving daughters and a career that could not be better. All that changes one night when he nearly hits a dog with his car. As he is leaving, the dog calls him a bonehead then runs off. From that day on his childhood ability to communicate with animals is back. Soon, animals are showing up at his home to get help. His colleagues suspect he's going crazy and many decisions still have to be made regarding the sale of the clinic. Just as everything is about to fall apart, a circus tiger falls seriously ill and it's John's turn to prove to everyone that he's not crazy."
3,What happened to Eddie Murphy,This guy used to be fantastic and now he's a C rate actor producing junk like this. My 6 year old was bored!
2,Disappointing,"Not nearly as good as original movie. Too much ""potty humor"" and disjointed story line. I wouldn't watch it again."
2,dr. doolittle,"we received a vhs instead of the dvd. amazon refunded my money. will reorderlater.i cannot rate this movie, because it did not watch it."
5,WOW!!,"FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY!! I loved this movie because of it's humor, and thus give it a 5 out of 5. You'll love it to. HAHA!!"
3,Eddie Murphy at his usual.,"Eddie Murphy just doesn't command an audience like he used to in the original Beverly Hill's Cop. While this movie has it's laugh out loud moments, the plot is predictable and pedantic. Great for a laugh or two, but don't expect anything that pushes the envelope here."
4,Comments on Don't Fence Me In,"The quality of this video is very good from both visual and sound aspects. In addition this is a full length version with a running time of over 70 minutes as opposed to the 54 minute TV version found in some earlier video releases. This is one of the very best Roy Rogers films. An outstanding performance as the retired outlaw Wildcat Kelly by ""Gabby"" Hayes adds considerably to the value of this film. This is a must for Roy Rogers' fans"
4,My granddaughter loves this,"However the only reason I bought it was it was around 5 dollars on clearance, because these are kinda over priced,I also was disappointed it was made in China, which also means CHEAP LABOR and IMHO they are price gouging. And recently there was a notice about formaldahyde levels being 900 times the legal limit in baby clothes which made me promptly get EVERYTHING washable; toys in cluded and wash several times, I didn't know there was a legal limit to expose adults , much less infants and children to formaldehyde.."
1,Boring,"Not the best learning toy out there. It is nice since it attaches to the car seat, but only keeps my little one entertained for a few minutes."
5,LeapFrog Lily,"I had been looking for LeapFrog Lily for some time. My oldest gradson loved his LeapFrog Leap & I knew there was a numbers singing Lily. I was very pleased with this purchase and my grandsons, ages 8 months & 8 weeks absolutely love her."
5,Caramels,These are delicious caramels and great when melted and poured over vanilla ice cream or angel food cake. If you love caramels - you will love these. Enjoy!!!1
4,Classroom Management 101,"""Classroom Management..."" is THE book for those who are looking for the proverbial Teacher's Manual. Apart from covering all the basics in a lot of detail, it offers checklists and (so-called) case studies. The downside of this is that the book starts out a bit dry and too straightforward, with instructions so clear-cut you would think they are for operating some sort of machinery. The ""case-studies"" are examples rather than studies, so the objection here lies with the misnomer. These are clearly minor drawbacks to a great book that only gets better as you read on. With a fabulous Further Reading section after every chapter, and delectable cartoons sprinkled throughout the book, it is an essential text for every teacher's personal library."
4,Good Handy Reference,"I would say that this is a good addition to a DBA's library. It is small and light yet includes a lot of information. You can read it from cover to cover to get an overview or use it as a reference. It gives an overview and then the syntax and steps for doing each of the major DBA activities. I was able to find some information that I have not found anywhere else, viz., the role of log files for the tempdb database. I would recommend this book."
1,One of life's little mysteries ....................,"How she got released on a major label is a mystery. No doubt there's an answer that makes sense, but it is unconnected to singing or composing skills. She looks good in the lyric sheet pictures though."
2,"""The (*Self-Loathing) Seminarian""......","Thinking himself only good enough to fall for and cling to an emotionally broken wreck of a man (""Bradley""), this work's Anti-hero lead actor (Mark Cirillo, playing an increasingly irritating and progressively boring ""Ryan"") will, at film's end: deny...reject...and break the heart of an emotionally stable fellow seminarian (""Gerald""), who actually loves him.Along the way through this ""goes nowhere mess"", our Seminarian calls / texts us to death with a myriad of cell / computer messages---which never amount to much of anything. And don't forget to add in the several ""feeling-sorry-for-myself"" visits home to Mom.2-Stars for fairly good production values and some decent side-character acting.*Evidence of Self-Loathing: ""Bradley"".....and, primarily, Ryan's impulsively changing (dependent on his emotional state) Thesis Conclusions.Final Warning: For your own sanity's sake..avoid this film...um, like something Biblical.....oh, The Plague!"
1,Hold off on purchase,"The first DVD was defective - about half way through the picture and sound became fragmented - I returned it to Amazon and asked for a replacement - it was defective in the same way as the first one, so don't purchase this until the problem has been rectified. The only comment I would make on the part of the movie I was able to watch is, if you get excited about watching people talk on a cell phone this is definitely the movie for you. That's about as exciting as it gets."
2,If you're thinking of buying this movie...,"...I recommend you rent it first. The acting was mediocre at best and the dialogue was something you might hear from 13 year olds. Smart, well made gay genre flicks are few and far between. This isn't one of them."
1,Who knew homosexuals could be this boring?,"The Seminarian has all the depth, subtlety and dramatic flair you'd expect from a Christian Youth Camp play. It's a tedious meditation on the angst of gay christians, without having anything original to say on the subject. It's certainly well-intentioned, but also mind-numbingly, at times even hilariously earnest. The dialogue is gratingly banal and predictable, though several of the actors frequently don't seem to understand their own lines. The pace is glacial. And, most annoyingly, the characters rarely speak face-to-face when a phone call will suffice. So watching the movie is a bit like working for a few hours at a call centre. If you're a gay christian in need of affirmation, then skip this and watch Prayers For Bobby. Better yet, read The God Delusion and really expand your mind."
2,"Poor Production quality, plot, and theology","The film concept was interesting and held the potential to be very thought-provoking and innovative. However, the writers appear to have a poor grasp of theology or the nature of academic research, making the writing inauthentic and unbelievable. This also killed any of the theological import it could have had.Further, the production values were poor at best. The camera was kept almost exclusive at a middle/close-up, with very few to non-existent cut-aways or alternate shots. Long takes cans be effective when they have a reason, but here they were merely dull. Further, the sets were bare and inauthentic and uninteresting. The shots were almost uniformly too long (each one could have lost a few seconds at least), making the pacing unbearably slow.Overall, there is almost nothing to recommend this film."
2,Shallow and Disappointing,"I have to totally agree with the comments by ""Galileo"" below, especially, ""...the dialogue was something you might hear from 13 year olds."" With a title like 'The Seminarian,' I expected to see a drama revolving around the conflicts of a seminary student between his personal convictions and the morality system of a very traditional church. This movie, to the contrary, is about a young 20-something who is frantically searching for a loving relationship, the guys he falls in love with fail him, and he ends up in a state of painful disappointment and confusion. There are 2 or 3 shallow references to God along the lines of, ""What does this say about God?"", with no further development or insight. The seminary is just a backdrop to the story: the setting could easily have been a high school. Think ""Glee"" without the good music. I gave it two stars because I think the main actor, Mark Cirillo, shows promise for a good acting career in a more professional production."
2,the seminarian,Not what I thought it would be. Not an interesting movie at all. Slow to start and slow to end. Not a good movie at all. Waste of money for sure.
3,ok kinda,got this on sell. working ok. time to time computer ignore to recognize this sd card. slow read write rate.
1,Defective,I purchased this card for my Canon SD790 IS camera. A memory card error immediately appeared on the screen.I think i will stick to Sans Disk SDHC cards.
1,4GB card will not work in my Dell Dimension E310 computer,"The format of this SD card must be unique. My computer will not recognize it. My daughter's newer HP desktop will read it. So I have to download on hers and put on a stick, then move to mine. Yuck. Dane-Elec website seems out of order today."
3,Good for the price,"It cost in less than 5 bucks when I bought it a year ago. After some 4-5 months usage the time to charge my cell phone fully increased like taking about 7-8 hours at a stretch, but it never stopped working. So for the cheap price I paid, its well worth."
2,Disappointed But Loyal,"When Chris released this new CD, I rushed out to purchase it. I was disappointed when I listened to the entire CD. I am a loyal fan, and I was expecting to hear the timeless and classic Chris Walker from ""First Time"", and ""Sincerely Yours"". I await his next CD and concert tour schedule."
5,Manufacturer made good,Quick delivery. Product was faulty. Returned to manufacturer. Manufacturer replaced faulty product.
3,OK Value - Image is not that bright,"This unit is lightweight, compact and comes with its own carrying case. Keystone adjustment is very easy. But I was disappointed by the brightness of this unit. Although it is rated to be a 1800 ANSI lumen projector, it is not as bright as other 1800 ANSI lumen units I've used or even some 1500 ANSI lumen projectors."
5,Not just for conferences...,"This book was presented to me as an aid to sucessful parent teacher conferences, and I must say it live up to its recomendation. But even as valuable is the way its ideas and sugestions opened up new lines of communication between me and my children. Communicating with a child about their education is difficult and pointless if you have no goal or standard by which to compare your progress. This publication give you that point of reference and explains how to establish better open communication."
5,Liddell & Scott Abridged-Compact,"I own larger Lexicons and the Unabridged Liddell's is one that I will ultimately add to my library, but for carrying back and forth to Greek Class, you can't beat the L&S; Compact. Its small size, large vocabulary and clear print make it a 'hands-on' reference without rival. It's close enough in size to the UBS 4th Ed. to make the perfect match. It is highly respected in both the religious setting and at the University. I was very pelased with the prompt service and the great value.Abridged Greek-English Lexicon"
5,This dictionary is a life saver!,I bought this Ancient Greek Lexicon in order to help me translate a play by Menander for my senior thesis. Very seldomly am I unable to find the words I'm looking for. Many of the obscure forms of the verbs are listed and refer the reader back to the main entry. I highly recommend this item.
4,The only book I ever sold that I wish I had back,"I took ancient greek in college for one semester. I loved it, but for some asinine reason, when selling my books at the end of the semester, I decided to take the $5 offered to me by the bookstore for this lexicon instead of keeping it. Bad move. I've wanted it back so many times since then, just to flip through or just to have it. I used it a lot in class and for my homework. It had a pleasant shape/weight/heft. I think I even wrote margin notes in it. I definitely should have kept the book. It's strange how we remember things like this nearly 20 years later."
4,The Intermediate is better for legibility and reference,"The ""big"" Liddell & Scott is the one to buy when you're about to do your doctorate. Until then you would be better off with the Intermediate, and not just because it's only about a third the price and much easier to carry about. The Intermediate has a much clearer typeface and many students find its material more easily accessible.The ninth edition of the ""big"" Liddell & Scott has been offset so many times that the print is faint and verging on the illegible. My copy actually has pieces of print missing. The Clarendon Press ought really to have the whole thing revised and reset. But what a daunting task! (It will probably end up being republished on disk.)"
1,a warning,"By all means avoid the 2009 U. of Michigan edition of this indispensable book. It is a Google digital facsimile. Most pages are merely ugly, but perhaps fifty are so smudged, as if someone had dragged an inked rag across them, as to be completely illegible. I had to return my copy. Make sure to get the book produced by Oxford University Press."
5,An Excellent Resource.,This is well written and useful for both the seasoned PERL Programmer as well as the beginner. It covers all materials and is laid out in an effective manner making looking up information extremely easy. One of the best programming resources I've come across to date.
4,Great reference book,"This is a great reference if you need to find out how a function is used in a context because of its numerous complete example programs and subroutines which you can also use as a base for your own programs. However, if you want to learn Perl from the ground up, I would recommend the slightly humorous and very well written ""Programmering Perl"" by Larry Wall (the inventor of the Perl programming language) et all. The latter is great as a study book and the instruction list it features answers every question you could possibly ask about Perl.""Programming Perl"" is the book I always reach for, but I do not regret buying this one. They both have their pros and cons."
1,this is not a beginners book,"first of all., my reason for giving this book a rating of 1 star isthat I bought it on the assumption that it was a beginners book. It may very well be a good book for intermediate/advanced, but since it has been marketed for beginners I give this a rating of 1 star.I have never been so compelled to rate any book, ever, until seeing the positive ratings.My final remark is, though, Eric C. Herrmann may know his PERL, his verbal/teaching skills are seriously limited....Phil"
2,Mystified by the reviews,"Note: date of this review should read ""15 December 2012"".It has been suggested (I forget who said it) that Chute should have titled the book, ""The London of Shakespeare"". That sums it up. I've read practically every book-length bio (nearly 50) of William Shaksper of Stratford and Chute's is one of the emptiest biographically speaking, though that means (to here credit) she added less than the usual amount of speculation. Frankly, I find it among the most boring of the genre. As a description of London and the theater at the time it may not be bad, but it is certainly not the best book on that subject either."
4,Very interesting!,"We English-speakers are so pelted with the name Shakespeare from earliest recollections, and so over-exposed to scenes and lines from his plays, that many of us (including me, who took a course titled Shakespeare in college) become after a time benumbed and uninterested in anything bearing the too, too familiar appellation. Neverthess, I was curious to see what a non-literary bio of the man might reveal, and was pleased to find much in this book of fresh interest about him and his times. You might be surprised, as I was, for example, to learn how common it was in Elizabethan England for the ordinary man to be involved in lawsuits, or that London sported a two-storey shopping mall. But the choisest plum -- by my peculiar lights -- is a subjunctive-mood classic angrily uttered by the Bard's aged partner at the New Globe Theatre, on the occasion of his being disburdened of the day's ticket receipts by thugs in the employ of creditors: ""If my son come, he will thump you hence!"""
3,VHS quality,Please note that this DVD was recorded from the VHS and looks terrible.As for the story it's self; I am only a few hours in. The pacing is slow but I expected that for a long series.
3,"We do need more Buffy, but don't buy UK tapes in US",First off if you are in the US I know the temptation to buy the UK tapes as suggested in another review is strong. BUT UK TAPES DO NOT WORK IN US VCRS!I have this set and the Buffy/Angel Chronicles and would love for them to release more. However the tapes that are out hit most of the important plot points of the season (especially useful when you are trying to corrupt friends) as well as having the clever dialogue we've come to expect from Buffy.
5,Start out with this,"This is the first season of Buffy.1. Welcome to the Helmouth - A great opener. Introduces the main charecters. Has a cliff hanger ending. A+ Continuded...2. The Harvest: The cliffhanger ending comes to an end! You find out, with an episode as good as the first. B3. The Witch: Another great episode. Has another cool ending. Buffy is officially a great show now. A-4. Never Kill a Boy on the First Date: Another good episode. But unfortunately not as good as the first three. B+5. Angel: The first Angel-themed episode. He has a major roll on this very good episode. AOverall: A-"
3,Look - there's more!,"Having recently become a fan of Buffy & Pals let me say this is certainly an eye opener for the 'scared of my own shadow type' that is me. Having caught a glimpse of a show on TV - it made me want to go out and see and find out more about Slayers/Watchers - and Vampires with souls. I recommend this box set as a must. Being lucky enough to have the UK version, which puts all of season one in a box set in correct order - I say that is an absolute must. Can't wait for all of season 2 to come out on vid - and am avidly watching season 3 as I write. Hope the series never disappoints....."
4,see below,Nice set the intros by Joss are very intersting. My only complaint is the episodes are not in order and make completeing the set awkward other than that Buffy at her best. Only buy in UK if you have an NTSC video...there is now PAL (UK) version of this
1,"Why is this classified as ""horror""","Every one of these reviewers say how ""intelligent"" this show is. Intelligent to who??? Maybe a bunch of pre-schoolers. Sarah Michelle Gellar is nothing but another crackly-voiced mall rat who couldn't act if her life depended on it. Why is Buffy classified as ""horror?"" Sorry, mislead ones Buffy isn't scary in the least. If you think that Buffy is scary then obviously you have not experienced a real horror movie like Scream."
4,A nice compilation that has some good episodes,"Well this collection of Buffy episodes has some of the best episodes of the first season and can be considered as a good introduction for things to come later in the second and third seasons. The highlights here are Welcome to hellmouth , the first episode of the series which is directed with style and has some nice action. Also The witch is a good episode that is fast paced , funny and eneregitic. And ofcourse Angel and the puppet show are another two very good episodes as one reveals the truth about Angel in an atmospheric episode while the puppet show is an entertaining episode about an evil being among the contenders in the talent show. But this collection however misses the best episode in the first season which is ""Prophecy "" which was the shocking , Joss Whedon directed season finale."
3,not the best choice,this choice was not the best for my purposes - it did not last very long either - new batteries did not help - I did purchase another one and put it in a different mount - it works great - can't beat the throwaway price
3,"It's ok,easy to get loose.","easy to get loose because of the impact of the gun,it's cheaper than other brand that mount on the grip."
5,Quality Product,Universal Laser mount is a quality product and is user friendly for mounting on a pistol without picadilly railing. I recommend this product as usable and fairly easy to install. It may take a few tries to get on target but worth the effort.
3,Simple lil gadget,"I bought this but I had to send it back. Even though it states 'Universal', It did not fit my SW40E (Smith &Wesson) 40 cal. So I returned it and was fully refunded. It worked right out of the package but unfortunately it did not fit my pistol."
3,50/50 shot,"I ordered two laser sight units. One works perfectly, the other work when it wants to. It mostly does'nt want to. A little hard to install properly. Also no instructions included."
4,Just what I needed,"Not as strong and durable as I had hoped, but its really inexpensive and works just like I had needed it to. Thumbs up."
4,pistol red laser sight,THIS PRODUCT WAS AS ADVERTISED AND FULFILLED MY EXPECTATIONS. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IF NEEDED. AGAIN THIS PRODUCT IS RECOMMENDED BY THIS REVIEWER.
5,What would I do?,"I love this movie! A woman who's putting her life together thinks she sees her daughter in the mall where she works, but the little girl supposedly died a year ago. Is she crazy? Is her little girl alive? This movie has twists and turns and you'll want to watch it again!"
2,One song on this CD is terrific,"I bought this CD after hearing the song, ""She's Gone"" (which is not a cover of the Hall & Oates song,""She's Gone"") on CBC radio a couple of times. It is very good pop. The rest of the recording is rather repetitive and unimaginative. I would suggest at least trying out samples of the mp3s before buying, and even just downloading that song."
4,More on TCL/TK than web programming,"If I had picked up this book for web programming I would have been very disappointed as only the last chapter covers this. Instead I was looking for a book on TCL/Tk 8.0 or later and this acts as a very good introduction. All of the sample code is built-up line by line and worked through repeatedly; This might get wearying, but it is much clearer than other books on TCL I have read. You do not need a laptop to work though the examples when reading the book on a bus either."
2,very poor packaging...,"The price was good for the specs but did not have the chance to try out because it was damaged during shipping. Handle was bent (caused the crack in the plastic covering), oil all over the place, both gauges were bent inward and broken (gauge housing is plastic... not metal like others). Box was fine except one hole in the side."
1,Disappointing,"Seane Corn is obviously a gifted Yogi but I was very disappointed with this DVD. The instructional tape is thorough but very. very slow. She seems to take ""Forever"" to explain a posture before you are prompted to get in the position. The ""Just breathing"" DVD is just that and no other voice instruction. It is pretty to watch but impossible to follow unless you keep looking at the screen. Unless you stare at the screen you are bound to miss some of her transitions from one move to the next. A quick ""naming the pose"" would have been very helpful. I have been practicing Yoga for about eight years now. I am a very physical person who likes an aerobic flow to Yoga. I though that was the approach with this DVD since it is titled Vinyasa Flow. Again very disappointed."
1,DON'T USE!!,Should not be used with Thunderbolt! Probably any capacitative touch screen. Destroys calibration for touch. Had to do factory reset! A call to HTC confirmed that. Wish phone had come.win a warning.
1,"Adjustment WAS needed, but not possible","I can't honestly comment on the sound quality of these headphones, because I was so discouraged by the fit, that I haven't even tried listening to anything yet. The 'comfortable, no adjustment needed' headband was such a sloppy fit that the ear cups hung nearly an inch lower than they should have at my ear. With shipping charges and restocking fee to the seller, I can't see that it will be worth my while to return them, but I was sure disappointed. Maybe they'll fit over a hat, but don't assume they'll give you a comfortable fit just because you have an adult head."
4,New Edition available,There is a new edition for this title which is A History of the World's Religion by David S. Noss.
2,Not for everyone,"The product works as advertised, but, at least for me, it is even worse for wrist and hand issues than a conventional mouse. With a mouse, it is possible to rest your hand lightly on the mouse. With this touch pad, it is necessary to keep your hand suspended, since touching the pad (obviously) acts as a click. By adjusting the mouse settings in Windows, the degree of needed wrist action to use a mouse can be reduced to little more than with this touch pad. In addition, like touch pads that I have used on laptops, it can be a little inconsistent--it seems like sometimes you have to whack it to get a response while other times just getting near it causes something to happen. As noted in other reviews, the buttons feel cheap."
2,Only Supports 3 Buttons,"We purchased this device hoping that we could program left/right mouse buttons on the bottum and Page Up/Page Down on the other two buttons to the left and right of the touchpad. Our goal was to be able to navigate PowerPoint via the additional two buttons. The device is advertised as a 4-button touchpad. However, after installing and talking to Adesso support, I discovered that the drivers only allow you to program 3 buttons. If you only need 3 buttons, this is a great device. However, because it is advertised as a 4 button device, I am giving it only two stars."
2,Touchpad mouse,"I have had to use the touchpad type mouse for years due to a pinched nerve, causing my hand to go numb.The old one, from years ago was far, far better than this one! I guess they were bought out and the qualityis not so great. I cannot make the software work with Vista. They made a simple thing more compliacted.I wish that my old one had not worn out and it would work with Vista. Please, someone come up with a REALLYgood touchpad mouse for a P.C."
4,Very good touch pad,"The comfort is good, but it would be nice to have an adjustible stand at the bottom similar to the Browser Cat.Construction seems to be solid and unit is very easy to use. It has several programming features.I particularly like the larger pad area."
1,Not worth the money.,"For the price tag this device has VERY poor construction quality. The plastic body so poor that the device came to me slightly warped. So now when I run my finger over the pad it constantly wobbles. My review would be at least 2 stars better if this device cost between 10-15 dollars. But at $54 this was a really bad purchase. As for the performance, it works just fine. The touch pad sensitivity is a little sloppy and given the small surface area this is causing me problems. It's a shame that Apple get on board with a device like this."
4,Jaxxerific,Get Me Off is inarguably Basement Jaxx's sexiest song and this album delivers with some fresh remixes.
2,Forgetable early Hitchcock movie.,"This is a review of the Laserlight DVD release of 'The Skin Game'. This is one of several early Hitchcock films that I'm sure would have been lost without trace had Hitchcock's name not appeared on the credits. In fact, Hitckcock probably wished it had disappeared without trace; there really is very little to commend this dull, boring movie. As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are of an acceptable standard and Laserlight has also included a trailer for 'Dial M For Murder'. But there's no getting away from the fact that this is a cheapie DVD for Hitchcock completists only."
1,A tedious attempt,"Generally I find the early Hitchcock films unique in different ways but this one could have ANY directors name on it and it would still be a bad film. It doesn't have that 'Hitch' feel to it and if the first reviewer was correct in saying he was forced to do it -- I believe it.I couldn't even understand the actors so I went looking for subtitles hoping there would be an English set but no such luck, I just had to wait for half an hour for my ears to adjust to the dialects, then I could understand why I was I was bored.The auction scene is the only one that bears any resemblence to a Hitchcock movie. Small wonder I paid more for the shipping and handling than I did for the film."
2,A very old movie,"This Laserlight version is decent quality, given that the movie is almost 70 years old. The movie itself, however, put me to sleep. Very little humor or suspense, and I expected one or the other from Hitchcock."
4,One Amazing Animal,"Ever since I was a young kid I wanted to own a big cat. I have lived with a house cat ever since I was born, 21 yrs. It doesn't need to be said how happy I was to find a book detailing big cat ownership. How interesting is this book? Well, I read all 200+ pages in 2 days. While not the most professionally written, it is packed with tales of Cougar that at times seem almost to amazing to be true. When finished, I didn't want it to be. I want to hear more about Cougar's adventures. Although David is against big cat ownership, I think this book also shows possibilities with the right committment. I hope to someday meet Cougar and David to share in the joy that this great cat brings wherever he takes David. My best to Dave and Cougar"
2,"nice story, but not an expert","Read review by ""Williams"", which explains it quite well. Raber may be a good exotic pet owner, but he is definitely not an expert on the animal he owns."
3,A nice story but a bit boring,"David lived the dream of cat lovers - living with a big cat. I wish I did.The story of their relationship is really enviable and it all started off OK, but he soon started talking AT the readers, and it all just got a bit boring. Owning one big cat doesn't make anybody a felinologist. And he didn't know a great deal about cats anyway. Or, it appears, any other animal. There were a few major slip-ups in this book.Anway, still - half his luck. But the book isn't as good as ""Zamba - The Story of the Greatest Lion That Ever Lived"". Now THERE'S a truly inspirational relationship......"
3,For lovers of wild cats,"David Raber tells a unique story -- one which many animal lovers might wish to relive. His accounts of life with this amazing cougar are worth the read. But an animal expert he is not. He may know volumes about raising a cougar in his home, but he called an opossum a rodent. Other misstatements were less obvious but inexcusable. Still, the story was fun."
5,Absolutely delicious taffy,"I cannot get enough of this taffy. I've already placed two orders, and will probably place another one as that's how good it is. The colors are wonderful, and the selection in each tin is really varied. I pass it out to co-workers who find it irresistible, so now I'm on tap to continue bringing some in. Anyone looking for some great taffy will not be disappointed in this!!!"
4,James River Guide,I recently purchased this book and found it very informative I have been around the james river all my life and recently have been canoeing the river and purchased this book to suppliment my canoeing experience and found it to be informative. As a referance about what I might find in my trips. It doesn't cover all of what I have seen but is a good referance as to what to expect along the way
5,Entertaining and Educating,"I am a member of ""Booklovers"" Trinity Book Club where we had the pleasure of having Mr. Ernest Hill present to discuss the book. I enjoyed the book immensely. I felt that I knew each character personally. I have seen many Miss Audreys. It was great to see Maurice grow from boyhood to manhood. It really made one see the difference between 'love' and 'being in love.' It also makes one realize that there are choices to be made and that they should not be made hastily. I would love to read a sequel to this book. What happens to Maurice and Danielle? If a relationship develops, how does this affect all families? What will the friends and neighbors say? Does Omenita become the jealous, outraged ex-girlfriend who tries to win Maurice back? I have read all of Mr. Hill's books, and by far, this was the best. Keep up the good work."
1,Could not get into this one!,"I'm a huge fan of Ernest Hill, however I did not like this book which was purchased on my kindle. It dragged on and on and on...most of the characters were unlikeable. Love can definitely be blind."
4,Wondering Minds!!!!!!,"I truly appreciate the experience I shared in reading this book. I felt engaged to it form the first down to the last chapter. Mr. Hill has a way with words. I feel there were some underline sexist approaches through out the book, but still never the less a great book. I saw that Love can and will be blinding to those who don't want to open their eyes to reality. I am glad Maurice mad the decision he mad, but upset with Omenita. I believed in her potential in growing from her past, and desired her to think differently of her surroundings. A key point that was made early on in the novel that we all should take heed to, was never let who you came from nor what people think of you control your destiny. As an individual you decide what you will endure so choose what is meant for you instead of another's burdens. I am a proud fan of Mr. Hill's novels and anticipating upcoming readings."
3,Geat Book...but Lacking,"This is a great book to introdce newbies to the world of Unix. However, due to the fact that it is a little old the Internet part is basically useless. Another thing is that all the complicated tasks are left unexplained. And they don't tell you how to configure X."
1,Cheaply Constructed,"I bought two of these chairs, and the third time me and my boyfriend used them at the beach they wouldn't fold back up. One of the bars on the legs of both chairs just snap in half when we tried to fold them up."
4,Handy To Have Around,"This chair is so comfortable. It is so light, which is wonderful. I carried it to a parade, since it was so light I did not get weighted down walking long distances with it and it was easy to set up. Sitting in it was more comfortable than I expected it to be. I would definitely by another one."
3,comfortable but poorly built,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for a friend. After it was promptly delivered, I decided to unpack it and try it out. I found the chair to be very comfortable and sat in it in my living room for about 15 minutes. Happy with the purchase, I decided to pack it back up and put it under the tree. That's when I noticed it already had a tear at the seam in the seat. If I hadn't been so lazy, I would've sent it back for a refund. But I put it off until Christmas and ended up giving it to my friend with a disclaimer that I could send it back if he wanted. He accepted the gift and claimed he could fix it.If not for the tear I would've purchased one for myself."
2,A piece of [JUNK],"While this is, by far, the most comfortable chair I have owned, it BROKE the 3rd time I used it. You get what you pay for."
2,"Caution if you are over 5' 8"" or have long legs!","This chair is indeed convenient and a great idea. However, I am 5'10"" tall and this presented some problems. Mainly, the head rest is not high enough and the seat is not long enough. In order to get my head on the headrest, I need to slouch in the seat. Slouching in the seat exacerbates the fact that the seat isn't long enough. After 10-15 minutes of sitting in a seat that isn't long enough you start to feel some serious discomfort in your back thighs. If you're up and down a lot it may be OK but if you're planning on plopping down for a while I don't recommend this chair at all."
3,Comfort with a twist,"I ordered two chairs, one was perfect, the other defective; it wouldn't open fully. The chair was comfortable with the headrest removed...with the headrest, I experienced some neck strain. Also, the container bag split before the first use... disappointing!"
1,fell apart in two days,Last year we purchased two chairs with footrest one chair fell apart in two days the other in three days. Although the chairs were very comfortable they were not worth the price.
4,Great Chair - small defect,"Beware, the loops that are designed to hold up the footrest will rip if you are not careful. This is not a problem because you can just strap them around the legs of the chair. Everything else is great - I use it instead of the love seat in our livingroom."
3,Time will tell if more stars are deserved!,"I intended to give this chair more stars, until I read the other reviews. Since I just received the chair a few days ago, I cannot attest to the longevity of it. However, I will be taking it to the infield at the WC stock car races in November, and that will be the REAL test of whether or not it can take it!As far as comfort and aesthetics go, it gets high stars! I find it very comfy and cute, and it expands and folds together easily - fitting nicely into its carrying bag....let's hope it holds together! :-)"
4,man this is taerg!,"this chair is so great i have to spell great backwards in the title just to show you how great this great chair is! wow. great armrests, great headrest, great miles per gallon, great everything!buy this great chair now!"
3,"Loved it , but it broke!",After seeing someone with this product at a softball game I new I had to haveit. So I treated myself and got one. Only the second time in use both plastic clips that hold the straps to the footrest up broke. I had to tie the footrest up to use it and now am trying to return it.
3,So-so comfy chair,This chair is comfortable for the first 10-20 minutes but then the bar behind your back will start bothering you. I put a pillow between the bar and the material and that seemed to help a little. We did take it to the beach and now I can't get it folded back up. Haven't figured out yet if its sand in the mechanism or what so you might want to be aware of that also.
2,foot rest snapped off,"For the price, you can't really complain, but the foot rest did snap off after only a week."
1,A beach disaster,"We received two chairs...the arm on the first one broke when the first person sat in it. A 160 pound man, not a giant person. The second one won't fold up. So they are useless."
3,Needs better shipping,"I ordered two of these for Christmas for my husband, and we eagerly anticipated using them for camping. However, one of them arrived broken. When I returned it for a replacement, the second arrived broken, as well. These chairs are shipped in a box with no padding but the thin nylon carrying bag they come in, so it's not surprising they don't survive the shipping process. I sent both of them back and asked for my money back, and the refund has been very slow in coming."
4,Folding Chair Reviewed,These chairs are so comfortable that we move them from the deck to the inside of the house to watch T.V.......and so easily moved that they go back out again in the morning!
1,never buy this product,it is not worth it at all. the chair broke and came apart just after one month after i bought it.never never make the mistake of buying it.
5,A Great Deal!,"This chair is great! I bought it for tailgating at baseball games. When I set it up in the living room, it was easy to set up and I found it to be extremely comfortable. I am buying another just to keep in the trunk of the car."
1,Had this less than a year,"Sometime ago, this chair broke on my after owning it a year. I used to set this chair up in my livingroom, watch t.v. After a while, it just wend bust, plastic pieces broke. Just not worth sending back and complainging about."
4,Lot of chair for a little money,This is the 2nd chair I have bought. I felt so guilty using my chair while my husband had to sit in a straight fold out chair. So I bought him one too. It folds down amazingly small for such a big chair. I have both of them in the back of my van along with a single upright folding chair and they take up very little room. They come in handy for a lot of different occasions. I used it first at a fireworks show. I used it while on vacation at a campground. And I next plan on using it at a upcoming airshow. It has a handy drink holder and a headrest that you can use or flip back. I am very please with this product and with the fast shipment from ... This is a good quality product that will last me for years to come.
4,remarkable value,"This style of chair has become very popular lately. This one is priced better than most and is quite sturdy although I'll have to see how it stands up after being outside for a while. Like all the chairs of it's kind it is awkward to get in and out of and it forces you to sit slouched which is hard on the back eventually. It is, however, no worse on either of these counts than any of the similar, more expensive ones I've tried. And like all the others it is light and compact enough to take to the beach or a picnic for the day although it is too heavy to take on even moderately strenuous hike."
2,broken foot rest,I love the chair! My only complaint is that that the poles that support the foot rest tore through the foot rest only 4 days after I got it....I had some stronger material sewn in for aboput the price of the chair! But for the price it is still a nice chair.
1,Good but...,I bought this chair and it broke after 2 days. The leg looked like it was from shoddy craftmanship.
2,"Nice idea, but needs some work","I bought multiple chairs and about 75% of them got stuck in the open position. Same thing for all of them, they just wouldn't close. Comfortable chair but needs some design work I think."
2,Loved it but it broke too!,"This chair the most comfortable and convenient thing i have ever owned! I brought it everywhere with me. Yesterday,I was packing up, and the chair would not fold down! For the life of me, i can't figure out what is wrong but it just won't collapse. to say the least, I am disappointed. I've only had the chair for two weeks."
2,Get what you pay for,"I bought this chair for my dad for his birthday, it worked wonderful for about a week, then one of the joints that connects the foot rests to the chair broke (he was just sitting in it when it gave way, and he fits well under the weight limit). Also, on the foot rest, on the side where it broke, the seam is coming undone and looks as if it won't last long. We still use it from time to time, we're able to prop the leg of the foot rest against the chair and it holds, but if you don't want to have to deal with something like that, you should look into a different chair. But, I suppose that if it's not defective, this chair is great for the price.... just fair warning...."
3,"Good product, but the kit was a surprise","When I bought this product there weren't any reviews for it - there were for a lesser model but I didn't know that then. I understood it was a kit, but i was thinking it meant putting about 10 pieces together since the picture showed the finished product, not the actual kit. What a shock when I opened the box and found an empty motherboard and about 50-100 pieces to solder onto it. Fortunately, I found someone locally to put it together for an extremely reasonable price. So I just want to warn people, if you're not up to soldering an entire motherboard, pay the extra money for them to assemble it before they send it to you. Now that it's assembled, it works great."
5,Must Have,"One of the Must Haves for any actor. Also required reading if you really want to make it: ""Audition"" by Michael Shurtleff, ""How to Be a Working Actor"" by Mari Lyn Henry, and ""My Fractured Life"" by Rikki Lee Travolta."
4,Definitely read this if you are dumb and want to be an actor,"...just because ""it's for dummies."" I'm not trying to insult anyone's intelligence.Anyway, this book is a good resource for someone who is considering a career in acting, or a move to Hollywood, and has no clue. The character in my book, Trott Felipe, could have used a book like this before he made the trek from Iowa to Hollywood in his Astro Van. Unfortunately, he's a fictional character, and this book didn't exist in the version of Hollywood I wrote about."
3,Gift for husband,I only bought it for my husband because of one song. I have others of Roger Miller that I like better.
1,Some sort of TV movie gone awry,"Poor acting in a tale about a Jewish journalist who decides to infiltrate a band of Nazy skinheads in Germany. Some nasty violence, but it's never really scary enough, and the lead role can't decide if it's going to be wisecracking or serious. I didn't care for this."
4,Awesome watch,"For some reason, This item came up in the women's watches when I did a search. I bought it assuming that, and was very disappointed when it was definately a man's watch (rather large dial face), however I was very impressed with the quality and look of the watch. So impressed in fact that instead of sending it back, which I had planned to do, I decided to donate it to my local sportsman's club as a raffle prize. It was the first item selected!"
2,Great light,"This bulbs produce a nice and great light, improve your visibility really. But too short life. My old Hella bulbs die 18 months old, this only take 5 months and are very expensive.(note: cargym's is a bad dealer)"
1,Duane Hopwood,"I see very little that was enjoyable about this movie until the very end. This drunk washed up good for nothing does despicable things the whole movie and the viewer is supposed to ""feel bad"" for him. Sorry not happening. The whole time you want the wife to escape and give his kids a real chance at life without a violent drunk good for nothing dad."
5,A lovely surprise.,"I admit that I didn't expect much going into this. Whiney ""Ross""... as a lead role in a serious movie? I mean c'mon!!*eating those words*By the end of the film, I had to completely reassess my feelings toward David Schwimmer. Give the fellow a good role and he will shine! Two scenes exemplify: the discussion with his ex's new beau over his daughter's weight (i.e. when he grabs the baseball bat) and his trip to AA. Wow. I'd have never guessed him capable of such intensity. Janeane Garofalo really surprised me as well. Who knew!?!?!!I often hear negative comments regarding the film's slow pace. As if ""slow"" is a thing to be avoided in movies. The pace really gives time to let the gravity of events sink in. A fast pace, while great for an action movie, would cheapen a film like this beyond repair.Summed up: Fantastic story and performances, incredible atmosphere and a wonderful soundtrack!Both of my grubby little thumbs go way, way up for this one!"
5,First good film all year!,"I heard Roger Ebert talk about this, so I tried to see it in the theatre. Unfortunately, it was limited release. I couldn't find a theatre showing it.Now that I have finally seen it on video, I have to say it's the best film I've seen all year. It's the first film I actually cared to watch to the end. The writing, directing, casting and acting are excellent.David Schwimmer should have been nominated for an Oscar. Very Truthful portrayal of an alcoholic. Much better than ""Leaving Las Vegas."". Hell, This film is better than most of the junk the big studios dish out every year."
4,A character you should know...,"This is an honest, heartfelt film about real characters in real situations. Schwimmer turns in his best work yet as an alcoholic casino pit boss whose life is falling apart. This film gave me a nice, warm feeling, despite the fact that it is not uplifting and has no message to offer. Perhaps that warm feeling came from the realization that there are still original voices in film?"
5,Amazing in every way!,"Duane Hopwood is one of my favourite films of all time. Being a big fan of David Schwimmer I was really looking forward to the release of the DVD and after watching it for the first time I was absolutely blown away. David Schwimmer has always amazed me with his incredible acting skills, but this film really shows how much of an amazing actor he is. It's about a decent respectable man trying to earn a living, while struggling to fight for custody of his two young daughters. It's the best film on alcholism I have ever seen and it's about real people dealing with real life. My father struggled with alcholism and I know how hard it is to watch your family fall apart. The kids in this film really moved me, I couldn't believe that they could act like that at such a young age. I definitely recommend this film."
2,Not for normal people,"I thought my 2 and 4 year old sons could learn a few things about table manners by watching this video. It turns out that this video is only about eating in extremely formal situations. It tells which of your 5 forks to use first and how sorbet is used to cleanse your pallet between courses. Good if you are eating with the president, not good for the average family who would like to improve kids' manners."
1,Waste of money,My poor kids had to sit through this video. I sat there watching it and it was soooo boring. This lady just sat there and talked and talked. It didn't catch my kids attention. No fun anecdote or symbols to help them out. I was very displeased. My husband was even asking what was I thinking when I bought this video. If I only knew I would have never purchased it.Don't waste your money or your time. It just bores you about formal dining and so outdated.
1,Just like a PROPAGANDA newsreel,"All the information is one-sided. I mean, it just shows the events on British side. On the German side, the information is very brief, just a couples of seconds each time. The scenes that show the real fighting are very short and also one-sided. The majority of the scenes show something that are not directly related to the battles at all. For example, people in the factories producing war stuff. Another scene shows people cut down trees to build defensive lines.You won't learn anything from this DVD. It's much better to read a book on this subject such as ""An Army At Dawn"" by Rick Atkinson.I'm glad I borrowed it from the local library instead of purchasing it."
3,Good for a time,"This scanner did a good job for awhile then you couldn't get the squelch to work, the only thing that would work was the weather frequencies."
4,Fast Focus,"I find the fast focus on this item to be very useful. Product is not like the old days but at the price I paid it was a bargain. It's just what I wanted, and I'm quite pleased."
3,Binos are OK,"Binos are OK for the money paid - you get what you pay for. However, there is a big downside to these cheaper binos as they are neither fogproof or waterproof. I also own Leupold Green Stripe binos and there is a huge difference in the optics(although they are a lot more pricier). I opted to take the Bushnells to a UM football game last week, and they are still unusable a week later due to the rain we encountered during the game."
4,A nice solid cheaper pair,This is an affordable and functional pair of binoculars. They aren't the best but will work for most everyday usesThey are very reliable. I have no complaints
3,OK for the $$$,"They're ok for the money. I should have bought a more expensive pair, guess Mom was right ....""you get what you pay for.."" Moms are like that."
1,Terrible,These binoculars were a big disappointment. You can't see far or clear at all. I am sorry I made the purchase.
2,Not that great,"not that great, cant view the objects clearly.Very less options for Zoom. Feels like waste of money.Can get better one for same/little more price."
4,Kenya Safari,"This one worked for our safari in Kenya, Africa for the most part. We were able to see most animals with good clarity. The cheetah was pretty far out and there was a moment I wished I had something a little stronger."
3,Great Value,"Great value for the money. I use it mostly for ball games, but it comes in handy when hiking and sailing."
5,Excellent delivery time!!!,"I just ordered these on 2/24 and have just recieved them today, 2/25. Excellent delivery schedule. I tried them out, and love them......very good buy, and excellent seller. Patty ~"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"WOW, what a piece of junk these binoculars are!!! I've had to return 2 different sets. The first set were about a week old and my husband went to pick them up and put them in his backpack to go on a trip, and the eye cup came right off in his hand. Amazon was great about replacing it. Now I'm returning the replacement, because, within a week, the entire eye cup/focusing mechanism (so both eye pieces and the stem, etc.) came out of the housing. Both pairs had been treated properly, and never dropped. This is just shoddy workmanship. Bushnell used to be really good, but obviously quality control is no longer a factor or consideration. Perhaps because they are MADE IN CHINA?????? At the same time, you get what you pay for I suppose. I'll try an expensive set and we'll see if they are in fact any better; I suspect the lack of quality control is a larger issue than the price paid."
4,this book was very good,if you ever read this book it is very deep. this book is about a Jessica that hates her stepmother alot. when Jessica finds out something she goes crazy. so she starts to write books no one in school likes her. she eats lunch alone her room is all black. this is all i will tell you for now!
4,Its a page turner!,"This book was really good, I couldn't put it down and ended up staying up all night just to finish, even though its not long, its awesome, but at the beginning i was slightly lost, like theres a series and i missed something, but then everything became clear, so if you like vampire novels, then pick it up for a fun read."
3,Demon in My View,"I love this book, the one person I like was, Aubury!!!!!!!!! I think you should get this book, even if my parents hate the paranormal, I love vampires,and other stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think that Aubury is very cute and cool. He is the dreamest guy ever in the world, even if he is a vampire and not real!!! ):"
3,Done before you know it,"The concept in this book was interesting. I need to go back and read In The Forests of the Night as I think Jessica makes her initial cameo in that book and I hope you learn more about Aubrey. The story kept me going right to the end but everything seems to happen so abruptly. In the space of 176 pages you meet Jessica, learn she dreams are reality of the vampire community, meets Aubrey, falls in love and then chooses to become a vampire. The book really glosses over her reasons for being so eager to become a vampire that it is a little shocking. Considering the author wrote this at such a young age though it was a good book to read if you enjoyed The Vampire Diaries by LJ Smith and Twilight by Stephenie Meyer."
2,Better than In the Forests...,"I will admit that I thought this book was better than than In the Forests of the Night, yet it still did not stand well on its own. As a book written by someone in her teens, it is better than passing. As a piece of fiction on its own, it is a little contrived and unoriginal. Though I like the character Jessica, I liked her more the first times I saw her, as Alisa in The Last Vampire series and Anita from the Anita Blake mysteries. If you have read any of the books from either of those series, you will see the... shall we say similarities? If it were not for the novelty of the author's age, and her obvious, but still to be developed, talent, I would say don't read this. But this book IS interesting, in its own way. If contradictory. And a bit unoriginal. But still, interesting. Try it."
2,Slightly Disapointed..,"Though, this book is slightly longer than the first one, I was still disapointed. First of all, the authors writing style seems to not have improved at all, and her voice sounds like that of Anne Rice and a blend of several other writers, thus denying the quality of uniqueness that makes you want to jump in and gobble up every word. Not only that, but the story is rather unoriginal as well. If you have ever read ""The Last Vampire"" by Christopher Pike, then you will see that the relationship between Jessica and Aubrey is very similar to that of Sita and Seymour (Seymour also writes true stories about vampires). Still, it's worth a read to make your own opinion. I would have given this book a two and a half if I could have."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't let the summary fool you. It sounds interesting, but it's horrible. The plot is pointless, the characterizations are unrealistic, and the main character is definitely not likeable. The entire time I was reading the book, I kept waiting for the good part to start, and then I read the last page and realized it never came. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Just doesn't have that spark . . .,"There are too many plot holes, it's just too unoriginal. Just like reading one of Christopher Pike or Anne Rice's books. The ending was quite very weak. The book was just too weakly written."
3,Sequel Doesn't Stack Up,"In her second novel, young Atwater-Rhodes writes about her make-believe fantasy world. The main character's description sounds a lot like the author's. I think Atwater-Rhodes put her crush with an unreal vampire on paper. When I read this book, it left me thinking, ""I could do this."""
3,Every outcast teen girl's dream?,"An averagly done sequel. When you read it the first time you may not notice it, but when you read it again the relationships of her character grap you by the collar and scream ""This is what it's like, Ok?!...so be shocked!"" An outcast girl hates every one around her because there ""cooler"" then her and she is not exepted because...well I don't know why, I mean she secretly writes horror novels, has a great figure and ""gorgeous"" dark hair AND a sexy vampire named Aubery is madly in love with her. What teen girl wouldn't want to have HIM for a boyfriend? Atwater-Rhodes is secretly trying to get you to think, ""Jeez, how CAN Jessica not be cool?, she's so mature and likable."" She takes battered Jessica's social bashing to the extreme, drawn out and exaggerated."
5,By far the book written in the last decade for all ages,"I have heard many reviews for this book, some of the are very true but some of them shock and confuse me,that is just my opinion. But I believe that 'Demon in My View' is the most inspiring book for teen because it tell you to follow your heart and most of all, that reading and writing is power and those who read and write have the power! This statement proves that it is true when Jessica's stories that she writes have a power over her very existence because some very angry vampires come to have revenge on Ash Night (Jessica's auther name). And during this time of heroism,fear,adventure and amazingly love, a familiar characters are mentioned. Aubrey is one of the vampiers that play a very importaint role in Jessica's adventure. So saying this I very much suggest that you find out for yourself how you feel about this breathtaking story."
5,A ride for a teenage vipire fanatic,"I love books based on the supernatrual, and this book definatly hits my top 10 fave books. Im 15, and read Amelia's first book, In the Forest of the Night, about 5 months ago, but was only able to buy this great sequal recently. And let me tell ya, I love it. I prefer it better then the 1st book, which had a great story, but this one... In the middle of reading it I thought ""Oh no! Im almost done with it! It can't be."" I wouldn't suggest this book to guys though, becuase it's mainly about a romance, between a hot hunk of a vampire, and mortal girl. So girls, GO FOR IT! You wont be dissapointed. I just finished this book ten minutes ago! And I am soo glad shes coming out with a new book. I was almost worried she wasn't. Agian, GREAT BOOK. She is definatly the Anne Rice of a new Generation."
4,Impressive writing but something was lacking...,"I think that the writing was impressive, especailly on a 16-year-old. The story was pretty good but something was missing. I liked seeing Aubery return and lots of charecter devolpement in his direction. But I found a few things strange about it. It almost felt like the author was putting herself in the lead charecter spot. And with the whole Aubery story-lline was like reading ""Daughters of Darkness."" He reminds me way to much of Ash, an evil charecter in the first book but he has a change of heart in the second when he meets his soulmate. I'm looking forward to her next book, I hope her writing will mature along with her age."
1,I've read better,"I agree with the ""reader from the USA"". Yes, this chick is very talented and all that, but this book proved very much otherwise. It was a cute story at first but then it just started to become plain boring and cliche. What kind of vampire would go into high-school just to kill some girl? Why not be smart and attack her while she's asleep or typing on her computer? And he doesn't kill her because she can stare into his eyes? It's just a vampire/human love story gone wrong."
1,More of a teen's dream than a five star story,"Of course this is a popular book for drab, confused teens and those adults who still haven't recovered. The story is more of a wishful tale of the author's fantasies that are shared by many who think like this. Far from her best and most likely in saying her first isn't her worst but all the rest are."
4,*Demon in my View*,"This is another great book by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, even if it's not my favorite book by her. I loved this book because of the suspense and mystery surrounding Jessica and her family. Even though it's hard to get if you haven't read In the Forests of the Night; it's a for everyone book! Lots of characters that come in other books appear here, so it's easy to connect with her other novels."
3,Getting Better,"It's so-so, except for the fact she sounded too cliched in the novel. The mood reminded me of a terrible Dawson's Creek episode. And the characters acted like three year olds when they should be acting their actual age, being hundreds of years old. The writer obviously didn't think this one through."
2,Self-Insertion Fics are BAD,"(...) I have to say that I didn't really like this book. Repeat after me: self-insertion fiction is bad. Mary Sue characters are the bane of writing. This book reads like the kind of junky fanfiction (as opposed to actually good fanfiction, which easily surpasses this novella) found on the Internet. You know, when the author inserts herself not-too-subtly into the storyline. Not to mention, the characters are flat, cliche, and one-dimensional. Jessica is the stereotypical outcast, etc. etc. Blah blah blah.Here's hoping that her books actually improve..."
4,"Great for a teen, but still Cheesy","When an author writes a book, one way or the other they give you a door to their psyche, their inner person at that point in time. Though, normally an author is at least in their twenties. Amelia gives us a slight entrance on how she saw the world... when she was fifteen, and well, I'm not that fond of teenagers.I discussed a bit my opinion on this talented, though, still (at least in this book) immature writer when I reviewed her first book, so, I will skip that part.One of the big improvements on Amelia's story telling from her first book to this (her second): Her characters have depth. Now, her characters are beginning to look real, with complexities, with likes and dislikes, with defects and virtues.The bad part, it is TERRIBLY cheesy, and quite predictable. You have the vampire that is terribly attracted to a human, and not any human, but one who he has to kill.Still, she is talented, and I am hoping to finish the rest of her books."
2,"writing improved, interest dropped","i admit her writing has improved, but i wasn't interested in Jessica's problems at all. she seemed very cynical and always whined. plus, aar had stereotyped the typical loner, as cold hearted and feeling hatred against the world. aubrey sounded like a jock, while fala seemed to be the only character i was interested in. i give her one star for writing it and another for being published so young -- in the end that's the only reason she's being praised. her writing level is below average, i have seen better. this is pitiful and it's sad to see so many young writers look up to her."
3,"Erm...it was okay, I guess...","Did any of you ever go to a role-playing chat room where everyone states their characters but no one mingles? I have, and it is usually very tiring. Amelia's characters are there in the book, but they do not seem to connect. Going along the lines of an RPG, she describes their clothing much, like when Jessica meets Aubrey, which I think is kinda shallow. Although her vocabulary and descriptions are amazing, the plot does not seem to weave itself into a good old ghost/vampire story full of suspenseful twists and turns..."
2,Over Hyped,"This book is many times more shallow then I would have expected from such a praised writer. For all the magazines (Teen, Y.M etc...) I expected to read a story with some depth.Not one with simple, personalitiless characters that easily fall into cliches. But this is not the only problem the entire concept is done in an amaturish manner.It's obvious within minutes of starting the story it was written by someone without any real-world-experience.The only thing that this book accomplished was to prove that Hype can't make a story."
3,"""IN THE..."" WAS BETTER","Ms. Atwater-Rhodes really disappointed me in this book. I was expecting her to be a bit more original and not simply steal from Christopher Pike's ""The Last Vampire"" relationship.In The Forests Of The Night was much better because I really enjoyed Risika's character and how she beat Aubrey at the end. Speaking of Aubrey---as many of you have said---how did he get so strong in ""Demon..""?This book was in now way original and she simply took the old vampire mythes and used them."
4,good book,"I really liked ""Demon in My View,"" and I have also read Amelia's first book, ""In the Forests of the Night."" Some ppl liked the first book better, but I liked the second one; it shows that she has improved dramatically on her writing, and I can't wait until her third one comes out, though I don't really read about vampires all that much! lol."
5,BREATH-TAKING!,I loved it! It kept my attention the whooooooole time. Please Amelia Atwater-Rhodes write another book! Everyone will totally fall for it. Amelia again inspires me to write more at a young age! PLEASE READ IT!
4,People are missing the point!,"Some of the other reviews are commenting on Aubrey's change from evil to good. They are saying that this is a bad change to the story. But that is Ms. Rhodes whole point. There is no total evil, there is always room for the good in someone. Even someone like Aubrey.I thoroughly enjoyed her first book, In the Forests of the Night, but i saw a more mature style coming through in Demon in My View. The author had a much more twisted plot with many threads that she wound together in the end, and some, she hopefully will bring back in other books.I cannot wait for her next book and her next book tour! Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a very talented woman and i hope that she doesn't give this up!"
5,Very excellent book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is action packed with a twist of romance and at times comedy and horror. Jessica is all alonein the world except for her stepmother, who shes not to fond of. Everyone at school avoids her and shezs always alone writing books. She doesn't want people in her high school to know shes an author so she put the a pen name down as ash night. A mysterious boy moves into town and they hit it off. Through twists and turns they both ge more than what they hoped or feared."
4,***,"""Demon in My view"" was a very good book. I loved the characters, espeically Aubrey!! This was the first book I've read by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, but I'm on the prowl for more. Anyone could enjoy the book and it's not a hard read."
2,"Honestly, it just didn't do it for me.","I had been wanting to read this book for a long time. Word reached my ears that it was amazing.Well, I was sourly disapointed.In the book a ""flawless"" girl named Jessica has a talent for writing vampire storys and thinks thats all that they are- storys.Then the relization kicks in on how her storys are actually real and vampires want to kill her, one falls in love with her, typico!I found myself hating this Jessica. Too perfect was she, the author should have created some flaws to make her less dry and boring.The book was so pridictable that at one point I put it down and didn't come back to it for a week, already knowing what was going to happen.To me, it was dry and tastless. yet, for a fifteen year old I think if she stives towards making her charatures more interesting, she could come out with a good one.It honestly didn't do it for me, and if your still debating on wether or not to read it I say go for it. Just, be prepared for disapointment."
2,"2 and a half stars really. It was an okay story, but...","I thought Ms. Rhodes had better character development with this story, and I admire her writing style, but I was disappointed with the story. I'm sorry to those who enjoyed it, but I didn't care much for the main character and didn't care whether she lived or died. I thought it unrealistic for Aubrey to fall for Jessica and be such a wimp in the story and sacrifice so much to save her when he's supposed to be this feared and mean character. I hope her third story is better than this one and has more believable actions by the characters. But keep writing, Amelia! I'm sure with time her writing will get better."
3,Shows promise,"Overall the plot was great, but the writing was lacking. like wearing a sweater that is two sizes to big. She should have tightened up more. I recommend MIDNIGHT PREDATOR instead."
3,Good But Lacking,"The book is well written and has a good story to it, but lacked that little leap of detail and passion in the characters. The fact that it is a book based on teenage vampires doesn't help much, however this is also a book for 'teenagers'. I suggest this book for teenagers who do like a good vampire read under the juvenille section."
4,"Good, but not as good as the first","I liked Demon in my View a lot, but Amelia seemed to soften Aubrey up a bit. I liked to think of him as the powerful, never loving, traditional vampire, but when he gets his crush on Jessica, it gets kind of unreal. The ending, although good, was a bit predictable. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to all."
2,I was pretty disappointed,"I admit I liked ""In the Forests of the Night"" better than this book. While ""Demon In My View"" is somewhat ""decent"", I was disappointed with the story. I didn't care for the main character who I thought was too self-absorbed and cynical. I couldn't understand why Aubrey would want to help her.The Aubrey character was the biggest letdown with this book. For Aubrey to be such a tough vampire, I thought it unrealistic of him to fall in love with Jessica and give so much to save her life when he despises humans. The only thing I can say I like about this book is Atwater-Rhodes' poem and writing style. I hope her books get better over time."
1,Horrible teenybopper fluff,"""Demon In My View"" (the title is lifted from Poe's poem ""Alone"")contains nothing of redeeming value, or any serious literary merit. I think any 6-yr old could produce better art while half-asleep. The story is trite, confused, slow, and stereotypical. The editor should be immediately fired for letting this into the market. The annoying social consciousness, laughable teenage ""angst,"" and downright idiocy will appeal to the ""Dawsons Creek"" crowd I am sure, but this is not for me, or any other discerning and intelligent reader."
5,Handy Helper,"I have arthritis and it is very difficult for me to pull the lever on my recliner so I can lean back. This lever extension is great - it is comfortable and easy to hold onto, making it so simple to lean back or to close my chair. A great item!"
1,"For me, a piece of junk",I would hope the average customer purchasing this item would have better luck than I. The powder coating on thescrews was so thick I had to power wire brush them to bare metal to get them thru the holes. The welded bolts the screws attach to were a 1/4 inch too long preventing me from being able to tighten the assembly on the chair lever.I had to grind them off a bit and re thread to be able to use it. Possible a unique problem but a pain for me.
5,Extended my arm reach by 6 inches,I love this handle extension...it attached easily and is really easy to grasp. It eliminates the backwards stretching I had to do to reach my chairs handle. My order was processed and shipped in record time too.
5,excellent,This lever was purchased for my elderly mother who is recovering from rotator cuff surgery. She can now raise and lower her recliner without a lot of effort.
4,getting out of a recliner made easier,"Follow instructions for installation. Would like to see it a little longer. Being short, I could not push the leg rests fown. With the extender. I can now use the lever to help set the lounger in an upright position."
4,lever extender,"i had surgery on a broken right arm at the wrist with arm in a cast and recliner lever is on right side.Both my shoulders have torn rotator cuffs..i bought this hoping it would help the lefthanded reach to the right side lever.it does help but be aware when chair is reclined all the way back, the chair lever arm with this extender on it makes it longer and therefore makes the lever even further back behind chair..and very hard to reach w left hand..i had to push with legs to get chair sort in the upright position to where i could grab the bar w my left hand and finish the job...i still recommend it tho-its much better than using just the chair lever..also it is a very sturdy and heavy item."
3,MIXED,"My husband liked it on his lounge chair. Hence, I bought another one, this time through the Amazon network, for a friend and her lounge chair. She didn't like it at all. Mixed review - one for, one against."
5,Lifesaver! Best little helper Ever!,"I am a small person, so reaching the handle on my recliner required leaning over even before any injury. Then I had a car accident and I have a lot of trouble with leaning and bending and I have pain in my shoulder and back. Not only does the LEVER EXTENDER make it easier to reach the handle, but the added leverage makes it easier to push and pull it even with my injured shoulder. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone with back or shoulder problems!"
1,My screws/bolts lost the ability to HOLD!,Worked VERY WELL untill I had to re-install to another to a different chair! Somehow my screws/bolts got stripped! Do not when it happend? Please tell how I can re-order. THIS IS BEST PRODUCT! Please respond to my email adress. Thank you!
2,"Big Need for this Solution, Poor Design in the Execution","I am an Ergonomics Consultant with VERY short arms. This product looked like just what I needed to be able to reach the handle on my recliner without over-extending my right shoulded. I injured it about a year ago, and it has been difficult for me to reach the handle more than ever.Unfortunately the design of the product made it only slightly easier for me to reach the handle and the hard metal handle stuck out into the walk way and I must have hit my leg on it 5 times before I decided to return it. I applaud Standers for their attempt at addressing this issue, but they missed the mark in my opinion when it came to design."
2,lever extender,"I have severe arthritis in my right shoulder. This device ""sort of works."" I don't have as much pain as I had before I put it on."
2,Handle extender,"I didn't like this product much. Bought it for my dad after his stroke to make it easier to use his recliner. The thing doesn't seem to stay tight enough and wobbles, so he won't use it. It may fit some other recliners better, I'm not sure."
5,Very nice and very HELPFUL,I have arthritis and can not use my legs to put down my recliner and this handle is great; it gives that ease of use and makes the recliner handle just that much larger and higher ; making easy to reach. My recliner handle has fabric on it and was not sure if it would work. Fastened easy and doesnt slid or move on the recliner handle. Very secure.
1,Not for over-sized La-Z-Boy recliners.,"I bought this because I thought it would help me use my recliner after I have major abdominal surgery. Well, it's not made for over-sized La-Z-Boy recliners. It fits, and it works, but it is still very hard to reach the handle to both recline and sit up. After surgery I will have to have someone to raise and lower my chair for me until I can do it myself.It is a good invention, but it just is not made for all styles of chairs."
2,They can slide on the carpet,"The chair risers are advertised as ""nonskid"" but they can slide on carpet. Bought these for my elderly father who had hip surgery. His chair is in the middle of the room and when he sat down or stood up the chair slid. He uses a walker so it is dangerous for the furniture to move. Also, I did not think the depression at the top of the cone is as deep as it was described. Probably if the chair backed up to a wall or you don't need a walker they would be OK. Even though I had used them the Stander Company said to return them. I bought them through Amazon and the return process was very easy through Amazon."
3,Read the Product Dimensions Carefully - These are not all the same!,"BE SURE to read the dimensions for these risers carefully! I assumed that there were 8 of the same height. My mom's sofa has seven feet (weird, I know, but that's what it is), so when I discovered that there were 4 of one height (3"")and 4 of another (4""), I realized I would have to order a second set to get what I needed to raise that one piece of furniture! These are plastic cones that were overpriced to begin with, but that would have brought the total up to almost $100 for plastic feet to raise my mom's sofa just 3 or 4 inches! The choice was clear: back they went."
5,Nice tool to ease recliner operations.,"When properly installed and used, next best thing to a full-powered recliner at way less cost. Will buy another when needed."
4,Good item,"I bought this for my mother-in-law, who now has back problems due to age. It is a significant help for her to get out of her recliner. I myself could use one on some days. My mother-in-law and I are about the same height, average female at 5'4-6"", and in a regular size recliner, we have to stretch quite a way down the side of the recliner to reach the handle, which is not a problem if you are normal, but as anyone who has back problems knows, sometimes you just cannot lean to the side, or you can lean, but cannot put any strength into pulling the lever without pain, or risking the chance of re-injury. This is a nice solution.However, you need someone with a good back and knees to get it ON the recliner for you.It is not exactly cheap, and only time will tell us if it is worth the cost by lasting a long time."
3,Works not as tall,The extender was easy to place on the recliner. However it was not as long as I expected. Otherwise it worked fine.
2,Poor design,The shape is not really compatible with the side of the chair. It would be better to design it to fit flat next to the chair; flat on top; and protruding on the side away from the chair. That way it would be easier to apply the necessary pressure to move the original chair lever.
1,Do not buy the Kindle edition!,"I have recently purchased this book, based on positive reviews I've read here and in other places. After reading the introduction, I am even more certain that this is a book worth having. But, the Kindle edition of this book does not containt a table of contents, making it very difficult to find the specific chapter you want to read. I just finished reading Kind Lear, and I tried locating the chapter about the play using the search function. I received 57 pages of results, and it was a laborious task finding the one which brought me to the opening of the chapter about the play."
3,"my kingdom for an editor! or, brevity is the soul of wit.","Marge Garber has thought long and hard about Shakespeare's work, but her book has a fatal flaw: it is too long, and (like Bloom's execrable, self-indulgent fantasy),it lacks linear drive and cogency. Each essay meanders through its play without a clear thesis or argument, skipping (often brilliantly) from topic to topic like a butterfly. Bloom begins his chapters with a hypothesis, then (self-admittedly) circles and circles it, finally announcing ""see!I was right!"" at the chapter's end - never haveing documented a fragment of evidence along the way; it's a con game. Garber's chapters are like a walk through a garden; the flowers are beautiful, but you never know where you're going, and it's easy to get lost in the maze.Compare these works to Frye's On Shakespeare, or Mack's Everybody's Shakespeare, or Empson's Essays, and you can see what a good writer pack into a small space."
5,Amazing help!,"Shakespeare After All is an amazing book when you need to understand the backgrounds of Shakespeare's plays. I am taking a Shakespeare class; however, his writing confuses me a lot so I usually need to look up meanings and try to figure out the play that way, but after reading her interpretations of the plays that I had to read, it was much easier to understand where he was coming from and what certain lines meant. Amazing book if you need to analyze Shakespeare!"
2,Works well in a single room,"I like the phone's simplicity and ergonomics. It's fatal flaw is the lack of range. My office is about 50ft away from the base, and I get unacceptable interference. Both plain old AT&T & GE 900 handle this distance without any problems."
3,"Excellent battery life. But after a few years, lots static","Got this phone a few years due to price mostly. Has turned out to be pretty good, especially considering that I dictate on it for a couple of hours most nights. No battery problems. Headset jack doesn't provide good volume though. Also, lots of static starting to be a problem from the phone on the phone line. To fax today successfully I had to unplug this phone, even though it is 30 feet from the fax machine."
5,COM/COM+ programmer's essencial,"This is a great set of books that joins all the COM/COM+ stuff you must know in 4 sets of books.I usually had several different books hanging around regarding all the different COM stuff. For example when regarding to COM I would use the Essential COM or DCOM Unleashed for reference, on the other hand if wanted something about ActiveX/Automation I would use ""Understanding ActiveX and OLE"" and for COM+ I would grab any COM+ book available. The books are great and although they are available in the MSDN universal subscription, I simply hate reading e-books usually if I'm really interested in them I print them out and consequently almost deplete my printer's toner.In a final note and must reference that I said 4 books because the COM+ Reference book, is somewhat dispensable for me, since I usually use MSDN."
2,The one and only COM/COM+ Reference......,"It is normal for me to use allot of different books for reference, but in terms of the global based COM technologies that number it maximum. For example, I would usually use for reference regarding COM the book by Don Box, Essencial COM. On the other way if I was working with ActiveX I normally had hanging around Understanding ActiveX and OLE, Visual C++ ActiveX COM. And finally if I was working on COM+ usually my I would grab anything I could get my hands on and for DCOM, my favourite pet was the DCOM Unleashed!!With this set of books all the COM stuff is there and its format between the books is identical (of course), simplifying the search within them after you get the hang of it!!!"
3,"Great book, but very math intensive",This is a great book but it approaches the subject very mathematically! So be ready to see lots of derivations and proofs of many concepts presented in the various chapters.
2,Left hangng,"Troll Quest is a well written book until you get to the last chapter where the author appears to have just gotten tired of writing. The book builds slowly, a well written storyline headed for a climactic finale and then the reader is left hanging with no conculsions and no sequel. Very frustrating and disappointing."
3,He said..........She said.........,"I listened to this on a tape while I was walking. The word ""SAID"" must have been said about 500 times throughout the story.........very irritating!!!"
5,87TH DELIGHT,have read eveyone of the 87th novels-yes i paid 20 bucks for some of the early 79 cent out-of-print paperbacks-and this is one of the best and certainly one of the most humorous....the first 87th novels had the detectives as WW II vets....now the same guys are still 40...ain't fiction wonderful!!!!!
3,Disappointed,"I have read all of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct books and have loved them. However, I found this one moved slow. I've almost finished and can't quite get through the last couple of chapters."
3,Funny At Times,"This was the first Ed McBain novel I read. Although this story was funny at times, I thought that it was just okay. The main character Oliver Wendell Weeks is not very likeable. I have since read other Ed McBain novels and they were much better . This novel is not a good introduction to Ed McBain but it is entertaining at times."
4,Size runs a little big,Beautiful ring. Petite looking on your finger because the 1.50 carats is hidden somewhat by the bevel setting. Good clarity and sparkle. Size runs a little big.
5,skin beauty from your pantry,"a resourceful and inspiring living beauty book, that pampers your every skin need with love, compassion, and the ageless traditions of Mother Earth."
1,"""Cruelty-free""","By my definition, this book is not cruelty-free. Not even close. The recipes call for ingredients such as eggs, buttermilk, honey, lanolin, and vodka. A good majority of these recipes are not vegan, and I would not recommend that vegans order it."
3,can't see sample,"The three star review is only based on the index and references. This author chose to let customers see inside the book. While I understand the importance of indexes and references, an actual sample of writing would have been appreciated. How can we tell if it is age appropriate? The author indicates a reading level of K-12, that is a lot of ground to cover!!!"
1,Wood warped the first time it was hand washed in the sink,"The wood was not properly sealed, and became ""splintery"" the first time that I hand washed it in the sink and towel dried it."
4,A Trade Off,"I have a pair of Sony MDR-V700s, which my brother broke, and I needed a new pair. So, after trying the Koss QZ-99 Noise Reduction Headphones, I bought these JVCs. As for sound, they are really great. Not near audiophile status, but the bass REALLY thumps! How can it not with 50mm driver. They sound almost BETTER than my Sony's (when my Sony's worked =]). However, words cannot describe how flimsy these headphones are. I'm a high school student, and I might as well break them now and save the disappointment I'm going to get when they break in my book bag because its inevitable. That's why they lose a star."
4,"Dave Mason ""Unplugged"" and very good","This Cd was a very pleasant surprise to me, as I took a gamble and bought it after reading the reviews on these pages. Mason's guitar playing is really showcased and it's clearily evident that he is a master craftsman with the guitar. This album is as good as any of his and better than some. I like it as well as Eric Clapton's unplugged and the song selections are well done. I really can't find anything wrong with it, and I do recommend it especially if it's on sale or from one of the Amazon stores, it's just one of those nice finds that when you play it, you like it. I just wish Dave Mason would write new material because he has/had a talent that should still be producing new songs."
5,"It takes me back to ""La Belle Province....""","I bought this a few years ago in a cutout bin for around $5. I had never heard of the group before, but when I went to Québec this summer I made sure to take it with me. Many of the tracks show Irish influences as Québec was a destination for hundreds of Irish immigrants during the 19th-20th centuries. Some of the songs showcase the unique Québécois choral style, others such as ""Beluga"" are original compositions or interpretations. A wonderful taste of Québec music from a very talented band (I love the brass section--it really gives it an extra kick!)."
1,annoying,"I admit, I don't own this toy. I let my 2 yo son play with it in the store to keep him occupied. which it did, he sang along with the ABC song the first few times, then he was pressing it just to hear it. it only sings the ABC song, then giggles. After 20 minutes in the store I was more than happy to put it back on the shelf."
4,Good Reference,"The fact the Mr. Wallace dedicated two big chapters to ActiveX, which includes builds in both ATL and MFC makes this book a definite addition in my reference library. If you read this book from cover to cover you kind of get lost in the process but as a programmer how reads cover to cover you just read the section you need."
3,I too have problems with Coriolus books,"I now regard books by Coriolus and IDG publishing with skepticism (sp?) as a result of having been seriously disappointed in a couple of their titles I bought. I did find this book interesting because of the info in the appendix for generating raw COM code. I recommend Wrox as one of the most technically accurate book publishers. BTW, My All-time favorite author is Coplien."
5,Great Stuff,"The reviewer was quite rough. Not every song on this CD is great, but it has some of the most rockinest music I have ever heard for the most part, especially the first two tracks."
5,Like the perfect dry martini...,"Film buffs of a certain age will find this two-disc version a real feast: a Bunuel documentary with home movies of the director demonstrating how to make the perfect martini -- which finds an echo in the film itself -- is a wonderful treat, and the original movie is beautifully restored. Of course, then there are the cockroaches scurrying from the piano during the torture scene....and the priest administering the most extreme of last rites. Bunuel's sharp critique of bourgeois morals, religion, and political corruption is at once comic and horrible, the film's characters blissfully unaware (except in their own dreams) of their own desperation. These are old themes, perhaps, but the emptiness of these lives is striking. It will all seem pointless and a bit silly to some who see this movie for the first time, but the endless absurdity of the final image -- you mean that's it? -- makes the director's message clear: for these characters, there just isn't any more."
1,Dumb,i did not like this movie what so ever. it was the worst thing i've seen. i did not understand the storyline and if i wanted to read for a hou and a half i would of read a book. some movie with subtitles are okay but this one hit the fan. i did not like it at all. if you have not seen this movie. then i recommend that you don't
1,Dopey nonsense,"Sorry, I thought this was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It went nowhere, said nothing and made me feel like scraping my nails along the wall. No review has made me understand why people think this is a great film. I think people who say they like it just want to appear cool and hip. They would also have said that the emperor was wearing beautiful clothes. Do yourself a favor: Go pick up your dog's poop off the lawn instead of watching this movie."
1,empty and not funny,"This ""comedy"" is boring, stale, and not funny. Its emphasis on ""surrealism"" and absurdity is a sign that the director had to concoct his film in a way to persuade everyone that he actually had someting to say. While watching how the rich folks could never get down to a serious dinner, I got hungry (and angry) myself. Don't waste your time."
4,Thoroughly entertaining satire of idle lives,"Thoroughly entertaining satire of idle lives. . .Except when they are smuggling and trafficking in drugs, the bunch in the movie do nothing other than PREPARE to have a meal, which keeps eluding them.Very entertaining with its non-sequitors and absurdities."
5,Bunuel doing what he does best,"Luis Bunuel was an old hand by this time at making surrealistic, dream-dominated comedies, and he throws this one off with seeming ease. His targets are the usual ones: the rich, the church, the military, and diplomacy, but he is more playful here and mellow rather than savage in his satire. A group of rich people (one of the men is an ambassador of a fictitious South American country and all the men are involved with drug smuggling) is trying to sit down to a meal together (at various times), but they keep getting interrupted - by terrorists, the army, the police, even by a corpse. It's weird and crazy, but it works. As to be expected, the dream sequences are the best and funniest things in the movie. It won the Acadamy Award for best foreign picture and deservedly so."
4,Executeable,"Luis Bunuel's major theme in this film is showing his dislikefor the 'bourgeois' segment of society. A similar theme wasshown about 5 years after ""Discreet Charm""'s premiere, althoughmore playfully, in Bunuel's ""That Obscure Object of Desire.""In what seems to be a dreamlike scene in ""Discreet Charm"",a group of defenseless 'bourgeois' friends is machine gunnedwithout reason. Did the director think the friendsdeserved the punishment?"
2,Louis Malle did it far better,"Watch Malle's ""May Fools"" (Milou En Mai) instead-- similar theme, but much better. I like Bunuel's work for the most part, but I thought this one a dud. Later, after picking up the Region 2 Louis Malle vol 2 collection which has Milou En Mai, I enjoyed all the films and thought Milou En Mai would be better named, ""The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie""..."
4,The One Year War in The Eyes of a Child,"This six episode series, literally 2 hours long, coulda been a theatrical feature, takes place during the One Year War. He becomes entangled with what is usually considered an enemy soldier in the Gundam Universe, Zeon. He takes on a mission to help the Zeons find a new prototype Gundam named NT-1 Alex, and capture or destroy it. There are some battles in this short OVA that truly illustrate what combat does to a colony, but also political blowback, all from the eyes of a child barely out of elementary school. From what starts as a normal day that suddenly turns a city into a war zone, the two will begin a short journey that will lead up to a fatal final encounter. This OVA is filled with suspense, action, and sorrow."
2,Cutter was not sharp,"The cutter was not so sharp so it is quite difficult to punch and size is very small, so you will need very thin ribbon"
4,handy items,I have a selection of over 200 bin most are akrobins some are other brand but akrobins are holding up over time test real well
3,Does NOT fit the PC7500 machine,I don't have this foot and I'm glad I didn't buy it. I checked the Brother site and the PC7500 that I own is a 7mm feed dog machine and this foot doesn't fit it even though it is included in the list of machines above.
1,Didn't Work for Me.,I just could not get this to work for me. I did have to return it which was an easy process.
2,"just a zig-zag foot with 1/4"" guide","This is just a zig-zag foot with an attached 1/4"" guide. It does not stitch a line in the fabric. You must use the zig-zag setting on your machine. If you try to use a straight stitch setting, the needle will break when it hits the center metal piece. There is a small bar in the middle of the zig-zag area so you cannot straight stitch. OK value for the price but should not be confused with an overlock stitch."
5,Music to my ears,Pure enjoyment! Composition was smooth and relaxing not just random plucking you find from other artist. Well worth addition to any classical colleciton.
1,I got Snaked,"This cable looks good, feels good, is easy to use, but only works if the ends are wiggled and twisted. I could not get it to connect correctly on two different amps and one electric guitar. Pass on this one. A lesson learned; you get what you pay for!"
4,Decent cable,"This works well, and appears to be pretty well put together. It does have a very plasic-y feel due to the outer casing, though, and is not as flexible as what I am used to. I just needed a couple cheap cables for rehearsal and these fit the bill."
5,Excellent book for Linux beginners,"It's very comprehensive book teaching the beginners to install, use and administrate the Linux OS.It covers Installation with Lizard properly. Also, it is impressive for us that the book teaches how to use Zip drive and CD-R drive! And it contains the Hardware Compatibility List at the end for the readers.As for beginners only, it doesn't have lots of Linux commands for reference. But it has teaches some configuration about the servers and LAN.Although Caldera Openlinux is not as popular as Redhat or Corel's , but it is very easy to use with the KDE window, COAS and Webmin. With such an easy-to-understand book, there should be more users starting using the Linux OS.It is better than the Dummies book which just teaches installation only! I highly recommend it for daily reference."
5,Caldera OpenLinux Installation and Configuration Handbook,As a system administrator I have not found a more useful book for this distribution. Never mind this is my favorite distribution.
3,It backfired for us!,"Someone gave this to our daughter, who is also named Frances. She absolutely loves the book, but now all she wants to eat is bread and jam. She used to eat at least PB&J, but now she skips the peanut butter. (Occasionally she'll refuse PB&J but agree to bread and jam with peanutbutter. Ha!) What do we do???"
2,This version is abridged.,"While I love the original version of this book, I was sorely disappointed to find that the ""I Can Read"" version that I purchased is abridged. Several charming lines are deleted and there are no markings to indicate that it's abridged except in the fine print of the copyright information."
4,Great book,"I was disappointed that I couldn't find the original version of this book to buy on amazon, but this abridged version isn't a bad one. Our kids love this book and request it often. Having a picky eater in the house makes meals a struggle sometimes; it is cute to refer to Frances and how she realizes that variety in trying new foods makes life interesting! Great writing style and one of my favorite illustrations comes near the end if the book... How wonderful to see Frances pull out a decadent lunch at school (wish I had lunches like that) along with a nice tablecloth and small vase of flowers! If only!! Highly recommend."
5,Love it!,Poor Frances figures out what it means to get too much of a good thing! My kids and I read this book 4 times the day we received it. And we quote it often. Love it!
5,Wonderful Classic filled with Humor,"I loved the Frances books growing up and now my two-year is enjoying them. I just read Bread and Jam to her and she loves it, especially the songs Frances sings (I sing them to the tune of Mary has a Little Lamb). I love the parenting advice in the book, too. We love the description of the lunches these little badgers unpack and eat at school. I love the quality of the illustrations and the writing. I think it's children's book writing at the best. So many books now are just plain silly!"
4,Childhood favorite,I remember this book from my childhood and thought I'd order it to indulge in a little nostalgia. It's such a great book for teaching children about variety and new experiences.
2,Assembly is a bit tricky,"Disappointed that I found it impossible to assemble the stands. You have to watch out that there are different length pre-drilled holes at the different ends of the pillars. I also didn't have an extensive toolkit to be able to redrill and enlarge the pre-drilled holes to make the assembly much easier. Things were so tight, I couldn't drive the screws in even with a powertool. Otherwise they looked good quality construction and should suit smaller sized rear surround speakers. With appropriate planning you should be able to avoid breaking screws like I did. Onecall don't pay for return shipping and Sanus were happy to send replacement parts, but I decided to return the item anyway. Maybe you'll have more success."
5,Sanus stands=thumbs up. :),The Sanus stands work great for me. I got two pairs for my surround sound system. Assembly was easy and I had no problems with the wood splitting like others claim. Appearance is great although they could use some kind of mount in the back for stability but for the price these can't be beat.
3,Decent Iron Maiden fare...,"It seems that Bruce Dickinson had very little input as far as songwriting for this album is concerned(see credits).Even though it is probably the most keyboard-layered Maiden album and certainly not on a par with their glorious pre-1985 albums,it features a number of songs which are veritable gems,i.e.,'Stranger in A Strange Land','Alexander the Great'."
3,"Ok, but not great","Out of the first seven Maiden studio albums, this one is my least favorite. There are several good tunes on here but it falls a little short. If you listen to all the Maiden albums in chronological order, you can sense a little departure with a more popular sound on this album, which is not uncommon for most bands to do. They did put out an improved follow up with Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. Nonetheless, It's ok at best. I'm just a fan of the older Maiden music. Albums such as Killers and Piece Of Mind is the true classic Maiden sound that attracted their fanbase to begin with."
3,Only one flaw,"The only flaw in this album is its real lack of ""power"" and ""energy"". Is has no ""punch"". Artistically, it is perfect, considering Maiden style of songwriting. But it sounds weak, like if the musicians were tired, very strange... It was the beggining of the creativity downfall, briefly forgotten by the masterpiece ""Seventh Son"""
4,when i feel deja vu,"i love this in time, because its give me inspiration that i have strange phenomenon so-called 'deja-vu'.through this song i often seek out the information about my phenomenon and thank God i find it. i love all the song cos here they use snyth, which add the thrill of the album, the cover is so futuristic, maybe we have this such kind of robot in the future, i hope so.'wasted years' make me realize how i wasted my time,"
5,wow,"alright, so i dont own the album (yet). but thanks to the internet ive been able to preview most of the songs on the album. wow. very melodic metal, which is definitely a good thing. i agree with other reviews that Wasted Years may have been made to get them into the mainstream, but good none-the-less. By far my favorite song on the cd is The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner. You can only truly appreciate it if youv run a cross country race, but i imagine its a good song if you havent too. This song basically sums up all the highlights of a good race, and when listening to it it always brings back images of races ive been in. its just amazing how well he made the song seem like your in a race. even during the breaks i feel like im running. anyways, i plan on listneing to this song before avery race i run in from now on, its amazing."
4,"Man, what a improvement!!!","This CD suffered a brutal improvement with this remastered / enhanced version, when comparing it to its original CD release. The songs are more crips, the bass line and drums more hard, the difference is breathtaking.This album is surely a little forgotten by Maiden fans (like POWERAGE for AC/DC, for instance), but, in both cases, they are terrific albums.I enjoy all the eight songs here, I think none of them are filler (contrary to the Maiden releases of the nineties, that were chock full of fillers). GREAT ALBUM."
5,Maiden's best?,"This is my favorite Maiden album. This is the album where Maiden discovered synthesizers ... but they integrated the keys much less invasively than say, Van Halen did on ""1984"". This album does NOT lack for ferocity - it's still the same manic Maiden all out attack. But - the overall sound has become more complete and multi dimensional - something more closely resembling MUSIC - albeit ferocious music."
5,Good Shape,"This was a tough title to track down, even used. It took a while to come in, but I'm glad I took the time to find it and thanks to this provider for keeping it in excellent condition. The CD, though used, was in flawless condition, plays through full, is obviously not a clever copy, has nary a scratch on it and sounds wonderful. Thanks!"
5,They wouldn't follow him into India........,"Alexander the Great could've easily been an instrumental, it's such a greta song. Bruce's vocals on every song are just dead on. Amazing record, I think any music fan could appreciate this excellent piece of music, go buy it and enjoy!"
5,Iron Maiden does Progressive Metal,"In this album Maiden has started something new that went on in the following album, 7th son of a 7th son. Somewhere in Time is less heavy than the other Maiden Albums though more melodic and complex, the addition of syth guitars gives it a ""special"" sound. the album is diffrent, but one of the best albums of Iron Maiden and for sure an Heavy Metal masterpiece. The highlights in my opinion are: Heaven Can Wait, The Lonleliness of the Long Distance Runner, and Alexander the great(Chack out Adrian's Solo on that one! )."
4,Great one to buy,"This is a great album, it's kind of different from the albums before Somewhere in Time, cos on this one they just some nice keyboard and synthesizer effects. This is a must have if you like Iron Maiden. Takes you right back to the good old days!"
1,Stay away from the remaster,"If I wanted to hear a loud mass of indiscriminate white noise I'd listen to a Nine Inch Nails album. When I listen to an Iron Maiden album I'd actually like to hear the singer and the individual instruments layered on one another. This 2002 remaster is overly loud, compressed, and digitized. Stick with the original CD."
3,Not Very Good,"Considering that before this album Iron Maiden was one of the greatest bands on the face of the earth, it is not expected for them to have a 3 star album. But here on this, they go right ahead and do it. This is not the Iron Maiden that did Powerslave and Number of The Beast. This is a new, melodic, progressive sound. The sound is not as heavy or metal-centric as its predessesors. It sounds more like a synthed-out Queensryche or Rush. It's melodic metal, not really heavy, brutal metal like they had been making. Wasted Years, the title track, and Stranger In a Strange Land are great, but the rest is just too different for me to like. I'm just telling you, this is not the real Iron Maiden. The real sound of Iron Maiden is what they showcased on Number Of The Beast, Powerslave, etc."
3,THE LOST ALBUM,"This MAiden's lost album. Why? Because it is ""lost"" between the two master-pieces ""Powerslave"" and ""Seventh Son of a Seventh Son"". As a result, it seems a floppy CD, but it has his great moments, like ""ALexander The Great""."
1,Somewhere Lame,"The best thing about this album is the artwork on the cover. I remember way back in high school, I couldn't wait for this album to come out. I had been reared on Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, and Powerslave, and I thought this album would have to be awesome. Instead, I got this synthesizer laden recording with only the faintest hints of the Maiden I had come to know and love.The lyrics are hackneyed at best (witness the clumsy ""Heaven Can Wait"" and the tortuous ""Alexander the Great"") All the songs here are smothered in synthesizer, which just doesn't fit Maiden's metal style. It's like they found a new toy and didn't know when to stop using it.To this day, I don't understand why there are no Dickinson songs included here. He started using his song-writing skills on Piece of Mind, but he penned nothing here. Perhaps he heard the direction the band was going and decided not to waste his talents."
2,A poor Maiden Record,"The best thing about this dissappointing Maiden record is the cover, which contains a complete history of the band, up to that point. The record itself seemed to me to be an excuse to go on tour. Unfortunately, not one song stands out. I would pass on this one for the new Maiden fan, but the more hardcore may enjoy this one."
1,Maiden Lose Me,"It was all downhill from here. Bruce is worn out from the Slavery tour and the songs just don't cut it. There's hardly a decent lick on the album and there no fun in it. They seem to be having so much more fun on Powerslave, particularly with: Back in the Village, Aces, 2 Minutes.Harris has run out of ideas: Alexander is just a terrible rehash of Rime of the Ancient Mariner. And what went wrong with chorus's; repeating a song's title over and over again: ""Heaven Can Wait! Heaven Can Wait! Heaven Can Wait!"" or ""Caught Somewhere in Time! Caught Somewhere in Time! Caught Somewhere in Time!"" is just lame.Me and my mates tried to like this when it came out. But in the end it was no good...the next album was just as weak. End of Maiden and Metallica just blew them away with Puppets."
2,SOMEWHERE IN TIME,CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME-7/10WASTED YEARS-5/10SEA OF MADNESS-6/10HEAVEN CAN WAIT-5/10THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER-5/10STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND-6/10DEJA VU-5/10ALEXANDER THE GREAT-6/10
4,A transitional album,"Somewhere In Time came between what I consider to be the two best albums in the Iron Maiden catalog. On this one, they use synthesizers for the first time, and for the most part it works. Whereas the synthesizers became more a part of the main structure of the music on Seventh Son, on this album they're used mostly for texture.Strip away the electronics, and you're left with good ol' fashioned Maiden: Steve's propulsive, in-your-face bass, Dave and Adrian's guitars either in harmony or trading solos, Bruce's soaring voice and Nicko's drumming. The band shared writing duties on this one more equitably than they did on past albums, although there's not a single writing credit for Bruce.As for the songs, my favorites are the first two, ""Caught Somewhere In Time"" and ""Wasted Years"". Pretty much all the material here is good, but I have to take a couple points off ""Alexander The Great""; the music is terrific, but the lyrics read like an encyclopedia entry."
4,Feel Like I've Been Here Before...,"After the album ""Powerslave"" (which was their best album to date) they released an album that many people say that was their worst one in 80's. I don't hate it but I have to say that it isn't my favorite Maiden albums. It is in my top7 Maiden albums but still...maybe the worst 80's Maiden. It has many great songs. It is great that they had courage to release this kind of an album which had songs like ""Wasted Years"" and ""De Ja Vu"" which may had put a shadow over the band. However, they succeeced to release a good album. It's not ""Beast"" or ""Powerslave"" but it's a good album. None of the 80's Maiden albums was bad.Stars: Wasted Years, Stranger in a Strange Land, Caught Somewhere in Time"
3,New Remastering Sorely Needed.,"Don't get me wrong. This album deserves all 5 stars and there's no argument about that. But considering the fantastic sound quality of the original vinyl copy and the marvelous job Martin Birch did on the production of the album, this remastered CD version clearly misses the mark in sound quality. A new remastering is desperately needed for digital fans."
5,classic,"I don't know what Adrian Smith did,..., but his playing improved exponentially from Powerslave. I love this CD-the guitars sound great and modern. The production is excellent, as good as Piece of Mind (I think Powerslave is a step back in sound quality, although it's ver Maiden's best by far for contents). Top class metal here. Ultraclassic, don't miss this one. All those wasted years..."
3,A good collection,"Here's a classic collection of works from Goldman. I thought the essay on Anarchism was the weakest of the lot. Her views on patriotism and crime/prisons were inspiring and her essays on feminism really challenged me to keep going back and reexamining what I believe.It is probably worth reading for context and perspective on her time and ours and for another lens through which to examine society. Anarchism is a crock though, Right-Libertarianism dressed up in the fancy words of the left. She would have made Ayn Rand proud."
5,Thought provoking,"You don't have to be an anarchist to be able to take something away from this author. Well worth taking the time to download and read (the price speaks for itself, no?)."
1,Not worth the paper it was printed on,"The only thing this book is good for is explaining an overview of IP multicasting to a non-technical audience. If you're wanting to learn Multicasting to deploy in a real network, then this isn't the book."
1,Sorry Read,"I was extremely disapointed with this book. It was poorly written and not worth the paper it was written on. It appears that Dr. Parkhurst has a limited amount of practical experience. In fact, I ended up throwing this book away.Beau Williamson's book on Multicasting is a much better read and a whole lot more informative."
5,Excellent work from the master,"A truly wonderful book. James writes profound essays on all aspects of baseball. He cuts through the nonsense that ignorant journalists write and say about baseball. He proves he can write intelligently on baseball without throwing statistics at the reader.The book is basically four parts: reviews of the state of the baseball teams in the 1980s which is somewhat obsolete, critical comments on baseball players and managers, various essays on all aspects of baseball, and various studies discussing issues like the platooning advantage and the effect of stolen bases on team performance. Disdaining baseball ""purists"" , he offers controversial ideas, some of which he continues to put forth in his recent New Historical Baseball Abstract.Even though this was written almost 20 years ago, it is still relevant today. If you are a fan of good baseball writing, you should pick this up ASAP."
4,A Very Good Read About The Pass,This gives you a great insight into Marias Pass. It was a very good read if this part of our country interests you. I enjoyed it.
1,Nothing special,I found SQL Server 7.0 Resource guide to be short on specifics and would describe it as a general overview of 7.0. To troubleshoot problems with replication I had to refer to previous versions of Inside SQL Sever 6.5. If you already know SQL server from pervious versions this book will not add much to your library.
4,Unbreakable soul,"First I wonder where all the other reviews are of this true soul artist? This album is for all you lovers of the soul sound from the mid 80's, with a little touch of Stevie (the song ""Unbreakable"" is an example of this - also my favourite). ""Me Oh My"" has a truly nice vibe - the music in this one just fills you up with a feeling of SOUL. ""Peace in the Heart"" is one of the good songs, as ""Love Makes the World Go Round"", which became a smaller hit and was well-played on MTV in early 90's. You who like nu-soul like Maxwell, Olu and Chico DeBarge should check this one out."
5,a great treat,As a child of the eighties I grew up with He Man and She Ra and I wanted to share these cartoons with my own children. What a great thing to be able to do. My daughter who is four has watched this cartoon so many times I think she has it memorized. We will definintley be adding more She Ra to our collection.
4,He-Man & She-Ra Christmas Special,"For the collector of this classic 80's kids programming, it's a great addition. Cheap enough to justify the purchase just for the sake of it. Good enough for your Christmas videos for the kids. }:o)"
5,Even She-Ra celebrates christmas with He-Man,At least something of She-Ra is out on dvd. I will love the christmas special when it comes out December 6. I think both her and He-Man make a cute couple.
5,He-Man rules,If you are a He-Man fan then you will love the X-Mas special. This is one of the best He-Man's yet!
1,Do not buy this book if you do no know C,"I bought this book to learn Java, not to know the author's views on programming. I got really tired hearing how you do it in C. THIS IS NOT A BEGINNER'S BOOK. I have now bought Murach's Java book, it has examples and brings you along. Learning Java does not even tell you how to run the SDK. I wrote the publisher and got a mispelled all lower case reply. A note for Patrick Niemeyer, real programmers do use ""goto"". Try assembler without it.Jeff Ward"
2,NOT A Learning Book,"This book would have been better had it not included ""Learning"" in the title. This is not a book for learning how to program in Java. Instead, this book plays a lot more like an overview of core concepts in Java for practicing programmers. This book would probably have been better suited in the ""Nutshell"" series, but even as a reference, it's a rather weak text because it keeps pretending to be instructional. This book is pointless.This book is absolutely not for novice programmers. You have to have some experience with the C/C++ language and OOP concepts to really get the meat of this book.This book does include a *few* things that are nice for novices to know, but it's nothing you won't find in any other book on the topic."
4,Could Benefit From More Examples,"This book is a bit dense for an absolute beginner, but with a little prep it's pretty good. However, I wish it had more complete examples of how to use the various language capabilities."
4,good,"for those have some experenced in language,its has good concept and gental introduction to java"
3,Nothing special about this book.,"The editorial above pretty much sums up this book, ""Learning Java ...does a competent job of introducing the language to beginners."" I've been programming for 4 years using C/C++ and Perl and I have bought O'Reilly books in the past (for you Perl newbies, check out O'Reilly's ""Learning Perl""). I usually feel I can't go wrong with O'Reilly so I picked up ""Learning Java"" without a second thought.So far I've read half of ""Learning Java"" and while there are moments the book shines, there are many more where it doesn't. It's not a bad book, but I'm hoping there's a better one out there."
3,Waaaaaaay too fast....,"I've been learning Java for half a year now, and I found this book to be going way to fast. Chapters 1 - 3, covers somewhat complex concepts such as multi-threading, interfaces and policy files. But only in chapter 4 do they explain the primitive types.This is not a tutorial for beginners. You have to know considerably amount of Java before you can fully understand all the concepts in this book. The good thing is that they jump into OOP immediately, and explaining it very thoroughly.My last bad point about this book is that when they give you an example, usually about 2 pages long, and you have about 15% of an idea of what's going on. Fortunately, they do provide an explanation, however it's usually about 15 pages long. The examples are way too complicated for chapter 1 - 3.The language is very technical, but it seems easy enough to understand when you think carefully about it. Not a horrible, but also not too good of a book."
4,Very good 2nd or 3rd read on Java,"This is a well written book which can be heartily recommended as a valuable addition to any Java programmer's bookshelf. The title is however somewhat misleading in that it is not necessarily the best choice as a first read on the topic. The discussion can at times be a bit terse and tend slightly towards abstractness. (Some books which probably better fit the bill as first read on Java would be Deitels' ""Java How to Program"", or Horton's ""Beginning Java""). This book is an ideal compliment to a primary tutorial such as Dietel or Horton, offering valuable advice in the way of programming style, and subtleties, and serving as a summary/refresher of the concepts that have been already met but perhaps in need of revision."
1,Not worth the time or money,"As with most people, I usually dig O'Reilly books, but I made a big mistake here. Unlike other ""Leaning"" books, Learning PERL for example, this learning book did more to put me to sleep rather than teach me anything about Java. There were really only examples in the first chapter, then it lost it's track and felt more like someone's thesis on the subject than a real commercial book.This book was very successful at turning me away from Java and O'Reilly for a while, until I found ""Head First Java"". If your looking to learn about Java, look at Head First, it's much better, fun and you actually learn something about java, good programming, OO and all the great subjects that come along with those."
3,Content is good.,"The book has excellent content regarding all facets of the Java language. However, the writing and overall order of the book leaves much to be desired. As others have suggested, this book should not be used by a novice Java developer. I would suggest a book with better examples etc. such as Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days, or if you're partial to O'Reilly books you might want to look at Java Examples in a Nutshell."
4,My First Book about Java,"This is my first book about Java, it with me for about 3 years, and I like O'Reilly's tech books.Use today's sight to say this book is out of date, for Java has updated to 1.5, but for that days I learn Java, it is great.And I don't think this book is good enough for programming beginners, the reader must have some knowledge of programming."
2,Poor Book for O'Reilly,"First off, I've had 6 years of C/C++, Perl, and a Little Oracle experience. After picking up O'Reilly's Learning Perl book, I was more than Dissappointed with this one. The chapters don't seem to follow any logical flow. Way too much concept and overhead for very little gain. They started explaining concepts and in depth details, before covering basic syntax. Most people who pick up these books have a basic understanding of programming, and are more interested in the syntax of a language. Once you know one language (the semantics), most other languages are fairly similar. Yet, the authors of this book wanted to explain inheritance (both Single inheritance and the ability of multiple inheritance via the implements opertor) when they haven't even covered the basic syntax of the language like strings and arrays. This is very illogical. It's almost as if they explained points a, and points F and tried to work their way to the middle."
3,"""Learning JAVA?"" - not quite","Not up to the standards of ""Learning Python"" and many of the other exceptional O'Reilly titles. This book is not one to pick up and hope to learn the language. The authors concentrate heavily on idiosyncracies and skim over basic principles. In particular, the Swing chapters were a bitter disappointment - the JAPPLET example shows not the skeleton for a working JAPPLET, but how to run an applet inside a swing program. The Lister example combines JLIST and JCOMBOBOX into a garbled example. It's not easy for the novice to peel out one and convert it to a JAPPLET...If you know JAVA and want a reference, this book may help. If you want to know what's new in JAVA2, this book may be for you. I'm waiting for the update to JAVA Examples in a Nutshell and still looking for a good introductory book."
3,Hard To Get Started,"First off, I have experience with programming in C/C++ and a few other languages and I'm familiar with the basic ideas of object-oriented programming. But this book was not one I could start learning Java from. I ended up reading Dori Smith's Java 2 For The World Wide Web (the Visual QuickStart Guide) and had a much easier time figuring out the basics of Java. That book was easy to understand although it's extremely limited in scope.That said, I think the biggest problem I had with ""Learning Java"" was the steep learning curve at the beginning. The very first examples seem more complicated than they really need to be. That makes it very easy to give up and go looking for another book. If you already know a little bit about Java, then you probably won't be scared off but if this is your first time trying to learn Java, your best bet is to look elsewhere first and come back to this later."
2,"Fast paced, complicated examples ...","Succinct presentation, the examples are way complicated for newbies. I am a C programmer in a HP-UX Unix environment, and has taken a one week crash course in JAVA. I've read around 4 books - Teachyourself in 21 days(lemay), Java 2 How to program(deitel), Beginning Java(horton) and Java for Dummies. This book doesn't come close to those four when the target audience is a newbie. Take the hello world example, this one can be displayed using a simple JOptionPane class, but in ""Learning..."" the code is too much for beginner. Take my advice, buy Lemay's and Jacquie Barker's Beginning Java Objects and you'll thank me for it."
4,Excellent book for experienced programmers,"This is an excellent book for experienced programmers looking for a good introduction to the Java language. If you have previous experience with C, C++, or even C#, you will have little problem dissecting this book.The organization is one thing I really did like about this book. If you know you will do a lot with servlets but little with Swing, you can skip the section on UI and concentrate on the web section.I found this to be a through and well written introduction to Java for the experienced programmer. This book should cover most new developer's Java needs, through understanding the language to writing applications, to even understanding JavaBeans."
2,Not Good for Beginners.,I don't recommend this book for beginners because:1) Less no. of examples with more complexity.2) Object Oriented Concepts not covered very well.3) The way topics are discussed is not so comprehensive and lack continuity.
5,Awesome,The keychain is hand stitched and the quality is great and its big enough that you will not lose your key or keys again. Great Product. Buy it if your a Manson fan.
4,Better Than How It First Looks,"On the surface, this looks like an overly violent, dumb and seedy movie because it features nothing but hardened criminals plus the normal sadistic warden Hollywood always shows in all modern-day films.But....it turns out the story isn't as sordid as it looks and the violence, although plentiful, is somehow not overdone. Also, the chief villain "" Walter Marek"" (Stuart Wilson) is a man with a good sense of humor. The comedic relief he brings is a real plus to the story. By the way, Wilson doesn't look like Mel Gibson but his voice sure sounds similar.Profanity isn't as much as you'd except in a tough film like this and - in a real oddity - Lance Henriksen is the nicest guy in the movie! He never utters a bad or angry word. If you know the characters Henriksen usually plays, you know this is a rarity. Ray Liotta, Michael Lerner and Ernie Hudson also star, so it's a decent cast.You could do a lot worse looking for two hours of ""escapist"" fare."
3,Just fun to watch,"This is a movie to watch just for kicks. It possesses no Oscar merit, but it definately fills that warm spot in a B-movie man's soul. One must admit Lance Henrikson is definately one sci-fi/fantasy/thriller acter who is just plain interesting to observe. I just have one disturbing question about originality. Why steal the classic arena scene from Spartacus? Were we that desperate for something that demands great merit? All in all, a fun watch."
5,A Must for Sci-fi Fantasy Fans!,"This move was entertaining. Liotta was great and the villian was one of the best I have seen. He should do more movies as a villian. Great script and diologue. To the other reviewers, you should feel sorry for the prisoners. They are human and desirve to be treated with some dignity."
5,Superb Action!!,"Few action movies have the plot and characterization as this one does. You actually get a great story, likeable good guys, and plausible twists and turns that makes this one of the best action movies I've ever seen. It definately is in my top 5 movies of all time (Aliens and T2 being tie for first)"
3,escape on your own will,"the first 15 minutes are boring but when Liotta goes into the outsiders camp and has some fun its great. Lots of violence with dull character villians but Stuart Wilson is a hoot as the head baddude. burns some with some pretty horrible dialoug but then theres still goodies, with the highlight being when Stuart and his men come into the insiders camp and find noone but Liotta and one of their weapons, Liotta fires and boom, great scene."
2,I don't feel sorry for killers and rapists,"Ray Liota is the only convict I felt remotely sorry for since he had a good reason, but the others were just scumb, like his friend, Casey who helped in a kidnapping,should have told the police that something was wrong, the only thing that saved this movie from being a turkey was the good fight scenes"
2,Escape From This Mediocre Film!,"Unimpressive film with a rather predictable plot. Ray Liotta has been wrongly convicted of a crime and is sent to an island-prison colony divided into two camps: unreformable criminals and reformed, peace-seeking, criminals. It is evident by Ray Liotta's character and his predicament that this is a good guy vs. bad guys movie. The dialogue is, for the most part weak, and the film is too long. For a movie of this sort, I would recommend watching ""Escape from New York"" or ""Running Man"" instead: they're shorter, have better stories, and better actors all together."
4,A Must for a Ray Liotta fan,"This is a great movie for both action lovers and drama lovers, it has tons of action. The plot is also good. The DVD edition is much better than the VHS version, the sound is the only drawback. However, I highly recomend it to your DVD collection."
2,Good action,This movie was boring and a borderline B movie. Some good action scenes but they are not enough to even warrant a 99 cent rental. It is no wonder the widescreen version is priced so low. Im surprised they even put it out in widescreen.
3,It's a Wrench,"This wrench is fine. It grasps like it should, and is decent for the money, but it is by no means a great wrench. They didn't smooth the edges of it (where the mold was) as well as they could have, and the head wiggles. Fine to have, but you might want to spend more for a better wrench - especially if you're a heavy user."
3,"Decent workbook, but negative signs are too small",The negative signs on the numbers are way too small. I'm having to go through the book and enlarge all the negative signs so we don't miss them.
3,Good book for upper middle school,I purchased the book to supplement my 5th grade curriculum. Majority of the book is too advanced for my class. A few logic puzzles and a couple pages with expressions are appropriate.
2,maybe just as a review,"If you are teaching your child, you will need to recall the algebra terminology as this book does not provide that... only a few problems to practice on each section...."
4,colorful and a great learning tool,"THIS BOOK WAS PURCHASED FOR MY 3 1/2 YEAR OLD GRAND CHILD. SHE LOVED IT..FROM THE BEAUTIFUL COVER TO THE CHARACTERS INSIDE, SHE WAS A DELIGHT TO WATCH AS SHE POINTED TO THE PHOTOS AND TURNED THE PAGES. HER EASTER WAS COMPLETE WITH THIS BOOK IN HER BASKET.SHE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT EACH SCENE AS WE READ TO HER. THANKS FOR SUCH ADELIGHTFUL AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND BOOK."
3,"Love this old classic, but not the original illustrations","I had fond memories of this little book (and one called The Whispering Rabbit), and the images were etched in my mind, so I searched for them to have to read to my little ones. I was thrilled to find both books, and ordered them, only to be disapointed that the illustrations were not the same as I remembered. Upon further research, I found the original on ebay in a book titled The Whispering Rabbit and Other Stories by Margaret Wise Brown, Copyright Weekly Reader Book Club Edition, 1965. The Book includes the 2 aforementioned stories, and The Friendly Book, Scuppers Song, and Rabbit Poem."
2,Not one of the better books on this subject...,"After reading the reviews for this book, I couldn't wait for it to arrive so I could read it. How dissappointing it was! Although I found small parts of this book to helpful, the majority of it was silly. The author talks about NEVER contacting a suicide; what if a family member crossed from suicide? He places alot on the ouija board, how he conjured cowboys who onced lived in his apartment! There just doesn't seem to be alot of truth, as well as the fact that alot of it is just plain boring."
1,Worthles!,"This book has very little to do with mediumship! At best it's a general overview of all things psychic. There are no instructions or exercises. Most of the chapters are on unrelated topics, even the chapters on mediumship aren't actually about mediumship and instead focus on why you'd want to become a medium, why you'll want to work hard as a medium, and ways to dress as a medium."
5,THE THIN MEMBRANE,"""...The chaos and calm basic to the collection intersect throughout the book, interrogating the boundaries of a presented life and a life under the surface. ""Ourself behind ourself, concealed-- / Should startle most--"" wrote Emily Dickinson. Perfect Disappearance startles exactly so."""
3,Read the book in two days!!!,"I really enjoyed the book! It was smooth and easy reading. I also found the book very interesting. Most importantly, the book was about many life lessons. It was interesting to watch the main character (Maggie) grow up from a college student to a lead nurse at a major hospital. As an audience, I watched Maggie endure heartbreak and loss and bouce back. It was also interesting to see the dynamics between women and women, and men and women. Overall, I just found the book pleasant, light and fun reading. It was also well-written and flowed naturally. I am looking forward to Mrs. Grace-Jones' next book!"
5,This Book Has Changed Lives,"The concepts presented in this book are difficult for many people to believe and accept. That alone should drive anyone who reads it to the Bible in search of the truth. If you choose not to search the Bible for yourself (on any subject), then only you are to blame if you lose eternal life. Even if you don't believe what is written in this book, there are many people who have recieved it, in one way or another, and changed their lives. People in prison have recieved Christ because of this book. People have been brought out from Satan worship because of this book. To a Christian, that alone should make the book valuable. If this book causes a person to begin to study the Bible, then God has used it for His will. Daily study of God's Word (the Bible) and prayer changes lives. It will show anyone the way to salvation. If this book has done that for even one person, then it is worth all the time, money and resources used to print and mail it to millons of people."
5,Truth for this time,This is a very misunderstood book because people think it's about hate or something when it is all about a loving warning from God because He wants to save everyone and doesn't want the advesary to deceive. Wide is the gate that leads to destruction and narrow is the path that leads to life and few find it. It is all about Satan's lies and desire to put his throne above God's and it is a great deception. Only those truly seeking truth will see it for what it is. May God have mercy on those who are ignorantly refusing this message.
1,Completely demonic,"While it does correctly teach saturday is G-d's sabbath, this book takes a scriptural truth to deceive people and uses it to promote satanic doctrines. I received this book as a ""free bonus"" when I ordered another book at a different site --- I immediately saw it was written by demons and I ripped it up and threw it away (amazingly it came with a book that was 100% scriptural which I ordered several more of from amazon)This is an example of a book that was written by demons and masquerades as Christian."
2,Insteresting data but don't believe it is all based on bible,"Interesting but perfer the bible for ""by the book"" leadershi"
5,THE BOOK FOR THE NEW MILLINIEM,"This book is quite an eye opener. I found it to be backed by the truth of the scriptures and prophecies. As Jesus said ""If you love me, Keep my commandments"" and "" I have come to fulfill the law, not abolish it"" Also, note the fact that Jesus was a Sabbath Keeper. This shows that The Ten Commandments are still valid, and meant to be kept. This book goes into excellent detail of the 4th commandment, explaining why it does matter which day we worship."
4,Enchanting,"I read this book at least a decade ago but it left a lasting impression. In it, we follow the story of an adolsecent girl as she wanders into the frozen north on a quest to save her village. Reality seems to disolve as time progresses and it becomes almost dream like. I liked it. Great book for a winter's night."
5,Good,"Let me first start off by saying that this book is *NOT* meant for beginning Access/VB/VBA/SQL users. It is assumed that this book is geared towards intermediate Access/VB/VBA/SQL users.This book does one thing well in that it knows that DAO is not the future and that ADO is (for the time beginning). It spends plenty of time on detailing ADO for both Access and SQL Server.I like the fact that it deals with Access front-ends to SQL Server backends. It even takes a chapter from Kalen Delaney's masterful Inside SQL Server 7 book on SQL Server architecture.All in all, if you consider yourself at least on an intermediate programmer with the aforementioned technologies, this book will not gather dust on your bookshelf.All in all, a job well done."
5,"Awesome product, fast deliverary, great service:)","As always tupperware exceeds all other plastic products. The lids stay on nice and tight and the risk of spilliage is miminial. It is the perfect product for older children to enjoy beverages as well as for parents to not worry about them spilling. Great service from the seller, I recommend their services!!"
5,Bookshelf speaker stand,Great stands they feel solid great price worth every penny my polk audio speakers look great with these stands the top base could be a hair longer and wider other than that I recommend these stands hides the speaker wires too.
2,"Very disappointed, where is the Noel I know ??????","if you love the Noel of ""silent morning"", ""like a child"" and ""city street""--then you will be very disappointed at this one. it got 2 stars from me because it had one good song ! ""valentine"", thats all I have to say, the rest sounded like B class rock n roll."
4,Great folding table!,"I have used this table many times while camping or spending a day at the park. It is very handy, easy to assemble, and stores away in it's own carrying bag. The construction is fairly solid, and if treated properly will last for quite awhile. The only problem is the wood slats are not treated or fininshed so if it gets wet it may rot. I would recommend this table to anyone who camps or picnics."
2,A letdown,"Doesn't even remotely compare (IMVHO) to her ecstatic 1999 live offering, Electrica. The only saving grace is ""Para De Chorar,"" the very funky club-style bonus track. Even favorites that could've saved this set (like usually-amazing ""Ill Parole Negra"") come off weak. And Mercury's vocals here (again, save the studio track) sound overworked and, at times, (dare I say) half-assed. I am a longtime fan of Daniela and her band, but this one disappointed on first few listens. Who knows, though. Maybe it'll grow on me. (Stranger things have happened...)"
4,TOOK FOREVER,"The hat is very high quality BUT it took weeks to get it. There was no email notification of back order and when I emailed to find out when I could expect it, the response was a vague ""the item is on back order"" and no expected tme of arrival. Good thing I didn't need this for a gift. I would hesitate to order from the vendor again"
1,broke on the first use,"I purchased this on the strength of the Mr. Clean name. Big mistake. The handle and mop head parted ways on the first use and refused to be reunited! There was no direction on the packaging on what to do if this happened, the web site was useless, and the 800 number isn't manned on weekends (which is when I do most of my cleaning). After thirty minutes of trying to fit the handle back onto the mop head, I gave up. Everytime I fit it together, the top popped off again. This was a waste of money and time. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
3,The Gothic Snow White!,"Welcome to the wonderful world of fairy tales! This film takes us back to the dark origin of fairy tales.Sigourney Weaver is marvelous as the evil and creepy step-mother Claudia. She steals every scene and definantly paints the step-mother character in a truly dark veil.The actress who plays Lillians(Snow White) is wonderful and fabulous once she meets up with 'the dwarfs.'The setting is surreal and dark. A must-see for this dark interpretation of a classic fairy tale.You'll never read the words ""Once Upon a Time,"" quite the same again."
3,Sigourney is good,The rest of it was worth watchingBut as a rentalI passed it off on to some one else
3,Eeeuuuuu!,"With my husband away, and my sister visiting, I corralled three versions of the Snow White tale for a marathon. (Disney's not included). Why in heck did I BUY them!!!! This version was the most creative and dark, but I can't imagine ever watching it again."
4,WICKED version!! ROCK ON!!!!,A very 'true to tale' version of Snow White that will have you traumatized for days! Weaver plays a WICKED queen and should have been given an award for her performance. The acting was very good with all of the actors and the costumes were great! This movie should have been more popular than it was but it certainly has my vote as a new classic!!!
2,4:3 Letterboxed,"This 2012 DVD re-release is 4:3 Letterboxed.This means black bars on ALL four sides when viewed on your 16:9 television.I don't understand why companies are still doing this. Phooey!Also, the movie is pretty stinky as well... pass on it."
4,Wonderful & Dark,"Weaver is amazing in this version of the tale. This does not require a long review. The story is told the way it was intended to be without any ""Disney"" type foolishness. A masterpiece."
4,Darkness and depth,"This movie cuts deep if only you allow it... the raw and plastic love with Lilly's suitors, the pain and anguish of one losing that which they love so dearly, the betrayal...oh the betrayal...How could he after he loved so purely, take another?The vicious hate ridden jealousy...Sadly, the ill made, robotic moving baby... did they hit a two for one sale at Kmart?"
4,Pleasantly Entertained,"Hubby first rented this movie for us. I remember thinking what did they do to that cute little Disney movie? My bad :PI was entertained throughout the whole movie, being sucked in to the dark tone to the plot and visuals. The section of Lady Claudia and her baby freaked me out (few things freak me out - undead topics is one of them).Sigourney performs at her usual high level.Sam Neill is a nincompoop.Monica Keena plays a clueless girl very well."
2,wow..very disappointing...,shipping and DVD itself was great...the story and acting was not that great..didn't watch the whole thing..
1,are you kidding me ? so much for the hype.,"This movie couldn't hold our attention tonight. Painful to watch in so many ways. Gruesome, really dark take on snow white which looked interesting at first blush. If only there was something more than shock and bland dialogue! Just didn't do it for us. Given the positive reviews I guess we're in the minority."
4,Good,"Very interesting. APOCALYPSE NOW is one of my favorite movies. But I saw this with someone who never saw it, and even she found this movie interesting. I would have liked to have seen more of the Brando outtakes. And too bad they didn't get an interview with him. But one minor lesson of this film is to see some people spend years to get this movie off the ground. Then it took a couple years to film. And then Marlon Brando flies in, does his part in two weeks, flies out, and makes more money off the film than anyone else, save maybe Coppola himself. Where can I get a job like Brando's?"
5,GREAT. JUST GREAT,"Despite its reputation, I'd never gotten a chance to watch this feature until now. The best thing I found about it is that you are able to feel how everybody involved are this close to going completely over the edge. The level of madness in this documentary is truly amazing.Despite being aware of the final result which is APOCALYPSE NOW itself you'll feel the tension and unease about what will eventually happen and that I think is HEARTS OF DARKNESS triumph. It's a miracle a movie that good came out of this whole situation but for me, the film's weak link is the Brando part and after seeing the level of irresponsibility he showed during filming, it's far from surprising. To Coppola's credit, he made the best from what he had.I read a review of this DVD and came very close to not buying it due to the suppossed mediocrity of video and audio. All I can say is that it looks exactly the way it should."
1,Just awful on every level,"Poor Malcolm McDowell must have been really cash-poor when this offer came along. A tired, cheesy, poorly written, acted, directed, edited update of the Portrait of Dorian Gray. I actually had some hope for this at the begining as it tempted me with a campy begining that might have made it a fun companion piece with the Eyes of Laura Mars. - not to be unfortunately. Laughable in all the wrong ways."
2,Pact With The Devil doesnt pack a punch or a hit,"This movie is about a man named Louis, played by Ethan Erickson (The In Crowd, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), and he becomes a model, and his manager is the wilyeyed Henry, played by Malcolm McDowell. McDowell tells Louis about the story of Dorian Gray and how he made a pact with the devil. Louis or Dorian now writes in blood and he soon has eternal youth. This very interesting movie gets it fuel towards the middle but it can't help it. Very predictable. Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange, I:Spy) is wasted in my mind and why the hell is this movie introducing Ethan Erickson? He has been in a movie or two before this and a tv series..come on people get with it. Erickson is an ok actor and he does some ok acting in this. Unspeakably boring for a while, then it gets a shot of something and then it goes into a coma."
3,Good but Dated JVM Tutorial,"This book provides a good tutorial introduction to the Java Virtual Machine. It even includes an ""assembler"" so that you can practice writing Java bytecode yourself. Unfortunately, there are no exercises provided so that it takes a great deal of motivation and creativity to write JVM programs that will test your knowledge of the book's material.But by far the worst problem of this book is that it covers only the very first version of the JVM and the Java language. Now that there are new editions of the JVM spec and language spec, as well as the other JVM tutorial books, the time for updating this book is overdue."
4,Great book on the JVM.,A great book on the Java Virtual Machine! I learned moreabout how java really works faster than with any of the other fourjava books I own.--Dave Doolin
1,Wait for next edition,"Having been an Access business apps developer for the past two years, I'm now beginning a MS Office automation project gluing Access and Excel. I don't have, nor have I read this book, but I've looked at the sample pages and am familiar with other titles by the authors. It seems like I'll need the Cookbook now, but I'm writing this in February 2004 and the next edition will be available next month - I'll wait until then."
5,Lots of new material,"Another reviewer complained that this book includes material originally written for a book on Access 95. That's true, but the examples were updated to run on newer versions, and there's also a lot of great new material.Chapter 5, ""Taming Your Printer,"" was completely rewritten to take advantage of the new Access Printer object. Many of the topics in Chapter 11, ""The Windows API,"" were changed to account for changes in recent versions of Windows. Chapter 12, ""Automation,"" has new topics that show how to automate the newer versions of Office products. Plus, there are two completely new chapters--""Using Data Access Pages"" and ""Working with SQL Server Data.""So, even if you have a well-worn copy of the classic Access 95 How-To book on your shelf, as I do, you'll find lots of useful new material in this new Access Cookbook."
3,Access,Have not used it because I purchased it because my professor suggested that the whole class get it because it would come in handy when working on projects for his class.
2,"SAMUEL FULLER, OPUS 18","** 1969. Written and directed by Samuel Fuller. Sudan. Two treasure hunters hire Burt Reynolds to help them find a treasure lying at the bottom of the Red Sea. Completely reedited by its producers, SHARK! was disavowed by Samuel Fuller. If you really want to discover Fuller, one of the most underrated American directors, buyPickup on South Street - Criterion Collection,Forty GunsorThe Naked Kiss - Criterion Collectionwhich are true masterpieces.The Troma edition I've bought here presents an awful copy of the film, not much better than my old VHS, with interviews as bonus features. The different stakeholders, I understand them very well, prefer to talk about Samuel Fuller than to try to convince us that SHARK! is of some interest.A DVD zone completists only."
1,This is a joke...right?,"I bought four of these lights and am sending four of them back. In my humble opinion these are cheap china imports worth maybe a dollar a dozen, if that. Don't waste your time or money on these things. I think a match will give out more light."
2,3 year user,"I've been disappointed in (1) this product is light weight and blows off our deck when windy; (2) the light is not bright white as advertised: (3) replacement batteries, although new, don't always function properly and (4) the base on some of ours collect water. Because of these problems, I feel the product is overpriced. I originally purchased 6, then purchased an additional 6. I've also purchased 2 or 3 packs of batteries.I've thrown good money to a not so good cause....still hoping for better 'nights'. I'm on line at this time looking for this product at a lower price. If I find this or something similar for the price I want to pay I'll purchase again. PS. They are so cute!!"
3,Malibu Solar Candlle,"The item is much smalleer than I expected (mo dimensions were given). It works fine but does not really shed much light. It is decorative but not very useful otherwise.I received a set of Westinghouse solar lights t the same time, and these, though not any more powerful, are equally decorative and comparatively cheaper.I can give the Malibu solar candle only three stars."
5,so nice,"Item is larger than I thought, which was actually a good thing. Got this for my husband for our 10-year wedding anniversary. It's really nice."
2,OKAY,THE BOOK FAILS IN SHOWING TECHNIQUE. IT IS AN OKAY MASSAGE BOOK BUT NOT GREAT WITH ACCUPRESSURE. THERE ARE BETTER BOOKS AVAILABLE
3,On The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited,"This rating concerns the first edition of The birth of the Palestinian refugee problem, 1947-1949, for I have been informed by an equally well-read associate that, due to the author's radical political realignment following the outbreak of the second intifada, the current edition has been revised in order to bring its thesis in accordance with the author's newfound hardliner perspective. Given this contention, I ultimately intend to revisit the original work, in order to properly assess the current edition. Until then, let me just say that I found the original monograph to be well researched, convincing and, all in all, a must read for anyone intrigued by or otherwise invested in the tumultuous, dyadic history of Israel and Palestine. Interested parties would be well advised to seek out an older copy of the work in a large public or academic library."
5,"a year in a one room school house in rural Arizona, 1950's","Mrs. Bourne shows, in writing about a small one room schol house in rural southern Arizona, that the issues in education have not changed greatly. Lack of funding, quarrels over bi-lingual education, educating the whole child and not just a course of study have been with us. Her solutions give hope to those of us still teaching. Very motivating. A must-read for any pre-service teacher."
2,Not all it is cracked up to be...,"I have a 53"" Panasonic HD set which I bought 3 years ago and lost one of the component inputs... So rather than repair it I decided a switcher would be much more useful, especially at these price points. I found the standard definition channels to slightly degrade with the switcher in place. Edges were no longer sharp and somewhat fuzzy. In 1080i mode I was actually seeing a signal compatability issue. I have a Motorola DVR provided by Comcast supporting 1080i to my PT-53TW53G set. I would get purple and yellow lines whenever we went into 1080i mode. I am betting since my Panasonic set was made in 2003 that there now might exist some compatability issues with the most recent 1080i products and the JX-S111 did not account for this... This is just my un-expert opinion but I can tell you my experience wasn't the greatest... I packing this up to send back now."
3,The Omnibus and twentieth century secularism by Katie Hansen,"""The Celestial Omnibus"" by E.M. Forster tells of a boy's belief in a celestial omnibus, afuture state or heaven. In the story, his belief and curiosity is ridiculed by his parents.This action shows the idea of secularism, by discouraging the boy against the idea of anafter-life. Instead of leading him toward Christian morality, his parents direct him tomemorizing poetry, showing their belief in the morality and well being of man in this life.Sneakily, the boy discovers that the omnibus is not a joke, as his parents told him, but thatis was real. The boy is made to be a liar when he returns, but soon convinces Mr. Bons togo back to the omnibus with him. The boy is able to enter the ""heaven,"" but, because ofMr. Bons' disbelief, he dies on the earth"
2,Code page tables poorly organized,"I recognize that this book is really definitive on this topic. So I cannot help but assume that if I had the patience to figure out how to use it properly it would be worthwhile. BUT...Being somebody already reasonably familiar with using eastern languages on a computer, I have no desire to read the text in the book from the beginning. The majority of the book is code-page tables, which is an important reference. (They are actually of limited utility, since they are only indexed one way: code to character, with no reverse indexing. Understandable, since that would be very difficult, but still limiting.)But worst of all, the code page tables are laid out in a way that I do not understand. And I could not find an explanation of how these tables corresponded to byte-values in a data stream."
5,An exceptional book,"Many a showy coffee-table natural history book comes up short of the author's reputation and the price, but not this one. Having myself been privileged to spend some time hiking the cloud-forest trails at Monteverde, I can say that this exceptionally good book by a true authority is of surpassing virtue. The photographs are of flawlessly superior quality, and the writing is absolutely superb. Whether you ever witness a rainforest firsthand or not, you should read and learn from the beautiful synthesis that is this top-notch book."
1,Very disappointing,"These were so disappointing. They light for about 2 hours and that's that. I guess you get what you pay for. They were pretty cheap, I wasted a gift certificate on them. Lesson learned. I wouldn't buy these if I were you."
4,A Kind of Nick Drake in the Beginning of the Nintees !,"At that Time a real Gemm for Insiders. Acoustic Guitars , lightPercussion and a good Voice. Some of the Lyrics are realy great.It moves you away. His Album Paradise earn 5 Stars. The SongSecret Life, rises up with you and Love Full on is a real Charmer, but there are more charming good Songs on Pardise. On This CD Submarine are the Best Songs Embleme and Walk in the Wind, they carry you also slowly away. You can check his Voice on the Tribute Album of Leonhard Cohen`I'am your Fan, Varius Artists.The Song he arranged for this Tribute Album is not his Best, but will keep a little Impression of how his Album could be. It`s not so sexualistic as he choose for the Tributalbum.It`s not so sad , as Nick Drake, sometimes you must realy smileabout the Lyrics. He shoud be Great during his Lifetime, but asNick Drake , i suppose he will not. With enough Money, goodProducers he would make good Albums for the World, Iàm sure!!!!!"
2,A collection of articles that don't fit together.,"The book is a mess. About 16 authors put together a book with no structure or purpose. The reason such a large book contains so little information is that subjects are duplicated throughout the book. This one is a ""STAY AWAY""."
1,"Too much materials, not good anyway","I am an expert on FrontPage 98, and I am trying to learn Visual InterDev 6.0. I read this book 3-4 times while trying to follow the examples. I got lost! This book is no good for beginner !"
1,The Worst BOOk About InterDev,"I was cheated by author,this book is the worst book about interdev,It hasn't any example,only includes some introduction.Remember,Don't waste your money."
1,Save your money...,"This book tries to cover topics in a very abstract way. You do not get a feel for the components that make up a VI project. It barely touches on Design Time Controls. It just tells the user what these things are, I could have found that out by looking at the help files of VI. I need some pratical examples of how to use these components, which this book has miserably failed to provide. There is no source code availble on their web site either like they say. I went there and their web site kept giving me errors. In short, if you are looking for help on building useful sites buy another book."
2,Contents need more explanation and depth,"A lots of mumble-jumble materials which never really materialized for once. The instructions at times can be very frustrating with its example and procedures on showing you how to use InterDev. In the end, for me anyway, I find other books, even if they were not specificly written for Visual Interdev 6, offered more useful references and materials that actually kept me refering back to them from time to time."
3,"It's not good for nothing, it's good for something...","This book is like a User's guide that I'd expect to ship with VID, if MS still did that sort of thing. It's goal is admirable, but its content doesn't let it reach the goal. I would guess that most developers like me want to buy a book that's going to cut down the learning curve (without having to pay $1K for a class). But if you want to get anything out of the book, you have to do the work. The examples seem to skip steps and don't take into consideration what is and isn't installed on the client and/or server. I think it's a fair attempt at tackling a (somewhat) new product. For real newbies, this one may be it. If you've got experience with most MS dev. tools, you may want to check out some other books."
5,This is the flour I was looking for!,"There is not to much you can write about flour. But this is what I need to bake bakery type breads. I am baking my own sandwich(hoagie, submarine)rolls. And finally have duplicated pizza crust!Everyone thought I was crazy to buy such a large quantity. But I broke it down in to gallon sized zip lock bags. Each bag holds five pounds. I am storing the bags in my basement freezer, should keep forever."
2,uhhhhh,"when i first heard this album it was garbage,now im in to hip hop like krs-one tribe called quest kweli,but this album is completely lacking tight lyrics or beats please dont buy this album unless you are collecting lol"
1,Poor Technical Reference,"This book didn't give much more information than the ""Exchange 2000 Reviewers Guide"" whitepaper from Microsoft. The layout was so poor that you have to jump around the book to put ""the puzzle together"". The auther did a good job at rehashing all of the Microsoft marketing materials, however. It was a book that told what Exchange could do, what each feature could do, but it wasn't very good at explaining HOW to configure them.Avoid this book if you need a good technical reference, your better off logging on to Microsoft Technet for the info, or spend your money on a different technical reference book."
2,Not worth the money.,This book does not contain real tech information pertaining to real word situations. This book might a little helpful if your migrating from exchange 5.5. Other than that it is to non-technical.
2,Only good as a deployment guide,"You will find much more info just reading the online help files. Which is what I didn't want to do, and had to anyway! Well over half the book covered deployment and planning. I wanted administration and much more in-depth coverage of Lotus Notes connection and Outlook Web Access. I only gave this book 2 stars because it did answer a couple questions, but if I purchase a book and have to get most answers in help files, I don't like it. I partly am to blame for not liking it though. When I got it, there were only two other books available. I see several others now, and will have to spend more I guess."
1,Not enough detail,"Given the size of the book (>600 pages), I expected more technical detail. There is far too much filler material and not enough in depth information on Exchange 2000. More information and details are required in the key subject areas. The author also tends to jump around between different subjects within the same chapter. Overall, possibly one of the worst technical books I have purchased lately."
2,Technically Inaccurate,"I bought this book because I am working on a software project that involves Exchange 2000. However, the book's author does not use proper terminology. For example, they talk about SAM replication times but Exchange 2000 uses Active Directory. They talk about site connectors but Exchange 2000 uses Routing Group Connectors. I know this product is still in Beta, but RC2 is feature complete. This book could have been better. Only buy this if you absolutely need to implement Exchange 2000 ASAP. If you read Microsoft's documentation first, you can weed through this book for more details."
4,Another excellent guide to living in a foreign country,"Previous to my move to Spain I bought David Hampshire's ""Living and Working in Spain"" and found it to be an invaluable aid and an excellent source of information. I'm contemplating a move to the US and so was very pleased and interested to see that David Hampshire has published a similar book for America. I wasn't disappointed with the book and again found it packed with useful information, and important time and money saving tips. this edition looks as if it too will prove invaluable to me as I find my way around America and the Americans. At least with ""Living and Working in America"" I've had all my questions answered so far and I feel I'm as prepared as I ever will be!"
3,This Darkness Got To Give.,"Max Ludington can write. The book is filled with quick and vivid descriptions. He also can handle a back and forth plotline. The story? Meh. A preppie deadhead quits school, hits succesive GD tours, meets women, loses friends, gets smack habit. While grounded in a darker reality the book still has a rather cliched approach to plot.Perhaps I expected a more comical and swirling psychedelic narrative and was disappointed by the typical marijuana leads to heroin line.Still I look forward to more from this writer."
5,A MUST HAVE,"If you are a Shania Twain fan, then this video is a must. Not only will you enjoy her voice, but you will also get to enjoy her beauty as she sings some of her top hits. It's almost as good as being at one of her concerts!"
5,Unbelievably Gorgeous Tasteful Video,"Shania Twain is very beautiful, the music is tremendous and the video presentation is extremely well done. Don't miss it.1. Whose bed have your boots been under2. Any man of mine3. The woman in me4. I'm outta here5. You win my love6. No one needs to know7. Home ain't where his heart is8. God bless the childRunning time is 35 minutes."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL SHANIA FANS!!!!!!!,"I love music videos...I have always loved watching them on MTV, and this video is just what the doctor ordered. It has all of Shania's breakthrough music videos. I received and watched it yesterday and will keep watching it over and over and over again."
4,Ripping it up,"For those who only know Sir Elton by his carefully crafted studio albums this just might be a surprise. Way back in 1970 this kid and his krackerjack bandmates could really rock the room and, fortunately, this recording is proof. The 3 man group is tight and bursting with energy throughout the concert and Elton's youthful enthusiasm bursts out through his spirited vocals. While it's not a cd I listen to often it's still a pleasure to rediscover this great talent's roots when I put it on."
4,Where it started,"Before hearing this album, he was just 'the guy who had a hit with Your Song'. This LP made me a big fan. Unfortunately the shift from truly interesting artist to slef absorbed pop king happened too quickly. These early LPs like 11-17-70 are wonderful reminders of a great era and hints of what might have been if the lure of glam pop hadn't been so seductive."
4,the remaster might be TOO remastered,"Let me preface this by saying that this is one of the best live albums ever, and one of Elton's best works. Looking at it, you think, ""Only 6 songs?!"" This is FANTASTIC stuff and some of his best piano playing. HOWEVER!!! the remaster sounds odd to me. Wierd echoes (Get back! back back, Get back! back back, Get back to where you once belonged....) permeate the thing. I don't know. It doesn't sound right like the non-remaster did. They fooled with it too much. The liner notes are nice. Amoreena is a WONDERFUL song, but he messes up they lyrics, which is why I'm sure they left it off the album. So why put it back on? I'm sure Elton winces when he hears it. Answer: bonus track. THIS IS A MUST HAVE, but TRY to get the pre-remastered version and borrow your friend's copy of the liner notes... If you like Elton, visit my band's webpage at members.aol.com/ulrocks/ Terry Roberts"
2,Save your money,This live album was only mediocre. Buy the studio versions. Some of the tunes on this go on and on until you have to move onto the next track.
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Elton live is rarely a good thing. This CD is no exception and if it weren't for his better than average version of ""Take Me To the Pilot"" this wouldn't even get 2 stars."
3,Absolutely Disapointing,"This remaster is a complete failure. What was originally a clear and powerful recording has been reduced to a dull and muted remnant by time and poorly applied technology. If this is the best they could do, they should never have released it... a real remaster disaster. If you have ever owned the original recording, forget about this one. It will only disapoint you."
3,Early Elton Rockin' in New York,"One of 4(!) albums that Elton released in 1971, this 1970 concert recording from WNEW-FM in New York has a early Elton performance, with all of the rock/piano-blues (Take Me to the Pilot, the Stones' Honky Tonk Women) that was a trademark of his earlier albums. Not a classic, but a good example of his early concerts, before his popularity was about to explode into superstardom."
5,Funding your million dollar idea,"I am in the process of starting my own company and found the advice here simply excellent. I bought this video after reading Alicia Castillo Holley's other books and after hearing her speak at a conference some years ago. There is no doubt about it, in the field of entrepreneurship and funding, Alicia Castillo Holley is the best."
3,Minor Spoilers,"I remember this movie well-- Linn Yann was an intelligent girl who had had far too much discipline in her early life. and when she won the regional spelling bee everyone in the movie seemed so surprised. IMHO, wouldn't her background actually make her MORE likely to succeed in events like this, rather than less likely? (not to mention that kids tend to pick up new languages very quickly to begin with)"
1,Awful,"The description of these from the manufacturer describes them as delicious... sorry, but I must disagree.I will not be purchasing these again.I had high hopes as I very much recommend the protein shakes.Horrible flavor, consistency, and aftertaste.Great concept, but horrible execution, in my opinion."
2,Why to buy?,"Why buy this version of the Episode I screenplay? Far from a facsimile, this is an edited version of the shooting script, modified to fit the action exactly. I DON'T recommend it. If you want a copy of the script, I recommend the Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace Illustrated Screenplay, which has storyboards of all the action and is the original shooting script, with scenes not appearing in the finished version. Only buy this if you want a version that fits the movie exactly."
2,Sloppy rehash of lots of great but often unfounded gossip,"Like the story of Sawney Beane, the more outre exploits of Dashwood and his Franciscan Friars will be repeated as fact as long ass there are people more interested in sensational stories than truth. Much of it had its origin in politically motivated slander by former associate John Wilkes, another fascinating character. Mannix's book is an enjoyable read, but don't take it too seriously since, as with most who have written about Dashwood's ""Hell Fie Club,"" he didn't want any real research (and possible attendant debunking) to get in the way of any good stories. This is even more enjoyable if read in tandem with a good biography of Dashwood so that you can sort out the BS for yourself."
5,Lovely comfort of spoken word,"I haven't really used self-hypnosis tapes before but when I got the opportunity to try Elena's tapes, I was curious and interested. My family had gone through quite an ordeal with several deaths in our family in a short amount of time so I was anxious to try and ""heal"" myself and maybe some family members.Elena's tapes are wonderful. She takes you through a meditative journey by talking you through it and I felt relaxed and comfortable. I loaned this to my mom who really enjoyed it. She became so relaxed and wanted to know more about her tapes.I recommend Elena's tape to people who are trying to heal from a life experience that was not necessarily pleasant and who are trying to cope with life."
5,I Love Graham,"This is the only tape of Graham Norton available in the U.S. If there is another, please let me know.This is a compilation of hilarious clips. Celebrities participate in Graham brand of practicle jokes, audience members divulges outrageous incidents from their own lives, and Graham's great sense of humor are a treat.I wish there were more Graham in the U.S."
5,FUNNIEST DVD EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"if i could ever survive on ONE DVD for the rest of my life, it would have to be this one!Graham Norton tells it like it is, and gets his celebrity guests to do the same!YOU MUST BUY!"
4,Funny show,"If you like Graham Norton, you'll enjoy some of the highlights on this DVD. His normal shows are better, but this was fun to watch."
3,Please release all 10 Seasons!,"I would love to have all 10 seasons, at least available for download unedited. This best of is great but it's from 2004,.... he's still on in 2012. We need more More MORE!"
3,Mixed,"Everything was good. However would like to suggest that you include the DVD Region ( e.g 1- US , 4 - Aust ) in DVD Description / Comments.. as this DVD would not play in Australia."
2,Nothing but cheap and vulgar humor,Norton is basically a witless person but he raises giggles among the immature with his display of sex toys and x-rated internet sites on the BBC. That is his whole act. Adolescent Howard Stern type of humor.
5,Ausome season,I didn't even know that the seventh season was out until not to long ago. THis season is so great. I thought the sixth season was the best but this is way better.
1,South Park: The Down Years,"Definitely rated five stars if your under the age of ten. Adults beware. These guys have run out of ideas since the first season and are proceeding on the fumes from their fart jokes.I hope Trey and Parker make vast amounts of money to help pay for voice impersonation lessons.Besides the smugness, I am tired of all the voices in South Park sounding all too similar."
3,"south park rocks, but not the sound quality","the seventh season of south park is just as fantastic as seasons 1 through 6. this dvd, however, has exceptionally poor sound quality. I'd wait with buying it until this has been corrected by the company, as at times, it is almost impossible to make out what's happening sound-wise - and half the fun of south park is in the sound!"
5,"""My name is Jennifer Lopez and I like tacos y burritos""","This season hosts the episode ""Fatt Butt and Pancake Head"", which is by far one of, or possibly the best episode of ""South Park"" ever!This satirical spoof of Jennifer Lopez is proof that intelligent and rude comedy like ""Monthy Python"" still is possible and existant. I love it! If only all television can be this adventurous and daring, we'd all have alot more to entertain us. Why the makers of South Park targeted Jenny is unknown to me, but still serves as great entertainment and satire.I can't wait for the DVD and see the J.lo episode again...it's worth buying the whole box set for this one episodeQ"
3,The Last Good Season of South Park,"Afther this season south park went down hill, there were a couple episodes in season eight but other then that south park changed a lot.....for the worst....and I'am a huge south park fan."
5,The evolution of south park,"From ripping on reality tv to exposing mormon religion for the bs fraud that it is to tearing down the christian rock music industry , season 7 of south park was intensely funny. At the beginning of season 7, we were all bickering over the whole Invasion of Iraq. It was a very touchy issue that this episode addressed nicely. The social dichotomies this show offers up in its latter years are as refreshing it gets. And who can't get enough of Butters? From him reminding Stan that it's better to be a sissy whiner than a faggy goth, to rubbing salt in Cartman's wounds after Token beat the snot out of him, Butters evolution as a character was great. Makes one wonder why they ever bothered trying to make Pip the kid everyone ripped on. Anyway, I loved season 7 immensely. especially the end of 'raisins' when Stan addresses his feelings for Wendy and her decision to date Token; 'Hey wendy? You're a bitch! And Token? Right here, buddy!!' as he flips them the bird. Classic."
5,South Park Funnier each year,"I have always loved South Park but feel that as it started taking on more touchier subjects it became funnier. Cartman changing the words of popular music my inserting ""Jesus"" and then going plantinum... I love the way South Park makes us laugh at everything from Special Olympics, the news media, to ourselves. I will continue to buy the DVD's as I can't help but laugh no matter how many times I might have viewed them."
4,South park,"If you like ""The Newer"" south park than you will love this season. But if you're like me and like the older episodes. Than pass on season 7. I'll admit some of the newer episodes are really good but i still haven't seen them all yet. I'd probably say that the best episode on this season is Bebe's Boobs destroy soicety."
1,Anyone else have audio issues?,"South Park is my all-time favorite show, and hence I own every season. I just picked up season seven and was disappointed with the audio. It seems to get really low in places, and really high in others. Like it wasn't properly mastered or something.I'm not an audio freak or anything and it takes a lot for me to ever complain about something, but I spent fourty bucks on this season and kind of expected the sound to at least be somewhat level."
5,the best season on dvd yet,"Do yourself a favor and get this set if you're a south park fan.Even if you're not a fan you have to like ""fat butt and pancakehead"" which makes fun of Ben Affleck and J Lo.""Toilet Paper"" which parodies both ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Godfather 2"" in a brilliant plot. Other highlights are ""Butt Out"" showing the effect of stop smoking propaganda and ""Red Mans Greed"" tackles SARS and Native American policy."
2,Good for Oracle DBA's ; a lot of SAP related errors,"Good book from an Oracle DBA perspective, however it contains a lot of errors, like page 9: ""ORACLE_SID always begins with an uppercase 'SA' (....) "" Also the description about tablespaces is confusing. The chapter on large database is flatly insufficient. Just a copy of the standard documentation. The subject on performance and reorganisations is quiet handy and usefull."
4,Not your typical audio rack,"Most audio stands are relatively flimsy and not that great looking when you get up close. Not so with the Sanus media rack. The stand comes in three beautiful finishes that integrate perfectly with the rest of the Natural Furniture line.It's hard to tell from a single picture, but the stand is actually two sided and sits on a swivel base. The shelves are only as deep as a DVD (or so), so there is no wasted space behind your collection.The shelves themselves are glass and can be spaced in a variety of ways. I found I didn't even use all of the shelves included."
1,I Can't Hear A Word She's Saying,"I heard this song on the radio at work and my co-workers and I were like, ""What in the world is she singing about?"" I don't understand a darn thing Janet is saying in this song because all I hear is a bunch of murmuring. Janet was never much of a singer anyway, but at least her vocals were clearer and stronger back in the day. I don't know, maybe age is having an affect on her vocals. Anyway, the melody to this song is nice, but that's it. Janet's and Nelly's vocals both ruined the song big time. ""Call On Me"" is weak and will be forgotten like yesterday."
1,Horrible Song,Nelly is doing more singing than Janet Jackson is on this clunker that alone spells trouble. dime a dozen track with no feeling or meaning. this is a ok B-side but not worthy of a lead off single&especially not worthy to remember the Control project from 20 years back. but Janet Jackson has been played out for well over a Decade to me&this song only adds to that point.
5,Tension Action Everything!,"Elvis Cole is taking care of 10 year old Ben Chenier while Ben's mother, Lucy, is out of town. Lucy and Elvis have been together for awhile and now Elvis is getting closer to Ben. Suddenly Ben is kidnapped from Elvis' home. There seems to be a connection between Elvis' Vietnam War years and the motive for the kidnapping. The flashbacks to Cole's experiences in Vietnam are absolutely riveting...a little reminiscent of Black Hawk Down, but even better. Joe Pike is back after suffering significant injuries eight months earlier. He is still not 100%. Will he be able to help Cole save Ben? The ending is tension filled with non-stop action (took me half an hour after I finished the book to get my neck muscles to relax). An excellent addition to the Elvis Cole series."
5,This book delivers!,"Elvis and Joe are back. Elvis has his girlfriend's 10 year old son as a house guest until she returns from a trip, when Ben is kidnapped right off Elvis'back deck. The plot thickens from there and you are in for one hell of a ride.Carol Starkey returns from Demolition Angel; she hasnt softened a bit. She and Elvis bond; Joe Pike is back from an Alaskan trip where a grizzly almost gets our Joe!The last few chapters of this book are worth the price of admission and nail biting. Robert Crais remains 'the man'! Excellent book - try to put it down!"
2,:(,"After Demolition Angel, I have tried to love subsequent books by Mr. Crais, but none - for me - have come anywhere close to meeting the standards set in the first Starkey book. I picked up The Last Detective because of Starkey's role in it, but I simply couldn't get into the book. I've tried twice, and I swear I'm going to try again. But the book just failed to pull me in."
3,Why has no one commented on the huge oversight?,"Did anyone else find it weird that Cole says in the beginning of Chapter 6 that he had never met Richard before, when Richard and one of his henchmen tossed Elvis' office in Indigo Slam and threatened Cole to stay away from Lucy and Ben? The entire time I read the book I couldn't get past that. Seems to me a big detail to overlook. Not much new to add to the series. Maybe Crais should take a page out of George Pelecanos' book and start a new series with another set of characters..."
1,Not exactly a page turner,"I bought this book by relying on the first fourcustomer reviews, all five stars. This was a sillytale without any strong characters. Having justfinished ""The Vanishing Man"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"",I can't give this book more than one star. Whoeverwrote about tension and suspense, I could not findany of them. The book was too predictable, and Elvislacks the smarts to be a half decent P.I."
1,The LAst Detective Audio Book,"I love the Elvis Cole Series by Robert Crais. I am not reviewing the author or the book, but my purchase. My CD was incomplete. It covered the first chapter, 31 minutes. The rest of the audio was deleted, or just wasn't there. I was very disappointed.The Last Detective (Elvis Cole) [Abridged][Audiobook] (Audio CD)Alvin"
2,Elvis Cole lite,"I love all the Elvis Cole novels - apart from this one. Very disappointed - very few witty one liners, Joe Pike not really doing much, the bird from Demolition Angel popping up, Elvis's unhappy childhood. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Skimmed through it in no time at all, didn't chuckle once. Boring and generic are the words that spring to mind. Will I read another one? - probably, but won't fork out top dollar for the large format paperback."
2,Great if you like really predictable mystery/thrillers,"The latest installment in author Robert Crais' series featuring private detective Elvis Cole has it all: likeable good guys coping with current crises and echoes of the past, really mean bad guys, fast-moving narration, snappy dialogue, and real detective work. Unfortunately, it was obvious very early on ""whodunit"" with only the most token efforts at misdirection - too bad, because I really wanted to like this book."
5,Cole and Pike are Back!!!!,The last two Elvis Coles had been almost boring because of the taming effect his new relationship had on him. But this one brought him back with a vengeance . . . with Pike struggling to come back from serious injuries from the last outing. This gave the excellent character Joe Pike a lot more depth. Thoroughly enjoyable.
3,Solid 3 stars,"My first Crais novel. If you are a fan of this genre then it is a good read. Not the best ever, but certainly entertaining enough that you'll want to finish the novel off. I would read from this author again in the future."
3,Suspenseful,"Elvis Cole is once again coming to terms with his life as a private eye in the streets of Los Angeles. He loves his girlfriend Lucy Chenier, but their relationship is stretched to the limit when Cole's job brings danger very close her beloved son Ben. When Ben is snatched from Cole's secluded home, the demons from Elvis's past catch up with him. The kidnappers want retribution for an incident that happened twenty years ago in Vietnam. Now Elvis must embark on a journey into his past to protect his future..."
5,Tension Action Everything!,"Elvis Cole is taking care of 10 year old Ben Chenier while Ben's mother, Lucy, is out of town. Lucy and Elvis have been together for awhile and now Elvis is getting closer to Ben. Suddenly Ben is kidnapped from Elvis' home. There seems to be a connection between Elvis' Vietnam War years and the motive for the kidnapping. The flashbacks to Cole's experiences in Vietnam are absolutely riveting...a little reminiscent of Black Hawk Down, but even better. Joe Pike is back after suffering significant injuries eight months earlier. He is still not 100%. Will he be able to help Cole save Ben? The ending is tension filled with non-stop action (took me half an hour after I finished the book to get my neck muscles to relax!). An excellent addition to the Elvis Cole series."
3,Depressing and Overhyped,"After rattling off 7 humorous books, Robert Crais obviously got tired of writing snappy one-liners and witty slapstick and decided to get more serious with the Elvis Cole series. LA Requiem proved that he was heading in a new direction and the somber tone gets even darker with The Last Detective. The only problem is, the book is so damn somber that readers will be grabbing for the whisky bottle or the handgun (for suicide purposes) so often during this book that it's difficult to call this novel ""enjoyable.""Robert Crais writing a serious book is somewhat like Jim Carrey trying to do a serious movie. In some ways it works and in some ways it doesn't. Crais is competent enough to pull it off to a certain extent, but fans of the witty Elvis Cole will find little to smile about during this story of kidnapping, Vietnam flashbacks, war crimes, family neglect and personal anguish. If you want a fun read, avoid this book."
3,A Bitter Disappointment,"As an Elvis Cole and Robert Crais fan, I waited with great anticipation to read the ""The Last Detective"". What a bitter disappointment! A predictable plot, I had the villain identified by Chapter 3 and knew immediately the Elvis/Luce relationship was history. Where was the wise-cracking, free-spirt, hilarious Elvis Cole? Looking forward to his return in the next book in the series."
3,Disappointing!,"Being an avid Robert Crais fan, especially a fan of the Cole/Pike series, I found this book to be a big disappointment. This is the Cole/Pike series, not the Cole/Pike series with a foul mouthed female Carol Starkey thrown in for good measure. After waiting several years for the series to pick up where it left off after L.A. Requiem I expected more from the book then what it offered. Joe Pike should have received more focus in the book."
3,"Not one of Crais' best, but totally worth it!","Elvis' girlfriend's son, Ben, gets kidnapped from the back of Elvis' house. The kidnapper calls and says it's because of Elvis' actions in Vietnam that the boy was taken. Elvis and Pike team-up again to find out who took Ben and get him back alive. Elvis is not his usual wise-cracking self, instead he's determined to do whatever it takes to get Ben back. The reader finds out more about Elvis' background in this outing, especially his military experiences in Vietnam. We also meet Carol Starkley, who readily agrees to help Elvis. Crais really ratchets up the intensity in this one. Even though the plot is a bit too predictable, the gunfight, at the end, is totally worth it!"
3,Not worth the wait,"Compared to the other books in the Elvis Cole series, this was not as suspenseful. Maybe Crais was wanting to show a different side of Cole and Joe Pike, but I had got used to their personalities and complementary natures.This was not a book to put down, however, and with the ending, I expect Crais has given us a cliff hanger to the next in the series.Recommend to buy, but wait till paperback."
5,Good Writing,"I have just started reading the works of this author, and he is quite good. If you like James Patterson and that type of book, then this might be for you. You can get some of the older books for as little as $4.00 including postage, so there is not much to lose. Enjoy."
5,Read it in a morning.....,"Read it in a morning.....and lots I was supposed to do, too. I may have to seek a higher power.....Now, we have to wait another year for the next one....."
2,Disappointing,"I LOVE Robert Crais and Elvis and especially Joe, but this one was so much like some of the others, I kept thinking ""have I already read this book?"" Same old, same old. Crais needs to get away from bad guys stalking Elvis' girlfriend and her son in so many books, and get back to what he used to do so well...detective stories with strange characters that highlight Elvis' intelligence and Joe Pike coming to the rescue."
1,Fake shoes,The shoes are not genuine and are made of cheaper material. The toe of the shoe is separating after only wearing them twice
1,Shoe Defecto,"Hello, I have purchased sperry billfish 3 eye shoes for the last ten years. I have not had a problem until my recent purchase at Peltz shoes. The shoes I received were defective beyond belief. I did get a refund with the help of Amazon.com"
1,Planet Shoes is the worst company ever do not ever buy a shoe from them,The shoe is ok minus the fact that it started to fall apart after just several uses. Then planet shoes actually had the guts to tell me that it was from normal wear in tear. For a product that is supposedly high quality I would recommend just buying the shoes from the sperrys website that way you don't have to deal with stupid companies that have terrible customer service. Worst customer service ever.
4,Great shoe,"Sperry Top-Sider Men's Nautical Billfish 3-Eye Boat Shoe, The third pair in about 12 yrs. I wear the heck out of them and they wear great and are confortable. Highly recommend them"
1,They have wrong picture.,"They have a wrong picture. If you click the shoes that looks like beige, in description, it says tan/beige.And now it looks like I have to charge for refund."
5,Men's Sperry Billfish Tan/Beige Shoes,My oldest grandson picked these out so I ordered for one of his Xmas gifts. They arrived and look exactly as he wanted.You can't beat the price!!! Another gift crossed off.
2,Topsider quality,The top-siders I received had frayed laces. The inside was not as soft and smooth as the last pair I purchased.
3,love the shoes but hate the inner sole,"I absolutely love the shoes, however i always wear them without socks. It takes about 2 months and the inner sole starts to loosen and wrinkle under my feet. I have had three pair and they all do the same thing. Sure wish Sperry could resolve this problem. I usually buy an inner sole from Heb or Walmart to help with the problem somewhat."
4,Good product/a little expensive,"I orderd these shoes for my stepson and he really likes them, they are made good and look good on. On the other hand I think they cost to much on this site. After I ordered them I noticed them in some local shoe stores for about $20.00 cheaper. All in all we are pleased with the product."
4,Sperry's,"Good shoe. Showed up in not really new condition even though they were still in the box. There were scuff marks on the leather. Anyways, not a big deal for boat shoes, good product, good company to buy from, cheap price. I am satisfied."
5,Sperry Top-Sider,These Sperry Top-Siders are great! Sperry is a classic name and style in boat shoes. These are no exception. These shoes are incredibly comfortable. The light brown and beige colorway are perfect for summer.
1,The wrong color came again,"The picture shows a tan shoe. I have ordered this a second time and the two tone shoe arrives. It also arrived as a gift, but no way to ship it back. I see the color says tan/beige, but the color on the picture is only one color, beige.I need to return this item and would appreciate help in that process, as well as finding the correct Sperry.THank you so much,Sharon Ellis"
5,Comfort and Style,"I have been using these with many outfits lately and they are very comfy and easy to slip on. They give a dressy look to any oufit. I only dislike that they can get dirty easily, but if your not out in the yard alot with these then they are perfect.I would recommend to all!"
4,Good shoes!,"I bought a pair of these shoes. Honestly, I'm not yet sure how I feel about them. They are definitely starting to grow on me, though. When you first wear them, they take some breaking in and are pretty painful on the feet. Otherwise, I would totally recommend these!!!"
4,"Look nice, but not very comfortable","I really like these shoes, but either they just don't fit my foot correctly, or I just don't care for their lack of comfort. I bought my girlfriend a pair of women's, and she thinks they're extremely comfortable, so I may have to look into getting a wider size. My feet usually fit in regular shoes and wides seem to be a bit loose, but these shoes must run a little narrow, so if you're in the same boat-get a wider size"
2,the stitching came apart in the left shoe tongue.,"poor craftship when it came to the stitching. they look an feel good but, they started coming apart an I only wore them slightly."
3,"Good, but not great, baseball book","I love baseball, and I am very sentimental about the roll baseball has played in my close relationship with my father. For this reason, I was excited about this book.While the book was generally well-written and, at times, the story-telling was captivating, I expected more. The attempt to intertwine the game and the life story didn't always work for me. I was also shocked by the obvious factual errors. There was a page devoted to Vin Scully and his famous ""I don't believe what I just saw"" call of Kirk Gibson's classic home run. Of course, it was the late Jack Buck--not Vin Scully--who made this famous call. As a lifelong Jack Buck fan, I was upset by this factual mistake.Overall, this is a quick and enjoyable read. I recommend it for baseball fans who enjoy good literature. It isn't for everyone."
4,this cd is out of control...,"rarely am i significantly impressed by cd's that i buy after only hearing one song. somewhere down the line a friend of mine had put me on to hearing 'banana rejection'. on the first listen i was surprised by the range of sound the previously unknown band (to me) was putting into such a concise work of music. but i was hooked, and i bought the full disc today. all i can say is, they will never be what you anticipate them to be. they were more hardcore, and more heavy, and more placid, and more touching, than i could have hoped they would be. great mixing, great music - always different, and always reaching. it's the way expression should be. there are so few bands that really genre push these days, but i think silent drive have got it just right. all i could have hoped for is another song or two for length. but quality over quantity, no?"
3,FLIGHTS OF FANCY,"With a sly nod to W.B. Yeats' ""The Peacock"" from ""Responsibilities and Other Poems,"" this new collection of 26 brief poems by the late American poet Valerie Worth, beautifully follows in the footprints of her admired ""Small Poems"" books. She obviously delighted in the process of crafting free verse about common objects from umbrellas and clouds to a delicious ode to ice cream. Her inviting, melodious rhythm is deceptively simple. For sophisticated readers, her spare, zen-like words will evoke the senses with meditative thoughts. For young readers, they paint mysterious pictures that gently stir the imagination and coax to sleep."
5,Perfect,"This multitool and mini maglite are both very useful. Specially I very much liked the ""Candle"" property of the maglite. I live in a country that we time to time have power interruptions. And it came very handy when it happened to be when we were sitting a bar. And the multi tool from Gerber is something that I'd sleep with it. I am generally at the site. And you never know when you'll need it. Thanks to Gerber and Maglite very much for their very quality products."
3,Director 5 is very different!,"Neither the reviews nor bumpf mention is that this book concentrates on Director 5. There are fundamental differences between 5 and 6. The Score has been changed (for the better), and this book makes no mention of behaviours, forcing you to write script.With Macromedia now on version 7 my advice would be don't buy this edition."
5,Mind Bomb was ahead of it's time,I am from chicago and have had the pleasure of seeing them live twice. I will tell you that they can Rock. I highly recommend this album!!! Like others after 15 years I still jam this album out.
3,This could have only happened in the sixties,"This record has some fantastic moments, including the (German) hit single ""My Friend Jack"", ""Have Some More Tea"", and ""You Can't Catch Me"". That said, you shouldn't buy this record unless you have more than a passing interest in garage and psychedelic music. The lyrics are a GOOF ""My friend Jack eats sugarlumps. . ."", the music is dated, but it definitely has its merits. EXCELLENT liner notes, including a great Chris Blackwell story!"
1,"Strike 3, Your out!","Letters From Rifka by Karen Hesse is a book about a 12 year old girl, Rifka's journey from Russia to Ellis Island in New York. This book is writtin in a series of letters to Rifka's cousin Tovah. Even though it has historical information and gives you information about immigrants trip to America, it isn't a book i would reccomend. It has no funny parts in it and unless you are serious about finding information you probably won't be interested in this book."
1,Letters to rifka,rifka was a girl that was trying to get to America. But the guards were on a look out for her because she was Jewish.
5,One of the best books I ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I loved this book soooooo much!!!!!!I recomend it to everyone.I felt like I was really there with her on her vogage to america.Will she make it?????
5,A wonderful 5-star book about life during the Holocaust.,"I think that this book about the life of Rifka is one for everyone. It gives a her point of view with a lot of details.When Rifka and her family try to come to America, only a few problems stand in their way. What will happen next? READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!"
5,It's so exiting & you never know what will happen.,"This is one of my favorite books. One of the reasons that I like it so much is because you can acually imagine yourself as Rifka. You can feel the way that she does and you just want to read on and on and on. This book tells you about how the Russians treated the Jews. This book is so exciting clear until the end. It doesn't all of a sudden stop either, like some other books I've read.I would definitely reccommend this book to anyone."
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER,IF YOU WANT A BOOK TO READ READ THIS ONE I PERSONALLY LOVED IT I SPENT ALL MY FREE TIME READING IT AND WITHIN 3 DAYS I FINISHED IT. JUST SIT DOWN AND ENJOY TRUTST ME I LOVED IT. SO CHECK IT OUT AT YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY
5,Read In one night.....I did,Rifka's travels and journeys will make your mouth water when you hear of her times. If you love history of Jews leaving their country for America then you will love this book.
4,Brave Rifka,"Letters from Rifka is a wonderful book and one of the best I've read all year. I love how it tells the story of her immigrating to America through letters. Rifka is a young, brave, jewish girl escaping from Russia trying to get to America with her family putting aside hardships as she captures herself in writing."
5,"This book is neat,but it is sad.","This book will make you want to read it agian,and agian.Rifka,the main charictor,has a sad,but exiting adventure that will take you back to WW1. My faverite part is when a boy named Phieter kissed her,but he died in a storm."
4,Letters From Rifka,"Letters From RifkaThe title of the book I read was Letters From Rifka by Karen Hesse. The setting takes place in Russia. This book is about a young girl named Rifka who overcomes many obstacles trying to flee Russia to get to America. Perhaps the greatest obstacle she faces is being left behind by her family and falling ill with deadly typhus.Because they were Jewish their government treated them bad in Russia, so they had to escaped Russia, and they decided to go to America. On Rifka's way she passed through a lot of sad things. But on her way the doctor who examined her told her she couldn't go to America because she had a disease. Will Rifka ever make it to America and see her family again?I really enjoyed this book because it taught me new things about how people lived during the wars, and I recommend this book for all people who enjoy Historical Fiction.Jose.H"
4,Mixed Bag,"When listening to this you have to wonder if XTC was not under some pressure to conform to the music industry they lashed out against on Mummer's ""Funk-Pop-A-Roll"". When my friends would hear ""This World Over"" they would say ""Is that the Police""? Also songs like ""Reign Of Blows"" and ""Train Running Low On Soul Coal"" are among the hardest rocking tracks ever to be released by XTC. Coming off the pastoral ""Mummer"" this was quite a surprise. The release is a lot like a train for the most part, Big, Loud, and Noisy. The irony is that although is is big, bold, and brash, it still was not in step with increasingly pop flavored keyboard driven New-Wave music of the moment. If this was a last chance effort for a stab at rock stardom it is a pretty decent one. Still for a band that had accomplished as much as XTC, and was about to accomplish even more (""Skylarking"" and ""Oranges and Lemons"") this one is not quite up to par with their best."
2,ccar3,The book came fine and was the right book but the binding was broken and all the pages were falling out.
1,Very Unhappy,"I made my purchase on 12/30/11. After a few days it still showed as ""waiting to ship"". I sent several emails requesting a shipment date with no response. I finally gave up and attempted to cancel my order on 1/9/12 and ordered from another company. That same day my purchase showed up at my door even though my status was still not shipped. Now I have to try and cancel my order from the other company. I don't recommend buying from this company."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,The book was in an absolute awesome condition. It was obviously used but corners were not too banged up and it was still really solidly bound. I definitely got my money's worth.
1,OOOOOh not again,My dog ate the hole thing the second we gave it to her and shes still a teething puppy.now thats sad.!!!!!!
5,Skip and Wacko make it worthwhile,"Standout tracks: NOLIA CLAP(original and remix), WHATS UP(original and remix), DONT START, WHO THE F**k IS THIS, JUVIE WACKO AND SKIP, SOULJA, WAR S***, AT U BITCHES, THE BEST YEARS and RIDE TONIGHT. Filler: Whats your brains like is a wack sex record with a nice beat and on Thats all I know Juvenile basically used the same verse from Money on the Couch(on the SOULJA RAGS album)to complete the song. Bottom line: Wacko and Skip are the main reasons why this album stands out. Their flows are crezy plus they outrap Juvenile on every other track! No disrespect to Juve but he hasnt been the same since he dropped that sleeper album Project English."
2,"Très lent, trop lent, aucun allez","I have used this card with an 8 MP DSLR for the past five months.It has been reliable, but memory writes to the card are too slow for anything other than studio or landscape photography.Actually bought four of these cards with the camera. Am going on a trip to France this fall, and will be replacing all four with faster cards before I go.Read the ""Technical Specs"" for this card. Write speed is NOT EVEN LISTED - that is a hint.(Très lent, trop lent, aucun allez = Very slow, too slow, no go)"
1,Do not buy this,Instead look into CF1GB-40-278 (Lexar 40x) compact flash card. This one is Type 1 and slow as molasses. For about the same price the lexar card (which is Type 2) is almost 10 times faster. If you are into digital photography with atleast 3mp cameras you need to skip this card and get a faster one.
1,my experience with this item,"Yesterday was the annual Thanksgiving sale day. I got this 1G CF card from Staples by $40 after easy rebate. With this price, I think it is a great deal. However, it worked for my digital rebel only half an hour before it was DEAD. All my photos in the card were lost. I am a graduate student majoring in computer engineering, I know how to recover data if a hard drive fails. But this time, I find I simply can't help. Fortunately, Staples have a good return policy and I just returned it without hassle. Hopefully, this is only my case. My suggestion: make sure your dealer has a good return policy before you get this item."
4,It shouldn't matter,"It's kinda pointless to review a CompactFlash card - They work or they don't work - They're all poured into the same envelope -Of course THE prime expectation is that they will work in your equipment - I suppose you could count the transfers in milliseconds, but that's often beyond the domain of a memory card anyway and more to do with the electronics of the digicam - I'm using it with an E20 and have had no problems in field use - but the Oly is a relatively slow writer but that's not a chip problem - Now what would really merit 5 stars and my undying praise would be a breathtaking plunge beneath the $ barrier -- THAT'S exciting. SanDisk 1gb does the job with no problems -- THAT'S satisfying."
2,Yep..It's slow,I planned on using this in my PDA for music. Its slowness led to skipping and the more files I added the slower it got until it was unusable. I guess that's why they don't tell you the transfer rate.
5,What a pleasure!,"The 1 gig capacity eliminates the worry of ever running out of space. In my Nikon, this card affords me close to 800 frames. More than I can imagine using even on a photo vacation.The quality is superb. I highly recommend this SanDisk SDCFB-1024-A10 1GB CF Type 1 Card."
5,a collection of interviews with one of our great talkers,"Truman Capote once said that he loved talking more than anything else. Inge's book is a collection of interviews with the great talker himself, covering the period from 1948, when Capote burst on the literary scene with his first novel, ""Other Voices, Other Rooms,"" to a 1980 self-interview from ""Music for Chameleons."" It includes the complete texts of George Plimpton's important ""New York Times Book Review"" interview upon the publication of Capote's masterpiece ""In Cold Blood"" and Eric Norden's lengthy 1968 ""Playboy"" interview, both involving Capote's claim to have invented a new literary form, the ""nonfiction novel."" These interviews make clear why we must sometimes take Capote with a grain of salt, and why we must take his work as seriously as he took it himself."
5,Good deal!,"My dogs loved these rawhides. It was a great value for the price; better than pet stores. Unlike some brands, these didn't stain."
2,BDU shorts,"Well the shorts looked good and fit well, but I had to re sew every button on the shorts as the buttons were all about to fall off and one did i guess in shipping"
2,Don't buy it if you're an experienced programmer,"This book contains very little meat for my taste. I can't believe that, as a book devoted to Windows error messages, it does not even mention the Windows NT Event Log anywhere! I'm returning the book since I can't find much in the book that adds to my experience.Perhaps new programmers can learn a thing or two from this book such as the three elements of good error messages. But as an experienced developer, I'm totally disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to any of my peers."
2,hard to follow,The dancing was fabulous but that is all I can recommend. I found the story very hard to follow. The music left me cold. The sets and costumes were clever.I watched this when it was on PBS. I am very glad i did not spend the money on a DVD. I made myself watch to the end but i have no desire to see it again.
3,Warm it up Kris,Not sure why I bought this. I guess at the time I wanted something on Kris Kross. Guess I was desperate. I recently threw the tape away. Who needs tapes anymore. It was good when I originally bought it.
5,Pure Genius,"You'll want to sit back and listen to this album from start to finish without doing anything else - definitely try listening with headphones. This is trippy psychedelic pop with influences from Kraftwerk to Iggy Pop and everything in between. Unbelievably excellent production, songwriting, and vocals. The title may scare some people off, but the theme of the album as you may guess is organized religion and how it has screwed our society up - excellent lyrics that are never preachy. Why is Julian Cope not much more famous and why has this album been deleted without ever receiving the publicity it deserves? Probably because the major labels want us to consume ""Safe"" music. This is one of Julian Cope's 4 masterpieces (my favourite one overall)- the others being Peggy Suicide, Autogeddon, and 20 Mothers."
5,One of most eye-opening releases of the 90's,"Julian Cope hit a creative peak in the early 90's with Peggy Suicide and then this album. Peggy Suicide was more commercially viable, but Jehovahkill is a genuine powerhouse. Musically all over the map -- from the pop bliss of ""The Mystery Trend"" and ""Fa-Fa-Fa Fine"" to blistering Krautrock primal scream therapy (""Upwards at 45 Degrees"", ""The Subtle Energies Commission"") to techno-dance (""Poet Is Priest""). On the closing mother-goddess ""war of the genders"" epic, ""The Tower"", Cope recalls The Doors' ""The End"", sounding uncannily like Jim Morrison at times. This album is a feast of musicianship and experimentalism with a cynical, mystical neo-hippy edge that only arch drude Julian can deliver so perfectly. A classic."
3,Dear Santa,"What could a cat pawsibly want for Christmas? Well, this collection of letters to Santa reveals the inner thoughts, hopes, dreams and desires of felines. Does your cat really want another mouse toy? Cats' Letters to Santa will enlighten you.(This is a smaller than average book written to get a chuckle from people who ""get"" felines. It would be an interesting addition to Christmas decorations for the cat fanatic.)"
1,waaay too noisy for a home theater/media center environment,"The fan built into this card was 10x louder than the two larger fans built into my media center pc. I could not bear to keep the pc on in my living room with this card installed. Unfortunately its past compusa's unresonably short return period, and visiontek will not give me a refund either. These cards that are made for HD/media center must start publishing their noise levels or they are just trying to fool consumers into buying them. Had to go with a passively cooled card for that reason."
3,nice entry-level gaming but no fan speed control,"This is the final revision of the X1000-series 4-processor video card from ATI. It's relatively fast for the money. The only real 'problem' is that they used a cheap cooling fan which has no control circuit to moderate its speed. So even when you're not gaming, and the card's not working hard or getting hot, the fan runs full-speed. It's not horribly loud or anything but it is easily recognizable, a constant 'hisss' noise. I'm probably going to return mine since this is an unnecessary distraction.BTW I also tried both 'ATI Tools' and 'ATI Tools Trays' and neither utility could monitor the fan speed or control it. And when I looked at the fan itself it just had a 2-wire connector, i.e, there was physically no way to monitor the speed (that requires a 3-wire)."
3,not as good as I expected,"Was recommended by Dell rep for my system. Graphics in some games look great, but still too much flickering and freeze ups regardless of the adjustments made to card or games graphics display."
1,would not buy this item again,"It is not working right out from the box. Yes I got my refund back, but wasted 2 whole weeks just to order, wait, installed, and found out it is not working, then RMA argh....Yes, Tiger Direct refund the amount minus shipping (to and back). Next time I will buy from a local store it would had saved me time and some shipping money."
1,Poor customer service,"The product that I bought for my father looked like a great deal, but part of is showed up broken and poorly packaged, and the description given overstated the actual product performance. Upon trying to get a return authorization it took 2 voicemails before I reached someone on the third try in as many days. The return policy insinuates that if returned within 7 days a full refund will be given, upon my return I was charged a 15% restock fee. Do not recommend the product or the company LG Outdoors."
5,Wonderful CD !,"I knew this CD was going to be great and I wasn't disappointed. To hear those old classics by Paul & Paula, really brings back memories of the time that this duo was popular. If you were a fan of Paul & Paula, you'll love this CD too. Five Stars...all the way!"
3,Confusing but entertaining crocodile soup,"I'm still slightly unsure of why this book was entitled Crocodile Soup in the first place, and I guess I felt some confusion throughout the whole book. Though the author's voice is definitely quirky, and humorous, I found her style a bit difficult to follow at times. I did not tear through this book, but rather found myself wanting to finish it but having a tough time doing so. It was thought-provoking in that I felt like I had to concentrate to keep the plot and characters straight (is that a pun?) in my mind, which in a way seemed to be what Gert was doing. I did like the characters, particularly Harry, George, and Gert, and enjoyed the manner in which Julia Darling described scenarios in such a unique manner. I would only recommend this book to people who are looking for something ""different"" to read this summer!"
3,Mom's Phone,"1. Phone was not as pictured. It was a totally different wall model. But, since she really needed a phone ASAP, it was kept.2. Color listed as white, it was really almond3. It arrived ok and in a reasonable time."
2,okay but cheap looking,"These earrings are not worth more than the $5 I paid, but they are cute and the company shipped all items promptly. The ""dangle"" part of the earring above the colored beads look like cheap plastic beads stacked on top of each other."
1,Hitchcock Collection,"I'm writing to let you know that at least 3 of your Alfred Hitchcock VHS collections are listed without giving the slightest hint of what films are included in them. I have been shopping for Hitchcock, but who is willing to buy without knowing the titles on the collections???lkc@ite.net"
2,Lots of footnotes--but not enough,"Cutsey and annoying writing wrapped around appealing, but ultimately empty ideas. Nimmons made comparisons when it supported his opinion, but when it wouldn't, he didn't. The world probably doesn't need another brutal critique of gay men: most of what Larry Kramer said long ago still holds. But this attempt to prove him wrong (without deigning to plainly state that intent) completely backfires."
2,This time the stereotypes are a lot closer to the truth,"In my experience (and I wish it were not so!), gays tend to share some unpleasant character traits, such as effeminacy or lack of masculinity, cliquishness, and lewdness. The book's chief merit is that it doesn't deny their existence, but its chief defect is that it attempts, largely unsuccessfully, to try to interpret these characteristics in a more favorable light. I agree that some of these favorable interpretations are reasonable: for example, I agree that the greater amoralism of gays opens up certain aesthetic or artistic possibilities, at least given a certain understanding of art. But from the point of view that is most interesting to me, as someone trying to assess the romantic possibilities, I disagree that something very good can be built on such things."
2,Disappointed,"I have other king sets and these sheets are much smaller. They are also very thin.Also, the picture shown does not have any stripes. The ones that I recieved have stripes."
4,Smack Darts ROCK!,"I can say that I've known them since the beginning of their music career, when they were just three: Tom, Nathan and Irakli. I've loved them since then, and even if I am back home in Switzerland now, I keep following their performances and ""growing up"" from here. Their music is a mix of rock and country, and involves your mind and body completely when you're standing in a club listening to them playing. You can see and feel how much they like what they're doing throught their songs. I highly recommend their cd E.P.1 but most of all I recommend their concert on the rock scene of New York City."
1,A steady decline,"Ok the first movie was scary I have seen in the most and it still kind of creeps me out and most horror movies don't. This movie set Freddy up to be a joke man, but at least in part four and five the acting is better. I will say one good thing about this movie didn't give it another star but at least the hero's had fears and freddy played on that, but super powers made the less scary. Oh ok I just imagine something than I kill Freddy with it, this reminds me of a later episode as well where freddy and the dream have a imagination stand off. This was at least too early in the serious for this should to happen should have been a movie or two later. I don't know why people like this movie but to me it plain reeks!"
1,It [stinks],"How anyone could think this was scarier than the first is beyond me. It was so [weak]. Freddy was good for one movie okay, no more Freddy, he's dead face it, people don't like scary movies anymore, they like Scream. Horror is diseased. Too the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween I'm sorry. RIP. We will no longer get real horror. We had a peak with The Exorcist, and went down hill from there. The first was scary, the rest [stink]!"
5,Horribly beautiful,"One heck of a film. This was the first ELM STREET film I saw and I really got into the series after this. This fantasy horror is so much better than any FRIDAY 13TH because its original, and has a plot. The ending to this is one of the best/ clever endings to a horror film and Freddy moves to different heights of evil (ie: turns into a snake, puppet, nurse and he wears a tuxedo.)Simply brilliant, horror fans miss this at your peril!"
4,EXCITING FX FILLED SEQUEL! 3 1/2 STARS!,"I am reviewing the entire Nightmare on Elm Street series, but not this DVD release. I own the box set and I wanted to do individual reviews for each film.Probably the best of the sequels 'The Dream Warriors' has a bigger budget and a new wisecracking Freddy. If your going to churn out film after film, then why not have some fun with it? At this point the films aren't even trying to be scary, but they make good Halloween night picks! The DVD transfer is very good."
4,Third times the charm,"Dream Warriors is one of the best elm street films in the franchise. Although Freddy was already a popular villian, this is the film that put him on the map, it made him part of pop culture. Then-unknowns Patricia Arquette and Laurence (Larry) Fishburn give some of the films most humanic performances. Its films like this that make horror movies surpass some harsh critisism. While it wasn't a scary picture its certainly entertaining nonetheless. It boasts some of the most imaginative FX of its day. Although the characterizations were a bit stereotypical, the teen victims get more sympathy from me than any one of the nameless Friday the 13th victims ever did. Watch out for those flying tongues. ****"
4,Wes Craven breathes life back into the series,"""A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" picks up 6 years after the original ""Nightmare"" ended, totally disregarding the storyline from Part 2. Heather Langenkamp returns as Nancy Thompson, Freddy's main opponent from the first film, as a Dream Specialist working with the remaining Elm Street Kids, who are now housed in a psychiatric hospital for sleep deprivation. After several murders at the hands of Krueger, Nancy takes the rest of the kids and helps them band together to form the ""dream warriors"", so they can put Freddy to rest once and for all. The acting is fantastic by all involved, especially for Heather Langenkamp, who seems to feel more comfortable in her role this time around (although she is given much less to do). This is my second favorite flick out of the series, it has suspense, horror and surprises throughout. Rent it!"
5,Freddy's Back,Freddy Returns in Dream Warriors fallowing a teribblemovie in Freddy's Revenge. This lives up to the orginal and may actually be better then the original. Bringing back Heather L. and her dad was a smart move. The acting in this was good and the violence was good. You must have this to be a real Freddy Fan.
4,3rd Time's a Charm!!!,"Freddy's 3rd is better than the 2nd, because he is in it more, and Nancy is back! Nancy helps teens with their nightmares at Westin Hills. Kristen has the power to bring people into her dreams. She gets help from Nancy, Joey, Kincaid, and others. Dr. Neil Gordon tries to help by burrying Freddy in holy ground and splashing his bones with holy water. This one hints about how Freddy came to be. (You find out more about that in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child') This is also kind of sad because Nancy dies toward the end. If you love the Freddy series, hopefully, you'll love A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS!!!"
5,this is gonna be a perfect movie,this was the best freddy movie oh my god it was not better than wes cravens new nightmare on elm street this is my fave elm street film i cant wait to get it on dvd im gonna watch it over & over again ill let my class watch it
3,Fairly pleasing sequel in the Elm Street Series,"This time a group of teens are in a group home for suicidial teens.All of the teens seem to share a group nightmare about a boogeyman.This time Nancy is back trying to help the teens fight Freddy.This film is pretty slow in some spots,characters are good,plus some really neat effects."
5,o ya baybay!,"I know a lot about MR.freddykruger but more than enough to know that NOES3 is the best!freddy morphs into a puppet, a snake, even a tv! it also makes up for the lame plot of NOES2!youve got to see it! its soooooooo cooooooool!!!!!!!!!1"
2,Nightmare on elm street - Wes Craven= A true Nightmare,"Freddy returns to extract revenge on the children of Elm Street. But will the powers of the group of teens and Nancy Thompson destroy Freddy for good? The film is not anything like the first or last film. Wes Craven returned to help write this film BUT he did not direct. That was a let down. This is the first film that made Freddy a staple of Pop culture. Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp, and John Saxton return along with a new face on Elm street, Laurence Fishburne. I don't think this film lived up to what it could have been. It would have generated more fear with Wes Craven directing. Not a terrible dissapointment. Not the best in the series either."
4,"A kid's review, witch one was better ? 1 or this one","I am going to say, this was a scary movie but not as scary as The Exorcist. A good part about this movie is that Nancy comes back in this film from the first one. The part that freaked me out was Freddy's mom was in the movie as a spirit. Who would have guest that this movie has a sad ending?"
5,"""Welcome to Prime Time Bitch!""","""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3-Dream Warriors"" is simply my favorite out of all the ""Elm Street"" movies. Thankfully, Wes Craven came back this time around (after refusing to be part of the sequel) and made the movie funny, exciting, innovative and down-right good.In this outing Freddy torments a bunch of teenagers housed at a psycho ward. He of course goes into their dreams and decides the fates of each character.One of the best parts of the film are some of the one-liners Craven gives Freddy such as the one in which he says to a character that cannot talk, ""What's wrong? Tongue tied are we?"" and the best line in the movie when Freddy murders a girl who wants to be a TV actress. After smashing her head into a television screen he utters, ""Welcome to Prime Time Bitch!"". Simply hilarious!This film, like the previous two, was a financial hit raking in over $44,000,000 on a $4.5,000,000 budget!"
3,"Childish horror, but fun.","Look at this... a part in the Nightmare on Elm Street series that is actually good! Unbelievable you maybe think, but this part have a script for a feature length film and characters we care for (well, at least a little bit). Some kids who have survived from Freddys nightmares are now at a bedlam cause no one believes them. Then Heather Langenkamp, who was in part 1 and the only one who believes them, start working with them and together they try to kill Freddy. Not an original story maybe and it is a bit childish, but I like it. Stupid childish fun and I didn't get bored once like I usually do in these kind of films. Well worth a look if you are in the mood."
3,"1,2 freddie comin for you","part three is a nice sequel to part 1 and 2, even though i personaly think part 2 did rubbish ,i think part 3 did much better. Thers many more murders and blood , part 3 has the best startin point in the film, even though no freddie movie succeded like part 1 this film still did pretty well."
5,A Nightmare On elm Street 3,"I Loved this movie. It is my very favorite Freddy film of all time. The plot was amazing and how they came up with it was extra good. I own every ""A nightmare on elm street"" film BEFORE they were digitally remastered. I have 563 horror movies unopened in my room. Out of all them this is my very favorate movie."
3,No Dokken Video Included,"I like this movie,except the original one was a whole lot better,because the original movie included the ""DOKKEN"" ""Dream Warriors"" music video at the end of the film!"
3,Love the layout! But so small!!,"Very small book, few words but the layout is incredible. If this was a bigger dictionary - this would be fantastic! Right now, it's kind of like a ""sample"" of a dictionary. lol. Thankfully, I only borrowed the book and didn't pay for it!"
3,A good beginners guide,"This book is beautiful. It has many wonderful pictures of the many varieties of dwarf cichlids, both New World and African. However, the lack of content makes it not very valuble for the advanced aquarian. It tells very little about the habitats needed by the different types of dwarf cichlids. It does not tell what tank size each type of cichlid needs, nor does it address the Ph and hardness needed by the various cichlids. The pictures, while clearly labeled, are not with the descriptions of the dwarf cichlids they show. While you can use this book to find pictures of dwarf cichlids that you may be interested in, you will have to go elsewhere to learn how to keep them in their optimal enviroment."
2,Dwarf Cichlids by david Boruchowiztz,"I was very disappointed by this book. Vague and woolly. It didn't address the specifics needs for breeding Apistogrammas for example. Great pictures, but you can get great pictures free on the net. The quality of the photography is first rate and if you want a book just for browsing occasionally then its fine."
3,One great George Harrison songs and 21 other tracks to skip,"This is an interesting last statement for Harrison--he's a bit angry and rocking. The song basically sounds like a Cloud Nine-era Harrison track (a great one), but the rest of the disc does nothing for me. A bunch of swing [junk]. Even some of my favorite artists (Joe Strummer, Van Morrison) are not at their best here."
3,"5 for George, 3 for the rest.","I'll be honest I bought this for the Harrison cut. I don't think he sounds weak, I think he sounds older. Compare Sting of old and Sting today, Does he sound weak, No, -older IMHO. The balance of the album is not something I will listen to often and I like blues and R n B. Perhaps it is because there is such a mix of styles here as others have mentioned. I suppose the point I am trying to make here is that if George Harrison wasn't on this cd I and thousands of others would pass this cd up."
2,Your Parent's Music,"Well, there are about three good cuts on this CD, out of 22. The George Harrison song is a nice take on his ""All Things Must Pass""/Phil Spector sound, and probably worth the price. [The Paul Carrack and Mark Knopler contributions are pretty good too.] But there are some real rotten things here! The totally repellant Marc Almond song, the painful fake soul of Eric Clapton (hint: shut up and play the guitar, you're not Ray Charles), the truly embarrassing John Cale take on 'I Wanna Be Around...', the grim 'Revolution' by some half-dead Cobain wannabe...I could go on, but I won't.The whole thing comes across as a karaoke evening at some dismal club, with a terrible big band instead of the canned backings, and unsuspecting guests being asked to do 'their thing'. The arrangements are blarey and annoying, just like the hams who used to back sixties TV shows in Britain. I couldn't wait for it to be over!"
3,Overdone,"Good stuff here, but someone needs to learn the art of understatement. It's just too busy. Still, I'd recommend it - just seems like it could have been SO much better.In short- jeez, give it a break, will ya?"
4,An original mix!,"OK, this is an odd mix! but some of the tracks are great! It has everything from the blues to Ska! However, the track which will gain most attention is George Harrison's. Harrison's voice sounds in faltering shape! The Eric Clapton is a good track, and there are many gems in this album!"
4,Important subject -- right book,Help is an important subject that should not be forgotten by programmers.This small book ( < 200p !) puts all the tools in hand so that you can keep help files up to date with the development of your software.Worth reading it !
5,An important and thought-provoking Zeitgeist book!,"This is a warning-shot tome such as Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring,"" Christopher Lasch's ""The Culture of Narcissism"" and Jonathan Schell's ""The Fate of the Earth."" It articulates what many of us have been thinking (and worrying) about, and it has the potential to shake us up and change the way we look at ourselves, how we live, and the kind of crazy, fast-paced world we've created."
4,Great ofering and shipping-not so much a great movie,"It isn't ever going to be considered a masterpiece, but it was fun to watch and even funnier to see the totally 70s atmosphere.The movie came quickly and it was the perfect gift for the Lords of Dogtown fan-"
3,Skatbored: The Movie,"Skateboard (Skateboard: The Movie) (1978) is a very bad film of the 70's skating scene, including skateboarding chump Tony Alva.The best sequence was the teen pin-up puke queen Leif Garrett at the skateboarding championships that contrasted the original skateboarding style with that of late 1980's skateboarding.This 70's exploitation film represents a then unprecedented look at the birth of an exploitative counter-culture that unfolds right before your despicable eyes.How about a little skateboarding action?"
1,*****DO NOT BY ANYTHING FROM SUPERSWORDCENTER*****,"I made a purchase on June 4,2006 forTwin Full Tang Black Ninja Sword W/sheath Blade Katana but I have not received my producted or the status of my producted,the only response I got was "", Did you receive your product,"" and thas it nothing since them. I really recommend not buying anything from them because they'll just stiff you with their terrible customer service. I am already in the process of filling a claim for the return of my funds."
5,DISNEY PLEASE RE RELEASE THIS MOVIE!!!!,"THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY DISNEY MOVIE BUFF OR ANYONE WHO LOVES GOOD OLD MOVIES!! I REMEMBER THIS MOVIE VERY WELL FROM MY CHILDHIOOD AND IT BRINGS BACK SUCH WONDERFUL MEMORIES OF LAYING ON THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR WATCHING THE ""WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY"" AND ""WILD KINGDOM"" MAKES ME SAD THAT MY KIDS WONT HAVE THOSE MEMORIESPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DISNEY PUT THIS OUT ON DVD SOOOONTHANK YOU!!!"
3,Only three because it's been so long,"I remember seeing this movie aired on the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" on Sunday Night. This, I believe, was not produced by Disney, but produced separately [in Canada?] and the rights were purchased.Without giving too much away, this is the story [from what I remember] of a young boy who meets a girl of his own age living in his house. The twist is that she has been dead for a number of years and is a ghost. The boy helps her try to remember how she died so she can finally rest.There are some interesting plot twists and although some of the special effects wouldn't measure up to today's standards, they are effective in conveying the story with just the right amount of creepiness. [And no smarmy-ness, which is unfortunately typical of alot of Disney made-for-tv movies.].I would love to find this in DVD, even paired with another forgotten gem in the Disney vaults."
5,I'll chime in with the rest.,"Hopefully, Amazon will put this in their DVD log so they can begin accepting votes for its release. Disney needs to know that there is a market for this film. It's a real classic and deserves another chance at life rather than being crammed in the back of the Disney vault. Please bring it out! I'd love to be able to share this one with my kids."
5,Child of Glass,"Disney needs to get moving on this one! As a child I remember seeing this and absolutely loved it. The wee ones of today (and their parents) don't know what they're missing. What I enjoyed most about this story is the poignant emotion of the title character, the desperate desire to be at peace, to finally rest, and not be allowed to. And when you see the events which put them in this state it moves you even more. The ending brought a tear to my eye. Like so many others I have been searching for this film for years, and hope to see it available VERY soon. A++++++++++"
5,My favorite childhood movie!,"I watched a Disney movie every week on Sunday evenings for years. Of the hundreds I'd seen, Child of Glass was my favorite one. It's a wonderfully haunting tale! I have seen it only once on TV in the last twenty-something years. Sure wish I could see it more. A must see for everyone who likes a good ghost story. I can't wait to share it with my chilren. It's too bad that this film is not more widely recognized....it's so rare that Disney does not even list it on their A-Z listing on thier web site. I personally feel that it's one of thier best classics."
4,A Classic from Disney Television,"This movie shows its age, but it is still an excellent example of classic Disney television movies. Bordering on the occult, this will not be to everyone's taste, but like ""Watcher in the Woods,"" the show holds you in suspense, despite some crude FX. Disney should do a restoration of the film like they did with Watcher. Of the ""Generations"" series, this is probably the very best of the bunch. I've rated it four stars largely because of the quality of the picture and sound. Otherwise, the story and performances are top notch."
5,Fabulous,I have been looking for this movie for over twenty years and could not believe my luck when I found it.
4,Great movie to have on DVD,"I remember watching this on Disney Presents with my Mom, I had remembered the rhyme ""Sleeping lies the murdered lass, vainly cries the child of glass, when the two become one the spirits journey will be done"" for all these years. Admittedly the quality is not that of the new DVD releases but considering the age of the movie the quality is great, much better than the dubbed from tv VHS I have! If you love these classic movies, you need to get this! I am waiting for Not Quite Human to come out!"
1,Boot Legged Product ???,"The movie was like a boot legged video... NOT a Disney movie, NO Walt Disney Castle Credit or anything Disney. Beginning scene as I saw when I was younger was missing and you could see blippy black, white and yellow spots on the screen like you would see in an older projection film.No chapter/scene selections or anythingNOT worth the $18 ..."
5,Child of Glass,I loved this movie when it 1st was shown on the Disney channel. I would watch it every time they showed it around Halloween. Wish there where movies like this one. My children grew-up with Disney movies and now my grandchildren watch them. My children and I no matter how old we are we love all the Disney movies old and new.
3,OK reference tool,"Inexpensive reference tool, but not terribly helpful. I haven't found much occasion to use it, but who knows-which is why I keep it on hand."
4,"Very Rockin"" DNC cd","This DNC cd comes out of nowhere and hits the pedal for some 90's hard rockin southern metal. It still holds up and most songs are good. I missed this one back in the day. DNC Smokes through this underated cd. Original lineup in tact, go see them live!!"
3,Smoke Signals,"For a band once labelled as quirky rootsy rockers, this effort doesn't half sound like AC/DC as in 'She Doesn't Wanna Go' or -gulp!- Motorhead even. On the flipside their more familiar style does bring to mind ol' Cranky himself, Bob Dylan, particularly on 'What Difference Does It Make'. However my main gripe with 'Smoke' is that it lacks fire. I dunno, but at times the music's too dense, too stodgy and the songs tend to blend into sub-metal riffery with Kenny's raspy vocals dissolving into a whine. But if you stick with it 'Smoke' does send some good signals, the punchy and impassioned 'Eastern European' being a good example, or how about the no-nonsense rocker 'Turn It Up'. A fine live band with a commendable recorded history, but the verdict must be can do better."
4,Buy DNC,DNC is great rock music. I don't know how you would really classify them as they are not metal or hard rock. They just rock and have a unique sound.
2,"""Smoke"" Doesn't Catch Fire","Quirky southern rockers Drivin'N'Cryin' followed up their best album, 1991's masterpiece ""Fly Me Courageous,"" with the album that is easily their worst. Whereas ""Courageous"" is loaded with top notch songwriting and killer hooks, ""Smoke"" is marred by a decided absence of the same. Even when it starts to take off, like on the intermittentaly powerful ""Patron Lady Beautiful,"" or the beautifully accoustic ""What's the Difference,"" inappropriate sonic intrusions mar the groove. It's as if the band deliberately sabotaged their strengths in an effort to avoid merely repeating their past success. The second half is considerably better than the first, and the best song on the disc is rocking ""Whiskey Soul Woman.""Overall, a failed effort that marked the beginning of DNC's unfortunate fade into obscurity. At their best, they were a force to be reckoned with."
3,I prefer unrealistic water,"The realism confused me, and since I haven't been the same since the film Inception, I need my lines clearly drawn."
4,Easy no fuss diorama water,Adding water effects to a diorama takes it to the next level. Lots of different products like casting resin look great but are labor intensive (adding and measuring catalyst) but this product is simple: pour and let it dry. Non-toxic and easy to use.If you make dioramas and want to add water this is perfect. Looks great when completed and is easy to work with. Just pour it in 1/8 inch layers and wait 24 hours between pourings.
4,Pretty good,"I like them, the fit pretty well, sound quality is very good, though I would expect higher from Altec Lansing. Still by far the best in it's price range.I wouldn't recommend it for production A/V use, but for online gaming, online talk features in IM software, as well as just a regular set of headphones, it's a good product."
5,Perfectly Crafted Album,"One of the year's most overlooked albums. Nourallah writes gorgeous pop songs, but he's done more than that. Each song explores themes and issues raised elsewhere on the album, but from new perspectives (different narrators, different points in time, etc.) without ever being heavy-handed. It's a very strong album worthy of attention from anyone interested in songcraft or the album-as-album style of art."
4,Nice Christmas CD.,"Nice Christmas CD, loved most of the songs. Hopefully they will all grow on me over time but still nice to have."
4,good song,Good product. this item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.
1,Not suitable for children................,"The undertones present in this album are in no way suitable for a good christian household. mariah promotes materialsm and glutony in this album, and our children must not hear it.Good Christians, stay away!!!!"
3,Mariah Merry Christmas CD,"She has a beautiful voice but do not need the high screamy notes in the songs, so my husband and I were very disappointed."
4,MARIAH RULES,"Mariah Christmas album really shows off her talent. My favorites are ""All I Want For Christmas Is You"" and ""Baby Please Come Home"""
5,A classic Christmas album!,"I know we all love ""All I Want For Christmas Is You"". That song is reason enough to get this album, it's the best original christmas song to come out in the last 15-20 years! For the hardcore ""lambs"", this is a must have because of the videos, they're great fun for Mariah fanatics. However, the regular album is more than enough if you're just a fan of great holiday music. Mariah Carey created a perfect holiday gift and everyone should get this album and enjoy it during the holidays!"
5,What Pop Christmas is Supposed to sound like,"This is one of the best Christmas albums ever. She delivers each of the songs is a new way. She rocks out these songs with her 5 octave range.She sings the old traditional songs and makes it sound like it was made for her. She also has quite a few of new holiday songs to add to the collection, like the most famous ""All i want for Christmasis you"".I thought that her rendition of Holy Night was amazing. They way she interprets the song is absolutly mind blowing.This CD is a MUST to have in your Holiday Collection...."
5,My favorite Christmas album,"I love Mariah's Christmas album. I've had it for a while and play it every year around Christmas. The songs are rich, beautiful and touching. ""O Holy Night"" in particular is amazing! Her voice is heavenly. I would highly recommend this to anybody who can appreciate good voice work!"
3,Silent Night,"Didn't really care for her rendition of Silent Night, but the rest of the CD is pretty good."
3,There are MORE than 5 songs on here that I enjoy. 3.9 stars.,All I Want For Christmas Is You (Best X-Mas song ever. Made Me tear up twice! No other songs do that!)Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) Lovely. The second best song here. It's so sad. Deals with longing for love and loneliness with nothing better to do than to think about HIM...*Le Sigh*Silent NightO Holy NightThe only filler songs that are here are Oh Jesus and Hark! The Herold.Glad I got it.Miss You Most is the second best X-Mas track I've ever heard.3.9 stars.
3,Retired Lady,"I love MiMi anything she sing but, I must say this was a little disapointing. I was look for a more traditional CD not a here and now."
5,Great Holiday Album,"This has got to be one of the best Christmas albums ever made. Every track on this CD is spectacular and Mariah performs these tracks without changing them too much from the original classics so anyone who listens can really appreciate them. The DVD side of this is also very enjoyable, along with the new version of Santa Claus is Comin' to Town. I didn't think it was possible for even Mariah to do a better rendition than the original album version. The new version is very soulful and sounds old school, like something The Jackson 5 would've performed."
5,Still the ALL Time best Christmas Album,"This is the best Christmas Album I still had since it came out. My brother bought it for me on the year 1994 and I still have everything in original package. I listen to this every Christmas time and I have bought other Christmas cd's like Christina Aguilera, Just got Jessica Simpson's and others I can't remember. Nothing beats this cd. If you are looking for a good Christmas album I highly recommened this first before you sample any other. If I have a second choice I would pick: Now thats What I call music Christmas album. Thats really good too!"
5,O holy night!,"Wow! This album really exemplifies the holiday season for me. I think this album speaks for itself when you look at how popular it is after being around for 10 years. I understand there are a lot of Christmas albums that are a lot older that 10 years that sell very well every year, but most of those people(Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, etc) are not ridiculed in the media(I know she's done some crazy stuff - TRL/popsicle episode anyone? ) or talked about all the time like Mariah. Anyways, off the soapbox...This CD is SO GOOD! She sounds PERFECT (naturally) and the songs are spot-on! It's just superb! buy it! buy it! buy it!"
5,This is an excellent Christmas CD,"I loved Merry Christmas! Mariah was great on this album, and she didn't really wail the high notes like she tends to do on her other CDs. Her tone was very warm, and very subdued, which I loved. The best must have been ""All I want for christmas is you."" If you're looking for a good CD for Christmas, this is definitely a must have!"
4,great,This is probably one of the best christmas cds made by a popstar. I advise everyone to get it because after all mariah can really sing on this album. Not like that annoying flute whisper thing she calls singing now.
4,All for one song,"This is a lovely Christmas album. and the best track on it. which makes the song worthy isthe ballad.""Jesus, Born on this day""."
5,One of my favorite Xmas CDs,"I actually bought this CD when it was released 6 (yes 6) years ago. Mariah really puts a new spin on old classics. She also has some new holiday classics. ""All I Want For Christmas"" is one of the best songs on this CD. I also like ""Jesus, What A Wonderful Child""."
3,Typical Mariah,"This is a pretty good Christmas cd IF, and only IF you like Mariah Carey. Her ear-piercing version of Oh Holy Night is one of the worst i've heard ever. Her vocal gymnastics are not suited to traditional-style Christmas music. The up-tempo pop Christmas songs she does are good, but otherwise i think she should stick to her own material. Not every artist is suited to doing traditional religious Christmas songs. Celine Dion is another one guilty of that."
1,Mariah Carey,"MC can't sing: she's just another Whitney Houston imitator whose only entertainment value is showing off her body!The traditional Christmas Carol ""Joy to the World "" track is positively contaminated, no.. blasphemed, by mixing in parts of the 3 Dog Nite song of the same title.In summary, this album SUCKS!!!"
4,Great CD!,"This CD has great renditions of favorite X-mas songs, plus Mariah's amazing voice. A tad too religious to give it five stars, however."
1,Christmas shouldn't be bootylicious...,"Mariah's beautiful voice belongs more on the dance floor than on a Christmas album. ""All I want for Christmas is You"" is one of the worst in this respect, though it remains one of the most overplayed songs on the radio. The slinky, spandex Santa suit on the front cover tells you all you need to know. Christmas music should not sound bootylicious. Several other tracks on this album share that sound (though not all of them). If you're looking for something more traditional, look elsewhere."
1,Ah Mariah,"Does this woman know how to sing a song the way it was written? Just sing it and it will become your own, woman. You don't have to add 50 notes to every note written just to show off your voice. This has got to be the most annoying CD every produced. I returned it."
5,Best Christmas Album Available,"This is a Christmas album everyone must get . It is simply traditional and yet the same time up to date . ""All I Want For Christmas Is You"" is a very up-beating song and you can dance to it . ""Miss You Most"" is a very touching song that has like a story in it . It is for those who are missing someone . While the other songs are traditional Christmas songs , she made them so much better ."
5,"Merry Christmas, to your ears!!","Anyone that says a women with such tremendous vocal talent cannot make an awesome christmas must have broken eardrums. I must say Miss Carey has a divine gift from god. These songs are classicaly arranged and is something you would listen to with anyone ranging from your children to your friends at a christmas party. Christmas productions from other artists like Christina Aguilera, Destinys Child are sooo over produced and oversang...simply these artists have tried to produce an album with same calibur as Miss Mariah Carey...but fail in doing so...just remember there is only ONE MARIAH CAREY...and this cd will prove to any doubting listener just how powerful her set of 7 octave pipes are...simply amazing...I cant say enough!!"
1,Oh No She Didn't!,"Don't tell me Mariah re-released her Christmas album as a dual disc now!? God, she's only just released the fourth edition of The Emancipation Of Mimi! She should quit it already. Stick with the original albums to teach her a lesson!"
1,Celine dion she's not!,"Celine version of O holy night blows her's out the water and then some! Celine album has 16 songs on it - not 10, this album is trite and tacky selection: santa claus this and that. while Celine's Christmas album is Classy, well done and timeless."
1,"She puts the ""ho"" into ""Ho! Ho! Ho!""","Make it stop! Make it stop!!IF Mariah Carey had recorded this when she was drunk or stoned, it would have sounded one hell of a lot better! As it stand, she just does all her usual aimless, pointless and pretentious vocalising.Drink more booze before you record music, Ms Carey! It might help a lot!Expect to see this turkey in the bargain bins in supermarkets, along with the horrendous Destiny's Child ""Ex-mas"" album."
1,Mariah has proven herself to be an industry tramp.......,"2005 has shown the true side of mariah, and has shown her greed and hatred for her fans. She knows that they will buy anything that has her name on it, and she is effectively exploiting this!!!!mariah is a ho ho ho ho ho ho!!"
1,Merry Christmas Mariah Carey Review,"I bought this album, and I don't like it. I took it back to the store, and got me a refund. The album is compeletely boring. Never again will I ever buy another Mariah Carey Cd! Fool me once, but not again!"
3,Mostly overdone,"Mariah is a pop singer, with a powerful voice. This is a collection for the popular music listener, as by now several of the tracks are standard for seasonal radio. With the strong vice as her one trick at this early point in her career, Mariah tends to overdo it, especially on `Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)' and `Santa Claus is Coming to Town' . She does dial it back a bit for the solemn `Jesus Born on This day', but the whole thing still sounds a bit too much like she is leading a church choir."
2,Bleeky Christmas,"I bought this album thinking I was gonna enjoy some Christmas music but this CD just didn't sit well with me. I was skipping through the songs bigtime. Oh Holy night was so boooring and seemed to drag on forever especially in the first 2 long drawn out verses. Most of the other selections were just average or borderline 'typical Christmas song'. I honestly don't recommend this as a worthwhile purchase.Other christmas albums which I purchased from Amazon were Celine Dion's 'These Are Special Times' and 'Christmas Extraordinaire', Mannheim . Now these 2 albums are Christmas Master-Pieces. Don't miss out on these two."
2,mariah may have the best selling christmas album,but elvis presley's best selling album of all time is his christmas album. If this album was most popular it would have outsold music box
1,"Merry Christmas, and a happy bank account","Trust mariah to be first on the badwagon of Dual Disc re-releases of older albums. Considering she is releasing a fifth version of her mimi album late december, this comes as no suprise!!Give this a pass, and show the music industry that we are not lambs who fork out our hard earned cash for any trashy release!!"
2,The voice is raspy and thin,I wouldn't recommend this CD. It's not very well produced and her voice sounds tired in quite a few of the songs. I don't like the arrangements. Think of Hip Hop rhythms and pumping beats and off color lyrics. I don't see this as a Christmas album. Who wants rappers beats for Christmas! Horrendous. I prefer light upbeat melody's at this special time of year. This cd just puts me in a bad mood.
1,A contrived and substance-free christmas album,"This album is as flat as they come, and the dual disc re-release is as cheap and lame as they get! Don't waste your hard-earned cash on such a lame sounding album, from an artist who seems to love 're-releasing' every mediocre album she 'creates'. Her greed is disgraceful, and her fans are blind (and deaf)!!At least she is skinny on this album cover, unlike her recent bulging pattern."
1,"An utterly offensive christmas album, to both Jesus and Christians","Mariah spreads some offensive messages throughout this album, and hints that lust is what we all, as humans, want for christmas. She offends the memory of jesus, our savior, who died for her sins, just so she can get some implants and wear a short dress. jesus would be appalled at the message spread by this so called 'christmas' album. Her musical whoring is unacceptable, and good christians should avoid this album at all costs."
4,Christmas Songs,I absolutely love this CD. I had it on cassette and upgraded to the CD this year -- 2007. It really puts me in the Christmas mood.Merry Christmas
4,Have a Merry Christmas with Mariah,"I have had this CD for years now,{since it first came out} It has since become a classic in my home, and is played every Christmas. Mariah Carey was meant to sing Christmas songs, her high octave voice makes the music ""soar"" yet she still has her own ""sound"" to make the Christmas songs her own.I would highly recommend this CD as a gift since anyone should just luv it."
3,Intervention programs for young urban African American men.,"This book covers theories, research and intervention programs which were or are designed to address issues that young African-American men face in urban areas. It explores the role of culture in social development, articulates cluster profiles of racial socialization, identifies oppression and sociopolitical development as an basis for intervention, draws a relationship among gender, spirituality and spiritual well-being, compares manhood and womanhood development, and links these factors with the cognitive, emotional and behavioral characteristics of African boys and men. In its survey, it affirms the known and leaves the practicioner with much of the same overwhelmedness about the challenges and issues of Black boys and men in the U.S."
3,so so,"Take Autechre + Prefuse73 + Ming and Fs + Groove Armada and add a dash of Massive attack and you get Funkstorung. This is a sonically interesting album, highlighted by ""chopping Heads"" w/ Tes and the ""stirring captured in tones"" w/ Sarah Jay. So, why only 3 stars? One word. Enik. His vocals lyrics completely drag this album down--and unfortunately he's on the majority of the songs.Take ""like a Poet"" a likable, melodic song, but with lyrics such as, ""like a poet, 'cause you're a poet, you just don't know it"" ruin it...way to rhyme ""poet"" with ""poet"" and then ""it"", spent hours pouring over your thesaurus did you, Enik?Remove the vocals on all Enik songs and this album gets another star. Seriously, he's terrible."
1,1st Edition was Better - Stay Away,"I am aware that there is now a 3rd edition (Programming Python) out now of this series, but I cannot in good conscience not comment about the problem with this particular edition.I own the first and second editions. I heartily recommend the 1st over the 2nd. In fact, the 2nd edition is actually missing material from the first - even though the 2nd is ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE of the first.This is the worst part.. the best reason to even own the 1st edition (the only reason basically IMHO) is a section near the back of the book. And get this.. thats the only part they took out for the second edition.Thats right, they added a bunch of useless text, and gutted the only thing that made the first edition of any value.I have both on my bookshelf, the 2nd edition is in perfect condition and collects dust. The 1st is worn from use. Take from that what you will."
4,Directionally Correct,"The Timex Compass watch looks nice, fits well, and performs as expected. I'd recommend this a a gift for the outdoors person."
1,"OK Watch, Useless Compass","All I can say about this watch is that it keeps time and has a nice Indiglo backlight. The compass is useless. Every time I've calibrated the compass it seems at first to be OK, but a few days later it's way off again. I made sure not to store it near any metallic or magnetic objects, but it still goes bonkers. Now it won't even calibrate any more - when I rotate the watch 360 degrees in the horizontal plane after ""calibration"", the compass needle won't turn a complete circle. Yeah, this watch is much cheaper than other compass watches, but the compass is useless and it's expensive for a cheap watch. If you want a compass watch that works, get a Casio or Suunto - much more money but actually functional."
3,Outdoor watch,"I bought this one to add to a starting collection of compass-watches. Well in term of functionnalities this is a very good watch. Reading is in a blink of an eye, the compass is very accurate but a little tricky to calibrate. Indiglo is the best for night reading but a little short when using the compass in real situation. Very comfortable to wear, fits all wrist (even wrists of guys who like to chop wood in the deep forest...)Beware the wristband is not standard and has to be replaced with one of the brand.To Sum up, a very good item for its price like every timex expedition line of products."
2,help with compass calibration,"I had this watch for about 3 years. I find the compass calibration non-intuitive. I haven't used it for over a year, and now I wanted to use it. Unfortunately, I lost the manual, and I couldn't figure out how to calibrate the compass. I went to the Timex website and find it totally useless. The website doesn't contain any instructions how to calibrate. Can anyone of you help me out? Would appreciate it."
3,"Good good, but no t the best of them.","This was one of the best Rock & Pop bands in Argentina. They make us feel lot of sensations, and no one of Argentina, cant say that didnt dance or sing with them.The band, was also wellknowed, in Latin America y Miami."
5,Hell Yea...,A great album from the beginning til the end. Cop this out if you can find it. Just got myself a copy and i have a feeling its gonna be a quite a resident in my CD changer.
5,One of the best albums that came out of the Acid Jazz era,"...along with The Brand New Heavies two first albums, ""The Apostles"" by the Apostles (not Apostles the rock band), ""True Spirit"" by Carleen Anderson and ""Vivienne McKone"" by Vivienne McKone..."
4,Good job,"While the CD case was a little grungy, the CD itself was in good condition. I am pleased with the results."
3,Out of order,"I didn't pick this up via Amazon, but this review will still hold true. The songs are not in the order mentioned on the cover. This bothers me quite a bit. I am on song 3 (supposedly Living on the Edge), but this is definitely Sweet Emotion. I am a big enough fan to recognize the song. There should have been better quality control. I mean, the order of the songs in general doesn't matter, but it should match the jacket cover. Makes me wonder whether the rest of the songs listed on the cover will really be on the disc."
1,NOT AGAIN!!!!`,"Just what we need from Aerosmith, ANOTHER Greatest Hits Package with a few new songs thrown in to get people to buy it!!! Pure Schlock!!!Don't bother buying this one pick up one of the other 27 greatest hits albums they have had out over the past 20 years!!!!"
1,Completely unnecessary...,Why release this compilation? We already have Aerosmith's Greatest Hits. Go and get that instead.
1,Give us a break!,"This is for the kids, because there's nothing here for the fans. We've had this stuff for years. As far as the new songs go...we may be older, but we sure as heck know how to download! We've got money-just don't want to waste it. How about a decent concert DVD!"
2,"Buy O, Yeah The Ultimate Aerosmith Hits","I love everything they have released but if you seriosly wanna buy a greatest Hits album of this band, Don't buy this one They left off a couple of there Number 1's some songs are cut way to short Like take ""Livin on the Edge"" it's original runtime is 6:21 on this album it's two minutes shorter, and ""Walk This Way"" buy Run DMC and Aerosmith is originally 5:11 and on here it's 3:40 and theres a few more songs that are cut like this. I mean seriously what happend in the studio come on guys release something better than this. But hey I do give you credit there is two brand new songs on here the title song and Sedona Sunrise, and there purrdy good. but seriosly if you want some good Aerosmith songs please buy O, Yeah it want disappoint your tast for Aerosmith. it may cost a little bit more. But it's worth it."
1,Not again...,"I LOVE Aerosmith, and i have for ages... but we don't need yet another greatest hits album! we're not gonna pay that much money to get two new tracks! yes it's affordable, but for an album which includes new songs you actually want to have, not to get a couple of new songs.... we need a new studio album, not another compilation!"
1,Why?,"Do we really need another Aerosmiths greatest hits cd?This collection of tunes doesn't do any justice to the band as their are just way to many good songs missing with a single disc package. Perhaps they should give a us 3 cd set package that has 70's tunes on disc one, followed by the 80's on disc two, and of course the 90's and so on, on disc three. At least this would give the listener a better perspective of what this band is all about. This effort just leaves out way to many good songs and is just a waste of time and money. Even with the two new tunes, it's still somewhat pointless really.Buy Pandora's box if you want the old stuff or O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits if you want an overall best of. Either way, their are far better hits packages from this band than this one provides, so look elsewhere!!Anyway I give the band a 5 and this compilation a 1."
2,Don't wanna miss a thing should never be on a cd with Sweet Emotion!,"If your a new fan,don't start here with this collection.You can pretty much grab any of the ""columbia"" cd's without fear.I'm listening to the ""Draw The Line"" Cd right now(great).Kids,They really were the greatest American rock band,just don't judge them on ""don't wanna miss a thing"".""Gems"" is a really good greatest hits if your looking for that sort of thing."
5,Mix Of Old And New Stuff,"This was the fifth album added to my collection here, and it holds a special place in my collection because of the date on which I found it - March 26, 2011. That's right, I found this album on Steven Tyler's birthday. The irony is his nickname is ""The Demon of Screamin'"", so that makes it all the more appropriate that I found the album on his birthday. There's one song from the JUST PUSH PLAY album on here, a ROCKIN' tune that shares its name with the album title and a really beautiful song called ""Sedona Sunrise"". Also on this album is the rap version of ""Walk This Way"", which still packs a punch some 27 years after its' release in 1986. Don't listen to the bad reviews on thsi album - this is a great album from start to finish!"
3,Music Maniac,Should have been a one hit or two hit max wonder. They did many great songs but this album is limited for their great hits. Wouldn't buy it again. Should have just bought the songs. It would have been cheaper and more satisfying.
2,terrible quality,"Even though the songs are the classics, this is guaranteed to give you a headache in no time. Yes I am using the best of tube gear there is. It is apparent that for the making of this compilation they have not used the original tapes and it sounds truly awful.Guys the reason why someone still buys a CD instead of download the mp3 is some quality even though incomparable to vinyl. If the CD sounds just like a lousy mp3 with the terrible distortion that implies, then what's the point of paying for the whole CD????"
4,"devils got a new disguise ""winner' for Aerosmith""",This latest Aerosmith is a must have for all Aerosmith fans.
3,honestly,"just a quick note: i saw aerosmith in an ice rink in 1978, and they played train kept a rolling, mr tyler is comparable to mick and i love them both, guitars are good in both bands too, it was awesome seeing aerosmith in an ice rink when toys was coming out, why do most greatest hits of the band exclude this wonderful song ?"
2,Yada Yada Yawn,"This album from the ""Boys from Boston"" makes you realize that---these guys are no longer boys. This band defined my own and my friend's youth. We grew up with them and related to them. That makes it all the sadder to see them continue to lurch forward at this stage. I used to attempt to defend (10 years ago) the band when someone would say 'I am so tired of Aerosmith', but they are no longer defendable.Give them some slack. Do you expect to be doing in 30 years what you are doing today? Why should we expect a band to do so. The problem is, they are harder to relate to now.Aerosmith are no longer the 'high school losers' as they sang in those days. They ARE rich though. S.O.S Too Bad."
5,Buy This Product,This is a fantastic touch up for your car interior. Be sure to combine it with the deglaser to make sure the application works most successfully. This made my near pristine classic look tremendous.
5,Now I have the boots that I wanted all along,"Last season I picked up a great deal on motorcycle boots, but there was one drawback. In order to get the ones in my size, I needed to purchase the ones that were BLUE and Black. I had wanted Black on Black, but they were sold out. Thanks to Fiebings Leather Dye, I now have the color that I wanted from the very start ! I used acetone nail polish remover to deglaze the boots and then gave them three nice coats of Fiebings Leather Dye. I used a stiff art brush that had a 1/2"" bristle which allowed me to work the dye into the leather around the hard plastic protective areas that the boots are made with. I then finished them up with a layer of Kiwi black shoe polish and they look brand new; and also as if they were Black all along."
4,Fiebings Leather dye,"I got this for a couple of pairs of nubuck sandals that had too many colors going on ,gave them a new chance at life. I will definately recommend this brand.I would of gave it 5 stars but they didnt sell any bigger containers then the 4oz."
1,Not really black...,"I tried the dye on 2 black leathers coats, following the directions as specified. Thank goodness I did only a small area as the dye is actually lighter than the black leather. Very disappointed. These are good leather coats, one from Italy and now they are worse than before. The dye looks really black in the bottle but does not end up that way."
5,Great Product!!!!,This product meet the requirements of leatherworkers and hobbiest. It does a very good job with very little prodcut used.
3,Did the trick.,"I don't really have much to compare this dye to but it did the trick. I bought this to refresh a favorite, but old, leather coat that had a few scratches and was worn around the sleeves. The dye matched well so I was thrilled that I didn't have to dye the whole coat. The instructions warned that sometimes the dye would take on a coppery cast. Well, they were right. Everywhere the dye touched, it was coppery. They recommended a product of theirs to remove the cast but I used mink oil and it worked (with a LOT of elbow grease). I would probably do it again but wouldn't look forward to it."
1,didn't liked it,"i tried to use it on a car seat.it looks like the dye is pretty strong and won't fade away easily.how ever, the black dye has a purpleish color to it when in the light.it looks more like ink then a dye."
3,"Great product, POOR Packaging","This is a excellent product and works wonderfully. However the bottle that it comes in is very flimsy and only slight pressure while opening will lead to it spilling over...believe me I found out the hard way. I contacted Fieblings on 2 separate occassions to inform the of this, providing pictures of my work space that is now dyed stained but sadly I never heard back? I would have rated it five stars were it not for the packaging and lack of customer service from fieblings."
5,Great Product,I found Fiebings Leather Dye & Sealer 15 years ago. I used it on a leather piece of furniture that today still looks great. I'v used the dye on other items with the same great results. I just used it on a coach white purse that I needed in black. It came out wonderful. No one realized I dyed it. I would recommend this product.
1,Rubbed off. Not permanent.,"It looks like I'm the contrarian since the other reviews are so good for this dye. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but it was just not permanent. I followed directions, planning to apply it to a worn cushion on my leather sofa. But first I did a test spot. I cleaned the area with alcohol spirits, let it dry, and applied two coats of dye. When I rubbed a white cloth on the test area, a lot of dye came off. Then I applied leather conditioner and waited a day to let it sit, and tested again. The product still wipes off. I noticed some people say the product is hard to get off of skin. For me, a couple brisk hand washings took a spot off of my finger, so again, maybe I got a bad bottle. The LESSON FOR OTHERS - TEST BEFORE YOU USE IT."
5,Satisfied!,"I got this set for $300 on amazon. Make sure you have optical cables, as this one does not come with any. I am ordering speaker stands as well. Great dvd player too! Nice to have a 5 disk changer with 1080i output."
2,Cant hear it!,"I just got the system, i connected it (i didnt like the connections of the speakers to the reciever, but what the hell..), and gues what i could only get like 100 watts of output i got the maximum volume and it would be right perfect for watching a movie, when it shouldnt it should be extremely hard at the maximum volume. I own a bose companion III for my computer and it would sound much more higher than this crap. i should have gone afther the bose."
3,"Overall, pretty comprehensive system","For the most part, this system does what it says it will do for a reasonable price. Set up is a little complicated, but just thumb through the manual(s).Only complaint is that in order to utilize the DMP(Digital Media Port) you have to buy a $100 docking station from Sony that is ONLY compatible with (taken from an email from Sony Support):We are glad to assist you with your query regarding the compatibility of the iPods with your Sony Cradle for iPod. The iPods that are compatible with the Sony TDMIP1 are as follows:1. iPod nano 2nd generation2. iPod 5th generation3. iPod nano 1st generation4. iPod 4th generation (Color Display)5. iPod 4th generation6. iPod MiniOf course, I only own an iPod Touch, so I am SOL (Soooooo out of luck)and apparently is anyone who has purchased an iPod in the last year or so."
3,As expected,I always enjoyed him on the Midnight Special. He makes no apologies for his rock and roll behavior. It's a slow read but an okay one.
5,Interesting Exploration of More Advanced Flash Features,"I am giving this book a five star review because it has some interesting content, and the author gives the material an original spin. The chapters on Flash 3D, XML, and Swift-Generator were very helpful and dare I say, sometimes insightful. In contrast, I wasn't that excited about the chapters on PHP and MySQL, but by the end, they proved interesting. My biggest problem with the book is its overall lack of organization, and personally, many of the chapters would have been helped by more examples. Bottom line - this is not a cover-to-cover read, but if you want interesting content on some of Flash 5's more advanced features, I would pick it up."
1,"RC, possibly the greatest rider ever","i purchased this book to read about 1 of the greatest racers in MX history. what i got was a book that is little more than a copy of some of the bio from racing programs. a grand total of 31 pages including the index and glossary. i am sure the info is accurate, but this book contains absolutely nothing that a fan of Ricky Carmichael hadnt already seen many times before. definately was not what i expected it to be. go to the book store and buy 2-3 MX magazines, you will learn a lot more about Carmichael there. dont waste the money on this book."
3,Ricky Carmichael: Motocross Champion (Edge book),I had assumed the book would have more pages/content for $20 or so. This book is for young people. I believe it should be easier to find the number of pages in a book before ordering. What is there is fine.
4,"Small Book, Big Thoughts","This book sketches a connection between quantom theory and biology. It attempts to show how the quantum nature of things can result in a DNA molecule. I think it does a nice job and achieves its purpose.The earlier reviewers make the book sound like it's almost beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals. I'm an ordinary mortal and I felt like I got the big ideas with no trouble. If you're a philosopher or physicist, maybe you would appreciate whatever subtleties are here, but an ordinary, interested, technically-oriented layperson should not think that this book is inaccessible. This book is very accessible.Four stars instead of five because I think Mr. Schrodinger waxes a bit too ""intuitive"" once he departs from the scientific approach to things."
4,A Good try by Schroedinger,"This book shows how a real genius works and thinks, not just Physics but all dimensions of the science. In this book, although Schroedinger claims that he is not an expert in this field of Science he is certainly playing humble. He starts with the question, Why human beings have to be so big relative to Atoms, continues with Statistical concepts of Quantum Theory and than comes to the conclusion that the Genes really does not obey to statistical rules and therefore the life is stable and mutations are rare. In the second half of the book he goes into Philosophy and covers Mind and Matter. In the beginning he states that ""The world is a construct of our sensations, perceptions, memories"" I found this very interesting. Schroedinger provides very nice interpretation of entropy Concept and Statistical formulas."
2,Not bad for a book I had to read for class...,"I was supposed to read this book for one of my classes, and it was a quick and easy read. But had it not been for this class, I don't think I would've ever read it."
3,"A physicist's essay on a topic he cannot know as a scientist, only as a human being","I'm wondering why scientists are allowed to give their opinion as scientists about topics they know nothing about as scientists. The beginning of the title (""What is Life"") sounds like if Schrodinger can claim anything about the difference between mind and matter as a pure consequence of physics. Too bad, as the rest of the title might make you think that there will be some discussion about why and whether there might be a difference between mind and matter. What remains of mind when you stick to the physics? That would be a very nice question to think about, if only this was the topic of the book...but it's not what is done here."
2,Not very helpful..,"I can't figure out why this book got so many great reviews. It is very general and vague, and its contents could have been written after a single general education course in business. This book may be better for people who have no idea whatsoever how to start their own business and need help identifying the entrepeneurial spirit. But those with a true entrepeneurial spirit have probably already taken the steps to explore and gather information that exceed the contents of this book.My opinion is that this book is generally more for high school kids or those who have no exposure to entrepenuers in their daily life. It is definitely not worthy of the Harvard logo."
1,Worst business book ever - even when I got it as a gift.,"I'm so embarrassed my friend gave me this book as a gift as I get ready to launch my own company that I want to return his money. This book is written like a term paper by an inexperienced student who leveraged the Harvard name. It was a worthless waste of my time to even scan it.Instead I would recommend the book by the founder of Subway - Start Small, Finish Big: 15 Key Lessons to Start--and Run--Your Own Successful Business by Fred DeLuca, John P. Hayes."
1,Decent at first but that's about it.,"I'm going to be brief. For the cost, they're okay headphones at first. The ""headband"" is a little irritating at first, but you can grow to ignore it. The volume control is a nice feature for quickly turning down the music when a coworker complains. However, the problem lies in it's durability. After approximately 3 months, the volume control casing split in two, exposing the small board and wires inside. Promptly giving it a quick fix (super glue), it worked fine again. Another month or so after that, the wires on the inside of the cable started to split, causing nasty scratches in the music that continued to get worse, and worse, and worse. Now, this was in an office environment, not getting bumped around while jogging, flung around by kids, or getting eaten by the dog. Normal wear and tear.I would buy these again if my other option was sticking my arm in a woodchipper, but that's about it."
1,Thumbs Down,"Comfort is okay, but the audio is terrible. Even if I have my pc audio options maxed out, along with the volume control on the headphones, the sound is still very low. ."
3,I don't know what this book is supposed to be,"I've enjoyed other books co-authored by Garfinkel, but I just don't know what to make of this one.The Infosec world tends to be characterized by Chicken Littles who are able to attract attention by claiming that the sky is falling down. This book is filled with sky falling down examples--some of which undoubtedly will come to pass. But I don't believe that most of them will. Just because something can go wrong, doesn't mean that it will, and this book is filled with wild speculation.This book should really appeal to the paranoid and the conspiracy theorist, but I don't believe that it really provides much guidance in what is realistically going to take place.It wasn't a bad read--the words are pleasantly arranged. But most of the scenarios in this book are just not credible to me, and the research is non-existent. Its an opinion piece, and I think most of the opinions are wrong.Does not live up to its jacket cover."
2,Unrelenting Pessimism,"In Database Nation, Simson Garfinkel uses Orwellian prose and dark prophecies to dramatize an important but dry subject (how much the government should regulate the use of medical records and consumer purchasing records). Garfinkel portrays our world as a hopeless technical dystopia where insurance companies rip you off, telemarketers bother you at dinnertime, terrorists run free and the average person is powerless to do anything about it.The book's unrelenting pessimism makes it unbalanced and ultimately hurts the author's credibility. For example, instead of giving a nod to the progress being made by pro-privacy agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the state Consumer Protection Boards, Garfinkel dwells on abuses by the FBI and ""faceless"" corporations.I'd skip this one unless you need another reason to be mad at insurance companies."
2,JUST LEAVE!,"I had more respect for her first cd because she steped away from the whole Destiny Child/Beyonce sound, now she's back with a whole cd of watered down DC tracks. I'm hoping she wakes up to the fact that Beyonce is the star of the bunch and she will never get any shine as long as she stays with her parents company. It's not personal, it's about business she needs to take notes from Latoya and LEAVE!"
1,sorry never liked kelly,"she'll al,ways be second banana to beyonce I'll tolerate the track gangster only because snoop dogg's on it other than that pass."
4,Simply Deeper,"Well, after having this CD for a year I can now appreciate Kelly's sophomore album for what it's worth. The quality and the craftsmanship are there however; it just lacks the proper promotion which is fine in my book. Everyone is not meant for mainstream status and I have learned that some of the best albums are not billboard chart toppers. I have followed Kelly's career very closely for the last 10 years and watch her go from Beyonce backup to her own woman. While Kelly's debut solo album Simple deep was not deep enough, Miss Kelly is a much better attempt.Stand out tracks includeLike this ft EveGhetto ft SnoopFlashbackEvery thought is youThe show ft TankStill in love with my exLove (by far one of her best tracks written by Solange)Better without you (another excellent track well crafted)Overall I give the CD a B-"
4,Good CD,"I think the cd deserves way more credit than it is getting.The CD does take a few listens, but then you will see that she has some really good tracks that can be placed on repeat. Like This...Im over it! This is Love...Im gonna walk down the aisle to this one day!!! Still in love with my ex.... LOVE IT!!! I cant relate directly, but can understand how someone could feel like that!!! Ghetto...GARBAGE!! Love... Good listen and very relateable!!! Work...OK! Comeback...Thats what I got ... so hey I feel her!! Better without you...OK!! The Show... Nice job!!! Overall I like the CD GREAT job Ms. Kelly!!! I Love B.....and now I love Ms. Kelly too!!! where you at Michelle?????"
4,A great album but this premium edition is a bit disappointing,"Kelly Rowland has made a great sophmore album but I find this premium edition a bit disappointing. In my opinion, a better song for the digital download would have been nice. the bonus download is just ""Like This"" DJ Speedy Remix with Eve and YoungBloodZ's Sean Paul. I was hoping for ""Gotsta Go"" Featuring Da Brat, which appears on International editions of the album. Anyways, unless you want the lyrics, extra photos, cell phone ringtone and wall-paper and the ""like this"" remix download, I find this premium edition a waste of money. But this is still a great album in general."
2,WHAT DA.....Kelly???,Oh my God. I was so ready for this album and I was so disappointed. This was not as good as I had hoped...it was nothing that I has expected. I had high hopes for this album after I heard the first single. My hopes are now destroyed. I dont know what to say because Kelly is better than this album. She could've done far better than she did. I enjoyed LeToya album better than Kelly's. It seemed as though Kelly tries the Destiny Child sound without the other girls...and that was not a good idea. Kelly please come up with your own sound and leave Destiny Child alone. I commend LeToya she had her own sound and the album was great. I see why Beyonce came out with her album when LeToya came out with hers. If Kelly would've come out with LeToya...Kelly would've been out shined. I gave Kelly 2 stars only because her single with my girl Eve. Sorry but thats my opinion.
3,Its better than the first CD,"I must say when I heard ""Like This"".. I just knew the cd was gonna be HOT!!. I freak n loved the song. So I couldn't wait till the CD came out. The excitement went away after listening to the cd. Now I will say ""The Show"" was a hot song not sure why it wasn't released as a single but it was way better than ""Ghetto"" however I do like ""Ghetto"", the only other song that stuck out at me was ""LOVE"" was feelin the beat and everything but the hook was so ugly but I still like the song."
3,Yet Another...,"This album was okay, not what I had hoped. The songs are ones I'd find on any other R&B singer's album, such as Brandy's, Monica's & Amerie's. I appreciated Kelly most at the time when she released ""Stole"", which was something no R&B singer had released at the time, and it made her stand out, also with a positive message."
4,Why Isn't Kelly Rowland a Superstar?,"I've given this CD a listen, and I am gobsmacked. I can't understand why Kelly Rowland doesn't have more of a superstar's career.Granted, the beats are a tad reheated and Kelly sounds a bit like she's trying to imitate Beyonce in places. However, her vocal gifts have clearly been underestimated by the music press and DC fans.I digress, back to the CD. It's a wonderful baby step forward for a singer who has the potential to be a great artist with the right guidance, songs, production and so on. The CD, Ms. Kelly, boasts a self-assured Kelly, front and center stage, where she belongs. The songs have memorable melodies, and some rather good beats. My only criticism, besides what I've mentioned already, is that there are a few too many ballads for my taste.Stand out tracks include: Love, Ghetto, and Like This.This album won't change your life, or bend your mind, but it's a good listen while you wait for Ms. Kelly to drop a CD that does change your life."
1,not good condition,"I liked the music, but the product condition was not good. I hear noise and it made my laptop crash. I thought my laptop was the problem...."
4,for the sake of Clarity and Conciseness,"This is a highly useful dictionary. Although its entries total to just over 100 pages, it is remarkably complete. Prince offers short, to the point explanations of terms that in other dictionaries are notoriously fuzzy explained. Moreover, he provides a very helpful set of crossreferences that goes with each entry, thus enabling the reader to find out more. Among the outstanding explanations is the description of point-of-view, in which Prince sets forth the proposals of Friedman, Genette and Stanzel complete in just two pages. Useful bibliographical references substitute for the fact that Prince could not adress every controversial discussion in full. Everyone interested in literary theory should own a copy, even if the work was not updated to take aboard recent developments."
1,Teach yourself how not to waste money on worthless books.,"Not only did I waste money on this worthless book, I wasted a fortune on trying to sell my home using the advise of this guy. By the time I'm done, what little profit I made will surely go to my attorney to keep the buyers of my home off my back."
5,Just another reason why Thomas Hardy is such a perfectionist,"Beautifully written, Thomas Hardy goes all out to make the reader see, hear, and smell every scene in this book. From begining to end, you never know what's going to happen next, and just when you think the story is calming down, Hardy throws a swerve your way. Great surprises, not predictable at all.Hardy perhaps one of the better describers of setting of his time, shows once again, why books were so highly read back in his age.Thomas once again delivered another great book of sadness, happiness, pregnancy and marriage. Although the story is mostly sad, it is still a great book, especially for those who have read previous Hardy books. A great read."
2,A Benchwarmer,"It pains me to give one of my favorite authors less than four...-ish stars, but I really feel as if Two on a Tower is not that great. As someone coming from a scientific/engineering background, I did of course get giddy with excitement upon seeing Mr. Hardy discuss the beauties of the sciences and people's relations to them, and as far quotable quotes, Two on a Tower ranks among the best of Hardy's oeuvre. You also have the whole questioning attitude towards marriage/relationships similar to Jude the Obscure coming out of this like you do. But this book is no Jude the Obscure. It felt more draggy and dull...sort of like an episode of Happy Days after the series lost its stride. (And yes Happy Days did have a pretty nice stride there for a while). I don't know, keep Two on a Tower on the bench until you've exhausted most of the rest of Team Hardy, which for me has a starting lineup of Tess, Jude, Madding Crowd, the Native (slight Return), and the Mayor of Casterbridge.Yay"
4,Writing Exceeds Story,"The language of Hardy is exceptional. His understanding of love and its motivations is too. If anyone else would have written this story, it would be worthless. Since he did, it's worth reading, though slow the first seventy-five pages and the ending is unexpected and unnecessary. I strongly suggest reading Wolf's Revolution for a story of this kind.Revolution"
5,Flying high!,"I would just like to add to the justful Amazon review that the absolute highlight of this recording is the last cut ""Modern Day Tuba"": Bob Mintzer's solo together with Peter Erskine's unbelievably DYNAMIC AND DRIVING DRUMMING (another milestone in his career) is worth the price of this CD alone."
4,"Starclub, more like FANTASTIC CLUB!","This is one of the all-time great pop/rock albums to ever come out in 1993 by 4-piece band as a self-titled ablum under Island Records with a ""club"" symbol on the front.And ain't nobody gonna say differently! For those of you who have reviewed this album and gave it a poor rating, you aren't listening to it in context!"
2,"One great song, a lotta filler","Are the '60's back? This band would like to think so. Not only because theytake their name from that fabled '60's club that hosted the nascent Beatles.The psychadelic guitars and harmonies that grace the opening track ""Hard toGet""--a great track worthy of any of their models--are also a dead giveaway.Unfortunately, the rest of the album isn't nearly as good. There's a lot offiller, even if it's reasonably listenable filler. They took that from the'60's, too, but no one should look to Gary Lewis and the Playboys and theirilk for inspiration."
1,One hit and much filler,"Robin Wilson of the Gin Blossoms speaks highly of this album and on his recommendation I did get a copy of Starclub's S/T album. Appently, he must have heard something more than what I heard. After Hard To Get, the single off this album, there is nothing more on this album that I would want to hear again. And perhaps the rest of the CD buying public had the same opinion that I did, cause that I have seen a lot of this CD in the cut out bins and at the thrift shops all over here. In fact, the CD that I used to have I traded it in at the thrift shop. One year later, it's still there. Better to find Hard To Get on a CD single or wait till it shows up in a Pop Rock complation. Grade C minus"
4,Music To Get You Going,"I first heard starclub's music in a movie. Most of what I listen to and own is from movies. I really liked the song and the other songs too. I recomend it to anyone that want to chill out after work! The first song 'hard to get' was featured in the movie ""The Crush"" starring Alicia Silverstone and Cary Elwes. So if you are thinking of buying it but you're not sure, just listen to it in the movie. That's what i would do. Most of the greatest music is in the movies anyway."
5,Very useful tool,We bought this to trim smaller trees and tall bushes. It works very well and seems very durable. We are glad we bought it.
4,Easy on tree,I like the Pruning Stik. It does not break brittle adjacent branches as my previous tree pruner does. It is easy to use. I don't know about durability yet.
1,Poor quality,"Pruner was prepackaged in two pieces, sent broken with aluminum/metal sheered into at the base where it retracks into the black handle. The aluminum/metal portion needs to be of a higher quality and sturdy to withstand any strain and bend or break especially for the job its to be used for."
1,pretty but worthless after a few uses,"This prunner has some nifty design features but fails in moderatly heavy use in a garden stting...by heavy use I mean using it for what it was intended for. It dosn't cut hard limbs, the tension spring breaks away...mine flew off and disappered forever under piles of mulch, the saws' okay bt I lost a screw that holds it...after using it for bout three days I'm going to take mine back."
1,Not Worth It,The saw blade attaches to the plastic head via a machine screw/wing nut and a plastic stud molded onto the head. When the plastic stud shears off you will be left with a floppy saw extremely difficult to work with
4,Life made easier,"The cutters on the pruning stick are great. Easy to use and works very well. The one fault I have with the Stik is that when you attach the saw blade to prune larger branches, the telescoping pole moves up and down while trying to saw. I have atempted to tighten the nut, but the pole continues to try and move each time you try to saw. Other than that its a great tool, made well and makes pruning an easy task."
5,Fiskars Telescoping Pruning Stik,It's so easy to use while sitting on my John Deere Lawn Tractor. It's better than all the rest. Highly Recommended.
5,Exceeded my expectations,My Fiskars telescopic pruner is easy to use and paid for itself the first day I used it! By being able to quickly prune off the seed pods of my parasol trees I won't spend a lot of time next year pulling unwanted seedlings. But it was the saw attachment which amazed me. It is incredibly sharp! I'm sort of afraid of it (ha). I was able to saw through three-inch live oak limbs with true ease. I couldn't believe how quickly it made short work of that incredibly tough wood. It would have cost me a couple hundred dollars to pay someone else to do these jobs for me.
5,Great tool,"Works like a charm. Turned a hazardous job off a ladder to a easy fast job. Glad I got the 12 foot one as even "" little"" trees get big once you are next to them. didn't even read the directions unit was ready & so easy to use"
5,Better than I hoped...,"Okay, I'm really not a tool geek. But I have to admit, I did open the box as soon as it arrived and went out back to trim a branch that towered over my head. I was really surprised! Not only does it work, but it DOES cut branches like a hot knife through butter. I mean, it really felt like that. Who knew? Anyway, despite my weird-sounding hype, it does work great, and will make a nice addition to my suburban tool collection."
1,broken,I don't really know how well this tool functions yet. It arrived broken. I have been working with the manufacturer on repair/replacement for well over 2 weeks. Repair part is supposed to be on the way. I will have to make the repair once the part arrives. If what I am experiencing appeals to you buy it otherwise be careful.
2,Three times a charm they say....hopefully,"First one got lost in transit, reordered another, both showed up on same day. One was sent back, the one I kept broke on the first day of use. Amazon reordered another one that I just received this week so the jury is still out on how well it will do. I am hopeful that this one will be OK. I will update when I actually put it to use. Next time I will just buy something like this from Lowe's or Home Depot. Not sure what possessed me to buy this type of product through Amazon, pure laziness I guess!"
5,"Cool Pruning Tool -- Light Weight, Versatile","This tool is sharp, extensible to 13 feet, and light weight. Plus it comes with an attachable saw. The head is adjustable to allow a wide variety of cutting angles. I cut some branches about 1 1/4 inch in diameter and it did pretty well. It extends easily, and the mechanism for closing the cutting jaws is very convenient. I highly recommend it."
4,Gotta love it,"A very useful tool. Plenty of adjustabity for length as well as cutter rotation. Allows user to access obscure branches easily. Light weight to reduce fatigue yet strong design, but care should be taken as to not bind or stress plastic cutter head. Awesome saw also; just a couple of strokes for a 1"" limb. A must have for the arborist homeowner. Four stars for the same reason that nobody gets a 10 except Jesus."
5,Great Product,"After it arrived, I went right out and trimmed a few trees. Amazing how easy it was to use and how effective it was."
1,When?,I'd review this if it would ever ship. Now a month after the order and no goods. Don't believe the 1-2 weeks.
2,A little too much plastic,Nice enough pruner as long as it is not stressed. I broke it twice after only a few days of heavy use. One time at the plastic section near the cutter and another time at the plastic mount for the blade. The best thing is Fiskars has a lifetime warranty that they honor - If you dont mind waiting a month.
1,Defective Product - Fiskars will not respond,"I have purchased other fiskars products in the past and was always impressed with the quality. The telescoping pruning stik, however, has been a big dissappiontment. The upper portion of the telescoping handle slips out of the bottom portion before the saw can bite. I felt the allen scres holding the locking lever were loose, but tightening results in no real change. I have attempted to contact Fiskars with no luck."
1,Nice design but not durable,"Most home improvement stores no longer carry this product for a reason. Yes, the design is attractive and the tool is user-friendly, like other Fiskars products, but this is not a heavy-duty tool and it will not last. I quickly damaged the saw blade, and found this is hard to replace. After a few more uses, the bypass pruner broke. The failure was at the hinge, which has a plastic joint. In attempting to prune a branch that fit into the jaw (which it should therefore be able to cut), the force of the cut made the metal blade come off this joint and damage the joint in the process. My recommendation is therefore to look for a pruner with all-metal construction and easy to find replacement blades. I replaced mine with a Corona, which is heavier, but appropriately heavier duty."
3,"Fine, but don't stress it","Product worked well on small, lives branches. The light weight is a real plus. However, in attempting to cut 1 inch thick dead wood (pecan), something broke in the sealed head and the unit cannot be repaired. I will probably get a replacement unless I can find another brand as light, and just avoid trying to cut dead wood."
4,Fiskars telescoping pruning stik,"Since we have several high bushes to trim each year, we needed a cutting devise that would help to do the difficult tasks.Now that we have the new Fiskars telescoping pruning stik, most high bush trimming is done without too much difficuly. We are happy to have purchased this tool."
5,Trims branches with ease and no more tangled mess!,"I bought this thing quite a while back in 2009 and to this day it's working like a champ. The best features of this is the ability to turn the cutting head and not having a long rope that gets tangled around.It does cut like butter as some say and I believe that's due to two things: The sharpness of the blade and the design of the cutting mechanism which is chain controlled.I am also in my late sixties and until I bought this thing had been struggling with using the rope system, and a pulling mechanism which left my hand sore from trying to pull on the rope. Being on a 10 foot ladder and trying to fight a heavy pruner and a tangled rope can be quite an adventure for an old dude like me. To an old person, 10' is long way to fall!My only one wish is that it was longer, but then again that would be a never ending complaint as we try to cut higher and higher branches. At some point, the thing would get too long and too heavy."
4,FISKARS TELESCOPING PRUNER,"tHE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IS WELL MADE, BUT IT ISN'T 13 FEET IN LENGTH, IT IS ONLY A COUPLE INCHES OVER 12 FEET. AND IT WON'T CUT 1 INCH AND 1/2 LIMBS SINCE THE CUTTING JAWS ONLY OPEN TO 1 INCH. BUT I'LL JUST MOVE UP ONE STEP ON MY LADDER!!"
2,NOT for exam 70-222,"Cover: For Exam 70-222 No Longer AppliesThe front cover, spine, and back cover of this Training Kit imply that the Training Kit is geared toward the MCP Exam 70-222, however this no longer applies due to the changes in the objectives for this exam.Exam 70-222 is still in development and will be released in its beta version by July 2000. Because the objectives for the exam were not yet finalized when this Training Kit was first published, the Training Kit does not map exactly to this exam, nor to the direction this exam is taking in its development.Since the exam objectives have changed, please disregard the references on the cover."
4,Scary fun and silly Italian style campy zombie flick ... what's not to love?,"This has got everything you want from a zombie flick and more -- it looks great, it's very funny, a little bit sexy, and over the top insane. A man with few prospects in life and little hope takes a job at a cemetery where the dead come back to life. His job is to make sure they stay buried, and he's good at it until he falls in love with the beautiful widow of his latest patron, and his Igor-like assistant falls in love with the dead daughter of the town mayor. Then mayhem and absurdity run wild until the film ends on a bizarre (and not entirely satisfying) twist. Filmed in a style that recalls that of the great Italian horror maestros like Argento and Bava, but hilarious and over the top crazy. All in all, it's a fun ride for those who think they've seen every twist on the zombie genre -- this one has something different for you."
2,Bury this one!,This movie received a lot of great reviews but for some reason I have no Ideal why. I has a good story line with the guy who has to live in the cemetery to battle the dead that soon come back to life after being buried but other than that the story goes no where. The lead character finds himself falling in love with a recent widow who was married to a older man but really did love him so she visits everyday. You can see where this goes he falls for the girl and so on. This movie just did not do anything scary or really that gory. It was like a love story with Zombies. How boring is that. why so many people like this film is beyond me. Give me a George Romero film any day over this bore. I fell for all the hype and bought it thinking this is a can't miss. Well it miss big time. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. Do not buy the HYPE!
3,Cemetery Man,"This movie started out amazing. I absolutley loved the 1st 15 minutes. The rest of the movie was kind of blah, but i admit that over the years it does grow on you."
3,"A little bit cheesy, but...","The effects in this movie left something to be desired. Fortunately, the stars are gorgeous which makes up for whatever it's lacking.Over all, it's a fun watch. I mean, how many other movies have Rupert Everett living in a cemetary?"
1,No.,"This movie makes no sense.The title character is introduced as an immoral zombie-killer, who picks up grieving trophy wife bimbos at the cemetery where he works. Later he transitions into a blubbery psychotic mess over the loss of a chick he knew for two days and didn't even seal the deal with. Only to meet multiples of her, one of whom has a phobia of erections...If you LOVE zombie movies, stay away. The makeup is terrible, the acting is mediocre, plot? What plot? The zombie action is boring. There's no connection with any of the characters and you spend the last 3/4 of the movie hoping everyone dies."
5,Cemetary Man,"This film will ALWAYS be a classic for me. Being an indy film maker myself, I really appreciate the attention to detail with the art side of the flick, but it's not too overbearing. It's gory and has all the elements of a good zombie/horror movie. Continual, unending twists and turns for our hero makes your heart ache.If you haven't seen this movie. Get out from under your rock and DO SO!"
1,This movie could have put me in the cemetery!,"I watched this movie a couple days ago, and oh my god, what a snooze fest. I swear to god it was like eight hours long. It is the most boring, mind numbing peice of work that I have ever seen in my life. The plot dragged on forever, and there were so many points in the movie that you thought was the end....but then it kept on going. Even being drunk doesn't make this movie any better. I for one don't understand the good reviews, I think this movie is terrible. Rupert was better in My Best Friends Wedding, than in this pile. Oh, and the make-up and costumes, sucked!"
1,Remrkably bad,"Given a number of positive reviews I was expecting more from this one. I quite enjoy a 'bad' movie from time to time, but this one is dumb as ditch water...Do yourself a favour - ignore it"
1,Terrible movie,"This was a total waste of 90 minutes of my life. Terrible, boring, stupid, and senseless don't begin to describe this waste of film. How anyone can rate it 4 or 5 starts is beyond me. I think I'm open minded. I watch horror, slasher, foreign and suspense films all the time. This has nothing going for it. It is NOT scary in the least. And the special effects are about as well done as a high school play. This is just garbage. I would have given it zero stars, but that's not an option."
2,What???????,"This is one of the stupidiest, silly, boring, juvenile movie I hase ever seen. Terrible."
5,AWESOME FLICK,Cemetary Man is one of the best movies ever. I recomend this movie to everyone. Although its hard to find this movie is definetly one to add to your collection!
5,"Not a ""Zombie Movie""","If you're looking for a Lucio Fulci-ish zombie movie, try elsewhere. If you would enjoy an extremely dark comedy with some zombies in it, watch this. One of my all-time favorites, this movie has so many layers, you will need to watch it several times to appreciate it. Votes of people downrating this film because it wasn't the typical zombie movie they were hoping for need to be deducted from the average."
2,schlitz,"this movie is boring tripe. except for the sex scene in the graveyard. Still tripe but not boring. lets say what were two become three. Somewhat humourous. This film has a better than average budget for movies of this genre and its all wasted!Its not scary, gory or entertaining. Did i mention it was B.O.R.I.N.G? Overall, i found this film to be overated. what more can i say? don't believe the hype."
1,A stinker,"Perhaps if you have low expectations - really low - you'll be able to stomach this spectacular dud. Perhaps your interest in Italian horror can sustain you throughout 80 minutes of plot-free, stylistically void, unfunny, bland performances in this schmaltzy horror flick.Bride of Chucky is probably more coherent and frightening. If it's horror your after, check out the Evil Deads. If it's zombies your after, check out George Romero's films. If it's Rupert Everett, check out An Ideal Husband.Avoid this clunker!"
1,A must-not see,"This is truly one of the worst supposed-zombie films ever made, with the zombies being few and far between. It was very difficult to watch because there was nothing to expect or look forward to seeing.The actors' and actresses' skills vary from tolerable to really bad. The story line is just wacky but not in the humorous sense. I could not wait for the film to be over. I would not recommend this movie especially if you like horror films or zombie flicks."
1,Don't even steal this movie!!!,"This tripe was horrible. The only reason i gave it 1 star is because of the bus wreck that was very gory. Besides that, and when the boy scout zombies attack, I fast forwarded thru the entire movie. Even the nudity was horrible. If all other movies on earth are destroyed and TV is abolished, you should STILL not watch this film!!!!!"
1,Awful...god awful...,"Perhaps all the people giving this movie positive reviews are friends or relatives of the director. However, I consider this film to be one of the worse films of all time, if not THE worst. Please watch it so that you can set the bar for how bad a movie can be. Even Flubber looks good compared to this. Not even Anna Falchi getting her goods out for the guys can save this movie. Just plain awful. I'd give it no stars but it won't let me."
4,A fairly unknown classic,"This movie belongs on the top-tier with other horror-comedy flicks like the Evil Dead trilogy, Dead-Alive and Bad Taste. See! Rupert Everett before he goes to Hollywood! See! One of the hottest women (Anna Falchi) to ever hit the screen! See! An incredibly quirky, yet meaningful, zombie flick! Cinematography, acting and special FX wise, this movie is about on par with the movies I listed above. The DVD took so long due to legal reasons, but this movie should have been a bigger hit (at least a cult hit) back in the day."
5,The Best and most underappreciated Horror film of the decade,"Sigh . . . if only this film had been the start of a trend, horror films might have had some place to go. But then, it's a singular vision which cannot be duplicated. Michele Soavi, the director, contributed in various ways to many of Dario Argento's films but DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE leaves those (mostly) empty exercises in style and atmosphere far behind. The student has exceeded the teacher, creating a modern masterpiece that uses horror imagery to explore much weightier territory. A wonderful film that will someday be found and appreciated by a wider audience."
4,"Stylishly bent, you'll love it!","Beautifully shot and howlingly funny, CEMETERY MAN exposes the talents of Italian horror movies. Rupert Everett plays a gravedigger who discovers that zombies are invading the town. Originally titled DELLAMORTE, DELLAMORE (OF LOVE, OF DEATH) but the Americans found that title too wimpy so they called it CEMETERY MAN."
2,Not recommend for kindle,I like the book but the formatting and editing is terrible. Some of the words are separated in the middle. Some lines repeat themselve or don't make sense. Don't waste your money on the kindle version. I can overlook a few mistakes but not this many.
4,Inspirational and Uplifting,"This book makes a great gift for the women in your life such as friends, sisters, mother, etc... The stories in the book are inspiring and uplifting. I purchased it for a friend of mine, and she really enjoyed it and has since passed it on to a friend of hers. If you are looking for an uplifting gift book, Miracles For Women is a great choice."
4,Powerful Message.........,"'Six' is doubtless a powerful movie, the message will of course always be so, namely that Jesus Christ is the only answer and refuge from the coming society where oppression and control attempt to stifle freedom of thought, and where a brutal crackdown on 'deviants' ( i.e Christians) will be commonplace.My only reservation on the film which boasts a good use of Scripture and some believable scenarios, is the lack of production spark. There's just a hint of amateur about some sequences, car chases which hardly raise an eyebrow, escape scenes which appear to be little more than a stroll out of a supermarket.The boldness of the believers is well portrayed, as is the power of the Gospel Message to banish fear from even the most severe trials.Note - there are one or two quite unpleasant torture scenes, film is rated 12."
2,More of the same,"Yet another movie that presents the psuedo-gospel of ""get right with God so you don't have to go to hell with all the other sinners"". If you've seen left behind, omega code, etc. This is only different in having a smaller budget, smaller plot, and equally bad acting. Someone please start making movies about the life of fullness and great joy that Jesus invited people to rather than another fire insurance movie like this one. How many do we need? Who are they for? I am sure God can use this for His glory and purposes, but I found it rather dissappointing."
1,sturgeon's law yet again,"dystopia or utopia depends on your point of view, as does a movie or book review. IMO, this is one very Loooooooooooong Marty Stew (the male version of Mary Sue fanfiction)mishmash with plotting and characterization hammered into place by the author rather than a story that flows from the plot and characters. There are a lot of similar and better told stories out there.Try:Revolt in 2100 by R. A. HeinleinIt's about the overthrow of the American Ayatollahs but the point is the superior writing and story telling. There is no difference between secular or religious repression, so the difference is simply in the story telling skill, which Heinlein had and this movie did not."
3,Interesting Look At End Times,"As my title states, this movie presents an interesting interpretation of end time events. The acting isn't great, but the biblical theology is pretty good with a couple of interesting side stories. Probably not one you'd have for your personal library, but worth renting if nothing else is in."
4,Surprisingly good production,"The producers of this film made some very wise choices - instead of trying to make a blockbuster film with their VERY modest budget, they chose instead to focus on the story and leaving what would otherwise have required some serious (and expensive) special effects, to your imagination. This works surprisingly well in this film.The Gospel of Jesus Christ is clearly spelled out, and gives a basically believable look at what the future of this very country (USA) holds if we continue on the path we are on...Thought-provoking, and inspiring."
1,Only if you are Christian ... otherwise ...,"This Movie - if good for you ONLY if you are Christian or a Jesusfan ... otherwise, you might find the movie going to a direction that doesn't suit you.Personally, I didn't enjoy the movie - at all."
2,The end of the world according to Christians,"This movie is an interpretation of Revelations (which was actually a warning against about worshiping emperors such as Nero and Caligula). Stephen Baldwin has a part as an all knowing Christian who not only talks to God but God talks to him. I laughed when he came out of the shadows in a way that screamed ""Look who's a Christian!"". Oh good, a D-list actor ""found"" Jesus. I liked when he got a good beating. God didn't seem to warn him that was coming! And I loved the line a Christian used. ""Your beliefs are irrelevant to the facts"". Duh, yeah, why do you people get mad when I say that?Actually, the acting by these unknown actors isn't bad. Fundies will love it, the rest of us might get a snicker or two out of it."
2,Seriously lacking!,"I love End Time movies. But this is a very boring movie. Save your money, and don't waste your time. This one is'nt worth it."
5,Stephen Baldwin best performance with a Exciting Message,"I was blown away by the performances, the continuity, the realistic sets and, most importantly, the message! While there are scenes that show physical force, it is not as brutal as a Hollywood epic, but necessary to show what one will endure during the Tribulation professing to follow Jesus! This is a Must-See film!Why would anyone NOT make a commitment now! Whenever I have these conversations, I usually add, ""one of us will be right, one will be wrong; but I'd rather be wrong on this side of eternity, than the other"".One of my favorite movies, next to ""Flywheel"" and ""Fireproof""."
4,Six: The Mark Unleashed,"I enjoyed this movie, it was really great. It met my expectations, and I have ordered even more similar movies."
2,6,"Unfortunatley this would have to be one of the poorest Christian movies ever made. With the bevy of so called stars in it, it was terrible, the production was terrible and the acting wasn't any better AVOID!!!!"
4,Good job.,"The movie came on time and was in good condition. It was a good movie. I liked it. I would order similar movies in the future. It was a bit expensive, but I don't order movies that often."
3,Useful Flash,"I bought this to use as a slave flash for a Fuji s6500fd. It works good with this camera - if you make test shots prior to using to get the flash and camera settings right. It is plenty bright for large rooms. I also used on an Olympus E510. It will fire on from the hotshoe, but not TTL. So far I am pleased."
1,continued disappointment,"The author puts forth a ""New view' and changes his story characters so then I didn't get my wish of 'how I would have hoped Soalme's d. turned out.'"
3,CNE 5 Networking Technologies,"Very condensed with regards to what is needed to pass. You will need additional materials beyond what this book has to offer, just to get a better overview of the material. All the material is here but an overview will help digest the condensed format of this CramExam. This book will compliment any good reference materials related to the 632 exam. Good luck! Herb"
1,THE ALBUM THAT ALMOST DESTROYED HELLOWEEN....,"In this album Helloween tried something new, but without a clear direction the album turned out to be a loser, confusing his hard-core fans and gaining almost none new ones."
1,EPIC FAIL !,"This is by far the absolute worst album of their career and it was preceeded by the other worst album of their career "" Pink Bubbles Go Ape"", two back to back atrocities, this one being even worse and not even slightly resembling a metal album. How the band managed to survive this nuclear level catastrophe is a miracle, if it weren't for the strength and solid reputation they garnered on their Kai Hansen era back catalogue, trust me, this would have been the last ever Helloween album. They took the incredible momentum they had garnered on the ""Keepers"" albums and completely squandered it, this was a band on the verge of a big breakout, could have possibly achieved the success of a Metallic/Anthrax/Megadeth, but alas we will never know, they corrected their problems too late, the ""metal"" train had left the station, let this be a cautionary tale to other metal bands."
4,the diffrent side of hellowwen,i have read all the negative reviews about this album but none of it is true. the album has a few heavy songs but most of the other songs sound like progresive metal. you have to listen to this album more than once it will grow on you. the songs are well written and very interesting. mike kiske is in top form even though this is last album with helloween.
2,''Why Helloween Why'',This one is nothing compare with the oder helloween albuns.Chameleon and Pink bubles don't have the real heloween music. I prefere the bands new and old albuns.
3,the last of the great vocals,"This disc features the last recording of Michael Kiske on lead vocals for Helloween. Despite the vastly different styles, the vocals are solid throughout.What a waste to lose him because now Helloween sounds like any other rock band.Wallow in vibrant guitar work of First Time, the undulating, silky vocals in Windmill and the pounding I Believe.Although less quirky than Keys II, a couple of tracks still suffer from excessive effects.Overall, a quality disc and a worthwhile buy to retain the last of Kiske's work with the once-great band."
5,"Ah, The Good Ol' Days","Under-rated album by many, I loved this when I first bought it all those years ago.It had everything I liked about Kiske-era Helloween - catchy tunes, guitar work and of course the amazing vocals from Kiske.It may have lacked some of the speed and 'metal' of previous albums but I didn't care one bit - I enjoyed it, and still do.This is the last album with Kiske at helm who in my book will always be THE voice of Helloween.I couldn't believe my ears when the silky smooth tones of Kiske were discarded for the raspy smoker's voice of Andi Deris.To be perfectly honest I felt like crying - I still do.In my book Helloween died without Kiske's vocal and writing input and I steadily lost interest in the band after that.This re-release is a very nice buy with the extra tracks.My only niggle is on the cover where they have swapped the original album's Helloween logo for a newer version."
2,"No power-metal here, almost no metal at all.","Ah, Chameleon. The end of Kiske's era. Chameleon is more a experimental album than anything else. Helloween did almost everything here (except country and rap!). There's a couple of good sort-of-metal songs: The First Time and Giants. The lyrics had nothing to do with anything that Helloween ever done before, not even with Pink Bubbles...Not a good album to buy, but listen to it once or twice."
1,Just plain bad music...,"After KEEPER II, Kai Hansen left the boat. Helloween suffered a lot of legal contract problems, and became totally dominated by Mr. Greed, Michael Weikath. After a 3 years without recording, came the awful PINK BUBBLES GO NOWHERE (I'm joking, the title is PINK BUBBLES GO APE). Other than the title, this album had a song called HEAVY METAL HAMSTERS.. Unbeliavable. No wonder Kai Hansen left the boat.Sesing they were not able anymore to perform power metal at its best, they decide to go ""eclectic"" and went to places never explored before. Good intention, tragic results... CHAMELEON is thw worst thing Helloween ever produced, it almost destroyed their careers."
1,WHAT WENT WRONG ? CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME !,"AFter the great twin albuns ""KEEPER OF THE SEVEN KEYS"", guitarrist and founder member Kai Hansen left the boat. Best thing he did. After that, Helloween replaced him with Roland Grapow (an excellent guitar player) and released the average ""PINK BUBBLES GO APE"". THen, came this atomic bomb called ""CHAMELEON"", which set the pattern for Helloween future: a band playing only for money, souless, led by ambitious guitarrist Mike Weikath, trying desperately to gain mainstream attention and led without mercy by Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood. This CD contains a lot of horns, keyboards and whatever you can figure it out listening to it. It's one of the greatest waste of time!"
1,FAILURE,"Trying to change the sound and their music to try to innovate is not bad at all. But doing it making lousy music that you can't figure out what they're about, is sad. HELLOWEEN was going through serious troubles at the time ( drummer Ingo was on his way to suicide ). This album was catastrophic to the band's career."
1,The worst Helloween album ever !,"How can someone rate this CD 5 stars?! It almost ended Hellowwen career. The intentions of the band on it are clear and noble: trying to change their sound a little bit, experimenting new things (including horns!), writing different stuff. This was the brainchild of singer Michael Kiske, and the result was terrible, and he left the band after the album.Sometime later, drummer Ingo commited suicide. Listen to it carefully. This CD is no good."
4,"Underrated, still","This album came as no surprise after Pink Bubbles Go Ape, and went further than many people felt necesary. But it was a necesary step in the band's evolution, and the final work of Michael Kiske, who went on a similar path with his solo albums (so if you hate this one, don't bother with those cd's..).It contains many songs with a catchy chorus, a hallmark of Helloween. The slower songs are well balanced with the faster ones, which probably won't be to many metalheads' taste. Their loss.To me there are no weak songs, if any they are the faster ones like First Time.Kiske gives a great performance, proving he's got one of the best voices in the biz, any style, hands down.The next album is once again back to the band's roots, but they needed this one to get stuff out of their system."
4,A different direction - exellent music,"I reviewed this album because I felt that it was getting some undeserved criticisim. True, this album is a departure from the heavy metal that made Helloween famous, but it serves as an excellent introduction to the genre for those that need a more ""pop"" flavor in thier music. This CD shows the band exploring more acoustic sounds (Windmills, I Don't Want to Cry, In the Night, etc.) and even branches into the realm of swing (Crazy Cat). The headbangers amongst us seem to be very narrow minded about what good music is. This album is brilliant. If you only like thrash (which I love) you won't like this CD. But, if you, like me, love metal but love melody more, buy this CD now."
5,"Smooth & funky rock grooves, tastefully done.","From first listen to Soul Patch, you know these guys are special. Obviously not your typical garage band, their diverse sounds and musically complex grooves go down with a spoon full of sugar. Unlike many bands that try too hard to sound ""complex"" and musically sophisticated, Soul Patch does it naturally; it never sounds forced and it never sounds complex. Musicians will appreciate the technique, while your average listener will love the groove! I challenge anyone to listen to ""Make Me Feel"" and ""Drink the Girl"" and not have the choruses ring in your head the rest of the day (but don't worry, its not the annoying ring that pop gives you). And ""Arabic Ska"" is definitely worth much more than 2 dollars! I promise you that while listening to this album, you will bop your head to the groove. Bypass the luge lessons, but definitely take your Summers In Rangoon."
4,Think Moxy Fruvous meets Morphine,"Tongue-in-cheek lyrics and upbeat rhythms keep this gem of a album going. Lush waves from Drink the Girl keep the band from getting too unserious, but how can you not hop to and grin at the food/fusion hep, hep sound of Arabic Ska?"
5,Unfriggingbelievable,"If you haven't heard this band yet, you need to buy this CD. You will not be disappointed. From the catchy feelgood jams of ""Make Me Feel,"" to the manic ""Arabic Ska,"" you will hear a satisfying eclectic mix of funky, jazzadelic, fusion-jam pop. So there!! Or you can just buy 5 falafels or half a lap-dance...""Baltic Dungeon"" is my personal favorite, but don't miss the classic homage ""Drink the Girl."" What can I say -- this band is destined for B-i-i-i-i-g thangs!!!!!!!! (Also - I heard they have a HOT new keyboard wizard. Can't wait to catch the act!)"
4,Good Course if Used With Other Courses,"I like Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese) by Pimsleur. I was already using and enjoying Language Dynamics Behind the Wheel Chinese-Mandarin and getting great results. Pimsleur's method also works but is somewhat rigid and doesn't allow for as much creativity as Behind the Wheel Chinese. Unlike Behind the Wheel Chinese, I also note that with Pimsleur you must remain with the CD track until it ends so that the graduated interval recall system is not interrupted. This is not always possible for me.Still, I recommend you buy this course since it is very good, as long as you use it along with a more versatile alternativesuch as Behind the Wheel Chinese."
3,Behind the Wheel Chinese is Much More Effective,As a foreign language instructor who knows the ropes (je connais les ficelles de mon metier) I too was quite disappointed with my experience with Pimsleur Instant Communication Chinese.Behind the Wheel Chinese taught more vocabulary and then taught me how to combine and compound it so that even a limited number of words gave me the ability to communicate greatly in Mandarin Chinese.I attribute the lion's share of what I now speak in Mandarin to Behind the Wheel Mandarin.I would highly recommend you try this course first and not later as I did. It could well be the only Mandarin CD course you will ever need.It is that good.
4,"Good, but not a masterpiece","Mordecai Richler is one of the greatest modern writers, and his Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz is a masterpiece; however, A Choice of Enemies falls short of being brilliant. It is, never-the-less, a very good book. Richler presents a great cold war story of divided and shifting loyalties. Richler also makes an insightful commentary about Canadian and European cultural and intellectual life."
3,Penetran plus review,This product works to reduce joint pain.It really works. DR. David Williams uses itto supplement his Joint supplements for thsgood reason.Also buy it at Amazon was a no-hassle exercise.B L Ho
3,"I know it works, just not for me.","I couldn't wait to get my order. My arm had been aching for weeks and nothing helped. My brother, who is an M.D., swears it is a miracle drug and has a standing order. I could go on and on with stories of friends and family who swear by it, but the bottom line - Penetran Plus didn't help my arm at all. I may try it another time for a different type of pain and see what happens."
5,Fantastic,"I have used this product for years. It soothes arthritis, sore muscles and joints without the ""Ben Gay"" smell or feel. It takes a fraction of the amount you would use in the more popular brands and has a pleasing lemon scent. At night before bed I apply a small amount to an area in need and wake up feeling great."
2,Save Your Money,I bought this book in addition to the official curriculum that MSPress publishes. I took the test today (4/18/02) and there might have been two questions on the test that this book covered. The official Microsoft book was more complete but in Microsoft's usual manner it is difficult to always discern what is needed and what is overkill. You are better off learning COM and ATL 3.0 because my test was very heavy on both topics.
3,Hits the topics but not specific enough.,"This book goes over the topics covered on the exam (a big plus!) but it would have been helpful if they expanded the exam watch section to really cover items on the test. As the book is written, the exam questions were just to specific (and on specifics not covered in the book) for me to pass."
4,Not what I expected,"Even though this is a nice book in many ways, it didn't actually meet my expectations. Most importantly, it didn't take away stress-related scrapbooking. In fact, the issue is covered only superficially. This book's strength is on helping you to organize your pictures and albums (way too many albums are proposed for the regular scrapbooker!). There is also a lot of journalling involved and that is an added pressure.Having said that, the author provides nice and useful samples of scrapbook layouts."
5,Too many pictures not in a scrapbook? Read this!,"Stacy Julian has a novel approach to scrapbooking--it does not have to be chronological, and you do not have to scrapbook every picture you have ever taken. Instead, you should scrapbook what is meaningful to you, and tells your story or the story of your family. One suggested project is a scrapbook that is a journal with pictures of just one month in your family's life. Stacy reminded me that ""the big picture"" of scrapbooking is meant to be fun."
4,Changed my idea od scrapbooking!,"As an ""always behind"" chronological scrapbooker this book brought me back to the reasons I originally loved scrapbooking! I love Stacy's philosophy and the way she organizes her memories! I found her ideas/views refreshing and unique."
5,Really changed my perspective on scrapbooking,"This book offered some wonderful insight on what scrapbooking is all about.. preserving memories in a meaningful way. It doesn't give you techniques in the traditional way (e.g. detailed descriptions of how to make a layout) but more of the ""big picture"" about what kind of books (or what else to use instead of a book) to make so you are not stuck with doing everything chronologically and making sure every picture is on a page."
5,The Big Picture Scrapbook Ideas,"I've been scrapbooking for about a year and own four books on the subject. I use this one by Stacy Julian the most because it contains more variety and more ideas outlined in an unfussy style.Years ago all my photos were just thrown in a box and now, thanks to The Big Picture, they are organized so the whole family can enjoy them and the collection and storytelling just keeps growing. I also used to collect paper, so scrapbooking for me was a no brainer.They will make nice keepsakes and carry on the family geneology."
5,Must have for Simple Scrapbook Fans,"As a huge fan of Simple Scrapbooks magazine I had to have this book. Stacy Julian reminds us that scrapbooking is supposed to be fun, not stressful. She also tries to show us that the little moments are just as important to scrapbook as the annual birthday or holiday celebration. Stacy Julian fills the book with lots of inspiring layouts, ideas about everyday scrapbooking, and fun ways to help you tap into your creative self. There are also some good creative projects, great resources, and some unique tips for how to organize your pages and albums. The tag book is a nice little added bonus to help you explore your creative inspirations.If you have discovered the ""Simple"" way of scrapbooking you will like this book. If you haven't discovered it yet, I highly recommend this book."
5,"Fabulous, stress-free, option to scappin'","I love this book! My friends have all read it, and we even signed up to take a class from Stacy Julian. Scrapbooking is my hobby, and this book provides a whole new approach that takes the stress out of getting behind. Stacy is truly innovative in her approach. I always knew it was about the memories, but chronological doesn't always work. Stacy gives great tips and ideas that make it seem so easy! I highly recommend this book. It is easy to read with the what, why, where format. You will want to read it several times. I looked at every page and skimmed the articles first, then I read it page by page. Awesome!!!"
2,"Looks good, works great.......at first",Save your reviews on this thing until you've owned it awhile. I used it only the end of one season and it worked well. I drained it and stored it inside. The next spring it wouldn't oscillate consistently. This sprinkler looked too good and appeared too well made so I bought another one. It too stopped oscillating consistently after one season. I would come out and find one area of the yard flooded and the rest dry. A sprinkler this expensive should last more than one season. I'm going to buy a cheap one and throw it away if it quits. I could make a down payment on a car for the price of two of these boat anchors.
1,Expect short lifespan,"Like another reviewer, I have found that the plastic gears on this sprinkler soon begin sticking, rendering it useless. I've bought two, one began sticking frequently after 2 months, the other after a season. I have the intake screened, so it's not due to dirt, the gearbox must be poorly designed."
2,out of date already,"I think the product would have been great if it wasn't outdated already. It will only read SD cards up to 2GB which you can hardly find any more since they are all 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, etc. You can find smaller SD cards on the internet for now but the way things are progressing, it would only be a matter of time before you wouldn't be able to get those either. Plus, that didn't help me because our office already had 3GB cards and up. Also, with the amount of money that they want for this DIGITAL machine, it needs to be updated to fit the capacity for which everything is going. So...... with that being said, they need to figure out how that machine can read higher SD cards. Being an at home transcriptionist, I would have loved to have been able to stick in my SD card and go!!!"
2,Good unit except.....,"As a previous poster already stated this unit only supports up to 2GB SD cards. Unless Philips releases a firmware update for SDHC cards or you have a large supply of 2GB or less SD cards stay away from this unit. Other than this major shortcoming, it's a pretty good device."
3,"Extremely small, only 2 sizes","These safety pins are tiny--barely 3/4"" long. In the product dimensions they did not provide safety pin dimensions, but packaging dimensions.Moreover, by ""assorted sizes"" they must mean ""two different sizes"". Two tiny sizes of safety pins.Function was fine.Overall I give it 3 stars, for good function, but a lack of variety, and unexpected small size."
3,"Not quite ""assorted"" sizes","This product is fine if what you are looking for is size small and smaller. There are only those 2 sizes in there -- no medium or large safety pins. The vendor was fine, product came on time, though not Prime eligible.Returned item with no trouble - will purchase next size up. ."
1,Assorted sizes is FALSE!,"Even though I was actually expecting ""assorted sizes"" (eg. small & medium at least) for the money I paid, they were all the same extra-extra ""small"" safety pins that I actually get in a ""real"" assorted pack and all that are left over are these itsy bitsy pins. Useless. :("
2,pins are very small,If you want small black pins then ok buy this..very small tho just FYI...ok for that use only
5,Pointer To Another Review,"Les Vampires is discussed in very favorable terms by Geoffrey O'Brien in the Dec. 17, 1998 edition of the New York Review of Books."
2,Blu-Ray only 2 Stars....? Keep the DVD no Blu-Ray update needed,I bought the DVD Remasterd some Years ago and I was blown away from this amazing Silent Movie from 1915-1916 DVD Picture was pretty good too so to my Amazement now it has been released in Blu-Ray Quality and I was really looking forward watching this Masterpice again in true HD Blu-Ray Quality but I was very Dissapointet because the Picture was still the same Pherhaps even worse.....? I think they only took the 1996 remasterd DVD release and transferd it into Blu-Ray without proper Picture improvement Remastering into 2012 Standard.....? I dont like this Blu-Ray release Picture is not what I expect from Blu-Ray.......? If you own the DVD release no need for this Blu-Ray release.....? Movie is 5 Stars / DVD is 5 Stars / but this Blu-Ray i only give it two Stars.....? now Im really Worried about the upcomming Fritz Lang Nibelungen Blu-Ray release.....?
1,Arrogance Creeps Into Too Many Entries,"While this highly detailed volume is valuable for its scope--some 5,000 entries--I found that the arrogance of the author crept into so many entries that the book is more misleading than informative. Therefore, use this book as a spelling guide, and ignore Riddick's constant characterizations of major and minor players in British India. Pity Riddick coiuld not have just given us the information on these personalities without the tawdry editorializing."
4,Metahistory,"Depending on your familiarity with the study of history this book may be either over- or under-rated. It is fantastic text and highly informative. That said, a few cautionary notes:This book has diminishing returns. I read the whole thing, but the book is rather formulaic. Spend more time on the Introduction than anything else. Without it you'll be lost.Also I have little familiarity with the authors White discusses. With the ones I did know, Nietszche, Hegel, and Tocqueville, I found his commentary very interesting. But some familiarity with each author addressed would be worthwhile to enjoy it fully.Hope it was useful. Whether or not you buy his argument, the work is definitely a modern classic."
5,"An extraordinary, evocative book","I read this book the first time in 1979 when it was published. I had never read anything like it. The young characters were all from my generation, did the things I did, and took the risks I took. I was very moved by this book. The prose evoked the rather disoriented late 1970s perfectly.I went back and read ""Black Tickets"" again last summer and was pleasantly surprised to discover how evocative the book still is and how moving the language is. This book is a masterpiece."
2,didn't do it for me,"i was excited to read this book. the enthusiatic reviews by so many upstanding authors made me feel i was about to embark on a journey into something forceful & important. instead, i found myself barely submerged in a lot of jibberish and unfocused monologues.there were 1 or 2 compelling stories in the book, but for the most part- i could have cared less. there wasn't anything about most of the characters that made me want to enter their worlds- i kept reading, hoping to find whatever it was the critics were raving about.needless to say, i never found it."
2,love/hate,"I love and hate these stories, but mostly..I hate them. Maybe ""hate"" is putting too fine a point on it. I know Raymond Carver's wife gushed that ""Black Tickets"" was the ""unmistakable work of early genius"" but she and I must have read different books. These stories are, for the most point, pretentious and awkward. Come on--""the snowy Bible hums?"" ""Her breasts balloon, the sky opens inside them?"" What the hell does that mean? I can't even visualize it. Kudos to Phillips for experimentation, but it doesn't work. I have to say that I do like ""Lechery"" and evidently so do many others, because it is heavily anthologized. ""Black Tickets"" is also compelling: bleak, black worlds these. Yet in the end these stories feel thin and undeveloped: abstractions rather than gritty experience."
1,Great product! and love it!!,"I haven't found the usability so difficult, and rather found it easy to use.Initially, I really loved this unit.Then, about 3 months later, it started having trouble, and hasn't worked right since. Despite a month at the ""factory authorized"" service center (over half-hour away!! and only open inconvenient hours), it still doesn't work right. It won't even record at all now. I am bringing my device for the 4th time tomorrow. So right now I have a _really_ expensive box that worth less than my VCR...I've read a lot of other positive reviews, but I wish I'd never bought this thing now.Changing from 4 star to 1 star..."
3,Poor Manuals,"i can only confirm, what other reviewers already said. Very poor manuals. I consider myself an Audio/Video expert, but the set-up was horrible. I ""upgraded"" from the Philips 985, which was a piece of cake in usage... but so far i have come to a lot of frustration. I guess i need many more hours to figure this thing out."
1,$700 repair bill,"Panasonic is off my list, I will never buy another Pansonic product. After spending almost $1,000 on this purchase it stopped working in only two years. The estimated cost of repairs at the Panasonic service center was over $700. Live and learn."
4,Pros & cons,Pros- Good compression quality in real time- Burn upto 6 hours of video on one DVD-R- Fast forward upto 100x while diving and shorting programs- DVD-R has good compatibility with all of my DVD playersCons- Cannot record date/time information with DV connection- Cannot dubbing finalized DVD back to HDD to burn more copies- Cannot play DVD+R and DVD+RW (I couldn't play them on other players either)
4,Cannot Dub from the Disc!!!,"I agree with all the great things that everyone has been saying about the unit, but If you are looking forward to copying some of your own DVD to the HDD, you better think twice.Almost at the end of a poorly written operating instructions manual, there is a small little line that says ""Cannot Dub from the Disc"" this should be in bold letter on the top of the box. instead the hide it in the back of the manual.I ending up hooking my old sony DVD to the AVin, and that did the trick, so I hope this help those of you who are looking for the function that does not exist in this unit."
2,Product Info is misleading,"I bought this unit based on information ...., which states the DMR E100HS's ability to read images and video from analog VHS, DV connections, SD or microdrives etc...however all is not true, which I would have known sooner, if I had downloaded the manual.Basically the only way it can read MPEG4 videos on SD [not pc cards]is when the unit has actually written the file itself. It can only read JPEG-TIFF stills from pc or SD cards. The only way to import any video into the HHD for editing is by connecting VHS, S-VHS, or a direct feed from your digital camera, or TV.The unit it easy to work, and does a nice job with the DVD's from VHS. You can also hook it up to your TV and record shows onto the HD.However, I would advise anyone interested in this unit to download the manual and read carefully so you undestand it's limitaions BEFORE you spend the money."
1,Horrible Movie,This had to be one of the worst movies that I have seen-its extremely boring and the characters are as dull as the film.No plot to speak of and you can't tell if the Bill character is dreaming or actually awake. Please don't waste your money even on a rental
1,This Movie is terrible-what a dud!!,Do not waste your money to rent or buy this one. Although it has a pretty good cast-Sharon Stone and Timothy Hutton--the plot is confusing--it jumps around alot and is boring--to say the least. The actors seem to just walk thru their roles in a senseless plot. I guess they needed the money. I barely made it thru the movie--good thing I just rented it and lost only $3--stay away from this one. My question is--Why did they make this straight to video movie?
1,Really boring,"Don't your time and save your money, for sure, one of the most boring you can look at. I can't imagine someone would buy it."
2,A Misfire,"A good cast struggles valiantly, but ultimately unsuccessfully, with a woefully underwritten script. This character study focuses on four people, probably in their late 30s or early 40s (we really don't know, but the couple has a son who seems to be about 16), who for various reasons are unhappy with themselves, with their lives, and with each other. Unfortunately, since we do not know how any of them arrived at where they are, all we are given is a snapshot in time with no past reference points, which really does not allow the viewer to develop much empathy for any of the characters. If a film is going to be a character study, then the writer needs to provide some background and better-developed characters so the viewer to somehow relate to them. And oh yes - we have another film where after a traumatic event two of the characters miraculously begin to cope with their problems."
1,Hopeless,"I see that a couple of reviewers were kind enough to award some extra stars for the potential of a film like this one. Sorry, but every movie has the potential to be a good one; but when it is poorly scripted, poorly plotted and poorly acted, it will be a horrible film. This is a horrible, horrible film, which wanders as aimlessly as its characters. I seem to be beating a dead horse, but I felt compelled to add my voice to the chorus of those who literally felt cheated by the misrepresentation of what this film aimed to be. Or, is that the point? Is all of life a misrepresentation; perhaps a sort of waking dream? What if . . . nah, don't bother -- the message is hopeless."
3,When a man falls,"This was the worst movie I have seen, the star make, it almost makes us not want to purchase any more of her movies."
4,Awesome plan seeks better editor,"The plan itself is excellent and I've tried several. It's already making me a better triathlete. However, the writing/editing could be stronger. It's slightly cumbersome, requiring more page flipping and reading between the lines than I'd prefer, but for the modest investment required, the inconvenience is far outweighed by the strength of the plan."
4,Lots of good Information and facts.,"This book helps a lot. It teaches you how to train, when to train, what sorts of things you should do, and different foods to eat. This will help you prepare. It is a great purchase."
5,terrific,This is one of the best cajun groups and this cd is awesome.We love accordian and Steve Riley is one of the best. Thanks
3,Stiff non-metallic hose,"Can't hardly tell by the picture, but there is a clear plastic tube that houses the hose on the exterior and it makes it stiff. My original Grohe hose was metal and hung much smoother than this one. This one feels cheaper."
1,Poor content and presentation,"This book presents information retrieval in an incomprehensible fashion. The content appears to have been cut and pasted from diverse unrelated sources with no effort put into massaging the parts into a coherent whole. There are several mistakes, typos, and wrong formulas throughout the book. Often concepts and abbreviation pop out without any context. Loose statements that are vague and hard to understand are made in several places. The book also fails to use a consistent style in its presentation. Overall, it does little to explain anything in Information Retrieval."
