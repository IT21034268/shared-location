2,Dark Age of Nerfs Alot,"This game was released before the developers even finished. The classes are not balanced, Mythic keeps nerfing the classes based on their mistakes and on the whinning of dissatisfied players. Now they are introducing an expansion pack. Sheesh... They don't even have the basic game fixed yet. It is a good game but would have the potential to be a fantastic game if they would fix the classes."
3,Few problems need to be fixed for game to prosper...,"Game is great however more bugs and issues are surfacing...1 - Realms are not balanced... MIDGARD much too powerful, Albion average and Hibernia weak.2. - Not all dungeons are itemized...ie: games not filled with content. (this is another case of product being rushed to street)3. In-Game customer support [not good]. You submit an appeal and never hear from them. You do one offline and support tells you to contact on-line customer support.4. Dungeons often too crowded also.Realm wars are fun however MIDGARD always wins. Just too powerful and too many for other realms to compete. Game needs more balance. May wanna hold off on this one and look for Shadowbane at the beginning of 2K2"
1,Not as good as it was talked up to be,"After anxiously awaiting this game to be received and after installing, I was dismally disappointed with this purchase. Gameplay was slow and very much tainted with ingame latency, not unlike usual internet lag (currently using cable modem). Control setup leaves alot to be desired. I would not recommend this game to any serious MMORPG fan. Stick with the best >> Everquest << Just my opinion."
1,Utter disaster...,"Having no mention of the monthly fee was bad enough (I now see that it has been added to the end of the description) but even if this game were free, it still would disappoint. My system easily exceeds the minimum requirements yet I have been unable to play for more than a minute before locking up or simply crashing. The concept is great and I'm sure there are those out there successfully enjoying the game, but for me (and I'm sure many like me) it has been a disaster. Stay away until the necessary improvements are made. Now if only I hadn't given it as a gift!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I purchased this game when it first hit the shelves. What a mistake. I loaded the game on my computer and a week later removed it. If you are a EQ fanatic. Stay with EQ. Don't waste your time with this one.
1,Look elsewhere if you want PvP,"I was late to buy this game after having two friends recommend it, and boy am I glad. Much like the other reviewers, I found this game to be huge fun at first, but my overall goal was to get to the point where I could stop doing PvC and start doing PvP. After spending the 145 hours required to do this I entered the PvP Realm vs. Realm action, and WOW was I dissapointed.If you don't have eight REALLY close friends that are all willing to choose different classes of races, level at the same time you do, and all have enough money to get 2 copies of the game, don't even bother trying to do the PvP. There is really no skill involved, and it turns out that occasionally Mythic will reduce your class's abilities because other people have complained, RUINING the 300+ hours invested in your character. This was my first experience in RPG online gaming.. and I could not have been more dissapointed."
3,Mythic ...,"The game play is excellent nad the comcept increadible... But as the game progressed Mythic took it upon themselves to 'balance' the realms. This envolved giving other realm more skills and changing the rules in others. Unfortunately, they did not do this mathmatically but rather but who complained about what the most. Unfortunatley Mythic has now ruined the experience for all game players. I would not even waste my time with this game. Be patient and get Shadowbane (when it is released), Earth & Beyond, or go for Star Wars Galaxies when it is released. You will have a less frusterating day after some good game time. Mythic DAoC expansion is coming out.. Unless you heas otherwise hit the VN Boards before purchase."
2,Not all that,"I have been out of the MMORPG world since I hung up my UO account in 1999 after two years of play. When I first started with UO, I couldn't put it down. It enthralled me, ensnared me, and I found myself spending every available moment building my characters into Grand Masters.This game has been completely unable to do that for me. I find myself mindlessly hacking a few monsters, not really caring either way, and eventually walking cross country for hours trying to find something interesting to do. Oh, and did I mention that technical support doesn't exist? Yeah, they have this thing called ""petition"" for when you have a problem with the game... No one EVER answers it.It's to the point that I can't imagine anyone enjoying this game beyond the mild amusement of having pretty pictures flash across the screen and cheap chatroom-style conversations with fellow players. Bah...I bought this game based on Gamespot's rating of ""SUPERB"". Frankly, I've got no idea what they were thinking."
4,It's all about PVP,"A lot of reviewers have written that this game is just EQ on steroids, but they're wrong... People who play EQ sit on the side of the fence of fighting boring AI or sitting around chatting. If you're from the world of PvP, this is definitely one to get, for those of you who play Lineage, this is Lineage except on a massive scale. The Realm versus Realm wars are incredible, with seige engines in 3D. It has better graphics than EQ and new features are being added all the time. There is also no ""zoning"" which can be a pain in EQ. Parties also share experience from the lowest to the highest level, unlike EQ where everyone camps around to fight one guy to get that item. The rogues are also MUCH more developed than any other MMORPG on the market, with the ability for stealth, backstab, mixed fighting styles, and some advanced rogue abilities that you should find out for yourself."
4,DAoC Take it from me,"Bottom line is DAoC is a great game. I've playd AC, AC2, and DAoC and after the initial shock I am liking DAoC much better. The only drawback to the game is that the game doesn't REALLY get started untill you reach lvl 20, or at least lvl 10. Nice graphics, good character creation, cool spells and combat moves. If your a online RPG fan this is your game. Have fun."
4,Initial Impressions Almost Killed It,"I bought this game because frankly I was looking for a MMORPG but I didn't know where to look. I was in CompUSA at the time and I asked the guy for his reccomendation. He said Ultima Online which I looked at and it said no XP support, so I looked on. Next, random people that were passing said that Dark Age of Camelot was one of the best so I picked it up.At first I thought the game was basically the same as what I saw from my limited time at Everquest. That being a convulted interface and extrememely large learning curve. So I uninstalled the game. However, one of my friends wanted to see it and I reinstalled it and picked a different character on a co-op server and was blown away. Once you get past the inital problems and issues with the interface the game seems to open up.Now, I'm only level 4 but from what I've seen I'll probably stick with this game. At least until World of Warcraft from Blizzard comes out."
2,Good to start then falls off,"Though the game was quite addicting at first (Levels 1-20), it then began to loose some of its uniques as you spend most of your time leveling at an extremely slow pace. The quests are a tad bit on the lean side. After you reach level 50 the game looses much of its appeal as you cant level any higher. The main problem i had with the game is there was no purpose for your character. Sure you had quests but after you finsih them all whats next? wandering around killing people. Not my idea of fun."
3,"Good game, but VERY SMALL","I played this game for about two months before I decided that I was sick of looking at the same scenery over and OVER again. If you play in any of the realms, all it is is forest, plains, or dungeon. I recently switched to EQ and I'm pretty please so far. DAoC has some pretty good graphics, but I think I'll go back to it when some content is added."
4,Everquest II,"So far I am pleased with Dark Age of Camelot, however I don't know if it will be able to ""suck me in"" the way Everquest did several years ago.The interface for DAoC is excellent and will be very familiar to EQ players, which makes for an easy transition.Something about the game (that I haven't quite figured out yet) discourages open chat, so if one of your complaints about EQ was the inane banter happening in many zones, there appears to be less of that here.The graphics/animation/sound are fantastic.There are some neat things built in to prevent camping, to prevent higher levels from killing lower level creatures, to keep newbies safe, etc.I like it enough that I am going to stick with it for awhile."
4,"Excellent, but could be bigger","I bought this game a week ago and have been playing it for hours since. While its extremely enjoyable and has a very rich world, the world isn't quite as big as i expected it to be. Of course, there's still exploring on each realm to do (I just stopped playing D2, this is a great change), but i expected the world to be as big as EQ. However, this game has far better graphics and concepts (no doubt you've heard that RvR owns you :P), as well as tons of choices to make from which god to follow, which class, what you want to do in that class, etc. I strongly reccomend buying this game. (...)"
2,Not as Good as it sounds,"As a noob u dont know anything about the game. When u are low lvl no one seems to try to help u. I asked about 20 people for help and no one even answers. Since there are so many NPC's and highly detailed buildings u move very sklowly. For about 30 mins i am ending up spinning in circles because i cant turn to get out of the very laggy town. Its seems a waste of time and gets very annoying. After lvl 6 after u die u lose experiance so if u were to get almost the next lvl. If u are soloing you die and die now your back to phase one, gives u major headache."
2,lost interest in the level grinding,"played this game for nearly 7 months paying 12.95 for the privelege top characters were a 32 level hero and a 34 level champ i found drops in one of the realms not to be on level or useful item prices at the merchants way beyond reasonble compared with hunting and selling items that were huntedi found some very rude players on line and some nice ones as wellwithout help or guild it was very hard to play , some of the fan sites boards were increidabley flaming instead of helpful and encouragingin the end it is my first mmrpg and most certainly my last mmrpg i will ever play very glad for game consoles and other choices of gaming genres'update bout feb i reached 50 end game with champ did rvr for about a week then cancled the account no way could i begin to level up another toon doing the same thingbefore i cancled the account midguard had df on 12 of the 16 servers and rvr was pointlessly outnumbered for the rest of the realms to make rvr fun at that point an time"
5,DAoC rules,"this is a great MMORPG for everyone for the PvM (player vs monster) people out there the monsters are great and always fun to kill to gain some money now for you PvPers (play vs player) people out there I haven't found a better game if you want to go it solo you can easily do that with any class in the game of course some classes are better than others in solo and with stealth this is espeachly true Stealth is a skill that allows u to run at a bit slow pace but unseen to other players untill u are hiting them. For players who prefer the more normal method u can always be a tank and bash people over the head with ur sword mace sheild ect, for the magic usesers out there you can be anything from a top quality nuker to a person who attacks with a pet this game is well worth the money the support is great they are always updating it and adding new things and the camelotherald.com website is sweet to keep track of how you and your guild mates and other friends stack up against others in PvP"
3,Still just leveling treadmill,I played AC extensively. I played DAoC for about 2 months. In the end--bordom took over. this is just another leveling treadmill that will consume a large amount of time but leave you empty and bored. great graphics. good support staff. good servers.
2,So-So Game,"Let me start off by saying-There is Awful PvP. Ultima Online(a 5 year old game) has better PvP than. Second off, getting around the world is also bad. There are no portals,recalls or teleaports. You have to run everywhere or take a horse(still takes 30min from realm to realm). Thirdly, Combat is very plain- a few special moves and repeative motion of beating something with a sword or casting a few spells over-and-over. Finally, it is very very newb unfriendly. You will get no help from anyone(unlike UO or EQ). The only thing I liked was the few parties I got into. It was fun with all different characters working together."
4,Very addictive,"MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online roleplaying games) are a breed unlike any other computer game, and DAoC is one of the best out there.Sure, it has its problems like any MMORPG, but overall it's captivating and immensely fun. This game really begins when you hit the highest levels and can adventure in the frontiers, fighting real player enemies, which, let's face it, is definitely more challenging and exciting than fighting AI monsters.The game does appear to be more geared to hardcore players who can devote a lot of time to it than to casual players.There are three realms to explore and numerous class/race combinations you can create within those realms.The user interface is pretty friendly - someone who had never played an MMORPG could catch on to DAoC pretty quickly."
4,Fun game,"The game is fun, however after awhile it will become Tediously boring.. Once you aquire one or more level 50 charactors the only thing your able to do is Realm Vs Realm. And that does get quite old.. quite fast.. Realm vs Realm Combat is fast paced.. and can get o be annoying. Graphics are less then disireable.. however with the new expantion coming out they fixed graphics. but you MUST HAVE GEForce 3, 4 or Better to view all the graphics.. Thats pritty demanding. Overall its a great game they have fixed alot of the problems with it. I beleave 4 stars for the Effort of Mythic is deserving. They have tried hard to make a good game. Prehaps to hard. Its fun, But only for approx one year durations time."
1,**BUYER BEWARE**,"What started out as a fun and entertaining game has quickly turned into one of the worst run Role-Playing Games today. Clearly 1/3 of the description covered on the box HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED! Class imbalance, lack of content, lack of rule-enforcement, and really lack of goal has taken a game and driven it to it's knees.When the game first came out, it was expected that a few things would have to finished over a short period, but after several months, the game is worse than when it first came out.I would NOT recommend buying this game at this point. There are several other games on the market that do a much better job and are much more pleasant to play."
4,Subscription needed to play,The only gripe I have with this game is the fact that you don't find out about the subscription rates until you're deep into setting it up. It also takes a lot of digging on the Mythic web site to find info about the monthly subscription.
1,Terrible game for most,"I played through this game and it is just a leveling treadmill, the storyline is meager and once you hit the highest level there isn't anything fun to do, the player vs player is slow and leveling is slow, I would reccomend getting ultima online, everquest, or when asheron's call 2 comes out get that."
1,"How about pointing out the ""small monthly fee"" before we buy","$10 a month is not a small fee when there is no warning about it when the purchase is made. The thing should be free, not $30. I checked again and found no reference to the fee, only that ""an internet connection is required"". My 12 year old is pretty dissappointed in Amazon for this."
2,Promising but botched,"If you enjoy tedious activities, hours of boredom, and seconds of fun dispersed inbetween, than this game is for you! If you enjoy mindless, mob-based and mismatched combat in which outcomes are determined by sheer coincidence of numbers and repetitive exploits, you will like this game! If you like well-thought out and fast paced pvp games that posit relatively equal numbers of characters with balanced abilities agaisnt each other in frequently rewarding engagements, you will be disappointed by this game.In all honesty, this game is great 20-40 seconds at a time in pvp combat. However, it can take 3-8 hours to generate these short bouts of fun. It's really disappointing that Mythic isn't competent enough to capatalize on a good concept by turning those seconds of fun into minutes, or even hours by making some simple adjustments.My advice: wait for Star Wars Galaxies. Do NOT reward Mythic for their laziness."
2,It's okaybut...,"I purchased one of these unit a few years ago, may they improved them...But the tubes were heavy duty tubes like a wrapping paper left over tube, but of course much thicker. Some of the tubes and connectors did not fit and had to be hammer together, sometimes causing damage to the tubes. The tubes and connectors would also got lose. It did not last long especially for the price. I giving 2 stars because our cats did love it."
1,"short, pointless","Please note that this video is only 12 minutes long--just long enough to give each famous designer a few moments. The video does a poor job of showing the rooms each designed and makes no attempt to investigate the design process. Boring. I purchased it to see Tom Wolfe, whose idea of a Greek-style frieze showing scenes from NYC life was at least interesting, but got no insight into his thought process here."
2,Swirly Painter Toy,My kids in my art class liked this toy until they all got to make more than one swirl art picture and then most of them said that they were getting too bord with this toy. The great thing aabout this toy is that it creates virtually no mess and this toy is very easy to clean up with soap and water. The bad thing about this toy is that it uses up the paint and paper very quickly making it expensive in the long run when you have to purchase paint and paper every 7-16 days. This toy was also not very challenging to the kids and I guess that is why they lost interest very quickly. This toy is great though to use at events such as the Spring carnival we held at my school/work. The kids didn't mind paying $.50 to make a swirl art picture and some kids even came back 2 or 3 times to make another print.
4,Where do you find refills!!!,"OK it's definitely a fun toy, and it's not messy but you just plough through the supplies in no time especially the paper. Usually along with the toy you can order a refill at the same time. A little disappointing."
4,Hee hee!,"I remember playing with this or something like this as a kid and I LOVED it. Heck, I'm 25 now and thinking I should have one again. :-) No, I don't have kids, it's for me.And I have no clue how durable this version is, I just guessed cuz its required for the review."
2,Good philosophy but limited advice,"While I like the concept, the actual useable advice is very slim. Trying just a little too hard to be cute and amusing, without providing enough practical ""meat."""
1,Useless waste of time/money,"The author took a cutesy idea and stretched it out to fill a book. There is little or no useful information here for do-it-yourselfers. This whole volume could be condensed to a forgettable article in an in-flight magazine, and it would still be lame. Does not deserve the star I gave it."
2,Too much philosophy....confuses the mind.,I don't think this is quite what you're looking for. It's a lot of philosophy...and I mean a lot. Eastern thought to Western thought to Mary Baker Eddy ad nauseum and more philosophy. It would drive me crazy to actually read every word. I did a good thorough job of skimming it though. I was disappointed that all I read was so unclear it left me with nothing to think on but the cobwebs it left in my brain. And I was also disappointed that it appeared to speak nothing on the 'Christian' cults we see today. This is a book jam-packed-filled with philosophic thought....a confusing mess one might say.I would highly recommend letting this book alone and reading instead a book on modern religious cults written by one knowledgable of the truth of God's Word.-----
4,Good product,This is a good all purpose little jar. The 4oz size works well for small containers of body butter or salve. The lids fit well and its easy to label each jar with the contents. I have purchased this is in a larger size as well. They are nothing fancy but very practical and inexpensive.
4,Marvelous exposition of the psychological aspects of Dante's Commedia,"I have recently discovered the work of genius that is Dante's [Divine] Comedy. This is a work that, as another reviewer says, requires multiple readings and will turn your life inside out if you approach it in the same spirit that Dante approached Virgil and Beatrice, his guides through the afterlife: a spirit that is humble and receptive.I've found it helpful to read some of the many commentaries on this work, and Jones has been nearly as useful in this regard as Helen Luke and Dorothy Sayers. His approach leans heavily to the psychological view, and if that's not your thing you may be put off. It happens to be mine, but I'm aware that, as with any reductionist view of art, something is lost when we explain too much. Read Sayers' marvelous translation first, then Helen Luke, and then, if you want more in Luke's vein, read Jones."
2,My product experience very different,"I often go by Amazon reviews but this time I got disappointed. Too small a sample maybe?Item handle appeared rusted.Assembled item was rickety.Item manual contained errors (use long bolts to fasten poles to floor stabilizers, not short bolts! and at least one other error that escapes me)And sadly, the item did not help my mother. She was unable to get up despite her best efforts, using this device.But as always, Amazon is great. I printed my free shipping return labels in minutes and I can get it out of the house tomorrow."
1,Welding snapped after 1 month of use,"I bought this for my father who just had a stroke. He came home in June, and used this for one month. Today, the welding that holds the cane upright snapped and he can no longer use this product. Luckily, he wasn't hurt when he fell after the welding snapped except for a few bruises. He only weighs 145 lbs, and was using the product exactly as intended. I do not recommend this product for anyone with a fall risk, even though I don't know who else would actually need something like this."
2,NOT QUITE!,"I wish I'd known more about this product before I'd ordered and received it. It is only for those who need help with BAlance, not for those who need a firm object to pull oneself UP. Not weightbearing, so one must be very careful not to damage the thing. Wanting to return it..."
4,Couch Cane,"The Couch Cane sounds like a great idea. It is sturdy and well made. I bought one for my mother who doesn't use it because it is too tall even in the lowest position.However, I think it would be a great assist for many people."
3,Needs to adjust about 4 inches shorter,I bought this for my mother to help her get out of her chair after arm surgery.. Turned out to be too high for her to use. Should adjust down at least 4 more inches to really be beneficial. I can use it though so its a keeper.
5,Good book...,...that provides solid information on building and designing furniture. This focuses more on the design part while the first two books in the series focus on basics and techniques.
4,completely mad,Somewhat disappointed by the format. I had thought it would have been devoted more to the magazine itself. A good history of the comic book development though. It would have been nice to see a complete index of the covers (dated of course). Overall the book does justice to the magazine and it's development. A must have if you are a fan.
3,Jungian Neuman?,"Some of Reidelbach's conclusions are a little bizarre (check out that strange correlation between Neuman and Renaissance Theater), and the book is biased toward Gaines and the crew. Otherwise, this is a fine history, laid out in an appropriately anarchic style. It's kind of ironic: when articles from the 50s are juxtaposed with those from more recent years, you realize with sadness that Mad's really lost a lot of its quality."
2,Dumbek,"If you are looking for Dumbek drum music, this is NOT what you want. The music is good, but you would expect to hear this in Twin Peaks or some surrealistic mystery movie. This does not contain any Middle Eastern flavor at all."
5,Freedom for Whom?,"[...]The Emancipation Proclamation does not, as is usually believed, put an end to slavery in the United States. It ends slavery (technically but not really until the war ends) only in those states and portions of states which are at the time of signing (January 1 1862) in open rebellion against the United States of America. It orders military units moving into those areas to procure real freedom for those who are technically freed by the proclamation. It also orders that men who are eligible to be soldiers be accepted into the Union army. In real fact, very few white men would fight alongside black men, and ""black regiments"" with white officers were created as time went by. This should be read by all students of American history as an example of a document which does NOT do what most people think it does."
3,Emancipation Proclamation,"This was pretty boring. However, it is an important document. If you're a senator or something, get it. If you aren't you can, or you can't. The good thing is it's free."
5,Excellent.,"An excellent biography of Godel. Examines his personal life and mathematical work in an integrated manner. Dawson is thorough, well-researched, and shows a command of the mathematics involved. He provides the most accurate picture available of the real Godel- in contrast to the anecdotal, 'crazy-genius' stories you see elsewhere. This is not a popular account of Godel's work, so the reader will need an understanding of fundamental mathematical logic and Godel's theorem to appreciate much of the book. But Dawson does provide a lot of history of mathematical logic, including a great chapter on developments up to 1928 that could stand by itself. The appendix provides a chronology, genealogy, and ""biographical vignettes"" of other important logicians."
1,Quality of the paperback is poor.,"The one star refers to the quality of the paperback, which I purchased from Amazon, not to the contents of the work. Both the text and photographs in the interior of the book have the appearance of a mediocre scan. The text is readable but, after a few pages, I found it so unpleasant that I quit. I'll try to find a copy of the hardback."
4,Godel and von Neumann,"I have always wondered how Godel got his name even within the Mathematics circle, considering his proof of incompleteness theorem is so hard to grasp--seemingly bordering on Philosophy where vagueness sometimes a virtue. In fact, his proof is perfectly constructive and meticulous, and I think it shows the boundaries of human intelligence or living creatures as a whole. This book reveals it was von Neumann, another genius of the time, who firstly and immediately recognized his work and supported him throughput."
2,"Great toaster, but the oven has limitations","Great toaster, but bakes unevenly, December 30, 2006Reviewer: Susan Schayes ""suziesilverado"" (Washington, D.C.) - See all my reviewsNot sure what all the hype is about.Yes, it does make excellent toast. The appliance was designed to look unconventional, has interesting settings, and is a great size if you have limited counterspace,But it cooks unevenly. My pizza was burnt on the back edge and soft in the middle. Other high-cost toaster ovens include a baking grill in the box, which might have helped. A small baked potato had to be rotated to cook both sides without burning and still had some raw spots in the center.The high tech light feature is distracting. You can't look at it or leave the light on for an extended time since its connected to the heater. Lastly, cooking doesn't stop automatically if you open the oven door, so there is a chance you can get burned."
2,You Will Get Burned,"Yes, a great toaster. But every side is aluminum (or something) and heats up right along with the inside. Even the front of the toaster heats up - everywhere except the slim handle, in fact, which you can't use without your knuckles at least grazing the hot oven window. Even knowing this I burned myself twice in the first week of use. Keep kids far away from this thing - you literally can't use it at all without oven mitts on."
4,Great toaster oven!,"I got my toaster oven in last week and have been using it ever since. So far, I have baked cookies, cooked frozen pizza, heated appetizers, and toasted sandwiches with this unit. It instantly heats, so no more waiting 10 minutes for the oven to pre-heat. It cooks evenly and has adjustable settings so you customize it just the way you like. For frozen pizza, you push one button, come back 5 minutes later, and your meal is ready to eat! The only negative that I can think of is that the side closer to the rear of the oven seems to cook things a bit darker than the items closer to the front glass door. Other than that, I love it!"
4,Great little oven,This is a nice oven. It cooks things faster than a conventional toaster oven and has nice features. The only drawback I see is there's no ability to broil. But I have found plenty of uses for this oven and I find I can do things in this one that I would never of done with my old one. Great product!
4,"Great, but don't throw the microwave away","After a few weeks of use:1. It looks great and pretty well built. Well, it is among the more expensive toaster ovens, and looks like it.2. It toasts and browns very well. With its dual-band infrared, however, it still cooks too shallow for many food items. Many other reviewers mentioned this. I use microwave oven first for items like pot pie and ""hot pockets"" with slightly reduced time, and then use this toaster oven to brown it. I believe Panasonic actually makes a microwave/small oven combination unit, but pretty expensive. My own combination works just fine for now.3. The feet of the oven don't provide enough friction on counter top, so the whole unit tend to slide when pushing the buttons (and every thing is controlled by buttons)."
5,Perfect toast!,"I'd read all the reviews and this one sounded great. And it is! I've never had better toast, English muffins and open faced sandwiches. It's also pretty easy to clean and fast! Really happy with this product."
4,Panasonic Infrared Toaster Oven,"Best toaster oven we have owned.The infrared really works well.Makes great toast, up to 4 slices at a time depending on bread size.We also use it for heating up chicken, chicken nuggets, leftover meat.Does a great job and tastes better than microwaved meat.This toaster is fast and toasts better than some toasters.The oven part works well for reheating.We havent tried much baking in it though, so cant comment on that.It has been in used daily for more than 5 years, and continues to work well.One drawback is that it doesnt have precise times on the LED clock timer.You have to use 1.0, 1.5, 2.5 2.0 minutes etc.A better method would be like a microwave and to use seconds.Also temperature setting is not precise.For speed, and great even toasting and reheating this is a great toaster oven.We tried out several other brands, before buying this one.Too bad it is not made anymore, but hopefully they have a better replacement.Infrared technology is great."
4,fast and pratical,"great performance on small frozen pizza & reheated, frozen biscuits, making grilled cheese, cuban, toasting subs, baked potatoes, meatloaf, cookies. anything that can be made in 2's or 3's the size fits perfectly. i wouldnt do chicken again because of the splatter factor but all the things i have mentioned i've cooked numerous times...again if your big into pizza, biscuits or sandwiches its PERFECT. a bit small yes...not meant for making roasts but everything else...and the inside isnt great cause theres no enamel only aluminum siding or metal material and it tarnished after using Easy OFF oven cleaner but it does clean easy...i do wish it had some kind of inner enamel to make it look not so..cheap..but really good performance..and NO PREHEATING...i would buy again if mine broke down..."
3,"Overall good, except with 4 slices","We didn't have a toaster oven, so this units comes in very handy, we use it all the time for reheating food and making toast.Our old 4-slice toaster was on its last legs, so we thought this unit could also replace that. Well I can fit 4 slices in this thing, but the outer edges of the bread don't get toasted. If it turn on longer then the inner bread gets burnt. This thing doesn't really toast 4-slices very evenly. With 2-slices it seems to be fine. For 4-slices a dedicated 4-slice toaster would be better.Overall, I'd still buy this again, unless I could find a toaster oven that did a better job toasting 4-slices of bread.I got it at a good price on Amazon and got my twenty dollar rebate check from Panasonic."
1,Spontaneously caught fire while toasting bread,"I used to love this toaster (purchased 11/06). We kept the insides immaculately clean and only used it for toasting or warming dry foods. While toasting bread, the unit caught fire. When I opened the front door to use a fire extinguisher to douse the flames, the flames shot out so high they melted the laminate surface of the kitchen cabinets above the counter where the toaster was located. Panasonic sent me a prepaid shipping sticker and sent the unit to their lab for investigation. The lab could not replicate the problem and they're sending this fire hazard back to me. They did comment on how clean I kept this unit. I will not be using this or any other infrared toaster. I'm thinking a crumb dropped on the light bar and spontaneously ignited. This technology isn't baked yet!"
1,Broil?,I sent this product as a gift and was surprised to learn that it doesn't appear to have the capacity to broil or top brown. Are we missing something? Does anyone have any suggestions?
3,"Great Toaster, but not for a Boat or RV","I bought this unit because it seemed to do the job on fewer watts than a standard toaster oven. I wanted to use it on my boat, running off of inverter power. No luck. Despite the fact that I have a pure sine wave inverter which successfully powers every other piece of electronic equipment on the boat, this toaster will just not run on inverter power. Panasonic tech support was not helpful (""It wasn't tested on inverter power"").This is particularly frustrating because I really like the unit. It makes great toast. I guess it will find a home in my home."
1,How much????????,"I know that we have owned ours for at last 10 years. I went to look for a new one and saw the price is $999.00, are you kidding me??????????? I know that we did not spend that much 10 years ago. Guess I will look for something I do not need to take a loan out on!!!!"
1,Arrived damaged,the product arrived damaged and i could not find a way to send it back. please advise how i can send this back a get a new oven
5,Most consistent toast you'll ever get,"You won't just get great, fast toast, you'll be able to reproduce the level of toastiness you like every time. Such is the benefit of a digital control panel. The infrared heating does an excellent job of getting food hot. I am concerned about the life of the tubes used to emit the infrared light, but it does have a 1 year warranty. Certainly I hope it lasts much longer than 1 year, but it beats the standard 90 day warranty. Shows that Panasonic has a little more faith in its product than some other companies.Having used my parents' toaster for half a year with great results, I'm now buying my own now that I'm moving out. It's the best toaster ever. Ever."
3,"Great toast, chintzy rack","This toaster makes very terrific toast. My only complaint is that the toasting rack inside the toaster doesn't attach firmly. It loosely hooks onto a sliding metal bar at the back that isn't attached to the unit, just balanced precariously between two slots on the inside walls. This bar falls out unless you open the door VERY CAREFULLY, and the back of the tray crashes to the toaster floor. This can be frustrating pre-coffee. Especially if the rack is already hot, but you would like to close the door again."
3,have to remember to shut off,"Toaster works very well but it should have an automatic shut off. Many times we have left the toaster on, which could be dangerous."
1,bad experienence,"I had this oven for 4 delightful weeks before the buttons quit working. The touch panel wasn't making contact with the back-end electronics. I finally unscrewed the whole panel in order to be able to squeeze the front and back at the same time. When it worked, the only downside was getting the inside clean. I was unable to get any cooperation with repairing it, from Amazon or from Panasonic. I gave it to a charity that repairs and resells junk."
5,replacing bulb/heater element,"I bought this back in '04 and it worked trouble free until about 2 weeks ago. I had trouble finding any info on the subject so I thought I'd repost this a few places for others who are having the same problem and haven't already thrown theirs out. I'm so happy to have my little oven back.I just replaced the bottom heater element on the Panasonic NBG100P. It's not welded to the metal strap just screwed in. There are two metal tabs I had to bend to slide the element out one one side but they bent back with no problem. I got the part here : ([...]) I don't know much about small appliances but it already wasn't working, so i figured I'd give it a shot. It does require a fair amount of disassembly, so if you're not that type of person maybe you shouldn't try it. Now it's back up and working like new. Yeah!! It also looks like the top heater element (not the infrared bulb that lights up) is the same part number."
1,Toy Oven,This supposed to be a toaster/OVEN; it is not. It is merely a glorified toaster. It is TOO SMALL to be anything else.
5,Very convenient and efficient and the kids like it,"This unit is a great replacement over my ancient B&D; one. Same footprint, a little taller, and has more internal room. It is very easy to use with preset buttons, regular oven temp and time, and toast time settings. The kids really like the way it ""lights up"" and it's easy to clean.I noticed that it produces a very dry heat. Little things like finger fish sticks and frozen bread can dry out quickly. Test with very little time, lower temperatures, or foil on top.This thing rocks!"
2,STOP! LOOK BEFORE YOU BUY,"I made the mistake of buying this toaster-oven based on the reviewers comments. This toaster-oven is good if all you want is an expensive toaster. It's not much good for anything else. The usable height inside is less than 3 1/2 inches. That's less than half the usable space of my GE toaster-oven, that I got for less money. This Panasonic has a very flimsy rack. There isn't enough room inside for a dinner plate. It's hard to clean. Don't cook anything that might splatter. Yes, it does cook faster, and it does not require preheating. But it only has 8 temperature settings that are 35 degrees apart, and the timer only goes to 25 minutes. The GE toaster-oven that I got can bake, broil, roast, rotisserie and toast. With the GE you can rotisserie a whole chicken! The GE has all non-stick coating inside, comes with 2 sturdy racks, 2 cookie sheets, the rotisserie spit, drip pan and broiler pan, for less money."
1,Not worth it to save $,"I thought this product would be a alright product and I would be able to save but its cheap and big it sticks out at my waist and is big, velcro is not a good thing for an ipod, and its hard to take out the suction cup broke after like a month of use, it sucks dont buy it unless your desperate, now I carry my ipod loose but im planning on buying a jamcase that is silicon and only cost about $20 and is the same size of the ipod so it doesnt bother in your pocket. but ive seen the official ipod belt case thats slim and doesnt bother at the waist, $50."
2,Sleek no more,"i just put my new ipod in this thing. my once sleek , cool looking mp3 player is now this big fat chunky thing in my pocket. i don't think belkin quite got the idea here. it attaches to the ipod with a plastic suction cup. that's laughable. it got two stars cause instead of one cause it does protect the ipod. i sure wish someone would make one that maintains the ""sleek"" though."
1,Kind of Defeats the Entire Purpose,"Got mine as a gift. Very thoughtful, but the design is terrible.It's huge, first of all. Therefore the whole ""my cool little iPod"" thing is completely lost.The design purposely conceals the controls, so you can't actually *use* the iPod.So you're walking down the street, someone stops you to ask for directions, and you can't pause the Audiobook, therefore losing your place and it's not like rewinding is all that easy, and you have to take the damn thing all apart just to get to it. AND THEN, because it's winter, you get snow all over it.What a terrible idea."
1,A waste of money,"I don't really understand the purpose of the case. There is no way to operate the iPod without opening the case, however the flap is tightly shut and it's a pain in the a-- to open it. It is also too large and heavy.Totally useless gadget.Rodan"
5,Great hanger that holds your boards securely,"I purchased a set of wood hangers that hold the board at about a 30 degree angle from the wall. I felt very uncomfortable with that rack, and ended up purchasing two sets of these strap hangers. Screw them into a wall stud, and they are pretty much foolproof. They do a great job of holding a board securely, and I don't think they would fall out even during an earthquake."
5,Exactly whatr I was looking for!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What else can I say besides the title. Snug against the wall so the wife doesn't mind, cheap, easy in and out and perfect!"
1,don't buy this product,this product does not work as said grommets pulled out on install so i used a washer and the material still came apart past the washer if left hanging my boards would have fallen.
3,Purchase Tertullian in Full in Phillip Schaff's Church Fathers Set,"This immense volume contains a good eighty-percent of Tertullian's writings; and it is fair to say that his best and most important ones will be found here as well, respectively. Now the remainder of his works are present in the second volume, which also has major writings from Origen and Minucius Felix. True, this particular volume is out of print, however it may be acquired in the complete thirty-eight volume set (Ante-Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers) compiled by Phillip Schaff near the turn of the ninteenth century. The set is somewhat outdated. The English translation is a bit archaic. But regardless of this, the collection is still used universally in the English speaking world as a source for the study of the Greek and Latin Fathers. And for the price ($350.) this series is definitely priceless. So if you are seeking to purchase Tertullian's complete corpus, please consider my referral."
4,excelent,"The music industry world ins an alien environment for most of the emerging artists and many need guidance to avoid scams and legal glitches, this book can be a good guide in defeating those lawyers that try to fool you into a deal. Despite the depth and professionalism , the book it isn't the best out there,” Music Business & Entertainment Law Contracts for Indie Recording Artist, Labels, Songwriters, Composers, Producers, Managers and All Others in the Record Industry. Binder / CD-ROM set (PC & Mac)"" by Ty Cohen is far better when dealing with all the aspects and it includes viewpoints from different men in the industry, and also includes clear and easy to understand examples"
4,Classic and funny,"A great series full of laughs and hidden comedy. Anyone who likes BBC will like this show, especially if you like Family Towers, or other similar tittles."
3,Mostly good,"For the most part this has worked flawlessly. But sometimes it seems to get to a state where the wireless will just stop working (computers connect connect to the network) until the unit is power cycled. I haven't tracked down the root cause here, but it might be heat; I found it got very hot and in the summer this seemed more prevalent -- it would happen multiple times a day.I plan to replace my unit with a Linksys WRT54G in the future."
3,Good Mystery,"Overall, I enjoyed reading ""Who Killed Blanche DuBois?"" but I felt the character of Meredith was a bit unrealistic. There were also a few other minor irritations in the book - some mis-spellings; two policemen in chapter 4 who stood ""behind the docket"" (look it up); and an error regarding Morgan horses - the man's name was Justin Morgan, not John, and a bit of web searching (took me all of three minutes) will show you that he did not breed the horse. The mystery itself was interesting enough to overcome these small shortcomings, and I plan to read the next in the series."
1,"Slow start, awkward middle ....","I read the first 14 chapters of this book with interest. The mystery plot was slow to develop, but the character was interesting enough to keep me involved.Then, suddenly, in Chapter 15, the point-of-view inexplicably changed from the main character to a very awkward omniscient point of view where we followed ""the murderer"" who, through an unbelievable set of convenient circumstances, stalked and killed another victim. At that point, I wanted to throw the book against the wall.My final analysis -- clumsily plotted, and enough manipulative and awkward segments to totally destroy any interest I had in the book. I skipped forward to see if I had been right when I predicted the killer, and found out I was.That isn't a good sign, either. I'm usually wrong.Obviously, your mileage may vary."
3,OPI Lincoln Park,I just used this product last night and found it most difficult. The polish is very thick and globs up on the brush. I added a couple of drops of paint thinner and it remained thick and globby. Not sure what to do next. I do like the color.
1,doesnt come out to the color in the picture,"the picture color is very misleading!the first coat comes out as streaky but a beautiful plumy color! but the second coat makes it turn into almost an indistinguishable black-purple! if it kept that plum color, it would have received a 5 star, but unfortunately it didnt ):be cautious if you are planning to buy this product!"
2,Disappointing polish :(,"I had heard so much about this color, and how it is a must-have.So I was very excited when I received it, but it quickly changed when I put the polish on my nail.Application was pretty bad for me: very thick polish, almost gluey. It was streaky and really hard to get a good coverage because it wouldn't flow on the nail.I had to use 2 coats, and after the second coat the polish was so dark you could barely see the purple. You would have thought it was just a black polish.After the second coat the texture was fine, but I am still disappointed.I will try again and update my review if I change my mind, but I don't think i will."
5,Smooth DARK plum makes fruity fingers.,"Great nail polish. I'm really loving this brand! When used with a nice base coat and top coat, I've found this polish to be smooth, even, and easy to apply as well as durable. I'm the poster of the first customer image. The color is a very deep plum and is subtle and even difficult to see the hue in all but ideal indoor or natural lighting. A sexy and classy color. Make sure to apply all the way to the tip as I noticed a tiny bit of shrinkage after drying (not tip wear). Highly recommended!"
3,Love the color that this REALLY is.,The picture is not of Lincoln Park After Dark. The real polish is dark and gorgeous. So not the same. I got the real color so I'm not mad.
4,Pretty good read,"This book was a pretty good read, especially about JonBenet Ramsey. I skipped the chapter on O.J. Simpson. The cases are interesting and especially the chapter on Mr. Berdella, another Jeffrey Dahmer, he even died in prison, like Dahmer, but of a heart attack. It's pretty macabre. I wouldn't buy the book, but got it from the library this time. It was okay, not great, but okay."
2,Dissappointing perspective of the cases,"I was expecting this book to provide a detailed account and complete involvement in the cases depicted. It was dissappointing to note that a lot of the information is just speculation based on newspaper articles and journalism sources (including tabloids), which undermine the impartiality and quality of the evidence presented in the book. Still, the narrator reviews and explains autopsy reports and photography, which is more than a normal reader can understand or access for himself. The author was marginally involved in some of the cases, and as such can only provide limited insight into the what actually happened. If you expect an absolute and unavoidable truth, this is not the book. If you want to read the opinion of an expert regarding famous cases, then this book might help."
2,And Racist too,"Her parents were indeed revolting.. and it is perhaps instructive to be assured again that all families were not invented by Norman Rockwell. But did she need to do her own revolting racist screed against gypsies to excuse her grandmother's behavior? Not the parents opinion, but her. Quite nasty."
1,Not too helpful,"Was trying to write a mumps interpreter. This book ended up being not so useful. Early in the book, he has a completely wrong definition of ""bootstrap loader."" This bothered me, because mumps is such an old language, you would think someone that knows mumps would know about the meaning of that phrase. In any case, I believe the author knows Mumps completely, but I did not find the book energizing or inspiring."
5,by far the best juicer for the $$$,"Two reasons why this juicer is the best out there...1) it presses or masticates the vegetable or fruit, rather than centrifugally cutting them, thus preserving vital nutrients in the process (kind of defeats the point of juicing when you're killing the enzymes before you're given a chance to ingest them like the centrifugal juicers do) and 2) by comparison to the omega juicer(it's cousin), it's cheaper, looks the same, and does the exact same thing. and a few extra perks include very easy clean up (probably one of the better in this department), the luxury of making your own nut butters, it's ability to juice wheatgrass, and the fact that it's quieter than most juicers, especially the centrifugal ones. have fun. fully recommend."
2,Don't recommend,"I have been making vegetable juices for more then 10 years. Samson GB-9001 is the most expansive juice maker I ever bought. Yet it is the less efficient juice extractor I ever had. I would not even call it a juice extractor. It is more like a grinder. The amount of juice it extracts is scanty. My old juice extractor, I bought 10 years ago for 45 dollars, extracts twice as much juice."
3,sterling silver pill bracelet,"The clasp gets caught on your clothes and opens up so you can lose the pill inside. Good news is, it is a nice looking bracelet. I have received many compliments on it however I did want to keep a pill in it. That is why I purchased such a piece."
4,360 Strategy Games,"As far as real time strategy games go, there are very few for consoles, but this game, to me, is better quality and has more options available than many expensive, High Power PC games. I would recommend Lord of the Rings, Battle for Middle Earth 2 for anyone with an Xbox 360 looking for a game that will make you think on the run!"
5,Just a fun game u can't put down,"Hey i've had this game for about a month now, and i play it regularly, and its just crazy fun, because you can go online, or set up a skirmish game with the computer, or play the campaign, which has 2 parts a good and evil. once u start playing this game u will not want to put it down. some people say that these kinds of games(RTS) are only ment for computer, but the layout and the feel of this game is amazing, and u just get hooked. if u are looking for a fun game to play this is for u!"
1,Lord of the rings xbox game,"[...].The game itself is not fun at all, I expected it to be similar to the PS2 lord of the rings games.....not at all. Not worth the money."
3,Good Game but not a true strategy game,"This game has good graphics and gameplay but I was overall disappointed. After the first couple of levels the game just seems very repetitive. I actually quite playing it because it became boring. I love strategy games and this one misses the mark. If you are looking for a quick playing strategy with no strategy needed, this is the game for you."
5,Husband and son both enjoy,"Both avid gamers, they both enjoyed this game. When I buy a game and then either one plays every night and they talk strategy at dinner, I know it's one they really like."
3,MULTIPLAYER HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN,"I would like to warn everybody before purchasing this from here or another site that the multiplayer on this has been shut down by EA a couple months ago. So if you're buying this for the multiplayer, don't bother. You'll only get to play single player.Aside from that, it's actually a pretty good game, similar to Halo Wars, only more complex and detailed. I've always been told to avoid video games based off of movies or tv shows but this is certainly one of the exceptions. If they still had multiplayer on, I would give it a 4 to 4 1/2 rating. However, without multiplayer, which was the main driving force behind my purchase, I can only fairly give this a 3 star rating."
3,good but lacking,overall it wasnt bad but it wasnt that great either. The freeform kinda mode is pretty boring and way to easy but the game is saved by the story portion of it. there are definatly better strategy games out there especialy on pc.
3,Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth II,"This game plays out like Civilization 3. You control groups of peasants, troops, hero's, and other beasts as you build, destroy, plunder, and conquer your way across various maps. It's all top-down view and some of the controls feel... awkward with the 360 controller. I'm not saying that any other console controller would feel better, but I think this game should have been left for play on the PC with the use of the Mouse and Keyboard.I was hoping this game would play out more like the older LOTR games for (original)Xbox. That 3rd person view made for lots of fun as you commanded your character through harrowing tasks. I was really looking forward to bringing that style of play to life with the great graphics of the 360. Not so... Boo urns..."
1,The item on sale is a copy of the 1974 edition,"It is true that the Shore Protection Manual is an invaluable resource for coastal engineers. However, the item on sale is a copy of the 1973 edition - even though the copyright says 2001. Therefore this volume is missing a lot of the information contained in the 1984 edition."
5,The Godfather of GO GO,"Funky! Rocking! Crankin! Yeah shawty! This is one CD to have during rush hour traffic . . . all my DC Metro people understand . . . South Capitol Street Bridge, Woodrow Wilson Bride, Route 50 New York Avenue . . . Rockin! Especially the gospel joint . . . Can't nobody do me like Jesus!!! Buy 5 copies man! Don't burn this one. Support home!!!"
5,RIP to the Godfather of GoGo,"Chuck Brown was the truth and a Pioneer of the DC GO GO sound and he was more than that, this Cat could combine alot of styles and he would free style on you and also his cover versions of songs were the sickness. very talented Musician and this compilation is long overdue. he truly throws down and always gave you a show. he had a distinctive tone on Guitar and his voice as well. a Great overview. RIP. Prayers to his family, friends and fans worldwide."
1,Quit Here,"Don't get me wrong- this series won't find a place in any Top 10 Lists or anything, but it was readable compared to some other things I've read.This book is the exception. For anything this book was terrible, let alone the end of a series. Even though I had just finished the previous book, I was a bit lost on this one. The themes seemed totally different, it didn't match up with the rest of them.If you like the other books, just stop after Desolation Angels, or get this at the library. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,WASTE OF $$$ AND TIME,This rag was a self-published collection of amateur poetry that reads like it was written by a class of pre-pubesent junior high schoolers. Your time and money would be better spent reading the walls of a public pay toilet.
4,"Great information for playing a ""unicorn""","While taking place in the dark ages, the information on the Salubri is far better than what you'll find in any of the other Vampire books. Most of the information explains the attitudes of the Salubri towards their fellow (and rival) clans as well as exactly what goes into the background of one of these enigmatic vampires. Also, the clan's history and possible ties to the (literally) demonic Baali clan are presented as well. I found it to be a great source for even modern characters, as the attitude of defending and healing the weak hasn't really gone out of style. Now, if they'd only come out with a modern-day clanbook."
4,Always wanted to know more about these guys,These are one of the most powerful clans in vampire the Masquerade. But they have been small in numbers for so long that you have to go back to the dark ages to be one. This book has a very good background story for the salubri. Lets you in a few sercrets never before heard of until this was released.
3,Definately on tha top,"I'm gonna have to get this book sometime. I have always been intrested in the smaller clans; salubri, cappadocian, and kiasyd are all real cool.By the old rules there are only 8 salubri alive at a time but now since they are part of the sabbat I'm not sure. I have read through the Book of Nod and I don't remember the passage from the previous reviewer but it did talk about saulot being baal's brother and betraying him to Cain when he started his demon worshipping.Ohh well I hope they come out with a revised Salubri book."
5,Management of Countertransference With Borderline Patients,"This is the most helpful paper or book I have read on working with ""borderline"" clients. I am not fond of DSM lablels. While the authors are writing from a theoretical orientation different from my own, the information is clear and theory independent.They appear to have a magnificent command of the literature on this subject and make complex concepts clear. Most importantly they describe practical ways for the therapist not to lose themselves when dealing with clients most likely to hook the therapist."
1,should be rated one half star,This book does contain nuggets of good advice but they are buried under tons of self-involved verbiage.The author's obvious knowledge of cruise travel is bogged down with overly verbose language that makes reading it a chore rather than a pleasure. On a more positive note the photographs are interesting and the title catches the eye.The book is not helpful to first-time cruisers or those looking for an easy read.
1,Don't purchase from this Seller!!,"I purchased Dreamweaver CS3 from the seller,ljc_establishment. The serial number on the software package was not recognized by Adobe as a valid number. I notified the seller who proceeded to email a total of 5 serial numbers to try. None of them were accepted by Adobe. At this point I asked for a refund. I received approval to mail the copy back to ljc_establishment which I did, requesting a turn around time for the refund. That's the last time I heard from the seller after numerous attempts to communicate."
1,I am filing a federal lawsuit against this seller and Amazon,I am filing a federal civil complaint (diversity jurisdiction) against this seller and against Amazon if he and Amazon do not refund my money.
1,Piss Poor Service on an Obsolete Product,"Even after repeated attempts to contact the seller and Amazon.com, no response or Valid Serial Number (required for activation) were ever given. I don't think I will ever order anything from Amazon again. Adobe would not stand behind their product either. The worst buying experience ever!"
1,"musicshoppe3 third-party seller, invalid serial numbers","I bought this software from musicshoppe3, a market-seller at Amazon, in 2008.The software worked fine at first. I was able to register it with Adobe, as far as I can recall. Two years later, in 2010, I tried to reinstall the software and to re-register it with Adobe, but this time around I was told that the serial number was fake. I tried to contact the seller, but I have not received any reply. I knew, of course, that the warranty for this software had long expired; but its defect (it being a counterfeit) became known only 2 years after I bought it.I asked Amazon for help, but I also have not received any response from Amazon. It seems to me that Amazon is condoning sellers who are selling counterfeit softwares at Amazon.com."
1,dreamweaver,"This was a counterfeit product with a bogus activation and serial number out of shanghai, china. i was refunded the money but the of course lost the time."
4,Makes Web design easy,I enjoyed working with Dreamweaver CS3. It was easy to understand and made Websight developement easier than code.
2,AAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH,"Having been forced by Mr. Bill Gates's disastrous Windows Vista rollout to upgrade from my previous version of Dreamweaver, with which I was pretty happy, I am encountering nothing but anger, frustration and dissatisfaction with Adobe over CS3. At the moment I am jumping through their hoops trying to get tech help through their labyrinthine online support, and am just about finished before I have even gotten started. The product itself is fine for the task; too bad about their evasive and infuriating disinclination toward support. Aargh aargh aargh."
4,Powerful but where's the manual?,"This is a strong update. Since Adobe bought Macromedia, DW works best with their products. Powerful, nicely laid out, and fairly intuitive, but I wish it had a manual. Had to buy a ""Missing Manual"" book, which I highly recommend as an auxiliary reference.Overall, DW retains its title as king (or queen) of web development software."
1,Terribad,"This software is slower and a little more glitchy than Macromedia Studio 8.If you're using Studio 8 there's no real compelling reason to upgrade. It's throwing away money, IMO. Flash CS3 seems to be a great product so far however."
4,A Quality Product,"I've been using Dreamweaver for several years now. Overall it's a quality product. The only issue I have with it is its FTP connectivity. At times the connectivity is efficient at others it seems to need to reestablish its connection causing downtime. However, this may not be a result of the software itself but rather an ISP issue. In either case, it's probably the best product on the market."
4,Yessss!,"All of dissopointed fans of the past, take note. This album brings back memories from the old days. The drumming is simply amazing, very fast and tight. Vocals are good, though do not compare to Slylvain Houdes' style, (but who does?) This is deffinitely worth a listen, not Temple of Knowledge Kataklysm, but blows Victoms away."
4,Full of Surprises,"All the songs on this album may not jump out as favorites the first time around, but by listen #2 I had many favorites. As said before, don't expect Pearl Jam. I don't know why people buy solo albums expecting Pearl Jam. But if you want something different, and you liked Stone's vocals on ""Mankind"" (No Code) this may be a good choice.Many of the songs have interesting suprises, layers of sounds and are emotionally charged. ""Pigeon"" is a clever hard rocker with edgy lyrics, and ""Anchors"" and ""Bayleaf"" are sad and beautiful. Whoever said there was no effort put into this album was sadly mistaken. I'm already hooked and think this is a wonderful album."
4,Good Action !,"Steven Seagal is what in his fifties, and he still kicks [butt]. This movie is a great action movie. Even though there are some scenes that show a seagal double, and some stunts were done by someone else, the fighting scenes are all him. I recommend this movie to Steven Seagal fans."
2,Not Too Good.,Since Half Past Dead wasn't too bad one might think that some of the other later Seagal films might be okay as well. Think again. This film was very hard to follow and was totally uninteresting. The only reason it's getting a two is because the next film by the same director Out for a Kill is actually worse than this one! Seagal just looks awful. He actually looks ill and for some reason it sounds like a voice double is used sometimes instead of Seagal. The acting was uneven some of the actors were better than others. The film uses a lot of slow motion probably just to extend the mess of a film to 90 minutes.
3,about the movie the foreigner.......,"The story is about the package where lots of people are looking for it. Stories of this type will definitely contain actions and if you want a very good story out of it, that's too bad. For action a rating of 4 is given and story base is only a rating of three. This movie is not allowed to be screened or even sold in Singapore as it contains one scene where the prisoner is badly treated by the poland military even though the actions are good."
1,"""I have high expectations for this movie""","To the guy above me:Why would you give 5 stars to a movie you have not seen?What a career Steven Segal has had. He went from relative unknown to big budget action star in a relatively short amount of time. It's unfortunate that ""The Foreigner"" will serve as one of the final nails in his coffin, so to speak. This is a huge mess, with a run-of-the mill action storyline, and stereotypical villains... just like every Steven Segal movie since ""Under Seige.""Avoid this pile of garbage, unless you can't get enough of bad action movies.You don't want this movie. It's bad. Really bad. But hey, if you plan on having a ""Drunken Movie Night"" with your close friends, and need something bad to watch so you can collectively mock it, then this may be worth a rental. Otherwise, save yourself some money here, and treat yourself to something nice. C'mon, you deserve it."
2,Typical but not horrible,"Well i will say this movie stunk but i won't say it was all that horrible,much better than the rediculous Out for a Kill,uhh didnt we already have OUT for justice?Anyhow this is the typical package delivery,look out bad guy's,big conspiracy movie.Yes is pretty bad but it could have been a lot better,spice up the plot and instead of Steven using ALL gun's in this movie,let him use his much skilled martial arts talent.This is backwards,take all the fighting from Out for a Kill and put it here and it would be so much better.Oh well can't win them all,and by the way give up the cheesy new age music,and slow motion reverse fighting shots,let the man just fight for god sakes."
2,YOUR AVERAGE SEAGAL MOVIE,"A MAN TRYS TO DELIVER A PACKAGE TO SOME RICH GUY. BUT, A WHOLE LOTTA PEOPLE TRY TO INTERCEPT THE DELIVERY. A FEW GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES HERE AND THERE, BUT MOST OF THIS MOVIE IS HARD TO WATCH. STEVEN SEAGAL DOESN'T LOOK AS COOL AS HE USED TO, BUT THIS MOVIE IS REALLY HARD TO STOMACH. DIEHARD FANS OF SEAGAL SHOULD LOVE IT. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD ACTION MOVIE, DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME. THIS MOVIE HAS SOME DUMB VILLAINS. DESPITE MANY OPPORTUNINTIES TO KILL SEAGAL, NO ONE EVER JUMPS AT THE CHANCE. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND MISS THIS ONE. YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING SPECIAL."
2,Yawn,"You could be forgiven after 15 minutes of this movie for opting for some emergency dental work without anesthesia as a substitute, as it is probably the worst Steven Seagal offering to date. This movie is already being aired on network television, which gives you some idea of the kind of draw (and audience) the producers were expexting to attract. Seagal spends most of the movie clad in black (to hide his ever expanding bulk) and plays a government agent(yawn) who is double crossed and has to save the day, kill all the baddies, and exact revenge on his employers. Formula nonsense with plenty of gratuitous violence, bone crunching fight scenes, and acting performances straight out of the box (cardboard that is). Somebody needs to tell Mr Seagal to call it a day!"
1,What a load of rubbish,"Hi my name is Lloyd Duff and I think this film needs to be thrown off a very high cliff. I like Steven Seagal and I am aware that he is in his 50's and cant do his karate like he used to. The story is he is suposed to deliver a package from Poland to go knows where for a rich dude. Most of the film is about his parnter going around pointlessy shooting people who have nothing to do with the movie. Was he mental? Why shoot the old porsche guy at berlin airport? yet help an old womon at the farm? Was he jeaulous of him? of his charming good looks? He could have just Drove away leaving the guy swearing in german and throwing his turino flatcap to to ground and screaming out ""hoodlum"" WHY MURDER HIM? He could have had money in his briefcase"
1,A Dissapointment,"It is a shame to see what Steven Seagal has been reduced to. His claim to action fame was his martial arts and there is hardly any in this movie. Instead there is senseless shooting. Unbelievable gun fight scenes. Like the one where he walks through and army of body guards on an estate and kills them all. Or the one where he kills a man shooting at him with a machine gun with one shot while not even looking. I had not heard of this movie when it was a theatrical release and now I see why. It must not have hung around long.The movie made vain attempts at intrigue and deception but only succeeded in confusion. It was a dissapointment and you would do well to chose another movie. Unless of course you are a die hard fan of his that thinks he can not make a bad movie, ever. This one is headed ..."
3,Source of Atomic footage,"A lot of the Atomic Bomb footage seen in ""24 Hours After Hiroshima"" came from ""Trinity and Beyond"" which is available on blu-ray from Amazon.Trinity and Beyond - the Atomic Bomb Movie [Blu-ray]"
5,The Legacy Of War,"Difficult to watch, but essential too. The main documentary focuses primarily on the immediate time around the dropping of the bomb from multiple points of view, both Japanese and American, and the first person recounting makes it all the more worthwhile. The second documentary, a history of the development and spread of atomic and nuclear weapons, is more clinical in its approach, but also frightening in the prospect of nukes getting into the wrong hands... if they're not already there."
5,Another home run by Netgear.,"An excellent product for connecting a small office network. No hassles, no problems. Just a nice clean simple solution to network sharing."
1,Short Life span,After countless hours of troubleshooting and replacing my DSL with Cable Modem service I found that this Netgear 16 port switch was the problem. It worked good for about 1.5 years then crapped out. It started with constantly dropping VPN connections then just got worse from there. If you only are using this switch for about a year then buy it; If you expect it last longer forget it. This also happened with a 16 port dlink i purchases prior to this one. You get what you pay for.
1,port failure,bought this product for my small business. after about 8 months ports started failing. i only have 9 inputs. and its a good thing because i only have 9 working ports of the 16. this morning one of those failed. you do not want this for production work. better to get cisco. you get what you pay for. this is cheap chinese junk.
5,Great product,"Netgear has become what Linksys was: a price performer. Great experience with this product so we bought a second one to use as a backup in an office where we have all sorts of switches. As the Linksys devices fail, we've been replacing them with Netgear and are much happier."
2,ho hum,I guess this was my fault. I thought the lights would blink in front of the hub. but the lights blink where the wiring is plugged in. looks like crap. most switchers plug in from behind and blink in front. guess thats why it was so cheap.
1,Seller Good. Product Not Good.,tried this as a cheaper solution for the Netgear JGS516. did not operate well at all. unit locked up multiple times. would not purchase again. Seller was perfect. product arrived as promised. Not sellers fault product is horrible.
1,Burned out!!!!!!!!!,It burned out with the smell of burning plastic. The unit was very hot. I have had it for one year!!!
5,"Great little, no-frills, ethernet switch!","We replaced three old 10-baseT hubs with the Netgear FS116 and our network has not only been MUCH faster, but seems to have a whole lot less trouble.It does everything we need it to do and does it well. We have generally been very happy with other Netgear products we have used.The FS116 is small, affordable, and works great. What more could you want?"
4,"deeds done in darkness, this book brings into the light","The author unfortunatly prooves the case for Fr Ernetti, whom I believe was a brilliant and holy person, At the end of the book does his best to discredit him. The author may have been pressured to change the tone as the powers that be do not want this information mainstream."
3,intriguing and provocative but requires better evidence,"This book reports what is probably the most striking case of linguistic (and other) information allegedly arising out of time travel or at least the viewing of past events. It involves the `Chronovisor', a mid-C20 invention by Ernetti which supposedly allowed observation (not participation) of past events. The author, Peter Krassa, has also written a largely positive biography of Erich von Daniken. An important piece of evidence involves a lengthy, previously unrecorded passage in Latin, around 10% of a play of which we know but which is largely lost. However, the text has been examined by a classical scholar, and there are anachronisms. In addition, the clustering in this passage of a high proportion of the surviving minor fragments is suspicious. Without better evidence, this must be the verdict on the entire story as well (although if the text really is a hoax someone proficient in Latin took a lot of trouble faking it!)."
1,Interesting for about a second,"I first of heard of this book when I heard the author on a radio show talk and made the book sound interesting but after reading this book I wish I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and skipped this book. This book shows a whole lot of nothing of the so called chronovizor with a bunch of tid bit informaion making you think maybe a chronovizor is possible. '' what ever skip this book at all costs, a total waste of time."
3,"Fairly interesting, but utterly limp","This book posits an amazing notion from its first page: why did Father Ernetti, known for his studiousness and utter honestly, announce to the Vatican that he'd invented a time machine? And for that matter, why did the Vatican corroborate his announcement as fact before covering it up and pretending it'd never occurred?Pity that the book never truly takes a stand on its findings, however. It presents a series of facts, interviews, ideas, and thoughts, many of which contradict each other, and lets the reader interperet them as they wish. In the end, the reader is no more educated on the subject than when they began, and perhaps a bit more confused."
4,Nice motor- But not for a Crib Mobile,I can't really give this poor feedback because it seems nice enough and worked when I put a battery in it. The only problem is that I purchased it for a handmade crib mobile and it spins around like a ride at a amusement park. It's quite fast! Probably perfect for your disco ball.
2,Does not last very long!,This product works for a while then the motor goes out..you cant put anything heavy on the spinner...the motor stops working even faster. Wish I could find a spinner that is better built and lasts longer.
1,Junk,"Looks like it was constructed in a 4th grade shop class. Cheap plastic, pieces rattling around inside, switch loose and barely held on by sloppy glue job, exposed wires, and a big screw head for the battery contact. And, it simply didn't work. It didn't work. No power, no motor, no spinning. $10 bucks down the drain. Stay away."
2,Black Rotating Motor,"The product was reasonably inexpensive and it is not worth that price. Within a week of using the motor the switch doesn't work properly. I turn the switch on and nothing happens. In order to get the motor to start rotating I have to manually rotate the shaft of the motor, it works fine after that but I don't think it was designed that way."
3,"Seller is great, product, not so.",We have purchased several of these from various sources. They work great as long as:1. The switch holds out. We've had alot of problems with the switches.2. Don't use them outside in inclement weather. They really aren't made for outdoor use.This last one we bought from Earthwind lasted only two weeks before the switch gave out. Earthwind sent us TWO new ones! A great company to do business with.
2,Battery operated rotating motor,"I bought 2 of these battery operated motors for outdoor wind decorations. Within 1 week, the first one had ceased up and would not run again. I am on the second one already and lord only knows how long it will last. I am very disappointed in this product."
4,Good motor,"Great little battery powered motor. Spins my 12"" mirror ball with no issue. The wire clip is really weak and will have to be changed before adding anything with weight."
2,two worked one did not,I bought three of these and two worked one did not.the new D cell Alkaline battery I installed lasted about 24 hours of continuous operation.I returned the motors because I thought they were solar powered instead of battery powered.
3,works well,"We've enjoyed watching the wind spinners turn using the rotating motor. We don't leave it on for long, but every time our granddaughters are over the give them lots of viewing pleasure."
3,spins too fast,Arrived promptly however the motor spins the discoball way too fast. it should be a slow steady spin - not one that makes you dizzy.
4,Rotating Motor for wind chime!,This product does it's job very well. It is not too attractive and the batteries don't last too long but I have been very pleased with it. My wind spinner would not have looked so good withoutthis motor.
1,"Rotates to fast,","no way to control speed, would have been nice if it was more controllable. Also cheaply made and breaks easily when trying to replace battery"
5,Wind Spinner help,"This motor helps show off my Duke wind spinner.The Red Carpet Rotateing motor,is what I expected it to be.Much needed."
4,Fun Spider-Man Game for a Handheld,"This is a fun game for the Nintendo DS, a must-have for any devoted Spidey fan. Note, though, that the game doesn't really take advantage of the DS's dual-screen or other very special features, but at least the graphics is FANTASTIC, nothing you've seen on a handheld before. The animation is silk-smooth and this really helps put you in the right mood playing as Spidey. The game follows a familiar action plot as the movie, and you got ample opportunity to kick butts.Great graphics and fun gameplay make this a decent title for the DS. The price might be a bit too high for people not into spider-man. I also wish they had used the lower screen better."
3,Spider man 2,"Spider man 2 is a decent game! It has some weak graphics, but fun play. There are neat skills to learn, and good boss fights. Now, I did not like the touch screen didn't play a big role. I would have liked so touch screen action, but not there. Also, it's hard to see where your going! you could web sling up a wall and hit some fire and hurt yourself. Ok game. You should pick it up!"
3,not the best,"a few good things:-good graphics-many unlockables-easy controls-good use of the touch screena few bad things:-when an ememy hits you, you have to do spidy sense to escape-annoyingly hard levels, unless you are a game master-kind of hard boss battlesif you have patience, and are good at video games, this game is worth buying. if not, maybe you should rent it."
3,This gameis really hard,When I got this game for easter i was really happy because I thought it was just like the ps2 one but I was wrong ... It is sooo much harder to beat the bad guys and to recsuce all the people frome the burning building I still never beat the first level because I cant find the secret unlock This game wasnt all that fun because it was just so hard
3,Uhh! Okay Game!,I expected a little more of the game. It feels like a 3D game but with 2D play! I guess I got used to playing the Gamecube version and was expecting almost the same port. But the game does have great graphics. The controls could be a little better. This game has some replay value.
3,,The game is quite a game actually u can use different moves accessed by the touch screen. For some reason this game is a little pricier and it isnt quite one of ds's best games. i wouldnt recommend spending money on this game until uve tried the other games first but if ur an expert gamer and just wanna test this game out give out 40 bucks and give it a test try.
2,Meh...,"I got this game in a bundle when the DS first came out. I could only play it for about an hour before I couldn't stand anymore of the drek. The gameplay reminded me of one of the old cheepo side scrolling NES games that where out pumped by the gallon in the day. The graphics are good, and the controls where OK, but after that it's mostly down hill. The goofy bare-bone story has little to do with the movie. The gameplay has rudimentary goals, rescue the hapless citizens, and beat the boss, get new unimpressive power, rinse repeat. The sound effects and music where also had a similar lack luster quality, feeling quite basic. Since I never finished the game and played only 3 levels I cannot say if it gets better, but why would I want to torture myself to find out."
3,What's with all the side scrolling games?,"I'm going to make my review short and to the point. DS's graphics are way better than what's shown here. DS should leave sidescrolling games in the dust. On the positive side, it was a fun and challenging game. The boss fights were good with some touch screen action--not as much as I hoped--that I thought was fun. Bottom line: O.K. game. If you have every game worth getting for the DS get this. Otherwise, get a different game."
2,Spider-loser 2,"Oh gees, another DS game with no touch-screen. A big disappointment. Spider-man 2 blows. The lack of fighting and touchy ""web slinging"" moves kind of draws you out of the game. An with no map it's hard to see where you are going without flying into fire or a thug. Don't waste your time... better yet, avoid the DS. Only 16 games. Only 5 use the touchscreen. You can kiss nintendo goodbye now that the PSP is on the market with 26 games."
3,Its more like a 3.5,"I got this game for my nintendo ds, I guess I will start with the pros. If your looking for a 2D scroller this would be it, the graphics are 3D but its a 2d scroller and the graphics are detailed and look some what like nintendo 64 graphics.There are tons of level so it will last awhile. Now for the cons, Its overpriced Its $40. I would wait intell its at least $30, the control at times can get pretty hard, and it ignores the touch screen feature besides looking at pointless data, and as no mulitplayer at all. If your craving for a 2d scroller for the ds I guess you mit look into getting the game. But if you just want a game look somewere besides this game."
3,VERY FRUSTRATING,"If you have little or no patience then do not get this game. Like on the 3rd level you have to get to the lab in 6 minutes while saving 12 people and getting 12 muggers. They are really hard to find when you get to the end of the level and dont have all of the muggers and people you have to go back and look. Then there is no chance of beating the level. And the fighting style is wack, because if you dont go into the spider sense then he will keep hitting you and not let you get away or hit him back. But if you go into the spider sense then you waste a lot of time because the clock does not slow down with the spider sense. I only reccomend this game to ages 12 and up because it is really hard."
3,"The Bets Graphics Game on the Ds, but too hard","I ahd gift cards so i bought this game. It is very ahrd especially the first level. it makes you very stresed out because you hear the same music track over and over again, besides it being a hard game.I would reccomend to spiderman fans or people looking for a game that already have mario.madden, & tiger woods It has great graphics though"
4,hard...fun....amazing grafics...,WOW i never thought a hand held game would have grafics like these...AMAZING...but this game is hard...and i mean hard when i say hard...like puting it down for a couple of days because your so freakin mad at it...but i would recommend geting it if your up for a challenge
4,You Should Get This,You should get this only if you consider yourself a gamer. This is a hard game in which my friends get mad because it is so hard. It isn't really hard if your a gamer like me. If you play it a lot it will get quite easy. I personaly think you should get it.
2,I expected more...,"I'm a gamer. that's all there is to it. I saw this game at target and then wasted 39 bucks on it. this game is cruddy. it's gameplay is rather slow, and 2-D. Really i expected more. the ds is capaple of so much, with the added help of the touch screen. you start out with 3 special abilitys, and it's imposible to get more, exept with cheats. Then i saw the PSP version, and i was stunned. All i want is to save you people from wasting 30 bucks. Might i reccomend Rayman DS."
4,kind of dispointing,I thought this game was going to be great. It was a liottle bit of a let down. Frist the game is very hard. Like the level maps are so big that its very hard to find people that you have to rescue! Then when you get to the boss its all easy. The grafics are ok i thought they would be better. This game was hard and will take a long time to beat like the timed level.scale of 1-10Grafics 6Fun 7control 9Diffcalty levels 10Diffcalty boss 4
1,Dont buy this,I bought this game and at first I thought it was kind of cool. The graphics were all right as well as the sound. But on the second level of the game I can never find all the people. Maybe there is a glitch in the game or something but I have tried again and again and i cant find that last person. So basically this game is a waste of money. If someone knows how to get past this please post another review telling everyone.
3,Medicore,The Missions are really hard so it takes a while to beat a lvl. Also there is no map so it takes a long time 2 get anywhere. The one on gamecube is 3 times better the touch screen is used for this special move thing which stinks. DO NOT GET THIS GAME it is horrible. I can't even get past lvl 3.
2,Fun for a while,"I bought this game thining it would be 3D. I half to admit I cand only play rated E games. So I can play Spiderman1 for my gamecube and the graphics are great. When I buought spiderman(2) for Ds I thought the graphics would be something like 3rd person view. The back ground graphics 3D but Spidy can only go left, right and jump. Your view is to the side of him.Now something positive. The gameplay is pretty fun though there is verry little use for the touch screen.My final point is I wouldnt buy it for over $20."
1,OMG,"I think this is the worst movie I've ever watched, if I can say I watched it since fast forwarded 90% of it. Bad plot, bad acting, bad direction, bad everything..."
1,Too oily and lacks flavor,"I had high hopes for this product when I first opened the package because the noodles had a great texture and the sauce looked appealing. The food was easy to prepare at my workplace. However to me, the taste was very oily and flavorless. I'm a big peanut satay fan and was expected more spice in the flavor."
4,Really Good,"""It tastes better than it looks"" was the first thing I said the a skeptical co-worker looking at my peanut satay as it came out of the microwave. Unfortunately, it's as fattening as it looks, so I likely won't be purchasing it often. I could see this mixing with chicken or beef and tasting even better though!"
3,Not Real Peanut Satay,"This is NOT real peanut satay but for the price it is not bad. I like to get these and keep them in my desk at work for the days that I don't have time to go out to lunch. These are really easy to make; just mix together the cooked noodles and the bag of sauce and microwave for about 2 minutes. You will not get a restaurant quality meal out of this but it is decent for just over $2.00 a box. The box says it is 2 servings but if you are not mixing in any meat or anything, it really is only 1 serving."
1,Made nothing for me,"The product didn't help my acne at all! I've been dealing with acne for 21 years and still look for a way to get rid of it! After reading all the reviews here I decided to buy this product, but it did not work on my acne. Oh, well, each person is a person and the bodies will respond in different way to the same treatment. I wish good luck to whom it my interested."
1,"discontinued, old product","Perhaps it's my own fault for not doing thorough research, but I was so excited to find an at home peel kit that I snatched this up! The products have an odd odor, and none of them ""tingle"" as explained in the instructions and unfortunately did not help my skin at all. Later, I discovered this product has been discontinued."
1,Why all the good reviews?,"I have been struggling with acne for 4-5 years and have tried a handful of products. I thought I would give this one a try because it had received so many positive reviews, and the price was right so I thought it would be worth a shot.Nope! After 3 weeks I see absolutely no difference. If anything my skin may even be more irritated. I made sure to follow the directions exactly as on the label but to no effect.Maybe these work for some, but they certainly didn't for me which is disappointing. I tried it for both facial and back acne to no response. Time to try something else."
2,Acne Peel,"Worked OK, but not great. I found that Neutrogena's Oil-free acne cleanins is much better."
5,It Works!!!,I have tried everything I can (including Proactive) to clear my skin. This stuff is great. I found it at Target and figured that it couldn't hurt to try. It worked amazingly!! Within a few days my skin was almost completely cleared up! This product works even better when used with the L'OREAL Severe Acne kit (it's the blue trimmed box).
1,Seriously?,The product came already opened so I'm not sure if I want to expose my skin to this. Very disappointed in the delivery. The moisturizer looked as if was already used.
1,Doesnt help but increase redness,I have used this since last month and it doesnt really help the breakout. But it made my face redness more serious than before. I personally don't recommend this product.
2,Didn't work for me.,"This system did not do anything for me. After many weeks of having no success, I tried applying Benzoyl-Peroxide after the 3rd step. Aftwards, I noticed a big improvement in the effectiveness, but I don't know if it was the combination of these two or just the benzoyl acting alone. In any case, I'm sure any sacrylic acid and benzoyl mixture would work just as well. I don't like using benzoyl-peroxide, b/c it bleaches everything, but it looks like I may have to after using this product."
1,item discontinued in 2005,"This item was discontinued by Loreal in 2005. While it was a great product, any product still out there is expired. Per Loreal, if unopened, the shelf life was 3 years, which means that any product still in distribution was expired in 2008. At the least, it will not be effective, and at the worst, can be harmful. Do not purchase this product from any vendor."
5,Amazing!,"I too can say that I've used all sorts of products on my stubborn acne ridden skin with frustration. After 10+ years of struggling I started using this product every other day to get the most amazing results I've ever seen. I wouldn't go as far to say it's a miracle cure, but used in conjunction with several other products (including those with benzoyl peroxide) along with a motorized scrub brush I swear I've never been more impressed. I think it's the combination of it's ingredients: glycolic and salicylic acids. One controls oil, the other rejuvinates skin. I wish someone had told me a long time ago that the key to succesfully fighting acne is to use a combination of chemicals. This product was the missing link!I also don't find it to be nearly as harsh as it warns it can be and it's really nice to be able to use it so often without ending up with overly dry skin. That is a rarity among acne products.Highly recommended!"
3,good I guess,well I bought this product about 6 weeks ago and untill using it last night realized I was using it wrong. The directions say do not leave on for more than 5 minutes which I assumed meant wash it off. Not untill I looked on the back of the bottle did I see it said DO NOT RINSE OFF!! just apply the neutrilizer after 5 minutes. So I will update my prgress after 6 weeks of doing it the RIGHT WAY!!
1,Do not send the right product,"I purchased this product and have sent me another with the excuse, telling me the same. So my question is to put this on sale, but they do."
2,Broke me out! :(,"I was so excited to try this out to help get rid of my acne scars on my cheeks I've had for years and treat existing acne. While it did leave my skin feeling soft after, I woke up with small white heads the next morning in places where I've never had pimples! I gave it another shot and it again did the same thing. This product caused me to break out which lead to a lot of freaking out! >_< I'm sticking with dr. Woods black soap."
2,It's dead already... less than 30 days...,"Going to check into returning/exchanging it. Of course, I don't have the box either <sigh>... Worked fine - when it worked. Now, no lights, no nothing. Something in power supply died."
2,Waste of having Colin Firth in a movie!,"I had this movie on my wish list, but then saw it over the weekend and didn't like it. Any movie where Colin Firth is just a supporting role, and misused at that, is a waste of time in my opinion. Uma Thurman is beautiful beyond belief, but the ""lead"" actor (not Firth) is not interesting. Nor is it believable that she'd pick him instead. Not well scripted, either...big disappointment."
1,Really awful,"Hated this film. I'm not a huge fan of rom-coms, but every now and then I go in search of a good one. This is definitely not it.Couldn't stand the main character -- prissy, pretentious, self-righteous, controlling... Can't imagine any man worthy of the name would spend an entire evening with her, let alone fall madly in love. I wanted both of them to come to their senses and ditch the shrew.Also can't get into characters who do so many ethically questionable things. Seriously? You activate the sprinklers -- drenching people, destroying property, and deploying emergency personnel -- all because you're too chicken to own up to your decision? Pathetic.Not one funny or touching scene in the entire hour-and-a-half. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Is this love story for REAL?,"Uma Therman's character, a talk radio shrink, develops a theory about relationships called REAL love, in which she advises against romantic flings. Predictably, she ends up disavowing it by the end. That's the problem with The Accidental Husband: it's an utterly predictable romantic comedy. With such good actors, I kept waiting - hoping - for some spark. It has some moments - particularly the Indian party - and it is better than other recent films in this genre (particularly The Ugly Truth). However, at the end of the day, The Accidental Husband really is a case of seen one, seen em all."
1,horrible romantic comedy,"This review is the first I've ever written for Amazon.com. I don't usually write them but feel compelled as this movie was one of the worst romantic comedies I've ever seen. Truth be told, my husband and I only watched one third of it and then turned it off as it was that bad. I am a woman in my early 40s and typically love romantic comedies, even ones that only get three stars. I can't believe this movie currently has three stars! Uma Thurman is terrible in this role. She is completely miscast and ruins what might have been a decent movie. My husband and I could not get past her horrible performance. Do not rent this movie!"
3,fluffy chick flick,"I needed something non-challenging to watch last night so I rented this DVD. It's fairly formulaic and, unless you're in the mood for this type of film, could be boring, but I enjoyed it. I love Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and he's charming in this film. He plays the part perfectly, with a roguish glint in his eye. Colin Firth is good as the boring and predictable fiance and Uma Thurman handles her first romanti comedy role deftly. The writing is so-so, but the cinematography is gorgeous. I won't summarize the plot; other reviewers have already done that. This isn't the best romantic comedy out there, but it's more than adequate as a fun film. JDM has the potential to be a major romantic comedy star."
2,I'd rather watch a test pattern.,"At least, with an television broadcast test pattern you get a sound that's in tune. The soundtrack to this movie turned an otherwise mediocre dull, girl-falls-for-the-other-guy-for-no-good-reason ""love story"" into a ""Where did I put the earplugs; I can't find the MUTE button fast enough"" monotone singing, American-Idol rejects eppisode. William Hung has a better voice than whomever sang that hiddeous tune played throught, and after this movie. If the music was better I'd give it ONE more star. But it lost a star because I can't get the pain of that noise out of my head now! Save yourself the time and watch the brittish classic ""I'm alright Jack"". At least you can get an education from that movie, where you can't from this one."
2,Not a good rom com. Look elsewhere.,I love rom coms. This is not one to spend time on unless you've watched most of the rest. One cool thing is it feels like a rom com from the 90s.
5,"Love, Love, Love this movie!","Uma Thurman. Colin Firth. OMG Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The movie is sweet and funny and romantic and has a (very) happy ending. As a matter of fact, the ending keeps playing again and again in my head. SO great! Did I mention Jeffrey Dean Morgan? Good thing he plays a fireman. He melted my socks off."
2,simple and bad,This movie was not worth the time it took to watch it. It was a simple and poorly made film.
2,Delightful Example Of The Form,"I gave it two stars because, as I wrote my review, I realized that I wouldn't buy it. For me, three stars is a film I'd buy, whether I actually buy it or not. Four stars is a film I bought and watch regularly. I don't see myself watching this film again, any time soon, but I did like it.It is, as mentioned, a delightful example of the form: Romantic Comedy. I'm not a big Uma Thurman fan and that's probably why it didn't make bigger points. Colin Firth plays his all too common role of the nice guy, put aside, but he can't make up for what Uma doesn't bring to the film. I liked her as Venus, in ""The Adventures of Baron Von Munchausen"".Still, it's quite entertaining. The pieces more or less add up (not a big concern for romantic comedies, anyway) and they do manage to build (and hold) the suspense.I would enthusiastically recommend this as an afternoon break, a late night distraction, a rainy day popcorn moment. I'd rent it, but I wouldn't buy it."
5,accidential husband,"If you like a romatic comedy, you like to laugh, this is for you! It was a funny, fun loving, and entertaining. I have watched it a few times, and it was Great every time! You will Love it! Plus Jeffrey Dean Morgan is just handsome and great to look at!!!!!"
2,Accidental Husband,"First and foremost, I purchased this movie strictly because I am a fan of Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Truthfully, this was not a great movie. I understand why it didn't make the theaters (and if it did it wasn't long enough for me to hear about it). It is good to rent and see once. You have to be a fan of one of the actors in order to be able to watch multiple times. Glad I bought a ""used"" version."
4,Sweet and easy,"This is pure entertainment - and that was what I was looking for when I chose this film. Good actors and smooth going story, perfect for enjoyment and relaxation."
3,Is this love story for REAL?,"Uma Therman's character, a talk radio shrink, develops a theory about relationships called REAL love, in which she advises against romantic flings. Predictably, she ends up disavowing it by the end. That's the problem withThe Accidental Husband: it's an utterly predictable romantic comedy. With such good actors, I kept waiting - hoping - for some spark. It has some moments - particularly the Indian party - and it is better than other recent films in this genre (particularlyThe Ugly Truth). However, at the end of the day,The Accidental Husbandreally is a case of seen one, seen em all."
1,Kill me now.,"I don't write reviews, however, after wasting an hour and thirty one minutes of my life I figured a few more wouldn't hurt. Please watch something else tonight."
5,Funniest show ever!,"Bought the complete set about 5 years ago. I can watch them over and over and still get hysterical laughing!! Out of all the funny shows, this has got to be the best. The whole crew works so smoothly together, and it is nonstop laughter. I lost one tape and just now ordered this one. Cannot be without it!! A must see if you need to laugh!!"
2,Almost usless,"Unless you have 9-10 foot ceilings to hang this from don't waste your money, you can't do half the exercises without the ability to hang the system high."
3,Need idea but there is room for improvement,This product is similar to the TRX suspension system in that you can perform the same exercises. I do not like the bulkiness of the pulley although Ilove how it locks and unlocks. I do not like the bulkiness of the handles although I like how they can be removed. I personally use different handles. I do think it is a great product for the price!
3,Good points and bad points,I have used a few different suspension devices over the years and this one comes in the middle of the pack. I really like the handles but the metal piece is large and very uncomfortable to throw in a back pack and take on a jog. It sets up easily on a bar but I have not tried the door mount as of yet. I'm curious because I weigh about 215 pounds and that is a lot of force. When I used it on a Squat Rack that was unsecured I added a few 45 pound plates to the base of the rack to keep it from tipping. I f you use this at home great if you plan on traveling or doing some strength training after a run I would look elsewhere.
5,Great!,"I've used TRX at the gym and couldn't bring myself to spend $200 for some nylon straps. After research and comparison, I decided to get the rip:60 instead. Similar if not better construction, the rip:60 also comes with a great selection of high quality DVD's. Though the construction of the handles is a bit different, they work better in some situations. Others, I'd vote for the TRX. But for the difference in $, the choice was a no-brainer."
1,"dont waste you money, buy something else","i purchased this item because it had covers over the adaptors. well the inside of the adapters are so smooth that when i plug something into them, along with the movement of the car, the plug backs out of the adapter so much so that the device plugged into it stops working. i have purchased other items like this over the years and have never experienced this type of issue. dont waste your money, buy something elese"
1,Dual Socket Adaptor,"I purchased (2) of these based on other good reviews. After receiving them, I am returning them both.The single male end stays solidly in both my vehicles' cigarette lighter socket. It is one of the better male ends I've seen on various 12 volt products. The female ends however are not well designed. The inside walls of the female ends are smooth, with no notches, groves, or recessed embosses to hold any of my 12v accessory's male plugs securely. And, the sockets seem as if they could be slightly smaller in diameter. All of my accessory's' plugs just push themselves backwards in the adapter's sockets enough to break contact at the tips, and stop working with normal driving vibrations. As soon as you pick up or move something plugged into the adapter, instantly it unplugs. The plastic caps also fall off when you tip them down just from gravity. Caps I can live without, but not loose adapter sockets."
1,Worst experience ever,"Rockport shoes are great. I've owned different styles and they arecompetitively priced (just look at Ecco). However be wary of customerservice from Amazon if you buy products from a different website. Itried to exchange these shoes (.5 size bigger), but was given a refund($50). Amazon refuses to do anything about it. Instead they tell me Ican repurchase on Amazon at the higher price ($100). The item has nevergone out of stock. This is the kind of customer experience that willpush me to try other websites."
4,A decent primer,"The book is good until the chapter on inheritance.After that it unfortunately contains many confusing typos, and you have to already understand the topic to read thru those typos. Also the chapter on input/output is too quick, itshould have more examples. I still remained uncon-vinced about templates after reading the chapter on them. Overall, the book teaches basic factorswell, and motivates you to write code and do real stuff."
5,Clear and Concise,"The New Believer's Bible NLT is a wonderful guide for those who are new to Christ and have limited experience with the Bible. The language is plain everyaday English, and written in a way that makes comprehension easy. The topical articles are helpful and give strength to the new believer's walk, while encouraging and stimulating growth."
5,Great Book!!!!,Ordered this for my brother overseas. He received it fast and loves it! Great book that answers a lot of questions for New and Old Christians alike.
5,Great Print-Thin Size!,"This Bible, aside from being in The New Living Translation, which is very readable, also comes in a thin edition but with easily readable print. Many Bibles boast of their ""easy to read"" large print but this one really delivers! For people needing a Bible, not requiring a lengthy Concordance or footnotes this Edition is the answer!"
4,New Christian new Bible,For someone who just started a walk with Christ I found this bible to be very helpful.The notes that follow along with the text helped me to grasp a lot more of what a particular verse or key phrase was about.
3,Font too Small,"This is a very nice Bible, but for a large print, the font is too small. I bought 2, one for my mother & one for myself. There is no way my mother could read this font. It is the same size font as the study Bible I already own, but being 50+ myself, I have a hard time with it after just a few minutes"
5,Lanny Breuer Steps Down from Department of Justice!,Due to this great FRONTLINE report Lanny Breuer steps down from the United States Department of Justice! Hopefully we will see criminal charges of executives from the Big Banks.
1,Definitely too many words,"The customer who didn't like this book also disliked the Da Vinci Code. Books who only prove how clever the author's are. History is interesting by itself, it doesn't need all kind of clever theories."
4,Gangster of Cool,"If Johnny Guitar Watson, whose influence on Jimmie's playing is more than obvious, has been called the Gangster of Love then Jimmie could be the Gangster of Cool. ""Do you get the blues"" fits neatly Jimmie's formulaic approach to record making in that it has deep rhythmic pockets formed by experienced musicians who understand time and taste. Vaughan, unlike so many of his contemporaries, has an immediately recognizable sound characterized by phrasing that is better than the listener realizes. Jimmie's acoustic slide work on ""Off the Deep End"" is a perfect example of his unique ability to create sonic tension with minimum effort. A modern master of American music, Jimmie Vaughan continues show us the way."
4,DO YOU GET THE BLUES? --JIMMIE VAUGHAN,ONLY HEARD SAMPLES BUT GUARANTEED TO BE THE POWER OF UNDERSTATEMENT--ONE OF THE COOLEST F-----S TO EVER PLAY THE BLUES!---SAW THE THUNDERBIRDS IN A BAR AFTER THEY OPENED FOR CLAPTON IN THE SAME CITY (ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO)--JIMMIE STILL RULES!
5,My new Favorite!,The best of Jimmie Vaughn. I really like Let me in and in the middle of the night. Not a bad song on the cd!
5,LUCKY ME,"I'm the luckiest man alive! The first time I listened to this album, it was live in Austin, TX with Lou Ann Barton on hand and even ZZ Top guitarist jumping in on some incredible blues jams at Antone's (growing up ground for Stevie and Jimmie)! I hadn't even listened to the recorded album before I left there with my own personalized autographed copy of this album!! All I can say is that if you had the chance to stand three feet away from Jimmie Vaughan while he blistered out the guitar licks and blues you'd be sold also! Since that's not generally possible, buy this disc- you couldn't possibly regret it!"
4,"Well, this was interesting","Pretty girls for sure, interesting having the cop go undercover as a student and I just love how we are seeing more female stars in movies as appose o all male stars always being in the spotlight. I enjoyed this film but my only critique is not enough ""Fight Club"" We see only two fights lasting about 5 minutes total and we don't know what happened to the other girls. A cop shows up and we never see them again. What happened to the drunk girl who was left at the party? What happened to brittany? Well, there seems to be a part 2 coming out and I really hope the original cast return, because there are so many unanswered questions involving them that it needs to be answered in the second film. Good film though."
3,Waste of potential,The movie started off great. In the opening scene a cheerleader gets hit in the face with a shovel. But the next time you see another cheerleader get hit in the face with a shovel is like an hour later. This movie was all acting and no action.
3,Poor packaging,Items arrived on time but two of the bottles were broken. It created a huge mess. I had to spend 15 minutes cleaning it
3,Good but not Great -,"I thought I really got a great deal on these preserves until a week ago when my local Chicago area Italian Cheese store and Green Grocer ran a special on all flavors for $2.00 each. Caputo's, my local store, doesn't usually carry this brand and must have gotten an advantageous buy because $2.00 is an exceptional price.The strawberry is good, spreads easily but is a little runny. A good strawberry taste but my favorite is the raspberry. The labels are easy to remove and then the jars are great to reuse to store leftovers in the fridge.As with most imported jams, jellies and preserves Bonne Maman uses sugar and not high Fructose corn syrup. The label lists sugar and cane sugar so we don't know the specifics."
3,The perfect quick reference.,"""STAR WARS Episode I Who's Who"" is perfect as a quick guide to the characters in ""The Phantom Menace"" but doesn't give a lot of in-depth information on most the Key characters like, Qui-Gon Jinn or Queen Amidala. The book mostly repeats what we already can figure out by watching the movie. At least it has good clear pictures of the characters we hardly get to see like, Yaddle (the same species as Yoda)."
1,Don't Waste Ya Money,Read the Official Star Wars site instead of buying the small book. It contains small photos and extremely average descriptions.
1,A little confusing,This book is nice for knowing what will be on the placement test. I need to brush up on my math and this did nothing but confuse me. I have other books that are more useful than this one. I've been out of high school for years and I could comprehend math problems when I need to. This book did not satisfy me at all. I will continue to keep practicing with other books before I take the test. If you're in a crunch like me and you just want to know what could be on the test get this book. If you really need to score high to get into nursing I wouldn't recommend this book unless you have the time to through lessons and lessons before you get to the answer key.
2,Disappointed,I was supposed to receive this book about 4 days ago and still haven't received it yet. I'm hoping I get it before tomorrow so I can study for the test I signed up for this next week. Usually When I've ordered books they ship and deliver as they claim on time. This has been my first disappointment.
2,You get what you pay for...,"This rug is very thin, it slides all over so it needs a rug mat, it shows every little speck of lint etc. and still hasn't flattened out after 4 days on the floor. I do like the pattern, and the price was right, but even $25 is no bargain for such an inferior quality item."
2,rug,the rug is very big but its not very thick its very thin so it does not stay on the floor very well it slides every were
2,A questionable choice,This rug has been sitting on my floor for over 4 months and still shows no sign of straightening up. It is twisted in a very weird angle as if the two long sides of the rug do not have the same length.What a waste.
4,great little vacuum,"This vacuum is a god send for a small apartment with little room for a big, bulky vacuum to move around! I highly recommend! Would have given it 5 stars if you didn't have to empty the canister so often but with a small apartment, your usually only just a room or two away from the garbage!!! Picks up dog hair like a champ!"
1,this vacuum DOESNT suck,"This is the WORST piece of junk I have ever bought! It does absolutely nothing! Dont waste your money on this thing. In fact what ever small particles it picks up, it will later spit back out making a bigger mess."
2,Good at First...Like Everything...,"Okay...I got this on sale (thankfully) and was happy for the first few times I used it. Then, the dust container became so caked with stuff you could barely see through it. Also, the filter you take out will blow dust everywhere unless you can remove the filter without toching it...like the old game ""Operation"". Since it is impossible to remove something without touching it, it looks like you should be ready to get a good breath of dust while removing it. The other bad thing...and probably the worst thing is the dust that gets shot out the sides of this vacuum. I could feel the painful shots of bits of cat litter shooting out of the sides at my legs and the walls. This vacuum is crap. If you have no money, spend about ten or twenty dollars more and get about a hundred dollar difference...you will not be disappointed."
1,Spend A Little More And Get Something That Works Well More Than Two Times,"Do not, as I was, be fooled by the Eureka brand name, and believe that this will be a good product, even at such a low price. This is little more than a ""quick pick up hand-held"" with a stick handle. If you have carpets and pets, do not waste your time and money. Two decent carpet cleanings, and the product started to go down hill. The next 3-4 times, I had to go over every section at least five times, just to get a half decent job done. Now, after six uses, I need a new vacuum."
2,good for dust and pet hair....thats about it.,"I live in a one bedroom condo and thought this would be a nice little vacuum...well, it works good picking up stuff you could barely see, like light dirt and pet hair. But, try vacuuming something like a small piece of dry catfood and it wont get picked up. It will just roll around the brush at the bottom of the vacuum and once you turn it off it will all fall back out. If all you need is to vacuum dust and very light dirt, then this vacuum would be good. If you need to vacuum other stuff, go for a regular vacuum. However, this vacuum is also good for stairs."
5,The Greatest little vacuum,"This is the perfect vacuum for anyone living in a condo. Unlike the others writing reviews, I have been using mine for about 4 years now and I could not be more satisfied. It stores really easy. Yes it is a bit on the noisy side. I wash the filter once a month, and clean out the dirt (mostly hairs) that get stuck in the brush underneath. If you maintain your vacuum, it can last you forever. Adn I only paid 40$ for it.I'm now looking for a new filter since I wore the other one out washing."
4,Works just fine: low on price-high on performance,"This is my first bagless vacuum cleaner. For the price i paid, this vacuum cleaner works without any troubles. It cleans carpets and floors equally well. The only disadvantage is that it does not have an extension tube to reach inside futons and corners. For general floor cleaning, this vacuum is a very good choice in both price and performance."
5,Pet Hair Best Friend,"The Eureka 402A Mini Light Upright Vacuum is the best invention since the automobile. I have a house pet by the name of KABALI a long hair dog, he is cute as can be, but his hair sheds all over the place. My carpet was so hairy I had planned to have it removed. Then I discovered the 402A and I used it just to see if it would pick up anything. WOW! to my surprise the dog hair started disappearing right into the cup. I could not believe my eyes. I will and have told everyone I meet about this wonder Eureka vacuum 402A."
2,"good enough, happy to be moving on","my roomie just moved out and took his eureka 402a with him. good riddance. shopping for a new vacuum has made me realize how much i hated this one. sure, it was better than nothing, and better than sweeping the hardwood floors, but the static/ balloon idea is prolly stiff competition.i have short hair, my roomies have almost no hair, and yet i still had to cut the hair off the roller everytime i used this thing. not to mention the clog of dust rhinos that would cling to the brush unabashedly... 2 amps is not a lot of suck. it also stinks for getting into corners and small areas- no hose or attachments.it is light, and smallish- prolly ideal for an uncluttered dorm room.i'm excited to be moving on up to something with a little power, but still affordable: the Bissell 3910 ""Momentum"". i'll let you know how it goes..."
4,Great Little Vacuum,"I have had this vacuum for about 2 years now. I originally bought it because my apartment was tiny and only had 2 small carpets. It definitely does the job. Now that I am in a house, I use it just for my bedroom, and after 2 years it's still sucks up the dog hair better than our big vacuum. It's very lightweight (my 10 year old neice can pick it up with ease) and changing the canister is quite simple. I gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons. One is it would be great if it came with an additional filter and two, because even though it's small and fits in tight spaces, attachments would make it 5 star worthy. All in all, money well spent."
2,Not happy.,"I purchased the Eureka Boss Super Light for my apartment about a year ago. I was happy with the price, and the super light weight of the vaccuum, and thought it would work well in my small apartment. WRONG. I suppose you get what you pay for. First off, it's loud...very loud for such a small vaccum. Second off, it's light, sure, but sometimes it's just impossble to push on the carpet! For some reason it feels like it'll get stuck and I have to give it a huge shove to keep moving along. Third, and most importantly...it's WEAK. I've got a normal old carpet, nothing special or plush...and it does a half-you know what-job. It's very selective as to what it'll suck up (and believe me, I clean the filter and canister after ever vacuuming I do.) Frustrating.Final words-pay the extra $ and get a better vaccum."
4,A pretty good vacuum for the price,"I brought this vacuum about six months ago. I like it because it doesn't require batteries or bags and it picks up almost everything. It is also light and easy to use.However, this vacuum is not great for picking up hair. I have long hair and all of it gets caught in the brush roll. Everytime after I vacuum I have to pull the hair out of there. Maybe it would work differently with short hair.I noticed some people complained about the noise. Honestly, I don't really notice or care...but I guess it is kinda loud.Overall, I would buy the vacuum again."
2,Can it make any more noise?,"First off, I paid $25.00 for this at Walmart, so I would suggest going there first if you decide you want this light weight vacuum. At the time of this writing Amazon is selling it for $54.00. Secondly, it works fine for the amt of money I spent. Thirdly, my biggest problem is the thing is so LOUD that in order to use it, I will have to put ear plugs in. Seriously,this product makes about as much noise as a fire alarm!! I have an email in to Eureka.com because their 800 number did not have this vacuum as an option on their automated voice mail and I was disconnected for trying to reach a human being to speak to!"
4,Great little vacuum,"I don't know what the other people here are doing with their 402A models. But I have been using this little vacuum for almost a couple of years now. The only thing I needed to replace was the dust cup filter (it's less than three dollars). One reviewer noted some small particle dust coming out of the blower - this is probably true since I noticed it at one instance when vacuuming some some fine grain dirt. However, the dust cup filter at the time did need replacing."
2,Waste of money,I bought mine from Costco 6 months ago and the motor just died on me. I say spend a little more and get something that lasts a few years.
2,Not worth it...,"I bought this vacuum as a holdover when we moved before getting a real vacuum. I wish I had spent ten more dollars and gotten something else. My home is full of high pile carpet. This vac has only two settings-- ""carpets"" and ""floors"". ""Carpets"" ripped out so much fiber from my carpets that the entire chamber was FILLED with it within five minutes and it could no longer pick up ANYTHING. ""Floors"" wouldn't pick up lint from my carpet. It worked fine on my kitchen tile, but, so what, so does my broom. In short, if you have high pile carpet, this thing is about as useful as a broom."
5,Excellent for small spaces,"Does great on my tiny condo...fabulous for tiles, marble and carpet. I highly recommend this tool as part of your cleaning gadgets if you live in a small space. This vacuum is both light and strong, I use it all over my house."
2,CRAP!!!!!!!!!!! doesnt do the job,I would never recommend this vacuum to anyone. My sister and I purchased separate but exact vacuums and they honestly are not worth the plastic they are made of. Work the very first time you use them then they stop. I am very displeased with its performance. I purchased mine through a local retailer and they refused to make good on the warranty - now Im stuck with this piece of junk. Filter plugs up almost immediately with virtually no way to replace it oreven instructions on how to clean it.
3,Good Vacuum- With Some Modification,"I bought this vacuum last summer for my classroom. I tried it at home first and my wife hated it. She tried to clean the stairs and sand was blowing out of the exhaust, stinging her legs. When I took it to school, I noticed that some of the dust and dirt were blowing out. I tried to put some weather seal around the filter but that didn't work. Then I taped a piece of gauze over the intake above the dirt cup. That worked. There is a little clean-out on the bottom of the unit which needs to be cleaned quite often. All in all, it does the job with small bits of paper and dirt, but I have to pick up anything heavy like a pencil eraser or a pebble. I didn't pay much for this vacuum so I don't expect a lot of power."
4,Great little vacuum!,"This lightweight vacuum does a superb job of cleaning the area rug and hardwood floors in between regular heavy duty vacuuming. It's inexpensive and very light, and you can turn the roller brush on and off. I have two dogs and two birds, and between them they can make a room filthy in one day. All I have to do is use this vacuum and the room is clean in a jiffy! As others have mentioned, it is a little loud, the cord should be longer, and the filter could be easier to clean, but all in all it is a good little vacuum. And, if you clean the dust cup and remove the hair from the roller brush when you are done, it should continue to work well for you."
3,It's okay for the value.,"I do like the fact that this product is inexpensive. However, I guess you get what you pay for. You must charge in order to use it and the charge does not seem to last that long. Also, when I shave it does miss some hairs so I have to go back and charge it first. Then, I have to get the stray hairs. Also, recently, the blades broke two weeks ago so now I have to replace them."
5,A Jewel at Any Age,"The editorial review says this book is ideal for 80ish retirement home individuals. I completely agree, but also feel like it is idea for anyone still inhaling oxygen! The author is absolutely adorable and every time I don't think I'll be able to laugh any more, all I have to do is turn the page. Don't let anyone stick this book into a category based on age- it is a book about a lady who not only appreciates life, but can laugh at it, often in spite of herself."
1,Ugh,This game is bad. Bad bad bad. Let me start by saying that I love playing disc golf. Maybe that's why im so hard on this game but I dont know that John q public would feel any different.The disc golf side lacks any features and all you can do is play a front 9 back 9 or all 18. No computer opponent no low score leader board. You you pointlessly playing. it might just be my taste but I thought the game was a little too tough. There wasn't a leveling up system or anything like that to keep you playing. To throw you just flick in a straight line on the second screen. Obviously this lacks feedback so it's hard to get a feel for how far the disc is going to go. There is also no meter so you can't see afterward how well your shot went. Its worth pointing out that the graphics are sub par to boot.I didn't buy this name for the ultimate half of it but I tinkered with it for fun. I'm not familiar with the sport in real life and this did nothing to help that.Overall just avoid this game at all costs.
3,"For the winter months, it gets the job done!","This is just about the disc golf game.As a disc golf enthusiast I can't wait for this winter to end, playing out in the snow and cold is just brutal. I found this in the bargain bin and decided to give it a shot. I won't lie, this game could have been a lot better. The controls implemented with the DS are not the best, but they are on the right track as far as making good use of the touch pad for throwing and direction. The lack of licensed discs and only 18 holes is disappointing, and the graphics are not great, even for the DS, but behind it all, this stripped down disc golf game works if you really love the sport and might not have the ability to play at a given time. I imagine I will play this through a few times before spring comes again, put it down and pick it up again next winter, but for the bargain price, it was totally worth it."
2,Complicated,This is a complicated game on DS. I assumed I would like it as I like most golf games on other consoles. I dont think golf makes a good game on a hand held game system.
5,"An amazing vac, and cordless to boot!","I used to own a Eureka upright that was heavy, loud, and the cord was always in the wrong place no matter what. I live in a studio apartment but I thought I needed a ""big"" vac to keep the place clean. I read the other reviews and decided to buy the Cordless Boss, and I'm glad I did! I dumped my big/hot/loud vac, the Cordless Boss actually cleans BETTER than the huge monstrosity, AND being cordless and light I tend to spend more time cleaning instead of rushing through (which may account for the better cleaning). I keep tropical fish, and this (a) doesn't disturb the fish (b) cleans up spilled food no problem and (c) I don't have to search for an open plug. Oh, it cleans closer to the edge than the bigger vac did as well. Cleans easy, too, and no bags to run out of in the middle of a cleaning job. It's also easy to store, fits nicely in my microscopic closet. I wish I could find something bad to say, but I can't.."
2,DISPOSABLE VACUUM,"The vacuum is a little cumbersome for something small. It does vacuum fairly well, but as stated not meant for a main vac. I purchased one for a summer home and used it very little. A maximum of half a dozen times. Battery did not last. Cost more for a battery and the vacuum. Might as well dispose of it when battery dead than just buy a new battery!"
2,Cordless but not very effective,"We didn't have much success with this. It doesn't pick up from the floor or carpet anywhere near as well as our corded vacumn. We found it frequently took mutiple passes to pick up objects like, hair, dried macaroni and bits of paper. On the carpet, even after multiple passes we still had to use our corded vacumn. When you turn the vacumn off, it leaves a small pile of dirt. This is a nice idea, but I would pass on this item. We ended up discarding ours, since it didn't have any value to us, and doesn't even make a nice plantar. We decided to just stick with our corded vac and a broom for the floors."
1,"Per company, not supposed to be your main vaccuum","Vaccuum runs for only 20 minutes maximum. Have no rugs, only tile. Called Eureka and the customer rep. said it was never intended to be a main vaccuum, that lightweight in the ads mean not a heavy duty vac - and that I can get a spare battery for $47.00. Told her I had paid that for the vac on Amazon.com - she said it was unfortunate that it doesn't say so in their ads."
5,Great product - can't wear it out!,"With a golden retriever, between shedding hair and dirt, dust and leaves she brings in from outside, I needed a quick, cordless vac and this one takes the cake. To maximize battery life, I like to run the battery all the way down after every few uses. After vacuuming all of my hard surfaces (about 1,000 square feet) without the brush running, then the carpeted surfaces with it running (about 900 square feet), I still have to sit the vacuum in the corner for about 15 minutes with the brush running to run the power out.The vacuum so easily gets under beds and other furniture that I've filled the dust container with dog hair more than once.This was well worth the money."
3,Good for the price,"I purchased this just for use in my tiled kitchen since I have wall-to-wall carpeting in the rest of my apt. I liked that it was lightweight and rechargable. I keep it plugged in all the time and just unplug it and use and then replug in again. It isn't high powered but it was fine for the kitchen to pick up crumbs, etc. I also used in on my carpet for light cleaning, and it did a nice job. However, after two years, seems all the power is gone or barely gone and I almost never use it anymore. Wish it could have lasted longer since it was convenient."
3,Warranty does not cover charger or anything else,"After four months use at our weekend house the charger on our 570b failed. I have just come from Buckhead-Midtown Vacuum, the closest authorized Eureka Service Center. They informed me that warranty repair is at Eureka's discretion and that purchasers are basically on their own for repairs. I paid the $10.50 for the part but now know the unit is disposable if anything serious happens."
1,Bad brush system,The brush system just isn't long enough to really pick up what it should. When I saw the unit I thought it would do a great job but it doesn't. I was extremely disappointed in the performance. Its all looks and truly little action. I could never recommend this item.
2,almost one star,I bought this vacuum based on the reviews and I'm very disappointed. I just received it yesterday and I already know it wasn't worth my time or money. The battery takes like 16 hours to charge but it won't last close to 16 hours. Any human hair gets wrapped around the belt and any rug debris got clogged immediately. Stop looking at these reviews now and search for a vacuum that's worth your investment. I didn't rate it one star because it's so light weight I am considering giving it to a child to play with since that's all it is is a toy.
4,A Man's best friend,"I had to come back to this site just to say that this is the perfect vacuum for our home with wood floors, kids, dogs, and all the things that come with them. I love to quickly pull out this little guy without all the power cord hassles. It works great on our stairs too. Some days our home looks like it's just the 2 of us again. Good power and durability for the price."
5,Great little Vac!,"I have to admit that I was skeptical at first, but this little vac packs a pretty good punch! It serves as a great 2nd vac in our home. We have a central vac system, but sometimes it's too much trouble to deal with when you only need to clean a small area. (Like under a high chair!)We will be moving soon, and I plan to buy a 2nd one for the upstairs rooms. I was amazed at how much something so small could pick up. I would reccomend to everyone!"
5,Excellent even for tall people,"I was a bit concerned about the height of the handle after careful research on this vacuum. Everything else looked great in the reviews but since I am 6'4"" I was concerned that it would be way too short except for stairs. I was relieved to find that it is fine for someone even my height. It works great and is just the thing for my bare floor kitchen and hall and ideal for the scatter rugs there. My main vacuum (Panasonic) was useless on the bare floor and for the scatter rugs. And even though I do not like bagless vacuums since they are so messy to deal with, I highly recommend this vacuum."
3,O.k for very lite duty...,"I bought this vacuum looking for something to do a quick,easy pick up between vacuums.I have both hard wood floors and braided rugs.Considering this vacuum is light and cordless,it would be great for the kids to help out with.This vacuum is o.k for very quick,light pick ups.Anything more,say,cheerios on the floor and it won't pick up.Picks up hair just fine.The battery holds a charge for about 10 minutes .Not enough for more than two rooms before it slows down and has no suction.Overall not worth the price.I have used stick vacuums with better suction."
2,Clogs all the Time,"I was very excited to get this vacuum since I would be using to clean a large room with wood floors and a couple of area rugs. It did great on the area rugs, but on wood floors it just blew around the dust. Then after a few months, it kept getting clogged and leaving dust balls all over the floor. It also lost its charge faster."
2,Battery is useless,"It's okay with dog hair, but I found only the ""carpet"" setting works (even on tile floors). The ""floor"" setting merely pushes and blows the dirt, dust and fur around. The bad news is that it starts to poop out after about two rooms. The battery is awful! I would not recommend it unless you live in a one-bedroom apartment and can vacuum every day."
5,I Absolutely Love It!,"I'm so happy I purchased this vacuum! Talk about handy! I used to have to drag out my heavy Kirby, plug it in, etc., but now I just quickly unplug my new Eureka cordless, turn it on and start cleaning! It really sucks! In a good way! I love the fact that there is no bag. It's very easy to empty and I am always amazed at how much stuff it picks up. I highly recommend this product!"
3,Great Except for Battery,"Worked great about 4 times - then it just stopped. Battery seems to have died (no charge on volt meter). Too bad they use a NiCad battery instead of a better, longer lasting, NiMH like in the Roomba. Otherwise nice when it works."
5,better than expected,"we have the shark ultra light sweeper advertised on t.v.its fine for a quick pick up but if you really want a vacuumn with the power of a full size vacuumn and don't want to struggle with cords and changing bags grab, the eureka 570 B can't say enough good things about it=its a winner!!"
1,Not a Value Purchase,"For the last five years, I have relied upon the customer review at amazon.com to choose a product and had been very happy with the outcome until this one. I purchased it last October, and the problems I have encountered are:1. Most of the hair gets entangled in the brush rather than getting sucked into the dust collector. What happens as a result is that quite a few strands of hair lie around where you leave it standing.2. The pipe through which dust travels before ending up in the dust collector often gets clogged, and so does the small space in the back of the vacuum head, and it is not easy to notice it until you realize it is not picking things up quite as well.3. There is a small flap that blocks the pipe when the vacuum is off. It just came off after 10 months in commission.I liked the fact that it is cordless, but that is not enough to justify the cost and the problems."
5,Quick Shipping - Good Product,Exactly what I expected when arrived - shipping time was great. I was worried it was going to be very heavy after reading one review - but was much lighter then expected. Good product for the money!
4,competant gentle slicing,"Good quality, easy to use. Get what you pay for. The #11910 slicer is not adjustable. Works well on Wisconsin/Tillamook types of cheddar as well as softer ""Kraft"" types. Will bring and leave at wine tasteings. Purchased locally for < $4.Used successfully > 100 X's."
3,Bg & sturdy but heavier than it needs to be.,When I first picked this up I was kind of put off becauseit's s much heavier than another I've used for years butthen I realized that this one is adjustable as to thicknessof slice. I gave it as a gift but am not proud that I've givena really cool item - despite the fact it's hard to fault it.
3,SMALL,"So I purchased this item as a cute gift for my boyfriend because we eat tons or rice and asian foods and he loves monkeys! It says that it's for children, but I assumed it would just be a tad bit small. It's actually VERY small! Make sure you pay attention to the sizing they give because it's far too small for an adult... not even passable.At the very least it's cute and would make a great single serving of rice. The spoon is too small for an adult to use, though."
3,Good but Dated,"This is a good book but it is dated. I also purchased ""Wine for Dummies"" (WfD) by the same authors. I recommend that, instead (not necessary to get both, at least at first). The WfD book has excellent coverages of different countries and that information provides a great deal of groundwork. Only if you know all of that information cold, then consider this book.Much of the vintage information is dated. The authors mention in WfD that vintage is much less important, yet they refer to it often, as in this book. This is to be expected, but not quite consistent with their theories. That being said, much of the date related information is old -- 5 years is past prime for many wines that we buy for drinking with our dinners. Hence, I think it is dated and it is much better just to refer to WfD."
2,"not good, but not too bad either","If I'd had a chance to rent this DVD first, I definately wouldn't have bought it. It's a trashy story (part 1+2), the acting is very bad, but there are some parts that are worth watching. If you are into independent movies, this movie could be some fun , but try to rent it, do not buy it. It's a waste of money."
3,Kind of Slow,"I remember reading ""Ashes to Ashes,"" ""Dust to Dust,"" and ""Garden of Thorns"" when they first came out, and enjoying them very much. I haven't seen anything from Carl in quite some time, and actually did not know she was still writing. It was a pleasant surprise to see more books offered for such reasonable prices on the Kindle, but I was disappointed in ""Shadows in Scarlet."" It is in a somewhat dated modern gothic style, which I still enjoy, but the first half seemed to drag on and on without really going anywhere. There was a lot of exposition, and establishment of characters. The story picked up about midway when the location changed to Scotland, and it became a much better book. The writing style is similar to modern gothics by Elizabeth Peters/Barbara Michaels, but the pacing is slower and the characters are less engaging. It was ultimately worth the discounted Kindle price, but it was generally disappointing."
4,For baking only!,"This malted barley flour seems to be only partially fermented, so it is less sweet than others available here. If you try to use it in a chocolate malted drink, you will get a lot of raw flour taste along with its modest sweetness. It is really good, however, for putting in cakes and bread, adding a nice touch of sweetness and it really kickes the yeast into gear for light baked goods. The milling and packaging is of good quality with this product."
3,Two many,The malt is great but a package of 20 oz bags doesnt make sense and is a waste. You use the malt 1 teaspoon at a time so one 20 oz package is a lifetime supply.
5,Love this set!,"I purchased the 47-piece set[...]and I am very happy with it. [..]. With the free shipping selection and the special offered in Housewares [..]this set is a great deal!I really like the design and use of colors, and I also appreciate the attractive form of the pieces (creamer, sugar bowl, tea pot, plates, bowls, etc.). This year I am adding a gravy boat and the large serving platter to my collection.This set is perfect for any Autumn meal, not just Thanksgiving dinner (although that is why I originally bought it).I was so happy with it when I received it in Spring, I made a turkey dinner on Easter for family and friends to ""break it in."" Everyone commented on how pretty the table looked especially the dishes. And the best part the dishes clean up beautifully in the dishwasher."
5,Thanksgiving Dinner Plates,"I just ordered 16 of the Thanksgiving Dinner Plates to be used in a buffet style dinner. As family members lined up to pick up their plate they all had such complimentary comments about the plates. They said the colors in them were beautiful, the quality is superb and the turkey looks like an actual Thanksgiving turkey. What a nice touch to have these beautiful plates to eat on at Thanksgiving. I just love them and will be putting them out every year. My order arrived right on schedule too so that I could use them this year. Thank you so much."
3,BEST EVER!...,"I was at a friend's sleepover party and she rented the movie, Hardball. I loved it, mainly because of the songs!... They totally got me pumped and I just wanted to get up and dance!... How much better could it get!! Buy it, quick....!"
4,versatile receiver,"This handy, portable Delphi xm receiver works well, as long as the placement indoors allows the antenna to clearly face the south. Also the reception is more stable on the second floor. Once placement issues are worked out, the sound from this small box is very satisfying."
5,XM Boombox,I got this today and I am blown away... great sound and great reception... had an attena inside the box that can be extended to a window or outside... or just left inside the box. Just leaving it inside the unit worked great. It has super sound. I couldn't be more happy with this purchase. I use it with an INNO and the adapter sold separatly. The Bass is great... really fills my loft where I listen to it. Really makes my Inno a home unit as well as a portable. Now I don't need to go in the car to hear XM. Also the unit can be battery powered or plugged into the wall. It has a handle to take anywhere. Horay... this is a real winner. BTW he name on the box is Delphi Premium Sound System... I don't know what the diff is for the table model but this one is all I could want for a home system.
1,'spirit' literally means a ghost,"I think it's a con!! This is not at all helpful for any serious meditator or anyone who just wants to be relaxed, because in this tape there is some ghostlike sound effect totally masking the background of forestish environment. This is not only too noisy but it sounds too stupid and repetitive, just spoiling everything. You really cannot hear birds or stream. The producer must have thought that the listeners of this kind of environmenal tapes are very naive. I am not particularly fussy. I even tried listening to this tape while I was having a bath only to find that it irritates me a lot. Frankly, I would go for the 3rd movement of Bruckner's symphony 8th, if you like spiritual yet quite repetitive sound."
3,nice little washer,"this is a small and light weight washer,starts easy and works strong,only the hose is kind of short for going all around the car,the spray gun is not strong enough mine is broken in half in the middle ,inner pipe is broken in less than 2 mounths,an other issue is that you can not buy the parts and accessories from same people ,not a great inventory,any how i am looking around to find a right gun for my pressure washer.,"
1,Consistent Product Failure - Don't Buy,"I'll have to start by saying that if this product didn't start failing, this is an excellent mouse.I bought five of these from Amazon on December 12, 2008: two for my children, two for gifts, and one for myself. It is now February 10, 2009 - less than two months have elapsed since all five have been put into use. All five have started exhibiting signs of failure. All five will spuriously double-click when a single-click action is taken. Three of the five now need several single-click attempts before it recognizes a single-click has taken place (and of those, some of them become double-clicks).Unless this is a firmware issue that can be corrected by a firmware upgrade, I'd suggest you steer clear of this mouse."
2,looks fancy but not durable,"Recently the mice stop working. One click becomes double click, and I only use it for one year. It looks fancy but but honest does not feel very much in hand in the first place."
1,Not a fan,I purchased this mouse and used it for around a week and simply could not get used to it. I have large hands and could not find a comfortable position. The ring finger button was often pressed instead of the right click button and I found myself hitting the resolution button when using the scroll wheel during gaming. I ended up returing this mouse in favor of the Logitech MX Revolution. It is a much better fit for me.
1,do not buy,"had 1010 ok but left button started acting up called creative. said send it in but i had to pay shipping well they have the 2020 on there web for 21$ plus 9.95 shipping when i got it it wouldn,t work called them they said send it back they would send new one well i did they didn,t send me a new mouse and credited my charge 21$ no explanition and would not refund 9.95 shipping they say its there policy"
2,Another poor quality product with the Fatal1ty name on it...,"The cord is too short and the mouse is made of cheap quality plastic making the mouse have a non-solid feel in your hand. Basically the mouse is trying to mimic the old Logitech Wingman Gaming Mouse, but if you really enjoyed that mouse, go for Logitech's latest and greatest gaming mouse, the G5 Laser Gaming Mouse and you won't be disapointed, Best Buy has them for half off right now at their store and website, so I just picked one up."
1,"Pretty and sleek, but doesn't last long","I owned a Creative Fatal1ty 1010 for about six months and the left button stopped working (would not click anymore, unless it was in a good mood, which was rare).Creative sent me a supposedly brand-new Fatal1ty 2020 mouse, which I have had for around nine months, and now the left button has broken again, this time the opposite problem of holding down the ""click"" every time I click, meaning files I only wanted to select but not open are opened and whenever I close windows using the upper-right-hand corner ""X"" box, it closes all other windows behind it rapidly because the button is being held down (by the mouse).At this point, the warranty is up, and so is my patience. From the looks of it, others seem to have had similar problems. In case you're wondering, I use this mouse around one hour every day. Save your $30, it isn't worth $3."
1,"Great design, but poor construction!","I loved the small size since I like to grip with my fingers. This has all the buttons I need but the QUALITY simply sucks! The main buttons started going out and not responding due to poor design of mechanism inside the mouse!!! I tried super glue but that lasted a few days before it would not respond to clicks. I bought another thinking it was bad defect, but it happened again! So not buy this if you are an avid gamer! I was sad because this was my favorite mouse to use! However, it did suffer from bad tolerances and the weight rattles.I just bought a Sidewinder X8 and it sucks too due to it's huge size and the worst wheel ever designed! Anyway, stay away from these 2 mice!"
1,Clicking Inconsistencies,"First off, what I received is NOT a FATAL1TY 2020 mouse. Take a look at the paperwork that comes with it. Right, the red and black sheet. You've been shipped a FATAL1TY 1010 mouse instead.Secondly --and most importantly-- the left and right mouse buttons have started double-clicking, triple-clicking, or not-clicking when I'm just attempting a single-click. They also don't always recognize a double-click. I have two of these, and both started to fail after about three weeks of use individually.So far, the coolest thing about this mouse has been THE BOX it came in. I can't recommend this mouse to anyone."
5,No more pain!,"With my current job, I have to walk all day and sometimes all night long and leave me a badly painful, fatigue legs the next day. After I start using this wedge, I feel like I wake up with new fresh legs! It also help decreasing my varicose vein."
5,Good Movie,"I bought this movie for my wife for Christmas. She use to watch it with her mother, growing up. It was a good memory she had of her mom. I was well pleased with the price, and quick shipping. Thanks!"
2,A must see movie,I thought this movie was one of the best I've seen in a long time. It was well written and beautifully acted. Patricia Arquette is definitely the best female actress of the 90's. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see cinema at its' best.
3,The Beauty of Innocence,One could say this movie is about love but on a deeper level it is the love of innocence itself that is the entrapment of this beautiful story. Wildflower is a movie like no other. It captures the beauty of innocence through a young girl named Alice Guthrie who is locked in a shed. Alice has epilepsy and is almost deaf. Played by Patricia Arquette this is definitely her most beautiful role. Reese Witherspoon also stars and does an incredible job as the one who finds Alice and helps her. I give Wildflower three stars because three is a special number.
5,Spectacular movie,This has got to be the best movie I have ever seen. It brings out a mixture of emotions that I have never experienced in one movie. Patricia Arquette was fabulous!! This is definately a movie worth seeing and owning.
4,Jifymom,"Product was shipped in a very timely fashion. Story line was good and tied in with Paradise Island, but if you did not read paradise island you would still understand the story line. Would recommend this read to anyone, kept me guessing to the end."
2,stripped gears,"I bought this cordless drill two years ago in a kit that included a flashlight, two batteries and a case. It has all the features I need in a tool like this: quick stop, good torque, light weight, two speeds, quickly rechargeable batteries. However, today it shot craps during a routine driving of long wood screws. I'm sure from the symptoms that the gears are stripped in one spot. I use the makita frequently but only for home projects and woodworking, not as a professional. So it should last much longer than two years. I will atempt to buy a replacement gear assembly and put it back in service but I cannot recommend the tool based on this experience. I've noticed at least one other review citing the same failure mode so it must be a design deficiency."
2,Extremely Light Reading,"This book was creative, but often verged on dull. I'd recommend it if you feel like zoning out and reading something purely mindless, but not otherwise. Don't have high expectations for this one."
3,camera cable not the same,what was sent was to complicate to use when original cable is a direcet plug in.this unit required disassembling of the back
2,It won't play in my DVD player.,"It is made for a different region, and won't play on my DVD player. It arrived in a good amount of time, and was inexpensive. I really wish it was able to be used here."
3,classic 2nd gen punk band. excellent collection of BBC material,as 'professional' punks this band was very tight live- this cd plays on those strengths with tight live performances with plenty of chatter and into/ outro action.
3,Okay,"This is a book written in 1995 and yet there is a whole chapter on DOS and other outdated technology. No office still uses DOS! With the ever changing technology in today's world, the author would have been so much better off skipping that whole chapter. Letter formats and telephone etiquette will still apply ten years from now, but when talking of computers; today's newest is tomorrow's obsolete. So get this book for general office information but not to become computer savvy or to learn of the software businesses are now using."
4,Good resource,This book met my needs for updating my secretarial resources. I haven't done administrative support for about 10 years and this brought me up-to-date on a lot of the changes. A worthwile addition to your library resources.
2,Okay for businsess people,I looked it over and it does not apply to me or the type of work I seek as far as working from home.
1,Worst Math Textbook Ever,"I'm a mechanical engineering student at Purdue University, which means I don't have 12 hours/day to work on diffeq or linear algebra. Circuits and dynamics make sure of that. This book explains nothing to the reader. If you're thinking of skipping lecture to sleep a little longer, don't. There is absolutely no way you'll be able to learn how to do the problems using the text. At least the calculus book we used for 3 semesters was useful in teaching the material."
4,Good Intro Book,"Decent book, however definitions need to be improved. Contradicts himself in future chapters (i.e. his definition of a Matrix).Structure is good, although writing is not particularly engaging. Then again, what math text is engaging?Problems are challenging, but not overwhelmingly difficult. They are good practice for the subject matter.Sufficient for an introductory differential equations and linear algebra course. I've heard the publisher and writer are fixing the text's shortcomings.A great teacher can more than make up for these shortcomings."
1,Just avoid it.....,"It is hard to understand why my university is using this book, but it is, and going from Calculus I/II, taught through ""Calculus: Concepts and Contexts"" by Stewart (a GREAT book where examples are explained and *gasp* a solutions manual was available!!) to this stale-piece-of-bread of a book is ridiculous. Hopefully you will have a teacher that teaches better than this book reads, not to mention a math department that can just steer clear away from this ungodly book..Lack of color and reader-friendly design? Just the tip of the iceberg, seriously, unless you are just use to books written in math and not in english, you'll be fairly disapointed."
1,confusing book,"This book is hard to learn from. Being an engineering student, I consider myself a fairly well educated indivitual. In my course of studies this is by far the worse math book I have ever used. The author is confusing and uses poor examples."
2,Less than Satisfactory,"First, there are countless typos and errors, and no solutions manual. Even the answers to odd numbers in the back of the book are not well done. Some sections are very straightforward and are easy to follow step by step, while most sections leave me as mystified after the third reading as I was before I opened the book. It feels like it was written for mathematicians, by mathematicians - but that is not the average student. The people taking this class would love to know how in the world any of this applies to actual problems in engineering, physics, chemistry, etc. I would prefer a balance between the endless mindnumbing proofs, and more tangible application problems."
3,Proof it before you print it!,"I bought this book in hopes of pining down an actual time line of events between Rommel, and Patton.It started out OK, but between the poor grammer, spelling, typos, wrong dates of events, and the use of multiple paragraphs, when one sentence, or 2 at the most would have been perfect. I was greatly disapointed, and feel if you are truely looking for historical facts on Rommel, then one would do best with those who were the closest to him. Such as Manfred his Son, and of course Desmond Young who got the facts as they were still fresh and not so over the top at the time."
2,"Good subject, poorly executed","I finished this book today.No maps, no photos, only 2 footnotes that I noticed, no bibliography, and numerous typos and poorly written sentences.Will avoid this author and this publisher in the future."
3,"Pretty good book, but in serious need of copy editor","I started reading this book in a bookstore, and like another reviewer commented, couldn't stop. The book is fairly well-paced, does a good job of giving an overview of the development of Patton and Rommel, and gives you a sense of what made them tick. That said, the number of typographic and spelling errors in this book - around 100! - were extremely distracting. For a layman like me, some maps would also have been useful in the sections where the author gave very detailed presentation and analysis of key battles."
4,Greate Bok - Butt to manie typoes,"I am 300 pages into this book and find it very informative and entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about these 2 men.However, my dog could have done a better job with the spelling."
4,Very Good Book,"I read this book last night and I think that this is a well-researched book about two of the Second World War's famous commanders, George Patton and Erwin Rommel. I really like the fact that the book explores thier similarities and their diffrences in personality, command style, and circumstances in which they found themselves under.The one weakness that the book has is that I couldn't use the bibliography all that much in looking up instances and I found myself somewhat frustrated.Despite this flaw, I think that this is a very good book about Patton and Rommel which should be read."
4,A unique story of love and hope,"I bought this book at a library sale and by the time I finished it, I was hooked. Unfortunately it was written in 1995 and even though I knew their had to be a 2nd book, it took me a long time to find it. This is a book about a dragon named Gonard, a medtech, and a girl called Itsa. Their travels together as Gonard developes into a special being. Love, hate, betrayal and hope. You will visit wonderous cities with them and come to care about this very special dragon.."
5,Good Shoes,"They arrived a week before it said it would (:Well i loved them but wasnt able to keep them because they look like ""gangster"" shoes.LOL Even though i am gang relattedbut good shoes; good quality"
3,Good product,These are good around the yard work boots. Which is what they where bought for. I like the look and the thickness of the sole. They are comfortable to wear through out the day
5,Highly recommended,"This book belongs alongside DeLillo's WHITE NOISE and Cheever's BULLET PARK. It is an entertaining and incisive glimpse into the US at the beginning of the 21st century, with scathingly on-target observations of academia, addiction, love, children, divorce, liberalism, Thoreau, Macbeth, chat rooms, street crime, scholarly journals, English Composition, multinational corporations, and, of course, sleep. The prose is exquisite--modern without being obscure, witty without being pedantic, touching without being self-pitying. It's as if Philip Roth or Saul Bellow had dipped into David Foster Wallace's copy of the Physician's Desk Reference. Like the previous reviewer, I can't understand why I'm not seeing this book all over the place and yet, so far, apart from Amazon.com, I've seen it in only one bookstore."
2,too wordy and tangential,"as another reviewer stated, i too had to force myself to finish this book.( i read about a book a day.) i never was able to discern a plot, and i basically did not like the characters. her kids were obnoxious, she allowed them to be and did not seem to make them accountable for their behavior. i had a touph time ascertaining if ian and his assistant had sex, what the shot was that he gave her, and her ex- being there had no effect on the book at all. very wordy, and cumbersome."
4,Up North Tales,"Very enjoyable collection of essays! My scope of Michigan's off the beaten track treasures was broadened with stories about places like Negaunee, Bois Blanc, Sugar Island and of people like Osborn, Schoolcraft and Fivenson. My evenings were leavened with auroras, polygamists, dancing geese and the difficulties of economic development in places where good folks think twice and then twice more for good measure. Thanks for these McPheesque peeks into our great Lake Country! Worth looking for - a Michigan cottage book shelf keeper that will inspire your own adventures into the history and community of your favorite place or launch your journey of discovery."
1,Poor quality,"The product arrived with pieces that did not fit into the appropriate slots; to make matters worse, one of the four ill-fitting pieces was broken. I had to pay someone to help me put this tower together, and thereby salvage this purchase. It's cheap, poor quality, and not at all worth the price."
5,Best Canister Vacuum Ever!!,"Just received this vacuum today & it is the best I have ever used in 26 years. Absolutely beats out my central vacuum system!! Takes up ALL the dog hair, I cannot emphasize that enough.My rugs look great and so do the hard floors. Handles very easily, rolls itself along, you only need to guide it. Great price, quick shipment, I couldn't be happier."
3,Power Cord not retractable,"Its a very average unit that does not have a retractable power cord.The GoodIt does its job and is light to move around.The BadThe hose does get tangled up very easily much like a cheap garden hose. And again, NO RETRACTABLE POWER CORD."
3,"inexpensive, does its job, has its ""issues""","Given the price that I paid for this device, I am very happy with its performance. It does extremely well on my hardwood floors, and the rotary attachment efficiently cleans my floor rugs.Problems: I didn't think that the non-retractable power cord would bother me, but truthfully it is inconvenient. I also had the problems with the plastic hose doubling over, thereby cutting off the suction to the floor. Thus, although it does a pretty good job, one does have to put up with a few inconveniences. Were I to upgrade (and pay more) I would look at these features. I would also look into getting a device with a HEPA filter which more efficiently removes dust and cat hairs."
4,Great Vacuum at this price,"This vacuum compared with my old Eureka canister vacuum is much better. They both use the same filter bags (style V) but the size of this one is a little bit bigger and lighter.Pros:1. This vacuum has less sound.2. The tool accessories are functional and are stored in the canister.3. The canister is light and is convenient to carry around stairs and to clean blinds, etc.4. This vacuum is convenient to use and has a very good suction for cleaning.Cons:1. The electric cord does not automatically retract.This vacuum does a good job cleaning carpets and we are very satisfied. We would recommend it to all who are looking for this type of vacuum with this price range.Note: The delivering/shipping time is very fast ... and it's free - I received this vacuum within three days."
1,still hasn't been shipped,It has been 20 days since my order was placed. It has yet to ship! Pay no attention to the reviewer who said he got it in 3 days.
1,poor transfers do this set in,"Iknow that sets like this aren't going to look great, but this set is so bad that in some scenes you see nothing and sound drop out will drive you crazy."
5,Get swampy!,One of the better Swamp Thing variants in the series. His accessory is slightly cheesy but the figure more than makes up for it. The color scheme is great and the fact that you can see in between the figure itself is a nice touch. See what would have been featured in a 2nd unaired season of this series.
3,Nice start - but barely a beginning,"Ms. Saeks did a reasonable job, but the book is close to worthless if you want to design your house in a recognizable California Wine Country style. Katya and I suggest developing a color palette from the book, but after tens of hours of studying it we can not determine a quantifiable style. Consider this book as a raw first start; a survey of modest importance. The interiors are all over the map. The only commonality is their location in California. Worth buying - yes, but only to understand the diversity possible. Is a more serious study necessary - yes. California wine country is a combination of Tuscan, Provencal, and Spanish Colonial/Early California, with Asian influences. Themes and moods vary. Pretty much freestyle designing. However, certain rules will give you a recognizable style. We're working on it.- Jim and Katya Preston"
4,Gorgeous source books,"One of the best things about this book is that it covers a range of different types of houses, from modern to Tuscan to rural country, all within the same general color palette and sharing some elements of the wine country style. The Tuscan homes featured, my personal favorites, are truly spectacular and the photography is detailed enough that there are plenty of elements to be used for inspiration if not down-right copied!Visually gorgeous from start to finish even in the styles that may not be your favorites, combines to make a great picture of wine-country style. Warm, relaxing, elegant."
5,Keeping Promises,This book is great for teaching moral values through an interesting story. It keeps the reader particularly engrossed in the character detail as forces of good against evil engage on a level that is all too real. You will find Keeping Promises hard to put down.
4,I wish I had used it more,"This book was great and very user friendly. I knew it had everything (and more) that my text book had. Regardless, I didn't even read the whole thing as I didn't have time too, but the ""rapid review"" was what I completly read. However, I ended up with a 4 on the test. To begin with it is an easy test, but imagine what you can do if you read the whole thing!"
5,"Pyschologically Delicious, Pathologically Malicous","This was an incredible ride. After taking an AP Psychology class, I was looking for a great book to review for the test. 5 month before the exam, I spent an hour everyday reviewing a chapter. When the test day finally came, I breezed through it. I finished 30 minutes before the time ran out and felt pretty confident that I aced the exam. July came around, and I got my score.................After 5 month of consistent review, I got a 1. I know right, a 1? Can you believe that! What kind of idiot gets a 1 after reviewing for so many hours. I knew every question on that test. Only I knew it wrong. Turns out I was studying Physiology. I got the names confused and thought that I was set to study PSYCHOLOGY. Those two are very different. My advice to you is that if you take this exam, make sure you register for Psychology, and not Physiology."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I have had the same problems everyone else complains of: screeching sound (that scares the hell out of you), powering on then off. I read that it was a result of the power supply, so I ordered a new one ($44) and installed it, it still has the same problem. The other part that has been recommended to change is a scaler board ($263) which costs almost as much as the TV did. This TV was great now it sucks...Hard."
1,"less than 9 months, picture tube going.....","I bought this set dec 10. in the last 2 months we've noticed horizontal lines and shadows. I've checked everything according to cable lines. It is the TV set. The service center admitted that this set does have a picture tube problem. they can fix it for $274.00. I bought it originaly for about that price. I'm really angry that it is dying so soon. All other TV's I've ever owned have lasted for many many years! I really liked this set up till this problem. In my opionion, less than one year for your money is not worth it!"
3,"Good picture, very annoying channel change","This set has an annoying 'feature' that was so irritating we returned the set.As you change channels, a large grey status panel comes up, with the language, screen format & sound settings. The panel stays on the screen for 4 seconds.This probably won't happen if you have this hooked up to a cable converter, but if you're pulling straight off antenna or cable, it makes channel surfing intolerable.The picture and sound were fine."
1,Don't even think about buying!!,"Like others have stated, the tv is now a piece of garbage. We had the tv for about a year and a half when it started screeching, then the picture would black out. During this time you cannot control the tv, usually you need to unplug it and restart it. It progressively got worse to the point where there is no longer any picture or sound. Of course the warranty is short so it had run out before the problems started. Unless you have $200 to waste, I would find something else."
1,Avoid,Agree with the others here have had this TV for a couple of years and in the last month or so started the screeching and turning on and off. Searching the internet reveals this isn't an uncommon occurence with this model and has to to do with one or ever multiple power supplies/capacitors and possibly on more than one board. Buyer beware it's more to repair the unit than to buy another TV so only buy this if you are prepared to throw it away in about a year.
1,FAULTY CONSTRUCTION,"It's been about a year since I bought this TV and started having problems with it. I decided to do a little research online and lo and behold, almost EVERYONE else who bought this TV had the same exact problems. Like the others, the TV started to make loud popping noises like a capacitor makes when it explodes. The TV would then repeatedly shut it self off and on again. Don't be fooled by the picture quality, this TV will not last. It astounds me that companies actually sell products like this. I, for one, will never buy anything from Magnavox ever again."
1,OK for its short life,"This TV is fine for an extra TV. WHILE IT WORKED it had OK picture, color, controls, volume etc. Not sure how long I've owned it..2 years maybe. Without warning and while watching, the TV made a load, startling noise, the screen went black, silence....dead. Pretty short life for a few hundred buck occasional use TV. Certainly don't make you want to repurchase or recommend Magnavox."
1,One enormous piece of poo...,"I guess I'm luckier than most owners, since I still get a picture, though it degrades every week. The first problem, and a continuing one, is sound. For some reason the TV just shuts up, and you have to turn it off and on again to get it to talk. Sometimes it just gives a high-pitched howl, which is fixed by turning it off and on again. The color gets really muddy at times, and all in all it's just an enormous piece of crap. We got it when we redid our kitchen, but I will never NEVER buy a Magnavox product again. Their slogan is ""Smart. Very smart."" I was dumb, very dumb to buy this without doing more checking..."
2,wow. from great to crap,"When i first bought it, it was great. Used it for my PC and TV watching. Sadly like most people, 2 yrs later, it started turning off and on with static lines everywhere making screeching noises at random. My warranty was over and i knew i was tricked INSTANTLY. I have had 10 yr old tv's last longer then this one. After reading other peoples review im glad im not alone. Also to those who say it works fine, just wait around til the 2-3 yr mark, it will fail."
1,Avoid like The Plague,"I Bought this TV at Brandsmart and after only a year and four months, I'm having the same problems described by the other reviewers. It turns on and off by itself, the picture shifts from side to side and occasionally, a loud continuous beep comes from the set and won't stop until you turn it off. I have owned two Magnavox tube TV's in the past and they both lasted about eight years a piece. But they clearly don't have LCD technology figured out yet. After spending $300.00 on a lemon that lasted about a year, I feel completely duped. I will never buy another Magnavox product again."
2,it's fixable,"Somebody gave me a broken one of these and I fixed it easily. If you know how to solder, you will be able to fix it.There are three capacitors on the main board that always go bad.Do a web search for the terms 19MF337B C112 C117 C118 and you will find instructions.Replace the bad caps with three EEUFR1C102 aka P14398, costing about $5 total."
1,Don't buy this item,"I bought the Magnavox 19MF337B TV. While the picture quality is good, the unit went bad in 11 months of normal use. It makes a loud popping noise and then shuts down completely. Apparently there are capacitors that go bad in this model, and it dies. I have read the same complaint many places on the web about this model. Since your warranty with Maganavox is only good for 90 days, you are out of luck. Stay away from Magnavox/Phillips TVs. You're wasting your money."
1,Screeches,"I've had this just over two years. Up until about a month ago my biggest complaint was that a couple of channels were fuzzy. Just like others have reported, it started screeching LOUDLY within the last month. Two years is an unreasonable life span for a TV!"
2,"Oh my goodness, seriously?!","TV was purchased two to three years ago and worked fine for about 1 1/2 years. Audio has increasingly gotten worse. Now it is always fuzzy or doesn't work at all. Occassionally makes emergency broadcast type loud horn sound then shuts off. Picture now fuzzy too. And yes, I have checked the cables several times. Given that TV was only purchased a couple years ago, I would not recommend this product and would not be likely to purchase or recommend another Magnavox television. Or, maybe this is the typical lifespan of a flatscreen television?"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Same as the rest. After about a year, it started screeching and rebooting. After warming up it would be OK, but over time the warm up period got longer and longer. It now takes an hour before it settles down enough to watch a movie on the HDMI. Terrible product."
1,Great TV at First.....,"I have had this TV for 2 years now and it is starting to go out already. Its a great size and has good picture quality at first, but now 2 years in things are breaking. When i turn the TV on the picture goes in and out 4 or 5 times with static noise and loud ringing. It takes about 15 minutes to warm up before it will work normally. Many people are having this same problem if you Google this model of the TV. At this point I am no longer in warranty and Magnavox will not help, fix or replace the item. I was hoping to have this TV longer than 2 years...."
4,Powerful Perspective for Dealing with Difficult People,This book was recommended to me. My mind and eyes were opened to the perspective provided. I used the techniques in the book with successful results. Susan's reading of her book was additionally insightful.
4,Very informative.,Everyone should be informed about emotional blackmail - also the people who use it themselves to manipulate others. Unfortunately I should have read this book many years ago.
4,Good Quick Read,A good quick read. Gives information on how to get your power back by using language skills. It works. You really catch the blackmailer off guard when you change your speech pattern.
2,I'm confused by the rave reviews,"This was a decent read for someone completely new to the idea, but a lot of this is common sense and a good deal of the book was dedicated to examples of emotional blackmailers (and their victims) rather than information. The advice it had to offer could have fit in a book a third this length, and only half of that was worth reading. I could see this being helpful as an introduction to some of these issues, but if you're looking for information and ideas beyond the basics, I'd skip this book."
4,Doesn't quite go far enough...,"For a ""boiled down to a minimum"" book, try ""A Primer on Evil."" You may not like thinking of friends and relatives as ""evil,"" but the book lays out a definition of ""bad"" people, where they are found (everywhere), and how to deal with them. Have you ever been one of those people who scribbles notes in the margins of books? This book has room for notes in the back.Good luck."
3,"well written, not enough on dealing with super manipulators","This is a well written and well thought out book on dealing with manipulative people. Most people are going to find this to be very helpful.I am looking for advise on dealing with a well practiced manipulator who lies and uses multiple techniques of control. This book simply did not give me enough information to deal with an extremely practiced manipulator.As another reviewer has said this book assumes your manipulator will listen when you try to talk to them calmly. And for the majority of manipulators these techniques will work.If you are dealing with a person who controls everything you do, every morsel you eat and and pretends you are a child so they have to make all your descisions to protect you, this book will not be much help."
5,Overwhelmingly Helpful!,"I bought this book a few months ago. I read it in a single night. It was so amazing; it felt like I was reading about my life and my family members! This book helped me to identify the different types of control and manipulation people use and how to break free from the vicious cycle. I used this book along with ""If you had controlling parents"" by Dan Neuharth, to get out of the destructive and dysfunctional cycle that my family was in the middle of. I highly recomend both of these books! This particular book works for any controlling and manipulative relationship you might be in---there are lots of stories with examples form real people's lives."
4,Clinical Helper,This pocket guide came in handy when I had to write my care plans for my patients in mental health clinicals. Some of the others wished they had one.
4,Great learning tool,This is a great pocket guide to take on clinicals at the hospital when you're on Psych floors. It is easy to carry in your pocket and very helpful when you need to look up a psych drug or something related to your patient. I like the fact that you can also write on it with pen and it comes off with alcohol pads. That way I don't have to carry paper pads with me too.
5,Very Handy,I am a graduate student and this little handy book is a good study tool. I highly recommend it. It was recommended to me.
3,Too Hard To Follow,The book is a great reference and gives you tons of information that is useful. Unfortunately I need a reference book to help me find anything in this reference book. It is hard to flip to pages and it is too hard to find anything in it.
5,Great little resource,I keep it with me at work. Comes in very handy. A lot of my colleagues have used it and even ordered their own. Nobody can remember everything all the time.
2,Psych notes,This is a nice pocket size book but the print is just too small in it.There's good information in it and it's very colourful. It's hardwearing. Overall I did not like this book due to the small print size but it has lots of good information.
1,Wrong product,"I ordered Ka-me rice crunch crackers, plain. I received Ka-me gluten-free rice crackers, original, all natural. Unfortunately, they have soy products in this cracker and therefore I can't eat it. This looks different from the picture that came with the crackers I ordered. Apparently I can't return the box of crackers."
2,Love rice crackers...just not these,"I eat rice crackers all the time, and I especially like this brand. Usually I get the seaweed or the teriyaki. This time I purchased the original, which was unfortunate. They were very stale and bland tasting. I probably should have sent them back but didn't. I doubt I'll ever order these again."
4,Basics of eBay,"The Official ebay Guide gave me the basics to everything about ebaying. Answered many questions that I had from the past couple of years of ebaying & now wanting to get a whole lot more. This books raised many more questions that the book could answer. However it gave me the basics and left me in search of more detailed information. So, the book is just what it listed a Guide. Now I look for the Handbook to ebay."
2,A good book for the true Ebay beginer!!!!!,"While it is very outdated, it is still a good book for the novice who needs to get there feet wet.This book has all the basic tools you need to get you started in the Ebay experiance but offers nothing to help you once your passed the basics.There are some good tips on listing your items and using HTML code ect.So, if you are already an experianced Ebayer then this book is NOT for you, but if you are a beginer to Ebay then you'll find this book to be very benifical in getting you started."
2,"Fine in 1999, but outdated","This book was probably very good in its day, but eBay has changed so much since it was published that it really doesn't hit things straight on. It has the basics of buying and selling, and is loaded with cute anecdotes. I've had gotten better information with the updated Dummies books on the subject."
1,NOTHING THAT CAN'T BE LEARNED ON EBAY.COM - SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"What a disapointment! From the reviews I had read here, I thought this book would be quite helpful. I have some, but not extensive, experience on eBay, and thought this book could jump me up a level or two. Unless you've never used eBay, and are really afraid of trying it without a printed introduction, don't waste your money on this book. You can learn EVERYTHING in this book -- including how to create an effective ad using HTML -- by simply clicking on links on the eBay site.In sum, there's simply no need for this book. I'm going to sell my copy!"
1,A History of the Past,"I am very disappointed in this book. As most of the information in this book is outdated, this book should be selling on ebay as a collectors item. Much of the information that can be considered useful to the current ebay functionality is common sense. That is, the book did not reveal to me anything that a second or third time user of ebay could not have figure out."
1,New Medical Therapies you already know,"Seems like the miracle you were waiting for. But it is [an inexpensive] leaflet kind of thing, with a overview of some trails on lung cancer. Ask your doctor or surf the web, and you will get better information on pending trails."
4,Lego Star Wars Jabba Barge Sail,"This gift was purchased for our grandson who is 9 years old, he could not stop building until the entire set was complteted. It is a great gift and he was able to do the entire thing all by himself. I would recommend it highly for anyone who loves to do Legos."
5,jaba's sail barge,"Jabba's sail barge is one of the greatest star wars lego sets I have ever gotten.One reason is that it comes with a rare minifigure,skiff Lando Calrissian.Also, it comes with jabba and Han Solo in his white shirt.To conclude,the sail barge is a great addition to any episode 6 lego collection."
3,What happened to the price??,"Wow! I bought this for my son from Amazon in 2006 for $75, and am SHOCKED that it now costs $300 in 2008! I realize this is probably a decision made by Lego and/or LucasFilm, given the recent spike in popularity of the Star Wars franchise. Still, with the current economic climate, there's no excuse for charging $300 for a Lego building set, and we wouldn't be buying it now. Yes, he has really enjoyed this toy, but I refuse to rate it highly nor sing its praises if it might justify such an outrageous selling price."
4,Excellent design and stability.,"This piece stays together than many of the larger Star Wars Lego sets. My 6 year old had no problems building it and, more importantly, has had no issues in keeping it together when moving it around to either play with or display to his friends.One of the best so far."
5,lots of fun,Great book. Filled with lots of games and indexed so that they are easy to find. Could be used for the whole summer.
3,I'd prefer less games but more focused on certain age,"It is OK book, but it has WAY TOO MANY games for different kinds of kids and number of players. Like, if I simply need to entertine my 2 grandsons, I have to go though whole book to find very few games that feet my needs. I would rather recomend this book to kindergarten or preschool / elementary school teachers - to keep kids (quite a group) busy."
4,Great Book,"This is a great book for teachers and parents. It has many ideas for what to do from in the classroom to the backyard, as well as, travel."
5,Everything you need in one book,"Simple, easy to understand instructions for all sorts of games. Most require little or no money and have kept my child and her friends busy on many a rainy day."
3,Let Down,"The CD I recieved did not have the bonus track as listed. The seller also wrote me back saying that it was Amazon's fault for the incorrect track listing on the webpage. He did offer to buy it back and refund S&H both ways. Just really dissapointed, the bonus track was suppose to be a remix of ""Deep Enough"" as played on the first ""Fast & Furious"" movie"
2,Death of a dream,"What the heck happened to Live? I suspect that Ed Kowalczyk has been sampling the same substances as Scott Stap of Creed.""Throwing Copper"" makes my list of desert island music. While I didn't care as much for ""Secret Samedi"", I thought ""The Distance to Here"" was a return to form. The vaguely Christian overtones weren't enough to spoil the vibrancy of that album.And then came ""V"". The variety and experimentation of musical styles are gone. Every song sounds the same, and they all sound like Creed. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I want a Live album, not a Creed album.I have no interest in listening to ""Birds of Pray"" at all. That's how disappointed I am in what Live has become."
1,Save Your Money,"It happens to a lot of great bands as musical trends change: Foreigner, as they delved into the 80's sound, or Rush, with their seminole flop ""Roll the Bones."" This fate has now befallen Live. ""V"" has a few trendy hits on it, and maybe a few songs which will find their way into our long-term memory, as well. But this is not the Live heard on four previous albums. This is Live with the Collective Soul Virus. Shades of psychadelia still soak through, but for the most part, the experiementation with processed disco sounds has not added to Live's robust sound, but taken from it, as they have neglected the rich, full-bodied rock which made them... well, Live. I was hoping they wouldn't pronounce themselves in a rut by producing a third album in a row like the past two, but this is not what I was hoping for."
3,This is not Live,"So many of the reviews mention how great the album is or how terrible it is. Well, it is both. I am glad that they have finally changed their sound some. While I loved their previous albums, I was getting a little tired of the slower, melodic verses with driving guitar choruses. But they have gone too far with this album. Why would they make a song about an after-show party and how someone is missing the party because they went to Jimmy Buffet with their dad? (Transmit You Love) Really, who cares? And the rapping towards the end of Like a Soldier is incredibly stupid. Ballads such as Call Me a Fool and Nobody Knows are fairly boring and only sound good as a relief from the noise. That said, Simple Creed, Deep Enough, Forever May Not Be Long Enough, and Overcome are very strong songs. Any Live fan should buy the album for those 4 songs alone. Still, based on what I expect from Live, it is my most disappointing album of the year."
1,I would give it no stars if possible,"This album is complete garbage. I own all of Live's Cd's, and I thought they were getting better with each album. They took a serious misstep with this one. I will NEVER buy another Live cd until I heard the entire thing. Every song sounds like overproduced, uninspired dribble that I wouldn't listen to even if I was paid to! The lyrics are beyond horrible, especially in quite possibly the worst song in history ""People Like you"". A 3 year old could have written these lyrics (and I think one may have. Since when does naming every singer that you can think of count as lyrics?) I strongly, STRONGLY urge everyone to stay away from this junk. And this is coming from a Live fan! You will want your money back soon after hearing it. And after hearing it, you will want all of the minutes of your life back that you wasted away listening to this. A truly wretched CD."
2,"First song's not bad, but then...","Live's first album Mental Jewelry was pretty good. Then came Throwing Copper which was even better. Then Secret Samadhi was almost as good, though not as popular. I didn't catch anything off the fourth album, but boy does this one dissapoint. Too much going on to really get into any of the music, and the lyrics sound more interested in making a rhyme than a point."
4,i can't hear the dolphin's cry...,"I'd have to say that Live's last album, ""The Distance to Here"" was probably one of the best CDs I've heard in a long while, with Fuel's ""Something Like Human"" being right up there. ( you want a great CD, buy that one, you won't regret it) Live's fifth album, aptly titled ""V"" falls short of their last effort. Although, still better than the majority of the mainstream music available today, this album could be better than it is, if they would have continued in the same direction as ""The Distance to Here"" Their sound in their newest release has the same catchy guitar riffs, yet it is much more overproduced, with not as recognizable melodies that leave you singing long after the song ends. Overall, a decent album."
2,Dissapointed Long-time Fan,"I have been a fan of this band since they called themselves ""Public Affection"" before the release of their first album as Live. I have all of their ablums and I just picked up a copy of their new one ""V"". For the first time I can say that I wish I hadn't wasted my money. The ""Simple Creed"" single isn't too bad, and there are some gleams of hope in ""Flow"" and ""Overcome"" but that's where it ends. If your anything like me you'll listen to the rest of this album with a very confused look on your face. Their previous albums all had such great depth to them in the music and the lyrics. This album just doesn't even come close to their other work."
2,Same group responsible for Throwing Copper? Hardly Seems So.,"With the exception of one bright spot on Secret Samadhi (Gashead), All of LIVE's efforts since ""Throwing Copper"" have been uninspired, ""pop"" tunes, and the latest offering ""V"" is no exception. I realize that rock groups do change, and in some cases, that change has been for the better. But not in this case. As a fan of the rock ""epic"" T.C. remains of my favorite albums of all time. I still get chills when I listen to ""Lightning Crashes"", ""Selling the Drama"", ""Pillar of Davidson"" and of course, ""White, Discussion"". No LIVE album has been this awesome since, and perhaps when that happens, you should just move on..."
4,a big fan of the distance to here reflects on V,"At first listen, I was quite dissapointed with V. I an a huge fan of the work they did on their 1999 release THE DISTANCE TO HERE. However, after listening to it several times, the new album has really grown on me. My only real complaint is that Live seems to be going a little more mainstream with their music. And why must so many of the songs on the album include a rap segment? But other than that, this is a really good album, that I grow more attached to with every listen. Like all Live albums, the album as a whole is better than any individual song, although I really liked ""Forever May Not Be Long Enough."" I would recommend this to any of my friends who listen to alternative music."
4,The best cd they've ever done,"The first time I listened to this cd i couldn't believe it was Live. They've totally changed their sound. And in my opinion its for the better. Live chose to rely on fast and heavy songs,for live anyway, to carry this CD. Instead of their typical ballads like ""dolphins cry"" or ""turn my head"", they just come out and rock(and rap occasinaly). The first single ""simple creed"" should give you a good idea if you want to buy this cd or not. Most of the cd has that kind of tempo and beat. ""OK?"" is my favorite track off of it. It just rocks. But of course their is a ballad or two on the cd, and probably the best ballad of their career ""Overcome"". But mostly this cd is a fast rocker, that Live should be very proud of."
4,What happened?,"I love live to death but what happened? their other CDs like Secret Samadhi, DIstance to Here, throwing copper and such were much better and nice to listen to. this one is a little different and the beat is a little toned down a little. i like it but i like the earlier ones better."
1,Where did they go?,"I fell in love with Live, like lots of other people, when they released Throwing Copper. It is a great album, timid and unsure in some respects, but still a great album. Mental Jewlery is an even better album. So the question i have after listening to V, is, ""Where did they go""? I laughed when i started to listen to this album. I listened to a little more and i laughed even harder. I have no clue what the band is trying to get across. It sounds like they tried to please every listener using lots of different styles. Which is sometimes a good thing. But in oreder for that to be a good thing the band has to sound like they believe in what their doing, and the different styles have to be performed well. You will find neither here. If i could give this album less stars i would."
2,A SimPle AlBum,"This album is kind of a dissapointment for most Live fans. This would have to be the least favourite of mine out of their 5 albums. The only good songs on the album are ""Simple Creed"", ""Deep Enough"", ""Forever May Not Be Long Enough"" and ""Overcome"". If u thought TDTH was there best album, u'll most likely like this album."
3,Grew on me,"3.5 StarsI was eager to buy this album after loving ""forever will not be long enough"" from the mummy returns.Having been spoilt by throwing copper, etc i expected great things.I was a little disappointed in the beginning, Redeeming features being simple creed, deep enough, and forever kept me listening.The album has grown on me, but i find some of the anti commercial lyrics trite and boring. The repeated references to themselves in their lyrics are more at home with wanna be rappers with no following. We all know who LIVE are, are they embarressed about their latest effort that they have to let us know who wrote and sang the song, in case we dont recognise them.Never the less, its very listenable after repeated listening, with Simple creed, deep enough, forever, people like you and overcome retaining my love of this band."
2,Sad end to a glorious row of albums,"Like many others of Live fans I first recognised them on the release of Throwing Copper. I soon bought Mental Jewelry and Secret Samadhi and I still have a hard time figuring out which one of these are the best. They are great!Later on came Distance to Here and I hoped that this would be the low watermark for Live (I admit there are a few good tracks on DtH), but no.This album (V) is nothing like the old Live.Lyrics are stupid love crap. Music is like any other mtv pop. Edward sounds more and more like Michael Jackson...My advice: Stick with the earlier records."
1,V: Throwing Aluminum Foil?,"I just bought ""V"" from a corner record store in Washington, DC. Good thing they also trade used CDs there, because I think this one's headed for the bargain bin, fast.""V""'s soft vanilla syrup supplants Live's exciting, anthemic, hard-driving, on-the-edge, wife-tells-me-to-turn-it-down rock of yesterday. Something's wrong when you keep thinking, well, the next song's gotta be better. Not much in the way of melody, not much in the way of good music.A tell-tale sign of desperation is how the group's promoters still keep trying to hype ""V"" by linking ""Overcome"" lyrics to the 9-11 trajedy: Kinda cheesy, guys. You are a great rock band. Just do it.Everyone else should pass on this one and hold out hope for ""VI."""
2,Not a typical Live Offering,"If you like the guitar driven sound of past Live albums you'll be disapointed with this release. It's very electronica and over produced. Some albumes take time to grow on you, this get worst with ever listen. Buy the new Birds of Prey album if your looking for some new Live."
4,Great,"i just go finished listening to V from live, and despite alot of the negative reviews from a good portion of people, i like this cd. yes its defintely different from what live has done before, but when a band constantly churns out the same thing over and over, with no originality, the quickly go the way of the dinosaur. theres nothing wrong with trying something new and different. thats what live does here. if you go in with negative thoughts your gonna leave with negative thoughts. if you keep an open mind you will defintely like this cd. Simple creed is a catchy song with catchy lyrics and the albumn is different from start to finish. surely a great listen"
3,Runs Hot and Cold,"I've been a big fan and originally the rap thing was distracting. But I found myself going back to the first five songs and ""Flow"" on a regular basis, skipping the sappy ballads as soon as I hear them start. I've always enjoyed the guitar-driven music that Live is known for, but it was some of the lyrics that put me off. ""In the West, we think we're the best"" seems like a grade-school taunt rather than the insightful view into Eastern culture that the song is supposed to carry. Nevertheless, the first few songs are as good as any they've done. Just overlook the others.These guys need to be allowed one or two aberrations from their original work, just like any artist. But Live needs to return to PA, spend some time in their old neigborhoods, and get their origins back."
2,Live as viewed through a dirty glass,"As ""Secret Samadhi"" and ""Distance to here"" were -good-, this is -bad-. Feels as if Live got dilluted in a railway cistern of Coca-Cola, the ugly spirit of New Metal is at the helm in the locomotive, and Britney Spears is shoveling coal. They've tried experimented with sound in multiple ways, and almost every tweak missed it. Basically, not good.Not recommended even to a fan, unless curious about how bad can a good band turn. Hopefully they'll recover."
2,I can't believe live put this alblum out,"Normally I have nothing but praise for live. I own all there cd's and have never been dissapointed with any of their music. I even like Secret Samadhi, which I know a lot of fans dislike. There are maybe three songs that I like on this disc. simple creed, deep enough and call me a fool are quite good, which is the reason I gave it even two stars. The rest of the songs sound forced, overproduced. The emotion dosen't ring true in these songs as it does on all their previous alblums. I don't want another Throwing Copper, I just want an alblum that has consistently good tunes."
4,"Another fine effort from Live, but not their best","I rushed out yesterday to get this CD and was expecting a whole lot. For the most part Live delivered, but in some ways, they didn't.As usual, the songs have catchy hooks (I am unable to get ""Deep Enough"" and ""Simple Creed"" out of my head). However, the lyrics are just mediocre. In some songs, they promoted themselves. In other songs, they dissed Jimmy Buffett, Starbucks, and Pizza Hut. To me, that is the ultimate in cheesiness.Lyrics were much betterer in songs like ""Overcome."" ""Overcome"" is possibly the strongest song on the album, and reminiscent of ballads on ""Throwing Copper"" and ""Mental Jewelry.""If you liked Live's earlier albums but not ""Secret Samadhi"" or ""The Distance to Here,"" there's a chance you might not like this album... borrow it from a friend first. If ""Secret Samadhi"" and ""The Distance to Here"" were your cup of tea, look into this album. But if you like all of Live, this is one CD that should definitely be added to your collection."
3,Operation Stupid!,"I remember sitting at a party in High School telling the room to shut up so that I could watch the Live video for ""Operation Spirit."" I have loved these guys since that moment. The refreshingly different sound and heartfelt lyrics have been a sort of sound track for my life.That is why I was shocked at the dull and unimaginative album. It sounds like a hurried combination of Live's traditional sound and a Limp Biscuit B-side. How could this great band go from leaders in the alternative rock movement to rap-rock rip offs?Get ""Throwing Copper"", ""Mental Jewelry"", and ""The Distance to Here"" in that order. You will be impressed by the versatility and consistency of this great band. I would also suggest Far Too Jones and Lifehouse for your fix of alternative-pop-rock."
1,Ed's suffered a head injury,"I love how the folks who've heard ""Mental Jewelry"" and ""Throwing Copper"" notice how the lyrics on 'V' lack any real meaning, while others actually take the space here to discuss the very deep meaning of the very same lyrics! 'Yeah baby is he *deep* enough for you <wink wink>' Author!Author! I suppose Mutt Lange will be their next producer and will Shania-fy / Corrs-ify their next release, which will no doubt be a big hit on those ""Mix-"" stations. ...""Throwing Copper"" was one of the most solid and complete musical releases from any band, I've ever heard, period. A work for the ages. It very nearly makes me cry that it's come to this; the real tears flow when I realize other people think that THIS effort is brilliant."
2,Live falls flat.,"It's unfortunate that a band so talented as Live would release an album so weak. It is almost as though they produced this one just to get airplay on the shamefull pop stations that plague us today.The first track is good. Classic live. The rest are painful to listen to.I'm happy to see that I am not the only one to recognize the anti-western theme carried throughout much of the album.Mental Jewelry, Throwing Copper, Secret Samahdi, and The Distance to Here were each well-crafted works. V is just not the Live that I have grown to admire over the years.I actually find myself feeling embarrassed when listening to this."
1,What a f^&*king disappointment,"Live has made 5 albums. Out of which 2 can be considered great(throwing copper, the distance....). On V, their fifth album, they seem to have lost the magic of their previous efforts. There is not one decent song of the 14 here. Why tricky appears on it is beyond me. They dont even have a great single here that the lesser albums even had. Of course its hard to catch lightning in a bottle often like they did with lightning crashes, i alone, the dolphins cry etc. but come the F%%K ON this is a half assed effort. I wonder if they even cared bout it. And ed should shave his head again cause he is balding anyway. I really hope these guys can rebound or it might be lights out for live"
3,An unnecessary new direction for Live,"With V Live tries a rap/rock sound in order to become popular with younger people. Unfortunately, they've alienated their current fan base in the process. High points of the album include Simple Creed, Call Me A Fool, and Overcome. These tracks demonstrate what has made Live so popular. However, Transmit Your Love and People Like You show lyric problems that were first seen on Secret Samadhi. It's obvious that Live made a lot of mistakes in musical style when recording this album and should be trying to expand their own sound rather than try to latch on to a music trend. This band is better than Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park and they don't need to emulate their music."
1,Reviewing the new Live album.,"Another one from live as the musical world, waits?....no, anticipates?...no, no, how about DOESNT EVEN NOTICE :)The album has been out for 2 days now, and I get the first review, well hear it goes ---> When is someone going to put Ed Kowalczyk out of our misery. Its enough already, stop waisting the recording space. You want a review for real? It sounds like nothing.By the way, who really wrote Throwing Copper?"
1,Flop,"This will possibly be Live's first flop. The same beat but not as catchy, nothing really outstanding here. But the guy's can still rock in their concerts!"
1,"If you're a Live fan, you might want to skip this one...","I'm not sure if someone started taking their ""happy pills"" or not, but there's only one good track on this CD-- the first one. It's almost like the writers for the Backstreet Boys decided to try their hand at rock music. It just didn't work. Buy the single for Simple Creed and pretend that's all they released."
4,Great new album,The new Live album. V. A fine piece of art. No Live fan will walk away unsatisfied. More happy music than 'the distance to here'. Just go buy this album. It is great.
3,"This was, unfortunately, and average album.","Granted, I shouldn't base my review upon their previous work, but being proud to say Throwing Copper is my favorite album, by any band, it's hard not to judge them a little based on past work. This isn't a great album, but it's certainly a good one, inevitably worth the $13 I spent. It seems forced, and perhaps to generic at times(too often), but there are a handful of songs on the album which are truly worth listening to. But hey, although I encourage experimentation in music, this isn't the direction the band should head in... and owning all 5 CD's, I think I may have the ability to form a definitive opinion, I'm not spouting off. Well, bye now."
3,A new low; and a bitter disappointment.,"Since hitting their creative, musical and lyrical high water mark with ""Throwing Copper"" in 1994, Live has been going progressively downhill. And with ""V"", they've hit rock bottom. To go any lower, they're gonna have to start digging.Just a few years ago, Live was arguably my favorite band. Throwing Copper was amazing, and remains one of the best albums recorded in the 1990's. ""Secret Samadhi"", the followup to ""Copper"", was good, but easily a couple of notches below the heights achieved on ""Copper."" The radio pre-release of ""The Dolphin's Cry"", the harbinger of ""The Distance to Here"", seemed to promise that Live had recaptured their prime form; but alas, there were no other tracks on ""Distance"" that were comparable to ""Dolphin's Cry.""Still, when ""V"" was released, I could not resist buying it. If you're similarly tempted, don't waste your money. ""V"" is awful, even by the standards of a longtime Live fan..."
3,Another solid outing from a great band.,"Is it any wonder that Live has survived this long while most alt rock bands have tanked? I'm originally from York Pa where Live is from and I remember when nobody knew them and they were great then. They are sincere in everything they do and deserve all the success they get. Reveiwers are naturally cynical and fickle. They like you today than dislike you tommorrow. Live is a band for the fans and not critics as should every rock band. Granted, this is not there strongest. It sounds like outtakes from The Distance to Here and that's all right. It's by no means bad either. Like there name strongly suggests, Live are at there best live! I saw them several times, and each time they rocked the house. Should a band that has five albums only be judged on their last album? Of course not! Live is a survivor and a great 'alternative' to all the fluff out there. I wish them all the continued success they deserve."
5,Felicitous combination of rock and melody,"The discrepency between the public and my own ratingmade me write this review. Not knowing ""Live"" I had noexpectations when I first listed no their album ""V"". Itfascinated me so much that I didn't skip a single track.It was the comination of melody and rock that arrest myattention. A bit surprising for an alternative rock band isthe high pitch with which some of the passages are sung.""Live"" can indeed be compared with REM, but on ""V"" themelancholy is absent that is characteristic for REM andthe former albums of ""Live"". Maybe someone may find thelyrics are bit trashy (e.g. in ""soldier of love""), butI like them.An innovative album and my fovorite album of 2001.My recommendation: Buy it or check it out, at least."
3,kill the keyboardist,Live used to write good guitar driven rock with mysterious vocals about love and other things only Ed understood. now they rely on a keyboard and Ed nonexistence talent at writing rap lyrics. Come on Ed has a great voice no use in wasting it on rap.This cd i found seemed very rushed for the boys in live. It was as if they thought the new wave of music was washing them away and they need to hurry up and catch up. The well thought out music that is found in all other live albums is not there. ed has even sunken to the depths of talking about his bad. I mean come on who cares that its the seventh game every night with live. What live needs on the next album is more solos and absolutely no more keyboards.I am a huge live fan and this album does have its good songs (the ride and flow). Its even alright to listen too but not that much you can easily get sick of ed's lyrics on this one.Live may win new fans with this (I doubt it) but I question whether they will keep their old ones.
5,COME ON!!,"Geez! You people are being so tough on this great band. So it's a little different, but couldn't you see it coming on The Distance To Here? That was harder! I think the lower rated people need to realize the days of Throwing Copper are over, and they need to listen to how far Live has really gone! THANK YOU"
2,I hate to say it...,"After having heard what Live are capable of, most of ""V"" just feels like a joke. The music is overproduced and seems uninspired, and the lyrics are quite often laughable (""Where the boys in Live? They're pissin' in the mainstream""). And don't even get me started on the disaster that is ""Deep Enough""...There's not much more to say than that. ""Overcome"" is a hidden gem; a glimpse of what ""V"" should have been. But sadly, it's the only redeeming song."
1,What were they thinking?,"A long fall frome the days of Mental Jewelry and Throwing Copper. I tried and tried again to let this album grow on me, but I eventually threw it away. These guys need to take a step back and listen to the albums that got them noticed in the first place! Don't waste your time on this one..."
2,Too Much Pop and Hip Hop Influence,"Has Live suddenly become Limp Bizkit or what? The first song was appalling to me, but I just told myself ""it's going to get better,"" but believe it or not it never did, well at least until the end. I bought the cd in the first place because of track 13 (Overcome), which is quite possibly the best single they have released since Lightning Crashes, but now I wish I had waited for its single to be released. Save your money by downloading the only decent song on their, and let's pray that the band approaches the next album with less of the teenybop flavor and returns to their old and treasured style."
1,"""v"" makes me sad","i love live's music and lyrics but what they try to pawn off as substance in ""v"" comes across more like the manufactured pop/rock/punk that infects the current music scene. musically, ""v"" reminded me more of ""punk"" or ""rock"" stylings of blink182 or creed or any of the other bands that your can't tell apart from each other. lyrically, ""v"" is a sub-par outing for a writer that showed great artistic promise. ideologically, ""v"" gives the impression that live is just going through the motions. the musical, lyrical, and ideological progression of live has been an interesting journey. ""v,"" though, is a pathetic shadow of the previous four albums."
5,Live V,"What a terrific album! The beautiful music and powerful lyrics remind me of Live's ""Mental Jewelry"" album. I loved every song. I heard the song ""Overcome"" on a VH1 tribute to the tragedy in New York on 9-11. The song still moves me to tearsas I recall the images that accompanied this moving song.I have always been a fan of Live and this album is one of my favorites."
1,LIVE-V,"What a shame. Live are one of the best bands of all time. They are also outstanding in concert. Their first three albums (especially the underrated third, ""Black"" album) are brilliant and raw. The fourth album took a more peaceful tone, and all the songs sound alike, but it's outstanding, anyway. But this new one is a travesty. I respect them for doing something different, but this is a horrible record, plain and simple. I think a few years down the road, when the band has made a few more albums, they'll look back and disown this one, and not play any songs from it anymore. They're a great band, and I respect them, but by any stretch of the imagination, this is a black mark on an otherwise brilliant career."
2,Lacking any sort of substance...,"...well, at least musically and lyrically (other substances are questionable). The music of Live has sadly deteriorated over the past few years; V is a hodge-podge of synthesized beats and lyrics substandard to their earliest adolescent works. Ed's voice is knocked into the Timberlake-tones while attempting, um, rap (?). It's somewhat disappointing to see yet another alternative band attempting to conform their work to the teeny-boppin' world of pop. Sometimes Sting and sometimes Limp Bizkit and sometimes Polka (I wish), this seems to be quite a confused ""party"" album.The two stars can be attributed solely to ""Overcome"", a beautiful ballad that was written, coincidentally, quite a few years ago. A definite download for an MP3, anyway.If you're somewhat unsure of the music of ""Live"", I suggest you look into Secret Samadhi; their most passionate, guitar-driven album to date. That fully demonstrates the REAL Live."
3,Very different,"It's hard to blame Live for taking a completely different approach with this album. After their last album (arguably their best work to date) ""The Distance to Here"" recieved only luke warm record sales.This CD is very different from all previous live works, attemptiong to fuse eastern and mid-eastern music with industrial-rap like that of Linkin Park mixed with Live's own sound, a good attempt at something completely different, but it's all the traditional Live sounding tracks that save this CD from being complete garbage.Sweet spots are:Forever may not be long enoughFlowOvercomeHero of Love"
1,A Bad Album by a Great Band,"I guess even Mozart wrote some drivel in his days... but at least he had the wherewithall to throw it away before anyone saw it. Live is a great band, but this is an album that should never have been made. All of their albums are good, though one could argue a slight downward slope after Throwing Copper. But this album falls like the stockmarket of 2000. Over-produced and pretentious, this album is an embarassment to their discography. Unfortunately, there is no superman to turn back time and un-make it."
5,V is Live,"This album is one of Live's greatest. I feel throughout this album that the depth and rhythm and soul that Live has created here really touches the heart of everyone. I really edjoy Ed's soft high voice. And the song ""Overcome"" hits upon a nerve in the public that brings awe and wonder of the great need that we all have to compassion and grace. I felt uplifted after listening to this album. I also danced in abandonment."
2,A New Direction for Live,"This is definitely something different, and I commend the boys in Live for trying to evolve as a band instead of trying to make another ""Throwing Copper."" Unfortunately, their ""evolution"" is not in any innovative or creative direction, but instead towards a tedious mainstream rap-rock combination that's been done to death by the likes of Limp Bizkit. The album has a few standout tracks: ""Simple Creed"" (where the hip-hop Tricky cameo is actually interesting), and the good but melodramatic song ""Overcome""."
4,Call Me A Fool,A very good album by a very good band. I may not always like some of the things Live does but they are always interesting.Even on a bad day better than most bands on the planet.
2,Disappointment,"I believe I received a used product . . . Although now I don't remember. While the product was shipped in a timely manner and quite intact, it only worked for about 3 months. The battery had failed. Replacement batteries weren't that expensive. It was just tremendously inconvenient!"
4,Packed with info you won't find any where else,"The DVD is Doc presenting his material. It's not a slick production. He at times gets a little animated when the materials leans into his Christian faith (I'm not a Christian). But setting that aside, his knowledge of the material and what he shows you is extremely impressive. His knowledge of Masonry, Rosicrucians, the Illuminati will be very, very difficult to find in any DVD (I know - I have tried). You would need to read many of the source books referenced in this video. It's around 2.5 hours (2 discs) and even though it's a bit quirky it contains a plethora of information."
2,A little frustrating,"We do not ""homeschool"" but I wanted to use this book to teach my daughter Latin as a supplement to what she's learning in school. So far I have found it to be frustrating. Mostly because all the words are not defined. I have been having her translate the cartoons but she is not able to do it completely because of the lack of definitions. It would also be helpful to have a comprehensive glossary at the end. I have a Latin dictionary but it's not terribly helpful. For instance, they introduce ""est"" but none of the tenses. So along comes ""erit"" and I'm not sure how they're supposed to know that that is the future tense and means ""is going to be""? And ""erit"" is not in the Latin dictionary. I am now going to have to sit down and write up a spreadsheet with definitions of all the words.The mouse is cute and I like the addition of Roman culture and history."
4,Minimus Pupil's Book,"I'm teaching Latin to my eight year old daughter and her eight year old friend. I'm not used to teaching this age group, but this book is making it pretty easy. They enjoy the comics, especially if I have them act them out, and they remember the lines afterward; they don't even mind the vocabulary drills. The only real ""work"" on my part is writing one-two page Latin stories or mini-histories so they can get some practice translating and reading Latin prose."
2,this is a child's beginner book,Probably excellent for a child but no good for an adult beginner. My mistake.
5,"Very educational, Kinda Easy","Salvete OmnesHello everyoneThis book is a great way to learn Latin. There are comics that help you with Latin dialogue, and there are also activities that help your vocabulary. The book is kind of easy though and is better for ages five through ten. By the way, Minimus Secundus is coming out soon."
2,I wanted to like this book,"I wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, it isn't merely a problem of the reasoning being flawed, it isn't even, well, reasonable!Buy this book if you want random stories about how wealthy East Coast women feel about how men are boys. Skip this book if you want a reasoned argument about feminism."
4,Great tool for the part-time mechanic,"Boy, using a transmission jack sure makes trans removal and then alignment with the engine easier. This tool is well worth the price. The jack and table itself is sturdy and easily held a large diesel pickup transmission. The chain and tensioner is pretty cheesy. I use a ratcheting strap instead."
2,Is It Bait And Switch?,"The parts list in the operation manual and the actual jack you receive do not match. This is a cheaper version with the same model numbers. 1. angle brackets,no holes 2.No Hook Guides 3.1 chain not two 4.oil leak at cylinder pump on first use. I will call manufacturerfor parts. If I do not get them, then jack goes back."
2,A trip in the wayback machine to 1997,"This book gives a great impression of what the internet looked like in 1997. The book has a chapter on searching that does not mention Google. I had forgotten that AltaVista use to belong to DEC. It mentions pointcast, one of my favorite internet boom companies. The book also describes future business models for CompuServe and AOL.It is (vaguely) interesting to read about how things looked back then, and the book does talk about the impact of hypertext on the way we read. It briefly references rhetoric of hypertext, but not by that name. Although the title might have been a good one in 1997, it is not about what I think of as digital literacy in 2009."
2,Short working life but cheap,"I recently used these cut-off wheels on to remove 4 wheels from a welding bench and although the area to be cut was about 1/2"" in diameter it took 4 and 1/2 of the Norton cutoff wheels to remove the four caster wheels from the bench. These are very thin cut-off wheels which is a good thing in that they will fit in tight spaces and cut a minimal amount of material.The material used though wears down rapidly when cutting steel so plan on having a pack or two on hand before starting a job. With the rapid wear the diameter and thus the reach of the cutting wheel is reduced very quickly. You will start out with only 1"" of cutting depth and this diminishes rapidly with the Norton cutoff wheel."
1,Total waste of money,"This is the worst piece of junk I have ever wasted money on. It has never worked well, except the first time I turned it on. I had to replace the brush roller in the first few months. The bags are tiny and it takes two or more to vacuum the whole house. This machine is useless in a house with dogs and carpet. I am going out today to buy another brand of vacuum and a sledge hammer for this one."
1,classic family movies,This is NOT the Heidi with Shirley Temple as the picture on the cover leads you to believe! That is the only reason I bought this DVD and I did not get the one film I wanted!
5,Excellent Teacher Resource,"This is geared toward PK-1 levels but, younger children may learn from the concepts. Simple words and pictures in black and white are easy for copies.It is a great book to introduce nature,ecology, and conservation. A definite for Earth Day.If you have young children or work with children functioning on these levels, it is a great resource. Bilingual and Special Ed teachers can also use this as a vocabulary-hands-on resource! Worth all the money I will spend on it! EXCELLENT!"
5,BUY IT!,"The Graceful Lie is a thoroughly refreshing textbook. Not only is the textbook educational, it is also entertaining. Mr. Petracca skillfully guides the reader through the seemingly endless maze of fiction writing with wit and humor. This is one textbook that will not put the reader to sleep. Take it from a student who has had to pour through numerous textbooks, The Graceful Lie is a textbook that is well worth its price!"
2,Interesting subject boringly rendered,"This could've been a most interesting subjects. Besides, I don't think many people have written on this amusing topic. Unfortunately, the authors of this book has succeeded to make it a boring tome that can have only limited appeal to both the casual readers and academics."
3,Lots of words,"I've been on Nielsen's mailing list for a couple years now and supported most of what he said, so I bought this book thinking I'd get more good info. There is a lot of information in this book, but I was so dry all I can think was how much ""easier"" Steve Krug'sDon't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Editionwas to read. So, I ended up only skimming through 2/3s of the book. Now, when I start a new project and want to touch up on my usability principles, it is Steve's book I reach for, not Nielsen's. I hope others can get more out of it."
5,A Most Important Book,"If you have a web site or are in the process of building one, I would HIGHLY recommend that one of the first things you do is pick up Jakob Nielsen's and Hoa Loranger's book Prioritizing Web Usability. This is the most important book I have ever read on Web sites. (Of course, I also thought this about one of Jakob's previous books-Designing Web Usability!) It is a very enjoyable read and a difficult book to put down. This is the real work. Lots of brilliant psychology and ideas that I guarantee you will use and I can assure you, your business online will benefit after you read it AND it and implement the ideas. I cannot emphasize enough how good this book is. Absolutely brilliant.From the preface: If you are considering whether this book contains information that is useful to you, the key question to ask yourself is: Are users trying to accomplish something when they visit my site? If the answer is ""yes,"" then you should be concerned about usability."
4,"Great book, but a bit US oriented","This is a great book (bible?) when it comes to usability issues. Reading is easy if you're not totaly new to using and coding websites.The only ""downside"" to this book is that it is very US website oriented. As web design/usability in the US is way behind Europe and especialy Scandinavia many of the design/GUI examples in the book feels ""old school"".If you are into improving usability for websites - buy this book!"
4,Useability for the web - not for print,Great conent about web useaibilty but poorly presented in print. Could have had better page layout and organisation
1,Title is misleading!!!,"This movies sucks big time!!! This movie was about hip hop and the study of HIV, and it did not answer any HIV questions for me.It was blahhhh, boring, and I did not learn anything. It was not a documentary or anything close to it. All I know it was a waste of my money and time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"They do not fit, I called the manufacturer and complained!",Does not fit. I called the manufacturer and complained. They sent my complaint to an engineer there. Said they will look into it.
1,It's a shame I can't rate this book with zero stars,"Not only has Mr. Pino little understanding of Aikido, he almost seems to have even less understanding of marketing. Otherwise he wouldn't have borrowed so many concepts that have been written down a long time ago by many authors on marketing. I am quite surprised that some people have rated this book with 5 stars. Is it a coincidence that some of these guys live in Chicago and Rotterdam, two of the places where Mr. Pino has offices? I'm afraid to write it down, but it might be that Mr. Pino has asked all his friends to rate his book with 5 stars. It certainly is the most obvious explanation: The contents of the book does not justify a higher score than 1 star."
5,Robert Pino changes your view on strategy!,After seeing Robert Pino's appearance on CNN I bought the book. Awesome! The way he gives senior executives a fresh look at strategy and how they can guide their employees to achieve the company's purpose is well worth reading.
3,Good but could be better,"When I first saw this book I was expecting a complete explanation of Aikido and its application in the world of business. Although there is a brief explanation about this millenar art, I found it very basic. Its application to business could be better and clearer. It's not a waste of time but needs some improvement."
5,Honor is relationships is the key.,I think the author is spot on when he (and she) say that honor is the key to human relationship problems. Teaching your children and yourself to honor other people and thus themselves is a message we desperately need to hear once again in our generation. The authors use personal examples for consideration that are common situations that most families find themselves in. Ideas for implementation are excellent.
3,Not as much reference to the Bible as I'd hoped.,"I read this book along with ""Don't Make Me Count to Three: a Mom's Look at Heart-Oriented Discipline"" and wasn't as impressed with this one. It looked at discipline more from a psycologist's standpoint and less from what the Bible has to say about parenting (which is a lot!). While I agree that children should honor their parents and others and this is a good habit for kids to have, I don't think it's the heart of the matter. Scripture says that our sinful hearts are bent toward selfishness and children need to see their actions as sinful, not just dishonoring.I recommend ""Don't Make Me Count to Three"" over this one if you want clear Biblical guidelines on parenting with lots of references to Scripture."
4,Interesting advices,"The book is good and it has very interesting approaches and advices.Sometimes the authors emphasize to much on religion, and this (from my point of view) reduce the scientific value of the work."
5,GREAT parenting book!,"I heard about this book through my church Sunday School class. It is GREAT! Offers wonderful and practical advice on how to parent to the ""heart"" of the child. Teaches parents the difference between a child ""respecting"" his parents and a child ""honoring"" her parents. I've read MANY parenting books but this one really opened my eyes up. Am I disciplining just to get the right response and just to ""look"" like a good parent? Or am I truly teaching my children the right behavior through the right attitude? Most helpful book. You won't be disappointed! PS - Our church also used teaching video made to accompany book (sold seperately)..it was *okay*...the book is MUCH more useful.)"
5,Un Cuento para Todo el Mundo!,"Este libro es algo bien especial. En los anos pasados, lo he recomendado a mucha gente: a otros maestros, como yo, a mis estudiantes, a los presos a quienes escribo en la prision en la Bahia del Pelicano. A todos les gustaba este cuento magnifico. Es seguro que usted va a disfrutarse -- y llorar y reflejar y reir -- cuando lo lee. Que tenga un viaje maravilloso!"
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I love David Byrne's music and love the collaborations with Brian Eno. I decided to give this album a shot and it has some good songs and some okay songs. For me, it was not one of my better purchased but you should be your own judge"
2,Too ambitious,"The author try's to cram an entire undergraduate course in Abstract algebra into the first 30 pages and the exercises are, by and large, much too difficult and have only a peripheral relationship to the text. Not suitable for a first course in advanced calculus."
2,A very Big Ego,"While this was a well made documentary, I found the story less then impressive. If I wanted to listen to a criminal brag about how great they were I would just watch COPS."
1,A very British Gangster,"I was puzzled when I watched this. At first, I thought that the DvD may have had the wrong program on it. THis was more of a pulp documentary than a movie. IT was NOT more terrifying than SCAR FACE. It was hard to stay awake through it, as well. I even doubt the honesty and I suspect a lot of exaggeration was written into the lines of the subjects portrayed in this ""movie""... sorry, I wasn't happy with this purchase. Maybe it is just me? I don't know. Scotty/Sioux City"
2,Not very truthful but is funny when it is not supposed to be,"Noonan is not British. He is Irish and he is anti-British. True, he is probably quite a hard-nut. But I don't know what this documentary was trying to say. But he is certainly not a 'very British' gangster at all. Quite the opposite, in fact.And by the way, that bloke who thinks he will one day become an 'actor' is very funny, indeed. Good luck to you, mate. Perhaps you could become a comedian instead?"
1,A very British pounce!,"Oh god! you can go to your local ghetto to see the same thing!The head Noonan is a poof=(GAY) withA bunch of young Adolesent boys doing crimes with him and his brothers,.They ride -round town putting things (RIGHT) IN tha- ""MANOR"" slash HOOD; that consists of Boarded up Buildings w dirty little children playing football in the streets,LOOK AT ANY CITY or PLACEWHERE THE (POOR)RESIDE OR BUY THE FILM,ITS YOUR CHOICE!!!"
1,"This is a comedy, not a documentary.","The premise of this documentary could honestly be turned into a comedic masterpiece. The homosexual british gangster who arrogantly preaches his illegal activities to the world, going around and solving petty issues with his ""hard"" crew of neighborhood teenagers. Why would he ever agree to make this movie? He's a retard, that's why. The real gangsters don't need to open their mouths in order to attain the respect of those around them. This moron constantly runs his mouth so that he can prove to his community that he's a ""gangster"" not to be reckoned with. Within the first 10 minutes you realize he's not really much of a gangster. He's British.Watch it. You're in for a good laugh."
1,A Very British Gangster,It is very British To be Gangster? or to mangle the English Language? I mean you guys Basically Invented it?Is it British to be Proud to be Gay? What is so Cool about this particular Gangster? And who cares what good does he do for the community? How can he be A Catholic If he is a Criminal of the lowest Denominator? that he may be bold and crass and so many other things but that he is nothing but a street goon who needs to be behind bars.Hanging out with Small Kids who smoke all young boys? The best thing about this is the Lesson CRIME DOES NOT PAY.
1,ain't in to koolots,"I'm disgusted with myself for ordering clothes online. It would've been helpful if the website had said there was no enter lining. Now, I have always worn ""large"" (have a fat ass from sitting in front of a computer for years) but these things fit like a long skirt. My wife didn't even laugh, they looked so stupid. Crotch hung at my knees and hem near my ankles. They were still too long when I ""Urkled"" them. In this ""one-size fits"" world these still have no resemblance to a ""fit""; nor do they make a good rag for washing the car. Website gave me nothing better-fitting to choose from nor enough information to know what I was getting."
4,Irish Rock Has More to Offer than U2,"JJ72 released their debut album 18 months ago, and it's still trying to find its way to the general public in the US, nevermind that it's 3 singles found some success in the UK (""October Swimming"", ""Oxygen"" and ""Snow""). Tireless touring (opening for among others Coldplay and the Stereophonics here in the US) will hopefully change that.The JJ72 sound is a mix of hard rock and intimate songs, and it works very well. ""Oxygen"" typifies the sound, and it soars. The album also contains several very intimate songs, just band leader Mark Greany on accoustic guitar.Considering all the drivvle we hear on the radio today, one can only exasperate that this album cannot find a larger audience. I can't wait for the next JJ72 album (supposedly out later this year). And seeing U2 winning all those Grammys last week, we shouldn't forget that Ireland has more to offer than U2. JJ72 proves it with this excellent album!"
2,Warcraft3,"The most bogus game blizzard has come up with. For all the pre release hype it is not worth it. Not much improved from 2, with the exception of graphics. Some of the characters resemble diablo-expansion pack. Restriction of resouces for the full army is wrong, deduct from the account and not from the primary resource rate. The heros are good, but in all the game is boring. Liked Empire Earth much more. In some not worth the $$$."
1,Lacking in every Way...,"The story was predictable. The playablility was weak. The challenge was even worse. This is a build, run and kill. No thinking, no planning and no role playing. What kind of game was this? It was a way for us to interact in a VERY limited way with someones attempt at a story line. The only thing I liked was the way the heros were run."
5,Best Real Time Strategy Game,WarCraft III is the best real time strategy game I've played. I was deeply impressed by the integration of the storyline into the game.
5,The Best Game,This is the best game i've ever played.The four different races are amazing.The graphics are amazing too.This game should be gotten by everyone.
5,The Game of All Games,I have not played this game yet but I know already that this game will be the top selling game of all time. I strongly urge you to buy this collectors edition because you will not be able to get it after it is gone. This is a definate must buy and you will not regret the investment made. This game is the final continuation of the Warcraft Series. Please buy this game. Bliizard North desserves all the support it can get for its ...games. ......
1,This Game...,"this was the worst game i ever played, it was worse than jar jar binks: greatest jedi knight ever, i think blizzard should just quit making games. I have 2 words for the developers of this game:..."
2,Not as good as could be...,"This isn't a Role Playing Game. It is an action game, a quite boring action game. One has little to no control of anything going on in the game. Graphics are nice and the pan option is great, but what else? I miss the old RPGs where you could make choices. I do have to say that the cinematic sequences are amazing. Even on an 8mb video card. Sigh..."
5,It will be worth every penny!,"This Is a must have for anyone who loves Warcraft. The collectors edition will give you the game, a dvd with all the in game movies, a warcraft 3 soundtrack, a signed collector edition manual, four limited editon 8""by10"" cards of the four player races and a coffee table book.As for the game itself im sure its going to be good ive been playing the multiplayer beta for a while now and everything is going good."
1,Boring Game,"Warcraft 3 is the most boring game I've ever seen. The graphics stink and the game is way too short. To add, online play is terrible. The first two were much better than this. And the heros are terrible, every mode u play over and over again. It all repeats itself. I wouldn't get this game!"
2,Not all that great...,"I liked Starcraft a lot, so when Warcraft 3 came out i decided to try it out. I was kinda disappointed.1) The 3D graphics and engine that were supposed to be awesome really aren't...they're average...but not great as touted. This game is only a bit more 3D than Starcraft.2) The overall look of this game is not what Warcraft is suppossed to look, i.e dark, gothic, and semi-realistic. Lets face it guys, the actual gameplay in this game looks like a CARTOON!3) The hero system extremely messes up the game. Pump up all the heroes you can grab, plus a few more units, and go on a rampage that requires no skill at all.4) Price.However, if you ignore (if its possible) the stuff listed above and by others, Warcraft3 is an average game, and Blizzard might even get around to balancing things. Blizzard is a pretty much trustworthy game producer, and I have never had a problem with them."
2,Very dissappointed,"The presentation was good. I bought this Collection to get a behind scences on the making of Warcraft etc. I was dissapointed that the DVD wasn't more than the game. No running commentary, no behind scences. I will be selling it as soon as I can."
5,Awesome game,"I bought Warcraft 3 because I am a fan of the Warcraft series. I was blown away by the amazing graphics and the overall playability of the game. Once you have beaten the game in campaign mode you can go online and play via Battle.Net, or as many people do, via your home network.Warcraft 3 is different from WC2 and Starcraft because you are introduced to special characters (Heroes) who level up during the game and have special abilities. Heroes are a key feature of the game that makes it different (and better) than other games of this type.Another interesting thing in this game is that you have motivation to beat your opponents without use of overwhelming force. The more units you have the higher ""tax"" you pay on gold and wood that your units bring in. This makes you try to find more creative ways to beat your opponents.Overall this is an awesome game."
5,10 minute field trips,as a teacher for 33 years I still refer to the old school ways when teaching about nature and the enviorment. This book is the basic boot camp of outdoor education.
1,FORGET IT..,"Sorry, but I only like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chen. Who is gonna even try to look for some third class actor movies? Jet Li is the third star, but Bruce is the best, he is my brother and all..."
2,"OK, but step-on switch to lower handle broke right away","This vacuum is fine, but the switch that you step on to lower the handle from the upright position broke almost immediately. I had to jury-rig it, which is enough of a drag to make me wish I hadn't bought this, even though it was deeply discounted at the time."
2,Big and Clunky,"Okay, we know Eureka didn't just starting making vacuums. I've owned Eureka's for years. This one is by far the most clunky, Heavy, unbalanced, hard to use, did I mention HEAVY? I'm a 195 lb. man that goes to the gym, I can't imagine Grandma trying to clean with this thing. It cleans carpets well once you can man-handle the thing. The hose is a joke; it's way too short. Come on Eureka, you can do better than this!!"
2,Extremely heavy,"I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews about how heavy this thing is. At the time of purchase we had a one-story house but moved into a two-story house soon after and it is extemely heavy, especially when lugging it up the stairs and trying to vacuum the stairs. I am in my mid-20's and after hauling this thing upstairs my back starts to ache. I find myself not vacuuming the upstairs as often because it is such a pain. I am disappointed considering we spent $130 on this thing because I am in the process of buying another vacuum because this one is just too heavy."
1,Bad choice,"I ordered the Eureka 4870DT because Consumer Reports gave it a high rating and other Amazon customers were enthusiastic about it. The vacuum was annoyingly difficult to assemble; the two sections of very cheap plastic never fit together without a gap. When I tried the vacuum out, its electric cord became knotted, despite being plugged in. Amazon processed the return very quickly and reliably."
3,Its Ok,"I bought this item and had high expectations from all the glowing reviews. I am a bit disappointed. It is a decent machine. A bit heavy and difficult to maneuver. It does a nice job of cleaning. It cleans about as well as the cheaper, 5740A unit. More attachment suction than the 5740A though.I do find two problems that others have written about too:1) It squeaks when using it. very annoying2) The handle release button take a heck of an effortIts too bad they couldn't mash the 5740A and this one into a new unit though. I love the 5740A for its great cleaning and lighter weight. I hate it becase its bagless and the filter is a huge pain to clean and emptying the container is major dust storm. I like the 4870 because it has great attachment suction and no emptying containers and heavy cleaning of filters. The 4870 is just heavy, bulky, squeaky.Overall, its ok. Just not as amazed by it as everyone else. It was worth the cost, but it was not an excellent value - just average."
4,Fantastic Vacuum,"Wonderful machine, got a great deal however, I would have paid a bit more if I had to. Great suction, quiet and very easy to operate. It's not self-propelled, however it is very easy to push around for an upright. Would definitely recommend."
4,Eureka is a hit.,"Very satisfied with purchase, exceded expectations. Wtih adapters is very useful around the house in many diffferent capacities. Performs exceptionally well and would recommend this product to a friend."
3,Lasts about 5 years,"I have owned this item for 5 and a half years. The first things to go were the piece of plastic that holds the item up (now it falls down all the time), the piece of plastic that holds the hose on (now the hose swings freely) and the piece of plastic that connects the hose to the detachment brush (now it has less suction). I guess for the price it was a decent 5 years but they certainly don't make items like they used to. It's called ""planned obsolescence"" - the company makes an item that they know will break in 3-5 years so you come back and buy another one. A negative side effect of capitalism. Too bad, this one is destined for the landfill because the quality is just not there."
1,"Loud, heavy and lousy on hardwood floors","It is disappointing that in this day and age a vacuum must be so loud that I have to use headphones in order to comfortably use this.I would NOT recommend buying this as it is:1.Way too loud2. too heavy to carry up stairs without risking a fall.3. If you have any hardwood floors, forget about it picking up much of anything-even on the brush-down setting. While we tend to watch where the vacuum is going, it's busy spitting 80% of everything out the back! That really makes me crazy.Enough said--look for a different brand that will do the job, and do it without all the noise."
3,Cumbersome,"This would be a great vacuum if your house is covered in carpet and is rather large. It is not so great if you have a smaller space with lots of nooks and crannies to get into. This vacuum is rather heavy for cleaning around hardwood floors and underneath beds and such. I thought I could use it as an all-purpose vacuum. It does not work well for throw rugs either. It almost ate one of mine. The attachments are awkward because you have to pull the vacuum along with you, and it being upright and heavy, makes its ease of use not very easy. The wand isn't very long either. I couldn't even clean under my bed properly."
1,is this item refurbished?,"The Eureka 4870DT is the second household purchase I've made from Amazon this month covered with marks indicating previous use and delivered in a box that wasn't factory sealed. I might choose to buy a refurbished item for a discounted price, but I prefer to see it advertised that way. (I regret that I'm simply too lazy to pack this large item back in the box and ship it -- even though the brush roll control switch is broken, which would certainly be reason enough for a return.) Amazon wins this one, but I've learned my lesson and will make these kinds of purchases at a brick-n-mortar store in the future.The suction appears excellent for floors, but the suction from the attachment hose becomes negligible if you attach the extender."
3,Owned this for 3 years and looking for a new easier vacuum,"I have had this vacuum for 3 years. It is a work horse, but now it seems to be an aerobic workout to clean my house.It is VERY HEAVY and it now seems to drag and drag. I have had it serviced several times and the belt keeps melting. I am now looking into a DYSON, which seems to have 5 star ratings. The one good thing about this vacuum is the suction and the HEPA filter. I never sneezed using this and it was good for my allergic family. I am just tired of the weight and difficutly to use this."
3,Vacuum-barely sucks,"We have a house with ~3000 sq. ft. carpet, 800 sq. ft. hardwood floors. The vacuum does pretty good on carpet. However, it barely sucks anything off of wood floors. We have 2 kids under 5, so there are lots of tidbits on the floor. The light on the vacuum is great for illuminating the pieces that must be manually picked up/swept off the floor, beecause the vacuum won't get them up. Additionally, the hose for the wand (when properly stored away), escapes and gets caught under the wheels when vacuuming.I have a nearly new (used ~6-10 times) Eureka ""The Boss"" 4870DT for a good price if anyone wants it. I'm soon purchasing an Electrolux Oxygen canister.Overall though, for ~$150 and decent carpet vacuuming, the Eureka is OK. For hardwood floors, it is pathetic. I need both in one vacuum--thus the Electrolux."
2,Look elsewhere,"I bought this based on reviews and research. While there are some nice features, and it appears to have good sucking action, I am most peeved with the fact that I've had to replace the flimsy belt twice in the last month. No amount of sucking action matters if it sits in the corner while I run out to Lowes to get yet another belt.I never had this problem with my Hoover. If I were to do it all again, it's Hoover all the way. No more Eureka's for this cleaner. They say a sucker's born every minute and there'll be a Eureka 4870DT sitting idle next to him."
2,Good Suction but awkward and clunky,"I bought this vacuum because of the rating it got in Consumer Reports. After having a Panasonic for the past 20 years, I found this vacuum to be awkard and clunky. The handle is too short, the release lever takes the force of a sledge hammer to activate. It vacuums carpets nicely but is hard to handle. Using tools is an altogether different matter. Using tools is a nightmare. The hose is too short and it is not worth the effort. To be honest, I took this vacuum back to the store for all the reasons noted above. I don't know who is doing the ratings at Consumer Reports lately, but that orginization has lost credibility with me because of the vacuum ratings of late."
1,"Great when I first bought it, BUT...","When I first bought this vacuum, I was very pleased with its performance. It seemed very powerful. I've now had it for a year and a half. It keeps overheating, and stopping after just a short period of time. It doesn't have a full bag indicator, so you don't notice that the bag is full until the clear tube is clogged, and then it is very inconvenient and messy to take the vacuum apart and reassemble it. I wouldn't recommend this vacuum to anyone."
2,Don't always believe Consumers Report,"My husband did alot of research on vacuums and when CR rated this vacuum as the best we figured what the heck. A BIG WRONG. I have had nothing but trouble. Just replaced a belt and now the vacuum has a high pitched ring. This is it for me, never again."
5,Excellent vacuum for the money!,"This vacuum was rated a Consumer Reports Best Buy, though I was skeptical. This cleaner is awesome! Quiet, powerful, great storage of attachments. This is well worth the money spent. Better than my old one by a LONG shot."
5,Great Vacuum,"I bought this Vaccuum because of all the positive reviews on here, and [...]. The reviews are correct. This Vaccuum could suck the chrome off a trailer hitch. This vac has so much suction that one pass with it, made my carpets look allmost brand new.This thing is heavier than others I have used, but because it sucks so good, I can look past that. It is also nice to know that I bought this Vaccuum at half the price as some other retailers were charging. Highly reccommended........."
4,Nice Vacuum,"I am very happy with this vacuum cleaner. The most noticable difference I have found is it is quiet and it works. I also like that the bag snaps into place and is filled from the top. It does a good job cleaning the carpets and it has the floor setting. For the price it is the best buy I have made with vacuum cleaners. I do not know how often Amazon has the sale I bought it from, but it cost me $129.99."
2,Not for the long haul,"I was pretty happy with this item when I bought it in Nov 2004, despite the weight. The one thing I noticed over time is that the suction power using the hose diminished. I could see no obstructions etc. to explain this. The machine was just losing powerin recent months.The machine quit last week. I would say if you want a machine to last longer than 2 years pick something else. This one sucks."
3,Strong suction - hose is too short,"Yup, nice strong cleaning power. Wide track and the option to shut down the brush for bare floors is nice. But the hose is too short. Can't be extended more than 4-5 feet from the vacuum even with the extension wand. And it's attached at the bottom so you can't use it higher than 3 feet. I don't understand why such a short hose for a decent vacuum. Don't get this one if you plan to use the hose attachments regularly. If you have a lot of carpet it's a keeper."
3,Eureka Upright Vacuum,"This vacuum is powerful but being elderly it is very heavy and cumbersome for me. It is wide and does not fit in many spaces, it is heavy to pull back and it has a lot of weight on the handle that you need to hold up. The foot switch is very touchy and all these things add up to frustration."
4,"Really Powerfull, great price, didn't do too well on wood floor","I just got it and I am overall happy with it Really Powerfull, great price, but didn't do too well on wood floors or not as well as on carpets."
2,Vacuum is nice but belt breaks constantly,"I recently bought this vacuum after reading many good reviews. While the suction is great and the cleaning power appears to do a great job, the belt breaks every two to three times we use the vacuum and is hard to find in my local community. When I called the Eureka Customer Service line, they offered nothing but excuses stating it is part of the owner's maintenance and there was no warranty on the life of the belt. Very disappointing as I spend money ordering and paying for new belts and shipping just to use this vacuum. Someone should have warned me! Also hose tends to be cumbersome to work with and falls off it's holder easily. Again, knowing this may have prevented me from buying this vacuum."
2,Hard to find the parts,"When it works, it is ok. Sometimes I have to vacuum over the same place several times before it picks up. Some of the controls are a little hard to work, but with practice it's ok. The belt broke after 4 months of use and I've been to 3 stores and still can't find replacements for the belt or the bags. Some of the accessories drop out easily from the compartment slots. I researched a great deal before buying this, including Consumer Reports Magazine. A friend has a Dyson DC07 which is considerably more expensive but hugely better. I wish I would have went for the Dyson instead."
4,Cleans Very Well!,This vac really diggs deep into the carpet. The only problem was the toggle to release the handle to vacuum. You have to press very hard and it's made of plastic. I have a concern that it might break. I have been using it for a year and a half without problems. A good buy.
4,Great Suction-VERY WEAK BELT,"The belt broke the very first time I ran this vacuum(a pair of shorts got pulled into the brush area). I was able to find replacement bags and belts at Lowe's. Overall, I think this will be a very good vacuum, but, I will keep at least one spare belt on hand. It is a little heavy, but I've used heavier ones. I hope the company makes some changes on the belts because they are very flimsy."
1,systematic belt breaking problem,"this vacuum cleaner works well until its belt breaks, which is every few weeks. i thought there was just something wrong with mine, but try searching these reviews for the word ""belt"". You will see that many owners complain about frequently broken belts, and they're expensive, hard to find, and not very easy to replace either."
4,Good Vac but a bit heavy.,"I've had this vac for about year and a half now, and it 'sucks' pretty well. I like the floor/ tube switch, the HEPA filter is easy to clean, and is pretty quiet vac compaired to other vacuum's this size. Two things I've encounter with this vac are its um... undesirable weight for the stairs and such, and the stretch hose gets a little loose after awhile. This sometimes causes the hose to fall off the mount when using the floor vac option. All in all, for its price and reliability its a pretty good vac."
4,Good Vacuum,This is a good vacuum for the price. It is powerful and cleans well. The only downside is that the hose that connects to the attachments is fragile and prone to splitting.
1,This Vacuum Sucks big time!!,It took me a long time before i bought this vacuum at sears ..I read all these reviews and thought this will be THE ONE...Boy was i ever wrong! Don't get fooled into buying this vacuum ..Ill spare you the headache! It leaves behind crumbes and its suction is terrible..also get ready to get buffed arms..because this thing is HEAVY! Ouch my back aches!And as for cleaning the bare floor..yeah right! Once i switched to bare floor all what it had picked up from the carpet came out! And then all this dust is on the vacuum from the outside! Isnt it supposed to be in the vacuum? I think the people who wrote the comments on this vacuum are getting paid to write their reviews..Dont get sucked into peoples reviews..go with your instincts:)
5,"Lasted 3 years, great suction","Unfortunately the hose tore this morning after 3 years of frequent use. I'm sure it would have kept going longer but with two small boys pulling it around by the hose and a dog who occasionally liked to attack the hose with his teeth when it was turned on, it was bound to break at some point. The suction and motor were still going strong. Works great on both carpet and hardwood/tile. The hose especially has strong suction. I purchased replacement bags and filters easily and inexpensively on ebay throughout the years. Bag was good sized and didn't need to be changed too often, even with a shedding dog and cat and messes from the boys. I'm ordering another one today to replace this one. I read reviews for other vacuums and consumer reports and feel confident in buying this one again."
3,Noisy and Rattling,"I purchased this vacuum two months ago, primarily due to the overly positive write-ups to date.However, I am disappointed in the following:1) When in upright position and turned on, the brushes are suppose to stop rotating. My brushes not only do not stop, but they rattle like there is a lego or hot wheel jammed in the unit.2) The accessory parts do, as indicated in other reviews, fall off during vacuuming.3) When I pull the vacuum backwards during vacuuming motion, it makes rather weird gear-grinding noise.The vacuum does pick up lots of things and is far better than the 20-year old piece of junk I had previously. Anyhow, I am not sure if I have a lemon or what.....maybe this is what you expect for the money."
2,"Windy, heavy, piece of junk","I'm going to return this. I was disappointed because the Hepa filter on lower front created wind that blew dust bunnies in my face when I vacuumed my wood floors. It worked just great on an oriental rug. Itsucked the linoleum so hard I couldn't move it. When I adjusted the setting, it left hair on linoleum and tile. Not to mention it is so heavy! I'm petite, and this bulky, heavy thing left me feeling frustrated after carrying up stairs and over door thresholds. Also, you have to change the settings with each surface-just a turn of theknob, but it's an extra step...Don't buy this unless you have wall to wall carpet and you don't mind the weight."
4,Very Good Vacuum,I ordered the Eureka 4870DT mostly for oriental rugs. We have used it for over a month now and it is a very good vacuum. The suction is incredible and the brush very effective. We have a dog and it picks up dog hairs easily. I would recommend this machine as a best buy because it is so economical. The one complaint is that is is very heavy and may be hard for an older person to use.
4,Eureka 4870dt,"The vacuum is a little heavier than I thought it would be. The suction is tremendous, I can't believe the dirt that it has picked up and the vacuum that it is replacing is only 2 years old and was a canister and I thought it was doing a great job!"
4,Great vacuum if you've got some muscles,This is my 3rd Eureka vacuum and I've always had great luck with them; very durable with great cleaning ability. This 4870DT sucks like crazy. I prefer the bagged models because they are neat and easy to empty the dirt; bags are really cheap too. The power cord is extra long; almost too long. It can get tangled a bit. The attachments and assessories fit handily into the back of the vacuum and work very well for stairs and edges. It is also very quiet compared to my previous model. The only real negative is the weight; it is VERY heavy. My Grandmother wouldn't be able to manuver this. It's a pretty good workout if you're able-bodied. It's a great vacuum for the money; excellent value. I would buy it again.
4,Great Vacuum!,"I bought this vacuum after using bagless vacuums for the last 8 years. I have now been converted back to bagged vacuums. Here are what I consider the best features:There is little to no dust/debris coming out of this vacuum.It has great sucking power.It has a long cord.You are able to turn off the beater brush to do hardwood floors.The only problem that I have with this vacuum is that the release lever is hard for my wife to release. It is a big yellow plastic wedge.All in all, I love this vacuum."
2,"Good for carpet but, definitely useless on barefloor","We have both carpet and bare-floor in our house. Its not reasonable to buy two vacuums. The vacuum cleaner was supposed to be good for both type.Its decent on carpet (I think many vacuums are good, nothing special here). However, its really bad on bare-floor like wood, pergo, marble, tile etc. Anything heavier than a short strand of hair doesn't get sucked. I just lays there even if you vacuum it several times.Thinking of getting a really good vacuum for bare-floor. Anybody have any suggestions?"
3,Great Vaccum but VERY FRAGILE. Beware !,Suction is excellent!!However the belt broke after a few times. After that it started having a click click sound when in the upright position (turned on).A very fragile machine. Do not drop it hard or anything like that. Still works great but the clicking noise is annoying.I also took it apart and found the reason. Poor engineering. Oh well. It's a damn quiet vacuum when it's not clicking
4,works great but looks a little akward,"I bought this with $114.99 ($139.99 with $25 promotion) with free shipping, compared to about $150 at lowes. Price is great! Works fine too. We owned a high end Kenmore from Sears before, so this one can only win on price. My wife complaints that it's not as quiet, as slim, as powerful, etc. as her previous toy. I am OK with it. It's a little hard to put it to the workign position from the vertical position though."
3,"Good Vacuum: strong suction, sturdy construction, but a little difficult to use","Looks and feels sturdy, has very strong suction. It's a little heavy though, and some of the controls are difficult to use --for example, the foot switch which releases the handle from the upright position is so hard to depress that my wife stugggles to depress it!"
3,Gets the job done.,"Has great vacuuming power and gets the job done well. Vacuum time is reduced because the width covers more area than my old vacuum. I like the ergo handle, but because the unit is heavy I have a tendency to try to support the upright section with my other hand which is awkward due to the large diameter. I keep bumping the hose attachment into things, but it is great having the convenience of having it right at your fingertips. Unfortunately, I have to use it more often because of the width of the unit since it doesn't fit into all the areas my old one did. For power and attachment convenience I would give it a 4, but rated it lower overall due to the heaviness, awkwardness, and the cord gets in the way also. A retractable cord would be a big help."
3,"Very strong vacuum, extremely weak belt!!!","We bought this vacuum cleaner about 6 months ago. Even though it did an excellent job cleaning our carpets, we already had to replace the belt 3 times. The worst part about this is that the belt is extremely hard to find and we had to order it directly form Eureka (it's not cheap either... although they did give a free courtesy belt when we complained after the first one broke after only 3 uses)."
4,Great for Animal Lovers,"We have a large furry Akita and 2 cats, so springtime is shedding time. This vacuum takes it all in stride and keeps our house fur free (briefly). Moves easily, really deep cleans our carpets, and quickly changes to floor use. It's rated 'quiet' but the housing on the rollers rattles somewhat and one of the tools doesn't clip securely all the time. Other than that, a great vacuum."
1,H e a v y . . . v e r y H e a v y,"The eureka is cumbersome and difficult to maneuver. As others have noted, pushing it is not hard, but it resists pulling. And when you vacuum, you ""pull"" almost as much as you push. In addition, the switch for changing from hard surfaces to carpet is very difficult to change, the unit is fairly high so that it will not go under furniture, the headlight is useless and it is loud. As in ""LOUD."" Is there anything good to be said about it? Yes, in my brief test-drive, it did a very nice job cleaning.I really wanted to like this unit. ... Moreover, in the absence of any defects other than design flaws, I had a financial stake in keeping it rather than paying the return shipping ...No matter, I prefer biking to vacuuming for my work outs, so back in the box in went. I'll pay the freight. Not recommended."
3,THE BELT BROKE....,"...three times this year, and I've had this since March 2004. I've always used Eureka and never had a belt problem until this model. Maybe the one I have is a lemon. Eureka is sending me out another pack of belts free of charge, but if the belts keep breaking, I will have to buy a new vacuum cleaner. Not sure why it does that because I have been using this like all the other Eurekas I've owned in the past. I don't run over throw rugs either, so again, maybe mine is just put together badly or something. The suction is great, and the on-board attachments are convenient. It's just the belt factor..."
2,Not a good start,"I bought this on January 27. Within a month, the hose ripped. The service was prompt, I'll admit, and it was replaced within a week. But then 2 weeks later, that hose ripped. In a way, it's not the biggest deal, because the suction is strong enough that it doesn't even really matter if there's a small rip in the hose. It still does the job. But today, I plugged the thing in and the motor died. Annoying. And there aren't that many places authorized under the warranty that I can bring it. Annoying. Annoying. Annoying."
1,It's a lemon!,"I had high expectations after reading the Consumer Rpts review and specifically bought this model. This was the best price I found. However, the belt broke after less than a month, we used it maybe 4 times with nothing out of the ordinary home use. I went to 3 stores to replace the belt with no luck; turns out I have to go to a 9-5 specialty dealer to get a replacement . . . I've already GOT a job. I replaced the vacuum cleaner with another model that has readily available belts and bags that are easy to find. Such a disappointment!"
3,Monster Vac,"I purchased this after reading the ""Best Buy"" recommendation in a recent Consumer Reports issue. Very powerful but more than I needed. Good if your entire home has wall-to-wall carpeting, but if you have hardwood floors with area rugs it may attempt to inhale them -- too much power for small rugs. Also very HEAVY."
5,Absolutely a Winner! We love this!,"I can't believe this machine, well, I haven't used it yet, my husband has been doing the vacuuming and I can't get it away from him! Assembly was not a problem, and when he plugged it in, all he could say was WOW! The nap on our carpet, and we have high quality carpent, really ended up looking like it was just installed! While we thought we had a great vacuum before but wanted a newer model, we ended up with half a bag full after it's first expedition on our carpet! We are so pleased with this vacuum. It does what it is supposed to do beyond our expectations. No problem with staying with the bag models, we don't have to see the dust swirl around in a plastic tunnel. A big 10 stars for performance!!!! While this is not a lightweight machine for stairs, who cares, there are plenty of other inexpensive lightweight machines for that purpose. We highly recommend this model!"
1,Poor Product,"I did not like it from the moment I opened the box. Build quality is poor. Have to press very hard to tilt it down. After two weeks of moderate vacuming, the belt was broken. I was glad that it was still within the returning window, so it is with amazon now."
2,Vacuum was AWESOME but only for 18 months,I really love this vacuum but after 18 months we had to replace the motor and now 6 months later it needs another new motor. It is $90 to buy a new motor so we are just going to buy another vacuum. I am actually going to buy another Eureka the Boss and hope that my first purchase was a fluke. I am giving this vacuum 2 stars because I feel like it should last more then 18 months. I loved it so much I am willing to give it another shot.
2,Belts Break Often,I bought this vacuum because it had a good review on Consumer Reports. I don't like it. It is very noisy. It is very heavy to push around. The belt breaks about every other month. I owned an Orek for many years and was convinced by consumer reports that this was better. I am thinking of going back to Orek.
1,Disappointed in Eureka,"I just purchased this vacuum after doing a lot of research and reading all of the positive reviews. After assembling the vacuum I realized the switch to alternate between carpet and hard floors didn't work. The switch is supposed to stop/start the roller brush from spinning, but the switch wouldn't stay in the off (hard floor) position. Like other reviews stated, the pedal to recline the machine is super stiff and hard to push. I am returning the machine because of the defect and don't plan to purchase another one because I am disappointed with the overall look of the machine. It does not look very durable and I question whether or not it would hold up over the years."
3,VERY HEAVY...HARD TO PULL BACKWARDS,You will get a workout pulling this thing backwards. I have only used it once but my cleaning lady says it is heavy and difficult to maneauver backwards. She likes the on-board attachments though. Great price...still rated high by Consumer Reports.
3,Sizes run very large,"Using the info provided for ordering the correct size (my dog is a 10 lb toy manchester terrier), I placed an order for a small (1) collar. The collar was so large, my dog immediately came out of the collar. I exchanged collar for a X-small collar (0), this also was too large. I finally dismantled the collar and restitched to make smaller. Now my only problem is getting the dog used to the collar."
3,Darrell Lea Red Strawberry Soft Eating Liquorice,"It's ok, tastes a little sour and the strawberry flavor does not stand out compared to their black liquorice flavor."
5,Truely a Great Liquorice,I have been used to eating the U.S. long twist licorice twist strips of my youth and still enjoy those today.That is I did until ordering Darrell liquorice on a whim. This is GREAT LIQUORICE. It is soft but not too soft. I melts in your mouth but not too fast. It is wonderfully flavorful. Nice and chewy. A real joy to eat - nothing like it.
5,Delicious,"Tried it one time in a store because I like licorice. Softer than licorice and to me, it tasted like a fruit roll up or a gusher without the fruit juice inside. Has become my favorite candy. Plus I like the old fashioned type bag it comes in. By far my new favorite tasting candy"
1,Awful,I have purchased this item before and have had no problem. Received today. The Strawberry Liquorice is as hard as a rock. Its not the normal color red it's more of a light red and white. Not going to send a whole box of liquorice back. Should have waited for the product to be restocked in the local Target.
2,Too Sweet and chewy,I have tried a number of different brands before this; this is the sweetest of the strawberry version. It seems to be chewy and is not as soft as many of the others. It could be the batch. I prefer Lucky Country.
3,They're okay,"I've had these before, and I feel that the quality has diminished somewhat. Still so much better than Twizzlers."
5,Great if you need it,If you are looking at this item then you most likely need it. It makes the wire run very clean and is quality built. It works as advertised.
5,great product,"Great product, speedy delivery! This case is very sturdy and has plenty of space for 2 paddles and to store several balls."
3,Great product but could be better,"If i were a customer that have never used any other product by Boce i would have given this product a five star. However, i think its because i was having such a high expectation from this product that after i used it it didn't give me the result i was hoping for. I have tried the blue one before and it was like a miracle product, it left my hair super shiny and smooth (my hair was damaged to the point of no return...T_T) So when i tried this one, it didn't quite give me the same affect. But my hair was still getting progressively better so i think this product is still doing a great job, it just doesn't LOOK like it is...however i do think i will switch back to buying the blue one after i finish this bottle.Side note: Boce is silicone based product, so if you r a silicone free person, i wouldn't recommend this, but i just love BOCE so much i can't quit LOL"
5,Uppers & Downers,"These albums have been the best purchase I have made all year.The lyrics,melodies and production are fantastic.These artist really love what they do and it shows."
3,Maisy the Bus Driver,"If you are the parent of a young child, you probably know who Maisy is. She's a mouse with a duck, a squirrel, an elephant, and a crocodile for friends. Why the crocodile isn't trying to eat the others is beyond me, but that's life in Maisy's world.Both of my daughters love the Maisy books; there's something about their simple stories and colorful pictures that even appeals to adults. The books are short and easy to read. But, the stories are never obnoxiously simplistic, like so many other books for small children.Maisy's working today driving the bus. Who'll be waiting to board at each stop? And will Eddie the Elephant manage to fit on the bus?"
3,Our family loves Maisy,"My two year old is a Maisy (and a bus) fan, but we all enjoyed this book. Today Maisy is a bus driver and she visits bus stops numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 collecting her friends. Then they all get off at bus stop number 5. It's a good introduction to counting numbers without the confusion of also associating them with objects.There's not much to the story but it doesn't grate on me and it has a little more purpose than some of the other Maisy storylines. My son enjoys saying ""brrm brrm"" and ""bye bye"" at the appropriate places. And like all the Maisy books, the illustrations are bright and simple."
1,Maisy is uninspired,"This book is so boring it was a chore for me to read it, even though it is only about 100 words. The book is about Maisy picking up other animals on her bus route and then depositing them at the last stop. There is no rhythm or cadence to the text, and the illustrations are flat and dull. There is no moral, plot, or anything in it to make it an engaging read for a child of any age. There are better books out there."
1,"Worse than ""Squeeze""","""If you sprinkle when you tinkle, please be sweet and wipe the seat"", so said a framed cross-stitch that hung in Grandma's bathroom.Pity the Yule bros. couldn't have cleaned up after themselves similarly, instead of staining the VU legend with this piece of excrement. Why on earth anyone would want this is beyond me. Doug was nothing more than a Lou Reed impersonator by this point, whoring the VU name for bar gigs.Doug Yule was a member of the VU, to be sure, but he was a replacement member, not a founding member. His continued use of the VU name after Reed's departure was a disservice to the band's reputation. Please don't purchase this set thinking it's the same band that gave us such wonderful albums as ""The Velvet Underground and Nico"" or ""Loaded""."
5,"This book solved all of our ""scary"" issues.","I am really shocked. I have tried book after book to help my 4 year old daughter get over the fear of monsters in her room. I decided to give Maggie and the Monster a try. It looked cute and sounded helpful. This book is an unbelievable tool. I can't believe it. We have had the book a week and my daughter hasn't not cried or complained that their are monsters in her room since. She loves the story and says it is her favorite book. She carries it with her everywhere. What a delightful story that shows the child with a little encouragement from mom, she can solve her own problems and feel good about it in the end. Very empowering for children. I am so thankful for this story. I still can't get over the confidence it helped my daughter gain. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone but especially for children with nightime fears. My seven year old son even thought the story was funny and entertaining. He wants to borrow it to share with his class."
2,JUST OK,"I am an elementary science teacher and these dvd's are just talk, not much demonstration or example. They have won awards but the Schlesinger group of dvd's are much, much better."
2,Not the worst I've seen,"This video has middle school science concepts but is very animated and almost Barney-like in its annoying characters. But since I had few choices in this area of science I bought it. Thought it was a multi-volume set on each topic, but it's ONE video with a few minutes dedicated to each topic. If you find others pass this by........"
4,"I feel Jamacaican, Man.","This book really helps teach you a Jamaican dialect. You will not sound like the rest of north america in trying to pull off a weak dialect that you saw on ""cool runnings"". It really helped me. Get this book, even just to have. cheap too!!"
3,"Good, but not great.","Thomas Ott, Dead End (Fantagraphics, 2003)More of Ott's minimal horror-comics. Two stories in this one; in the first, a suitcase full of money travels through a number of greedy hands that meet bad ends. In the second, one midget hires a hit man to kill another midget. Hit man meets surprising, and bad, end.I like Thomas Ott's stuff, but there's too little of it in any given story. The whole silent-movie vibe is great, but when your characters look alike, things can get confusing. Much manga has the same problem. (And silent movies, at least, had cards when things got confusing.)There's a good deal here, but still a few pieces standing between good comics and great comics. ***"
4,Some very nice selections,"Because most knitting books and magazines only have one or two patterns that I might be interested in knitting, I rarely ever purchase them. I prefer to check books out of the public library or borrow from friends. However, this wonderful book has enough appealing selections that I find it an irresistable buy. Many of these patterns really are timeless classics, while others can be altered very simply to become classics. I have already used two of the patterns and have planned to knit half a dozen others in this book, and that's much more than I can say about any other knitting book I've seen so far."
5,Hard to Find!,Oil Rubbed Bronze snap in strainers seem to be hard to come by! This one worked perfectly on my drain and is a good match with my Delta Oil Rubbed Bronze and Venetian Bronze fixtures.
2,This album shouldn't exist,"There was one good song on this. I have no idea what the title of the track is because it's been so long. I heard it on the radio during a segment at the time called Midnight Metal Machine that aired every Wednesday from Mignight till 3 AM. After the song was over the host said that it was Cyclone Temple. I couldn't beleive it, I loved I Hate Therefore I Am so I rushed out the next day to get this. I was very disapointed because that was the only good song on the album. It would've been great if they just would've add this song on that album, or just released it as a single and not even come out with this crap CD."
5,Best Engineered Toy,"As a Toy Collector, I have enjoyed putting the ""Thomas Big Loader"" on my pool table each Christmas for friends to enjoy.Am glad to see it is still available.Many of us have committed that we would love to meet the person who designed this toy.It is a marvil."
1,STICK WITH WOODEN THOMAS SET!,Constant cries for help make this a parent's nightmare! The train cars will NOT stay together and toddlers get very frustrated. Plastic junk . . .
5,Lots of fun,I bought this Big Loader set for my son's 3rd birthday. He love's it! It's a great introduction for Thomas because it's battery operated. He can operate it with no problem!
3,More frustration than fun!,"I bought this set for my three year old son who is a Thomas fanatic. He does enjoy watching the cars as they go around the track. The bad thing is that watching is about all you can do with this toy! If he happens to touch it it totally throws off the flow of the engine that goes around picking up the cars. This makes my son very angry and I have to stop what I'm doing and go and fix it. Also the little black balls that are supposed to be the rocks or coal or whatever are constantly getting lost. I think we have maybe 4 out of 10 left. This would be a great toy for a child who is content to just watch, but I don't know any children like that! If I did I would pack up this toy and take it to them!!!"
3,a bit too tricky for younger thomas fans,"My 3 year old son is enthralled with Thomas, unfortunately, this installment in the Thomas toy line is quite over his head. I realize the box is labled for older children, but how many 8 year olds do you know who want Train toys?The biggest problem I have with it is the fact that the battery operated motor for the trains moves incredibly fast, and if the other pieces aren't EXACTLY right on the tracks, the whole thing falls apart and I have to put it back together. My little boy wants to have hands-on play with his trains. Unfortunately, the only hands-on with THIS toy is fixing it so it will run...Very confusing for both me and him... The only thing going for it is the price, but if I had to do it over again, I'd put my [money] on a more durable wooden set..."
3,Riveting,"My two year old son loves this toy. We set up a ""real"" model train set at Christmas, complete with village and he learned not to touch. When he saw this set at a model train expo, he was done for the day. My husband bought it and set it up for him. Little ones are going to try to touch while it is in motion, but with adult supervision, it keeps my son riveted and quiet for a good hour at a time. He snuck into the living room and took it apart. This is one that requires adult supervision with little ones. The balls get stuck and the train derails, but all in all it's a fun toy for all of us. Now he's hooked on Thomas!"
3,Unsatisfactory,"This was a gift for my 2 1/2 year old. It is difficult to assemble, and the child couldn't use it alone. Even if he were older, it would have been difficult to use. I have put it away for later, if at all."
3,"Very neat, but limited hands on","I purchased this set used, but in excellent condition. My son is almost 2 and loves this train set!! I have to agree with the reviews that complain about the ""no hands-on play"". It is difficult for my son to just watch the engines do their thing and not interact. He wants to be involved, but as I said, he still loves it and constantly wants my husband to set it up for him. I am sure he may get bored with it eventually (as he gets older). I think my husband enjoys it more! :) One reviewer stated that it is difficult to set up according to the instructions. My husband had no problem setting it up (and we didn't have the box to go by), but it does take a few tries to get it going smoothly and in the right directions to work.Overall it is a neat toy, but kids may lose interest quickly. It may be more exciting with the other set attached."
3,works pretty well but has its problems,"I bought this for my 3 year old and he really enjoyed it, but after a few months it didn't work right anymore. The train kept getting stuck when it went up the ramp to dump the little balls in the bin.Nothing I did helped. Finally I got rid of the set. Hopefully they are not all like that. The concept is great, but for a little child it is disappointing and frustrating when the train gets stuck over and over again. I think the set should be about 10 dollars cheaper than it is."
1,Not a toy,"I believe a toy is something you can play with, not something you are supposed to look at. The train plays by itself, your only role here is to be a spectator."
1,Definately not for 3 year old's...,"My son received this as a gift and given that the toy won't stay together well or run right without adult guidance, he found the toy difficult and frustrating. He was interested at first in watching it but when he tried to play along, it would then fall apart and become a problem. The little balls are so easy to lose and though he loves the ball part of the toy, it is not safe for me to put in the play room since his baby sister will certainly swallow one. I think that is a hazard unless you have only one child in your family who is responsible (or old enough) not to put the balls into their mouth. Ifyou have younger children who share the play room, this is not a good toy to have around.I plan to ask the relatives who bought it to return it to the store."
3,"Fun to WATCH, NOT to play with","My 2 yr. old got this for Christmas and he just loves to watch Thomas and Terrence and Percey ""work"" unfortunalty it is NOT something he can be actually playing with. This toy is entertaining, he enjoys watching it, but it is abandoned for the wooded set soon after."
1,The Worst Toy Ever,"My son received this as a birthday present and I should have returned it immediately. This requires an adult to set up the train set and then once it is going, the child can absolutely not touch anything. So, basically, this is a toy that your child can sit and stare at. Do your child's IQ and imagination a favor and just buy the standard Thomas trains."
2,save your money,I went through 2 of these before I quit and bought something different. It is poorly made. The trains come off the tracks and it doesn't work correctly. I was very disappointed with the quality and with having to explain two times to my son that it was broken.
3,"Great idea, not so great in function","A child under the age of 6 or 7 cannot play with this by his or herself. The plastic is rather cheap and not very sturdy when the product is built. The idea is wonderful, but I don't think this set or any of the other sets like this one are good for a smaller child. I refuse to purchase any other sets like this, and my child is the Thomas child!"
3,"This toy is fun for kids, annoying for parents","This toy is a favorite in our house, but only when I have time to sit down and watch him play it. Being only 3 1/2 he is not able to fix the trains himself when the come off-track. So mom has to come to the rescue. This toy is more or less to just watch, if you want a more interactive toy look elsewhere."
1,DON'T !,"looks graet, doest it?well - it took me 5 minutes to realize that this one is going back to the store. (lucky me - my kids where sleeping when i tries to assamble it).keep you money and run...."
1,Possibly the worst toy we ever bought,"We literally returned this to the store within a few hours, thank god we had been too frustrated with trying to keep this on track that we never got around to applying the stickers. No instructions to speak of. I figured out where you were suppose to put the engines and the theory that you the motored wheels would pick up different tops but with my 3 year old going nuts (practically in tears by the end) I never clued into the fact that you flipped some lever (?) on the bottom to keep it in the groove. I had a hard enough time just getting the engine turned on with Terrance on top (I think it should start with Terrance - who knows..."
1,Not very Good at all.,"My son received this toy as a gift for his birthday. We set it up with no problem, except that the tracks come loose very easily. Every time my son pushes it with his foot while sitting watching it or just touches something, it comes loose. Also, kids like to play with the trains not just watch one at a time go round. Neat how it works, but my son gets upset that he can't play with Percy, Thomas and the crane at the same time. It only has one battery powered base and it drives around and drops off percy then picks up thomas. In my opinion, it's not worth the money. I agree with what the other reviewed said about the wood set. The wood set now comes with a electric/battery powered engines. Much better and great for the imagination. Endless possibilities instead of one scenerio."
3,He played with it once & all the pieces are everywhere,"My mom bought this for my son. It never really ran right, wouldn't stay on the track, & the pellets go everywhere. He would get frustrated & so did I. We put it away the first day & no one ever asked for it again, thank goodness."
2,Not stimulating enough!!!,"Thomas and his friends, Percy and Terence, they load, fill, scoop, haul, and dump their cargo of ""rocks"" around this bustling construction site. The vehicles move backward or forward, it is automatic when your child chooses which area the engines will go to next. A chute that dumps the load of rocks into Percy's tender and Terence will load Thomas with rocks.It was fun to look at for the first 30 mins but then my 30 months old son gets tired of it. There is no hands on interaction except controlling the loader to go forward or backward. I don't think it is a good, stimulating toy for my son!!!"
1,This toy is horrible,"My 2-year-old received this for his second birthday. It's not a toy for kids to play with at all. An adult must set this up in exactly one way and everything must be done perfectly for the toy to work. All a child can do is watch the toy go. This toy requires and allows for no creativity at all. Sure, the one time we set it up it was kind of fun to watch go, but as soon as it gets off track or taken down, it requires adult help to reset. All my 2-year-old could do (and this goes for older kids too) is wreak havoc with the toy. My advise: buy one of the wooden Thomas set that a child could actually play with."
3,it takes the right type of kid to enjoy this toy...,"Okay, so when I played with it I loved it. My two year old wasn't as enthusiastic until I shut off the motor. Its got sort of a Rube Goldberg thing going for it. As everyone else has pointed out, there is NO interaction involved. In fact, it moves so fast that if you DO try to interact with it, you screw the whole thing up and it has to be reset.I would say its more appropriate as a science educational toy vs. a way for kids to develop manipulative play skills (like the wooden set). There's so much going on here that older kids who have a capacity to comprenend its complexity will be able to sit with their parents and discover how everything works and how it does what it does."
1,Biggest Disappointment,"My girls were really excited when they saw this gift. But the excitement stopped there. Every experience after the pretty picture on the box was a nightmare. It took forever to put together and the removable chasis made it very difficult for my 3 and 4 year to interact with it. The chasis never hooked on the other trains correctly and the colorful train was only a loose plastic cover that rode on the stand alone chasis. If you try to pick up the train, the chasis would drive itself and the kids became confused. Everytime the kids touched anything, they would need an adult help put it back together. My oldest said that she hated this toy. I now wonder if I should by anything else that has to do with Thomas the Train. Do not buy this toy!"
1,Worst Christmas Present Ever,"This was a gift for a 3 and a half year old and after spending quite a while trying to snap all the pieces together we would move it just a little and they would come apart. The way the pieces go together is really poor. The rocks that it come with are also not made for a 3 year old and I couldn't believe were even included and, of course, are the one thing I can't take away from him now that he's spotted. The one thing he likes most which is Thomas doesn't seem to stay on top of the one motorized car. The whole concept makes no sense. It seems like for all the work it was to put together and the money it cost to buy it it nothing more than a waste. No matter how delicate we are when we move it from one part of the floor to the other, it still falls apart."
3,"Great itea, not good for little kids though","I honestly do not know what age group this toy is meant for, but it has a ton of peices, is a bit of a pain to put together and is entertaining for a four year old boys for about 5 minutes. My son got this for Christmas last year. My son, who was 4 1/2 at the time, watched the toy operate for about 5 minutes, then wanted to take it apart and did not know how to put it back together. Peices were lost and I was a nervous wreck because of the small balls that come with the loader. If your child has a short attention spand and tends to put things in his mouth, I would not recommend this toy."
3,"cool to watch, once it gets going","I bought this for my 2 year old son (for anyone under three take away the ""rocks"", as they are a choking hazard. They are so tiny they get lost in 10 minutes anyway.) Although we both have fun watching it, that's all you can do. I get frustrated because half the time it needs to be repositioned to run properly, and my son gets frustrated because there's not much to do with the trains off the track. It's a cute toy, but (coming from a mom & a preschool teacher) the $ can be better spent on a more interactive toy."
5,Loads of fun!,The Thomas Big Loader has been a huge hit with our son. He got it two years ago for his third birthday and still plays with it quite often. The whole family enjoys watching the trains do their work.
3,Save your money & Invest in a bigger Thomas set,"This is a cute ""train"" set, but directions are worthless - you can figure out the setup though by looking at the pictures. Also, was disappointed when after only 3 days of playing with it the motorized part quit working. It cost [money] to replace that part alone, but without it the set is useless. You can almost buy a whole 'nother set for not much more! The track has to be set up a certain way & there's no flexability in changing the track around. My advice ... save your money & buy a bigger and better track that can be set up in different ways, plus uses the actual Thomas train cars. This one is unique, but just too many parts that can break."
3,Loads of fun if all you want to do is watch!,"We got this toy for my son who turned 4. He and his 3yr. old twin brothers loved watching this toy go around the track, however they kept wanting to grab it and interact with it, which just messed everything up and we had to put it back together again and again! It is too irrisistable for them not want to touch it! Also there are about 6 little black balls that kept getting lost because of all the grabing. If you do not have all or most of the balls, then the whole point of this toy is lost! Eventually a piece was lost that was critical to the operation of the toy and now it just sits in a sack up in the toy closet."
5,Nostalgia,"My Dad had the original Big Loader, and I remember loving it. Much to my delight, even though this toy has a modern (Thomas) theme, it still has all the same functionality of the original. My boys are 4 and 2, and both get a kick out of watching the train, and operating the buttons to make it go back and forth. Surprisingly, we've only lost 1 of the balls, and they have learned not to touch the train itself. This truly is miraculous for orally fixated young boys. My wife was skeptical about how much they'd get out of this toy, but I've found out Dad's secret: only take out the toy a few times a week, and it retains its appeal ad infinitum. Chalk this one up for Dad!"
1,frustrating,after having it less than a week it kept coming apart. it's now in a garage sale box after frustrating my son & us.
3,"tricky, but fun overall","My 3 year old loves this toy since he loves anything related to Thomas the train. However, the tracks have a tendency to come apart with rather slight pressure, especially if my son leaned, sat or kneeled on the tracks as he played with the toy. When this would happen, my son would become slightly frustrated since the tracks were quite difficult to snap together properly. Overall, the toy is very entertaining and kids love watching the trains move the coal around the track."
4,changing battery,"The instructions are no longer with the set. Trying to figure out how to put in the new battery was a real challenge. There is no indication on that part of the toy for one to know how to get into the battery compartment. All I could figure to do was to take out all three screws. When it was opened all little parts fell out and it was quickly determined that the battery did not belong here. Instead, to access the battery compartment one must squeeze the sides of the bottom part of the unit to remove it and yeh! this is where the battery belongs. Now, tell me where the other little parts belong so I can get it back together and screw the top together. Should we rate this toy for parents?"
3,For the train loving child,"My three year old son loves watching the trains and ""scoop truck"" go around the track and do their various tasks. It is very facinating to watch, however, not alot of interactive play. The instructions are poor - at best - and requires a patient adult to learn how it goes together. If the engine comes off the track, it requires the same adult to get it back on task. Plan to spend the time with your child while s/he is playing with this. The little balls will definately get lost and they end up in parts of the track they shouldn't be in. The slightest bump makes the engine come off the track which means you have to constantly keep curious hands off the track. We were prepared for this because we had a similar item a few years ago so it was no surprise to us. As long as you are ready for what this toy requires, then you and your child will have fun watching it. The Thomas characters are adorable and very exciting to a ""fan""."
1,Truly a Letdown,"My 3-1/2 year old son received this ""toy"" as a gift. It is too large to leave set up, yet takes far too long to put together with any sort of frequency. There is virtually no opportunity for hands-on play, so my son just sat with a dazed look on his face as the trains continued on a circuit by itself. The only time any interaction occured was when the train skipped the track or became stuck, and it's un-userfriendly enough that he usually couldn't fix the problems on his own. I will be returning this toy this afternoon."
4,great fun for parents to play WITH children,"My two year old son got this for Christmas and it is his absolute favorite toy of the season. This is not a toy that your child plays alone at this age. This is a toy for you to do WITH your child. My child goes to bed and wakes up asking about it. He is learning cause and effect as well as having lots of fun. I'll admit it was tedious the first time I put it together, but after that it's a snap to put up and take down. My only concern is that the coal is small enough to be a choking hazard if not properly supervised."
2,Disappointment,"My son loves Thomas the Train and we have a number of pieces from the Take-Along set. A friend gave this set to him for Christmas and it is awful. The track is very difficult to put together and the directions are very poor. My son has been so frustrated by this toy that I am tempted to put it away. If you are going to buy Thomas the Train products, I recommend the wooden trains or the Take Along trains -- they are made with a higher quality and are easier for children to enjoy."
2,Poor Quality and Customer Support,"This item does not stay together well. As you are putting one piece together, another comes apart. We had a problem with this item. There isn't a toll free number for the company on the box. They may have been something on the original instructions, but they are long gone. Their web site is not helpful at all for locating ""Customer Service"" Your better off buying Tomas and the wooden railway system. It is easy for the child to put together and also is a ""Hands On Toy"" plus has the child create their own stories with the trains."
2,no fun to just watch,"I bought this for my 4yr old grandson. He was bored with it in 5 min. All you can do is watch. The trains all work off the same motoried base, so they cannot be played with off the track. It is clearly one of the worst Thomas toys."
2,It Worked on Paper....,"My 3-year old son received this toy for his birthday. Although he does enjoy watching the action, it ends up being very frustrating! The trains rarely make more than two circuits before jumping the track or one of the train bodies fall off. Since the engine is battery powered and still running, it is difficult to replace on the track.The Big Loader Set does provide interesting watching but little hands-on interaction for the child. A small bump will cause either the train body to dislodge or the train engine to jump the track."
1,Very Disappointed,"My son received the Thomas Big Loader set for his 2nd birthday. After opening the package only one engine receives a motor, you must by two additional ones to make the set function as it should. The track will not stay together and the quality of the product is very disappointing. My son hates this toy, it frustrates him because he cannot use all 3 engines out of the box like you should be able to. Then he spends most of his time needing the track put back together. I am very disappointed in this toy and will not buy anymore Tomy products with Thomas until I begin to read all positive reviews on their products. My son should be loving his new toy, not be frustrated by it!"
1,Simply Terrible,"Mr. Newman plays with the accuracy and passion of a machine. This recording is truly lifeless. At the very least, he plays way too fast as so the listeners ears are only assaulted briefly."
5,Great for the price!,My daughter used them lots. They are very comfortable and affordable. A good choice for everyday tasks and school. It's highly recommended for kids and teens.
3,Not what I needed,Good cutting blade for stone or brick! Not good for finish tile work!excessive chipping cutting floor tile!Would not recomend this for finish work!
4,genimi 7,The product I purchased is in excellent condition for a second hand book and is a great bargin for my books on astronomy. A little let down as it's an ex library book with all the bar codes still on but that does not detract from the contents.
3,You get what you pay for,Synthetic leather. I'm not even sure what that means but it feels nice. After one game it started to show signs of wear though. It sets and spikes nice enough but everyone complained about bumping it. One of the kids that plays with us wouldn't serve after a while. We are a casual group that plays in a church gym once a week but even casual players deserve better than this. It just cost me $10 to be cheap.
1,Not worth buying,"This information can be found in any biz start-up book or on the internet. This book has 232 pages, 95 of which were wasted on ""Gift Show Surveys"". They're form pages filled in on different wholesale shows around the country. The information, show dates, est. attendees and fees are outdated as the book is three years old. I got more accurate information from going to wholesale shows, calling for exibitor packets and talking to people in the industry (this also created a networking circle for me). The author also writes in such a serious, superior form, you feel like she wanted just to write, ""Don't waste your time getting into this industry, you'll never make it"". It seems to me she was detailing what an ideal client should be for reps. She even had one of her business cards tucked in for her rep search site, kind of cheesy."
1,Worthless,"This product is worthless for crushing large, hard tablets and caplets. You can't get a good enough grip on it. Apparently it was designed for crushing medium to small sized, softer pills."
3,Sophmore effort still excellent,"Urban Cookie Collective's second major release, `Tales From the Magic Fountain' is a change in style, not enthusiasm or excellence. While `High on a Happy Vibe' was more club/dance music, `Tales' has more of a house feel. Again, Diane Charlemagne's soulful voice rings through. Of note are the almost ballad like ""So Beautiful"" and the uplifting ""The Rest of my Love."" Overall, if you are a lover of the mid 90's club house scene, you will enjoy this lighter side of the genre."
5,disagree with the previous reviewer,"This is an excellent review book in a Question - Answer format. The fact that most books are very close in content if written by the same author(s) is usually the case so let's not waste our time. In terms of reviewing material for Step-exams it has everything you need and more. I would say that a few days is not enough to go thoroughly through all of it, so allow yourself a bit more time and Good Luck!"
1,USMLE Step 2 & Step 3 Review (Pearls of Wisdom),"How come 2 different books and they are the same in the content......really it is bad book , i ordered this book and Family Practice Board Review (Pearls of Wisdom) and the 2 books are the same , i really wasted my money on this book and the family practice booard review from pearls.Do not buy this book ."
3,"Cute, but something's missing","Ok, so it sounded like a great plot for a movie--you know, lonely girl meets a great guy who ""takes her away"" from her life--that is, until he gets sick and, well, you know. Mary Louise-Parker is as charming as ever and can always deliver a line for a laugh. Peter Gallagher is also true to form--he is cute and romantic. Still, something is missing... For you guys out there I would definately call it a chich flick, one for the girls to watch with a bag of popcorn and a few tissues. All in all, not bad but then again certainly not oscar worthy."
4,A Tear-Jerker,This is a good movie that teaches about family relationships and how to forgive. It touches really close to home and is a movie that you need to watch with a box of tissues. This is a great movie to share with a large group of family.
2,I thought the acting was terrible...,What on earth the Peter Gallagher character sees in the Cate character I just couldn't fathom. She owns a vintage clothing store and looks petrified when any potential customer comes in not even greeting them. This is too unbelievable. She hates her father and that is evident at the father's birthday party when he cuts her down - Cate should have walked out then and it would have been the end of story. Not a good movie as the acting is too overdone - even the gestures don't fit the script. I was expecting so much more. Just a disappointment for a Hallmark.
4,A true Hallmark Hall of Fame movie,"This is a typical Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie. I enjoyed the story for its twists and turns and the real life lessons it offers. Mary-Louise Parker and Peter Gallagher are both great and have real chemistry with each other. Coming from a family of seven girls I could relate to the family dynamics and a daughters need for a fathers approval. If you like Hallmark movies, this is a must-see."
1,Do Not Buy This Recorder!,"I am a professional musician- and this recorder has provided the absolute worst recording sound I have ever heard! I get better quality with the little small cassette tapes in a cheap handheld.The sound is fuzzy and garbled, even with the external microphone I bought, and even talking is hard to hear. Don't waste your money on this."
4,Olympus DS 2300 -- used for medical transcription.,"We have found this digital recorder to be excellent for dictation. The voice quality is excellent, very clear and crisp. The way the play/reverse button is situated contributes to accidentally erasing dictated material. This seems to be more a problem for men, with larger hands; however, it can be overcome with awareness of and attention to the problem. If the button were reversed, it could potentially aleviate the problem. All-in-all we are very happy with this recorder."
3,Waiting for better product,"Unfortunately, the problem with digital recorders is the fact that the options are very limited. This recorder does what it is supposed to do but not in a superb way. Be very careful with the battery lid which will fall off and is very flimsy. I tape it every time I change the batteries (which is very frequent)."
3,functional but durability remains in question,"This DS 2300 recorder has all the functionality needed for frequent voice file creation. Importantly one can rewind and record over the file without creating a new file, a feature not available with some other models.My concern is what happens with the flimsy power and hold switches that need to be slid back and forth before or after use. My last Olympus recorder, a different model, continued to work fine but the hold switch broke. Frequent replacement of batteries was required to continue to use it. The future destiny of this DS2300 is likely, I fear to be the same; perhaps this guarantees the need for a replacement in a year or two."
2,(Two-and-a-half out of four) Another Artsy Webb Wilder timekiller until his next LP came out,"As much as I like Webb's various 'Hillbilly'Detective genre type stuff, this was justtoo artsy-fartsy for me to get all the waythrough. Webb is pretty good (and sometimesprofane) in these type things, so I recom-mend the funny and bold Webb Wilder's CornFlicks to this by a good bit. There are noother 'known people' in here which makesthis West Texas murder mystery-detectiveflick that much more difficult to take. Itis well filmed and edited though."
2,Mixed Feelings,"After paying a lot of money for this, I found it unremarkable, considering the names involved. And, to me, it represents something wrong -- too many people using a national icon's celebrations for personal profit. I wish this book had been done by people truly celebrating West Point by volunteering their time and talents. It probably would have been better. Because of that, along with its being a little too big, boring, glitzy, and [costly], I came away with mixed feelings about it."
2,so-so,"Really didn't grab me. Maybe its just me, but, considering all the hype, the essays never captivated me. I was disappointed. And, it is expensive. I have to say, I would not recommend this book."
2,Disappointed,"In my opinion, this was little more than a glorified admissions department catalogue. A big public relations brochure for West Point, only you have to pay for it. Not what I expected. Sorry, I do not recommend it. I was disappointed."
5,GET THIS BOOK,"As a graduate, I found this book compelling and entertaining. It should be issued to all cadets upon graduation. I have so many people ask me about my experiences at West Point and its history. I now have a tool to help in my explanantion. How did all these writers come together? Do we have to wait another 200 years for the next issue? I hope not."
5,Powerful tribute to an American Institution,"During this time of great national pride, this book is a beautiful and eloquent tribute to the institution that shapes and molds the young men and women who have defended, protected and lead our country. From the point of view of some of America's great writers, some expected like Stephen Ambrose and some unexpected, Arthur Miller, it is an engaging read. The illustrations and photographs are gorgeous and the overall tone inspires a sense of nationalism and respect for one of America's most influential institutions. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to enhance their library with a piece of American history."
4,The Apartment Gardener,"A well written easy to read source of inspiration for all those people who have wanted to garden, but lack a yard to do it in. Unlike standard container gardening books, it is tailored directly to growing conditions in apartments, where light, space and humidity are important considerations. After one hour with this gem, I ran out to buy potting medium and soil and began my happy gardening experience, in the heart of a busy city. I have found it a valuable reference, suitable for the novice or advanced apartment gardener."
3,What could have been..,"In the product description for this watch it says there is ""floating 5, 6 and 7 on the patterned lower dial"". This is almost true except for the floating part. Instead the numbers just fall freely which causes them to often get jammed together. What could have been an excellent idea of having the numbers float in some sort of translucent liquid, making the design moreso unique, the watch instead has lifeless numbers that appear clumsy. The other quirk I had with this watch is that it's unisex but the face is huge, too big to fit onto a girls wrist.I still love it though."
3,Bushings for ford,These bushings are a little bigger than the original.other than that after turning them down in a lathe there perfect.
3,life dafter deathrow,it is a pretty horrible dvd for any one who is not the crooked i fan which iam so i enjoyed it a little bit just being able to see one of my favorite artist but overall it is junk it has special features that dont play so you pretty much get cheated i would recommend watching it at a friends house or some one who owns it it will not be worth your money if you are not a fan iam and it was not worth mine
2,promises unfulfilled,"when you take a singer like robin s and give her a lightweight song with a catchy beat, she is wildfire. this is definitely true of her 'show me love', a song that i am not too fond of, so say the least.but when you give her good soul tunes to cover, she should take off like a rocket. and sadly, she doesn't. i have tried many times to get past the first track of this disc, which is a solid cover of 'must be love', and can't. but her fervor and intensity are waiting for the right producer--say maybe timbaland--to put her right where she needs to be.at least, a duet with angie stone. please, pretty please!?"
3,This book was amusing and very engaging!,"I really liked this book, however it took me a while to adjust to the English way of talking. The female character is from London and the male from old traditions of royal titles. So the two main characters always had a lot to say, but always kept their feelings at bay. The time period was interesting and very fact based. It made you think what might happen and I couldn't seem to figure out the storyline which kept me on my toes. I was glad when all is well in the end."
3,Great Book at a Ridiculous Price!,"This is a very fun Latin program for children. It is very colorful, interesting, and user friendly. The author has a gift for teaching this subject to young children. If this Teacher's Resource book were priced reasonably ... I would rave about it to everyone I know and I would highly recommend it to all of my homeschooling friends. It is a great introduction to Latin for young children. It is, however, not worth the listed price, even if it came with the student book (which is an additional cost). It is a shame that this program is so overpriced."
3,Disappointing for what you get for your money,"While the teacher's book contains some valuable ideas for expanding on the lessons, the cost of it makes it difficult to justify buying it. If you know no Latin at all and want to use the Minimus books, I would recommend getting it; otherwise the price is really out of line with how much information you actually get. It's too bad, as the student books are wonderful."
4,Minimus Teacher's Resource Book: Starting out in Latin (Cambridge Latin Texts),"This book is filled with additional words, activities, and a glossary that will surely help first-time Latin homeschool teaching moms like myself. However, I do wish the chapter resources/reprintables were geared a little more toward academic activities. The biggest drawback to the teacher edition is that it doesn't print the Latin version of the chapter stories found in the student book. The English translations are great, but for those of us who are new to Latin, having both versions side by side, would be helpful. This being said, I do not regret purchasing it...I would be lost without it!"
3,GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS,"THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS VERY GOOD, BUT HAD TO TOSS OUT 3 JARS BECAUSE OF BROKEN SEALS."
5,I love this album!,"I fell in love with the song ""Lucas with the Lid Off"" back in the day, and the full album really exceeded my expectations. Awesome beats and lyrics, in a jazzy NY hip-hip style. I wish more people could hear his music so he could get the credit he deserves. But at least he is still making music. Look him up on Wikipedia (under his full name, Lucas Secon) and you'll see the long list of songs and albums he has contributed to."
5,With The Lid Off!!!,'Lucas With The Lid Off' is one of the more awesome songs i have ever heard. i am definitely diggin' it. the only word to describe this song is groovy. it has that right combination of jazz and alternative that just makes you want to move. i really wanna move.
5,Simple and Unique,"I had so many books on creativity, all dealing with all theory and excercises as if we will all become creative through doing maths or geometry, but this one book is unique in the sense that it takes creativity to a whole new level. The whole idea of the book is to make you concious of who we are as human beings and how can we take all those little moments and insights that we look all day from dawn to dusk. I would recommend this book to anyone who think that creativity is not their cup of tea."
1,This is the worst book I've ever read,"It was written by a non-native speaker and apparently never edited or copyedited. It is incoherent, incomprehensible, poorly written, nonsensical and contains absolutely no useful ideas. I am returning my copy. Do not waste your money. It's absolutely appalling that Amazon.com and IUniverse are selling this title. It is essentially a crazy person's ramblings and should be pulled from the shelves. Appalling!!!"
5,loved it,"This movie is hilarious! Burying their mom in a sleeping bag while drinking a beer, the mean sheriff, the bank jobs.. The younger brother just cracked me up!"
3,COHEN STYLE COMEDY,"I was disappointed in the small role of Jennifer Tilly, who would have made a better lead. The dialogue was good. It was funny for what wasn't said, then what was. A man says of his daughter, ""She is still technically a virgin."" Okay, what does that really mean and why would her father know? Two grown brothers can't handle the day to day aspects of life without a mother. After attempting several times to hire a prostitute for maid service, they opt instead to kidnap a woman. Her life is so miserable, living with the unlikeable Patrick Warburton, that she decides to stay with them. Does everyone in Texas wear Buddy Holly glasses? In the typical twist, the audience roots for the law breakers. The movie reminded me very much of ""Raising Arizona,"" but not nearly as good."
3,A Neti a day....,"What can I say? A neti a day, keeps the doctor away!Excellent for irrigating the nasal passageways. I found this pot a little large for my small frame, but excellent quality.Tracey L. Ulshafer, author ""Butterfly"""
4,R&B Album of the Year. Smooth blend of groove & hip-hop,Unfortunately it was a bad year for music. That's why it only gets an 8 but no other albums would get a higher rating from me (this year).'Time after time' a remake of an 80's tune by ? is just fabulous. At first I thought 'you gotta be kidding me'. But after hearing it a few times I was hooked. Delivered with so much feeling and power it's incredible. Infectious beats and oh so smooth.Now there are a few sub-par cuts but overall a real gem. if you're anything like me you'll find yourself listening to it over and over again.
5,This is my favorite CD!,"Changing Faces All Day All Night is my personal favorite CD to date. I long for the days when this was R&B.When it was still about singing and song, not gimics and rappers. Ghettout one and two are gems on the album and just have the whole R. Kelly vibe which Changing Faces are perfect for. Time After Time has been remade hundreds and hundreds of times in all genres of music but This is by FAR the best remake of the song ever done..Cassandra takes it there. I am so infatuated with Cassandra Lucas.Other hot tracks..Thinkin bout you, All Day All Night(this song ladies and gentelmen is what r&b should be)..This album also Has my alltime favorite slow jam, you can be my baby tonight..Standing Ovation..all day all night every day every night, a classic is forever even listening today in 2005."
3,Not as tight as their first album,"First off, it is painfully obvious that R. Kelly produced several songs on here because they all sound like his past hits. ""G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T."", their biggest hit, has production that sounds a lot like the ""Down Low"" remix; ""All of My Days"" (featuring Kelly and a dope verse from Jay-Z) sounds like ""Humpin' and Bouncin'""; the title track sounds like the original version of ""Down Low"" and ""G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T. Part II"" sounds like the ""I Can't Sleep Baby"" remix (Kelly even sings the ""naa-naa-naa-naa"" line on here). When Changing Faces aren't busy duplicating R.'s success, it's not much better. On ""I Apologize"", they say such clichéd lyrics as ""I'm down on my knees/Begging you please"". Their first album is much better and I didn't pick up their third album, Visit Me, because of my disappointment for this album."
2,Millionaires? The hype cheapens the message.,"I have to take issue with the repeated references to millionaires, riches, making millions, secrets, etc. I think the book does present some good strategies and ideas for making money online, but all the ""millionaire"" hype is a bunch of nonsense. Most of the people he profiles in the book are not millionaires. Having an internet company with a million dollars in annual sales does not make you a millionaire either. I didn't expect to find any million dollar ideas in the book anyway, but come on: the only reason the word millionaire appears in the title and on just about every page is to add hype to what are very simple and basic strategies that you can find in a number of internet business books. Having read several of these books, I found little information in here that was either new or novel. I'm sending mine back."
2,No Substance,"I did read the whole book and it did have some good tips here and there, but most of the topics were more to 'inspire' you than to teach you something. I am surprised at all the good reviews of this book (at-least so many 5 star ratings). I was hoping this book would have had useful tips for Search Engine Optimization; the entire book just seemed to lack something."
5,very informative,"The entrepreneur profiles were very helpful with allowing me to focus on my ideas and interests. The stories were also very encouraging. I learned that my dreams are alive. Your book is a total eye-opener. I've always wanted to start my own business besides being an engineer, but I used to think that it ONLY involved me having to spend a ton of money to have a ""physical"" business.All through undergrad and grad school, I've come up with different ideas and I wasn't totally sure how to get anything started. After reading this book...it really helped me to focus and generate even more great ideas. You've opened up a whole new world for me. I recommend this book to those who are trying to find their focus or those who are seeking more guidance and understanding.Anthony...Maryland"
5,Great Book!,"I am still reading this and half way through and am so excited this was exactly what I was looking for, very thorough and helpful to get started! I love this book!"
1,Do no give your money to this Author,"If you already know what a ""blog"" is and you're fully proficient in searching the internet with google or yahoo, you're probably too sophisticated for this book. Fox's target are people with very little education (He introduces us at one point to the fancy MBA word, ""business plan""). Fox also uses the website he started for his wife and mother as case studies. I guess I should have known better. After all, it is called 'Internet Riches"" and has a picture of some guy driving in a brand new convertible on the cover."
4,"If you want to start an online business, buy it, read it and GROW","I learned that It is easier,faster and cheaper to take an idea to market via theweb than it is in the brick and mortar world.The book was well structured and easy to read. It actually deserves about ****1/2stars and not **** as I had indicated earlier. It was the best e-business book Ihave read that actually makes you less confused as you go along. It truly is aGOOD book and I would recommend it. Congrats to you Mr.Fox."
1,I did not find it useful,"In my opinion, this is pretty worthless. Particularly annoying was going to one of the websites recommended by the author only to find the authors mug there along with annoying popups."
5,"The very rare, real deal.","This book is a sensation. I simply cannot think of any part of it that I could suggest improvements in. I'm positive this book will be the resource that will cause thousands of new business ventures to be born.If a person is convinced that he/she should get into some business on the internet, and after a good study of this book, does not take the simple steps to build such business, then that person will have to admit to having no possible excuse for not doing so.George Pendergast Sr.Santa Barbara, Ca"
4,Planning to have your own e-business? Buy this book!,"Great starter! These days everybody thinks they know everything about internet and the world wide web. This book proves you wrong. With many interesting stories and tips, you will certainly learn something new which you will be able to use in your next internet business venture. All in all, good book if you're planning to have your own e-business. It will give you some interesting ideas on how to start from scratch. Recommend!"
1,Basic book.,This is a very basic book. It takes a lot of short cuts and it is truly simple and not secret. The sales pitch is long but the book is very short on quality information. Save your money find a better book.
5,At last I have found what I needed,At last I found what I needed to learn. Clear structure of all the actions you have to undertake to get started and build your own e-business.
2,Lots of blah blah blah,"There is useful information but nothing I have never heard about before. Each chapter is a review of an existing online business with info on how and why they succeeded. I did not like the author bragging about his experience and the fact that he helped his mother and his brother with their online businesses and this is why they were successful... It's all about me, me, me!!!"
1,OMG...was that bad!,"Great title, horrible content. The usefulness of this book hit its height in 2005--come on, one of its primary sources of information is eBay! I read through this book in sections as I moved on to other chapters trying to find use in another chapter after the first was set aside for lack (extreme lack) of new information, and so forth and so on. What's more, it's a waste of time for me to return this book because it was so inexpensive--proving you get what you pay for--and it costs for shipping it back. Save yourself the ten bucks and get it from the library, or just burn your money, you'd get a bigger kick from that, and since you'd be beginning your habit of throwing your money away anyhow..."
5,Just what I needed,"Practical advises and ways to make it on the cyber commerce.Dr. Israel King, Ph D, Author ofHow To Keep A Man"
3,One Big 'To Do' List!,"You probably will have already thought of all of the tasks you need to do to start your own internet company prior to buying this book. This book gathers all of those tasks and puts them into one central location. If you work well from lists, get this book. However, if you simply lack the motivation to do what you know needs to be done, buy a book on motivation."
4,Must read if you want to be in this business,"I bought the book based on other good reviews. I will be honest and say that I thought the title and the cover reflected some kind of gimmick, get rich quick scheme. Overall I felt I got value out of the book, which is important. It is not a book for who is already in business, but it outlines principles and starter ideas. My expectations were low for this book, but I took more than a few pointers and will consult it in the future again."
4,This book is a great place to start,"I am the president and CEO of a small, internet business. I read many books on marketing, PR, and sales to constantly increase my knowledge of the marketplace. I recently read Scott C. Fox's Internet Riches: The Simple Money-making Secrets of Online Millionaires. I quite enjoyed it.Scott teaches the nuts and bolts of putting together an internet business in a price-conscious manner that can be run out of your garage. He cites many examples of successful internet business that are run by every day people.If you have a product or an idea and are thinking of marketing it on the internet, if you have never used the internet or find the whole prospect a complete mystery, Scott's book is a good place to start.Kudos to you Scott, keep writing books.-Craig Nybo, author of [ ... ]"
2,"Very Basic, low on resources and how to","It was vague, listed very few resources, and mostly just told stories of other people and their businesses. The writing is fine, but the subject jsut didn't teach me anything new. It even has basic 101 business advice, so if you have never run any biz or are brand new to the internet this is a good starter book, but really I'd look elsewhere. ""Plug Your Book"" by StevE WEBER WILL TEACH YOU MORE ABOUT internet marketing and places to check out. A new user will still find theirselves wondering wheredo I start at the end of this book. 3g internet marketing is another book much better than this."
2,"Maybe good for beginners, hardly for advanced internet entrepreneurs.","I had high hopes after reading reviews for this product but alas, they were dashed shortly after receiving product. Kind of hokey analogies and not a whole lot of real success stories you would want to identify with. All in all not a real great read unless you just discovered the internet yesterday in which case you'll love it!"
1,Internet Riches on a format that won't even work,"I have sophisticated stereo equipment from Denon, JBL, B&W and Bose, as well as a nice computer. I'm certainly not bragging so why would I mention all of that? Because none of them can even play this thing. This is an MP3 CD. That's all fine; I have burned my own MP3 CDs and made DVDs on my computer. So then, why wouldn't this one play? I don't know, but I can't recommend this to anyone else in good conscience. And really, I on;y gave it one star because Amazon required me to select at least one. I haven't even been able to listen to this thing."
4,useful perspective on how to find something that will be successful,Since reading this book I have worked on various Internet ventures. None have been very successful but it is a matter of finding a niche that will work. 10 failed venture and 1 big success is a success in total. It is a very useful perspective on how to find something that will be successful. I will update you again when I find that success.It is a book directed at the non-technical person and gives good direction on how to use Internet service companies so you don't have to worry about technical stuff.
3,Struggled Through This Book,"Even though the topic is a fascinating one. I struggled to complete this book. The author has a PhD in Comparative Literature and according to the book jacket, teaches creative writing course.I'm not sure how such an interesting topic could be written in such a dry manner, especially by someone who teaches ""creative"" writing. This book actually reads more like a doctoral thesis than a book for the mainstream audience. The author has written about the history of footbinding, eroticism and violence in China and how these are all entwined. The too-technical, overly-referenced, dense, academic writing style of the author has not done these topics justice."
3,The World Behind the Beauty in China,"Aching for Beauty is an extensive history of the tradition of footbinding in China. Women were defined by the size of one's feet, a sign of beauty.Wang Ping describes the sexual connotations related to footbinding. I think the book is good,but the contents contains a lot of history and research in order to comprehend the author's intent. The book is more interesting in the second half when Wang Ping desribes female bonding called Tan Chi where women share writing, poetry,and verbal stories. This book would be a great reference in regards to footbinding and Chinese tradition through centuries. It is not an easy read."
2,couldn't wade through it,"I am sure there is plenty of intellectual meat in this book, but I wanted to know more about the phenomenon and experience of footbinding, and this is more like a literary and sociopolitical analysis... Just not what I was looking for I guess..."
3,Essentially a huge essay,The book reads much more like a very long psycho-analytical English essay that relies on a lot of assumptions to comment on foot binding than actual historical details and analysis of foot binding. If you're trying to find a book that will educate you about the concrete whys and hows of foot binding you won't really find that here. If on the other hand you're interested in how Chinese literature sheds light on the supposed psyche and mores of Chinese men and women as it relates to foot binding you might enjoy it more. As a side note I think some of the analysis in the book was farfetched and filler material for a thesis.
4,another winner for Holly Jacobs,"I was very upset that the Duets line was stopped and had decided to avoid the new Flipside line since it was less of a value. However I decided to make an exception for Holly Jacobs since she is one of my favorite authors. I am so glad I did. Hung Up On You is yet another funny, romantic, and slightly naughty book by Holly Jacobs. The characters are interesting and well developed. The concept is fresh and the characters are lovable enough that you can't help but care about them. The setting is a little shallow compared to some of her previous books, but do you really read a romantic comedy for the back drop? I know that I don't. I'm glad I read Hung Up On You and I hope you do the same."
1,This book is bad,"Why is this book bad?It is bad because the characters are not interesting.It is bad because the situation is not plausible.But most of all it is bad because of the writing.The paragraphs are all short.Most paragraphs are no more than two sentences long.Holly Jacobs writes short paragraphs because she wants to make her book dramatic.She has to make her book dramatic with short paragraphs because the plot is dull and the characters are caricatures.If you like to read funny books about single women who find love, there are plenty of other funnier books for you to choose from.Don't bother with this one."
3,Still confused,"I think it is a great book for the older child or even adult who already has a basic working knowledge of physics and mathematics. The 13 year old beginner (such as my son, for whom it was bought) may not benefit substantially from this book, as I believe it assumes an existing knowledge of physics. The text could have included more explanations (in words), and examples of common problems to be solved."
2,So you are confused?,"So you are confused eh? You want to get more confused than you already are? Do you want to mess up on your physics test and get the information more messed up then it already is? If you do, then please go right ahead. I bought this book and found it to have a reverse affect."
4,It's doable,"This is a very sturdy book made with fine quality materials. It may last the average daily entry for decades. My personal preference is that there should not be a silly little promo sticker on the cover. The UPC label on the back was difficult enough to remove. Also, I would prefer that the ledger lines be lighter or even non existent. Ledger lines are for accountants and grammar school kids. Other blank books I've used leave all the fancy designs on the outside where they belong. (Everyone writes differently; individual thinkers don't need any lines telling them where to write.) I suppose that Flavia wanted to make an extra fancy diary for, ledger lines and all. In that sense, it works perfectly for most people as a daily diary."
3,"Good construction, bad sizing and shape","PROS: Good materials and finishing, light, strap nicely adjustableCONS: Helmet sizing charts (see Protech web site) are a little off. Using their charts, i determined my son, my wife and I could all wear larges. After receiving the helmets, I ended up having to get a medium for my son and an XL for myself. Part of the reason is simply that the helmet shells are misformed for the average head. It is too short from front to back, so it creates pressure on your forhead and back of head. Uncomfortable to say the least. I have helmets from Giro, Trek and Specialized and they all fit great, so its not our heads!I'm going to try and heat one up to see if I can reshape it a bit, otherwise I need to sell these on Ebay and get something that isn't deformed."
3,"Excellent Product, however the sizing is off significantly","I just purchased this helmet, and right off noticed the sizing is off significantly. According to Pro-Tec's sizing chart, I required (and ordered) an XLG. Upon acquisition of this helmet, it was immediately apparent that it was at least one full size too large. The helmet cannot be adjusted, and slid all over my head in an uncomfortable (and unsafe) manner. I'm currently attempting to exchange it with the vendor. I will update this review once I know more."
5,Cute curtains. Match comforter perfectly.,"I got it to go with the Olive Kids Trains, Planes, and Trucks set. It goes with the room well, and they are cute curtains. I was a bit hesitant about them when I got them out of the package, but they look great on the window."
2,Make sure you measure!,This drape was a foot too short for my window. The colors or patterns didn't really coordinate with the planes and trains set.
3,Good product but color is darker.,These arrived promptly but they are a little bit darker than pictured. My son has a royal blue room and I would say that these curtains would look better in a pastel blue room than a room with a darker shade of blue. The red in the tie backs are a nice contrast to the curtains but I've yet to put them up for fear of my toddler tearing them down.
1,Bad choice - drapes more dull than what is shown on website.,I got his for my son's room and I was very disappointed with my purchase. the color of the drapes was really dull and it didn't cover my window fully. Also the things used to hold the drapes together didn't have a good design
1,DO NOT BUY! BUG INFESTED!,"There is no 0 rating. Received this seed and it was totally disintegrated into powder from bug infestation! Just nasty. Then tried to return it on amazon site and there is no way to get a refund, only exchange. And NO customer service number for returns. PLUS, now I have to take the time to pack up the bug infested bag for return. I do not want a replacement bag!"
1,Summerville's book is racist and condescending,"It was found that in an official email this republican senator said he did not care what black people thought, specifically their representatives in the black caucus. This perspective comes across loud and biased in his book where he as a White man attempts to explain for his readers the experience of Black doctors from a saviour mentality. For decades people like Summerville have been telling the story of People of Color with no regard to what condescending tone it has. Do not buy this piece of crap unless you want something to use as a coaster or door stop."
5,Required Reading ...,"I just finished ""You Don't Look Sick"" and it is fantastic!! I am going to make it required reading for my Medical Family Therapy graduate students. It is the only book I know that has a clear and compelling view of the patient's process from symptoms to thriving, woven together with the physician's wisdom and voice. The process of reading the book creates for the reader an experience of collaboration and punctuates in it's evocative nature, the imperative of integrated and recursive care."
4,A nice help,"I have an auto-immune disease and often have trouble with folks not understanding that I am ill or how ill I am .... because ""I don't look sick"" , I don't have a cast on my leg, bandages... this book helps me deal with my internal dialogue and my process of dealing with some of these emotions. It has helped me deal with what to say to others as well."
5,You Don't Look Sick: Living Well With Invisible Chronic Illness,"This book is very helpful to one with a chronic illness and for someone trying to cope. I highly recommend that patients, doctors and family read it and be enlightened."
2,disappointed,"i, was expecting to see something on asthma. i, have suffered since birth with this disease. i, have lost jobs and endured discrimination, as a result of this age old disease.a freind, who knows my medical history personally, recommended the book to me, and i, ordered it the same day."
5,Suffering from illness.....,This book was suggested to me and I can't refer it enough to others suffering from any disease - terminal or not. I highly recommend this for all family members who AREN'T sick to read this - may help you understand and become compassionate towards those who are suffering!!!
3,Not quite the original London production.,This brought back great memories for those of us who saw the original west end production. Tim Rice says' its his final reworking of the story and song sequence. Some of the words have been changed and the songs aren't in the same order but I enjoyed watching it.
4,The Little Musical That Might,"Chess is a really odd musical. Despite the music being quite fitting, the story fits together a bit like a mad lib. The cast of this performance however does a spectacular job of making the best of what they have. Particularly good are David Bedella and Adam Pascal- both commit to their characters and are quite enjoyable to watch. Josh Groban does a interesting interpretation of Anatoly, making him a very sympathetic character; although a closer analysis of Anatoly also makes it apparent that he could just as easily be a rather callous jerk. Altogether, this musical is very enjoyable if you are willing to engage in a suspension of disbelief with regard to the story."
3,"Mostly good, could have been better.","I'm a HUGE fan of the musical CHESS, and never miss a chance to see it live and have seen it many times. I was really looking forward to this DVD. It was good. The casting: Josh Groban, Indina Menzel, Adam Pascal were excellent. The staging was good, except for the chorus. They were just a bit too cheesy for my liking. I was also confused at the addition of the cheerleading squad in the Merchandisers number in the first act. It was very distracting. My only other complaint was the unecessary use of the F-word in the second act, ""Talking Chess"" number between Freddie and Anatoly. It just really distracted from an otherwise good number. I honestly don't think I would have bought this DVD, had I known it had this profanity it in. Just a warning if those kinds of things bother you."
2,The BEST yet of Chess!,I saw the original London production twice; Broadway's once; several regional productions AND this staged concert version is the best..AND I hadn't before cared for Idina Menzel or Josh Groban!! It's truly Wonderful!
3,Chess in Concert,"The Chess, in my opinion is a poorly staged and produced musical that has a history of failure, at least from what I read about it on the internet. I bought this DVD because I thought that Josh Groban would be the main singer, but he wasn't. Idina Menzel, who also had a guest appearance in the Glee (she played Lea Mitchell's long lost mother) was the primary singer. I'm not a big fan of hers nor do I like her singing.Chess is a Broadway musical that dates back to the early 80s and is the music of Bjorn and Benny. I found this show to be quite boring and I only got through the first half hour before I decided not to watch anymore. I don't like the music and I couldn't quite figure out what was going on. If you are considering buying this DVD, check out the snippets of this concert on youtube first. If you don't like what you hear, you probably won't enjoy watching the entire show."
2,Stick With the Original,"The 2 star rating is for the music only. This is some of the greatest show music ever. The vocalists on this version are really poor, even Josh Groban (very nasal rendition version of ""Anthem""). The original (with Elaine Paige, Murray Head, Tommy Korberg, etc.) is the best version."
2,Disappointment,"I was so excited to see this production because I love Adam Pascal, Josh Groban and Idina Menzel. I was also excited to see and hear Kerri Ellis after reading reviews from her Elphaba run. But I was very disappointed in it. I didn't enjoy the story, the ""filler"" music didn't keep my interest, and the songs I have loved for so long didn't match up to versions already done. And I'm not just talking about Elaine Paige or Judi Kuhn (both of whom I love), but when you've heard Michael Ball's stirring rendition of Anthem, Josh Groban just didn't match up (which surprised me); or Lea Salonga's version of Someone Else's Story, Kerri Ellis didn't come close with her strange diction. So I'll just stick with listening to my favorites. I did enjoy the last You and I with Josh and Idina, and I'm glad they made it a DVD so I could finally see it."
2,Very Disappointing,"I've been a fan of this musical since 1984. I know almost every lyric by heart, so I was looking very forward to this DVD.I only had to get as far as Idina's first song to realize how disappointed I was going to be. For the life of me, I can't figure out why they chose her for this part. She simply does not sound good. It is is so awful for my ears that I haven't been able to get through the entire DVD - and I have had the DVD since release date - and don't forget, this is my favorite musical of all time (I only like rock musicals).It's a shame that one woman's voice so irritates me that I can't even bear to watch something that, when done right, I absolutely love.Adam Pascal irritates me, as well, but not nearly as much as Idina. Murray Head defined Freddy Trumper as a laid back, cool, character. Pascal brings to much power and rock and roll. He's too uptight.The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is because the music is so darned good and because Groban does such a great job."
5,Great service!,It was a Christmas present ordered at the last possible moment and it got here on time! Nice! It made Christmas much more fun!
5,excellent production.,"First heard the cd of chess several years ago. Great music! I then saw a mediocre play performance based on the CD. THis 2008 DVD was brilliantly conducted and the orcestra and singing was wonderful. The performances were first rate.After sveral years of trying to produce a play based on the story ""chess"", this was done right. Well done!!"
2,Disappointing,"While I hope more people are introduced to this musical, I found this production a disappointment. Josh Groban was surprisingly good singing musical theater, I hope he does more in the future. Adam Pascal's performance was also a treat; I had only seen him in Rent and thought his performance as The American was really outstanding.This musical has been a ""work in progress"" since the mid-80's. The original concept album is outstanding - if you haven't heard it, I strongly suggest you get it. When the production was brought to the US, they tweaked it - ugh. And they've been messing with it constantly since then.The result - what was a reasonably streamlined, musically gorgeous story has been chopped up and - I think - overengineered for the masses. Kind of dumbed down (and uglied up) in the process.Bottom line: if you want to own a musical performance of Chess, get the original concept album with Tommy Korberg, Murray Head and Elaine Paige. They got it right the first time."
2,Disappointed...,"I was upset at the book, to say the least. The characters were hollow...the story was not even sub-par. You never seemed to really understand the characters, drug addicts or not, they have no depth. Perhaps I should watch the movie..."
2,Save your money,"I have had 2 of these fail. Save your money and buy a better unit not a ""light"" model."
5,Tom And Jerry take on the masters,My son loves Tom and Jerry and I do too. This is a great re-telling of the Sherlock Holmes story from a unique perspective.
2,Didn't need my kids to see this one,"While the film is relatively true to the slapstick comedy of the standard Tom & Jerry cartoons I was not pleased with the overuse of ""sexy"" cartoon character and comedy created based on other characters response to the ""good lookin girl"".At this young an age I don't need my kids to be presented an idea that women are objects to be oogled over."
4,Bridget's Review,"I took my copy of Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes on DVD over to my nephews house and we watched it together. I love it when he really gets into a cartoon and starts laughing uncontrollably. He did that a lot during this movie. He had been watching a lot of Tom and Jerry on TV, so I was right when I thought he would enjoy this DVD."
4,Kiddos love this one!,"First how can you go wrong with Tom and Jerry, but now they meet Sherlock Homes! This is a great kid movie, and even the parents loved it!"
4,Great supplement for V: Dark Ages...MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY,"Having read the other reviews, I must agree that Clanbook: Ba'ali is quite graphic and it obviously offends some people. They shouldn't use it! Personally I feel that a Storyteller can use the book to really flesh out his Dark Ages story. I must agree with another ""reviewer""...I can't see a player having a Ba'ali character, but as a plot elements, story hook, etc.--YES! I was actually somewhat horrified by the content--GUESS WHAT!--it served it's purpose!!!!! Is this item shrink wrapped with parental advisory, etc? I can't remember...it should be."
4,"disgusting, yes. But they are EVIL after all","yes it is disturbing, but considering the premise of the entire game you had to expect at least one clan to be whacked, and they are. My only complaint is that they are SO twisted I can not let anyone play them because I don't think they could do justice to just how twisted they are."
4,Raving Beasts throughout the Night,"During my entire existance, which lasts for long, believe me, I have come across several of my race that, after careful observation, were accounted by me as Ba'ali. The wretchedness and total self sacrifice these childer give to their satanic rituals is astonishing, and yet it fills even me, an Assamite, with disgust and horror. Never have I Ended one of these, and never have I tasted their defiled blood. These may truly become the harbingers of the Jyhad of the munafiqun. Beware, you noble Vermin, both Ventrue and Lasombra, never underestimate the power of the ultimate Fiend...UTHER ALGAAN, ASSAMITE ELDER"
2,"A lot of loose threads, thin quilted material","This is a cheaply made ferret cube costing only a very small amount less than the fleece cubes. The metal clasps are not easy to work and damage the cage finish. The quilted material is thin, as is the 'plush' surface on the inside bottom. There are raw edges on the inside, which will catch on ferret claws, sometimes trapping ferrets until they are rescued. I will have to modify the cube before using it."
3,Sugar gliders love it,My sugar gliders love this cube. The only problem is that it sags in the middle when they lay in it as there's no support to hold its shape but they don't seem to mind. They spend a lot of time in it. I have washed in washing machine and it held up well.
5,AWESOME BOUGHT LOCALLY,Bought this a couple months ago and my baby girl loves it! she can play around in it or have a nice comfy place to sleep! It Is SO ADORABLE when she is sleeping and has her head poking out.
1,Don't expect to receive the colorway that you see,"I ordered 4 of these cubes, I have owned this item previously. I expected to receive the multicolored cube that is shown. NOOOOOO, I recieved pink cubes,PINK. I am very upset that they just send you what ever they want to, to hell with what you ordered. Very Unhappy"
4,Fair Price for Faucet,"This faucet was one of the less expensive faucets and included a pull-out spout, which eliminates the need for a sprayer on the side. It is easy to install (I did it myself, and I am no plumber). My only criticism is that the spray function is too gentle, more like a ""shower"" than a vigorous spray. That is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star rating."
2,Economy Grade Faucet,"This item is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" situations. It's not terrible, and it functions as it should, but it feels ""cheap"" in hand and not really a heavy duty faucet. The handle and the sprayer seem longer in the product photo than they actually are. Pay attention to the dimensions in the description. The ""spray"" is very gentle and not a hard spray, even with excellent water pressure.Installation note: The connections are very difficult to get through the sink nut. You have to compress the sprayer hose, almost folding it in half to get the 4 different connections through the nut. You will not need a sink wrench to set this faucet."
5,Kitchen Faucet,Great product and beautiful finish. This a great price for the quality of this faucet.
3,Kitchen sink Faucet.,"It looks just as it appears in the picture. However the pull out nozzle is a bit hard to operate, it keeps getting stuck often and is a bit flimsy and cheap. The faucet looks good and its also good for the price."
5,Danze D455612SS Melrose,I have had this faucet for about a year now and it seems to be working very well. It is well constructed and I assume it will last for a long time. It would give it a 4 1/2 star.
3,Stylish but wish there were better instructions,"This really looks very stylish in my kitchen. I am one of those DIY guy who tried to install this myself in my kitchen sink. I got the setup wrong without thinking much into where the soap dispenser could've been placed. Wish there was some kind of instruction on different possibilities / configurations on the sink. My sink had different holes and I put the soap dispenser and the bottom plate in places I can't change now after gluing them on. I wanted a hole to be available for my dish washer aeration and probably one for the water filter, but now, I can't do them.Normal plumbers or people who knows installation of kitchen equipment probably would really like this."
4,not how i remembered,"purchased product in early 90's. the fragrance smell somewhat the same, but does not last as long as it did then. maybe the shelf life took away from the longevity of the smell. the price for the size not bad at all, the smell just doesn't last as long; at least from the bottle that i purchased."
3,It's ok,I using the same cologne for last few years but this bottle i got from Amazon is smell little different and i don't really like the new smell.but it is OK not really too bad.
3,Its ok,"I think the smell is nice but to be honest no women have come up to me and say "" you smell great"" or ""what is that your wearing"" and my wife thinks its not so great. So you can roll the dice on this one."
5,A great purchase,My father passed this kind of cologne on to me when I went on my first dance. Ive been using it ever since. Its a fantastic product and I get a lot of people tell me that it smells great. So I recommend.
2,cologne changed,"I have used this cologne for the past twelve years.Receiving compliments was a very common thing,but for the last year and a half that doesn't happen anymore.Something has changed in the way they make it.Ever since Liz passed away whoever is making this stuff has changed the formula.Its like there is very little fragrance at all and it doesn't last.What a shame....So much for a good product!"
5,I should submit a video review instead ;),"Women LOVE it. Theyve probably never heard of it, and its reasonably price at $20 for a 4oz bottle. I highly recommend it."
1,This cologne is terrible.,"There is absolutely no shot that the reviews for this item are 100% legitimate. I bought into the hype and decided to see if I could find a cheap bottle of cologne, bad move. I have literally sprayed it one time and I highly doubt I will ever use it again. Honestly, I don't usually write reviews for items I buy on Amazon, but I'm hoping somebody will read this and realize the other reviews are a complete scam."
2,not that great.,"so many reviews about this cologne, so I had to try it, well, it is not great, it is like a cologne for really old people, I can not return it so I just put it back in the box and took it to the salvation army, I am sure someone will like it. wasted of money here..."
3,Quite uneven.,"A somewhat random assortment of topics. For example the section on computer starts with 5 pages on the history of microprocessors, starting with the Intel 4004 and 8008! Only a few pages on flight simulators. Read through the preview carefully to decide if you are interested in the topics he covers."
4,cute for Spideerman fans 5 and under,"one of the cutest spideys I have ever seen but dont buy it for a boy older than 5 more for the little guy.So cute sings several songs...Hands,shoulder knees and webs...If your happy and you know it spin a web...soooo cute"
5,Spidy Fun,My 21-month old son absolutely loves this toy. He enjoys the singing and playing with the included microphone. I'm not sure of the quality or if it was just a fluke. The first singing Spider-Man I purchased stopped working after about 6 months. Then I purchased this one about a month ago. So far so good but you can never tell.
3,Just OK,"I bought this for my boys (3 and 5 at the time) and I think it is just OK.It plays three songs I believe, and the lyrics are re-worded to fit Spider Man. This only confused my kids, as they wanted to sing along to these well known songs, but Spider Man was ""messing them up"".On a plus side the ""echo michrophone"" is kinda cool, and they still play with this by itself."
4,Public Opinion: developments and controversies in the twenti,Good for post graduates students persueing decision making and also political science. The critical thought put forward by the auther would help scholars to understand the important role of the public opinion.
5,Easy to Use,I love how you have everything in the project can be manipulated so easily. When I bought this I was worried that it would be difficult for this 70 year young senior. It produces top quality cards for every special occasion. I find myself making cards for my family and friends just for fun.
1,Hallmark Card Studio,"I wrote upon returning the product that both Hallmark and Amazonshould be ashamed to send such a poor product. The colors on the card were not good and the software was so faulty. It would print the sayings on top of each other, not centered.I had an earlier product from Microsoft that had beautiful cards and selections that I used for many years but got outdated and would not install. I asked and hopefully have received a complete refund."
5,Easy to use,"I purchased this software with some suspision. Previous Hallmark Card making programs that I had purchased functioned poorly and you were limited with what you could do. I have also purchasedother card making programs from American Greetings, Annoucements and Broderbund. This is the easiest to use and gives you a lot of variety. The clip art is a little disapointing but the product on the whole makes up for it. I have created cards and added sound and music to e-cards for family and friends. They are always amazed and ask how I did that. They are even more tickled with photos that I can add. I have used this software to print out personalized Christmas cards and envelopes. I am thinking about purchasing the 2006 software, for new graphics and clip art."
1,Do not waste your $$,"This is a 5 page book that suggests you take a specific vitimin each day and quit coffee, something that all migraineurs probably already do. Do not waste you $$ on this book. It's yet another attempt to get desperate people in pain to buy a fake product. Amazon should be ashamed that they are selling this book."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I forgot I had bought this crappy set. Cheap wooden box, cheap knives. I am used to high quality German knives. I think I tried these out once, and forgot I bought them for over 3 years...maybe I can dump them at a garage sale.. lol"
4,It's ok,You can get your dogz back now if they run away. I have dogz 4 and dogz 5 is alot better! It has GRRRREAT new breeds but the german sheperd stinks. Everything else is pretty good though! I hope you buy it!!!! You really hav to see it!
4,Dogz 5-had issues,"I liked this game, however: the game keeps not loading fully. It either has to do with my computer or the disc. I got the disc from this software attic place and aside from the game REFUSING to load, the game is great."
3,"its ok, not the best","I only play dogz 5 because I run a petz site, in which I breed alot of petz and put them up for adoption. ... (its fun sometimes though)P.F. Magic is way better at hexing than ubi soft.But I do like the fact that instead of having to travel back and forth, the toyz are right there in your travel/supply case, but you can't put flowers in a vase anymore.The salon definetly isn't what I expected,I mean the catz love taking baths and dogz hate it, what's up with that? The nightlights (which you put over an outlet in the family room or nursery) actually work, which is kinda cool.The nursery is more human like than it is animal like. The petz won't go to sleep in the crib even when you turn the mobile on.So it kinda sucks and its kinda cool."
4,good but boring,"dogz5 was a nice game to play for a week or so.when you frist get it and you start playing it its a fun game.but when you play it a lot it gets so BORING!the only things you do is play,feed,bath,teach,and do little games.unlike the game babyz you play,feed,bathe,change diapers,teach babyz how to walk and talk,you can also talk to them with a microphone.so i think babyz is a better game then dogz5.i hope this helps you."
1,not the best petz game...,"ubi did a very poor job of debugging this program. it hardly runs and it crashes a lot. none of the games work and it takes up a ton of disk space. it installs extra stuff that it shouldn't w/o prompting (direct x, acrobat, who knows what else...) petz 3 is the best version imo, if you have win 95/98, get p3 instead."
5,COOL!,This game is SOOOOO fun! You will never get bored with it.All the dogz are SO cute! You HAVE to get this game! It is TOTALY fun! I LOVE it and I know you will too!
4,Lots of Activities!,"I have not played it a lot so far, but it is fun. I still have not figured out some of the mini games, so it is challenging. The dogs are cute and do funny things."
3,Fun despite a few bugs,"The newest version of Dogz adds a few more breeds, though the pig option is taken away. The best part of this one is the new play areas and the fact that the ""suitcase"" is now the ""toy closet"". The toys have to be earned from playing games in the new areas, but most are not so challenging that young children would have any troulbe.This version is supposed to be XP compatible, but I have still experienced a few bugs causing it to shut down unpredictably."
3,Dogz 5 -gift for grandson,"Bought this for my five year old grandson. He initially was enthralled but lost interest fairly quickly. I think part of that was because it was a bit old for him and some of the instructions were a challenge for him to read and understand but part of it was the limitations of the actions. Since it is supposed to simulate ""real"" pet ownership on some level that was sort of OK. By the time we found instructions on how to put the pet away or get it to perform some action focus was gone.I would recommend this for an older child though; a seven or eight year old might have become more engaged with the adopted pet and have and easier time then a five year old and an over fifty did. It has some fun activities to do with the pet(s), great play settings like a beach, snow scape, and haunted castle, and quick response time to changes and commands."
3,"Ubisoft (...), but the petz community rocks!!!","I think Ubisoft (...) personally. The breeds do not look realistic in this game and you have to play stupid mini games to get toys. I know 30 year olds who play this game. How old do you think mini games make them feel? Anyway, Ubisoft could have improved the actual POINT of the game which is to take care of dogs instead of just adding mini games, more toys, and a stupid nursery made for HUMAN babies!!! But, the reason why I love this game is because of the petz community online. They have hexed many realistic breeds that are far more accurate than the ones Ubisoft hexed. Also, you can show dogz online and enter them into obedience etc. at the PKC (petzkennelclub.co.uk).So, if you love dogs, dog shows, and interacting with people, get this game, go online and show your dogz!!!! (...)"
2,Good but gets bo-ring,Ya i got Dogz 5 it wasnt the best.It was good for a couple of days and then BoOm it was so bo-ring i tired to play this game 13 times(and counting)before i got up and went to do something else.I mean all you do in this game is watch you dont do anything else you first feed or play with your pet then you watch and watch and watch for them to be finished and then you leave trust me dont spend your $$$ on this game.I hope this helps you.
1,catz/dogz,"the games are cool. i have all of them except 1,3,and 4. i hope to get 5 for christmas. the others are really cool but i get bored after a while i hope this one is better"
5,this is NOT a review just here to post info.,"In the new version of Dogz you can enjoy multiple litters of puppyz, new weather effects and day and night cycles in graphically updated playscenes, including five new places to play with your dogz. Dogz can now have up to 4 puppyz in a litter. There are 5 new dogz breedz added.you can play minigames also! You can play 5 minigames in all. Last but not least there are new and improved 24-bit graphics that are simply marvelous!"
3,Dogz 5,"This would be a great game for smaller children. It is a little older, probably made in the 90's but it is very cute and would be great for kids that love animals."
3,Small Dictionary,This is a very small Dictionary and handy to keep by my computer. However in being so small(the smallest I have seen) it limits the amount of words. The print is small and rather difficult for older people to see. But just the same it is useful as a large dictionary would be awkward for my use.
3,Desk reference,"I have another dictionary that I keep that is in stack with other books and such , so wanted a quick reference when computer was off. This is a pocket sized item like the Digital scale I recently reviewed , easily fits in inside pocked of Coat or Jacket. It's difficult to rate this item since I think it's difficult to actually make a bad dictionary.The good thing I like when I just looked at it again is that the pronunciation table is on the third page. I use this page to help my children , I.E. young adults now speak and say words correctly. I know I need more help than they do at times but this is a good thing about being right on the third page."
3,You gotta have very good vision,"Very fine print, difficult to read. You need to do big effort to read. Shipping was fast and free. I had to get another dictionary with bigger print."
4,Handy but not a good choice for older persons,"This pocket-size dictionary is very light weight. It has reasonable amount of words for its size. However, people above 40 years old may have difficulty reading it since the font is on the smaller side. I guess it is a trade-off the publisher has to make."
3,Quick shipment but low quality product,Shipping is very quick. I got it 4 days after placement order.But this dictionary is too small and doesn't have a lot of words.20% of my interested words could not be found in this dict.
1,Disappointment,This dictionary is much smaller than expected. The descriptions are very brief. Big disappointment.
3,Merriam-Webster's Pocket Dictionary,"Useful pocket dictionary, but why no ""Foreign Words and Phrases"" ? I and my family have been greatly indebted to the Merriam-Webster's Pocket Dictionary from the 1940s where the classy Latin section at the end of the dictionary serves to remind one of how rich human language can become if we are occasionally prepared to appropriate the elusive mot juste from a foreign language ! Also, it would be more enriching than a section of Abbreviations that are, after all, only a part of our culture's ephemera and not as lasting or deep-rooted as our reliance on Latinisms. That is the most obvious omission from the newer editions and I hope that it doesn't start a trend."
2,okay.,handy tool but having a great dictionary on the kindle already... there is no point on the kindle store.
1,Not what I want!,"This is the second time I have attempted to get a usable dictionary for my Kindle Fire HD. What I want is a dictionary to use at any time, not just for a word when I am reading. Why doesn't Kindle Apps have a dictionary like that, and why did they bother to build-in the unusable kind? The orginal Kindle had great dictionaries."
3,SO SO,"This dictionary is good, but I am not at all happy with the search capabilities of it on my kindle. It could be improved to be more user friendly."
4,Informative and compact..,This little book packs a lot of information..easy to carry and store ..great for middle schoolers .. easy to use and priced right..
3,Print too small!,Wish the dimensions of the book were listed in the description - I would have known the print was going to be small.
4,Great 1st Dictionary,"I got this dictionary for my 6-yr-old, and while the type is small, everything about it is great for him - size, weight, etc. So if you require reading glasses, like me, it may not be ideal in a pinch. But for a child who loves words and learning and wants to take it to school in his backpack, it's perfect."
4,good book; good deal,"the transaction was smooth, quick and easy. product was as described. everything was great and had no problems. good doing business with you."
1,Don't buy it!,"After only being used three times pages are falling out! As a book of this type is in daily use, this is not good. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,"Even better than McKinsey's earlier work, believe it or not","This reference guide is particularly useful for quick location of verses and concepts that arise in discussions or debates, although it provides satisfying reading all by itself. A simple rating system gives the reader the best verse(s) to use in addressing a particular topic. The section on Jesus has been enlarged and given special attention, particularly in the area of alleged OT prophecies of the coming of a Messiah . Want to know what extrabiblical sources, such as Josephus or Tacitus, had to say about Jesus or early Christianity? They are given critical scrutiny here. As McKinsey says in his introduction, ""...if you are tired of having Bible-quoting friends, relatives, and acquaintances toss Scripture in your face and would like to have an avalanche of information to toss in theirs...."
4,Biblical Errancy: A Reference Guide,"C. Dennis McKinsey's work on this book is an amazing piece of scholarship. At over 800 pages it provides the most comprehensive catalog of Biblical contradictions, ambiguities and errors of fact I have ever seen. Although it can be read from beginning to end, it is primarily a reference work that documents the problems of using the Bible as a source to validate one's views.After reading this book, I shall never again justify any view I hold with the phrase, ""because the Bible says so."" To quote from the play Inherit the Wind,""It's a good book, but it's not the only book."""
3,Biblical Errancy,"Very useful as a KEY to issues of inconsistency, but should be used as a guide for individual research and rational analysis of the full contexts of quotations, only, as some of his thinking is shallow, often due to a ""looseness"" of application of English-language word meanings. Even for an innate sceptic of bible inerrancy, such as myself, A FEW of his conclusions appear designed to fulfil his ""errancy"" objective, rather than reflecting an unbiased search for the truth, which, after all, is what genuine scholars will be looking for. Use of the material as a basis for research should be accompanied by a dispassionate approach to futher reasoned analysis of the issues he raises. Much will be confirmed; some will raise doubts."
5,water pump works fine,This water pump pumps the water. So that being said it works just fine. No problems. Appears to be good quality and it works!
3,Was Expecting Better LIVE Stuff,"Big MRH fan! Have seen them live 4 times in ft. lauderdale,(with J Mann & Waylan), The live show is great! they're music is great! Wish they would do a whole live show(with at least 4or5 cameras)on the DVD. They do one song(1 camera from drummers -Stitch- view,the audio SUCKS).The music videos are cool(whats up with the chicken?), After buying Vol.1,(3 years ago)(WHICH I LIKED BETTER) Hoped Vol.2 would be a little better production level.Some of the ""Day-in-the-life"" stuff was funny(some nice Booby shots)All-in-All, If you love MRH you'll like the DVD(it was worth the $8 i spent)- M U S H R O O M H E A D R O C K S -"
4,A Great Page Turner!,"When a colleague suggested I read this book I was expecting a really bland read. Boy, was I surprised! This book is very well written and filled with lots of good and interesting information. A newer book that goes into great detail on oil economics, reserves, etc. and vulnerabilities post-9/11 is Terrorism & Oil by Neal Adams. It's a real eye-opener."
2,Not that interesting,"I have been dragging my feet to finish reading this book. It is not well-organized and full of opinions without solid arguments. Therefore, it is dry and hard to read. To the author's credit, a lot is covered in this thin book. If it had been expanded, the reader could have enjoyed it more."
1,Book fails to be credible,"I read this book to update my understanding of the oil industry. Given that both authors are oil industry insiders and academics, I was expecting meticulous research and claims backed by data. The book disappointed on both counts. Enough that even though I invested time in this book, I am currently looking for an alternate book to fill gaps in my oil knowledge."
1,Childlike and frustrating,This over-simplistic view of the industry does Economidies no honor. It appears to be more of a rush to get his name in print than to do anything in support for or to the decline of the real history of the industry.
2,Too Heavy-Handed,"Overall this is a decent book about the energy business, but could do with a little more fact and a lot less opinion. The attacks on the environmentalists and other critics of the oil industry are a distraction and add about zero value to ones overall understanding of the business."
5,love it,just wat i was looking for thank you much...enjoy listening to my new cd these are my jams really happy
3,"great book, but not that helpful","I bought this book because of the great reviews here. I am a new homeschooling mom, and needed some ""specific"" information to help get me started.This book is a great ""general"" book,but lacked the specifics i was looking for."
3,MIDDLE OF THE ROAD!,"This book is good for someone just starting out in homeschooling that needs the basics. Though I've been homeschooling for just over a year, it did offer me some helpful hints, though it's definitely geared to those just needing some of the nuts & bolts of homeschooling.Of those just starting out that need to know more-you should read more. This is the sixth or seventh book I've read dedicated to homeschooling-like my children, I'm constantly learning.The negatives I have for this book are: a. It is outdated (VHS, no dedicated websites for many companies (though easy enough to look up online)); and b. Some of the pages just fell out-they didn't do very good binding at the publishing house.All in all it's a good starter book for those entering the homeschooling arena!"
5,Jenn,"Given to my grand-daughter for Christmas....she loves ""The Rankin Family"" especially when travelling in the car.....on our way to our special camping holiday!"
2,to smelly,"Very nice product, and well made, but it made my eyes burn from the combustion products not venting to the outside ( I live in a travel trailer). And I became more sensitive to it in a short amount of time, so I stopped using it."
2,OK - Manufacturer needs to build in more durability,"Over the years we have bought several of this model pedometer. The unit works well; however, the clip breaks too easily. We had one that broke in 1 week, and we had one that lasted 1 year. It is ""hit and miss."" Also, sometimes the counter gets screwed up, and the step count is way off.We really like the unit compared to other models. The design and functions are great. We like it even more as the price comes down. (The unit used to cost more than $20) My feeling on all electronic pedometers is that the unit costs less than $0.50 to make (including the chip). Considering the price, the manufacturer could afford to build a more durable model."
1,Not like it used to be,"I have used this pedometer for years. I would get about a year's service and accurate measurements. Most important, it has a clasp that is big enough to hold on my belt rather than falling off. Despite this, it is usually the clasp that fails, gets twisted, drops on the floor one to many times. If I could get a year's service, I was satisfied. But recently I replaced my pedometer. It was noisy (rattling as I walked) and significantly under-measured my steps. I returned it for replacement. Same problem. Sadly, I'm giving up on this brand."
1,order the old one from amazon; this one is junk,"I saw someone else's review and had to comment. I bought the new 345 sportline pedometer on sale at Sear's because my old one was falling apart. After clipping it on, I took about 2 steps, bent down to pick something up and I had already registered over 20 steps. I returned it, went home and taped up my old one! I added a stay-put clip from another junk pedometer I got free from an event and I'm still going (have changed the battery twice). Like the other reviewer said, BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL SPORTLINE 345! The new one can't be worn all day, just during exercise. (So accumulating 10,000 steps throughout the day only counts if you remember to put it back on everytime you stand up). Good thing I can order the old one here on Amazon.com. It costs more than I used to pay for it at K-mart, but it's worth it compared to this junk!"
2,OK -,"it records steps pretty accurately; it wasn't at all durable though. within 3 weeks of daily use the clip/spring mechanism had ""popped"" on one side and broke. I also had MANY problems with it resetting during the day and with the stride length being reset (?). I am assuming that after such a short use that the batteries are alrady low. it also recorded movements (such as using restroom) as steps. I liked this one because I thought that the larger clip would hold to waistbands better - but this wasn't really the case. one that i got much cheaper was more accurate and durable overall."
2,OK but reset button was too sensitive,"I got this one since the cheap one my comany was giving out was worn out. It recorded steps accurately, but if I moved wrong and it the reset button, I would loose all my information. Decided to buy a Omron HJ112 to replace it."
1,Totally disappointed,This is the second one we've purchased. The first didn't work at all and now the second one is far from accurate. I have a 345 Translucent Sportline that I got for a Christmas present and it works wonderfully. I got this one for my husband and discovered it had been revamped. Bring back the old version!!
1,Sportline Junk,"Bought this Sportline 345 a year ago and it doesn't work right. Same distance walked one day was 4700 steps and next day 2400. Tested at home and it skips steps, sometimes 4 to 1. Junk. Buy Omron or Timex and save yourself a headache and $20."
2,Hinge breaks easily,"The hinge on this pedometer just broke-I have had it for a year. I have another pedometer I used at the same time as this one and found the Sportline not to be accurate. Also, It tends to fall off your belt very easily. I wouldn't buy another one."
1,want to chuck this thing off a mountain top,"this sportline pedometer is not just inexpensive, it's cheap.the item resets itself in the middle of a long walk, switches from mi to km if an article of clothing brushes against it.the user is unable to maintain in use stats when trying to go back to the original setting.total waste of money.i should've put the $14.00 aside and used that money toward a fitbit."
2,What a disappointment!,"I wanted to like this book - I really did. It brings up an ambitious thesis then barely pays it mind, opting instead to spend page after page on less interesting topics. Not internally coordinated at all, it seems more like a compilation of unrelated writings and less like a comprehensive approach to the subject. Back up Dr. Blaha, and try again!"
1,"Should be called ""1 Step to a 1""","Avoid this review book. I am a teacher of Calculus, and I am going to teach AP Calculus next year. Unlike most students who need to review, I already know the material 100%. I was SHOCKED by the amount of errors and misprints that are in this book. If you are a student who doesn't know Calculus that well, you are going to think that YOU are the one making errors, but it is the book that is wrong. I contacted the publisher, and they have yet to give me a decent response. I feel this book should be pulled from the shelves. They should title it ""1 Step to a 1"", and the one step is to buy this book."
1,"no so good, don't buy this book!!",I am studying calculus currently in my ap class. I bought this book. And I found out there are many misprints and errors there.
5,The Art of Winning Commitment by Dick Richards,"I had always viewed myself as a pretty successful leader, but the insights I gained from reading this book have caused me to step back and review aspects of my leadership style that have evolved over a 25 year period. This excellent book calls on leaders to honestly assess the way they lead and communicate with their people in areas that for some are in uncharted waters - i.e., the emotional and spiritual dimensions. The book is not only insightful but is written so clearly and simply that its messages are very easy to grasp. I recommend this book for any leader who wants to raise her or his performance to the next level."
3,"Amusing and thoughtful, but not first-rate Cosby","I have to agree with the reviewer who said that Cosby's material just doesn't translate well to the printed page. Most of this book is composed of anecdotes, commentary, and a little bit of biography that's mildly amusing.If you're a Cosby fan, however, you should buy this book for the bit about the bug in the first chapter (""Oh, Baby!""), which is laugh-out-loud, roll-on-the-floor funny. Though I've never heard Cosby do this routine in his stand-up, I can see him incorporating it."
2,Disappointing,"Bill Cosby is a very funny guy. His spoken delivery has left me in stiches countless times, but unfortunately his humor didn't carry over into print very well in this case. The writing is flat and awkward, and the chapters seem to wander without purpose. George Booth's drawings, however, are delightful as always."
4,Uneven funny,"If you like funny little stories you'll like this book. If you like Cosby's standup routines in a short version, you'll like this. Otherwise you may or may not like this book. This is basically a few of his short routines or anecdotes put together in a book. There's no real theme that ties all of them together nor or all of them on the same level of funny. Some will appeal more than others. I give it a C on the StuPage."
3,"Good, but not great","Your money is better spent buying old Cosby albums. The first two ""essays"" in this collection are almost word-for-word transcriptions from the two bits on his ""Oh Baby!"" that lose a lot of their pop in written form.Better yet, just buy the Himself VHS."
3,"Great product, when it lasts","This review is only for this specific green spatula, not the other Trudeau solid silicone spatulas.I own several of these spatulas and love the design. One solid piece of silicone rather than a connection to a plastic handle that collects food. The silicone is soft so it actually conforms to whatever you are scraping...unlike the cheaper versions that are too ridgid to accurately do the job.The green one, however, didn't last. After only 6 months it cracked where the internal support runs from the handle to the spoon. The other ones have lasted longer but don't get as much use. I expected better quality on these.I'm giving it 3 stars because the other ones I own are still in good shape and I love them. Be careful when picking your sizes. The orange one is HUGE while the blue one is a bit smaller than I thought (but quite functional). This one would be a perfect size if it didn't crack."
3,"Decent, but not durable.","Silicone spatulas are a great idea, but this one didn't last nearly as long as I'd expected it would. It developed a crack on the back of the spatula after about a year of normal use and exclusive hand-washing. That crack is an ideal place for food and bacteria to hide, so I had to pitch it. I wouldn't be so bothered, except I have silicone spatulas from the dollar store that have lasted longer and worked just as well. I'll be sticking with the 2 for $1 from Dollar Tree from now on!"
4,Wrong Color Shown,It's a great spoon/spatula. Everything I expected EXCEPT for the color. It is shown as a pretty green; in reality it is 60's era avocado. Not a big deal unless you are trying to match kitchen color schemes. Picture should more accurately depict the product.
5,Trudeau Silicone Spatula,"I bought this product because of it single ""mold"" design. With the normal 2-pieces spatula, food always gets in to the joint (between spatula and handle). I bought 4 of them in different sizes and love them all."
5,Perfect Spatula for Omelettes,Totally sanitary and resistant to high heat. Very flexible tip. This is the perfect spatula for making omelettes or any other cooking where a flexible end is useful. I love this little unit.
5,Great Spatula!,These are the very best spatulas I've ever used. They scrape great and they never melt or curl under too much heat. I ordered a bunch of them. You will want one of every size.
4,REAL talent w/ lots of water!!,"I'm just a guy who loves water (scuba & sea-doo). I saw BlueCrush & really loved the surfing footage. Soo I decided to go get a surf dvd. This was the only one I could find, but I didn't get it for the bikinis! These ladies have got more guts than most guys & it shows thru in their surfing! The locations are absolutely gorgeous & the surfing added to the beauty of the scenery. There are a few interviews & it was interesting to learn more about these ""Wave Warriors"". They really enjoy what they do & that's a pretty rare thing these days! My faves: Megan Abubo, Heather Clark, & Keala Kennelly - nearly every time they're onscreen, they show you why they're so admired by their fellow surfers! Definitely a water-lover's delight w/ some of the most amazing athletes I've ever seen on the water - or below it! :)"
1,They havnt' shipped the item after 5 weeks.,I would like to review the item but they have not shipped the item.I ordered on 10/15/04 and as of today's date 11/22/04 the item has not been shipped. Shipping date has been pushed back twice. Now the est. ship date is 11/29/04 to 12/6/04. I may receive the item after waiting two months. Amazon stil lists the item as ususally ships in 1 - 2 weeks. Don't believe it.Bottom line if you need the heater this winter don't bother ordering this unit. If you need it for winter of 2006 you should be fine.
5,Excellent Book!,"Danish Ahmed has a firm grasp of language, and uses this discerning skill to examine the meaning of words inherent in our daily communications that we often take for granted. And in doing so Danish shines a torch of understanding, of wisdom even, on the great significance words have in shaping our perceptions, our attitudes and our lives. Highly recommended."
3,"Good, yet get more information","I wouldn't say I am a fanatic Nin fan but a really really big fan. Tommy Udo wrote a great book it gives a lot of good information and goes over the history pretty well. But He made a mistake. There is a part in one of the first chapters where he is explaing the albums. And he said that the Live Album was called And All That Might Have Been. When in fact it is titled And All That Could Have Been. And he takes quotes out of context. Where one time he says that Trent Said. ""I see that I am saving Rock n' Roll. billy Corgan failed, now it's all up to me."" He said that in this context ""people are saying that I see that I am saving Rock n' Roll, Billy Corgan Failed, so it's up to me whenI really don't ever like Rock that much"". Great book though, he just needs to leave thigns the way they are."
1,Horrible...just simple horrible.,Do not read this book at all. It is very horrible and within the first couple chapters I felt like burning it. It is very in accurate and is not worth a single dollar.
3,Hard to shake off the overwhelmingly annoying character of Megghy,"Ginger and Cinnamon has some funny moments. We thought it was cute and enjoyable fluff and - as others have noted here - it's interesting to get a slice-of-life look at party island life in Greece, literally and no doubt accurately depicted as swarmed by young singles from around the world. One of director Daniele Luchetti's interesting touches is to intersperse eight or so moments where real-life revelers introduce themselves to the camera. No doubt this movie sent the tourist travel to Ios Island through the roof...as if it needed it.Not much to say about the movie itself. It was pretty hard for me to shake off the overwhelmingly annoying character of Megghy (Martina Merlino) as a self-centered 14-year-old ham-handedly attempting to lose her virginity. We needed less of Merlino and more of the winsome Stefania Montorsi - naturally beautiful and likable in the Giovanna Mezzogiorno mold."
2,"harmless fluff, only mildly entertaining","Meggy, a silly Italian 14-year-old intent on losing her virginity, takes a trip to a Greek island -- ""the Island of Love"" -- with her 30-year-old aunt, Stephania, who has just broken off an eight-year relationship. The island seems to be populated solely by young people intent on partying, drinking, sun-bathing, getting high and making love.Various trivial complications ensue, the ex-boyfriend shows up and proves to be just as moody and immature as everyone else -- and there is also a weird Bollywood interlude where the principals lip-sync and dance to a song hailing the positive attributes of smoking.The main attraction here is Meggy's strange misconceptions of what it means to be an adult -- but all the characters are terminally childish, shallow and uninteresting.Sorry, can't really recommend this much. It's pretty harmless like eating cotton candy, but not very nutritious."
3,Nonsensical Drivel,"The trailer for ""Ginger and Cinnamon"" made me laugh aloud, so against my better judgment I rented the DVD. WOW - Viewers will really have to suspend disbelief for this one. Since when does an adult in charge of a minor (a 14 year old girl determined to lose her virginity, no less) let her charge run unsupervised day and night on a partying Greek island? The over abundance of coincidences are eye-rolling as well. Speaking of eyes, I nearly had to put toothpicks in mine to stay awake before the movie ended.Nevertheless, I'm giving ""Ginger and Cinnamon"" a generous three stars, since it is merely dopey instead of obnoxiously offensive, and I realize that ""dopey"" equals ""entertaining"" to some. In addition, one can get a glimpse of Greece. In Italian, with subtitles."
2,Just not the same,"If you're into classical music, you know how different the same symphony performed by two different conductors and orchestras can sound. Same here. If you really love this score like I do, I think you'll be disappointed in the difference in sound compared to the original. I'd give this a higher rating if it was the only version available. But since the original is available on CD, there's no reason to buy this imposter. There's only 5 minutes more from Lion in Winter, and the mini-Mary score is nothing special."
5,the best on Istanbul,"The maps are the most useful of any of the Istanbul travel books I have seen; although this book gives history and analysis, it is not too in depth, as the Knopf book can be, so that you lose sight of where you are. The tours laid out in this book contain references to small cafes and shops and restaurants that none of the others do. It is a 1998 version so is very up-to-date. Excellent book."
5,Eyewitness consistency,"Seriously good colour production, with great maps and cutaways. Hasn't got the historical depth of a Blue Guide, but this series exists for a different purpose, and this one hits the mark. It has information on just about everything the visitor would want to see and do, and it would be a useful companion for someone living in the city for a period of time. There is another, similar series called 'Everyman Guides' which do not appear to be available on amazon. The publisher is David campbell of London. I have their Istanbul guide as well. It does some things similarly to Eyewitness, and the colour is as good. It, however, takes a thematic approach, so there are chapters on things like Istanbul as seen by painters or writers. I think both volumes are excellent, and provide good reading in preparation for a trip, or armchair daydreaming!Having lived in Istanbul, I would have welcomed both these books."
4,The best guide for tourists; OK for business travelers.,"This is pretty much the definitive English-language guide for tourists. You'll see people toting it along at all of the major historical attractions - with good reason. Like most Eyewitness guides, it is incredibly user-friendly. This book has it all - useful maps, readable background facts, helpful travel tips. My favorite feature is the list of the top ten sites. My only complaint is that the maps do not include the business districts - a serious oversight for the business traveler. Nevertheless, no one should go to Istanbul without a copy of this book close at hand.Since I wrote this review two years ago, I have lent the book to 8 people who were traveling to Istanbul, and they've all raved about it. I was on a plane the other day making a connection through Istanbul and a distant acquaintance came over and showed me my copy that he'd borrowed via another friend. That's how much people rave about and rely on this book."
2,Catz 5 Not What We Expected,"I recently purchased Catz 5 for my son who is ll. He is a real animal lover and thought it would be right up his alley since he loves Zoo Tycoon. However, we found Catz to be very juvenile for children in this age range. There is not much to do but dress your animals, bathe them, and plant flowers. True you can pet them, play with them, etc., but this is not entertaining for an ll year old. Most of the games, like tic- tac-toe don't work, and the game ends up picking where your X will go. If you want an educational, stimulating game for your child, don't buy Catz, unless your child is under the age of 8. Any child above that age range will be bored within the first half hour."
1,Catz 5 'downgrade',"If you want the software to play with and interact with the Catz, I guess it is okay. However, I purchased Catz 5 primarily for the screensaver (my previous version would not run under Windows XP). Much to my surprise, the screensaver will not run unless the CD is in the CD drive! My two previous versions did not have this requirement. When I contacted UBISOFT by phone regarding this asinine requirement, they refused any consideration of a refund, telling me it was the developers' decision (but of course there is no way I can contact the developers). They blew me off without assistance of any kind! It is my recommendation to not purchase this product 'downgrade'. They do not care about their end-users and do not deserve to have our patronage! I, personally, will never buy another UBISOFT product"
3,very good game (i gusse),"the catz game is one of my favorite, but it could be better. like teach tricks and enter contests. here are the cons.-bad graphics-no challeng-very limited choices-un fun backroundsi got a nintendo ds and got the nintendogs game and its a blastsooooooooooooo fun. get a ds and that game. its worth 200 dollars!!!!!!!!1"
1,I think that this is a copy not the original,"I brought this having lost my original game and I believe I received a knock off copy of the game as it did not have all of the play areas that came with the original. The Game itself is fun but the copy I got was not right at all, the boot up interface was very strange and the packaging looked printed"
3,Puh leeze get something with more fun,"Catz 5 is kinda doppy. You choose catz from like 15 breedz and love em and feed em and care for em. When they are adults, they can breed and care less about you. You get a certificate of happiness. You play with them for two hours and then they get boring. My catz are terrible. They ran away from. I would rather just return this game."
4,Catz 5,"The game its self is good however the ""new and improved"" security system is awful. When ever you turn on your computer you have to install the disk in order to play with your catz. If you do not install the disk and play with your catz they will runaway. Talk about being trapped. I personally do not like having to carry a disk all over just so my catz do not run away from my laptop."
3,"New users, Buy it! Upgraders have another option","If you're new to the world of Petz, by all means go for it. you'll love it. However, it seems that more than a few people have Petz4 and are buying this just because they have Win XP, which theoretically will not run v.4, even in compatability mode. If that's your only reason, there is a software patch available so you can run Petz4 with XP. Just do a web search for Petz and it's easy to find the download."
2,Don't get this game.,"My friend has the Petz 4 game and one day she brought it to my house and I played it. I thought it was fun, so I bought Dogz 5. At first it was really fun! I had a few dogz and the had puppies, but after a while it got really boring. Something would happen and I'd be like ""been there, done that!"" Plus It gave my computer a TERRIBLE virus! It wouldn't let me play any more and every time I turned my computer on the game would start then freeze up my computer! If you want a good game try Zoo Tycoon 2, or NintenDogs!"
2,Catz 4 is a better deal,"I have just purchased Catz 5 and I think it is very low in entertainment. My previous adult cats that I had on Petz 4 I transfered them to Catz 5 but they were all kittens. So I had to wait twice as long to breed them. The toys are also a problem because you have to *earn them by playing stupid little games. The only thing that I liked about this game is that your can have multiple litters. which is great. So if it wasnt for the toys and the transfering of adult cats into Catz 5, I would rate it a 5 star game. I hope Catz 6 will be more improved."
3,The Amazon ratings threw us for a loop,"Our small bible study was looking up the reviews between several choices, and I was amazed to see how many people loved this book and said it made an excellent bible study. We're only 4 chapters into it, so there is a possibility it could change in the next part. However, we are most disappointed that this isn't really a ""bible study,"" - nothing is derived from the bible. The author does a great job with her story-telling, and the mom's input at the beginning of each chapter is fascinating. Perhaps it's because most of us don't come from highly abusive backgrounds. We all knew we have some dysfunction, but not the extreme abuse the author faced. The questions are ok, but they lack some substance, and sometimes are worded in an odd way that makes it hard to answer. This would be good for a book club read, but I wouldn't recommend it for a bible study."
4,Good for pre-counseling,"A great book to pick up if you are thinking about starting counseling to heal from your past. This is a great tool to use with someone holding you accountable for answering the questions and processing how to overcome the past to live a happy today, while being a good mom."
3,Smells like a Grandma?,I personally thought it smelled pretty good but my girlfriend said 'You smell like my Grandma'. Now I smell the grandma in it too.
1,WHAT A BIG RIP OFF !!!,"What a buck of jerks...I ordered the PASSION By Elizabeth Taylor for Men. It was advertised as (1) Cologne Spray 4oz and (2) After Shave 4 oz. as seen here in theirad. I only received the cologne in my order. I wrote to them twice and got an e-mail from some clown named Maxhar Jaffri saying the order was for only the 4 oz cologne and that they were ""not false advertising."" Only problem I have had online in years. Buyer Beware"
3,With Two You Save Water!,"This is a cute Maisy book but honestly not one of our favorites. I can't exactly say why, except that maybe the idea of persistent interruptions to the sanctity of bathtime is the cause.In the story, Maisy prepares for a little bath time fun, only to be interrupted by Tallulah who really wants to play NOW. In, out. Answer the door. In, out. Answer the door. Finally, Tallulah can wait no longer and she rushes in, strips and joins Maisy in the fun.TALKING POINTS:::I think the controversy over this book is pretty funny. But it probably indicates cultural and personal preferences dealing with privacy in the home and bathroom. No real reason to call each other names.For us, we don't take bubble baths because they've been outlawed by our pediatrician. So the book has been as much blessing as curse. Yes, it helped get reluctant toddlers interested in baths; but it also led to calls for bath soaps to which we had to say no.Pam T~mom/bloggerbooksforkids-reviews"
2,Absurd story and we normally love Maisy!!,"This is probably one of the last Maisy books out there that we didn't own and we finally got it, despite a few negative reviews. I now understand those reviews- the story is absolutely silly. Maisy is taking a bath, Talullah comes over and wants to play but Maisy turns her away. Talullah returns because she REALLY wants to play and then runs up to the bathroom, sheds her clothes, hops in the bath with Maisy and they play! I'm not a prude but not only is this not realistic, it's a silly plot. I would not want my daughter's friends to be so insistent that they barge in and jump right into our home, let alone the bath! I found this a major turn off and we seriously love everything Maisy....There could have been so many other great paths this story went down about enjoying bathtime, hygiene, etc."
2,i returned the book,"i returned this maisy book although return shipping cost me more than the book. i was so disappointed i actually didn't care about it. how would you read this book to your valuable one? how could you explain the action of a character forcefully entering your home, taking off her (his) clothes and going in the bathtub with you? i do NOT recommend this particular book."
2,Not for All Maisy Fans,"I got this book for my daughter because she has enjoyed the other Maisy books. The bright colors and graphic drawings seem to really get her attention.However, I was kind of weirded out by the storyline for this one. I am not super conservative or anything but the fact that Maisie answered the door in her towel bothered me. Plus, Maisy answers the door each time, not her mom or dad. Then, her friend runs upstairs and jumps in the tub with her. I just feel like this book wasn't very thought out and may reinforce reckless behavior.I understand the difference between a children's book and real life but the Maisy books' express mission is to teach kids about the world around them and how to behave in it, and I just think this book fails on that point. But we have really enjoyed the other Maisy books and will buy other ones. This one just made me a little uncomfortable."
4,Married an Egineer,"This book, and the whole Maisy series, is engaging. Even my 3 month old nephew pays attention. The primary colors and simple illustrations keep him and my two-year-old daughter engaged for the whole story.The drawback is the paper pages; they don't stand up to a toddler. However, my daughter can't relinquish ""her"" books and doesn't mind tape on the pages."
2,Maisy and her weird pushy friend,"I'm glad we have this on loan from the library, because I plan on returning it tomorrow! My daughter loves it, but she's only 22mos and hopefully isn't picking up on how strange the storyline is. Other reviewers have summed it up, but I won't bother. I can't figure out whether Tallulah is demented or just pushy, but she sure freaks me out. I would rather my daughter learn to say ""Tallulah, I'm busy, so I'll call YOU when I'm ready to play!""."
1,Maisy and her Disturbed Friend,"This is an incredibly weird book. We like almost all the Maisy books, but we do not read this one because it is truly strange and actually kind of disturbing.The storyline is this: Maisy wants to take a bath, but her friend Tallulah keeps ringing the doorbell, wanting to play. The 2nd time Tallulah comes, Maisy arrives at the door, dripping wet in her bath towel. Tallulah brushes past Maisy, takes off her clothes, and jumps in the tub. Happily, the two friends play together in the tub.I couldn't really identify with the characters in this book, nor will I encourage my daughter to identify with them. I know I won't allow my daughter to take naked baths with her friends, even if they are chickens."
4,Holy Sheet!,"The Great:After the first prewash, these sheets were very comfortable.I got my package in 4 days and couldn't be happier.The Not So Great:They are not as bright red as the picture, about 2 shades lower, but certainly a great red color.I did find a few thread rips, not holes just rips, but they are near the foot of the bed so I don't mind so much.My one advice is that you own a lint brush roller because these sheets love lint.All in all I'm very happy about how comfortable they are and how the color just pops."
3,sheets,The sheets are pretty satisfactory. They arrived a few days after I placed the order and resemble the online description. Great rich color and they feel good. My only issue is that after just a month of use a few threads have already been pulled. I noticed the first one after just one sleep. Other than that they are a good purchase.
5,Great sheet,"This sheet is so good, 100% cotton, it is beautiful, I think that I am going to buy a red version too for my sister..."
4,I love red,"I wish these were a better cotton and didn't wrinkle so much but needed the red and we have a Sleep Number split king size bed and this was just what we needed for the bed. The red is a pretty red! I wish the Tommy Hilfiger brand made a blanket in red, too!"
1,Set Had Sheets In Different Sizes,Tommy Hilfiger needs to get its quality control unit together. I purchased this set for a full sized bed but the fitted bottom sheet was for a twin sized bed. I will never order merchandise from this company again.
2,sheet set nantucket,"Tommy Hilfiger Sheet Set, Twin Extra Long, Nantucket Blue. Is was very espensive and i was looking for this products sheets twin"
1,Queen Size Sheet Sets with Standard Pillowcases are just not right,I love Tommy Hilfiger sheets but they come with standard size pillowcases which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to me! Why standard pillowcases for queen size pillows? They don't fit - so I won't be ordering any more TH sheets!We need queen sized pillowcases!
5,new Sheets,"I love my Tommy Hilfiger sheets I purchased thru Amazon.com, however - someone stole my debit card number and tried to take money from my bank account. It was only because I am ever figilant with my account and always checking it and caught the problem before it went thru the acct and my bank was able to stop the transaction. I had to change my password, get a new debit card and go thru a lot of worrying that other transactions had happened that I didn't catch. I worried about using Amazon.com again, so far I haven't - I might, I can't decide/ But I love my sheets."
5,wrong size,"i love the quality of the tommy sheets... although, i hate to admit... but i ordered the wrong size. any way i could exchange them for a full?"
5,Comfortable and fun!,"I'm already a HUGE fan of Tommy Hilfiger Bedding so these sheets were a must-have. After looking through countless online stores and department stores for these sheets in Petal Pink, I finally found them on Amazon for a really good price. These sheets are super comfortable. They wash well and get softer after every wash. I also find the sizes to be true-to-size yet big enough to fit any kind of mattress (including thick ones). I have a set that I've had for over 2 years and they're still as good as new. I LOVE THEM!!!"
2,Terribly disappointing,"I bought these sheets a couple of months ago and initially was very happy at the feel of the fabric, the color and the thread count. But after a few washings (and I'm very meticulous about following washing instructions), I was terribly disappointed at how the color began to quickly fade. The sheets now look as though I've had them for years. I definitely won't be buying these again. This was a total waste of money."
5,super value for awesome product,"I had the hardest time finding this color of sheets for my son's room, but finally found them on Amazon. They were some of the cheapest sets I had found AND designer at that! The quality is great and they wash well. Definitely would buy again."
3,little disappointed,"This is my first and last tommy hilfiger purchase. I always thought of Tommy Hilfiger as being a ""higher end"" product. The color is GREAT. But the quality of the material and the 'texture' is just average. My JCPenney brand sheets are far higher quality and about 1/2 the price."
5,hot pink and fits a thick mattress,"The color isn't a match with the picture here as they are more of a ""hot pink"". They are soft and pretty and fit nicely on thick mattresses."
4,Very wrinkly but relatively soft,"My daughter loves this bright pink. They are extremely wrinkly straight out of the dryer, but I am not the type to iron sheets! The pink in the picture seems a little bit more mellow than the pink in real life, but this was okay with us. Good quality sheets for the price."
2,"Beautiful true color, would like higher thread count","My 16 yo daughter wanted an orange bedroom -- we compromised on orange accents instead and these are just about the only thing we've found in a bright true orange. For my taste, they are not as smooth as I'd like but they are for a 16 yo and she is extremely happy. We washed before use and set color with vinegar to be safe."
2,ok sheets,Tommy Hilfiger sheets are ok but for $50 they should be 800 thread count. I wont buy them again sheets are kinda ruff too
3,The price is right,"These are relatively inexpensive and there are some drawbacks: they're rather thin, they wrinkle easily and there is much material on the sides for thick mattresses. But they wash well and are easy to iron, although not many iron sheets any more."
4,ALMOST PERFECT !,"GOOD QUALITY, NICE COLOR ( I GOT THE BLUE ONE), SOFT, BUT I DID NOT GIVE THE 5 STARS ONLY BECAUSE I HAVE TO USE THE IRON."
3,A little rough,The sheets are a great color and thickness but are a little rough even after washing them. Not sure I love them.
4,Tommy Hilfiger Sheet set.,I purchased these sheets in twin XL for my daughters dorm room and she loves them. The red color is nice and bright. She says they are also very comfortable.
3,"Nice, just not as soft as I had hoped","The color is a little brighter than I expected, but it is nice color if your looking for something bright. I know it's only 200 thread count but, being from Tommy Hilifiger I expected them to be a little softer. I've had 200 thread count sheets that were much better quality than these, but on the other hand I've seen ones that were way worse too. For me these sheets were just okay."
3,Tommy Hilfiger twin sheets,"The sheet itself is of good quality and they are extra long. But, they are shorter in width and barely reach the sides of the mattress to be tucked in. The mattresses are not pillow top or extra thick either. That was the disappointing part.If they were wide enough to be tucked in, they would be a great buy."
1,Too Scratchy,Don't waste your money on these sheets. They are not soft at all. I've washed them once and they are really scratchy. They are for my 4 year old son's bed and the sheets we had for him before from Target that cost half the price of these were much softer. Because I don't feel like mailing these back to Amazon (and not sure I can since I washed them) I am going to go ahead and keep them but we're not using the pillow case. It's just not comfortable at all.
2,"These solid red sheets are a bright, pretty color","I was disappointed at how much these sheets wrinkle in the dryer. I have purchased more reasonably priced bed sheets that were of better quality at half the price of what these were. I bought them because I liked the color, and the red is a very pretty, bright color. I would not recommend buying these unless you like to iron your sheets, or dry them on low heat. The material of the sheets is fairly thin, so I am not sure how long they will last."
1,Definitely not for deep mattresses,"Just bought these Twin XL sheets. Feels fine, but doesn't fit my son's 13-in deep mattress even though it says it should fit a 15-in deep mattress. We had to tightly stretch the fitted sheet on and hope for the best. After a few nights of the fitted sheet pulling off and winding around my son's legs at night, I gave up and bought Royal Velvet 15-in deep sheets from elsewhere. Those are so much more comfortable and fit so much better. No need to stretch the fitted sheets at all!"
5,sheets,"Thanks for the great service and for providing me with a superior product. I am impressed that at a busy time of year service remained out standing, thanks again, peace"
4,Almost perfect,"These sheets are great.They fit snug and wash up well.Not as soft as I would have liked but after the first few washes they wear a bit better.The red is exactly like the photo, nice and bright."
2,OK,"There is some good stuff here in terms of motivating people. Yet, again, as I have found with so many Christian works designed for children and family ministry--its rather shallow. There is little substance here in terms of scholarly or biblical depth."
3,Amateur Hour,"I love Paul Hardcastle's music and have all of his (and the Jazzmaster's) CD's, so I was quite excited about this DVD release, however VISUALLY it is very disappointing. [...]. In an era of CGI and HD TV I thought that the video quality was terrible and that the content was terribly boring and self-indulgent.On a technical note, I would have liked the option of a CD only ""bonus disc"" (this would have helped the other reviewer who couldn't get this DVD to work in a CD player - DOH !!!), as I would have liked to burn the music element of the DVD to my Sonance music server, so that I could listen to the DVD without having to put it into a player each time.So, in conclusion, musically this disc is a 4, visually a 1 (at best).Sorry Paul !!!!"
4,fun little book of children's letters and drawings,"This small book contains 28 children's drawings and 34 short letters to Santa. It is a short and fun book to peruse during the holidays, and would be a cute stocking stuffer. An example:Santa Claus,Last Xmas i asked you for a baby brother.This Xmas i want you to take him back.Love, Susan"
1,Boring!,"I am a avid reader and I read all different genre's. I read almost all the reviews on this book and figured I would give it a try. I am not bothered by Gray Eagle's treatment of Alisha as I get that is what most likely happened during this time period. I don't have a problem with the huge amounts of details about Gray Eagle's way of life. I love reading that in books. My problem with the book is that I find it BORING. I am more then 3/4 of the way through the book and I find myself skimming through page after page after page. I am doing this because I really don't like this author's writing style. I bought the next book in the series, but to be honest I think I am just going to delete it off my Kindle. Just my 2 cents!"
1,Stockholm Syndrome Rape Epic,This novel was one hideous scene of abuse and rape after the next with a sad pathetic heroine who desperately clings to her captor and abuser as some demi-god hero. It was horrible.Also this e-version was replete with typos and poor punctuation. I can only hope it was transcribed through some computer program. Hideous and distracting.
2,Terrible ending,"This book has been sitting on my shelf for years, and out of complete boredom, I finally read it. It is a mediocre book at best. Please...If you think you might want to read it, I have a much better suggestion. Read Ride the Wind by Lucia St. Claire Robison instead."
2,Utterly Weird!!,"I wasn't too sure which way to run with this book. The first few pages of this book were pretty good. Once Alisha was captured the book went for a loop. The worse Gray Eagle treated her the more she loved him. He forced himself on her--she loved him, her uncle and friends were killed by his tribe--she loved him, he smacked her around a few times--she loved him. What was wrong her. I started to find her pathetic. Gray Eagle never listened to any advice because he had to maintain his reputation as a future chief. I could find Gray Eagle's actions acceptable because I could almost visualize an Indian chief acting the way he did but Alisha was a whole other story. Even towards the end of the book when she was at the fort she still pined for him. I think she had mental problems. Also, it seemed like every guy that met her wanted her for one reason or another. I've never read a book with such a weak heroine!!"
3,this is love?,"Maybe I am just not romantic enough, but it seems to me that Alisha is suffering from a really bad case of Stockholm Syndrome: she loves a man who behaves horribly most of the time. For every caress are several scowls. I found her somewhat silly (I love you! I hate you! being screamed within seconds of each other). This series doesn't measure up to Janelle Taylor's Destiny Mine."
2,Do Not Know What To Think,This book is probably more realistic than we would like to think. A girl as young and innocent as Alisha was protrayed as being would have been lost at being taken captive. Her reactions while seeming incomprehensible to us might be close to true for that time period.While Grey Eagle was abusive and cruel to her that was the way that his tribe lived. It would have been totally unrealistic to have portrayed him any other way as most romances do with Native Americans.The ending was realistic. White women who were captives were usually reviled once returned.But I hated the authors style of writing. I found it very repetitive and boring in many places. I will not buy anymore of her books.
3,Savage Ecstasy,"Believe it or not this is the very first romance novel I had ever read. Here it is over 15 years later, and I still love this book. The emotion between Alicia and Gray Eagle is very intense, so is the storyline in this book. I won't give anything away, but this book is not for the faint of heart. Because Alicia is his captive, Grey Eagle is quite brutal, and even cruel at times. If it bothers you to read about the hero getting violent with the heroine, this is not the book for you. The entire Ecstacy series is great, but I liked this book the best. I recommend that if you love Native American romances, you will like this one. Even though this book has a lot of sentimental value to me, I still rate it a three because of the violence Alicia receives from Grey Eagle. Still it is worth the read."
3,"If You Look at it Closely, You can Watch it RUST!!!","Double Boiler works excellent, however the outer pot is a very cheap stailess that rusted the first time I used it. Not really satisfied with it."
1,same problem.... does not work with Terrain twister,"We bought this battery pack since it was the recommended pack for the Terrain Twister, only to find out on Xmas day that the Terrain Twister was a dud because of incorrect battery pack."
1,where's the battery,"i bought the batman tumbler rc for christmas for my 5 year old son. We still are unable to purchace a batttery for this toy, and today is March 7th. maybe next year i can get him a battery for the 60 dollar car that has been decorating the toy shelf all year. When, I wonder, should i expect to be able to get the battery for this ""great toy""?"
1,Advertising Fraud,"I am upset to find that I was sold something that was not needed for the Terrain Twister. The web-page on Amazon.com advertise these products to be bought together to save me money. They said customers also bought this item, making me think this was needed for the Terrain Twister. It was NOT needed nor can it be used with the Terrain Twister vehicle. (...) that I paid for the battery pack/charger and still have to find the right battery to go with the vehicle. This has been a lesson for me NOT to purchase from this company again."
5,Review how the product works - not that it wasn't right for you vehicle,"Whereas it is great info for others to know what this does and doesn't work with, by giving this product a 1-star rating you are saying the PRODUCT is bad/poor, which is not the case."
2,battery,bought it never used it ended up giving it away to someone who was able to use it price was nice ans service was quick
4,A good all-around tea.,"Earl Grey is the quintessential flavoured black tea. Twinings makes a good inexpensive version of this type. This brand was my introduction to earl grey and was my first love when it comes to tea. It has a good tea base without too much bitter or robustness to carry off a delicate, though discernable bergamot flavor. It's classy enough to serve at afternoon tea but not so fancy that you couldn't drink it every day."
1,Fried rice,"An astoundingly arrogant and ridiculous rendering of Lao Tzu's major philosophical treatise - Leary can't be considered a decent poet, let alone capable of apprehending Lao Tzu's awareness from his own purple haze."
3,hmmm....I'm not sure,"The premise of this book is intriguing. A fortune 100 corporate officer has a spiritual encounter causing him to change his life path. I'd like to believe it. There are several unsettling aspects though. He mysteriously leaves out the details for achieving his ""self designed"" ""hybrid meditation technique"" then later offers classes on the subject (for a fee). His spirit guide with the ""highly developed sense of humor"" who fails to say anything even slightly witty. Contrived conversation and his failure to ask obvious questions like ""where's Mom!!"".None the less, Mr. Graybar invested some serious time and thought into the spiritual lessons contained in the book. They are very thought provoking. I am left, unfortunatly, with even more questions at the end."
5,Change your life; read this book.,"I've read many, many books in my life, none that woke me upto the extent this brilliant work did. I'd never heard of Charles Graybar before but frankly, who ever heard of Gary Zukov, Sylvia Browne or the rest of them before they started making all those appearances on Oprah? If you are unsatisfied with your life or feel empty, or, feel that there has been something ""calling to you"" for as long as you can remember -- something that you can't quite put your finger on, read this book. Your eyes and your heart will open and your soul will soar. There's another posting here that talks about waiting for the author's next book and I second that opinion completely!"
5,Really Interesting Book...,"All that I can say about this book is WOW! The book certainly is different. Although I don't agree with all of what the author said, I did get some very valuable insights out of Beyond the Broken Gate. I can understand that some people may feel the book reads as fiction and if one is not comfortable with the ideas the author presents then read it as fiction. It is still an amazing piece of work.The author a former executive using a meditation technique is able to enter another place and is given some really good (at least I feel that many are possible) information on what some of the worlds problems are. Interesting enough the author is now teaching this style of meditation at workshops according his web site.All I can say is have an open mind and you'll certainly get answers to some of the questions that may be troubling you in life."
3,Not too sure,THe book was pretty far fetched but I did try to keep an open mind. I really hope that his experience was real and he isn't a phoney.I guess experiencing it for ONESELF would be the ONLY way to truely believe.The book did get my attention and it WAS a good read.
2,Hard to believe....,"The book started out very interesting but as Graybar got into the ""meat"" of his visions it became too much like fantasy. I wish he would have given a more in depth analysis into what he was experiencing. There are many worthwhile concepts presented but the storyline was too incredulous."
2,Beyond the Broken Gate,"This book seemed contrived and spiritually hollow except for the last chapter, and that was a little wordy. I've gotten more from a one hour AA meeting and it was a lot more believable."
1,Freedom of Religion,That's why I am glad there is one here in America.Everyone is entitled do believe in what or who they choose.After getting as far as chapter 3 I am convinced you can be born again.And as a born again christian I plan to remain that way in Jesus.My reference is john 3:16 NIV1john 5:11
3,"works in new vehicle, not old one","UPDATED A FEW MONTHS LATER:since i have dark interiors on my vehicles, i wanted dark grip pads. this is the only company that sells a bigger sized grip pad that is dark, so i ordered several packs.the pads work in my 2012 nissan senta, but not the old toyota pick-up.my first review said they didn't work at all in either car, but they have been working in the new car."
1,Waste of money,"The things wouldn't even stick to the dashboard, so how are ""items"" supposed to stay on it? Everything ended up in the floor.Greatly disappointed."
1,Dont buyt it,completely useless. I bought it to put on the dash of my vehicles to keep my radar detector from moving around...one vehicle is a Ford F150 supercrew with the indentation in the top of the dash..I cut it to fit and placed it inside..after just 2 mile the detector was all over the place...2nd vehicle is a Camry....it wouldnt even stay on top pf the dash with NOTHING on it...no stickynest to it at all...waste of money
4,Sticky,"It's been on my dash for a year now. It's a good size. I use it for my sun glasses and my remote door opener, not much else"
1,Does not work at all,"This product does not work, it does not stick at all, either side. I would not suggest buying this product."
3,Non-slip dash grip mat,"Does not stay on dash the grip does not seem to hold, size is nice. Probably wouldn't recommend to a friend."
5,It was what I was looking for,"Simple, this product does exactly what I expected. Actually I got two pads instead of one, so it what nice"
3,I've seen better.,"Good size mat and the price was very good, but I have seen tackier surfaces. We'll see how it holds up in FL sunlight."
4,"Good value, does the job",Bought this to put in my truck on dashboard where I like to place my phone or MP3 players so they don't fall and it works fine for that.
3,Not as nice as I expected,"I thought that this would solve my sunglasses sliding across the dash. It does that, sort of, but they are very easy to move on the dash. Also, one of the pads in the package had a defect in the middle, so it didn't look pristine. For the price that they charge it isn't worth turning them."
5,Great guidelines to design by and LARE review material,"I actually had the honor of taking serveral of classes with Prof. Booth while getting my landscape architecture degree. Basic Elements of Landscape Architectural Design is very straight forward and easy to understand. The book is appropriately titled containing all of the basic elements of design in this profession from landforms, spatial definition, plant material uses, and water to the design process. This book helped me pass section B of the LARE (Landscape Architectural Registration Exam) and I have continued to keep it on hand as a reference."
5,Great Filter with great results and great for the pocketbook,"Hi All,Please see my write up on the FAP00-RS for details. The FAP003 is the big brother. These filters come with a multi pack discount from Amazon. The cost breaks down to $15 for 90 days of use or $5 per month. This is the best deal on the planet. I have multiple FAP003 units in my house and it does a fabulous job with Hepa results at a fraction of the cost. This is a great system: great for your health and pocketbook!Thank you.Blessings,Phil"
5,my only air cleaner,I will only buy this type of air cleaner and filter. They are great. I am saddened that the filters are so expensive...we go through so many. I am thankful I can get them thru this seller on Amazon as they are amuch better deal and come quickly. : )
4,Does what it's supposed to.,Does what it's supposed to--fits and works in Filtrete air purifier that retailers don't generally carry prefilter for.
4,Up Close and Focused,"Three good attributes of this lens: excellent quality rapid auto focus and low f/#. An annoying characteristic of this lens to me is its large size. That requires a separate case for it if one uses a standard camera bag with other lenses. At high magnifications, good photos require no camera movement and precise focusing on subjects. I highly recommend using a tripod with this lens and focus on still subjects whenever possible. I've taken many excellent photos at long distances with this lens on my Sony Alpha 700 camera."
4,Use this book for creating a business plan,I purchased this book for the intent of helping me write a business plan. The book is quite useful for the purpose of starting a physical therapy business. It contains helpful service benchmarks and loads of patient forms and examples of important documents needed in preparing your business plan. I would not recommend the book if you're interested in management tips; it is geared primarily for start-ups or new businesses. Very well written and easy to understand.
2,authors motive??,"Since I had recently opened my own practice, I thought the book would give insight on where to market and some tools needed for marketing and just tips on how to efficiently run an outpatient clinic. I found this book to be not so helpful,it seemed as if the author wanted to steer anyone away from having their own practice and a lot of the reading was very vague, so... purchase at your own risk"
1,too confusing,the thing consists of two parts...i was trying to put it together for few days...then my hubby was making fun of me...I asked him to assemble the thing...he is an Engineer and he spend half of the day truing to figure out how to put this two together...anyways eventually it did not fit my Singer....
3,"Works, but could use improvements","I have an old Singer, the Fashion Mate 360 from the 1960s. It was hard for me to determine if this would fit my machine when buying online. When it arrived, it took me at least a half an hour to figure out how to attach it, and I'm pretty bright with machinery. It would have been nice to have instructions on the back of the package. The range of adjustability is rather narrow. I only sewed one zipper with this foot, and it came out OK. I will have to practice some more to give a better review."
5,Hot new Indie Sydney band,"This is their second EP and it is great. You can experience their vibe most any week at a Sydney pub. All their songs are orginals written by their front man, Billy Coleman. The sound is terrific and if you really listen to the lyrics, you will be moved. His songs definately make my heart sing! But don't believe me, get this and find out for yourself why more people every week are calling into the Sydney radio stations to hear them over and over again."
4,Yummy,"Tiny like angel hair pasta. Great taste. Goes well with steamed veggies, meats, fried egg, etc. These noodles expand ALOT (one of the four nuggets in each bag could feed 2). What else do you need to know?"
2,Poor audio video with good racing.,"This DVD is everything of the Isle of Man coverage you see on TV AND NOTHING MORE. TV quality video and sub-par sound. The racing is great but the audio/video was a major disappointment (No Dolby or DTS encoding, not even 2.0)."
5,A must have.,This video is a must have for anyone into motorcycles.The on board camera footage is amazing. I've watchedDJ's practice lap of the island ( ~18 minute loop ) at least20 times. Unbelievable.I can't wait for the 2003 review to come out!
3,Fair,This battery and charger are a fair product but not great. It is true though the battery last longer that a normal one would. But I do not think that makes it or should make it double the price or a normal battery.
1,My son needs a battery.,"I purchased my son the spider-man car for Christmas and I haven't been able to get a battery for his car yet. I even tried one from Radio shack , but it didn't work. I do not believe it is very good business to sell a toy that can't be played with because the battery is not available. Very dissapointed in the unavailablity of this product."
1,toys that are of no use!!!!,"If a company is going to stop manufacturing a battery, then they should pull the corresponding toys they power off the shelves so that little kids are not disappointed when their really cool looking remote control cars will never work...No wonder tyco has so many problems..."
1,Christmas - One year later,"I wish I had read these reviews before I went out and bought the TYCO ""Rebound"" remote control car for my sons Christmas present. Now I can't find the battery charger anywhere and my son will be returning to his mothers without ever even playing with his Christmas gift -- (WON'T WORK WITHOUT A BATTERY!!!).I'm really angry about this and am very disappointed with TYCO."
3,Who were the rulers of....,"This is a good book for finding the main rulers of a particular part of the world, at varying times. He also briefly denotes some family ties in this book. He also attempts to help the reader locate many of the early kingdoms of the world by today's map. He gives a little history on each country or province listed as well.Unfortunately, in some parts of the world, only a few rulers are listed, in varying time frames. The only time a queen (or female counterpart) is listed is if she ruled under that title in her own right, which I find annoying, as you have problems finding the queens of a lot of the kings of the world, because no lists that I could find, have been made of them, as with the kings. I wish he would have listed inline sources where he found his information on each section. I'm sure space was limited due to publication costs, and I've been told there are a few mistakes in the work, but all in all, it's a good resource book."
2,Good but very pricey,"I bought this just to try something new. I love peach and mango flavors, and this sounded very good. I do think it's a good drink, but whether or not I am able to think better because of it is up for debate. I doubt I'll buy these again if only because they are quite pricey. 12 small cans (the liquid volume is only a smidgeon over one cup) for over twenty dollars? It's close enough to $2 a can to make it not cost effective to get vitamins and minerals this way. The taste is good, but I have had lots of other healthy drinks that taste just as good for less than a third of the cost. But now I know, this drink is not for me. If you like good-tasting nutritious drinks that cost a LOT of money, this one's for you!"
3,"Not bad, not great...","At $18 with free (Prime) shipping, these are much cheaper than Red Bull, etc. They also don't pack the same punch, but they seem to be healthy and they do help in the morning routing. The taste is okay, seems to have a weird aftertaste. Goes nicely with Vodka (can I say that?). I won't order this flavor again, but I am trying some of the others..."
5,A Powerful and Deep Insight into a Universal Spirituality,"This is a beautifully written book, in poetic language, describing what the author calls the magnificence of the ""Mercy of God"" i.e. the place of Mystical Hope, that lies beyond all our petty, little hopes--a place accessible to all of us: ""Deeper than our sense of isolation and separateness is another level of awareness in us, another way of knowing."" My one criticism of the book was that it did not develop more fully the theme of mystical hope, as applied, for example, to those living with incurable illness, or in hospice. It seemed, rather, to just toss out the idea, and then jump into the [albeit] wonderful descriptions and details of meditation. Nevertheless, this is a five star book!"
4,A good album for fans of disco/funk.,"If you're a fan of BT Express, Brass Construction, Fatback Band, the JBs, KC & the Sunshine Band, etc., then you'll like this CD. The sound is more electronic than the 70's bands mentioned above, but it's good to know that good funky dance music is still being put out. Another good choice is the CFM band on Instinct Records, for some hard core acid-jazz funk."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME--OR MONEY-YOU CAN HAVE MINE,"this is one of those books you read while waiting in the grocery store check out line--that much time may even be too much time-to read this entire little, foolish book! There is no wit, thought or style to this little waste of paper! I was taken, hook line and sinker by this stinker! Not what I thought it was going to be--it is a book of one page lists of ""rationalizations"" or excuses like--Rationalizations for Getting Pregnant--Time off from work! Har Har Har! It is all on this low level--so ill prepared, goofy one liners without the punch of a good one liner! Sad, very very sad! Thanks for showing me that there is indeed a fool born every minute--the last minute was mine--don't let the next one have your name on it! If someone wants this--contact me--FREE!"
5,One of the best,"I've read almost every book on stocks and this is one of the best. It pulls together the finest advice written about stock investing and translates it into memorable language. Kelly's ramp-up system that takes the novice from mutual funds to large cap Dow stocks to small cap growth stocks is smart. He shows the wisdom of Warren Buffett alongside the practical observations of Peter Lynch. Rather than take sides in the age old value vs. growth debate, Mr. Kelly shows how the two systems work best together. Perhaps most importantly, the book shows that it is vital for every investor to understand his or her companies thoroughly. Only then can you make an educated decision whether to buy more when the price dips. Read this book, folks. It is one of the best."
5,Best book for begginers,If you are new to trading then this book will help you ALLOT but if you have all the basic knowlege then this will not be very helpfull.
5,BUY THIS BOOK!,"There are not enough positive adjectives to describe this book. This is the most concise, clearly written book on investing in stocks that you will ever find. Mr. Kelly's writing style is exceptional. (I agree with the person who said ""no fluff"") He writes in a nonpretensious, honest way and shares EVERYTHING he has learned with the reader. This is the most well rounded, book I have read to date. I now have the confidence to invest wisely. Please, do yourself a favor...buy this book!"
1,Neatest little guide in Stock Market,this little Book is sound and well written but it horribly out of date.
1,"please dont be fooled by these ""reviews""","look, if you want to know the value of this book, look at the performance of the so called strategy (double the dow). it boils down to this: uh, buy this one mutual fund i know about (UDPIX). which in theory would double the average return of the dow, and it does, for 3 year period selectively assigned by the author. unfortunately for him, if actually owns it, and you if you buy it, it underperformed the dow and the s&p for total 4 year period since its inception by nearly 15%. the book is crap."
5,A Very Complete Book For The Beginning Investor,"A complete book which shows you how to evaluate stocks, how the legendary investors like Graham, Lynch and Buffett invest, how to read the financial pages and reports to get the important ratios for comparing stocks. This book also give you good publications and good Internet resources. A beginner can save a lot of time (and money!!!) by reading just this one book."
4,"Entertaining, quirky immigrant comedy","""Yana's Friends"" is a light movie about a young pregnant Russian woman left alone in Israel by her husband, with only her philandering roommate and rude landlady to watch over her. The exploits of poor Russian immigrant are humorized, with the Gulf War as an often-comic backdrop. The film never loses its charm; the characters are always entertaining. Although funnier if you speak Russian, anyone can enjoy a sweet movie like this one."
5,Only Russians can understand....,"I cried...I do not understand why it is called a ""comedy"". You feel ashamed, confused, angry, and so sorry for the miserable life of those people and for all that global unhappiness and inability to change anything... and at the same time feel so blessed that you are not there... Only people who went through the nightmare of early 90s in Russia can understand this drama, those who desperately tried to find any corner on the Earth except their homeland, even getting there where you wear gas masks every night in a cheap, miserable, smelly, hot, old apartment somewhere where nobody wants you..."
4,Excellent Reference,"I needed a reference guide for Quicken 2004. After purchasing the Dummies version, this book is by far the better text. It provides clear, concise information with screen shots for all aspects of Quicken 2004 including items you may not know about. (Records Organizer Household Organizer!) Those were not mentioned in the other text. She gives suggestions for how to set up your files the way that you want. I highly recommend this book whether you are an expert or just beginning. It is well worth the price!"
5,black cards rock,"These are just lovely- I bought them to use together with a black spider deck and the combination of the black and white and red from both decks is just what I was looking for. A bit goth and sci-fi and geek. Unique and interesting, but still usable fun cards. Mostly I play a version of rummy with my family, but sometimes a bit of solitaire or card houses. Just pretty entertainment. I don't plan on using them for magic, as I think they were meant to be. But I think they would work well for that. They are very durable and slick, but don't show fingerprints easily. I'm happy with this purchase!"
4,Black Tiger Bite,"The Bicycle Black Tiger deck was originally intended for the avid magician. It includes a regular deck of playing cards (54 cards including jokers) with an unusual color design. The face of the card obviously is black, and the white design of the pips, faces, and suits really makes this deck look awesome(especially under a black light). Great for any collector, magician, or regular game play, these cards are very high quality, and could add excitement to a Holloweeen card night."
3,Not as shown in picture,"I wanted so much to love these cards. They look very cool and I do really like them, however, one thing I am disappointed about is the picture shows the Jack of Diamonds with the J and diamonds filled in with red...like the suit is supposed to be. But the actual cards do not have any red anywhere on the card. This does add to the coolness of the cards since they are all black/white, but several of the people I have played cards with do not like these cards because it is harder to recognize the difference between suits without seeing them as red or black. This is just something to consider when purchasing these cards, otherwise if you can get past that, these are cool cards."
3,Okay.,Got this for my son. He use it for a little bit. Now he doesn't even play with it at all. I guess he got bored with it.
5,christmas pine great,i needed a really great swag for above the bay window this was so great i have had comments on it people wondering where i got it thanks great gift for me
2,I got it for Wu Wear...,"And that's it. I like ""Wu Wear: Garment Renaissance"" and ""The Good, The Bad, The Desolate"" by The Roots but that is all I like. This soundtrack is symbolic of a time when people would just gather a bunch of names to record music that really had no relation to the movie or didn't jibe well with the movie to which it was attach (Death Row Records was famous for this). The end result is the proverbial ""throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and see what sticks"". Those two songs are the only ones that stuck as far as I was concerned. If it is indeed only $.70 here, that is about all it is worth: you'd be better off using your 70 cents on the download or a box of Boston Baked Beans."
2,No No No,"This is one of those compliation discs that offer a lot of big names, but little substance. There are some quality moments on this disc provided by D'Angelo & Erykah Badu (""Precious Love"") but that's about it. Do not buy this CD unless you're a diehard fan of one of the artists on this soundtrack or unless you're dellusional."
1,we get it already,"If you wish to learn something interesting re the fact that the keys of b minor and Bb major share the note D as their third, you would do far better to consult a decent recording of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata than this navel-gazing narcissistic atrocity."
4,Very good Jarrett improvisation.,"I have several recordings of Jarrett's which include: Koln, Bremen/Lausanne, Vienna, Dark Intervals, Facing You, Tokyo '84 DVD.However I don't find myself going back to the Paris concert as often as the first three I listed. The main reason is the Paris concert has one of his longest running episodes of droning away on one chord.In the final analysis though this is excellent music. It has some of his most superb Baroque-style improvisation of any of his recordings, which in and of itself is a great reason to purchase this album. I mean how many artists out there even ATTEMPT to improvise Bach like stuff? Its really cool."
1,Inhumane,Why shock your dog into a stay on a mat when you can easily teach him to enjoy being there with a Kong!
5,Yassboy,"Human Nature were very good before but now have become much more professional since their time in the States, and time with Smokey Robinson. This DVD is most enjoyable, and congratulations are in order for such a polished performance."
5,A MARVELLOUS SURPRISE.,"BONJOUR, je suis franais et j'aime ""the motown sound"".C'est par hasard que j'ai découvert ce dvd, et surtout le groupe HUMAN NATURE qui a un talent formidable, et des voix incroyables. En les écoutant, on plonge dans les grandes années de la MOTOWN, et dans ces succés qui aujourd'hui encore nous font danser et chanter.BRAVO HUMAN NATURE!!! Je vous recommande à toutes et à tous ce fantastique dvd spectacle de HUMAN NATURE."
5,Great Video,Saw these guys twice in Vegas and they were great and upbeat. They were at the Imperial Palace but moving to the Venetian next year where I believe this was filmed.
5,Like being there in person,"We recently saw Human Nature in person in LV. This DVD is absolutely outstanding, the group is outstanding, the music perfect renditions of the original Motown music."
4,How good is it? You just gotta listen..,"So you thought R Kelly was the master crooner or sexaholic spit some mad game on his albums? Think again. Back in 95 these not so well known fellas came out with some hot *stuff* that would wet even the hardest woman to please. It's a shame they only came out with two albums (No honey, no money being the first and Forbidden Vibe being the 2nd) cause they can sure make some great Rnb for that special occasion. You'll dig tracks like Twisted, Under My Spell and Did you Love me?..for the ladies..no fear Mr. Go Down is the one for you! Damn...they couldn't have done it better, it's sad we only got to see this last album with them together (RC the lead singer came out with Dre in his Welcome to the Aftermath cd which didn't sell much but..) Get this one if you like this kind of Rnb or something to get the mood started. 4 stars."

1,Didn't fit my bully well at all,It fit him in all the wrong places... Material was really cheap... He wore it for a minute and begged to be free of it.
1,ehh,"its nothing more then a piece of cheap thin fabric. i know its just a dog costume, but for the price, i expected a lot more then just a sheet. i ordered mine way too big (i have a 50lb pitbull-whos very hard to shop for cuz of her chest) The thing that holds it together is velcrow-one around the neck and one around the belly-the belly one was way too large, and the chest one was way to tight. but she looked very cute (i tied the belly one in a knot) with utters. the hood didnt stay on either. overall, it sucked, but it was hilarious to see her in it! ---oh and it rips really easy----"
1,Waste of Money,This by no means looks like a pig on our bulldog.Better for a kid when they get out of the shower.Save the money
1,Don't waste your money,"It's adorable, but it doesn't stay on at all. The tiny velcro strips are worthless. It stayed on all of 30 seconds, and my dog isn't even rambunctious."
4,Jewish Passages,"""Jewish Passages"" is rather dry reading. That is not helped by the choice of graphics - tight, thin lettering.I bought the book to accompany a course on the subject. So far, have not used the book a lot but I may later on."
4,A saint?,"About two women who struggle to find their own religious identities and ideals (and clash in the course), this book opens up all kinds of questions about religion, faith and piety. It's an interesting documentary on the religious conflicts of the times and people's needs to find someone or something to believe in. Being about actual people made it all the more interesting, but I can't say that I believe either of these two women did anything to deserve the title of Saint. Reads alittle like nonfiction at times, but is still an easy, quick and enjoyable book."
5,The Boy Colonel,"I am a direct descendent of Henry King Burgwyn Jr, with the exact same last name. I know all about my great great uncle and this book is a very good describer of him, his family, and life and times. I have lent this book too many Civil War buffs and it always comes back with a raving review.BUY IT!!!"
3,Boy Colonel of the 26th North Carolina Infantry,"This biography of Henry Burgwyn Jr, who was killed at Gettysburg, is well-researched and easy to read. You emerge with a good understanding of Burgwyn, and his family, and get insights into the life of a serving junior officer in the Confederate Army. It also provides some insight into North Carolina society at the time of the Civil War. I read it after reading Rod Gragg's ""Covered with Glory"", the story of the 26th North Carolina Infantry at the battle of Gettysburg, which I would highly recommend."
5,"attractive, and hice. Would be nice if could change cord.","This is a fine cross, attractive and nice. Although, it would be nice if one could change the black ""cord"" for a chain. This is a minor issue and provides excellent value for money, and as a testament to one's faith, worth it."
3,Choco gets his due,"The main emphasis in this book is on Alfredo ""Chocolate"" Armenteros. Davies also looks at the work of Chappottin, but to a lesser degree. The best part of the book for a layperson is the interview with Chocolate included in the appendix. The interview is in Spanish, with an English translation. This book is especially good for music students interested in the Cuban trumpet style. There is practically nothing, however, on two other significant Cuban trumpeters, El Negro Vivar and Jorge Varona. Still, this is a minor quibble. Davies had done a great service to all of us who love Cuban music, and also to the underdocumented Chocolate Armenteros."
1,0 stars,"Disappointed. This book is worthless. The author should not try to write a book while smoking dope. The first half of the book is a Mac-is-great commercial. The last half of the book is a Mac-is-great commercial. Yes, I know the Mac-is-great, I love the Mac, Macs are cool, Macs are usefull, rah rah rah. Unfortunately, the book is content free. No actual developers were involved in the production of this book; no actual developers were informed by reading this book."
1,this weak book betrays it's title,"As a C developer of Mac & Win software, I bought this book hoping it would be of some help for porting an existing MacOS application (written in C) to Carbon/Mach-O.This book is worthless for C/C++ developers.This book is biased toward new projects written in Objective-C & the Cocoa framework. It ignores C, pushing the objective-c language instead.The first 100 pages deal with topics as worthless as ""what is a programmer"" and ""the history of the mac os"" ... Who cares? Teach me about the Event Manager and Quickdraw vs. Quartz. Did you know that this book makes NO mention of Quartz and only has one page number listed for ""Darwin"" (pg 141).I've already returned it and I'm now looking for something else."
2,"A 580 page overview, A Developers Introduction","I may be the wrong person to write a review on this book. As an OS X developer, much of the info in this book can be found in Apple's website, in Apple's (free) technical documentation, and at WWDC.A ""Developer's Introduction"" is a better title for this book.If your brand spanking fresh to OS X (where have you been?), buy the book!Otherwise, consider ""Carbon Programming""..that book doesn't mess around."
1,I can't see a target audience,"Lots of paper, but not much information. Many things are scrated on the surface, but not in a way you can really use something. As an experienced developer on other plattforms (Java,--ix) I wanted an overview of the OS and the API's. The book failed here totally. I think I got 2 usefull snippets of information from the first 300 pages, when I decided its a waste of time, to go on. And additionally some Java-examples are close to wrong (the reflection example)."
1,Useless,"This book was one of the first on the market for OS X programming. I believe that's the only reason anyone would buy it. The explanations are uninformative - basically saying the obvious and referring the reader to the Apple documentation. (You'd be better off just directly reading the free Apple documentation available online)For an example of what to expect from this book take the following stunning revelation (page 307) - a discussion on Help Viewer - ""Users click on buttons; they move scroll bars; they have been trained to interact with the interface."" I'm glad we cleared that up. These platitudes continue throughout.Examples are given in both Java and Objective C - this adds nothing since the Java classes are just wrappers around the Objective C classes. All these examples show is how to do the same thing twice in a slightly different syntax.Do yourself a favor and buy ""Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X"" by Aaron Hillegass."
2,Drum is junk!,"My son reieved this tumbler as a birthday gift in November. Just finished the first round of rocks and the drum has a hole in it...... I could see after time the plastic drum wearing thin, but this was the first set of rocks! I would not recommend buying this product!"
1,This product is not what you are expecting!,"After following the instructions carefully, my rocks came out of the tumbler looking dull and without a hint of shine. The rocks were smooth but didn't look at all like the misleading pictures seen on the package and advertisements. I could have accomplished the same thing by walking two blocks away and picking up a handful of pebbles in a running brook!"
1,rock tumbler,"Product is way too loud. Can't keep it in the house, we had to put in the shop. I would not recommend becouse of the noise levels."
4,A Little Patience Never Hurt Anyone!,"My 8 yr. old daughter bought this item herself and loves it! She understood from the beginning that it would take a long time since it was doing nature's job of ""thousands of years"" in just one month. In a world of toys that offer instant gratification for our youth, this one teaches them that nature just doesn't work that way! Yes, it's noisy (we put ours under a styrofoam cooler & put a rock on top & that helped A LOT), yes, it's takes time, and yes, it is a bit messy, but look what you get in the end. Through all three steps, your child (and probably you too) learn the process and see how nature can turn a seemingly ugly rock into a beautiful gem. If you don't like noise, waiting or a little mess, this isn't for you. If you do like cause and effect, you will love this product. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day!!..."
1,Couldn't use...too loud,"We bought this for my son who loves rocks, however, it sounded like a washing machine off balance. We could hear it running from any room in our townhome. We were not aware when we bought it that it had to run for 4 days. We couldn't live with the sound for more than a few hours. It probably would be alright if you have a workshop or someplace like that to run it. We never got to see a finished product because of the sound and length of time it needs to run."
1,The Daily Grind,"While I am looking forward to seeing the polished rocks at the end (we're at day 9), I am irritated at the amount of time it takes. The constant droning, crunchy sound filters up two floors of our house (it's in the basement). My son was disappointed that he would have to wait that long. The time should have been stated on the box so I could have evaluated whether or not we had the patience for it. I read a review on another website that said it took ""mere minutes"" from start to end. That's deceptive. It's also fairly non-interactive (except for the constant noise) and very messy (while I was changing it, the sludge almost ruined a pair of shoes). I hope this is worth it."
2,How can i be happy with a burnt out motor...,Not to happy at all. Daughter was all excited to open her new Christmas gift only to find out it had a bad motor and didn't work properly. How am I suppose to tell her that Santa didn't make it right. If you could of only seen the sad look on her face...
2,Not worth it,"It's cheaply made (the cylinder is plastic), the motor makes a lot of noise (I can hear it two floors away), and it leaks. Not nearly worth the price."
1,Wait For Ever!,"This ""toy"" polishes rocks. It's a wonderful idea, however, they fail to mention on the box you have to leave this thing running for more than 3 WEEKS! No child has that much patience!"
3,so-so,"the lid did not fit snugly, so it leaks unless everything is just perfect. Solved by putting a piece of plastic wrap under the lid before attaching. Motor is a bit loud. Would have been nice to have a couple of extra sets of polishing supplies provided so didn't have to re-order immediately. But in the end, it works."
2,ramblin about a tumbler,"well, this is my first rock tumbler and i realize it isnt a professional model-i couldn't afford one. the problems i have with it are fairly simple and straight forward. the drum leaks quite alot, even if you follow the very limited instructions...i dont know about the final polishing stage, either. if you expect rocks that look like the ones you can buy at museums and such, you will be disappointed. i have heard that crushed walnut shells could do the trick, but of course they dont come with the kit. you only get one set of each-heavy grit, medium grit, and polish. you have to order refills(if you want to use the same brand, unless you are lucky enough to have a hobby shop that carry this brand) the prices do not seem to bad to me, but honestly i have yet to shop around much. it is a decent, but loud and messy product. good for a first time tumbler, i guess. good luck and happy tumblin'."
