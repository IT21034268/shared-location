5,A Hard Day's Night,"I know a lot of people are saying that the quality of things on this DVD are very bad compared to other versions. But I've never seen another version, and if you haven't either than it won't make a difference to you.This movie is just terrific. The Fab Four seem to really be enjoying themselves. It's a hilarious movie, with Paul's grandfather and John making most of the laughs. The performances of songs are very good. It's a great movie, and it actually has a plot (unlike Magical Mystery Tour).This film is a must for any Beatles fan, buy it now!!!"
4,Good even if you dont like the Beatles,"I don't really like the Beatles music but this is actually a pretty good movie, very funny and quotalbe and they were natural actors. And if you don't care too much for their music, just skip all of the musical scenes except for Can't Buy Me Love, which is a great scene with them playing and running around in a field."
4,DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR A NEW EDITION! ENJOY THIS DVD SET!,"This DVD set has taken a lot of trashing! The aspect ratio isn't correct on the DVD but, the cropping is not all that bad! I did find that during the many musical numbers the bass was booming way too much through my sub and I had to adjust it quite a bit. The film itself is a classic and anyone growing up with it will fondly rememeber how magical these guy were. A groovy Marx Brothers romp through the early 60's with some of my favorite Beatles songs laced throughout the random comedic elements. Maybe they will make purist happy one day and release this in the correct format but, I'm not holding my breath. I say, if your a fan stop crying and start enjoying this wonderful film, even if it isn't the definitive release of this film on DVD. The transfer is excellent and there are some interesting extras."
1,Never felt so ripped off ....,"Was looking forward to the DVD release - and low and behold a huge step backward compared to the MPI release. Maybe they did clean up the sound a bit - but that 'plus' is completely ruined by the poor print they used for this DVD. The MPI release was MUCH better, and I'm certainly holding on to mine. Thus learneth the lesson on marketing that promotes ""new and improved"" - especially from Miramax."
4,For the young at heart,"I first saw this when I was 11 (in 1975) and went through my own phase of Bay-tel mania as a result. The music is fresh and clean and the Fab 4 are quite appealing. The interview is a scream! (""What do you call your hairstyle?"" answer-""Arthur.""). Ringo's forlorn walk through the streets to the tune of ""This Boy"" made this tune run through my head everytime I took a solitary walk for years. The shabby teen show host who tries unsuccessfully to exploit George Harrison rings all too true even today (one can picture this guy as an MTV-American Idol excec). The ""clean old man"" gives the picture added dimension.However, today's kids might be baffled by the whole thing, and the Fab 4's thick accents require repeated viewing for most people. But it does seem to appeal to the kid in a lot of people with the Bay-tels' freewheeling attitudes and the excitement surrounding their music. Sort of explains the whole phenomenon of Bay-tel mania."
5,Great Film,"If you've never seen the first Beatles film, then now is the time to treat yourself to a real feast! This film is a classic for so many reasons, but the most important in the genuine humor and natural innocence of the early Beatles. All of the songs are wonderful, and it is a joy to see John, Paul, George, and Ringo running around having so much fun."
3,Good but Small,"This CD-ROM for the Mac came out in the days before DVD and so pales in comparison with a DVD movie. The entire movie is here, with commentary, out-takes, still pictures and more. The biggest drawback is the smallness of the window the movie is shown in--it can't be enlarged, so you're stuck watching a Pocket TV-sized screen. Overall, this CD-ROM is a good bit of nostalgia, but I'm sure a DVD version would be much much better and do the Beatles more justice."
3,could have been better,"Seen martin lewis (one of the guys behind the making of this d.v.d.)in Chicago in August and he said since the Beatles company ""Apple"" does not own this film, the beatles will have nothing to do with it. That is why there are no new interviews with paul and ringo.Also, i think if Apple would have been involved, i don't think we would be seeing so many negative reviews. Look what Apple did with the Yellow Submarine D.V.D.Excellent 5.1 sound mxed at abbey road studios. The picture quality on the hard days night d.v.d. is all i can say that they did right. Please, Miramax, this is the Beatles.Hopefully, since this is a ""special edition"", they can right their wrongs. But i'm not holding my breath. Bummer, because this d.v.d could have been so much better. I give the movie itself a 5, the d.v.d. a 2."
5,"Delightful, funny, entertaining!","I bought this movie on DVD because my 21 year old son who enjoys the Beatles music wanted to see it. I had seen it when it first came out in theaters and thought it would be fun to see it again. This movie holds up so well. It is still as fun to watch as it was 40 years ago. The Beatles shine through as funny, engaging entertainers. You get to see a bit of their personalities as they are not playing ""characters"" but themselves. It is done as a mock ""documentary"" in a typical day in their lives but it is light and fun to watch. Their musical performances are great and you get a glimpse of George Harrison's future wife Pattie Boyd as one of the school girls on the train. John and Ringo are particular stand outs in this movie but George also has some fun scenes. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to see why Beatlemania existed. Classic entertainment!"
3,Quality Time with the Fab Four,"I just watched A hard Day's Night on DVD. The quality of the sound and video are average at best. It is still the Beatles; however, and any time with the Beatles is quality time. This movie was fun because of the interaction between the band members and the silliness of John. This is required viewing for a Beatles fan. There is little here for non-Beatles fans. The music is still as wonderful as ever, I just expected the sound to be much better. I was disappointed in the extras, or lack thereof. This was a three star viewing experience... not bad but not what it could have been."
3,not exactly what was expected,"Perhaps my expectations for this dvd was a bit too high, but it wasn;t all that I had hoped for. I enjoyed the packaging ad certain features, but it jsut didn't seem complete."
3,Such a clean old man!,"A Hard Day's Night is a good, upbeat movie about a day in the life of the Beatles. There isn't much plot-wise; it's really meant more as a comedy. The movie opens with the Beatles running away from their crazy fans and getting onto a train. Paul's grandfather is with them, as well as their two managers. They ride the train to a hotel, where they stay for a while, then go to a studio, where they're filming live on TV.It has a lot of British humor in it-basically one-liners and clever dialogue, but nothing really slapstick. It was funny, but only a few scenes really made me laugh out loud.The cinematography in the movie is really great. The acting was fair-not outstanding, but not horrible either. A Hard Day's Night is a funny comedy worth watching once or twice. In the end though, it's only slightly better than average."
5,A Hard days Night,wow! What a movie. I was 20 in 61 and remember the excitement the Beattles created; This movie is a good recall of those super times.Even George's Grandfather was good.
5,classic,"very good beatles dvd. i don't know why some reviewers say the sound quality is bad, my dvd was perfect. the extras were a nice touch, to bad we didn't here from paul or ringo."
4,Beatles - Hard Days Night (2 Discs) new release,"I've been waiting for some time for this. Read a review that said, it was the best B&W movie one could own. At the time it was out of print. Well, it was worth the wait. The picture is suberb, the story still fresh and funny and the music, oh the music. The Beatles music is timeless and this DD presentation is the best I've heard, although not up to today's 6.1 surround standards, it is 250% better than the original sound track, I'm sure! In 1964, my wife waited, at 20 below zero in a line-up to see this (I can't remeber that far back, although I saw it then too). If you love the Beatles, get this, you won't be sorry."
5,Pop Fan from Hollywood...,"...gets 10 stars for sarcasm. That is the funniest thing I have seen here yet. As for AHDN, it is still as charming, clever, and amusing as it was when I first saw it. The music still holds up as well of course. Only problem is, you really have to listen carefully at times to understand what the Fabs are saying underneath the layers of ""scouse."" Almost as hard as understanding the kids in ""Quadrophenia"" at times."
4,The film that foresaw the video clip!,"In many ways, I don' t think to sound exaggerate to affirm it. A day in the lives of these emblematic integrants of the most famous Band in the history, perhaps under the perspective of more than forty years elapsed, it may be seen as a naf picture if you want, but you should turn back the needles of the watch and to set in the right moment; perhaps the most important aspect to remark is that it allowed to establish the first possibility of expression backstage, that eventually would open the gates for future documents of enormous historical transcendence."
2,langweillig!,"the beatles composed many nice songs but they could not act in the movie. The story in this film is absolutely nonsense, the band's popularity rose up in the UK & they ran and jumped with the screaming crowd. let me tell that the act of the musicians were ok in the music scene but terrific in the scenario!The songs they played are okay! but to be honest the Beatleswere a good band but not in the wide screen. That is the same childish story like their second one HELP.....if you re a die hard fans,..it is ok."
1,Very disappointed.,"Of all the billions, I am shocked that they have made no effort to provide subtitles."
2,"the music is okay, but the acting is terrible","some people are right! this skiffle beat band from liverpool is good in music (ok we respected these guys from the past Liverpool, though there are surely other better rock bands than beatles such as Led Zeppelin, deep purple, Pink Floyd, etc..)The soundtrack of the movie is acceptable, the songs are okay, but the acting makes no sense /terriffic!Elvis presley was a very good musician and accurate actor who could sing in the movie. but Beatles are not actors that could be included in the film...."
3,Wonderful direction and photography,"But this film left me cold. What was cutting edge in the 60s seems so naive now. I can see the joy and wonder experienced by the Beatles, but the film is unsatisfying as I simply failed to become engaged in the plot or the [real life] characters. I'm sure anything less than a 5 star review will be voted down by other reviewers (am I off the island), but I just don't get this. And I do like the Beatles."
2,Love the film but not the DVD,"I've tried to watch this DVD a number of times but the songs don't sound the way they should, the way they were meant to sound, and this ruins the entire movie for me. It's a shame because this movie is the greatest.Why can't they just release the movie in its original form so that viewing it would be like seeing it new in 1964? In the early nineties AMC played a lovely restored & cleaned up version. Why not release that version? Then, as a bonus, throw in some original trailers and the ""You Can't Do That"" footage.When you have a perfect film to begin with....don't mess with it!"
3,Not that much of an improvement....,Santa got me a blu ray and one of the first discs I bought was HARD DAY'S NIGHT being a total Beatles geek and it's the only BR I could find.The DVD redux they did a few years back was significant and I wasn't sure how the BR could look much better.IMHO - it doesn't.Still holding out for LET IT BE!!
2,Please give us back the original,"Since I originally saw this movie in the theater in 1964 and really dug it, I regretfully have to agree with Pete and David's reviews. Whatever was done to this movie on DVD took away the quality of the original. Perhaps this is the reason that you don't see interviews with any of the Beatles. The interviews that are on the second disc are very much meaningless and don't add to the flavor of the movie. It was cut badly in places that were not cut in the original, and I don't understand what was done with the soundtrack. In a single word the soundtrack is ""CRAPPY""! Perhaps if the entire movie would have been redubbed in Dolby 5.1 surround sound, it might have been better. This issue on DVD is not gear! So please, give us back the original and add the trailers."
2,The original DVD was better!,"I am glad I kept the original MPI DVD with the Stereo remixed versions of the songs. The music sounds flat and muddy. The only advatage to this version is that is widescreen. The bonus features are not all that great. I figured when this movie got released for a second time on DVD it would be far superior. My mistake! If you are lucky enough to find the original DVD, I recommend that over this. It's a shame seeing how well ""Yellow Submarine was done and the Anthology DVD set. I wasn't even happy with the packaging. When I saw the DVD I though ""This is it?"". Very bland like the audio and the bonus features. Why didn't Apple give this their superior treatment? Boo for Miramax!"
2,Why did they mess with the sound?,"Anyone with a 5.1 setup should read David Ranada's review in the December '02 issue of Sound & Vision prior to purchase. This version has a ""remixed and enhanced"" soundtrack. Nobody would put up with a colorized DVD of this film, yet that's exactly what they've done to the audio. As Ranada said, all this version does is drive up the price of the original MPI version."
1,Not Widescreen...Not Fullscreen...The Wost of All Worlds,"If you buy a DVD with the belief that it will come closer to the theater experience, & the intent of the artists, this is DVD is a definite disappointment. If you enjoy the wide-screen view of a theater, this DVD doesn't deliver. It crops widely from every direction: from the left, right, top, & bottom of the screen. And, if you prefer a full-screen format, because you don't like back bands, this DVD doesn't deliver either. You will still fully see two bands, both top & bottom of the screen. In terms of sound, it is neither fully state-of-the-art, nor is it a fully faithful replication of the original. This DVD is hardly worth it, at any price. Wait for the next reincarnation, one that is worthy of the artists' accomplishment.It is sad that Lennon's vision should be compromised by shortsighted production. Miramax has taken a bite out of Apple; it isn't original, but it is a sin nonetheless."
2,Poor quality soundtrack,"All the songs in this release sound as if they are playing too slow and too loud, with a booming, buzzy undertone. It's really distracting, even irritating. I sincerely hope they re-release this film in the near future with an improved soundtrack, as this one in my opinion is unacceptable, and does not do the Beatles credit."
4,Grows on You,"When I first tried to watch this movie, I quit halfway because I thought it was ridiculous and dumb. However, my 2nd and subsequent viewings of this irreverent film revealed it to be funny and enjoyable and even a singalong. I found the fans' selfish idolatry disturbing though. The film is quite clean with a few innuendos and one woman showing excessive cleavage."
2,Quality,I was really disappointed in the quality of this Blu-ray. I bought it thinking that the quality would be better then the DVD. As it turns out we prefer the DVD.
5,Great Movie,"I ordered this movie after Christmas, and it came in just in time for my birthday. I loved this movie. I've watched it so many times now. All four were great actors in this movie, and it's really witty. Plus the songs are great. The DVD itself could have been a little better-the behind the scenes features aren't that great, and I found some of them to be sort of boring. Some of the features need to be viewed by PC, and my computer was unable to download the special viewer needed to watch them. So rating on the Movie...5 stars-easily. The DVD..I'd say about 3. (the quality is VERY good though.)"
1,Five Star Movie - Zero Star DVD,"This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. I have been waiting since last summer when I relived this classic in the theater for this release. What a shame the result is the biggest train wreck of a DVD to come out in the last five years. Here are the problems as you will notice them:1. The cover is stupid. It looks like a variation on Let it Be wrapped in tin foil. Don't mess with a clssic...2. The ""extras"": two discs and no outtakes, commercials, trailers? ...didn't there you used to be a great little collage thing w/ ""Things we said today"" on the VHS tape that played right before the credits start? I loved that thing and yet its nowhere to be found here. I haven't watched the interviews yet so I can't comment on what is actually here.3. The sound: Too much bass in the 5.1 remixes of the songs. Why no option for a stereo mix or the origanl mono? The dialouge sounds great but the music made me adjust my sub.The transfer is great..."
3,Where is the trailer,"While I love this movie in any form, I was disappointed from the LACK of any materials we have come to expect from recent dvd's- no theatrical trailer, outtakes, deleted scenes, etc. The interview disc is good, if a little long-winded, but it doesn't make up for the missing materials featuring the band and not everyone around them. I took the inclusion of such materials for granted. My mistake."
2,"Looks Good, Sounds Terrible","I bought ""A Hard Day's Night"" and I am really disappointed. It would not play in my Toshiba Carousel DVD player. The added interviews (filler) do not interest me. The mono soundtrack had some type of weird phasing sound when I played it on an Apex DVD player connected to my stereo TV. To make sure I wasn't hearing things, I played it on my desktop PC DVD player through studio monitors. The remastering sounds like it was heavily processed with noise reduction, and then the lows and highs were boosted."
2,Great companion to the original DVD release,"Still a great movie. That fact has been established already, no need to address that here.I liked the George Martin interview...interesting! The extras on the disc get quite monotonous. They might as well interviewed the janitor who cleaned up Lennon's puke.....all kidding aside...Miramax was really scraping up interviews to make this a 2 cd affair.Other reviews have nailed this recent package well. Like where is the ""Running, Jumping, Standing Still"" movie and the Beatle numbers not included in the actual film.The sound leaves something to be desired. I prefer my original Hard Day's Night dvd when the sound was in 2.0 not the 5.1 surround. Believe it or not the 2.0 sounded much better than this new mix of 5.1!I didn't know they filmed this movie in widescreen...my original dvd version is not in widescreen.All in all this new packaging and audio mix leaves ALOT to be desired and is not a be all end all statement to a classic like A Hard Day's Night."
3,Phony Stereo and Not for Mac Users,"The movie's still fun, but two things surprised and disappointed me about it.First of all, all of the songs have been artificially ""stereo-ized."" This effect is about as convincing as the ""Wide"" button on a boombox and is pretty cheesy, especially if you listen on headphones. I would have preferred the original mono mixes re-mastered with super-clear DVD audio quality.Next, as a Mac user, I'm totally shut out of a number of DVD extras I was interested in, such as viewing the movie script. Miramax loses big points for not even considering us Mac users, many of whom are musicians and likely buyers of this DVD. There's no note on the box warning us, and not even a respectful, ""sorry, losers."" Boo to them."
3,A good film but with bad sound,"A hard day's night always my favorite beatles film, but I am really disappointed with the sound of this DVD re-release, the echo sound is too ""strange"". I tend to buy the original MPI 1997 release instead, but I found that there is no place at Amazon marketplace for the sellers listing this product, if anyone know where I can get this, please email to me at igpatric@inet.polyu.edu.hkBig Thanks!"
4,Hard Day's Night Classic,"I'm middle aged so I guess thats why I liked this from the first time I saw it. Being a Beatles fan from the beginning of time. However this purchase was for my 16 year old Daughter, who is a bigger fan of the ""Fab Four"" than I ever was. I'm assuming that this is the ""Retro Phase"" that today's youth are experiencing, and I'm glad in a way because I've always been of the opinion that yesterday's music is much better than a lot of the recent trends that is considered music today. Some of these current artist's scare me a little with their lack of musical talent, and their constant re-recording of earlier artists/true musicians works, and making money off of someone else's efforts.I will always love the Beatle's work, and am glad to see their earlycreations recorded for todays technology."
5,A Hard Days Night,This is my favorite Beatles film. They were so young and full of life. The music is classic Beatles.
5,Who's That Little Old Man?,"This is a quick review of the VHS - the DVD seems to be taking a trouncing here.At any event, ""A Hard Days' Night"" is a good-time movie, one of the best ever made. I love every part of it - the songs, the rapid-fire Liverpool banter, and of course the boys themselves before they grew beards - so incredibly young and carefree.And don't forget Wilfrid Brambell - that very clean little old man. As we all know, he belongs to Paul."
4,"Good Movie, But Unimaginative Extras","""A Hard Day's Night"" is an enjoyably, lighthearted, featherweight comedy/musical, which was the first film from the Beatles. It has a certain charm and spontaneity that was never captured in any of the later Beatles films. The songs, while not their best, are pretty good (especially the title number), and it has one of the best opening credits I can think of.The two disc DVD shows the movie in good shape, with crisp, sharp, clear, widescreen black and white image. The sound, too, is as good as you could want. The disappointment comes from the second disc of extras. An entire second disc of extras is wasted on overlong interviews with everybody involved in the making of the film that you DON'T care about hearing from. Ooh, a talk with the son of the Beatles' tailor! I'M OVERJOYED! C'mon, couldn't the makers of this even spring for Ringo?"
3,poor sound quality but still a great movie,"This was the first DVD title I bought, and I was disappointed by the sound quality. There is hardly any surround sound at all; For most of the movie, only the center channel is used, and the dialog sounds quite muddy. When there is a musical selection, the front L&R speakers kick in nicely, but the volume is much louder. Once the song is done, the volume returns to a lower level, and only the center channel is heard once again. The only time I heard my rear speakers was during the concert scene at the end of the film. If you buy this DVD expecting true 5.1 surround, you will be disappointed. But, the film itself is still a classic."
3,Good to see the Beatles,"Well this movie was made in 1964 at the height of Beatlemania and so it is a slice of history made at that special time-a real phenomenon. It is good to see the Beatles run around and play their music. There really was not another time like this for anyone/group ever. Maybe Elvis came close...but rally this was an amazing time period.As for the movie/story line, there really is not much. So buy the movie because this is a time capsule of a rare event and watch it to see the Beatles perform and do not expect any sort of plot- there is no drama here."
5,A cinematic wonder--not just because it is by the Beatles...,"although that helps too. Everyone's sugar-coated view of The Beatles was manifested in this movie. The boys were in their 20's when this was filmed, yet they playfully romp through this film like energetic 16 year olds. Of course, the most fascinating part of the film is the music--which is lip synched by the Beatles on film yet compensated for by the wonderful photography and shots of their faces. Each Beatle's personality was taken and exaggerated to the point of caricature for the sake of humor, yet the Liverpudlian wit was not at all an imagined element of The Beatles.Ringo Starr was hailed as the ""next Charlie Chaplin"" for his role in the film. Indeed, he was a natural on film but so were Paul's wide-eyed innocent glances, John's rascally smirks, and George's deadpan quips.A true classic."
1,A Hard Day's Night..Hard on the Ears!,"It is my considered opinion that whoever is responsible for the ""digital remastering"" of the songs on this DVD should be shot! Believe me...I LOVE THE BEATLES! That is why I'm so disappointed. For one thing, the levels are totally screwy. But to really hear just how f---ed up the sound is, listed to Paul's vocal on ""And I Love Her"". Then go and put on the cd or better yet your old vinyl version. You've got hear it to believe it. I'm sending mine back today. :-( Don't waste your money."
2,WHAT'S WITH THE SOUND ???,"With such a deluxe package, why only 5.1 audio track ? This movie was originally in mono. I would welcome that! When I called Miramax, they said it was in 2.0 only. Well, my dvd player reads it in 5.1 only. I dont own surround sound (and dont want it) and I sure didn't think with such a deluxe package, that I had to worry about an audio track. It sounds processed when I play it. Thanks Miramax !!!"
3,IF IT'S PERFECT.....RUIN IT!!!!,"THEY HAVE TAKEN A PERFECTLY GREAT FILM..AND RUINED IT AGAIN..FIRST TIME..THEY TOOK OFF THE ORIGINAL SOUNTRACK AND PUT ON A DIGITAL STEREO ONE...GEE THANKS!!NOW THEY HAVE TAKEN THAT SOUNDTRACK AND RUINED THAT ONE!!!HOW??? LISTEN TO THE ""ECHO"" ON THE SONGS THAT ARE SUNG ""LIVE"" AT THE END..IS THAT NEEDED?? WHY NOT HAVE THE ORIGINAL MONO TRACK AS WELL AS THE STEREO ONE? BUT DON'T SCREW WITH IT..MAYBE A LAUGH TRACK ON HELP????"
3,Disappointed!,"How disappointing! Unlike previous releases of this movie on VHS and DVD, this one does not use the actual stereo soundtracks for the music interludes. What you have here is enhanced mono of the songs. I'll stick with my MPI version with stereo music, thank you."
1,Review,"I can't change the stars of the review, but I now give it five stars. The movie is great, the songs are great, the DVD transfer is great. I highly recommend this DVD."
1,Cover your ears!,"The dialog is easy to hear and understand, but they did something awful to the music. Whenever they sing it sounds like they're in a barrel; the songs were just ruined."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If your idea of a enjoyable movie is 100 minutes of hanging out with the Beatles, by all means watch this movie, but if you want a little bit more than a glorified home video whose idea of characterization is assigning each Beatle a single trait, watch something else."
5,A Hard Days Night,I own this dvd and watched it a dozen times I like it. You never realize how funny they can be until you have seen them in a movie acting. It reminds me about funny flashbacks of hotdogs and yellow submarine and other strange hallucinations. If you look at some of the actors in the background you might think of other influences like FZ or Bo Diddly. I thought the bonus stuff was mostly lacking though in the movie there was a lot of live and concert footage anyways. It was very dreamlike to watch in a sense it was unreal probably because it's totally black & white. Very revealing if you ever find yourself emersed in BeatlemaniaYellow SubmarineThe Wizard of OzEnsemble Modern Plays Frank Zappa: Greggery Peccary & Other PersuasionsBob Dylan - Don't Look Back
3,"Where is ""You Can't Do That""???","The stars are for the movie. Love the movie. As for release as a DVD?...1 star only. You Can't Do That has been available for quite some time and should have been included here as part of a definitive release. It is supposed to be a collectors edition after all. The failure of Miramax to include that is upsetting. Picture is fine, except some flashes and marks here and there. Could have been cleaned up a bit. But the sound...a mono mix probably would have been better. The sound is as bad as you remember. Perhaps, that is the best they could do. If so, so be it. If not, I should ask for my money back."
3,"OK, but I would not call this bluray - ASIN b002p4jkfa","This is only for the ASIN above, a Canadian release, with titles both in French and English. I have no idea about the other releases.This BD has the video quality of a mediocre DVD. Audio in English and French 5.1 and no subtitles. The movie - fantastic. The special features are great. Interviews after interviews.So 5 stars for contents, 1 for the quality of the print."
4,Why Not Closed Captioned?,"As one with deaf friends Im very disappointed, that this film (and HELP!) are not Closed Captioned for the hearing impaied. I had a friend who lost his hearing,and who was a very big fan of the beatles, and it has hurt him greatly,PLEASE do something about this."
4,He's clean...,"A Hard Day's Night is a Beatles classic, and it was high time for it to be spruced up as it is now. With tons of extra stuff, this is just all a Beatles fan could want.But about the plot, this film is a whole movie of goofs and inside jokes thrown in with some songs. This is why it's funny and influential in it's own little way. The Byrds for example found great inspiration for what they wanted their band to be like after seeing this film.My only disturbance is that I just don't get some of the jokes, but hey it's still good (and maybe being British helps a bit, although maybe not.)If you love the Beatles then you'll love this, otherwise you should still like it."
5,DONT THINK TWICE!,"I'm having a lot of trouble to get this dvd movie of The Beatles, the best band ever was and ever will be. Anyways, if you can buy this item - don't even think about other possiblety except buying it.""A Hard Day's Night"" is a terrific movie about The Beatles on their prime, watching their real lives behind the scenes. And also to take an unforgetable look at the guys who made music what it is today."
4,"Like Those Early Videos/Albums, But With Better Sound","Yeah, this movie is a silly at many times but it's supposed to be and, by now, just to have so many of the early Beatles songs on one film is a real treat, like a collector's item.The old songs permeate this movie and sound great in 5.1 digital surround, as opposed to how they first sounded on records when they were released decades ago.The story is really nothing but showing the Beatles traveling to do a concert and quirky behind-the-scenes goings-on. This is a good period piece because of the dress, songs and British expressions of the day (i.e. ""Grotty,"" meaning ""grotesque."")This movie offers great nostalgia to all who loved The Beatles and their songs. I'm wondering what happened to the Blu-Ray that was supposedly issued. It's a shame; I'd like to see this on the best format available."
1,HARD to believe- NIGHT and DAY,"I saw the 1982 re-issue of this film at CARNEGIE HALL's cinema in NYC--the sound on that presentation was HORRENDOUS--screechy and tinny--like a bad DRIVE-IN theatre speaker! This DVD is just a shambles too--similar poor dynamic range,flat,compressed,lifeless sound. THE BEATLES sounding like THIS? I'll take other reviewers words regarding chopped-off cropping of the picture as well (I don't own the previous AHDN video editions to do my own A/B comparison). I'm shocked this was allowed to happen on such a high profile project."
5,Oh Yah! Finally on DVD!!,"I have loved this movie from the start and I have eagerly awaited a digital version. Here it is and I am jazzed. The picture quality is just great, for older black and white film originals. I like the wide-screen format very much. That is the only way to go.The movie seems to have been re-done intact, so I am very happy with the flow and sequence of the film. Then there are the extras. I thought that having a second disk was a bit much, but, I did really enjoy the material. You'll have to see for yourself. I like the insights from the ""Fifth Beatle,"" and the comments from the people who actually worked on the project. The bit I like most is finding out that the tailor, whose measuring tape is cut by John, is actually the tailor who made all their suits. Trust me, If you have enjoyed A Hard Day's Night before, you'll love it all over again."
3,"Wonderful movie, but the DVD sound was VERY disappointing!","I agree with the other reviews. I had been anticipating this release for some time only to be really disappointed in the quality (or lack thereof) on the ""remastered Dolby 5.1"" sound. John, Paul, George, and Ringo are still the Fab Four, and they deserve better than this release. Why do the people running the entertainment industry have such contempt for their artists and their customers?"
5,What is wrong with you!?!?!,"How the F*** can Cranky Reviewer (who by the way has wrotten some of the worst reviews ever. Check his area to see) say the beatles are a freaking rip-off of Oasis?!?! I mean F***, the bandmembers might havent even been borned yet!! Technacily Oasis is a good band but to say this blasfemy is just stupid! Im thinking hes doing this to anger us, but really.-By the way the movie is great. Great songs and the visual for those songs is awesome, though one can say it INSPIRED, NOT RIPED-OFF, Oasis and maybe that lame Spice world movie."
2,the sound is yikes! the acting is a nonsense!,"hmmh...how bad this remastered version is. But this isn't a remastered version, what other people thought.The songs are sounding very slowed down and muddied.What a waste of time, money, and ultimately the version might ruin people's perception of the movie.Unfortunately I have bought the old VHS version,...which has the same quality like this one. The cover looks great, the sound is bad and the acting of the musicians in the movie is a nonsense, they were only running and jumping. Many people bought this film because it is the beatles that's all!PS: I agree with some people, who said some other rock bands are much better than Beatles like the Black Sabbath Dvd's, Led Zeppelin dvd's or Deep purple Dvd's are much better than this one."
2,you all fell in love with the guys from the past!,"yes you are! this film is exactly a good nostagia for all die hard beatle fans but some people who do not like beatles, they do not have any interrest in this dvd film. More over the DVD version is not really as good as I thought,...it lacked the system! see all reviewers below, they have the same opinion like us! my question is: why didn't the film company try to color this black & white film? I guess it should have been coloured, haven't it? LET IT BE is a good & last Beatle film...but it wasn't yet released on DVD,....what a big pity is it!Don't buy this!"
2,"Boring, boring, boring.","I like the Beatles, I like British humor (big fan of Python), and I like movies about music. But this movie is so slow and boring, I don't know what the big deal is? Sure, it's great watching the Beatles run around, and you get a sense of their chemistry. And of course, the music is fantastic. But the directing is sloppy, the jokes unfunny, and the invisible storyline painfully tedious. More of a curiosity picture than a movie. For die-hard Beatles fans only. Even the Monkees were better at this sort of thing..."
1,Damaged,DVD did not play......vendor did not return emails. Will never purchase anything from them again. Very angry! My child was extremely disappointed that one of his birthday presents was broken before he ever used it.
5,"My ""Desert Island"" Book","I bought my copy of this great book over twenty years ago as a teen. What I love most is that it is not a dry compilation of facts, but a wonderful collection of information presented in a fascinating and entertaining way. After all this time, I still get it down from my bookcase and read for the hundredth time about ""Footnote People in U. S. History"" or ""Man-Made Disasters."" If you can find a copy, buy it. You won't be disappointed."
5,This has been a favorite of mine for years!,This has been one of my favorite disks for several years. It's not something that gets play for a month or so and then collects dust. It really has longterm play value! It's the best of Jim Croce and Don McLean...just really happy music :)
5,French Bread pan by Chicago Metallic,"Made homemade sour dough bread from my starter, wonderful result, am using it weekly."
1,I Just Threw Mine In the Garbage,"I bought the predecessor to this pan about twenty years ago. It served me very well. Bread didn't stick to it, the non-stick coating didn't come off, and it always produced good bread. I replaced it only because I made the mistake of laying it down on a hot burner on my stove and damaged it.I bought this pan about six months ago. Within about half a dozen uses, the ""non-stick"" (more on ""non-stick"" later) coating was being rubbed off on the bottom of the pan. Shortly thereafter, bread would stick to the edges of the pan. Today, bread stuck to nearly the entire pan, although the bread dough wasn't at all sticky when I put it into the pan. I couldn't get the bread out of the pan. It's in the garbage now. I'm done with this pan, and I'm done with Chicago Metallic (actually made in China) equipment."
5,perfect loaves,"using these pans produces a loaf that is brown,crusty all around, with those little bumps you typically associate with commercial artisanal long loaves. i use floured canvas to shape the loaves and to place them on the bread pan. with 2 pans (4 loaves) you will be able to accommodate a typical recipe that starts with 3.5 cups of flour.these loaves are a little larger than the other pan offered, producing loaves up to 3.5"" in diameter and up to 16"" long. they fit in my smallish oven that, regrettably, cannot fit a standard half-sheet pan.using a pizza stone in the oven brings an even heat difficult to get any other way. i recommend theAll-Clad Pizza Baker/Stonebecause it has a frame that prevents breakage and a stone that holds heat (also necessary for a really good focaccia at 550 degrees).bon appetit.5 stars."
3,Non-stick? hahahahahhahaha,"well just made two loaves of french bread in the supposednon stick pan. forget it. had to pry the loaves off the pan with a butterknife. the dough, admittedly was sticky but hey.on the good side. the bread i salvaged did have a nicely baked crust(the side that is on the perforations.)i guess ill have to line the pan with parchment next time but then that defeats the crustiness of the perforations"
3,Dough comes through the holes,"This pan works great for firmer bread dough but don't try it with soft sourdough without first lining it with parchment paper. I tried it twice and both times it oozed through the tiny holes while rising and then firmly baked to the pan. I had a devil of a time chipping the bread loose after it was baked. It did make a great crust and it kept its shape, but the bread was torn on the bottom from sticking."
1,Never Again,"I will never buy a product from this manufacturer again! All edges rough, sharp in places. Some non-stick scratched off so it will start to peal off before long. It's from China, naturally. I threw it away."
2,nothing special,"kinda a rip for 20 bucks plus shipping. Basically the only thing it does is act as a couche during proofing. I will say that it does produce even baking and good browning. The reason I purchased is because lack of choices , even online."
4,Sticking problem,These pans are great and well built but the bread will stick when the directions are followed as written. It is important to spray the pans with non-stick cooking spray to avoid this. Even using oil will not work and cleaning the pans after the bread has stuck in every little hole is a problem.
3,Should the paint scrape off on first use?,"I am a novice baker who has just started baking bread using a Peter Reinhart book as a guide. Although I have followed his advice and baked French baguettes on a hearthstone,I saw this perforated pan and thought I would give it a try. The bread turned out as well as those baked on a stone, but the paint scraped or burned off the underside of the pan after one use. I did not overheat the pan and I hadn't even washed it yet when I noticed the flaking paint. I had thought I might give these pans to my baking friends as birthday or Christmas presents but have reconsidered."
4,French Bread Pan,"I have made several loaves of French Bread so far and everyone of them has come out perfect using the pan. The only negative I have found is in the clean up. You have to be very creful with cleaning the pan, as the non-stick coating can/does chip easily. Outside of that, pan works great."
5,Great Pan!,"I just received this pan the other day and already baked French Bread. The pan worked out wonderfully! The bread had a gorgeous, crunchy crust baked to a perfect golden brown without getting too brown on the bottom!I'm thinking of order the 3-loave version too!I'm so proud of my bread! Come see it at [...]Michelle"
5,My favorite layer cake pans,"I own Chicago Metallic cake pans in several sizes, and love them. They're true to size and perfectly straight sided. The heavy, light colored aluminum ensures an even, light crust (not dark and heavy, the way some nonstick pans are). In my experience, the nonstick pans require butter and flour anyway, so the aluminum pans clearly come out ahead. They're also excellent value for money--they cost less than some lesser pans."
1,Misleading description,While this may be a great cake pan I purchased it because the decription said manufactured in USA. After waiting about a week for delivery I'm turning right around and sending it back because the label says made in China which is not what I agreed to buy. Don't tell me I'm buying one thing and then send me another.
1,Hateful & meanspirited trash,"I was shocked at the way the Lilo character was dipicted in this sickening film from Disney.First off, Lilo brutally beats a little girl mercilessly simply because she disagrees with her.Then, her older sister jay-walks then kicks a car and throws an insult at the driver for no reason.Next, we see Lilo living in a house of pure filth and her older sister leaves the stove on while she's not at home. It saddened me to see Lilo's older sister threaten violence against Lilo and then Lilo responds with horrid insults against her sister.This is a very disturbing image of what Disney calls ""an alternative family"". This film has absolutely no redeeming value can not teach your child anything about life that he or she couldn't already learn from the gutter..."
1,Please do not let your child watch this movie,"This movie is not only strange, but it is also yet another let down in mindless entertainment that your child will emulate through bratty and selfish behavior later.I have been having a difficult time with my 4 year old lately and the movie choices that are out there. Disney has ultimately been a huge let down to me with the vocabulary that my child is picking up on. Everything from ""jerk"", ""stupid"", ""stupid head"" and ""idiot""; I have had enough. While these words might seem harmless they are not and sound disgusting coming from the mouth of a young child.Do not waste your time with this ridiculous movie - find something else with family values that can set a better example."
3,Ok,"I rented this movie based on the positive reviews listed here, and I have to say I was a little disappointed. I went into the film with high hopes for fun, and there were some funny moments, but a lot of it felt flat and way too far-fetched. Now, granted, it's Disney, and they're all the magic of fairy tales, but ""Lilo and Stitch"" was missing something. Perhaps it was lacking the magic."
4,Condition of the Lilo and Stitch DVD,The box was in great condition and looked to have everything inside it the way it is suppose to. i was disappointed though in the fact that the dvd has a bad enough scratch on it that at a certain area of the movie it stops and then resumes again about a minute later. luckily it is only in one place in the movie that it does this in but it was still a bit disappointing. for the price i got it for though i guess i can not be to upset.
3,An educational experience,"This movie is a great tool for teaching children the meaning of ""deus ex machina"".There is quite a bit of build-up in the struggle of Lilo's sister to prove that she is a worthy caretaker for her much younger sister. She consistently tries but can't quite get it right, thanks in no small part to Lilo herself. And just when things look the bleakest, we get a ""just kidding!"" end.The trouble is that things got to a point where there was no other way to resolve the plot with a happy ""family stays together"" ending. It left me asking what the point of all the build-up was. Because, happy or not, there's no getting around the fact that the ending was a cheat."
5,An Instant Classic!!!!!,"Lilo & Stich is an instant classic,no doubt about it!!This movie is just plain spactacular!!A girl named Lilo and her older Sister Nonnie live in a little house on Hawaii.Meanwhile in space,a mad scientist named Jumba creats experiment 626 A.K.A. Stich.The space council considers 626 an abomination so they lock up Jumba and are about to send 626 somewhere into space,just then 626 escapes,takes a ship,and blasts out into space,unfortunatly,he lands right on Hawaii.He gets run over by 3 or 4 trucks,the people that were driving the trucks gave him to the pet store.Lilo and Nonnie go to the pet store one day and get Stich.For the first 1/2 of the movie their enemys are Jumba and Pleakly.The 2nd 1/2 is where the TRUE enemy steps in,Ganto(i may have spelled that wrong.)2nd leader of the council.There is also a t.v. show on disney channel.buy this movie dude!!!sincerly,kenny"
3,OK,"Not nearly as great as expected.. I'm sure it's great for kids, but this is an over 30 reviewer...Yes, technically proficient, but story is nothing special... Get ""Spirited Away"" instead"
4,Cute Disney Film,This film is a new breed of Disney. I enjoyed most of it and found it very cute not to mention the fantastic watercolored backrounds that gave it that extra paradise feel to it.Why four stars? i thought the begging was kind of strange and at the ending is sort of streched a bit.Overall: fun and beautiful to look at.
3,"It was cute, but...","I'll have to say that the movie was cute at some points. But the reason I give it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because I don't think Disney himself would have entirely approved of the movie. For instance, the AC/DC music. Another thing is, I don't really care for the animation. I wish the animators would have stuck with the original Disney and made the people look like real people, and not cartoons. That just takes away some of its appeal for me. But that's just me!I won't give this movie an entirely poor rating, in the opinion that it had a nice storyline and cute characters. But if you like the classic Disney animation (Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, etc.) like me, then I wouldn't necessarily recommend this movie to you. I thought it was okay, but in my opinion I think it could have been better."
4,It's about family,"My husband grew up on Maui and remembers with great fondness what it was like growing up with the Aloha feeling in the air. This movie was able to bring that all back to him. I was about to cry during a very poignant moment in the movie and turned to him for comfort only to find that he was crying. I had to be the strong one! It would be wonderful for more people to understand the feeling of Aloha and how important it is to be ohana.The movie is well done and beautifully animated. The characters reminded my husband of people he grew up with . The body shapes of the characters were very stereotypical of the native Hawaiians. These were real people, not some fantasy image that no one could relate to.I look forward to sharing this one with my children. I want them to know that they are ohana--family."
5,Best Disney Film in Years and One of the Best of 2002,"This is quite simply the most imaginative, creative, and fun Disney film in years. The animation is stunning and beautiful recalling the wonderfully detailed cartoons of 1940' and 50's. Unlike like recent Disney efforts, Lilo and Stitch doesn't just devolve into a series of poorly animated musics videos with all star voices. This is a classic along the lines of The Iron Giant and the Miyazaki films (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke). The opening sequence featuring Stitch's escape in an absolutely hilarious masterpiece of animation. Enjoyable for adults and children with a positive message that isn't forced or overly sentimental. Far and away more impressive on any level than other highly touted Disney epics like the Lion King or Beauty and the Beast! One of the finest films of 2002. A must see!"
5,Fantastic Film for all Ages,"I saw this movie for the first time last night with my wife. Let me just say, I think this might be one of the best Disney films - right up there with the big ""four"" - The Little Mermiad, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.I was in Disney World last year. I have to admit I was a naysayer. I couldn't understand what all these little kids were obsessing about. Stitch was the most popular character there. He was even my wake-up call every morning. However, after seeing this film, now I know what the fuss is about. This film is great for all ages and ranks among the best in the Disney franchise.With memorable characters, a touching story, and colorful animation, this is a Disney classic."
4,The Family & The Love...,"Lilo is a misunderstood girl who is struggling with the loss of her parents while her overworked sister is providing a home and care for her. One day they decide to adopt a puppy for Lilo and they find Stitch. Stitch is not really a dog, but an escaped extra-terrestrial convict that is the result of an illegal genetic experiment. Stitch decides to follow Lilo home in order to evade the long arm of the law. The two of them find a connection and they build something they both miss. Lilo & Stitch is a film about family, belongingness, and love that is experienced through hilarious laughs and serious thoughts."
2,"Movie is great, but DVD is terrible","Lilo & Stitch is one of Disney's gems, along with The Emperor's New Groove. Too bad both of them were not ""qualified"" enough to make it to the Walt Disney ""Masterpiece"" collection.This particular movie has wonderful backgrounds, and the human character designs are very appealing. Unfortunately, the DVD does not provide an animation fan with ANYTHING--director commentary, character model sheets, background shots, storyboard comparison...none of this is on the DVD. Just kiddie activites like ""Take a trip to Hawaii!"" and ""Let's make an alien!"" At least they put the movie in widescreen.Hopefully they will provide us with a 2-disc special edition with the good stuff...the stuff that made this movie a gem."
2,Just okay for us,"Lilo & Stitch is an okay movie if you really want to see this Disney movie.Pros: The music was lively and seemed to match the scenes (especially if you are an Elvis fan) and the Stitch character was somewhat cute (when he tapped into his sensitive side and he wasn't being destructive)Cons: A little too much reality for a Disney flick, the main characters lacked warmth, appeared bratty (and violent), and the beginning alien scenes seemed a little long.I really just wanted to rent this but unfortunately had to purchase it in order to view it.I don't recommend it."
3,love the movie but,I love this movie and I had purchased it for our daughter. The dvd itself was in excellant condition but the case was a mess hence the 3 stars. Used-very good was the discription I count the overall appearenece as a whole to include the casing in which it came in. Other then that excellant movie shows how kids really are and that everybody has a need to feel wanted. Have loved this movie since it came out and its very child appropriate unlike other disney movies this one applies to actual kids and kid behavior. Not to mention it shows that not all children are raised or have parents.
5,Very cute movie. Good for adults & kids.,The movie is very entertaining and different. Kids and Adults would love it; it has good family values in the end and it's hilarious.
4,Good,"It was for my grandson, he likes it. I have not watch it, but he is happy and that is the main thing. Thanks Denia"
5,I loved it!,"I loved Lilo and Stitch. It was the most adorable cartoon I've seen! The story idea was hilarious, and the way it was presented was equaly funny. Stisch is an adorable mischif maker created by Jumba, an evil genious with a Russian accent. The cast of characters was great.I also loved that the drawings in this movie were not Disny's usual perfect-figure drawings. It made the movie much warmer."
2,this is trash,"to get straight to the point i really dislike this movie the lesseon it teaches is boring and besides, the movie isnt all that moving and uplifting.i think disney could have thought of something better."
2,Lilo & Stitch,"The DVD ""stutters"" in several places, for a fairly significant time in one place. Hardly ""very good"" condition, as described."
3,It is okay,There were elements in the video that I would not show my 5 year old. I got this for the school I worked at and we had to turn it off
4,LILO & stitch,"The movie was in great shape. Our family really enjoyed the movie. However, the plastic holder for the DVD was broken."
4,stitch rules!,"this story is all about a little girl who finds a space experiment which is actualy a very super human alien that vaguely resembles a dog.hes blue and furry.he climbs walls,breaks stuff,protects lilo and has unbelivable strength.the kids will love it.it takes place in or is it on hawaii.lilos older sister is alright for a animated chick.lilos rival is this little snotty white girl who thinks her !@#$%stuff dont stink.oh!and a giant shark headed mammoth whos on the warpath.stitch wins the best character in disney history award for being so cute and lovable.im sure they could manage a lilo and stitch 2.we'll see."
3,Walt would not approve,"We got this movie for my son for Christmas. He's 3 years-old and absolutely loves it. And it is a very cute flick. However, there are some questionable items in the movie that I think may have Walt Disney rolling in his grave. For instance, at one point a character calls another a ""stupid head."" While that may not seem like a big deal by today's standards, it doesn't seem to have a place in a Disney movie."
2,THIS MOVIE IS ONLY FOR KIDS........,"As I watched this movie, I kept on wandering when it was going to get better, and weave that magic spell that only disney can do, but it never came. The movie draged on and on, without a real meaning. It did not seem like a disney movie at all. I only hope that they will come out with a better movie. I give it two stars because the kids liked it, although I wish I never bought it, but at least it entertained the kids, but only the kids."
5,Great Kids Movie,This is a great follow up to the original movie. It is funny and cleaver with a nice message of tolerance and acceptance.
3,i am insane,"i cry every single time i watch this movie, that is because it is sad. so i cry. IS THAT GOOD FOR YOU?? I HAVE NEVER NOT CRIED WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE. HOW ABOUT NEVER, IS NEVER GOOD FOR YOU???? I AM GOING INSANE, YES I AM THE SAME PERSON WHO WROTE THE PSYCHO SPIRIT:STALLiON OF THE CIMMARON REVIEW.I OWN THIS MOVE"
3,Scary for young children,"I watched this on a United flight while traveling on business. I enjoyed it much more than I thought that I would. However, I was glad that my two toddlers were not with me. In typical Disney fashion, there were a lot of really scary parts. Even more than usual, I think. It was a well done movie. I just wouldn't recommend it for young kids who are bothered by violence or suspense. There was plenty of both."
4,cute story; no fairy tale here.,"I liked this movie in the theatres, and my kids have watched it over and over at home. While the storyline is good, it doesn't have the laugh impact of Monster's Inc."
4,suprising,"not suprising for disney of course, disney is always great. i put in this movie expecting the expected. light entertainment with some good laughs. this movie was different. i was a little disturbed. lol. i mean its a story about this little ferocious monster that destroys everything he touches. and he's really mean and disgusting and obscene. and this broken home with two sisters. very instable. the little girl is sick, you know? disturbed or something. but it was funny. the director took a different appraoch. i personally liked the social worker, ""cobra bubbles"" the best. ving rhames supporting the voice. he was great."
5,Funalicious,Fantastic movie! Fun for all ages and really sweet without being too cliched. The DVD has some good features on it- worth the extra money just to see the cute trailers.
3,Okay condition,I live this movie and the story of it. It was really cute and my sons first time seeing it he loved it.. Just that now its all scratched I need to buy a new one now... I recommend blu ray all the wat Just cause they don't get scratched so u actually save
1,Don't buy Lilo & Stitch,"This is a very non-Disney movie if you ask me. Besides having a very odd story line, this movie has encouraged my 3-year-old son to hit/punch/bite (because Lilo does) and use the word ""stupid."" I had to hide the DVD so he can't watch it anymore. I definitely don't recommend this movie!"
1,"Great music, that's it.","I assumed it would be a cute movie for my 3 year old to watch. I found the space aliens looked very much like the monsters of Monsters Inc. ,so no originality there. I also found it to be too violent and too many bad examples for young children."
1,DISNEY!,"Another bad disney movie. They haven't made anything good since Tarzan. Everything since then has been terrible. Not to mention I am getting tired of disney doing their little take offs on star wars! This movie is long, boring and in need of serious re writing."
4,Colorful,"""Lilo and Stitch"" was pretty colourful and suprising, I thought. Bit of a treat to watch, actually. Wasn't quite like a Disney, and yet it was. Sees an experimental alien Stitch lifeform crashland with a single mother and her daughter, Lilo. Worth a look for fans of unique animation."
4,Closest to being a Disney Classic in last few years.,"I liked this Disney movie, first one since the Lion King. It's cute, fun and hilarious. First time in a disney movie a woman is potrayed realitically, which gives the movie an extra star. Lilo, is SO cute, and is so clever. The beginning sequence is horrible though, the whole outer space scenes are unbearable. As well as many of the Alien characters, except of course Stitch, and the mosquito one. The movie is laughed-packed, with Elvis music, and even some tears. It is original, and hits close to home. Disney did well, It's been a while, and it will be a while for the next. It's great for little kids, the movie's not only great but the DVD has some great features, including one on how to do the Hula. If you're a kid at heart, or have some small fry around think about getting this Disney."
2,Disney's Going Down the Tubes,"Okay, so Lilo & Stitch is one of their more original movies lately (as opposed to the current trend to make sequels from their classics), but it was depressing, mean-spirited and just downright sad. What does the Disney Corporation have against two parent families? Why make a movie about a monster whose sole purpose for existence is to destroy? Yes, yes, little girl tames wild beast, but come on. And the scenes with her sister were downright scary. The screaming... yes, it is rather reminiscent of many sisterly fights, but do we need to see that in a cartoon?Disney needs to go back to making the people look real. Why the exaggerated features? Look at Sleeping Beauty and Snow White and Cinderella. Why are those movies still so widely loved? Because of the absolute *artistry* contained within. That would be nice to see from Disney. Move away from the computers and get back to drawing.So, Lilo & Stitch, original, but depressing. Don't bother."
2,Lilo and Stitch,Lilo and Stitch is based on a little girl that just needs a friend. I think That Lilo is a little brat because she just dismissed Stitch just because he did something bad and she didn't even give him a second chance.I do not not recomend this movie to little kids.If you don't like depresing movies you shouldn't see this movies.
1,Horrible,"Who wants to show their kids a movie about a bunch of desperately unhappy people? Everywhere Lilo turns there are people trying to make her life miserable. Then comes Stitch from outer space, who is violent and disrespectful, and this is what is supposed to make Lilo feel like she finally ""belongs?"" Not only did I greatly dislike the basic plot, I also found the movie to have SO many ridiculous twists and turns it was as if the writers didn't know where to end it. Horrible from beginning to end, to end, to end..."
5,a great film for disney and elvis fans,"Lilo & Stitch is another magical Disney film,my daughter Dana and her father ( who is a big elvis fan )loved it.A great film with lots of laughter and sad bits too,a must for any disney & Elvis fans SO GO AND BUY IT NOW! you won,t regret it."
3,Great for Older Kids.. But............,"This is a fun, strange and quite amusing little flick, assuming you're an adult and/or have kids that are older.For those with younger children, don't let the Disney name fool you, as this isn't standard kid's fare, and the violence, name calling, abuse and utter disregard for values is troubling and should not be part of a young child's movie collection.Me, I enjoyed the flick, but no way I'm letting my 3-year old near it until she's much older."
4,Good For Both Boys and Girls,"Our whole family liked this movie that we regretfully didn't see untill it was released on video. We have a little boy and girl so it is nice to find a movie that will appeal to them both. Usually the Disney movies are geared towards one gender or the other, but both the kids liked this one. I really liked the Elvis music instead of the normal sappy tunes that accompany the ""kiddie"" movies and I found the sarcasm great! I also liked the message, sometimes the ones you love drive you nuts, but you would never want anyone in the family to be left behind."
3,"good movie, but not for little kids","I LOVED this movie. The story line was a little out there for Disney, but they did a good job with it.The songs were great.I wouldn't let little kids watch it though. There's a little too much violence in it."
5,THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"Lilo and Stitch is the best movie I had ever seen!!! It's about a girl whose love can transform even a little monster into a wonderful angel. This film has everything you need for a great movie, humor(and A LOT of it), an evil scientist, aliens, a ""special case"" social worker, dancing, surfing, racing, friendship&love. And besides it's all happening in the beautiful Hawaii! A marvelous film for both, adults and kids."
3,Not for little kids!,"I read the reviews and was eager to get this for ourselves and our two small sons. Parts of the film are wonderful for a small child, but there is altogether too much anger and violence and suspense. I was disappointed in the ratio of quiet / character-developing scenes to oppositional / threatenting / chase scenes. Yes, on the spectrum of movies today it is better than most - but it will have to wait another two years before I will share it with my 3-year-old. (I recommend _My Neighbor Totoro_ for small kids - there is emotional stuff but not too strong.)"
1,Repackaged and misleading !!,"These 7 songs are the exact same as DISC 4 of the MC5's ""Purity, Accuracy"" boxed set. Why not save SIX DOLLARS and get all six discs instead of one?! Come on Get Back and Abraxas record companies, tricks are for kids."
4,Exciting production. Could even be 5 stars.,"I had picked up this in preparation for our Chorale group's performance of the Magnificat, and Wachet Auf. I had also picked up a Deutsche Grammophone recording of the same two pieces, which seems ponderous by comparison. My conductor made the observation (with which I agree having listened to both recordings), that bringing the tempo up a bit from what is in the score (tempo markings are by the publisher, not Bach) brings the music up another notch in energy and emotion, probably closer to Bach's intent. (I don't have enough listening experience to be comfortable awarding anything 5 stars.)"
3,Why did I buy this book?,"I bought this book years ago and just got around to reading it. It's the novelization of a Dr. Who spinoff. It's adequate, such as it is, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than fans of the show."
3,What happened to the illustrations!!!?,"One of Van Gulik's better efforts in the ""Judge Dee"" series, but seriously flawed by the almost entire omission of Van Gulik's original illustrations. Since I have seen previous and subsequent volumes published by the University of Chicago which do contain the drawings, I have no idea why this curious dearth exists. Judge Dee fans, be warned; there are two other volumes in the series which likewise are lacking this important story-telling device."
4,Entertaining with lots of twists!,"When I started this book I thought ""What the hell's going on?"". The first few paragraphs appear to be about a man who is haunted by some malicious force, perhaps spirit. Then it turned into a quite good detective story and the ""haunted"" man had disappeared and never made a comeback.... how strange?The detective story is quite entertaining with lots of little twists and turns that keep you rolling along. The supporting characters are fun and have their own adventures whilst engaged in the investigation but it is Judge Dee who lies at the core of the story. He's investigating a murder that has taken place on board a boat in the middle of a lake, almost under his nose! The number of suspects is obviously limited, but it is not easy to get at the actual culprit. Then a series of, shall we call them misadventures?, misadventures occur that slightly sidetrack Judge Dee... yet they also appear to be connected....Jolly good. I'd read another."
3,Playboy:Girls of Hawaiian Tropic,"This is a sexy video,BUT I thought it would be like the other ""Girls of Hawaiian Tropic"" Video series. The none Playboy tapes,They are the ones based around the Hawaiian Tropic pagents.I like the fact that we see a lot of fresh girls in such provocative situations.It's fun, like being there with them.I really feal like I am getting more of my money's worth with the Other""Girls of Hawaiian Tropic""series."
4,Great teases!,"The girls are just average in this video, but some of the teases are just incredible! Very, arousing. Warning! Sung-Hi Lee is a BIG disappointment in this video; she has no presence at all. Buy this if you like Playboy videos."
1,Hunk of crap,The screws used to adjust the gain broke off with very little force applied from my eyeglass screwdriver. What the hell. I can't believe I actually had to wait for this hunk of crap to arrive.
1,Crappy piece of plastic,"I have no doubt in my mind this product would have worked fine BUT the first time I adjusted the gain on the converter, the small dial broke off! The gain dial wasn't under any kind of ""extreme pressure."" It just broke off way too easily which showed me just how pathetic the construction is on these things.I ended up going back to my original choice for LOC's>>[...]This other LOC doesn't look as pretty but is much more durable and trustworthy in terms of construction. Save yourself the frustration I went thru and just buy this other LOC instead.Cheers"
5,real good,Well I got this because I wanted to keep my stock headunit . I installed my line out converter to my speaker on my back top deck of my car. I stiripped the wires and krimped them together with the line out converter so it is a secure connection and I lugged the RCA's to the other side of the converter to my amp. Worked very well. Subs sound amazing and my stock headunit looks a lot better then an aftermarket. 5 star product. Great buy. Very easy installment
5,Easy set up,"It has four wires to left and right rear spaekers that converts into RCA output. That's it, easy to use has gain control on RCA output worked great."
5,Amplifier without an RCA subwoofer plug,"If you want to connect your amp. through the speaker outlets, to a subwoofer that connects via an RCA plug, you will need this.It works.Anything that works is great!"
5,Just GREATTTT!!!,"This thing is the best!Good sound quality( not distortion, not noise,...).-I got the same amplifier and speakers like a friend and he has a aexpensive car radio and the music sound the same in my car!-Easy to install-The only cons is the convertor is taking power from others speakers, i have it hook up to the rear speaker and the front speaker sound a little low. I am not sure if a setup everthing correctly, but if i can fix this problem ill update this review!For me 5 stars! You save a big money and keep thieves away from your car."
5,Works great for new Pioneer radio in 2003 Matrix,This was the right size to convert between the Matrix antenna plug and the Pioneer radio input. Too bad I didn't know I'd need to get this before I took the radio out...
2,Conversion tip,The tip was suppose to be compatible to my car but still didn't fit on the antenna so I did not work for me.
1,No lesson learned here.,"This book is not for those who prefer a book that enriches a child. The wolf wants to make some pancakes and asks for help from his good fairytale neighbors, but they all slam the door in his face. The wolf then realizes he has to do it himself. Through hard work and determination he ends up making a batch of delicious pancakes himself (fantastic character development). The neighbors smell the pancakes and demand to have some. Thus, the wolf invites them in and ends up eating his neighbors and the pancakes. I don't find this very humorous or funny at all."
2,Rude People Deserve to Die?,"My father bought this book for my three-year-old daughter on the recommendation of a bookstore staffer. The illustrations are nice, and I understand the point about not being rude, but, um... everyone is eaten by the wolf in the end. There's no softening of the fact that he ate all the rude people up and still had room for pancakes. And the moral is...? Don't be rude, or the predators among us will have a right to kill you? This is one odd book."
5,Comfort food is found!,"""Trattoria Cooking"" inspires and delights. The recipes are accompanied by stories of their origins, alternative serving suggestions, wines hints...all in all, an approach to the cooking experience that let's the reader feel comfortable. Great flavors abound inside the cover.A small word of caution needs to be offered. Beware those of you who are calorie conscious. This book is not moderate in its results. Your grandmother's grandmother would be proud of these recipes. You will want to eat more of this wonderful stuff."
4,"Sound delicious, work inconsistently","""Trattoria Cooking"" reveals the simplicity of Italian home cooking. Unfortunately some recipes work better than others. The recipes could have been tested and refined a bit. However, you CAN have success with the recipes the book gives you if you're willing to experiment and not take every recipe at face value. But experimentation and refinement is a big part of cooking, isn't it? Biba's wine recommendations for each dish are very helpful aspect of the book for those of us who aren't wine experts. Get ""Cucina & Famiglia"" before you buy this one."
4,good book,I have an extensive collection of Italian cookbooks and this is a good one. I recommend it to anyone interested in learning a few new Italian food dishes to whip up at the next family gathering.
2,Grammatical flubs make it a tough read,"While the author deserves credit for his endeavor in this rare inside look at Niazov's Turkmenistan, the overt misuse of grammar throughout the book makes this almost impossible to read. For example: ""wary of England's designs and xenophobic, the Russians outright closed Turkmenistan when they took it under control in 1881."" ""...about which T.E. Lawrence might have romanticized."" Awkward phrasing like this is a constant throughout the book, which would be much improved with a thorough editing - perhaps in a later edition?Additionally, Kropf's lengthy descriptions of long plane flights and jet lag are for the armchair traveler rather than the road warrior. Some of the ""gee whiz, I work in a U.S. Embassy now"" anecdotes sound tired to anyone who has actually been there. For a first-time Turkmenistan reader (and hey, there are a lot of those), this is a worthwhile read."
5,Terrific! Makes you think twice about every sneeze!,"WOW!!!! I can't say enough good things about this book. It is simply extraordinary. If you're contemplating buying this book, but are scared away by the 1100+ pages, don't be. I read it in a little over a week. It's so good that you find yourself only wanting to read it, and not do anything else. I thought that just the premise of rebuilding after a super-plague wipes out 99.4% of the population was interesting enough. Then the whole good vs. evil bit just expands the story. This is one of the few novels I've read where I found myself wondering just what I'd do if I were faced with the same situation. This is the best book you'll ever read. BUY IT NOW!!!!"
4,"A great read, albeit with one slight problem","The Stand is one of Stephen King's best works, and actually deserves more than 4 stars, but not quite 5. The only major problem I have with the book is how Stephen King seems to lose interest in the characters he has created at times. The book is at its best when there are fewer characters, because King can focus on each character in full rather than lose track of them. The death of one much-loved character (the most unique and best-developed one in the book, in my opinion) seems like a cheap way out, King's way of saying ""I'm tired of figuring out ways to write him into the story. Ho-hum."" The ending is also a bit of a copout, but still works pretty well. Just as in all of King's other works, he loses steam by the end. The first 850 pages are practically flawless, but his fatigue shows through in the final act. All in all, a remarkable tale that holds up quite nicely, even when it starts to stumble.M-O-O-N, that spells worth your money."
5,Captain Trips Rules,"The best book I have ever read...21 times so far.Isn't this the oldest story ever told? But what a new way to illustrate the struggle between good and evil, what a warning of what might happen if one does not choose the right side to be on when all is said and done. King's characters literally live and breathe on the pages, and are so real, that when friends and I discuss them, others think we are talking about friends whom we have in common. And doesn't King cleverly weave thse characters into our emotions so well that they do indeed become friends and heros and enemies to us?But that is what Stephen king does, steps right into our living rooms (or wherever we read our treasures) and engages us for a time, pulling us into his incredible worlds adn then releases us changed; we have different ideas, new people in our lives, and maybe, in the case of The Stand, new warnings to heed."
3,Mixed feelings,"As with any other novel, ""The Stand"" has its ups and downs. The ups centered on the characters (Glen, Frannie, Stu, Harold, Larry, Tom, Nick). I was very drawn to these characters' growth, endurance, and development in the novel. Mr. King deserves a thumbs up for orchestrating and balancing these characters so as to make their interaction engaging for the reader. Much of my enjoyment of the novel comes from the energy that these characters create with their speech, actions, and personality. At times, they seem as real as people I know in my life.The downs rest mainly on the development of the villain, R.F. Quite frankly, he is not sufficiently sinister. I was not frightened by Randall as I was of the evil forces, say in The Green Mile or Desperation. The anticipation of meeting face to face with Randall was great, but after that, the excitement for the evil and carnage that I was hoping for did not materialize."
5,My second favorite all-time novel,"I thought I'd never read an endtimes novel better than Stephen King's THE STAND, which has been a personal favorite for years. But I just finished Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY, and want to share my awe with all King fans. LAST DAY is just phenomenal. It's VERY different. A hugely suspenseful and frightening story, filled with clever plot twists--totally surprising and unpredictable to the end. The conclusion jarred the hell out of me and I'm simply not able to get it out of my mind. If you love King, particularly STAND, you will Love Kleier's LAST DAY. My very highest recommendation."
5,Without a doubt one of the best books ever written.,"J.R.R. Tolkien, Edgar Allen Poe, Clive Barker and any otherwriter of horror and fantasy pale in comparison to StephenKing's masterpiece The Stand. Not only is it a great book,with a chilling plot and characters so real you can almostfeel what they're going through, but The Stand is so scarybecause the events are so realistic that you can't helpbut wonder ""Could this really happen?"" The apocalypticbattle of good versus evil has never been so clearly dis-played as Stephen King has done so with The Stand. Ifyou've never read a Stephen King book in your life, I highlyrecommend you read this one. I can guarantee that once youread this book you will be hooked on Stephen King for life."
5,Worth the LONG Read...,"This is BY FAR the longest book I have ever read. And I read half of it, put it down, and finished it about a year later. But looking back, it's a masterpiece. King builds each character to the point that you feel like you know each individual personally. If you can stick with it for the 1000+ pages, I promise it will be worth your time in the end."
5,An Unforgettable Read!,"I read this book about 20 years ago, and it's one of those stories that has stayed in my mind all these years. I commute by train every day and to this day, whenever someone sneezes or coughs, flashbacks of this story come to mind..I watched the miniseries on TV as well, it was just okay, can't compare to the book. I'm thinking of getting the expanded edition to enjoy it all over again..A MUST READ!!"
2,Unrealistic,"People seem to behave in unrealistic and incomprehensible ways in this book. America's population is virtually destroyed, and people are wandering around aimlessly, in a daze. If this happened in real life, there would be an infinite amount of food, living spaces, vehicles, reading material, and bathrooms. Why is it that people are always walking so much? Why don't they find cars with dead people in them, take out the dead people, and drive? They can get nice Sports Cars! Why do people have to go to the bathroom? There are tons of places to go. Why do people seem to eat junkfood, when there are tons of restaurants and tons of abandoned grocery stores. And why do people bicker about nonsense? Why do people sleep outside when there are tons of available, abandoned houses? The book does not seem to make much sense."
1,A pop-culture rewrite of The Lord of the Rings,"Stephen King is no J.R.R. Tolkien, nor should he try to be.I gave this book one star because Amazon does not offer an option for zero.One final note: Read chapter 25 of So Long and Thanks For All the Fish by Douglas Adams, and you'll have a pretty good understanding of King's writing style. :-)"
2,Much too long and much too boring....,"Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.'I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop.The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot."
1,King Fails this time,"The Shining is his masterpiece.This novel falls way short of that.Ive read most of Kings published works.This novel starts off great,lots of death,destruction and action.A Plague,dead bodies every where- total anarchy.A twisted pyromaniac who burns entire towns to the ground.People breaking into germ warfare buildings-guns murder and suspense.Thats the first three hundred pages- some of his best writing.The next 900 pages are strait out of a Doonesbury comic book- hippies in Colorodo.Town meetings- free love- guitars and the old black woman they worship as a prophet. This book is obviously 800 pages too long.The Shining is his best book- this is not. I cant believe the reviews on this site that say this is his best book!!!"
5,LOVING BOOK BY S. KING,"This is only the 2nd book of Kings I have read. The first was ""Bag Of Bones"". Very good. The Stand is SOOOOO GOOD. Very long and I'm so happy that it is. It's one of the books I don't want to end. Some words I wish he had found a way to omit. I guess he felt they were needed. I don't see the point. A really good writer of books , tv or movies should be able to get the message across with out taking the body of work south. If you over look the Middle School, I got a new DIRTY WORD to try out thrill, you will enjoy this book."
3,5 stars for the first half. 2 stars for the second half,"I loved the first half of the book. Could not put it down. Not so the second half; the writing was still very good, but the plot was trite and predictable."
5,Still Stephen King's masterwork,"Have read this at least 5 times since it first came out, and it's still his richest work. Timeless characters and a true classic of good versus evil - with one of the creepiest villains anywhere in Randall Flagg. A true must-have."
2,"too long, too perverted, bad ending","I did't dislike all of this book. The first, oh, 400 pages in which King describes Captain Trips, the virus that wipes out the human race, was very entertaining. From then on a long, drawn out saga in which every possible phallic event or symbol has to be brought to the reader's attention ensues. I found I cared nothing for the characterss, i found the story ridiculously unbelievable and I thought the ending was a rip-off due to a lack of creativity from King. I like King's work, most notably ""apt pupil"" and ""it"", but this one's a loser."
2,"Long, Boring, and Bloated","I would have given this book only one star except I have too much respect for the author. My first problem with the book is that on Kindle I could only purchase the extended version, which is just absurdly long. There is a reason why books are edited!. For a book with such an intense subject ( a man-made plague that descimates 99% of the population)it is surprisingly mundane at times. A good example is how much space is given to forming an ad hoc committee and whether those people should be on the permanant committee. I mean come on! this is what we discuss at my bicycle club meetings!. While they are discussing whether Harold should be on the committee, hundreds of bodies are rotting in the streets. It just seems too unbelievable. Books this long should be sagas that span years if not generation, not a couple of months in the summer. The time you spend reading this book is certainly not worth the payoff in the end. Sorry Stephen :-("
2,Biggest cop-out ending ever,"I haven't ever had much luck getting through a King book, even the short ones. But I tackled this one because the premise was intriguing (Plague? I'm so there!) and I heard that it was his greatest book. It started out fine and I was feeling pretty good about it. Since I live in Vermont, it was nice to have local places mentioned during the survivors' trip west and the ""local character"" was spot-on. It doesn't happen often! But by the 2/3rds point, I wondered if it was ever going to end, and the subplot of The Kid & The Trashcan Man were indescribably dull. Despite that, I'd probably still have given the book 3 stars but for the utterly CRAPTASTIC cop-out ending. I wish I'd read spoilers, because if I'd known that the seemingly invincible Walkin' Dude would be eliminated in such a feeble manner, I wouldn't have bothered picking it up in the first place. With this book, I've given up on King. Long or short, his books ain't for me."
4,It's all for you,"This is a great novel. Do not be afraid of it because of its size. The Stand and It rank even with my all time favorite reads. This book is a classic struggle between good and evil and it shows so many sides of gray in between. King takes a possible future and a stranger from another dimension, puts them together and gives you one wild ride."
3,"""Would you like fries with that...?""","This is King at his most McCheesiest, and for this I've docked the book three stars. I then gave two stars back for sheer ambition. But then I took another away when I realized that if ambition really counted for anything, Bill Gates would be on the cover of next month's ""Playgirl""...."
5,Best Book I've Read Most of,"I cannot begin to tell you How much I enjoy this book changing my life when I try to read it. It is a difficult read and yet rewarding. I like it. it is warm and good in my head. Stephen King is the greatest artist of our time or any time of ours, that I know of. I like books. Ussually I only read boks about animal detectives, but this book was good anyways."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This has to be one of the most overrated books of all time. There was absolutely no suspense, it was filled with mostly forgettable characters, and it was way too long. I found myself rooting for no one and wishing the book would just end. And end it did, with a big thud. I could not bring myself to despise Flagg, since so little of the story focused on him and and his amazing power. Instead, we have four dull characters headed for Vegas in search of evil. Ultimately, it fails as both a plot driven book and a character study. Laws yes, what a long, dull, pointless pile of trash."
2,The Stand,"Having read the book, twice! I thought that maybe the film would be worth a view. Well it does but I doubt I shall ever watch it again. It follows the book quite closely but the final third loses its facination, probably because up to then you feel that there is some sort of 'maybe it could happen' surrounding it. Like the book it then descends into some sort of God and the Devil fight which is fine if you like that sort of thing but if you don't, well don't buy it. I put up with it in the book but it didn't transfer to the screen very well."
5,One of the best books ever!,"Easily one of the best books I've ever read. Stephen King is so great with characterization. Once you finish one of his books, you know the people in them. They're like neighbors or old friends. This book is one of his better examples of this. It makes me sad to think a lot of people have him pegged as only a horror writer and won't give his work a chance. He has so much to offer."
5,One of the longest (and greatest!) books you'll read...,"What an epic. What a masterpiece! While this novel might take a while to get through, it's totally worth the effort because you get to know the characters very well and fall in love with them. A good ""apocalypse"" story about what happens when a disease kills 99% of the world's population, and a few thousand are left to re-create society. Very eerie, especially during the parts where some of the characters are wandering through the empty cities. Makes you glad to be surrounded by people!"
5,"Read the Stand, if you are not a King fan you will be afterwards","This is the book that I myself and several people I know consider to be ""The consummate KING"" If you say you like King but haven't had the distinct pleasure of exploring this tale then you haven't seen anything yet...The Stand takes us into a post appocalyptic world where good and evil battle for those who remain...Throw in King's Droll wit and sometimes sadist humor and it makes for a very engrossing read. You cannot go wrong with this book..."
2,Bloated,"This book was a gift and my first Stephen King novel. The man can write and, at times, he can deliver some brilliant sentences constructed so simply, yet powerful. His characters in The Stand are a little too predictable and become instant stereotypes, like bad After School Special heroes and villians. About half way through I thought, My God, where's a good editor when you need one? I haven't used my speed reading in a long time, but it came in handy with the severely bloated text. Probably would have been a much more enjoyable journey at about half the pages and some characters that didn't come off as templated."
4,Did you like Under the Dome? Then you'll love this....,"I thoroughly enjoyed Stephen King's ""The Stand"". Having read ""Under the Dome"" first, I was very much after a similar, end of days type book, and this was well and truly the answer. Yes, I do realise that The Stand came first :)This book is heavy on implied Theology, which, being an atheist, I thought I might hate. Luckily, the delivery, and questioning of the characters made the theology more of a non-issue for me.King is a brilliant character writer, inclusive of all the flaws and issues of the individuals.So, sit back and enjoy the 1100+ pages of a very involving story."
5,TRUE HORROR,"The Stand took me months to read, but I loved every minute. Stephen King provides such detail that I knew all the main characters and can remember much about each of them. This book is so wonderfully scary, because of its possibility to come true. This could happen. We (humans) are so curious about finding ways to kill others. I could see this happening, who knows if it is happening right now. The ending was frustrating but could be the opening to a wonderful sequel"
2,Uh-oh....King has become infected,"It wasn't even that King isn't a great author-I love most of his other works, but this one was more of a confused jumble, mixing too many characters with too many differences for you to care about what happened to any of them. The heros whine and whine until you just want them to die. The villains were more interesting. Flagg was, as the other reviews said, pathetic, but villains such as the Kid and Llyod kept the story interesting. Best of all were the parts with the most interesting character, the 'Trash Can' man. Least interesting were the meaningless parts with Frannie and Stu. Many parts of this book are extremely overbloated, the characters are introduced and killed too quickly, and the good characters don't appear much. On the other hand, the villains will keep you rooting for the evil one. How truly sad. If you've read King before, don't read this one, but if you haven't, go ahead and read."
4,"Good, maybe even a classic, but not among King's best","I'm going out on a limb and only giving this four stars because I really don't think it's one of King's best. It is still a really good book, and I dig the whole post-apocalyptic wasteland thing he's got going on. The book even has the makings of a classic, since it's sort of an epic showdown between good and evil, but overall I think it's a little drawn out and boring. The characters are quite well developed and likeable, however, and this is one of the stronger points of the book. I still recommend this book, though I don't think it's King at his best. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
4,One of the very best!,"This is one of King's very best, although I'm not sure the extra padding of the unedited version actually improves the book. If the reader lets go and enjoys the ride (enormous suspension of disbelief is required, especially towards the middle) this is a classic. Harry Shannon's edgy first novel ""Night of the Beast"" is the only book I know of to employ as many horror tropes in such an original and entertaining manner, and although ""The Stand"" lacks NOTB's wry humor it belongs on every afficianados ""booshelf."" King's 'Desperation' and 'It' are almost as good, but not quite."
2,Extra material unnecessary.,"I'd read the original stand when I was 11 and loved it. A few years later I read this and it wasn't nearly as good. The extra material is unnecessary, and subtracts from an otherwise compelling story. The epilogue has the sole purpose of tying in with other parts of Stephen King's books (Randall Flagg = Richard Fannin). Read the original and save some time."
4,Belongs on the sci fi & religion shelves too,"I don't like horror stories and had never read any Stephen King, but a friend recommended ""The Stand"" to me. Like a lot of my favorite science fiction, this is a post-apocalyptic tale. It's set in the U.S. after a virus has killed off most of the people on the planet. This book is more violent and, of course, creepier than most sci fi I read, but it's also much better written. And it's a powerful story of good and evil. Maybe more than any explicitly religious book I've ever read, ""The Stand"" helped me to feel what it would be like to be willing to give up anything, even my life, to combat evil, and it helped me to believe that this willingness is possible for ordinary mortals."
4,"Overall a good book, to too long","Well, I am an avid Stephen King fan but this book just takes too long to get you interested. It drags on and on and on. My advice: watch the damn movie and skip the book."
5,The Most Thought Provoking Book Ever Written,"You will never be able to ignore a sneeze from anyone ever again... this is an awesome book, I have read it 9 times, and I still find it just as exciting as the first time..."
4,Gripping sage of a post,"Like most of King's work the book is much more frightening then the movie. This is a good meaty book for anyone who wants to be scared over a long period of time. The characters are endearing,frighting,sometimes sad but always human. Well some of them are human. If you are a Dark Tower / Gunslinger fan you will see your old friend Randall Flagg in The Stand. Enjoyed this book immensely."
4,An amazing read..,"I'm going to make this first part quite simple, yes this is an incredible book. It is well written, it has perfect characters (both good and bad), and the setting is perfect. BUT..I did love this book. I think that it is Kings best writtin book but it is not my favorite story of his.I rather enjoyed The Shining more, and The Dark Tower will always remain my favorite (especially #3), and the characters, while they are extremely realistic none of them are my favorite King characters.I feel bad saying negative things about this book. And the negative things I do say should not be taken seriously. I just didnt love it as much as everyone else did. But I still consider this book one of my favorite Stephen King books and I will always stay dedicated to Mr. King. So please read this one, you wont regret it."
5,A must read!,"If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, then ""The Stand"" is a must read. To many it sets the bar in this genre, and I would tend to agree. Along with Robert McCammon's book ""Swan Song"" this is the cream of the post-apocalyptic crop. Definitely in my top three favourite books of all time."
2,Long.,"Several people insisted that I give this book a shot. Well, I did and man, I'm disappointed. I'm not a huge King fan to begin with and this read did not improve my opinion on his works.I found The Stand to be long and well... dull. I didn't enjoy it all that much. I know I'm totally in the minority with this review, but that's just how I honestly felt about The Stand."
1,Absolute crap,"I'd go into a long erudite discussion of this book, but it isn't necessary. The 1979 novel originally penned by a great author has been pissed on by somebody, I certainly hope it wasn't Stephen King himself. This book is putrid; it stinks.""The Stand"" in its original format was a brilliant book, written by a genius. The version offered here is a piece of cheap trash unworthy of toilet paper. Do NOT, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES buy this book.Other critics have mentioned the shortcomings of this version in ways I can't improve on. Stephen King is one of our century's greatest authors, ""The Stand"" is one of his greatest books. This edition is absolute crap. Go to ABE Books, buy the original and enjoy it."
3,it good but,I will make this short unlike the book. It good but it is just way too long. He could have easily done the book in 400 odd pages
5,Great condition and great service,This was a great purchase! arrived on time and in excellent condition! Would definately recommend this seller and would do business again! Book is exactly all i thought it would be! Thank You for the great service! Grade A 5 + stars across the boards!
5,Best doomsday story ever.,"I have been reading this book forever. The character development and moral questions are fascinating. Everytime I open it, I learn something new. Pick it up, buy it, dog ear it, bring it home from the library. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY"
3,Interesting read,"As an atheist I found the ending of this book rather terrible. The climax was nothing I expected it to be, but everything was fine until then...I guess if I were Christian I'd probably give the book 4 stars, but oh well."
2,A Good begining that fails to deliver in the end,"After reading the raving reviews given by otherreaders, I must give another side to the story. King's book starts out wonderfully, a disease (Captain Trips) runs rampant throughout the world. Though after the disease runs its course, Stephen King was not able to continue in the course of a good science fiction, he turns to mystical powers and magic to finish his story. The Stand would have been much scarier if there was no magic and based solely on the aftermath and rebuilding of society after the disease. The use of mysticism in his stories only exposes his weakness as a writer."
5,Worth every page.,"The best book I have ever read. It is a bit lenghty to say the least, but worth every minute spent reading it. King is the best at developing characters, and these are his best"
5,Awesome,"I did not think I would like Stephen King books, but I had heard that this one is a classic and I heard right! It is several stories in one and is a battle between good and evil, right here! Although this book was written nearly 30 years ago, it is timeless and powerful today."
3,Less enchanted the second time around,"I picked up THE STAND again last week basically because I had nothing else to read. I buzzed through it my freshman year in high school, lost in the strange world King had created.The second time around, I'm noticing flaws in the picture he paints. A repetetive narrative. Far too much exposition. The irritatingly self-righteous Mother Abigail. Randall Flagg, who sounds like every other villain King has created.Still, THE STAND remains an addictive thrill. Its weaknesses are, for the most part, the same ones you find in all of King's work, as are the strengths."
5,One of my all time favorites.,"I read this book every couple years, it is just the best book ever written I think. Note to others who love this book: did the mass exodus out of NYC on 9/11 walking across the bridges make you think of this novel? When a couple of the characters are trying to get out of NYC? I recommend first time readers try to find a copy of the originaly published edited version. All they seem to have in stores these days is the later released unedited version and there's a lot of extra stuff you don't really need to read unless you're already a huge fan of the book, like myself. So I would hunt down an older copy in a used book store or from the library- I think you will enjoy it a lot more. I hope before I die, and he does, that S. King will write a sequel to this novel. Read it!"
4,Good solid apocalyptic fiction,"I enjoyed this book. It was a quick, easy, entertaining read. It was not the most horrific horror, nor the most apocalyptic apocalypse I've come across, but it also isn't exactly lightweight.I did not expect such heavy Biblical themes, but it is not preachy, narrow-minded, or evangelistic. Instead, it references this material along with science fiction elements in a thought-provoking mix. Good storytelling, interesting characters, and worth the time of anyone interested in this genre. It has some ethical texture and subtlety, but within a fairly clear binary good vs evil framework. Probably not cynical enough for the most existential nihilist fans of apocalyptic literature, and probably too human and nuanced for the most simplistic ""good guys"" vs ""bad guys"" genre fans. But if you're somewhere in between, you'll probably enjoy it."
5,Great read,"I just finished reading ""The Stand"". I thought the book was well paced (even with the slower section in the second half of the book) with great character development. I thought it was a great book overall. The expanded version takes a while to get through but I didn't want it to end. Fantastic!"
3,"Good story, story telling not so good","I haven't read the original shorter version, but while reading this extended version I more than once felt being slowed down by uninteresting details and even repetition. What Hemingway would have conveyed in a single sentence, King feels compelled to write page after page after page, long after the point he wanted to make is completely apparent even to the unobservant reader. There are a lot of pages in this book, but many of them are just filler. It could have been an excellent, climactic, apocalyptic story, but the way this is executed it ends up conveying great scenes interweaved with (a lot of) boring filler."
4,started as one of Kings best but it couldent keep up.,"this book started as one of kings best. When I say started you must understand i mean the first 200 pages,this book is over 1000 pages long.to make this quick all i got to say is this was a good solid book but it easily could of been better.four stars is good (in fact very good) but certain things stoped this from being five stars. great characters, good story, but the best feature was that flagg is the ageless stranger from the dark tower."
5,IT LIVED UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS!!!,"Yet another of King's great stories. Again the characters were relatable, the story was devestating, and the describtions were awesome. If you read one Stephen King book, read this one. It's flawless"
5,My Favorite Book,"My Dad gave me ""The Stand"" for Christmas when I was in 9th grade (in 1992). It took me all two weeks of C-mas break to read it, but it was worth it! This is Steven King's best work ever. I loved learning about every single character in the book--they hopes and dreams and their motivations to taking the different paths that they did. The way King wove together the lives of so many characters is truly amazing and I have never seen its equal. Read this book, you will be so glad you did!Incedentally, I am now a junior in college but every December during C-mas break, I pick up the book and read it again. As I grow older, I continue to see something new in the story every time! It is that good!"
5,Best book ever,This is my all time favorite Stephen King book! I have worn out several copies reading and rereading it. The characters in this book are extremely well developed and the plot takes many unexpected twists and turns.Definitely read the complete uncut version. It is worth the extra time it will take you.I can't praise this book enough!
5,THE STAND IS SIMPLY BRILLIANT,"It is my firm belief that Stephen King has produced thus far in his career four literary masterpieces (and another half-dozen or so which come pretty close): THE SHINING, THE STAND, MISERY, and, most recently, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. (Of those that come close, I'd include 'SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE, DIFFERENT SEASONS, PET SEMATARY, DOLORES CLAIBORNE, and THE GREEN MILE.) THE STAND captures virtually every human emotion possible, intensely rivaling, I think, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS for the spot of King's most poignant book. It shall one day, I think (or at least hope), be taught in universities and regarded as a veritable American classic."
2,Very slooooowww moooving...zzzzzzzzzz!,"I read the very first version of this book, and thought it was long. Especially when it took me 3 months to get through it. I kepted putting it down because it was so boreing in many parts. Then I found out he added more to an already to long book. I thought there is no way I'm going to read this book again just to see what other tripe he added. He should have gotten rid of the first two-thirds of the book and keep the rest."
3,Great story but ...,"This book is well written and a great storyline, but it was hard for me to stay focused at times."
3,I was really expecting more...,"So this is supposed to be one of King's best books. I don't get it. I love Stephen King and so many people had talked it up that I thought it would be epic. It was definately my least favorite book of his. I got about 3/4 through it, and finished it 4 months later. The middle just dragged on and on and on and on! Maybe I won't buy the extended editions of anything anymore! Sorry Stephen, just my opinion!"
4,I am a Spider Robinson Fan,"....I also like Stephen King too. His short stories scare me, the novels tend to end with the reader hanging. Much in the same way The Stand does. you thought you were done with Randdel Flag when the bomb goes off, but he comes back.I read The Stand, i watched the mini series, yet, as one revewer said ""it leaves you underwhelmed at then end"". The end of the world sounds like a great story. unfortunately it is the begining of the story and that lead to some great promise. I have never seen Stephen King go downhill from a begining that strong before.Don't get me wrong, it is still a great book and there is great charactor development in it. just he climaxed early and then went flat.If you want a great book that will leave you hanging until the end, Read Needful Things, by King"
5,Great book,This is one of Stephen Kings best books I like all his books. I read it several years ago and this one has more content that was left out of the original.
5,The Stand,One thing i have to say about the stand is it is the most controversial book i have ever read. i read all kinds of books and this one grabbed me and wouldn't let go.i praise mr. king for his masterpiece for it opened my eyes and told me not is always what it seems to be.i love this book and give it my highest approval.
2,Loved the original version but...,"I thought the Original Stand was a great book. Then I read the unedited copy.Yikes.This is the reason editors were invented.As an example, the scene with Trashy and Elvis-guy and a gun. And a violation. Seriously?"
3,Too Expanded Edition,"There's some great writing here, of places, people, and a very believable meshing of reality and fantasy.And yet after a while it gets a bit boring, especially in the middle section. There's doesn't seem to be enough story to justify 1000+ pages. Perhaps the original version was better since this one could certainly do with 200-300 pages of trimming.There's not an awful lot of originality in the story, and the bad-guy is actually rather disappointing. The book ends well, but then carries on for another 100 pages!"
1,Horrible!,"Well to be honest, I'm a big scardy cat so I usually stay away from horror and thus Stephen King. However, after reading The Passage by Justin Cronin and the recommendations of others I was quite excited to read The Stand. Oh, how I wish I had not bothered. The constant referrals to songs and poetry, lots of drivel about too many characters... I just couldn't follow the story and where the plot was taking me. I have always finished a book I set out to read... I just can't finish this one. It's a shame but 3 days of reading and wondering to myself ""this has got to go somewhere soon!"" just got too much. Oh we'll not too long until The Twelve arrives. I can wait until then ;)"
1,Did I read the same book as everyone else???,"I read this in its entirety, and all I can say is I hated it. First of all, the book is way too long, and unlike ""It"", progresses at a slow, boring pace. Also unlike ""It"", the ending is entirely predictable, so I had to read through 800 pages just to reach a conclusion I already knew would happen. Of course, if you're the sort of person who likes predictable endings, then by all means buy this book. If you're more into edge-of-your-seat excitement, steer clear of ""The Stand"". Read ""The Mist"" instead."
1,YAWWWN,"I could not finish this book. I got to 800 or so and simply could not go any further it was dragging on and on. I still do not understand how people can find this book so wonderful, nor Stephen King. I like very few of his books but if you insist on reading his work I reccomend The Green Mile or The Regulators (written as Richard Bachman)"
1,have not received the order to rate,"I am very dissapointed with Amazon because as of today I have not received this order. I am told another is on the way, but have not received it yet. this was a christmas present for my dad, which he did not get. I have ordered before and never had a problem. Very upsetting."
2,Could Have Been Great,"I haven't read the original version, only the expanded one, so maybe my thoughts are one track...but...after many years, I finally picked up a copy of this and after hearing many good things, was looking forward to it. I was very disappointed. The novel started well, I liked the descriptions of the spread of the plague, etc. Very scary.But then it pretty much fell apart. Most of the characters weren't likable, especially some of the main ones like Fran, etc. The main powers, Mother Abigal and Randy Flagg, where extrememly boring and anti-climactic. I can't see how Flagg is often referred to as the ""best villain in Kings stories."" He was nothing. And the climax of the book....yawn.Overall this was a very long book that had potential, but then basically went nowhere. Very disappointing."
3,Not a strong 3 star either!,"NUTSHELL: I was not VERY impressed with this book. It was VERY LONG (now see why shorter versions are available). It was not bad, but to me it never really seemed to pick up! In all honesty, I might have been easier on this book had I not heard so many people claim it was King's masterpiece. Not a bad book, but not very exciting in my opinion. 5 outta 10MORE DETAIL (no spoilers): I have heard time and time again that ""The Stand"" was when Stephen King peeked..etc, etc. I do not think that it was bad, but I really do not see what all the hype was about. The characters are unforgettable like in most King books, but once I really thought the ball was going to start moving it never really built up momentum. I might be being a little hard on this book because I had heard it talked up sooo much. Every once in a while I come across a movie, song, or book that everyone loves, but I just dont get.. :/ Unfortunately, the Stand was one of those for me."
3,Failure to Format / Kindle Version,I love this book and have read it a dozen times in the past 10 yearz. I was so excited to download onto my Kindle2...but there are formattingn and spelling errors on every page. Very jarring and distracting. It is only because I know this story so well that I am able to read it and not remove it from my Kindle in frustration. Hope Amazon has a replacement / corrected version soon.
5,Frighteningly Possible,"A believable tale with realistic people and places, yet it mixes in the supernatural forces of good and evil. As any good story should, The Stand hijacks you from cover to cover. You'll find yourself wondering who people are in your daily life for a while during and after reading this. When I finished the book it stayed with me for weeks. Seeing a dog in the park was a big deal. Hearing someone cough gave me the chills. Enjoy.From Mark John SternalAuthor of ""GUITAR: Total Scales Techniques and Applications""""GUITAR: Probable Chords""""Complete Guitar By Ear"""
3,it good but,I will make thi short unlike the book. It good but it is just way too long. He could have easily done the book in 400 odd pages
2,Deus Ex Machina,"Great story...until the end. I feel cheated.Look up ""Deus Ex Machina."" I think the term ought to be changed to ""The Stand."""
3,Read the original version first,"If you ever intend to read The Stand by Stephen King, do not, I repeat, do not start with the 1990 complete and uncut edition. The original 1978 publication is 823 pages and is the one the fans fell in love with. This version, the one I'm reviewing, is more or less King's original (unedited) manuscript, clocking in at 1153 pages, and holy cow does it drag in the middle.To the reviewers who claim the first and last 200 pages are all you need to read: I'm inclined to agree. To the readers, and there are many, who started with good intentions and gave up somewhere in the 523-page middle called Book II: I feel your pain and suspect you are smarter than me for knowing when enough is enough. If you do decide to muscle through to the end, I'm happy to report the last portion, Book III, is classic King and a pleasure to read."
5,An epic novel,"The stand is the largest book i have ever read yet it was one of the greatest. It is the basic struggle between good vs evil. You will not be able to but this book down, you will want to know what happens to all the characters. It is a must buy"
5,The Stand By Stephen King,Stephen King beyond any doubt is the best writer I have read. The Stand Has to Be the best book ever written by King.When You Sit down and read this book you will be stuck there reading it until it is finished. By the time you are done reading it you will feel you have been there.So read the stand and be amazed...M-O-O-N that spells The Stand....
5,Favorite,This is my favorite Stephen King novel. It has a bit of everything. My paper copy has been read so many times and is dog eared and taped together. I'm so excited to have this on my Kindle now.
5,Best of the apocolypse novels ever written,Living just 12 miles from Boulder this story holds me closer than others. So well written. Great character development. Much easier to understand than some of SK's other books.
4,Standing High,"Stephen King's ""The Stand"" is a novel in the same vein as ""Lord of the Rings"". Taking place after a devastating plague has wiped out half of humanity, two groups on opposing sides of the Rockies must vie for command in the shambles of America. This version of the book has added ~400 pages of additional material, which given the ~800 pages in the original is not entirely warranted. I found the writing to be very functional, quite adept at telling the story but sometimes a bit plain. Despite this once the ball gets rolling and the forces begin preparing themselves for the titular Stand, I was unable to put the book down until I finished the last 300 pages."
5,Absolute Masterpiece from the Master,"This is a masterwork from the modern master of fiction. From start to finish you will be not able to put the book down..it is that good. If it didn't have such dirty language throughout it would be taught in classic literature classes for high school students. IMO it blows such classics as ""Brave New World"" ,""1984"" ,""The Grapes of Wrath"" out of the water. If you haven't read this book, even if you have a negative opinion of Stephen King's other books, pick up a copy of The Stand and be prepared to be blown away."
5,Nothing but incredible,This book was so fascinating and great. It just makes you think about what you would really do and which side you would be on. I love mind stimulating pieces and this is definately one of those. I really suggest this piece of work if you want to be intruiged too.
3,Vivid descriptions but too self-indulgent,"Mr. King has a talent for vivid descriptions and dialog. However, the book would have been much improved in my opinion had he worked with an editor that limited the author's tendency to indulge in flights of prose for prose sake. Had the author disciplined himself to serve his story and not his fancy, I would probably have enjoyed this more."
3,DISAPPOINTING! - referring to the uncut edition,"The book was totally disappointing and I am yet to find the WONDER of this story. To be honest, it was, in my opinion, extensively overrated. The storyline is great though, a superflu that destroys over half the world's population and leaves a few surviors to battle on. Yet strangely, I found it very hard to warm to any of the characters, maybe because they were too plain or uninteresting(?), I don't know. Not Stu, not Fran, not Harold and not even the religious old woman , who is apparently responsible for saving mankind. Simply put, the story was too long and drawn out, there was an excess of unnecessary information that endlessly bored me and left me wondering when the story was going to move on. Is this the 'supposed' BEST Stephen King book, the much talked-about novel that everyone DEFINITELY had to read? I was GREATLY disappointed and still cannot understand why people continue to rate such a grossly exaggerated story."
3,"If you read the first version, save your money","I'm a King fan, and despite the fact that I'd read ""The Stand"" (multiple times, actually) I ran right out to get this book. In the introduction, King makes a statement that ""some will view this as an act of vanity by an author who can do whatever he wishes."" After reading both versions, I can honestly say this is a true statement. His editors did him a favor the first time around and this is not an improvement over the first version. If you've read the first ""Stand"" save your money."
3,And painted in THIS corner...,"As with IT, King has taken an engaging set of characters and some nicely established tension and fumbled at the end. The detour into the supernatural did nothing for the book; the story was more compelling when it centered on the effects of the disease. The supernatural did not add to the tension in the book, nor did it help convey any compelling philosophical points. Read The White Plague by Frank Herbert to see how it should have been done."
5,Oh YEAH!,"It's been awhile since I've read this, but the fact hasn't changed that it's my favorite book ever. When you meet the characters, you begin to really know them, and start thinking you know them. They are the most memorable characters ever created... Stu and Frannie, Harold, Nadine and so on. Beware though- when you're reading this, make sure that when you're not actually reading this, that you can distinguish between real life and ""The Stand"" life... you'll think about it all the time!!!!"
5,Epic,Is there really anything I can say about this book that hasn't already been said over the years? This book has been a staple in my collection for nearly 2 decades now and I was more than happy to add it to my Kindle collection. Perhaps one of the single greatest stories ever written.
5,Missing pages in Signet Edition,"Everyone knows how much I love Stephen King and the Stand-- I devoted a whole issue of Midnight Graffiti magazine to the man. I bought this paperback when it came out in 1991, dying to read the unabridged version of my favorite story! Imagine my horror when I got to Book One (it starts at Hap's Texaco when Charles Campion is about to plow into the pumps) and I turn the page only to discover that the text skips 2 pages!! I ran to look at my sister's copy (we're both fans) and sure enough, she bought the same edition and it was also missing 2 pages. I don't want to order another one to see if it was just that particular printing (the 30th) or if the error continued through the 40+ reprints of the unabridged edition.Anyway--fantastic book, an epic reality based dark fantasy classic. A must read for all fans of the genre and, next to the Dark Tower, his masterwork. Just check the pages first!"
5,the best King novel,"I couldn't put this one down. Good vs. Evil at it's most fascinating best. The end of the world as we know it after disease kills off most of the population. The ""good"" gravitate to each other and the ""bad"" do as well. What happens next is thought provoking, scary and surreal. The characters are rich and believable. This is truly one of those books where the book was so much better than the movie. Had me thinking for days after I finished. Thumbs up!"
5,Very long book worth the time. EXCELLENT READ,This book is of course a classic in Stephen King writings. Excellent read and worth every hour and penny spent!
5,THE BEST!!!,"I am an avid reader, and I can honestly say that until the day I die, this will always be my all-time favorite book. I am not a Stephen King fan, and I had only read half of one of his books before this one. For those of you out there who say ""I don't like horror books"", you HAVE to read this book. It's not horror, it's about humanity. Everyone should read this book!!! It was about 5 years ago when I read it, and I'm getting ready to read it again."
2,Bad quality- paper too thin!,"Started reading it, but the quality of the book is terrible. The paper is too thin, the pages are almost see-thru. Ick. I can't stand it. I suppose that's what you get when you buy cheap! I am going to go buy it in hard cover somewhere else and try again. The book will be great, I'm sure. I just can't stand the quality of the printing. Even the type is small and really close together. Odd."
3,A really good 600 page novel trying to escape from under 500 pages of bleh,"I'll have to find a copy of the original non-extended edition of this book, as the extended version drags and the bits I know were originally cut I wish had stayed cut. (The Kid, I'm looking at you. Honestly WTF.) The revisions to make the setting into 1990 rather than a future 1985 predicted from the late 70s make the time frame of the book seem very muddled and some pop-culture references are artificially modern while others are utterly arcane to readers who weren't alive at the time of first publication. 5-star beginning, no star ending."
1,"Great book, horrible price!",The stand is definitely an enthralling book and one that deserves more than one read. The price on the other hand is horrendous. Why should anyone pay $40.00 for the kindle e-book when the paperback version is only $8.99. This is a flagrant ripoff considering that the e-book is all profit since there is no production cost besides the initial kindle format conversion.
1,Sue the publisher!,"I read this book a while back and I can remember the utter trauma that this book has put me through! In fact, I have still not recovered from it. This book really had all the right elements of becoming a great horror book, but unfortunately Mr King screwed it up. This isn't the first time he did this, I've read Cujo, The dead zone and the half of IT (it was this book that diminished all hope of ever reading a Stephen King book again). Based on my experience of reading King's books, I can predict that his work is not for me. It lacks that rare thing, which I call the scare-factor and I've noticed with The Stand that some of (particularly when the deadly flu spreads around the world) his scenes are very repetitive and, generally, the book is BLATANTLY BORING. The Dark One in the book also disappointed me, because I would've expected it to have more interesting supernatural gifts.In conclusion, this book is more useful as a modified dumbell than it is as reading material."
1,Tl;DR,"King is the King of Sleepiness! LOL. Seriously, I could not fall asleep, so I read this, and I was out like a light. All he does is ramble on about some kind of apocalypse and their flat surviving characters. And where are the zombies?If you want a good read, read the Twilight saga."
5,5.0 stars and worth it!,This is the BEST book written by Stephen King! I've read it twice and will probably read it about ten more times before I die!
1,Not the unabridged version,Really disappointed that this was an abridged version of the text that Stephen King had to edit out 400 pages. The last book (book 3) just barely held water and I ended up ordering the unabridged book in paper form and I'm looking forward to rereading the last book.
1,Slurry,"Like a bad bout of diarrhoea this book never seems to end. Luckily at over a thousand pages it's handy if you have diarrhoea. I can't believe anyone hurled it 18 metres, the best my friends and I could manage was 10.5 It's also handy for getting a good nights sleep. Just take two pages and wake up in the morning. I always find that when reading about characters I wish would just die. I wish I knew which book all these five-star ""best book EVER"" people have read as I'd go and buy it. It can't be The Stand can it ? Surely not."
1,Will it ever end?,"I know I am in the minority but I did not like this book. The plot was ok, but by dragging it out over 1100+ pages King made it a labor to read (like many of his other works). A man with King's talent could have easily condensed the book to 400-500 pages and not detracted from the story. Reading parts of The Stand was like watching grass grow, but it did put me to sleep many of nights. I think if Stephen King and Tom Clancy would get together they could produce a 3000+ page novel which would be a #1 bestseller and cure insomnia. By the way I expect this review to get trashed by King's beloved followers (Not to mention Clancy readers)."
5,A long but easy read,"So hard to put down, King tells a great story. I would suggest reading the book before watching the mini series, although that was well done as well."
3,Way too long (I should have known),"Just by looking at this book you can see that it is incredibly long. My version is about 1150 pages. So I knew that I'd be getting into a very long reading project. But the book is so long that it is a tedious read. I read for fun, not torture. The story is good. Very good. But there is so much stuff written into this book that can be cut. (I probably should have read the abridged version, but then I'd always wonder what I missed)Another thing that biased my opinion is that I've seen the movie already. Most of the time when you see a King film then read the book, it's like they are two entirely different stories. But not in this case. The movie is really a great adaptation to the book, so I didn't feel like I added anything to The Stand by reading it.The bottom line is that this book is just TOO MUCH. It is too long. Too time consuming. And too boring. I had to put this book down many times before finally finishing it."
3,Why all the hype...,"As for a love/hate relationship- I LOVED Dolores Claiborne and hated Bag of Bones. Now I pick up my 3rd Stephen King novel and having read all the earth moving stellar reviews I darn near feel like I am cracking the bible. I got to about page 370 and it started to become a chore to read..and I thought "" and I have 800 more pages to go!""...I threw it down and moved on to something else. NOT King, I just may be done w/him. For the love of heaven I just don't see why all the devoted admiration so many have for this book. Really ?"
3,Unfortunate,"Purchased this book as a present. Some pages at the back of the book were bent, as well as a corner of the back cover. Overall it was alright and won't affect reading, but was disappointed that a new book was banged up like this."
5,The Complete Stand.,"This version of ""The Stand"" (as the introduction by the author specifies), is an expanded version of the original, published in 1978. So you could say this is the version Mr. King originaly intended but was forced to rescale because of publication hassels.With that in mind, this was still a hell of a bargain, for me even though I already owned a paperback edition of the same book. What I found, was that this version simpley expanded on the already existing characters and events without changing anything drastically.Apart from ""The Shining"" this book is one of the best of Mr. Kings work to date. But bewarned, this edition is a bit long and therefore there are some parts that may feel a bit bland but overall, the urgency and the feeling of impending doom still persists throughout."
4,Hmm..,"An author accustomed to being under a center spotlight like Stephen King would usually have one day, his dream of writing a long novel of apocalyptic scope. He realized this dream when he produced The Stand. All throughout it must be said the book is a masterpiece of darkness. However, nothing is flawless. How about the several hundred pages of ad hoc committees written in the diary of Frannie Goldsmith? That is plain boring, in my opinion. Not relevant in the leastest to the story. Not wishing to be unkind or anything, but then, how about the ending? Talk about far-fetched!! Deus ex Machina to the rescue! Gee!! That damaged the book's reputation. If that hadn't happened, the book would no doubt have to have been awarded AT LEAST a Bram Stoker award. Mr. King, do us a favor. Write a good novel, but write it all the way through. Dont just let it all go at the end. Your millions of readers thank you."
1,"Not the worst book I've ever read, but close...","The beginning was good, and that made the ending so much harder to take -- like a broken promise. I kept expecting the characters to transcend their destinies and do something unexpected or at least interesting, but they just plowed on like donkeys tied to a mill wheel. And the ending -- after all that build-up, the whole thing is resolved with an accident?!? This is exactly the sort of deus ex machina ending that would get you flunked in undergraduate writing classes."
1,"1,141 pages of sheer boredom.","Well it's true what they say...the book's always better than the movie. This should only indicate how bad the movie was since this 1,141 page bore-a-thon has absolutely no redeeming characteristics except that it does eventually end. Unless you're in jail and have virtually nothing else to do, don't read this book."
4,steven king at his best,"well i got screamed at by my mom for reading this book.she found out it was longer than the bible and got really fired up saying i shouldve read the bible.anyhow,the plot is simple.a doomsday plague is released killing near everyone.everyone left either gave visions from this old chick or a weirdo.its like the ultimate showdown between evil and good.............well thats what you are led to belive in 1800 plus pages of agonizingly meticulous details.then the end comes and it really sucks.i personaly think he had a deadline to meet or something and cut the book short.its hard to put down but its got its faults."
1,don't waste your time,"This is was my first Stephen King novel and it will certainly be my last. I'm not sure why so many people recommend this book!To begin with, King takes 3 pages to explain something that he could have said in a sentence. To make matters worse, most of the details that he spends an ardously lengthy amount of time on are pointless. It is disappointing because the concept for the story has so much potential. Relative to other long books that I have read such as Les Miserables and War and Peace, The Stand is a simplistic and bland novel. The characters - who are all rednecks - as well as the plot of the story are completely uninteresting. To top it all off, the ending will leave you even more unimpressed. Overall, a terrible book."
3,Amazed,"I like the storyline of Stu and Fran while they were traveling to Boulder.All in all it was a good read, I did enjoy it."
5,Among the best King/post-world book(s) ever written,"When I was younger, I didn't like to read as much as I liked to watch movies. I fell in love with The Stand when it aired on TV back in the mid 1990s. I've always been a fan of King, but never really read much of his material because it's so long. However, I've always wanted to read this book because of the movie. There's even more description in the book!--which is like watching an extended version of the movie again! If you like the movie, you will love the book. Of course, like all King's books, there are parts that add nothing but dribble. There is one chapter (I can't remember which one it is, but it was NOT in the movie) that simply BLEW me away. I do recall it was the after effects of the world coming to its end. People either killed themselves off accidentally or died in strange ways because they couldn't care for themselves any longer. Anyway, this is highly recommended! I don't believe you will be disappointed."
3,"M-O--O-N spells Okay. Laws, yes!","What I expected: The ultimate horror novel, something that would give you nightmares as long as you read it and would haunt you for the rest of your life. The ultimate story of good versus evil. The darkest, most terrifying piece of fiction ever written. What I got: The first part where Captain Tripps kills everyone off moved at a really fast pace. After that, it slowed down a bit. The committee meetings were too long. I want horror, not politics. There was no part in this book that really scared me. Shocked me, sure, but not scared. The ending was a real let-down. It just happens so fast that you feel cheated. I read several hundred pages for THIS! The end-end was sorta confusing. What happened? Beats me. Overall this is an okay book, not as tightly constructed as some of King's other works. Some of the characters in here are really good. Laws, yes! It could use an editing job."
2,Not So Hot!,"As with most authors, More is not necessarily better. Stephen King grinds out a meandering tale which I've been unable to finish (as yet!) Other books I've purchased from Amazon for my Kindle are taking precedent over this, at least so far."
3,"Great characters, artificial plot","For the first 350 pages or so, I really liked this book. The characters were rich, varied, and had intense relationships, and the crisis was harrowing. It disappointed me that all the characters involved in the intense relationships were dying, but I still liked the book.Then, boat heels clocking along the blacktop, then came The Walkin' Dude. Suddenly I realized Stephen King was introducing the ""big bad dude"" along with the plot. Suddenly I realized it sucked.The bad guy is pretty much a flop, and the entire plot is terribly artificial; all the important decisions and actions are made because of a sort of divine gun to the back. And for me, the idea of blindly following anything is evil.Still, I liked the book, and if you're interested great character portraits delving deep into the human psyche (Harold) then you could do worse than The Stand."
3,Read the shorter version,This book has been sitting in my office for almost two years now. I finally took it down and started in on it. I can see why some of it was cut !! Some parts just DRAG !!!! I have seen the movie and it was very good and so was the book all in all. I would still recomend it but do not waste your time on the longer version.
3,was paperback not hardcover,"ordered a hardcover but the seller sent a paperback, i was ordering a hardcover for my son because his eyes aren't as good as they used to be and he can't afford to go get glasses this book will do only because it's larger then the paperback he already owned"
5,Perfect Condition,This book is everything I had hoped it would be. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
4,Story telling vs writing,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, it's actually the first Stephen King book I've ever read, and I can see why he is so popular, he's a masterful story teller, the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because while it is a wonderful story, it is not necessarily the best writing I've ever encountered, and I don't think I will be seeking out any other Stephen King novels any time soon."
5,Get this book,"amazing story, changed my life and my outlook on the world, can't say enough good things about the story. get it now"
5,My favorite book of all time,"I've been reading since I was a kid, and have read hundreds of thousands of books. The Stand is my all time favorite. This is the best book I have ever read"
4,the stand,A little monotomous and long but otherwise a great book. Loved it from start to end. Must read if your a Stephen King fan.
3,NOT QUITE UP TO STANDARDS,"I am a big fan of King's, but this story got me going halfway before my interest tapered off. I barely finished the book with my own free will. Reason? This is one of the longer books in history, where the action doesn't flow in subtle pulse, as in ""IT"" (by the same author), nor as fast as an action thriller. This is more of a philosophical book at points, which although is not bad in itself, makes it kind of dull. However, it does have a few redeeming points."
4,The best work among numerous duds,"Stephen King is entirely overrated as an author. I devoured his books in junior high and high school, and that's about the level of writer he is. He is very good at what he does, which unfortunately is recycle and regurgigate a good novel in fifteen different forms annually until it degenerates into pure garbage. That said, this is the one work that stands out above the rest. The level of character development, if not higher, is much more interesting than in his typical works, as is the entire grandiose concept of The Stand. Just the sheer imagination that it takes to write and read something like this makes it worthwhile. It's unreal, but also written well enough to make the reader wonder ""what if"" and give it some element of reality which is necessary to make the work really stand out and grip you. For someone who doesn't read Stephen King, this novel is an exception and worth the effort. For those who do read him, this book outclasses the rest."
5,"His Best,The Best","I just started reading King this summer. The first book I read was ""The Stand""It was a masterpiece. No one can develop characters like King. You feel like you know the people. You love the good guys and you despise the bad guys. My favorite of all time."
5,The best book ever written,"This book is 100% better than the first version of the stand. If you have already read the original version, then this uncut version will answer all the questions you had about each charachter. If you have never read the stand before, this will be the best and most haunting book that you have ever read!!!!!"
4,STEPHEN KING IS A MASTER STORYTELLER,Wow! Stephen King sure knows how to tell a story. The Stand has everything in it that a book could possibly have. Steven King just has a way of you really getting to know his Characters and you turn page after to page to get to know them better and to see whats going to happen with them. The only dissapointment with this book is the ending. Rather short for how lengthy the book was. It is one of his best. (IT is his absolute best.)
5,Why I was put on Earth...,"Wow. That's it. Wow. That one word describes The Stand. I was 14 when I read it. I easily scarfed the 1000+ pages in two weeks. Trust me, you won't be dissapointed. When the book ended, I didn't wan't to let the characters go, because I had been with them on every step of their journey. Simply said, the greatest book I've ever read. If you liked this novel, check out Chricton's The Andromeda Strain. For another of King's good works pick up The Bachman Books or The Talisman. So if you haven't read the Stand, go get it RIGHT NOW!"
5,Timeless masterpiece!,This defines thrillers. The Stand continues to haunt me...since 1978 I have read and re-read this book in abridged and uncut versions at least 10 times! Fabulous! A MUST READ!
3,"Man, what's with that ending???","I'm a huge Steven King fan. I've read Firestarter, Salem's Lot, The Talisman, and now this??? The story begins wonderfully and is so until the last 200 pages of the book or so. A huge, apocalyptic confrontation between good and evil, and how does it end? Flagg (accidentally) creates the perfect outlet for God to use a warhead to blast both the really good and really bad guys from the face of the Earth!!! BORING! why couldn't it be more like Salem's Lot???"
2,On And On And On And On And On......,"This is the real Neverending Story. A real disappointment from Stephen King. His best qualities are all here: his amazing ability to create realistic characters and take us inside their minds, his way with a scary scene, his really great villains.Unfortunately, all of his worst qualities are here too. The pretentiousness, the over-writing for the sake of filling up pages, the too cute characters (If Tom Cullen had told me that M-O-O-N spelled anything again, I was going to throw the book across the room!), and a delusion that he has Something Serious To Say About The Struggle Between Good And Evil.The sad thing is that King really does have something serious to say about the struggle between good and evil. He just says it better in his shorter works like The Shining, Pet Sematary, and Dolores Claiborne. The Stand, however, is just page after empty page after empty page after empty page after empty page."
2,The ending was terrible!,The beginning was good. But it led into a religious heaven and hell war. At the beginning I thought it had potential to make people think about the diseases and chemicals we contain on earth and how dangerous they are. But in the end all it amounts to is divinding the world into worshipers of God and Satan. The outcome of this story could have come about with out there ever being a disease. It sounds like King got a little bored with the story and made a bad end cause he didn't want to write any longer.
5,Masterpiece,"This book is,by far,one of the absolute best books ever writtenby Stephen King! I have read over 35 of his books and this is mynumber one favorite book of all! I love the way he captured myimagination from the very beginning and played on the fear of""what if?"". The book is indeed a very long one,but it is well worth it when you can imagine what the world might be like aftera plague killes 99% of the population and you see what becomes of the last few survivers left. This is a masterpiece of horrorfiction and a must read for any fan of Stephen King.Once you finish this one,read the 1978 version!! An excellent book by anawesome writer!!"
4,A classic- but better cut,"This book is one of those cases where shorter is better. Find the first (abridged) edition, it holds its pace better than this larger uncut version, and loses nothing."
5,Five stars is not enough!,"This is Stephen Kings masterpiece. If you're a Stephen King fan and you haven't read this book, shame on you, and if you're not a Stephen King fan and you haven't read this book, shame on you. This is a classic in American literature. It's more than horror, it's a tale of good versus evil for the ages. You'll think of this book everytime you have a fever and start sneezing. I am still haunted by one particular passage where one of the main characters comes across a young boy who has fallen down a well. This is a definte must read."
5,Amazing Book,"This is the best Post Apocalyptic book I have read yet. King delivers as he always does living up to his reputation of the best novelist in history, in my opinion. A must read for anyone who likes this genre and a challenge to see if it will break into your top 5 all time favorite novels"
5,5 1/2 One of Stephen King's Greatest Works,"The Stand is Stephen King's longest book, but in my opinion it was worth every second it took me to read it.The book basically has two parts, the plague and the stand.The Plague is scary because it without a doubt could happen. The way King makes his people act is very lifelike. After reading this part I kept thinking that it had happened.The Stand is like Revelations, telling about the fight that is comming.The ending is what makes the book so rememberable (I will not say anything else about it).So far this is my favorite King novel. I recommend it to everyone who has the stamina to read it."
5,Mom's shoes!,I bought these shoes for my Mother and she absolutely loves them. She's 91 and wears them all day long and tells me that her feet don't get tired. So i think these shoes are great because my Mother is very hard to please that easily!
2,Size not true,"I ordered my usual shoe size. It was too short and very narrow. I tried to return it, now I have no shoe, and no credit - I was told it was never received back. Very disappointing."
3,boots,"These boots aren't as comfortable as I would have expected for Alpha Burly class boots. This is my first pair of snake boots, but my third pair of Alpha Burly boots.. The size, once inside the boot, is a little roomy...You can't put on two pairs of socks because the throat is tight.. So now I just wear one pair of of thick merino wool socks...even during the summer it is cool. Overall performance is good. not super pleased but good for price"
3,Not one of her best,"Although I love Judith McNaught's work, I did not like this book as much. The characters and the plot were very interesting. However, I did not like the fact, at all, that Meredith had slept with Parker and then Parker sleeps with her best friend, Lisa. This is almost obscene in that, in the end, when they are all best friends, three of those friends have all slept with each other. The picture would have been complete if somehow, Matt had slept with Lisa, so that they would have all known each other intimately."
5,Intriguing.Funny.Touching,Romance are usually sloppy but not THIS. If tender love and care with a mixture of marriage humor. This is for you.
5,GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!,"I read this book years ago, and still remember it. Even now, when I have nothing else to read I skim through it. It's the best book she's ever written. I wish she would keep it up. I haven't read a book from her since that can compare."
5,My Favorite,My favorite book ever. I've never read a book more than once and have read this 4 times!
5,Best book I've ever read..........,"This was definately the best book that I have ever read. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. Once I was finished with it I wanted to read it again. I have read it at least five times now and it continues to be a tear jerker every time. This is an excellent book. I highly recommend it. If you like romances, you'll love this book."
4,"good, but enjoyed perfect better","recently, i read and thoroughly enjoyed perfect by judith mcnaught . . . so i decided to read another book for her, paradise, which contained some of the same characters . . . (the latter was written first; you don't have to read them in sequence, but if you do, you might enjoy them a bit more) . . . at any rate, i liked paradise; however, not nearly as much as perfect . . . it is definitely a ""women's book"" and while i like them at times, this one dragged for me a bit . . . story of a woman who turns to her former lover when her family empire is threatened by a hostile takoever attempt . . . . there's a good ending."
5,A wonderful story,Judith McNaught is a great writer. Paradise contains so much excitment page to page you just can't stop. There is actually a plot with folds of development instead of a mere love story. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
2,Not Very Good,"I was excited to read this book after all of the glowing reviews. I love romance novels about a couple's love that lasts a lifetime. Unfortunately, this story did not live up to expectations. I was taken aback at how quickly Meredith and Matt slept together. They only met each other five hours before! Of course Meredith got pregnant and they entered into an ill-fated marriage. I have no idea what books the other reviewers were reading. I felt no chemistry between Meredith and Matt considering how short they knew each other. Meredith became very annoying after awhile with the anatagonizing relationship with her father. I was expecting the best and instead got a really long book that went nowhere. If you are looking for a romance that stands the test of time and is beautifully written, I recommend Honest Illusions by Nora Roberts. Definitely skip this book!"
2,Not Paradise for Everyone,I LOVE Judith McNaught's historical books so I thought I'd try Paradise due to the average 5 star rating. I just couldn't get into it. Too long winded and a female lead character for whom the world ends when mega wealthy daddy won't pay for University. What does she do? Drives off in a Porsche (which she received for her 16th birthday) rather than do a basic job like waiting tables or cleaning so she can pay for Uni herself (even if she has to do it part-time). Right from the start this book had me off-side and it didn't get any better. Definitely not a book for everyone and I'm afraid it ended up in the garbage. I'll stick to Judith's historical novels.
1,"Dull, boring, lifeless....","I have read tens of thousands of books in my life and never have I voluntarily not finished a work of fiction. A few chapters, a pregnancy, and a marriage in and I threw it aside. The father is horrible, Meredith is unbelievable and boring and Matt is not my idea of a hero. I don't even care what happens to them, so I'm giving the book away. If you're looking for strong, interesting, characters, try another writer."
2,"It would have been ""Paradise""...","It would have been ""Paradise"" if I never would have read this book. I have read every other novel by Judith and I have noticed a certain trend; Judith's historical romance are far better than her contemporary ones. Paradise is just another example of the aforementioned trend. It seems that there is so much detail in the contemporary stories that the romance is lost. So the stories end up bland, not quite like Paradise."
3,"Okay, but not fantastic.","Here's what bothered me the most about this book - it started off fantastic, but took a nasty turn for the worse around chapters 9 & 10. It was so promising, I was totally engrossed in it and couldn't bear to put it down - until chapter 10. I had all these different ideas in my head about what could happen with these lovely characters, but the author took it in a direction that I never expected and it completely took me by surprise and I think it was the wrong choice. If the author could have continued to write the entire book the way she did up to chapter 10, it would have been a classic. I stuck with it and read the entire book, but I was only half-heartedly into it because I felt the author short-changed us by what she did with the storyline."
5,One of my favorites!,This book is long but it's worth the read. It still remains one of my favorite romance novels. I love the characters and the story.
5,BEST book ever!!!,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! This is a book where you can read it again and again and again...My ALL TIME favorite!
1,STRETCHED UNMERCIFULLY,"Inspite of a good and strong storyline, there are atleast 200 pages in the book which were absolutely not needed. The book pulls and pulls till the very end and leaves you wanting for something more from an author as good as Judith McNaught. Her other books are definately much better. The past here is too in depth and the scenes corny at best. A real dissappointment......"
3,Paradise,Received book and was disappointed that the binding of the book was broken. Especially when they said it was new. Overpriced for the condition it was in.
5,Love love love!!,"This was my first Judith McNaught book and I am hooked! I have also read Something Wonderful, it was great also but this one is still my favorite!"
4,4.5 STARS...............,"Once I began reading this book I could not stop. It is the kind of book you are reluctant to put down and cannot wait to pick up again. This book will make you laugh out loud and then move you to tears all in the same paragraph. The chemistry between Matt and Meredith is undeniable; it is almost painful to read the scenes when they are apart. Matt's character is very cavalier, bold, and aggressive whereas Meredith is quite the opposite. Luckily, they mesh well even though Meredith's naivety can get frustrating.My only complaint would be that I thought some parts of the novel were drawn out. I also felt that after about of the way into the story the plot suddenly seemed to be rushed (particularly after Meredith's birthday party).I bought this book based on reviewers' recommendations and I'm very pleased I did."
1,Paradise is not really paradise!,"The heroine has the upper hand toward the hero throughout the book. And I don't believe in unbalanced relationship. I don't know why this book got so many good reviews,actually,I think this is the worst book the author has ever written. I'll still stick to my favorite JM books,like ""Perfect"",""Whitney, My Love"",""Almost Heaven"". Don't waste your money on this one!"
5,Too Good!!!,I am in love with the book. I dont even know how many times i have already read it. And how many more times i'll read it....
3,Good but too many words.,"This was a good story. When Matt and Meredith were together it held my interest. I cared about them. I do believe that the author used too many words to tell this story and that is why I gave it 3 stars. The middle section of this story is too wordy and Long. I was anxious to get to the meat of the story. Also, I felt a lot of anger with Mer's father and found it rediculous that he could get away with his controling behavior. I just wanted to get to the happy ending and get this book over with. I didn't care for how the negative parts were so dragged out. Read Kingdom of Dreams, Whitney My Love, and Until You. These stories are fantastic!!!"
5,This is my favorite novel ever;it gets no better than this.,"I absolutely love this book. Of all romances I have ever read, (and believe me, there have been many) I have yet to find one as perfectly written as this one. Matt and Meredith are perfect for each other in every way. The character development is superb. Even the secondary characters seem like old friends by the end. Judith has yet to top herself on this one (even with ""Perfect"", please don't shoot me because I love it, too *smile*). This is J.M. at her very best."
5,Paradise,"This book leaves me wanting more from Meredith and Matthew Farell. All I can say is this book has the passion, tenderness and excitement all books should give someone. It took me into a dream world where everything isn't so perfect but love is triumphant. This book will leave you wondering and smiling. A must read"
5,Very Plesantly Surprised!!,"I am a huge fan of McNaught's and have read her historicals (which I really enjoyed), but am generally hesitant to read many contemporaries. I decided to venture out of my comfort zone a bit & was very plesantly surprised at how much I loved it. I found myself having a very difficult time putting it down once I started it & would highly recommend it!"
2,720 pages and it still manages a rushed ending,"This genre is not usually my pick, but it was for book club so I read it. The fact that it took me two weeks to read it is the first bad sign. If you like the slightly conflicted with misunderstandings romance genre then this is a decent novel. I can do with some misunderstanding and conflict, but after the 20th one and everyone assuming stuff instead of actually talking to each other I doze off quite frequently. It is also too long in my opinion. The book spends 600 pages drawing out the storyline to wrap everything up in the last 100 pages and some things don't even get proper development just to be resolved in 5 pages.Other than that, I liked the style the book was written, but sometimes I was more interested in the business lingo than the actual relationship."
5,I love this book.,I would like to see Judith McNaught do a book on Julia Farrell & Stuart Whitemore so we could have at litte bit more of Mereith & Matt like in Perfect. Thank you
2,Author drifts aimlessly around Indonesia,"This isn't the first book I've read about the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Indonesia, but its promise isn't met by its substance. Yes, the author's exploits are sometimes amusing, sometimes dramatic, but by the end there is so much repetition that I started skipping sections. This book is not comprehensive, but merely conveys the impression that the author's interviews with ""leading"" Islamic figures were haphazardly organized and that he was invariably scared beforehand and relieved afterwards to have survived. It's hard to believe that this author also wrote for first class journals and newspapers. He never managed an interview with Bashar or any (alleged) leading JI figure, his coverage of the Bali attacks was incidental and threadbare, and his background analysis was absent in many cases. The only good thing I can say is that I am glad I borrowed this book from the public library and did not buy it; it's not worth it."
5,PERFECT MUFFINS!!,"This pan bakes all types of muffins perfectly. It cooks even, and muffins DO NOT STICK. I will be ordering another one soon."
1,Incredibly stupid waste of money,"This dvd is incredibly stupid, starring the biggest collection of dimwits outside of an institution. Don't buy - it will make you gag."
4,great for small jobs,"The suction is amazing, it will suck up anything that gets in its path including curtains and throw rugs, for small jobs it cant be beat....I would give it 5 stars but I dont like the on board tool method. It gets in the way, so I removed it."
3,The Best STEREO In The Whole Entire World!,THIS SI THE BEST STEREO IN THE WORLD TRUST ME I OWN ONE. ... I WILL EVEN TAKE IT TO COLLEGE SOMEDAY! THANX AMAZON.COM!
4,"""relaxation music""","quick review- this is good relaxing music to listen to so that you can unwind after a long day at work. It's ambient music with a drumbeat, with some techno mixed in. It has been described as ""lounge music"", which is appropriate, given the tempo of the songs.I had never heard of this musician before, but, intrigued by the album cover and the great reviews, bought the cd. It was just what I was looking for.Did some more research and found that Alex Cortiz has several more cds, so will be buying those as well.* highly recommended music to relax to *"
2,"Boring, without exception","I heard Room 404 once somewhere when I first got active in downtempo DJing and thought it was an awesome, steamy slowsex am grinder that I wanted to have more of. I forgot about Alex Cortiz for a few years, then found the album on Amazon, and ordered it by listening to some of the 30s samples. It all sounded fine so I picked it up.Big mistake. I really don't play this at all - it's just so boring... I suppose my tastes changed or something, but as far as I can figure out, downtempo has moved on (or I moved on from downtempo) and the ""music isn't there"". it's just 4 sets of a predictable loop, followed by another 4, repeat for a duration of 4-5 minutes... You get the picture....And that's a big shame as I really did think highly of Room 404. I still dig it, but the rest of the album makes it, somehow, tainted...Still, 2 stars since I don't hate it, and rather listen to this than most radio channels :-)"
4,A little tight on my foot,"This is a very good looking boot, but the style and fit was not for me. The return was quick and easy. This boot has a pretty pointed toe and the design is not as casual as I was looking for."
5,The best cookie sheet I have owned,"All cookie sheets I buy in the stores for the same price need to be replaced in a few months, but this one was built very sturdy. I was thinking it was going to be a little bit bigger, but its still a good size for small batches of cookies of anything you need to bake. The items I have baked so far with this baking sheets, have just slid off. I didnt even have to use a utensil to get them off. If anything should happen to this product it is covered with a 25 year warrenty and that also helped sell me on this product. This product is also so easy to clean, it takes no effort at all."
5,Love these sheets!,"These are the perfect cookie sheets! Cookies never burn. Easy to handle. Only one thing I would change and that is the size. I'd like bigger ones, but that was my preference, nothing to do with these perfect cookie sheets."
5,An excellent tutorial on Structures and Algorithims,The book has a detailed introduction and explanation to the subject and clearly explains how to analyze and implement in programming. This is done all in C++ and it is suited to students in Computer Science Courses. The exercises at the end of the chapters are quite useful.
5,A thorough well-written explanation of abstract data types,I think I said it all right there. Great for intermediate/advanced c++ users. It also contains sections on various algorithms which implement many of the data structures discussed in previous chapters. Just get the book already!
1,Waste of money,"If you buy this you can expect hours of pure frustration. Just when you get into this game along comes Nemesis and kills you! My favorite of the series is RE2. Yes you have to fight a Nemesis-like guy, but only about 4 times. This guy will come at you every 2 seconds and ruin any type of fun you may have thought you could have."
3,It's a good book,This book is good but there is some ingredents that are being added like ketchup to food that should not be added to but I guess that how the arthor feel about the tast of the food.... And ingredents are missing as well in some recipes. I would have to ask my grandmother for a second opinion about some of them to.I was really surprise of how the book look like when I got it... It looks like a big book with lots of color pictures next to the ingredents from here but it was not.
3,Not The Best!,"This book is ok, if you don't know how to make haitian food already I would recommend this book. But If you would like to perfect your recipe..then get another book. The recipies are a little off and some of them just don't make sense."
4,Let's get cooking,"Love this Book. Reminds me of home cooking growing up. Bought this book to make sure my children weren't too far removed from the Traditional Haitian dishes. Some of the translations are too literal but otherwise, an excellent resource."
1,Disappointed,I am not Haitian. Having said that the recipes did not help. I tried to make one of the recipes and it did not taste like it said. My husband said maybe certain things are implied but recipes are supposed to be instructional. I actually found other recipes that came out phenomenally elsewhere.
4,Thank You Mirta,"This is a wonderful resource for those who are unfamiliar with Haitian cuisine and those of us who did not watch our Haitian mothers in the kitchen. Each dish's name is accompanied by its Creole, French and English name. I found this to be extremely helpful. I love the introductory paragraphs at the beginning of some recipes, explaining the history and/or meaning of the dishes. This definitely puts what you are cooking into perspective and makes the dishes more personal. My only criticism is the lack of photos. A photo of a dish or two would have been an excellent visual, and I say this on behalf of those who are not familiar with Haitian cuisine.Definitely a fixture in the kitchen."
5,"EXCELLENT COOKBOOK! Thanks, Mirta!","As a twice-times visitor to Haiti and now an adoptive mom to Haitian children not yet home, I have very much wanted to obtain authentic Haitian recipes and get to practice. I appreciate the easy-to-follow, straight forward instructions and history/origin provided for many of the recipes. My yummy favorites (and easy to start with)...Diri kole ak pwa rouj -- and -- Bannann peze. This cookbook will provide one simple way for me to help keep Haitian culture alive in my adopted childrens' lives. Thank you, Mirta!"
2,Low budget funny,"I thought this movie was very low budget, however, still funny. It wasn't side cracking funny, but being as though this may be true to life families somewhere in this country (not mine), that just made it more hilairous. I've seen the movie quite a few times and still manage to get some good laughs in."
3,Funny,"I enjoyed this movie. I was glad to see Jaleel White acting again. It's not a block buster, but good for DVD and funny too!"
1,Insulting,"Who wrote this disgusting piece of racist trash?The ending credits show a picture of two white guys with the title Dos Bros Productions. Never spend a dime on anything they have anything to do with.As for Clifton Powell, he has done such excellent work in other roles. What was he thinking when he agreed to be a part of this movie?"
3,Funny and cute,"I saw this movie and thought it was real cute and funny. I'm not surprised to see Jaleel White still accepting roles that still links him to Steve Urkel, but I guess you can take what you can get when you aren't really starring in great roles. I was waiting for him to say ""DID I DO THAAAAT!!!"". Otherwise, it was pretty good. There were some stupid moments, but I would add it to my DVD collection."
2,not happening,"i thought this film was gonna be madd funny. I mean Jaleel White playing the Po-Po Role I thought it would be funny,but this film is just kinda there. Clifton Powell is the mini James brown of the film game,Bro man is in everything. Ella Joyce is still thick like a Sweet Potatoe Pie YES LAWWDD!! Reynaldo Rey(Red) is a Fool he cracks me up,but this film on a whole just seemed thrown together&never gets going."
5,Who Made the Potatoe Salad,This video was just what I ordered and arrived in a timely manner. I saw this movie on a bus trip and was tickled to death. I loved it and knew I had to have a copy.
1,Horrible,"Tom Biscardi has been involved in three major hoaxes regarding bigfoot the most recent being the Georgia hoax. This whole ""documentary"" is one big pat on the back to him. I would not reccomend this to anyone and I hope this gets removed from Amazon soon. He is a joke."
2,Tom BScardi,"I guess it's true about curiosity kills the cat. I had to watch this DVD just out of curiosity because I had heard that even though it's a film with T.B. in it it was pretty well made. The only reason I even gave it 2 stars was because of the witness stories, and even a couple of those seem staged. It really isn't that much different from the stuff on tv. The crew starts getting activity and they leave the area the next day...I don't understand it. The hand of unknown origin has already been proven to be a bear paw so I don't know why they keep shopping this around as an unknown creatures hand. I actually feel kind of guilty for even wasting the 1.99 that I spent to rent it. Only watch if you truly need to know what this is all about, but you really don't get any new information and a couple of fake pictures. Proceed with caution."
1,Ridiculous,"UGH, i am sick of this whole ""national lampoon"" movie thing. The only truly funny laugh out loud, and hillarious National Lampoon movies are the VACATION SERIES, other than that all of them are just bogus and are so stupid they actually put you to sleep. I personally am i HUGE movie buff, and appriciate all sorts of movies, and am open and welcome to new ideas, but this is just ridiculous, how many movies are they going to make? and when are they going to stop? I found this to be more of a horror movie than a comedy. It tries so hard to be funny, but it fails miserably, even my cousin (who laughs at EVERYTHING) had to turn this off within 30 minutes, and it took many days for me to finnish the movie myself, i cant say exactly how long, but i had to watch it in incriments of i think 15 minutes each day, and from the second i started it, i was praying for the 15 minutes to be up! dont watch!!"
1,Could have been so much better,"I orginally saw this on television when it was called Thanksgiving Reunion. I had high hopes for it for a couple of reasons. National Lampoon Christmas Vacation is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies. In addition, there are simply not enough Thanksgiving movies - the whole holiday seems to get skipped over between Halloween and Christmas.The story was not a bad premise. However, it is the kind of movie that I kept watching thinking that I would laugh at any more moment. The story just keeps wandering with not much humor weaved in. The lack of laughter lead to a boring movie. I think I actually, and painfully, finished watching the whole movie. It had a lot of promise and failed to deliver.Add to it that they renamed it to Holiday Reunion (PC move? - since when is Thanksgiving considered offensive..... to whom?).Pass on this movie and pick up Christmas Vacation instead."
1,NO STARS,"This movie was really, really, really bad. I can't believe it was even made. I thought National Lampoon would have written a better movie. Avoid this movie."
5,Are you Techno ?,"Directed by Sarah Champion, this anthology of short stories is dedicated to the ten first years of Techno movement. 19 British writers such as Irvin Welsh, Gavin Hills, Jonathan Brook, Jeff Noon, Alex Garland or Simon Lewis, have been brought together to touch on this movement which deeply touched British society. Sometimes fun, sometimes dramatic, each story is a jewel of modernism."
5,MUST HAVE!,"I was introduced to Stephen Ashbrook's music back in '99 when he was with a band called Satelite in Phoenix. Bought all the CD's I could and have been a fovorite of mine every year since. Awesome voice, beat & lyrics. A MUST have!Fan from Tulsa"
2,Not really exciting,"I really wasn't thrilled with this book. I bought it because I read another one of Babson's books, ""In the Company of Cats,"" and I loved it. This one, however, was very much lackluster in comparison. It just seemed to drag on forever, especially with needless details. Do you really need to know what the coffee tastes like, down to the very last milliliter? Or what color every flower in the garden is? Are these clues supposed to help the reader solve the crime? It just felt like the story was trudging forward with few real plot twists. It wasn't exciting and definitely wasn't a ""couldn't put it down"" sort of book. At only 192 pages, it took me forever to read. Also, one of the reasons I wanted to read this book is because I love cats, and the cat in the book had no real role. The story wouldn't have lost anything without him. He was just awkwardly shoved into the story but had nothing to do with it. All in all, disappointed with this book."
3,"Love Babson, but she's had better novels","It was all right. I read it in a day or so, which is a fairly good indication that it is compelling enough. But not exactly a big surprise at the end...maybe I've just read too many of these!For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
2,Not a whodunit,"This book is a fun read, at least for those of us who find the Anglicisms colorful rather than annoying. For example, apparently in the U.K. one ""sells up"" a house rather than just selling it. Some of the foods are puzzling to this clod, but one of the author's hobbies is apparently cooking so I didn't mind. But a whodunit this is not.In a ""real"" murder mystery the reader is offered clues along the way so if observant and able to winnow the information at least can make a guess as to what has happened. No way in this book as all the critical facts are dumped on the reader virtually at the end. And that's where the killer openly confesses for no particular reason -- other than there's not an iota of evidence for an arrest, much less a conviction. But I did like Tikki, the cat, even if he is totally irrelevant to the plot."
2,Husky Liners,Not what I expected when I ordered custom fit molded floor liner. It reminds me of a paint roller tray. I kick the side walls of the liner when i get in. The bottom can get slippery when wet. Not really worth the money.
1,A waste of my money,"This book was very disappointing, I was looking for a comprehensive book that would explain and give insight into playing the Slots. Instead of getting an informative book I got one that was 99% filler text. You could learn more about slot machines by taking the money you would spend on this book and instead just plunk it into......you guessed it..a slot machine!"
5,Fun and Informative Look at the Machines,"Frank Scoblete's Break the One-Armed Bandits is both a very enjoyable book and a very enlightening book. It has great strategies but it also has some of the best information on how the machines work, how and where the casinos place the loose and tight machines, and how the slot market developed. If you like intelligent, well-written books on gambling put this at the top of your list."
4,Very insightful,I especially found the information on the placement of slot machines useful. Mr. Scoblete's writing style was enjoyable and easy to follow. I only wish he had included more on the subject of money management.
1,Nonsensical B.S.,"This is a total waste of money and time (much like the slot machines). By the way, who is this ""Stoker"" guy who gives all of Scoblete's books raving reviews?"
2,Dated,"The book has some interesting information on casino philosphy for placement of slot machines with different payback rates, something very important to regular slot players, but was written in the 90s when coins were still used. Things may have changed with the conversion to cash/ticket machines."
5,"Book works. Made $1,500.00","I bought this book, went to the casino a week later, and hit a $500. jackpot the first afternoon. The next morning I hit a $1000. jackpot on the slots using the location and other info suggested in this book. Works for me. Recommended."
4,Best Slots Book I've Read--Needs an Update,"I am not crazy about playing slots--but to get free room at the Venetian (LV) I need to put in hours each day, each visit. The Scoblete book is the most informative overall I've read so far on a subject where random chance is the rule. The chapter about which slots are loose was probably good advice--but people don't hear coins falling into the hopper any more--coins have been replaced with paper receipts. Paper payoffs also skew the advice in that excellent chapter on money management. These days most people deposit bills, not coins, into the slot machine and there is no bucket of coins to use or to reserve. Mr. Scoblete needs to revise this book. If he still gambles, I'm sure his well-thought 1994 guidelines would benefit from updating. I would be first on line to buy the new book. The organization and research of ""One-Armed Bandit"" are outstanding."
3,Disappointing strategies--but good history of the machine.,"This book was somewhat disappointing--the strategies are so basic that they really don't add too much information that is useful to serious slot players. However, I did enjoy the sections on the history of the machines and the explanation of the current RNG (random number generator) functions in the slots. This explanation alone is worth the price of the book if you want to know how the new computerized machines actually determine their payoffs."
3,It's OK,"I bought this book 3 years ago after our first trip to vegas. (We won at slots by the way) If you wonder just how these machines work this is a good book. If your looking for a sure fire way to win at slots... don't play them! There is a section where the author talks to a Casino host about where the loose machines are, but the casino's move these machines around."
4,slot help,"even though this book was old, I enjoyed reading it and will try using some of the advise on my next gambling trip."
4,Very Useful,"Have used this for many different things like cookies and biscuits. It's versatile and a great thing to have around. Works great, seems very safe but not hard to clean."
2,Buy the PalmOne Treo 600/650 Stereo Headphone Adapter Instead,Buy the palmOne Treo 600/650 Stereo Headphone Adapter instead. I bought both the adapter and this headset and now I use only the adapter with regular headphones. The problem with this headset is it has almost no bass response. Continuously listening to high-pitched sounds may become annoying after some time. This is definitely an item one should try before buying.
2,Ultimately dissapointing.,"I've had this cake pan for several months and up until about three weeks ago, I had no complaints. It seemed like a great pan. Well, the honeymoon period is over. I was greasing this cake pan with a butter wrapper when I noticed that the wrapper and my fingers came away with a gray residue. I immediately and repeatedly washed it but when I dried it with a towel the residue was still there and it's been there ever since (I've tried washing it at least ten times since with the same results every time). Now I don't know what exactly happened since I don't cut the cakes inside the pan and the outside of the pan has the same problem anyhow but I do know that it worked great until it didn't and there's a possibility that this was an isolated incident. But I certainly won't be buying from them again."
1,Didn't receive what I ordered,"I ordered two of these for a specific baking task to replace my old 8"" pans. When I received them every thing looked OK. Unfortunately when I tried to use them the first time they were 9"" pans that I didn't need. I rechecked the paper work and my order, the billing and shipping docoments all specified 8"" pans. I always keep one of the stickers from the pans so I can review for recommended care. You got it! It specifies 8"". Now I am stuck with two pans I don't need and it not worth sending them back because of the shipping costs."
3,Misleading?,Not quit sure if they are uncoated as stated. They seem to have some sort of coating of some kind on them. I don't care much for the stamp on the bottom of the pan because the impression is in your finished cooked product.
1,Extremely Disappointing,I found this book to be full of holes and too many grammatical errors to make it legitimate in any sort of way. I would recommend that people save their money and invest it something worthwhile. Watching paint dry is more exciting.
2,All the good reviews from Canada?,IT makes me wonder - they all seem to say the same thing and are written by people from London Ontario. They must be students or friends of teh author.The book is poorly written and only midly interesting.
4,Good book by a good teacher of forensic anthropology,"I am biased--Stan Rhine was a professor of mine at UNM. His book reads much like his delivery in class. Stan is an excellent storyteller and a solid forensic anthropologist. His 30+ years as a forensic investiagtor have led him into many adventures. The best of these he relates in this book. I myself have handled the skeletal evidence from some of these cases. While his investigations lack the notariety of say, Clyde Snow's or Bill Maples', the experiences are no less entertaining. I heartily recommend this book for its subtle humor and educational value."
5,Good film,I really like this film. It shows how controversial cochlear implants are within the Deaf community. You see two closely related families who are torn apart over the decision of whether or not to implant their Deaf child.The only downside to this film is that all you see is the family bickering all the time. It gets annoying after a while.
4,"Hard to watch, but very powerful","I had to watch this film for my American Sign Language class. Going in, I thought it would be easy to get through. However, the amount of tension and conflict between the family was hard to watch. People from each side of the argument say thing's that they really shouldn't and they are very offensive. The movie is really great, but it will make you uncomfortable. It also made me realize that despite learning sign, I will never be accepted by the deaf community."
5,"Cochlear Implants, Hearing Parents and Deaf Children",This is an excellent documentary. Some deaf adults believe that it is wrong for a hearing parent to allow their deaf babies to be surgically implanted with a cochlear implant. This movie is about a deaf-hearing family and what happens when cochlear implants enter into the culture and life of a family.
5,Sound & Fury,"I absolutely love this video. I think it shows both perspectives well. As a child of deaf parents, I could identify with the emotions the gal feels of betraying her parents. I definitely recommend this video!"
2,A prejudiced view on Cochlear Implants,"I watched this movie for my ASL course in college, and my classmates and I noticed this video was made by a company that makes cochlear implants. Although this was presented at the very end, I feel it should have been disclosed at the beginning. The sequel for this was no better: I actually stated the grandma needed to be duct-taped and gagged so she would shut up and listen!!"
3,Sound and Fury,"its a good movie to watch to see what kind of drama a cochlear implant impacts on family life ,even if no one in the family is deaf it still impacts the deaf kid in a negative way anyways. good example of what kinds of debates are going on with the deaf community and hearing community"

1,the worst came at wm 13,"how can we describe this show ? as the baddest show of the entire wrestlemania history.Lett me tell you : a poor main event with a two moves jabroni called psycho sid ,shawn michaels absent, bret hart on the end,the rock at the beginnning of his carreer with a lack of work and credibility in his performance 'such as in the other matches' made WM13 one of the worse events of all time.Thanks to the undertaker the show didn't fall into the abyss..."
1,WRESTLEMANIA XIII-THE WORST WRESTLEMANIA OF ALL TIME,"Forget about vieweing WrestleMania XIII. ""Attitude"" may have been born on this night, but this event is truly disappointing. It's amazing how the WrestleMania legacy went down hill for its thirteenth installment. With poor commentating, ridiculous matches, and huge upsets, you'll see why WrestleMania XIII is the worst WrestleMania ever."
3,A 3 match Wrestlmania!,"What an ending to an above average show. Average is good. The crowd didnt really start caring until the Austin-Hart match.Then they were ooing and ahhhing through th street fight, and celebrating with the prince of darkness. This is a rental unless your a huge Austin fan then this a must own."
3,This could've been a much better wrestlemania,"this wrestlemania was kind of an upset since there was no shawn michaels in any of the matches since he was injured and no one really though sycho sid was much of a huge heel. the main event, undertaker vs. sid wasn't that great, but undertaker did show some good moves as he claims the world title. the best matches were the stone cold vs. bret hart ""submission only"" match and the lod/ahmed johnson vs. nation of domination street brawl. the austin/bret hart fight was awesome since this match offically made bret hart into a heel and they show alot of good moves. the lod/ahmed vs. nod street brawl was by far the wildest fight ever when about a hundred different kind of weapons were used in this match. a several couple of matches were awful. the rock vs. the sultan IC title match made rock look like a hapless jobber. overall, this was a good wrestlemania, but an upset with the main event"
2,WRESTLEMANIA WAS SUBPAR AT BEST,"I had the privilage, if you can call it that of being at Wrestlemania 13 and also owning the tape. Plain and simple. One good match, the whold other card stunk. Bret/Austin. All other matches don't even belong on a payperview, let alone a Shotgun."
4,Pretty good,"I really liked the Stone Cold vs. Bret Hart match one of my all time favorites, the rest was pretty dul but the street fight was ok. If you like blood buy this one!"
3,"WrestleMania 13 was alright but not as good as most WM,S","The WWF did a weak wrestlemania for 1997 the only real good match was bret vs austin 7+/10 but i know alot of people think that this match was very brutle and it was but if you want to see a brutle match wait for the Royal Rumble 2000 which comes out on March 21st i think, also there where some other okay matchs like Sid vs Undertaker 7/10 which was in okay WWF ChampionShip Match but not that good for a wrestlemania you would think the WWF would of made a better main event for a Wrestlemania but it was pretty good, If you want in awesome Wrestlemania get WM 10 or WM 12 or even WM 15 or WM 14 they are all very good wrestlemania's but this WM was one of the weaks wrestlmania's yet i give this WM a 6/10 overall."
4,it worked,"It worked fine, I am using it in my Wii. Just make sure to find one on the cheap (less the $10)."
1,Completely Disappointed,"I bought this item to give to my son on Christmas. When I received this item it was not in any sort of packaging, which makes me wonder if I received a use card when in fact I purchased a NEW card!?!?!? I cant believe that!"
5,Does what you think...,"I have no complaints for this memory card. Amazon had it for really cheap and it works with our Wii!!! Other cards didn't work so we went with the one that had ""Wii"" on it."
3,Okay,"It was not my favorite movie, but it did arrive in good time. The movie did not live up to the reviews or summaries."
2,"Meandering, rinky-dink & boring","Very boring. Nobody like Anna Paquin's character can exist in real life; strictly a stereotype. Paquin is very good, this movie's only redeeming feature."
3,Movie was boring.,"Although I very much like the subject matter of this movie, a young strong independent female leading character, the movie is just too long. It drags on about her changing conditions so laboriously that I was finding myself fast forward through parts of it. I remember thinking to myself that most of the things happening to Margaret in the plot I already knew before they happened. The plot was so predictable. Now I really like movies about girls coming of age but this one took itself to seriously. Maybe they were going after a dark character image. I like that to but this movie came across as not dark but more ugly and painful than needed to make it's point. It's a good movie but I would only give it a 6 out of 10"
3,FORMATS :: Read this before you buy,"Be aware that while this set does contain both versions of the film, it includes them IN ONLY ONE FORMAT EACH. The theatrical release is here ONLY in Blu-ray, and the extended version is here ONLY as a DVD. If like me you don't have Blu-ray, you won't be able to watch the theatrical release. And if on the other hand you wanted to watch the highly-regarded extended version in Blu-ray quality, this set won't give you that option."
3,Not a masterpiece for me,I watched the extended cut. I like movies shot in New York with New York actors and they all acquit themselves well. I guess the title comes from the Hopkins poem Matthew Broderick reads to the class. And how did she find out the name of the bus driver and where he lived? Only in the movies. Mark Ruffalo always delivers a fine performance. I also liked the mother/daughter scenes. Not always a bed of roses but the mother tried and both actresses played the scenes quite well. Paquin is always good but this is just an extension of her Frankie Adams in the TV adaptation of MEMBER OF THE WEDDING with Alfre Woodard. Maybe I am too old for teen angst but I do recommend it for those who want to see the extended cut and for the fine performances.
3,GOOD STORY BUT A LITTLE TOO LONG,VERY GOOD CONCEPT BUT IT RUNS A LITTLE TOO LONG. A GOOD WATCH IF YOU HAVE THE TIME. THE ACTING IS VERY GOOD AND THE STORY IS VERY INTERESTING.
3,"Good Intentions, Mediocre Outcome","This movie is something you won't enjoy watching but also won't have the nerve to call it a failure, simply because the movie seems to have come from good intentions.It follows a young high school girl (played by an almost 30-years old actress) who, unwillingly, causes a bus accident during which a woman dies. For over two hours we then follow the girl's spiritual suffering and trying to make it right for the memory of the dead woman while firing her coincidental and teenage angst at her mother.If you liked Gotz Spillman's ""Revanche"" or Von Trier's ""Breaking Waves,"" you probably are not going to like this one."
2,Love it or hate it that I hated.,"I rented this based on the good reviews and the strength of the cast in spite of knowing very little about the film. Thankfully I had a $5 credit so at least I can't say I wasted the money but it's a waste of time. It's listed as released in 2011 but filmed around 2005. Apparently issues with the director not being able to produce a final cut which lead to legal actions and eventually had the studio bring in Martin Scorsese to help with editing. In my opinion the issues showed, the flow was not there making the already LONG movie seem even longer. I never found find myself sympathizing with the main character nor was I drown into her ""inner turmoil"". Maybe that was the point.This is clearly a love it or hate it movie, not much in between. I fall well into the latter. For those who loved, great, you clearly see something in it that I don't."
2,Way to long,I found the first hour of the movie good but then it just seemed to drag on. There was alot of parts in the movie that just did not seem to fit in.
2,chick flick,"I get it: it's a chick flick.The absurdity of the premise -- the girl distracts the bus driver, he goes through a red light and kills a woman, and for the rest of the movie the girl wants to punish the bus driver instead of punishing herself -- that's the mark of the chick flick. The lack of logic, and the presumption that we will sit through two and a half hours without getting bored by this lack of logic.When Matt Damon kisses her, that's the seal of approval: CHICK FLICK.One extra star for the actress who plays the mother, who is wonderful."
4,Me gustó,"Interesante la película, muy buen reparto de actores, buena música, estimo no se arrepentiran de verla para pasar un buen momento"
2,Hollywood spin,"It is just too sad that such a good story ends up with typical Hollywood spin on current affairs.It feels like producers want to make us all guilty for whatever happening in the world.The world of teenager, selfish but at least she finds peace at the end. I knew how it ends 40 min. before .What a waste of good acting."
1,BUMMER!,I got this movies because it got good reviews from the majority of people and I saw the trailer. It looked like it would be a very good movie. It started out really good but then went nowhere. Too much time was spent fighting and arguing in the movie. It started to bore me.
1,Once again hoodwinked by Amazon,"I bought this BLU RAY movie because of the glowing and universally positive reviews of the EXTENDED CUT. Of course, the EXTENDED CUT is not on BLU RAY is it? No, it is surprisingly on an additional STANDARD DVD while the theatrical version is on the superior BLU RAY. Thanks Amazon, thanks a lot."
1,HORRIBLE PLOT,"DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS... A woman inadvertently distracts a bus driver into running a red light and kills a woman, and somehow believes that this was just his fault, and wants him to get fired from his job. She originally lied about what happened, and later tries to change her story with the police. The police do nothing, and I don't blame them. It was still an accident that she in part caused. She gets a lawyer with the help of the dead lady's friend. They somehow manage to get money from the bus companies insurance to a person that was related to the deceased but had nothing to do with her until money was mentioned. The bus company will not fire the bus driver which was her main intention. She gets angry and then the show ends. 90% of the characters in the movie have NOTHING to do with the plot, and is confusing to what part they even played in the movie. This movie is at the top of my list for all time worst movies I've ever seen, PERIOD."
1,Depressing and annoying,Depressing and annoying. This movie is too much like real life. It reminds me of the worst times of my life. Watch something uplifting rather than this...
1,Train Wreck,"I saw this in a theater, so it's possible that the directors cut is worth a look, but I doubt it. I'm amazed by the positive reviews the film has received. This is easily one of the ten worst films I've ever seen. It had no flow, bogged down by scenes that go nowhere, behaviors that are never explained and the editing was so bad that in one scene, I thought the projector broke. Run, don't walk, away from this film."
1,Bloody Awful,I only rented this movie because it got a somewhat positive score on MetaCritic at 61.It is the last time I'll watch something that gets less than a 70.The lead actress was terrible....she's 30 years old playing a 16 year old - how stupid does Hollyweird think the public is?The answer is very if you watch the movie!
1,Do Not See This Movie!,"*Spoilers* I don't understand how there are positive reviews about this movie! It was the biggest waste of time I have ever spent! I started watching this last night and got so bored I stopped it and had to finish it today. Yes, the acting was good, but the story was lacking and then there was the pointless landscape views. I didn't watch this movie to take a tour of New York City landscape, yet that is what I felt like I was doing. Some people might be moved by the story... but I was not! And the fact that in the end nothing was even accomplished, the guy didn't even get fired, made it so much worse because there wasn't a ""end product"" that I could enjoy. Instead it just ends with Lisa and her mom crying. Such a lame movie! Seriously, don't waste your time!"
4,good movie,"it was a really good movie. The acting was great. I really felt sorry for Margaret, she was really confused and ridden with guilt."
3,Anna P. good performance...,"The previous of this movie got a hold of me, the movie itself took a little longer to get the story all set up."
3,OK NOT GREAT,"Wonderful performances by Anna Paquin and the supporting cast. Plot begins in an interesting way, but loses its way about half way through. Too many scenes that do not ring true. Great photography of NYC but lingers a little too long in places. Can't reveal why I found it unrealistic without spoiling it for others. Still worth seeing for the acting and photography."
3,To sum it up,"This is basically a movie about a young girl going through a traumatic situation and not getting the proper attention/help to deal with it. So naturally, she turns to everything else and responds dramatically. I guess I give it 3 stars because of how real it can be for many. This is what can happen if you don't get help and it can make life very difficult, as seen in the movie."
4,Margaret,"Tough subject! Outstanding performances all around. Climbing inside the ever-changing mind of a brilliant, hormonal teenager has got to be one hard insight. Hormones running everywhere and no one to notice. I was impressed with how honest the characters seemed. Glad I saw it!"
4,Nice Pendant,"The pendant is very nice, just what I expected. The chain is nice also, but much to long. I put the pendant on a different chain. It arrived on time and I would purchase from this vendor again."
5,Nice manly pendant!,"I have purchased mutiple pendants over the years most of which have been a disappointment. It's so hard to tell their actual size and solidity, and my 15 year old son is picky. Well, this piece didn't disappoint! It is a good size and is solid enough to clearly be ""manly"". It seems more sturdy in real life than in the pic! I bought it for my 15 year old son, but my husband loves it as well! I'm probably going to buy another for him! The chain is sturdy too...looks like it will survive a teen boys antics! Great pendant at a great price!"
2,Pretty....but bad quality,"I loved it when it first arrived, but the little ring on the top of the star broke a month into wearing it. I was pretty careful with it. I wore it all the time but would take it off for bed and a shower yet it still broke. It is pretty though."
5,"Beautiful, and he loved it",Very happy with this. But open box and repackage before giving as a gift; it's packaged oddly inside the box.
4,Good Value,This product is a good value and easy to use. Be prepared to use lots of paper when printing out your patterns. The first one I did came out to 25 pages! I used both sides of the paper so that helped. I plan on months of time put into the piece as every square will be used. So beginners beware!
5,A brilliant book on Dostoevsky,"I highly recommend this brilliant book on Dostoevsky, which examines his work from a religious perspective. The writing is superb, the insights fascinating and momentous, and the interplay between biography and literature judicious. The life may not illuminate the works, but the works certainly illuminate the life: Girard reads Dostoevsky's career as a struggle to conquer pride, a struggle that ended in the serene victory that is The Brothers Karamazov. Easily the best essay on Dostoevsky I have ever read."
3,Works somewhat,"I'm extremely allergic, and was excited about this product. I followed the directions on the lable, and applied it 15 min bf I went outside. I put it on with the intent of getting rid of the poison ivy in my yard. Once I started working I noticed that where I applied the lotion on my arms, it started to get warm and burn a little, after about 30 min. of working, the sensation was worrisome. I washed it off and the next day had a light poison ivy rash. It wasn't nearly as bad as it has been in the past, so it does work some, but not completely when in direct contact, and for me, not without some side effect."
5,Ivy Block works,"Ivy Block works very well, but does not make you absolutely bullet-proof against poison ivy. Plan to use Zanfel and Technu to wash off with after working in poison ivy."
5,it works,"I am very sensitive to poison ivy, and it is really abundant in our area. It pops up at the edge of my garden every year, and now with Ivy Block I can get it out and didn't have any reaction afterward. Just make sure to cover every inch of exposed skin."
5,poison Ivy Block,This stuff really works. I've used it for years on mountain bike trails. I forgot to put it on once. Once.It's a runny cream. You smear it on like sun block. Shower it off when you're done.
4,Pro-active VS. Re-active Solution,"This is an excellent product. It is hard to find and not cheap, however is really it does provide pro-active protection."
3,"Ok, but Cusinart MUCH Better","I ordered one of these when Amazon was out of the Cusinart pan that I came looking for. This pan does the job, but it is flimsy (it actually warps when hot) and things stick to it (no non-stick).I also have the Cusinart 14"" ""Chef's Classic"", which is a much better pan. It is non-stick, has bigger holes, and rolled (rather than crimped) edges. It never warps in a hot oven. The only drawback is that the non-stick can scratch.Unless you plan to do your cutting on the pizza pan, I'd recommend the Cusinart instead."
5,Love this...,"I bought a second one of these because I liked it so much! I love to make my own pizza and these pans make for a great crust. In a closed bottom pan, you sometimes get floppy crust near the middle which doesn't happen with these. They also wash up beautifully in the dishwasher, and dont rust like my old pans did."
2,Too big for toaster oven,"The pizza crisper stated that it would fit the toaster ovens, but even though I have a newer toaster over that holds a 12"" pizza, the crisper is too large for the oven.I will eventually use it in my regular oven, but I haven't had a chance to use it yet."
3,"Good, but a Disappointment!",Those who expect the same quality or better than in This or That will be disappointed. Although there are a handful of standout tracks on here...this record could've been a lot better. It's missing the raw energy and dope lyricism from the first album. The songs on here seem more polished and aimed at a mainstream audience with too many R&B hooks and not enough fire. The dvd included is a real bonus and makes up for the album's shortcomings.
3,Sounds a little too commercial,"This or That was a better album than this. There are some dope rhymes galore but my problem are the choruses to the songs. They're either R&B-flavored or just weak overall and what a listener remembers most in a song is the chorus. I suspected that this album would be different since Sway started working for MTV. Also, there's too much Chino XL on here. I like Chino as much as the next fan but I could have just popped in one of his albums if I wanted to hear him that much."
5,Nice pan,"I use my toaster oven all the time and this little pan helps with warming up a few servings of just about anything. Broiler pan comes in handy too for frozen wings or most little things you do not want to start the big broiler for. Very handy, easy to clean."
2,A lesson in wasted money,"This item warps at moderate temperatures, like 350. The rack wobbles since because the pan is bending at opposite angles and food has even slide off while in the oven. EVERYTHING sticks to it, and I've had to take a steel wool to it. It's flimsier than Nordicware, which I bought it to replace, but I'm going back to it. The teflon flakes easiy on Nordicware, but I've lined it with foil to extend it's life."
3,not the size I thought it was,I thought this was bigger than it was(my bad). for that price I got a much bigger one for my oven.
1,I voted with my feet,"I bought and read this book many years ago. I got about half way through this book, when I felt a dark feeling. I didn't like that feeling and quit reading it. I threw it in a dumpster. I didn't want anyone else to read it. I have read many other works of Mormon history and not had that feeling. I do not recommend the book."
5,"Brilliant, thorough, and evenhanded","This is the best kind of history: thorough, well-informed, objective, insightful. Its evenhanded, meticulous research and compelling storytelling will give you an appreciation of the huge role Emma played in Joseph's successes and her strength in dealing with his weaknesses. Mormons owe Emma far more than most realize. If you are interested in the early LDS Church, either as a matter of faith or as a matter of curiosity, this is an essential piece of the picture. Informative and inspiring."
4,The Life Of An Underappreciated Woman,"This book does a fine job presenting the life and times of Emma Hale Smith. She believed her husband, Joseph Smith, was a prophet because he was too ignorant to have come up with the Book Of Mormon on his own. She stayed with him through thick and thin, until his mob-murder in Liberty, Illinois. Their greatest conflict was in her objection of polygamy, which Joseph had considered ""The Sacred Principle"". Brigham Young, who would later have 41 wives, grew to dislike Emma because of her anti-polygamous position; surprise, surprise. This is a good and valuable book, both for its illustration of day-to-day life back then, and for the picture of Mormon history presented."
2,cheap and dull,Get a slicer that is of higher quality. I consider this one a loss and do not use it. It is dull and flimsy.
4,judo chop,I got the slicer for my mother due to her aching hands. And she loves it. Would i recommend? Yes!
1,Cut the tip of my finger off!,"The ""finger guard"" doesn't work very well. Doesn't dig into the item and I ended up cutting the tip of my finger off. :( This item's going to be headed to File 13!"
2,Not the best,I bought this to replace one I gave my sister. I really don't remember the brand of the other. This one is not nearly as user friendly. Just doesn't do that good of a job slicing veggies. Wish I could ask for my old one back!!
3,Another teary ending,"I bought this mostly for one thing: onions. I'm a notorious weeper when it comes to cutting onions, and I'd hoped the mandolin would let me whip through them faster. Alas, it was not to be. Using the mandolin only makes things worse! The onion smell is stronger, and the mandolin only works about halfway through the onion before the onion layers pull apart and I have to chop the rest by hand.Having to fight with it when it doesn't cut all the way through or slides around the cutting board doesn't improve my mood. It's rather flimsy, and the blade is too dull to work easily. Brute force is about the only thing this mandolin respects."
3,Its a good value for the $,"This product works well enough but its hard to tell which attachment is which. For instance, it is virtually impossible to tell the difference between the thin slicing attachment and the thicker slicing attachment. The other attachments are easier to discern by their blades."
5,Great Book!!,"This is a great story as told from the heart of a true American hero. Mr. Miller's story is told in a way that is interesting to adults and yet tame enough for young readers. His accounts of training are written with humor and his narrative of the fighting on the way to the Rhine River are vivid and exciting. The highlight of the book is his and his tank platoons crossing of the severly damaged Ludendorf Bridge in pitch darkness to support American infantry on the other side. His tanks were the first to cross and it was not known if the bridge could sustain the weight. Also there were numerous wholes ripped in the floor of the bridge. Guided only by engineers tape that could hardly be seen, Mr. Miller's tanks fulfilled their mission and for his leadership in crossing, and for actions on the other side of the bridge, he earned the Distinguished Service Cross. This is a first rate story and a book fit for young and old alike."
1,Charles Schultz turns another blind eye,"While this book certainly uses an interestingly stark, post-modernist style to capture the subtle ennui of the miserable proletariat world of one Charles Brown, Charles Schultz once again focuses on the 'comic' aspects of cartooning, rather than the myriad problems which affect me personally. Once again he ignores the fact that people like me are forced to eat leftovers, have been reduced to welfare collection (though we do maintain excellent computer systems). . .and don't get me started on his lack of gay characters. I've purchased some of his other books, and if I don't see any improvement, I'll be forced to draw the conclusion that he is pro-bald and pro-yellow shirt and anti-everything else."
5,"Avery 5"" Binder Review","Great product! Well-made & perfect for my situation. I am keeping a ""owner's manual"" of a '95 Firebird that I am building, and I have enough info on file now that I needed this large 5"" ringed binder to hold it all."
1,"Avery 5"" Binder #79606 (and other colors) - HORRIBLE","I am responsible for a budget of around $300,000 per year in office products, so I have lots of experience with binders of all types. Avery's 5"" binders (which I've purchased a few) - and other sizes they carry, in my opinion, are the worst binder construction of all manufacturers that I've experienced. This is mostly the case with their larger capacity binders. I have had to replace too many as, after short time, the clasps don't close or line up properly and sheet protectors get caught - it's a mess and very aggravating (which is what prompted me to write this scathing review after being aggravated by yet another defective Avery large capacity binder). Until they show that they care about the quality of the products they manufacture and sell for a hefty profit - and build a better quality binder, I will not purchase another Avery product - again, based on my own experiences with this product (had to add this so I'm not accused of libel)."
4,Pretty solid and secure,"I bought this for my expanding collection of song lyrics since I outgrew the 3-inch binder I had been using. This works well for the 300+ pages of songs which I have encased in plastic page protectors (or whatever they're called!). The only drawback is that it is so heavy and cumbersome that it doesn't fit on a standard music stand now, so I will be adding an extension for the stand."
5,Must-read for anyone who works in groups,"I really enjoyed this book. It was very readable and well written. I appreciated how the viewpoints and examples used were neutral and usable regardless of the reader's perspective on any issue.Some of the more interesting points were: (1) an explanation of the pressure to conform, and why this pressure is surprisingly high even among those who consider themselves independent thinkers (2) the power of being first to speak in a group and the efficacy of a firm and confident tone (3) the two types of dissenters: contrarians and disclosers; and the importance of disclosing one's opinion and reasoning (4) discussion of ""groupthink"" and how group opinions form based on the group's members.I appreciated Sunstein's frequent reference to psychological studies. That made this book much more credible and useful than one where an author merely formulates theories and writes about them."
4,Important Work,"This book gathers together and puts a philosophical/political thoery frame on a range of findings in social science about conformity, information gathering, groupthink, fanaticism, and dissent. The lesson is that a free society needs to encourage, and maybe reward, dissent. If you're familiar with other books the author has published recently (Republic.com, Designing Democracy), the philosophical story and institutional proposals will be familiar. But the survey of the social scientific findings is worth the price of the book."
5,Really Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really liked this book. It was really sad. But it was really weird. I mean, you knew they were going to kill Strom. They wouldn't just let him give the sickness to the other valuable racehorses. Even though, it was really sad."
3,This book was almost awful except at the end.,"I thought this book was great at the end. Many of you probably know me as Claire from Virginia. I find it unrealistic that Storm is suddenly cindy's favorite horse. The in #20 she is so overcome with grief she almost dies of a broken heart. Then in #21 they mention him once and Cindy is magicly over him. They don't even mention him after that book. How can the stupid, dumb, blonde love someone so much and then magically forget about them. What's happened to the other horses like Precocoius and Fleeting Moment? Why arent' Wonder, Princess, and Shining having any more foals? i have to say Karen Bentley is the worst writer I've ever read. please feel free to email me with comments, good and bad. I have all TB books and love the TB series as if it were my own. Sorry Mrs.Campbell."
1,I wouldn't even give one star!,"what has happend to the TB series?I'm a loyal fan, I have faithfully read all the books. They are not what they used to be!If I was in charge of a prized Thoroughbred like Glory, I wouldn't be ignoring him just because a horse I haven't known for NOT even a full year! I would be excited about traning a horse like Storm, but this Book dosen't hardly mention Glory!I also wouldn't be crying my life away by a mound of dirt like Cindy does in later books.Why Cindy would ignore Glory after all they went through is beyond me!!I'm VERY glad Jonna is coming back and I'm very happy with her new book!KEEP IT UP JONNA!!!!!!"
5,Very Good! And Very Sad!!,"I think this is a great one! I can't belive its so sad. Poor Storm. For that person who wrote about Champions Spirit, and said she should forget about Storm and continue on, I say you're to insenstive. If that happened to you, would you go ""Oh well, who cares? He was just a Horse""? This is a great book, and for those of you who haven't read it, you definately should!"
4,Tear-jerker,"I only have 11 in the thoroughbred series, because they are near impossible to find in the A.C.T in Australia. This book was relaly sad. The main thing that I didn't like about it was that Storm was too good to be true. The book went on and on about how perfect he is, and to me that gave away the ending because him being 'perfect' would make it so much more sad if he died. But i was definately crying! Anyway feel free to email me about this or just to chat!!!!! I'd love it if you did!"
4,It was allright.......it could've been better......,"I pretty much enjoyed this book, but after reading it , I realized that as much as i like cindy, she is sort of a brat. I mean after one of the races where he got third she's like, "" how could by beloved perfect storm try SSSOOO hard and not win???"" I mean, you can't always win, and i don't think i've ever met a horse as affectionate as storm. I really did like this book, though, because it also made me learn a little bit more a bout EIA, even though i already know some about it. I was in my room , and when i got to the part where they told cindy he tested positive for EIA, tears just started running down my face!!! Then when I was finished, I went outside and spent some time with my horse. I can't imagine that ever happening to him!!!"
2,A review for 'Cindy's Heartbreak' by Horse [person],"I rate this item with 3 stars because, I mean I know that Storm is very important to Cindy and all, but, I mean first they introduce Storm at the end of the last book and then talked about him most of the way through 'Cindy's Heartbreak'. I guess that it seems like you don't have that special conection with Storm like you did with Wonder or Pride. It is probibly because you saw Wonder and Pride from the day they were born and you wached them grow-up, and Storm just kind of apeared in the books and then died. As you can see I guess it takes me a while to get used to new horses."
5,SSOOOOOOOOOOO SSSSAAAAAADDDD,"This book is SSSSOOOOOO sad. I loved Storm :( . I am glad that no other horses got it but WHY STORM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Every time I read this book it brings tears to my eyes. Like the sentance. "" He gave his last, long whinny"". THAT IS THE SADDEST PART!!!! I really miss Storm and I wish his only book would be a good one. I hope that there is a horse I like as much as him in the future books."
2,Not as pictured....,"I receieved these African violets the other day.Hirt's Gardens shipped them with careful packaging (masking tape to hold in the soil, each plant carefully wrapped in newspaper, then styrofoam peanuts to fill the box) - there was very little spillage and no damage to the plants. The plants came healthy & well.However... the violets hardly look like the photos. The ""bell"" shape is hardly discernable from a violet you'd buy at the supermarket. The light pink one has a very washed out color and the ""pale blue"" one isn't. The one advertised as pale blue is vibrant purple. It is a lovely shade of purple, however, purple violets being as common as they are - are not nearly as impressive as the pale blue color pictured. To be honest, the violets don't look very extraordinary at all.Healthy lovely plants... just not as unique as I had hoped."
2,Not as Pictured II,"Violet was not as pictured- not pink or blue at all, nor were they bell shaped. Just plain and deep purple."
1,Most biased book ever,"I have never read a more biased book than this. I go to a Christian school, and we were all forced to purchase this book and read it as class material. However, I cannot stand it. This book is clearly written by a close-minded Christian bashing other world views.If you have to read it for school, good luck to you. If you want to buy this book and read it for fun, DON'T. Worst-spent 25 dollars of my life."
1,Religious bias,"I haven't finished this book, which was recommended to me by a religious person who felt it would ""cure"" my atheism.After a few chapters, it became obvious it was written by an individual who earns a living through religion. And it was published by a religious press.It is so biased, it is worthless as a legitimate research document. It probably serves those deeply religious. To me it's just more nonsense to promote the religious myth which has been the biggest impediment to advancement of humanity since the bibles.Norm"
2,Understanding The Times,"I ordered this book for a college class. What I found was that the book comes in numerous editions both unabridged and abridged. The main difference between this version and the current unbridged version is number of pages and that the author has separated out the New Age movement into an Appendix in later editions. Overall I think the book is good for a basic classroom setting. It does go into the basics of beliefs on Humanism, Marxism, the New Age Movement, and Christianity. This would be a good read for someone who just wants to learn about how each group views the world. Keep in mind though that the author writes the book from a Christian worldview."
4,This Book came to my life at the right time,"This book had inspired me to go back to school and take charge of my life. Rene tells it like it is ""no excuses"""
4,Great DVD for children,Brought these for my grandchildren for Christmas and three others and They loved it. I recommend them for anyone. Even I liked them
2,You'd better LOVE Tom & Jerry!,"Because 2/3 of the 'toons are T&J. Only one Bugs, one Pepe, two T&S's, plus the unusual and delightful The Dot and the Line. Very glad I got this from the library; I would never consider buying it."
5,Loved the Classics !!,Loved it but was a little disapointed that there were not more Fog Horn Leg Horn cartoons .... This was what I was after.. Not to take away from the collection I still would have purchased it and also recommend it to all fans of the Old School Cartoons !
5,childhood memory jogger,Picture quality was better than expected. The collection of course is timeless and pleasantly nostalgic.The music in the tom and jerry episodes are classics by now. The bugs bunny piece was the only misfit in this collection.
3,Academy Awards Animation Collection rating,I was hoping to see Foghorn Leghorn but it wasn't on there just on the DVD cover. I thought there would be more laughs.
5,WB's best,I have a lot of these on other collections. But a few are only on this set. Well worth the time.
2,DONT BUY THIS CRAP DVD!,MOST OF THIS DVD IS TOM & JERRY and really old crap that you never heard of. great if you like tom & jerry
4,Big Fish in a Small Pond,"Although it's a little dated, this is almost certainly the best book available on portfolio evaluations."
4,Great look at early IR theory,E. H. Carr provides an overview of international relations theory at a time when it was not a defined discipline. The real value of this book is seeing just how far sighted E. H. Carr was. The book itself is a basic overview of the tenants of international relations theory using the twenty years between the two wars as a case study. It looks primarily at the realist model but also brings in ethics and international law into his discussion. For those who are looking for an entertaining and fun read of IR Theory this is a great place to go. It has several updated introductions for the more serious scholar but Carr's work itself is a great study for those interested in IR and has a real love of it.
2,only another scholar can love,This book can only be appreciated by other historians. The writing style is plodding at best. Reading this book requires too much time and concentration. I do not believe the great effort needed to get through this book resulted in my gaining much historical information. Maybe the author should have included more examples from real history to make his points. I admit I am not exactly sure what his important points were and do not believe going back to find them is worthwhile.
5,Just what I wanted,The small jelly roll pan is the perfect size for roasting vegatables for dinner or baking a smaller batch of cookies. The smaller size allows me to fit several pans in my oven (for baking different items at once) and makes it quick and easy to manage and clean up. The sturdy weight of the pan keeps it from warping. I love it and my friends want one too.
2,Losing coating,I have used this pan 4 times and the silver coating is already coming off and I'm assuming I'm eating it. Disappointed!
4,Great Pan,Heavy duty pan. No warping in oven. Only thing that would make it better is if it were non stick
1,don't buy this pan,"I just wanted a small pan for toasting bread. This pan is the right size, and it is substantially made, but it would not stop oxidizing. Every time we handled it, even after multiple uses and washings, it would leave a gray residue on your hand. After about 4 months, I threw it in the trash."
4,Nice television,I find the picture to be bright and clear. Easy set-up and connections. Good price for a 27 inch t.v. This t.v. takes up less room than my old 25-inch. I would recommend buying one!
5,Essentials for the down-sized kitchen,"The critical questions for the down-sizer/right-sizer is this: how is a new kitchen possession better than something I already own? Can the new possession replace several other possessions?The name says it all. The Bake 'n' Roast Pan is perfect for baking a cake (or casserole) or for roasting a good-sized piece of meat. Furthermore, it is lightweight, deep, and unbreakable. The 9x13 glass pan I had been using is none of these, nor is it deep enough for roasting. I had already down-sized my turkey roaster out my life, so buying this pan did not enable me to decrease the number of my kitchen pans. However, if you are really determined, you can flip the pan over and use the underside as a cookie sheet. That's three pans for the price of one."
5,Interesting Documentary,"It basically covers the famous event that occured in Phoenix, Arizona in 1997, which is the appearance of strange lights in the sky. Most people who saw it interepreted it as a huge UFO with lights coming from underneath it. Others said they were flares. The mayor of Arizona mocked and rediculed this event.I wasn't in Pheonix to know if it was a UFO or not, but I saw this documentary and all the videos displayed in it. I am more on the UFO side of the argument because as they say, this universe is too big for us to be alone in it.The fact that the same mayor who mocked this event later confirmed that what appeared in 1997 was a UFO and not from this earth, is quite Interesting!Good documentary."
5,Phoenix Lights revealed,"Winner of numerous awards at film festivals around the country, this film manages to get Dr. Edgar Mitchell and Gov. Fife Symington on film and on the record about this amazing phenomenon witnessed by thousands. Interviews with witnesses such as military pilots who witnessed the craft itself and many highly credible professional people, this event went on for hours across the state of Arizona. This DVD may just change your mind! Excellent production values and great footage of the lights themselves. This is one to own."
4,"Good documentary, although lacking a few things","This is a well put together piece documenting the thousands of reports of unexplained lights over the Phoenix area in 1997. Contains many eyewitness reports, video footage and commentary from experts in the field.However, I would have liked to have seen some analysis of the flare theory dropping behind the mountains. On another program attempting to debunk the incident, they plausibly showed how the line of disappearing lights coincide with the outline of the mountain. True, no illuminated smoke or parachute is visible, but at that distance, would it show?What is more conclusive are the reports and video footage of the triangular series of amber lights (and in the years afterwards) in my opinion.The DVD extras are not very interesting, wanted some follow-up investigatory work.All in all, a very interesting documentation of the lights, albeit, not very objective, but fascinating."
1,Disappointing,"I was expecting something different from this DVD. Practically the entire movie is just interviews with just a little bit of footage actually added in. The special effects are horrible, and don't really add anything to the simulated videos that are shown. There's very little actual footage here. To make matters worse, the interviews seem so biased. Every single person has the same opinions, basically stating they think this event was alien related. There's no skeptical point of view at all. It just would have been nice to see a little variety. After watching a few interviews, you start to predict what the next person will say cause they are all the same. Don't purchase if you're expecting videos and analysis of the footage."
2,Quantum Leap of Faith,"I was hoping for something a little more scientifically based. Actually any objective science interjected here would have been the only objective science.At one point someone is listing all the things it could not be - I speak in wonderment to the tv: 'what about balloons?' - no one mentions the most obvious - balloons of some type. Frustrating. It only arrives at night, moves steadily in a relatively straight line; I hear no one mention which direction or at what speed the wind was blowing during this event.I think I heard that a few days ago someone in the Phoenix area put together something involving fishing-line, flares and balloons and wasn't too far off the mark as far as presentation.And why, just because it is unidentified does it have to be extra-terrestrial in origin? Not just extra-terrestrial, but directed by aliens that feel nothing but well-being toward us."
2,Mallory is not this stupid,"The Baby-sitters club series is really great- I've got about sixty of the books. However, this one is not good, to put it mildly. I mean, here Mallory is with her favorite author in the world, and she gets mad at her. Why? Because-and if you are reading this and you have never read this book, I promise that this is true- she found out that the author had a really horrible childhood, and all of her books are really cheerful. So Mallory gets mad because she says that an author is SUPPOSED to write about her own experiences, not something different. HeLLLOOOO? Does Mallory think that Jules Verne REALLY went 20,000 leagues under the sea, or that Agatha Christie REALLY murdered someone, or that Mary Shelly REALLY brought back someone from the dead? I kind of doubt that someone in real life would actually act like this."
1,I thought Mal knew better.,"Wanting to be a writer myself, (and since I LOVE The BSC!) I bought this book expecting it to be good. WRONG! It was highly boring! Not only that, but it was VERY unreal. I would NOT get mad at an author, just because she doesn't write about her life, I mean COME ON! This BSC book was a dud. --Age 15"
2,Not one of the better ones,"I was surprised at this book and how it went. Mallory gets the chance to meet and work with a favorite author of hers, but then realizes that the author doesn't use her own real-life experiences for her books....So? Mallory wants to become an author, any author knows you need imagination because many of them write completely differently than what they experienced. Stephen King certainly didn't have ghosts and monsters after him yet he does a great job with horror, so I found this story and Mallory's reactions to be unrealistic. Not one of the better books, to be sure."
4,"Mallory Pike, No.1 Fan.","Mallory Pike, No. 1 Fan was the 80th installment in the babysiters club books and it was easily as good as the other 79. Mallory Pike has to research her chosen career in an imaginative way for a school essay. She has no problem finding her career, but ideas for learning something in an imaginative way don't come easy. After reading a playscript she decides to write a play to help her along with the achievment of doing something and seeing it acted out by the Kids can do anything club ( Kids club. ) But her teacher refuses that proposal and she decides to add to it - compare her expierience with the great write, Henrietta Hayes. But then Mallory finds things out about Mrs. hayes which make her question Henrietta about being a great writer? But will things turn out right for poor Mallory? To find out, read the book."
3,Easy read,A good read overall. Some parts are quite engaging and funny. An easy read which will make you smile once in a while and one can easily relate to a lot of stuff in here.
3,...for an idle moment,The book consists of a number of independent humorous essays on inconsequential everyday topics. the reader will be struck by the difference of circumstances and attitudes between the late nineteenth century and the present day.
4,funny,very funny and one of the funniest writers ever however this does not measure up to 3 men in a boat or three men on the bummel which are classics
4,Mostly Clever,"I have been on a Jerome Jerome kick lately, reading everything. This is one of the better ones. Mostly clever and humorous and still relavent 100+ yrs. later."
5,Hilarious,"A wonderful, old fashioned witty book. Well written, well thought out and original. Some pieces deserve reading several times to fully appreciate how clever the writer has been."
5,This is a 'quarter sheet pan',"This is half the size of a true jelly roll pan or sheet pan. It's great for a few biscuits or anything for a small family that needs to go in the oven.I always buy the highest quality cookware and bakeware and this pan is of the BEST QUALITY of any pan I've ever purchased.Chicago Metallic makes excellent products and this is really amazing; it's very heavy with rolled edges, not inclined to warp under higher temps.If you need a smallish pan for baking this is the one to order."
4,Great for small baking jobs,"I was tired of using a big cookie sheet for every single job and wanted a smaller version. I love the results I get when baking with this heavy-duty pan and it is easier to wash because of the small size (fits in the sink). I don't like to put it in the dishwasher because water (then rust) builds up under the edges, though I don't wash any pans with this type of edge in the dishwasher. My only complaint is that my husband used it once for baking some chicken and I have not been able to get the stains off. However, it doesn't seem to affect cooking so this is a minor issue. Other than that it has served us well."
3,NOT a Jelly Roll Pan,"Normally, anything made by Chicago Metallics is a quality product. This is just to alert potential buyers that this is NOT a true jelly roll pan. The dimensions of a jelly roll pan should be 10 x 15-inches. This is more like the dimensions of a ""quarter-sheet pan."" If you're using a recipe that calls for a jelly roll pan, this small pan will throw it off--in fact, the dough or batter would probably be too much for the pan."
5,"I Love Hanson, any of their music is AWESOME!",Hanson Rules! I Love Hanson. I have over 1000 pictures and every book they ever came out with! I also have ONLY 5 imports but I NEED them all. If anybody has imports that they do not want please contact me at dtowne@enetis.com. Thank-You and have a Very Merry Christmas!! 12-19-98
4,Quissett,"I was surprised by the twists and turns in this story. When I thought I figured out the main characters they changed and usually I think I can project an outcome when I'm reading a story but not in this one. I'm not sure about the role of the Police Chief and the Italian mobster, the fate of the mooring in Quissett Harbor, but perhaps they and Jesse Souza will reappear in ""Return to Quisset"". Only Gordon knows. I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. I am now reading ""The Hyannis House"" by Gordon Mathieson; I hope you'll read my review when I'm finish."
3,"A nice mystery, a lovely setting and a plot with many twists and turns.","I've never been to Cape Cod or Martha's Vineyard, but after reading Gordon Mathieson's book, Quissett, I have a strong sense of those lovely islands. Quisset is about the mysterious and unexpected drowning of a beloved Quisset-dweller, Sam Parker. While the hurriedly-closed investigation rapidly proclaims it a suicide, clues begin to attract the attention of a young couple, once the students of Parker's wife. Paranormal forces compel the couple toward the clues which only heighten their curiosity.Rich in character development and plot, this book takes the reader back in time to discover the origins of the various relationships and local traditions that make this book such an enjoyable read. The mystery slowly unravels, always leaving room for speculation as to the outcome. I was satisfyingly caught by surprise at the finish. A nice mystery, a lovely setting and a plot with many twists and turns. What more could a reader ask?"
1,Another Shoddy Philips Product,"I had another Philips DVD which skipped. I trusted it was a fluke. NOT! This Philips DVD player skips. The Home theatre would be nice if all the speakers worked. The tweeters only PRETEND to work. The instructions were written by Japanese School Children. I plowed through and managed to hook up the lousy DVD player in about eight hours. Unbelievable that I thought I could buy a Home system for under ... which would work. How could I be so dumb. On a good note, the unit was delivered safely wrapped in ten pounds of bubble wrap, and quickly. Guess they couldn't get rid of them fast enough."
5,Life Changing,"This is an amazing auto set! Michael Clouse brings to light the fact that we can't just change our actions, we must change our mind set and thinking. I love the bonus CD to listen to every morning and every night for 30 days...life changing!!C. Riddle"
4,"Vintage W.E.B, Griffin","If you're a Griffin fan, you've probably already read this book and series. The continuing saga of Lowell and company. It's still my favorite of all his series."
4,W.E.B. Griffin Books,"I found out about W.E.B. Griffin a couple of months ago and really enjoy his books. My only complaint is that he hasn't continued the CORPS Series. McCoy, Pick, Banner and Fleming really kept me interested. Maybe not Flem, but the rest could have gone up to the Viet Nam era, or elaborated more until the end of the Korean frackus.Except for his police series, which I haven't started yet, all his book are well written, even those in collaboration with his son. Keep them coming."
4,"Good Exercise, But Only Works With Good Lighting","This game can really get you to work up a sweat. There are many different activities, which makes the replay value pretty high. Some of the games are pretty fun, but some I did not like. The music in the game is average at best. What brings this game down is the Eye Toy itself. In order for the camera to catch your every move, you'll need very good lighting. At my house, the camera did not catch some of my moves, which required me to repeat the same moves over. Due to this issue, I stopped playing after a few weeks. I do recommend this game for people who want to get exercise without spending a lot of money."
5,GREAT WORKOUT,"In case your new to the ps2 eye toy. It is one cool toy. THis is the perfect entry into the eye toy market as well. Kenetic is lots of fun, and you get a great workout. Best of all, you get feedback as to how well you are doing. I am talking stats as to how well you performed today and relative to other outings. All in all it is a great purchase. The camera is placed on top of your tv, and then projects your image onto the screen. Throughout the game you have to do various tasks with your body to move objects around on the screen. This is worth it if you are looking for a solid title for the eye toy, or if you are just looking for a great workout."
5,Overall EXCELLENT Game!!,I've Tried It For A Week And It Was A Really Fun Game And A Great Exercise And Workout Together In The Same Time!!I Liked The Training Routine And The Accuracy Of The Camera And The GameFantastic Product And Excellent Game!!Thnx Amazon!!=)
3,Need great lighting...,"The exercise is good, the graphics are fair, the voices are great but if you don't have great lighting in your home or wherever you setting this up, don't get it. I can use it on sunny days only and my house isn't that dark but dark enough it has trouble picking me up. It's not a bad exercise video at all, in fact the exercise is made into games so it's really fun. Give it a try as long as the lighting is good."
4,GREAT PLUG WIRES,"I WAS HAVING A MISS FIRE ON CYL. 3 AND 6. I TOUGHT IT WAS THE PLUG WIRES SO I REPLACED THEM WITH THESE. I TURNED OUT TO BE MY EGR VALVE. TH EWIRE WORK GREAT. A LITTLE LONG , BUT FIT NONE THE LESS"
3,great size but...,I bought these pans because I can never finish a full size loaf. The smaller size is perfect for slipping a loaf into a lunch sack.The only problem I've noticed is that the corners of the pans are starting to rust after only half a dozen uses.
3,Try Wilton brand,"I've had these pans with the folded edges and I don't like how food gets in the crevices. I've also had the non-stick pans, and I think they over cook quick breads and cakes. I finally found Wilton aluminum pans @candyland.com. They were just what I was looking for."
4,Seneca,"This is a series of 28 books written about a tribe of indian's. The book deflects the life and hard time of the Indian's. In this bookthis tribe fights against the ""Seneca"" tribe. The main character, Reno, is very strong, and skilled, and it shows his thinking on how to win the battle again their enemy the Seneca. The author, Donald Clayton Porter, writes so that you will feel you are right there in the camp with Reno and his family. Although, you can read a book out of sequence, to really get the full effect of the history and follow the geneology of this family of Indian's, start with book 1 and it will be well worth it, especially if you like 'western' type books."
4,"Nice quality, but ridges around cups.","I have not yet used this muffin pan; however, once I received it I was a bit unhappy to find that there are ridges around the edges of the cups. Since I frequently have overflows with my muffins, these ridges will make it harder to clean up. Other than that, the quality seems good. I like that they are not nonstick. They are not oversized cups - which is nice for portion control."
2,Proceed With Caution,"I bought this book to assist in my studying for the English Lit GRE. It wasn't particularly useful given its lack of substance, but more importantly, I noticed multiple errors (incorrect plot summaries, wrong dates, etc.). Stick with Norton."
3,Just for reviewing,"I am a grad student who bought this text to get some help with studying for a major exam. Even thought it was helpful with the ""big picture"", the book is lacking in the more specific details that a more seasoned scholar might need. I recommend this book for undergrads or someone who is looking to return to college, but not for more advanced scholarly research."
5,Excellent,"I bought this as a complement to ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to American Literature."" it gives nice concise information that can be used to further condense the Idiot's guide."
4,Understated and lyrical,"This short story, inspired by one of Van Gogh's lesser known drawings, Peasant with Sickle, Seen from the Back, is a pleasant and low key depiction of an old farmer in the twilight years of his life. This story, while not specifically about Van Gogh at all, uses this simple and poignant drawing as the basis for a lyrical tale of the never-named farmer's lonely but satisfying life. Ulmen's story, with virtually no dialogue, is a study in understatement--a trait many aspiring writers should try to emulate."
4,Fun for everyone,"Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing fans know the drill here, the question is ""how does this me too racer stack up""? The answer: Quite well. It's gorgeous to look at, very fast, has great control, is WELL animated, has great attacks (or 'gags, as they're called here), and well designed tracks. All this makes it a blast to play...I whole heartedly recommend it!"
2,Don't waste your money,"I suppose it sounds nice, your a cartoon driving a space pod using gags to disturb the other racers. Well it really isn't. You may get to use a gag here and there but it seems you'll be the recipient of over 10 a race. You may be gaged once, then immediately have it happen again and then again and the whole time you won't move. The game play is very slow, meaning that you don't move very fast at all. You have an extreme disadvantage the whole game when you only receive the same gag over and over and the computer receives the gags that actually are fun to use. So do yourselves all a huge favor and keep your [money]... . You won't be disappointed if you do not buy this game."
4,What you get is great!!,"This GPS unit works great!. I gave 4 stars because it looks like an Europe modal, so you have to use an adapter(comes with it)every time to charge!. I had no problem using this for 8 hours without recharging, it worked great. I used MS-streets software(I think any standard GPS software will work with this). Overall, I am happy. I tried this unit with my laptop, ipaq H1945 and Dell X50. You may want to consider ""HP iPAQ Bluetooth GPS Navigation System"" if you do not have a software already. It is a similar system with software."
2,Do not buy this nut cracker!!!!!!!!!!!,The design and application make good sense...so I bought it. It broke at the hinge area after cracking about ten paper shell pecans. The metal is inadequate for the stress of nut cracking. If the company corrects that defect I would purchase again because I believe that it has the potential to be a very good nut cracker.
2,great for walnuts only,"Tried a mixture of nuts with this product and found it troublesome to crack the hazel nuts, pecans, and other smooth nuts. The walnut worked great but wanted an easy way to get whole pecans."
3,Works for Hazel Nuts,This is the only thing I have found to work on hazelnuts. Main problem is that they wear out. They aren't designed to do large numbers. Still the best thing out there. I have worn out 5 or 6 over past several years
4,great nutcracker,"Loved this nutcracker - it is easy and nuts come out in halves. We like to make different kinds of nuts - buttered and salted, cinnamin and sugar, etc so having halves it good. Easiest one we have ever had"
1,Sorry,"It is not worth having ,it is to big to use cracking pecans might work fo walnuts or larger nuts.."
1,couldn't crack a nut,We must be missing something. We tried several times and several ways to make this work but to no avail. We have only pecans and perhaps it takes only the walnuts....We will be returning them.
2,Not Best Nutcracker,"Difficult to use.Smaller nuts sometimes impossible to position correctly.Would not recommend or purchase again.Stick to old type nutcracker, works much better."
1,"PIECE OF JUNK! ""Best Nut Cracker""",I actually was cracking walnuts when this item arrived this past Saturday. I literally used it one time on a pecan and the spring dislodged and broke. This is a major piece of junk!!! I just threw it right in the garbage can... six dollars or so in the trash! Do not order this device as you will be disappointed! Made in China! This is exactly what is wrong with our country today. Junk made overseas! I should have known better.
2,Not as good as I remember.,"I've had this type of nutcracker before and it was wonderful. This is a good product, but it doesn't want to crack pecans it seems too big for most of them. It pushes them up. If the bowl was smaller it would work like I remember it. It would be fantastic for walnuts though."
1,Hulk smash - break nut cracker on first use,"At least, before this nutcracker, I never considered myself the Hulk. But the first time I used this thing it made me feel powerful. Why? Because the thing snapped in half on the second nut (and I am positive I did NOT see that on TV). I was really hoping I had found a nutcracker that could handle macadamia nuts -- this is not the one."
2,Nut cracked,"When I ordered this nutcracker I had tried one that my sister had. I loved hers. I don't love this one. It doesn't crack nuts as hers does. It seems that the spring on this one is not as strong, and, I suspect, it is of inferior quality compared to my sister's. Unfortunately, she received hers as a gift.I will say it's easier to handle than the traditional two prong nutcracker."
2,Good engineering/design but poor quality material,"I ordered two of these and both arrived with the wooden handles broken, in the very same place. They were packed in different positions, so it could not have been an impact during shipping. I ordered them because the one I bought in a store a few years ago had broken in a different place, in the metal cup, after many uses, so I thought it was just worn from multiple stresses/impact. It's a great idea, easy to use, but needs to be made with more durable materials. We're cracking NUTS, here, folks, not jelly beans.Also, smaller nuts like hazelnuts might be difficult to crack in this- need to be repositioned sometimes to crack open."
1,Try something else!,"Very poor design, very frail tool, slippery surface. The junction between the wooden and metal parts of the tool is especially vulnerable. As one puts a nut in the cup and tries to crack it, the only output is that the nut would be ejected as a result of the very slippery inner surface. USELESS and a WASTE OF MONEY."
5,Walnut shaped Nut cracker,"This is a great product mainly because of it's shape. The walnut fits in perfectly and the crack is even, not crushed with shell pieces scattered all over. Much better than the lobster cracker that we used for years."
2,Poor Printhead Unit,It did not last as i would like it to. Poor replacement printhead for the hp designjet 130 series. I would recommend you look at other products from epson or canon.
4,Great with Exopat/Silpat,"This pan is the perfect size to fit a Matfer Exopat or a Silpat. No problems with warping.My minor issues are that the glue used to hold the label to pan was incredibly hard to remove. Second, the pan is a bit on the heavy side (if you are trying to one hand it). I can't imagine this being an issue unless you had arthritis or something. Last, the pan being fairly thick (compared to cheapo sheets) stays hot longer than you might expect. I found I needed to reduce the cooking time on my second batch of cookies about 30 seconds. Again, all of these are minor issues."
3,"Good pan, not as good as it was.","I can not say for certain but I believe the product quality has been lowered since I last purchased a couple. The pan is still a good quality but when you cut food on the pan, say a pizza, it puts indentations into the pan."
1,Made in China,"I bought 1 of these pans, and while it is very high quality, I would rather spend just a little bit more and get the same pan made in the USA. These same Chicago Metallic pans are also sold at Williams-Sonoma, but the ones there are made in the USA rather than China. I have already purchased it and will be returning the one that I bought at Amazon."
4,What a difference!,"I've only given this 4 stars, only because I haven't used it for everything it's designed for. I have used it mostly for baking chicken pieces and roasting vegetables. I'm amazed at the difference between other brands. At one point I had 2 pans of chicken pieces in the oven - one Chicago Metallic, and the other a cheaper brand. Not only was the Chicago Metallic easier to clean, but the chicken browned and cooked more evenly and was moist. HUGE difference!"
2,Chicago Metallic Logo Imprint embossed on sheet surface,"The pan I received seems to be of fairly high quality. It's going right back to Amazon unused, however, as it came with a feature not shown in the picture: a logo imprint upraised in the middle of the cooking surface, 1 1/4"" x 3/4"" x 3mm(approx height).This means that it's not perfectly flat in that area--scraping might be problematic. You can probably place some baked goods in a way that avoids the issue, but others might not have that option (I'm a novice baker so I don't know). Worst case, your baked good will be branded ""Chicago Metallic."" Why bother when Lincoln / Vollrath makes perfectly good half sheet pans that avoid the issue?"
3,I have no one to blame...,"Did you read the negative reviews stating buyers received dented pans stuffed in-between good ones? I read them too... and still I bought... and I received dented pans stuffed in-between good ones. Bad form, Amazon."
5,Now we're cooking!,"You would think that a simple baking sheet would be easy for manufacturers to get right. I sure did, at least until I received several non-sticks as gifts in recent years. I was elated at first because non-sticks promised to remain easy to clean as they aged. But to my horror, they also burned every scone and cookie I baked with them. About the only thing that worked in non-sticks was pizza (over a dusting of corn-meal) and by then, I hated their goodie-burning enamel so much that I cut the pizza right in the pans---gleefully scarring their surfaces and hastening the day I would replace them.That day finally came. My wife and I now own 2 Chicago Metallic jelly roll pans and the cookies have never been better: crispy without a trace of charring. We've mostly used a silicon liner, but a couple of times have baked without it. Even then the cookies baked perfectly and clean-up in the dishwasher was a breeze. Simply marvellous!"
4,Excellent Jelly Roll Pan,Best pan I've bought for kitchen. Ordered an additional one after first one arrived. I agree about the glue used to adhere label. Both pans ended up scratched because glue was overkill and extremly hard to remove.
4,Not necessarily 18x13,"This pan has worked well for me. Holds shape very well even under broiler. No warping at all. It does seem to hold on to food stains pretty strongly though. Got a couple I haven't been able to get off.When I ordered this, I received the Chicago Metallic II Commercial Jelly Roll Pan, which is more like 16 1/2 by 11 1/2 or so. I kept the pan anyway because the shipper did not have any of the 18x13 available. I don't know why so many manufacturers skimp on what should be a standard size. It is very annoying though.So -1 star for the staining and the size, the latter of which may or may not be an issue."
3,Fair could be sharper,Bends the plant stem did not cut clean enough for cutting roses for a floral designer who needs a clean cut for flowers so they can drink well!
1,Like a Real Book,"Finally, a print-on-demand book that actually LOOKS like a real book. Decent margins, clear typeface, elegant layout, actual title and contents pages, and some honest breathing space throughout.VERY much worth it."
2,not far enough,"this books contains a few stories, the largest and best being man-wolf, the others are by the way completely uninteresting. they are gothic in style. man-wolf has a good plot, though simple. descriptions are good. but it doesn't go far enough and is filled with unnecessary stuff, like most gothic tales. something strange is going around in a castle. a nobleman is experiencing personality change. it could have been good. it becomes mediocre"
5,read the other reviews and get this!!!,"best of both worlds, 100% pure, no weak link, period, sure to please, if your reading this, and your wanting to buy a cd, you can not go wrong, sum of the eccentric soul series take time to get into, not this one, instant favorite!!"
2,ehhh......,"Ok, this book IS funny, THE FIRST TIME YOU LOOK THROUGH IT!!! Overall, i would not recomend this book because it's one of those books, that you'll just look through one time, and one time only! Yeah....there are a lot of positions, but they are all repeated in the book like five times, with different names! And another thing, there are a lot of positions that are not even posible, and some only with a giant swing, or how about a horizantal or verticle pole...yeah many people have those in their houses. BUT SERIOUSLY, THE ONLY POSITIONS THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO, ARE THE ONES THAT YOU KNOW ALREADY! !!"
3,"Funny, but some of the position are repeated","This is a funny book to ""read"" and more fun to try with your partner or partners. Some positions require 3 or 4 people, just make sure that your health insurance is paid because you may get hurt trying to pull off some of the positions.The only reason I didnt give it a higher rating was because some of the positions were repeated and just named differently. But definitely a good book to have.Enjoy!"
1,A joke book,"Most of the positions in this book are not humanly possible. The authors' intro to the book says it was written simply to catalog as many positions (with clever names) as they could think of. If you are looking for a book that offers sincere advice for positions, look elsewhere."
3,fun...to look at,"This book is full of ridiculous and funny positions...a lot of which seem impossible. None the less, it's great for entertainment or even inspiration. A lot of the postions seem to repeat with only their name being the difference. Good for a laugh."
2,Feminist Conspiracy,"This book, authored by women, illustrates 21 positions in which the man goes down on the woman and zero positions in which the woman goes down on the man. (Unless you count the single illustration of 69, in which case this book illustrates 22 positions in which the man goes down on the woman and one in which the woman goes down on the man.) To add insult to injury, in a few of the illustrations in which the man goes down on the woman, the man appears to be licking the woman's anus. In short, as a man I don't feel that this book has my best interests at heart."
1,Lack of variety,"I would not recommend this to anybody. About 30 percent of the postions are repeat at least once, there are some that are repeated three or four times, just under a different name. This book also doesn't have any information about the positions. I would recommend ""Daily Sex: 365 Positions and Activities for a Year of Great Sex!"" by Jane Seddon."
2,Not what i was expecting..,The majority of the positions are completely crazy and unless you are 100% bendable you are unable to do them! I was under the assumption that it was a true book you would be able to use to help your relationship.
3,Same Things Over and Over,"I purchased this book anticipating a funny and interesting position for every day. The book has some great positions and interesting ones. However, their are several positions that are exactly the same (same photo and everything). The only difference is the name. You do not get the full 365 positions in this book. You get approximately 300."
4,haha,Is what is says it is...365 days of positions. What else do you want me to say? It's made of paper and is paperback.
2,Good Idea....,"I think Mallory and the Dream Horse was a good idea for the BSC series, but it wasn't as detailed as other horse books. I should know that a white ribbon in a horse show is 4th- I have 2 of them! Still, good idea. ALSO- riding instructors should NOT let their riders pick what horse they want to ride; that could be bad for all 3, and maybe even cause fights. The horse and rider's bond wouldn't be as strong, either, and it takes at least a month to get to a canter."
3,it was alright,"Mallory takes horse riding lessons and it doesn't go as well as she thought and the people in her class are snobby. I don't remember much of the book but it was nice to see a book that speaks of mallory's love for horses, since it was mentioned lots of times that she loves to read horse books."
2,"Nice writing style, poor information","I usually enjoy Ann M Martin's books very much, but I'm not too impressed with the information in this book. A previous reviewer pretty much said it all- also I would not be happy to see an instructor that would let a collision almost happen. I know I didn't begin cantering for a few months after I began riding, as did most of the other riders my instructor trains. But I must say that the book has a wonderful writing style for that age group. =O)"
2,Very Poorly Written,"I'd have to say that I am VERY digusted with this book. An avid horse lover and reader, I have been riding since I was 6. Mallory's riding instructor shouldn't have called Mallory's mom--she should have made Mallory get back on unless she was broken or bleeding badly. And it dosen't take 3 lessons to canter. I think the writer should have done a little better job of doing research, even if she dosen't like horses. Some kid isn't gonna get the right information when they read this book. And Thoroughbred and Quarter-Horse are supposed to be capitalized (they are names of a breed)."
5,Cool!,Mallory is taking proffesional riding lessons. It's a dream come true or should i say Mallory has gone crazy. The book was so cool with interesting chapters.
3,"Um Pretty Good, But When You Come To Horses Is It Realistic",Mallory and The Dream Horse was an interesting book but I must say the auther could have gone further into depth on horse resurch. Sine when is a white ribbon sixth and a rider canters on their second day. Gimmie a break people!!!!! It was not the greatest book in the word in my opinion
4,Good pan for breads,"I bake a lot and love this pan for baking loaves that require 8x4 pan. It produces nice crusty breads. However, because of the pan's folded metal construction, not unlike the Commercial Calphalon pans, crusts get stuck in the corners and are hard to clean. It is otherwise a most excellent bread loaf pan."
1,"Fans of non-fat powdered milk, rejoice!","The recipes in Frank C. Daniel's book, The Art of Gelato, all contain powdered milk, corn syrup or other chemical delights. If you want real Italian gelato, made with fresh ingredients, look elsewhere!"
3,A Special Interest Short Instructional,"This is a performance magician's instructional video teaching the levitaion illusion. Basically how to hide the ball of one foot so itappears you are levitating from a particular angle, with a few other psychological gimmics thrown in to aid in the illusion. Nothing mystical,just a ""How to Perform a Levitation Trick"" for an aspiring stage magician. 3 stars because I'm not a student, magician. One viewing was sufficient for the merely curious."
2,Sweet & Savory Whimsical Little Tale,"In a reversal of roles, Lucrezia Borgia, synonymous with the use of poison, plays a detective to clear her name and find out who is killing the people in her court using a poison in medieval times called The Mother of All Poisons. Her buffoon of a third husband triggers Lucrezia's desire to play a detective by accusing her of killing a supposed mistress. All's well that ends well, the killer is found out, the husband, Alfonso, becomes enamoured with her while playing Watson to Lucrezia's Sherlock Holmes."
2,Lucretia misrepresented.,"Lucrezia Borgia is one of the most misrepresented (and unfortunate) figures in history. She was never a poisoner, as anyone with knowlege of this period will know. The making of her into a detective to clear her own name is banal and unhistorical, which is not generally true of Gellis' other novels. Lucrezia lived happily, and in considerable affection with her third husband, who certainly never accused her of murder. This book is not one of Gellis' best and is not typical of her historical novels, which ususally take history seriously."
2,Shallow characters and thin story line,"First, it is only fair that I state that I am not a huge fan of ""whodunnits."" However, I am a huge fan of historical fiction. I found this book to be boring and uninteresting throughout. The characters aren't well developed, the daily routines of Lucerzia Borgia and her two close ladies in waiting and the rest of the court are uninteresting and repetative, and it seems such a shame considering all of the real life drama, mystery and intrigue which surrounded this woman's actual life. The mystery element was uninteresting as well - I felt I was reading a book written for an adolescent audience. I was sorely disappointed in the book."
5,Hats and More Hats.,First copy of this book I bought for the church library. Second copy I am buying is for my four year old granddaughter because I always wear a hat.
1,Miss Fannie's Hat Book,I have never been so disappointed in Ms. Karon. I've read ALL her Mitford Valley series and loved every word and every minute I spent in reading each book. I knew this was a 'single' but still expected more...sorely disappointed.
2,Miss Fannies Hat Book,Would like to have known the length of the book (ie # of pages). Thought book was overpriced. Thought there would have been more to the book than there was.
2,didn't work well at all,I bought this product and both of my cakes stuck to the bottom of both pans . They were not non stick at all . Don't waste your money with this brand.
2,Kinda boring,"The DVD was just a compilation of ""Big D"" haging out in Europe. Little to no concrete information or advice is given. It's also fairly tame concerning nudity or sex. The Prague section is best and the most informative."
1,a major disappointment - not worth your time,"very amateur documentary. Terrible editing. Repetitive. Irritatingly out of focus. One would not think someone could make this topic boring, but this is achieved the seemingly impossible. It was quite difficult to watch the entire thing."
3,Excellent subjects!! Too much details.,"The core subject of this book is really excellent, and the book does really show the cascading impact that these events had around the world, and how this might potentially help to shape our future. I would recommend this book because of the fact that I do not think that any other book covers this subject as well.The only negative comment that I would have, is that the book is really written in the form of an essay, an has way too many granular details. While it is important to understand the core players and events, it might not be necessary be required to list ALL the players and events. The fact that there are SO MANY names mentioned, and SO MANY small and less untactful events listed (so and so received a fax a 7am, read the fax, etc...), makes this book a little bit heavier than it should probably be."
3,You'll have to replace the drawstring,"This cover has been on my AC for a year. It has only been removed twice to use the trailer. The drawstring COMPLETELY rotted away and had to be replaced. And if you don't think THAT was fun, well...Other than that, the basic cover is holding up well. But just be prepared to replace that drawstring or trash the cover if your AC unit is in the sun."
1,Problem with lid,"Chicago Metallic usually makes great pans, but this one fell short of expectations. The lid will not stay on the pan."
3,lid problem,The pan is very nice but the lid is a problem. It doesnt fit right and wont stay on the pan.
4,Good Pan; Useless Lid,"This pan was exactly what I needed for brownies and other baked items, but the lid is essentially useless. I can't get it to stay on. For the money, the pan is still a decent bargain. But why the useless lid?"
4,"Un libro ameno, honesto y escrito como los dioses","Fue una sorpresa agradable conocer este libro de Maruja Torres, donde en forma inteligente y muy honesta recorre treinta años de su trabajo como periodista en España. Es una historia llena de fuerza que nos habla del empuje de esta mujer que va saliendo adelante, que trabaja como una burra y escribe como los dioses. Con un lenguaje sencillo y directo nos va contando cómo se forjó su amor al cine, al Líbano, a América Latina, al periodismo. Siempre con humor y muchas veces con emoción. Finalmente sentimos que vivimos con ella una etapa de la historia irrepetible, tan bien contada..."
3,Times Have Changed,"Well, the excellent song I bought this album for is on there, along with a lot of other...stuff. That's why I rated it average. What struck me as noteworthy is how sleazy the CD medium has become. The CD itself is thin, delicate and flexible. And the hinge on the damn case broke the second time I opened it. I didn't dock the music any points for that but it's no wonder nobody buys these things anymore."
3,Freak out,"OK I know lots of people will hate me for saying this but Billy Corgan is full of it. Granted this album is good. And I'm not trying to bash the Pumpkins. (I have plenty of freinds that are fans that think Corgan is a bit full of himself) This album has some great songs. For it's time I guess it was amazing what with all those Nirvana Jam kids runnning around trying to whine how they don't want to be famous. Buy this album cause it has some pretty good songs. But don't pay full price. Do what I did and get it for 9 or 10 bucks at a used CD store. That way even if you do love it more than I did you'll feel better caused you saved some bucks. So in conclusion I say buy this album for ""Cherub Rock"" and the other five or six songs this album starts with for some wholesome moshing fun. But don't pay full price."
3,Good CD but nothing special,"i'm not an avid smashing pumpkins fan- i like them, but not crazy for them. This cd did not change my feelings. Pretty good cd, but it didn't really jump out at me as anything wonderful."
5,"Smashing, indeed.",The remaster didn't make it sound different enough to where I really noticed much. I just heard the songs sparkle a bit more. The instrumentation was a bit more separated without losing the cohesiveness of the original. The demos are insanely interesting. Hearing what the songs sounded like before the final versions was cool. I loved the tunes that didn't make the cut. I did also hear why they didn't though. Listened to it once a day for the past month. Still listening.
5,An Alt-Rock Masterpiece,"This album is so good, it puts a lump in my throat just thinking about it. Very rarely are there great ""albums"" released anymore, where from the first song to the last, the music is strong and artfully arranged to make one complete ""book"" of music. I love this album, I love this sound. To me, this captures the best of the Pumpkins - the driving guitar and drums. What is that signature Pumpkins distortion on the guitar? Amazing. There's another song out there right now that has a similar sound and screaming vocals. It's not the SP, but it sure sounds like them!"
5,Chamberlain's Album,"SD is their most polished alum. The production is shiny and the playing is stellar. Corgan does his job well, his guitar chops are dead on. But it's really James Chamberlain's drumming that makes this one happen. Mr. Chamberlain is a master of his instrument and trained in the traditional school of drumming- jazz. If you are into rock drumming at all, then you will love this album. If you aren't, then listen to this one more time and pay attention to every little drum lick. Overall, one of the great post punk-punk albums of all time."
3,MBV refined,"Typically in rock music, America invents a sound/genre and then Britain refines it. For instance, Radiohead has taken REM's sound to higher ground. In the case of the Pumpkins, the reverse is happening. My Bloody Valentine and Jesus and Marychain are the obvious influences here, but Corgan has stripped away some layers and has substituted Kevin Shields's shoe-gazing introversion for a more aggressive and adrenilizing demeanor. The results are wonderful - raw, punky, confrontational while sophisticated and coherent. Cherub Rock marries Pixies, MBV and Black Sabbath to create a spellbinding wall of sound. But what gives it coherence and originality is Billy Corgan's voice. Not as crazed as Frank Black and not as subdued as Kevin Shields - it's the voice of a worldly punk-rocker with a mature sensibility. The rest of the album almost fulfills the promise of the first track. It's still a worth having in your collection"
3,good but overall leaves a bad taste,"this is the 1st album i heard from these guys. Well, actually the song Today. i didn't like the video nor the song. same thing with disarm. but i really liked cherub rock and rocket was good too. later i heard mayonaise and liked it.same thing with mellon collie. i heard 1979 and loved it. i heard the rest and couldnt get through it.Well 10 years later i decide to listen to their whole catalog in itunes.um, gish is a terrific album. i like the slow trippy stuff. siamese dream however aside form some good tracks i still dont like. something about the sound of the guitars and the melodies... sounds fake or trendy.mellon collie however took me by surprise. it shows the band really matured and made a whole 2cd set that is ALL good."
5,Great album,"This is a wonderful and ground breaking album. If you are only going to own one Smashing Pumpkins album, I recommend you make it this one."
5,Their last amazing cd.,"Let me start by saying the Smashing Pumpkins were one of my biggest rock let downs. Their first few ep's and full lengths were amazing, I had such high rock hopes for them. Then Billy wanted to be Nosferatu from Salems Lot. I dont understand.That being said, this albums rocks, Billys guitar tone is second to nearly no one, the guy totally tears the fret board into pieces in a beautifully drenched fuzz. The songs are well crafted, well written, well performed, and Corgans hurt little boy voice is perfect.To me, the Pumpkins last great album, this is where their career ended for me.Definitely a must have for a rock collection. If only for the mad guitar clinic Corgan displays like a $1.99 all you can eat smorgasbord."
5,The Best CD ever recorded,"The Smashing Pumkins have done the seemingly impossible:they have created the perfect album. Siamese Dream is by far my all time favorite CD. Since buying this outstanding CD, I haven't gone more than a week without listening to songs like Mayonaise and Geek U.S.A. If you have only heard songs like Today, you haven't really had the Smashing Pumpkins experience. This is by far the best CD made by the world's greatest rock band. Five stars just isn't enough to rate such an awesome album."
1,Who knew a crabby 2 yr old could front a band,Vomitfest would be perfect description to describe this album of noise flooded with the whiney brat melodies of Billy Corgan.
1,this band is sickening,All grunge is sick and gross and horrific sounding trash. When i watched the videos to this group it just seemed satanic and the visuals were like a timeless deformity had swallowed the universe. one of their videos was about the 70s. I dont remember the 70s being like hell. i remember the 70s being soulful and fun. this group is a green stain and icky stench.
1,one of the most overrated bands,"After hearing this pukefest of an album, I can completely understand why William Hung can get a contract.A 2 year old toddler screaming sounds better than this garbage.Makes me wanna put on Motley Crue's Girls Girls Girls, and hear some real Rock!Thank god for bands like the Darkness and Jet, for bringing the fun back in rock."
1,This is NOT art.,"Despite all the rave, this is still just a piece of crap...in a cage? The music is pretty dang good but the vocalist is beyond gay and always has been...let's not forget he's the guy who started Zwan...ZWAN for god's sake!!! This man should not be revered as a rock legend...or ANYTHING to do with rock for that matter. This is pure file 13 but the mass mind is too stupid to realize."
1,This may have been their breakthrough on the charts but.....,"It sucks big time!!!!!!! Alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in Hell...I mean Florida. The first song I heard from this was ""Today"", and I thought it was good the first time I heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that I heard, but then when I heard the entire song it was depressing, and then there was ""Disarm"" which I hated from day one, and the same with ""Cherub Rock"". I just felt like I shouldn't have even bought this at this particular time in my life, but I guess I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, with one song barely tolerable which is ""Mayonaise"" I'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90's."
5,Smashing,"Loud guiters, a winney voice, contant loud banging of drums but this band has a sound unlike any other. Its not anoying, its not britney spears, and its not Rob Zombie. It can only be described as the Smashing Pumpkins. If you had never heard this band or only owned one of their albums this should be the one to buy. This is an album you put in and just let go because every song is good. All the songs are different so it doesnt seem repetative like others. It goes from exciting to relaxing on a roller coaster that ends in thought. The band seems to have a perfect balance so that no matter what the mood of the song is, it still all fits together. Not only can this band play great but Billy Corgan is a great song writer that seems to have a mental balance of emotions with every song he sings and with lyrics that make you think. I think this album shows the band at there best yet and this album is worth the money.I hope to hear more S.P. music soon."
5,Dunky M. Monkey's 5 star review,"This album is a masterpiece. I guess I was about 10 or 11 when it came out, and it never left my tapeplayer. This is Smashing Pumpkins when they were at their best during the early 90's grunge era. It fits in with a long string of great albums that came out around that time. I've strayed away from some of the more recent pumpkins albums such as Adore and mellon collie as they seem to be lacking the pumpkins oringinal greatness. Forget whatever music category this album is lumped into like ""grunge"" or ""alternative rock"" it is simply great music. Corgan's singing and the pumpkins creativity and talent on this album are tops. I'd recommend this album to anyone who has an interest in music."
5,One of the best!!!!!!!,"This CD is a classic, to quote the salesperson that sold it to me ""this CD is beautiful""."
4,Awesome,"I love this CD! It only rated 4 stars because of ""playability"". You really can't listen to it over and over. Gotta take a break from it for a bit or the songs all start to sound the same."
4,Billy Corgan - when he still had hair,"Quite simply, this is the 'pumpkins and Billy Corgan's finest album. While Mellon Collie established SP as rock gods, it was 1993's Siamese Dream that was the inspiration. ""Cherub Rock"" is a solid rock opener, followed by the darker ""quiet"" and then by the delightful ""today"".The album really hits full pitch with the beautiful, but controversial ballad ""Disarm"" and epic piece ""Soma"".""Mayonaise"" and ""Spaceboy"" keep the feeling of the album until the very end - possibly the greatest love song ever, with ""Luna""Straight up this is an album that showcased rock when rock was good.""I go along, Just because i'm lazy, I go along to be with you"" - Luna"
5,*** Pure Bliss ***,"Far and away one of the five best albums of the '90's.Has always been, and always will be, simply incredible.Just do it - drown yourself in this blissfully layeredwall of sound. I will never tire of this masterpiece..."
5,This is the best music by anyone since the 1800s.,"I believe this is the greatest music since the likes of Mozart. Corgan is one of the greatest musicians and for the rest of the band members, they are cool and kick but just don't have the mind that Corgan does. I listened to this album and I said right away that is was the best I have heard. The Pumpkins may not have Hendrix as a guitarist and Liszt as a keyboardist but they are, in my opinion the band of the decade."
5,Read this now! ( I only said that to get your attention ),"Sad songs, happy songs, angry songs, and ""puffy"" cloud-like songs. Steady melodic bass lines + Crackling drumwork + Brilliantly written solos + Billy Corgan's musical genieus + James Iha's musical talent=Siamese Dreams.Billy, James, Jimmy, and D'arcy take you on a bullet train to the human sole. This album contains the embodyment of every emotion you will ever feel. Sadness, love, anger, meloncholly, glee, and even awe(as in the awe of the album's power).James' guitar pick flys over the strings as he unleashes the beautiful solos. Jimmy's snare drum echos the beat of D'arcy's lullabying bass. Billy's voice goes from deep and sad, to loud and angry, to high and sweet. The Pumpkins are the best in the buisiness. This album is great in the car, at parties, or just to rock you to sleep. As a music fan I can't sing its praises enough. As a guitar player, musician, and a song writer, I have never been more inspired! - Tim(california, U.S.A.)"
4,Good example of alt-rock,"I approached this album with trepidation when I listened to it in 1994 after Kurt Cobain died. I had heard so much about the Smashing Pumpkins being the next big thing that I was preparing myself for the inevitable let-down. Even though the album was produced by Butch Vig, I wasn't taking anything for granted. But I found this album to be a delight, not so much for Billy Corgan's lyrics, which do not speak for a 30 something like myself, but for the sheer wave of music. Song after song, this album is packed with chops, hooks, and buzzes. ""Today"" and ""Rocket,"" for example, are perfect pieces of ear candy. For his part, Corgan's whine plays off well against the sonic boom surrounding him, like a wolf howling against the wind on a stormy night. Only the overlong ""Sweet Sweet"" feels out of place amongst the other, tighter songs. If you aren't an alternative rock fan but wish to discover what the music is all about, you can't do much better than this album."
5,Siamese Dream,"It's the [new millenium] now. I have just recently got on therock scene, albeit i've been listening to punk and ska for a whilenow. [Over] seven years later, Siamese Dream still stands the test of time. Siamese is quite possibly the best SP album, perhaps the BEST album of the 90's through today. The best song on this album is probably Disarm, the music makes you speechless. YES IT'S THAT GOOD. The only other album in my opinion that can even compare is Green Day's Dookie. This album has got the song for your every mood. From Disarm to Spaceboy, you can't go wrong. My suggestion: you hurry and ... buy this CD. I said... NOW. I mean it!"
5,The Smashing Pumpkins at their best!,"Though it doesn't have the Pumpkins' best song (in my opinion) ""Tonight, Tonight"". This is almost undoubtedly their best album yet. Every song on this cd rocks! It may take a while to liking some of the songs, but after a week you'll enjoy every last song. If you don't have it, I strongly recomend that you get, it's worth every penny. The Best songs are: Cherub Rock, Today, and Disarm. My personal favorite is suprisingly to me ""Mayonaise"" (no it's not about mayonaise)it's a very touching song like disarm. (This from I guy who likes Korn)"
5,In My Top 10,I heard this CD in 94 and here it is the year 2000 n' I'm still talking about how great a CD this is. It is a standard for anyone into altenative.From Cherub Rock to Luna you are exhilarated at the same time stricken to sorrow. You really can't ask for a better CD. If you are just starting to get into this group you cannot get a better entry into one of the best bands ever.We will miss the Smashing Pumpkins.
5,best cd in the whole world,this is the best cd in the whole world ive been listening to it for the past five years.. and its sooooo great.
5,Greatest album ever recorded,"No joke, i've owned this album since it came out in 93'and it has stood the test of time. Maybe even becoming better, expecially in comparison to all the crap new bands are putting out on the radio now a days. Every song on this album is great in its own way and they were all perfectly placed. This is as close to music prefection as has ever occured. Amazing lyrics, and fantastic guitar and everything else i don't see what they could have done to have made this album any better. After owning this album for 7 years i still say i average listening to it about 3 times a week. I can't say that about anyother album i own. My personal favorites on this one are Cherub Rock, Quiet, Soma, Geek USA, and Mayonise. But the others i didn't mention are excellent as well. So if you don't own this album you have no idea what you have been missing out on. I say get even if it costs you 100 dollars its well worth it."
4,Some people just don't know what they're missin'!,"The Pumpkins' Siamese Dream is a lovely rock album with its fuzzed-out guitar wanderings and beautifully-bizarre lyrics that only us Pumpkins fans can appreciate, and dare I use the L-word... Love? Of course, the same can be said about their debut Gish, but Siamese Dream has a slightly delicate edge to it that makes it more dear to me. ""Today"" and ""Disarm"" are my absolute favorites, but there are quite a few gems in there alongside material that sounds like a massive wall of noise to an unfamiliar listener. The person below who only likes the Siamese Dream singles is missing out on more than they realize when they say they aren't going to try listening to another certain Pumpkins album. That's a hint to run over to a place that lends out CDs (like your library) and borrow ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness""! It's such an amazing double disc set! ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"", ""1979"", and ""Tonight Tonight"" are nary impossible to not enjoy!"
5,On e of my best cd's!!!11,"This album from the smashing pumpkins,is the best that they have made.I like all tracks but espacialy track3,4,7,9"
5,One of the best albums every made!,"Well, I have to admit that I am a bit biased because my favorite band is the Pumpkins, and because several of the other ""best albums ever made,"" in my eyes, are by the same band. This album gave birth to the Pumpkins as we know them today with such hits as Today and Disarm. There is a bit of everything on this CD, starting with the hard in Cherub Rock all the way to the other extreme in the melodic Mayonaise. This is a fantastic CD! A definite must-have for anyone's collection."
5,"A dense, complex, striking album","Siamese Dream is an outstanding album. Its strengths are not immediately apparent, for the album is so thick with sound that it takes some time to pick up the melodies and lyrics. But after a while, it becomes almost addictive. The songs are complex and moving. ""Cherub Rock"", the opener, is a loud and catchy rock ballad; ""Today"" is one of the greatest songs of the decade, and ""Disarm"" is a haunting acoustic number that seems to be a metaphor about losing childhood. Though those previous three songs were the album's big hits, there are other phenomenal points, especially ""Geek U.S.A."", which shows the Pumpkins knack for contrast, alternating between various ""songs"" (think Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody""). True to Pumpkins' nature, most of the album has a melancholy, angst-ridden feel, though there are some glimmers of positive to be found. Overall a truly remarkable album, the one that really launched the Pumpkins' career."
4,A modern day masterpeice!,"All the songs are good on here. The reason I gave it four stars though, is because a couple of the songs are too draggy and they stretch them out too much. But I highly recommend getting this c.d.! It's a modern day masterpeice!"
5,GREAT THEIR BEST,This Album was excellent I love everysong Silver f*ck was one of my faves and the always classic Today
5,Excellent Rock album,"Siamese Dream by the Smashing Pumpkins is by far one of the best psychadelic/alternative albums ever made, and probably the best album to come out of the 90s. Like the title suggests, this is a very dreamy album. The psychadelic, distorted, whirling guitar riffs are present throughout, as are mind-blowing guitar solos. The album is a blend of metal and psychadelic rock. Throughout the 90s, the Smashing Pumpkins released some dark, gloomy albums such as Melon Collie and Gish. These albums are not very consistent, and the depressing feel makes them a bit cheesy. However, Siamese Dream is not at all depressing or gloomy since the songs are generally uplifting, and is very consistent. Each song is great and technically the album is perfect. Corgan's lyrics are brilliant, the guitar playing is superb, the dreamy feel is very effective, and Jimmy Chamberlain's drumming is outstanding. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!"
5,!!why do you not own this yet!!,"!!!YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ALBUM IF YOU HAVENT DONE SO, IDIOT!!!how can you say your an grunge and/or indies dude if you don't even own this album. this album is the ultimate grunge album (right next to pearl jams TEN and nirvanas NEVERMIND). Siamese Dreams is an 90's classic , SP classic , rock and roll classic , and a simple classic (yes classic is over rated today).The tracks are simply awsome. nice, emo, fat distortion, with awsome lyrics. All tracks are done to the best. from intro of Cherub Rock to the outro of Luna. from heavy Silverfuc to ballad Disarm. This album is simple great. the only thing that is a miss is Space boy, sorry never listened to it for years.well well well well worth your money. Pumpkins best. Indies and grunge classic. get this album get this album (who would hate it, pop hiphop people?)"
3,Change the title for boring lake!!,"C'mon, the only good thing in this version is the soundtrack... And of course the dancers, but for me it was nonsense, I didn't understand the story that well, maybe cause I lost interest and started to chat on Facebook. But have to admit that in the part where the swans are dancing its a good part!!"
3,This swan doesn't age too well,"I watched the PBS broadcast of Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake back in 1996 and I was overwhelmed. Using male to play the swans was such a refreshing concept back then and I loved the ballet even with its apparent weak choreography.This new blu-ray version turns out to be a disappointment. The choreography still didn't go beyond mimicking swan movements, the dancing was quite clumsy. The show became much more provocative, it literally turned into an S&M; show. All characters were self-centered and mean. The degree of the display of mean spirit was mistaken for the measurement of individuality and charisma.There were many pop culture references in the ballet, they just made the ballet feel dated. Homoeroticism doesn't make a ballet classic, while good choreography does."
5,ONE OF THE VERY BEST IN BALLETS,No lover of ballet should miss this stunning production. It's a pity that it will not be released in 3D as it was recently in the cinemas.Matthew Bourne is one of the most brilliant ballet directors in the world today.The high price of the bluray may put people off buying it however. There have been numerous productions of SWAN LAKE but nothing compares with this one. It is even better than the Chinese SWAN LAKE ACROBATICS ballet which is also on dvd and worth watching if you can get get a copy from China.
5,"Southern Baptist Alert: Controversial, Yet Highly Entertaining!","Matthew Bourne's ""Swan Lake"" will not appeal to some...especially anyone living in the Bible-Thumping Bible Belt of the United States. However, I totally enjoyed Bourne's version of Swan Lake, replete with it's homoerotic male-on-male dance partnerings and darker than dark plot. Truly, this version will not be for everyone...but, then again, neither is ignorance and bigotry. 5 Stars! Buy it, and enjoy!"
3,Madden Slide,"This is definitely a nice looking slide, but, like most Madden shoes, are not the epitome of comfort. My feet are on the narrow side, but the upper feels tight especially around my toes. They will not stretch because they are not leather. Not a shoe for walking a lot or wearing for a long time!"
2,Order one size up !,These shoes are too cute! But even though I ordered a half size bigger than usual they were still too small. Order a whole size bigger. Overall very cute slides .
5,"If you like saying ""WHAT THE HELL?!"" After everysong..","..Then this album is for you! these guys are some of the best musicians i've heard in any genere. The time changes are as tight as can be. The singer has one of the most harsh and intence, yet haunting and beautiful voices i've ever heard. I hate to use the term mathcore, but if your in to the dillinger escape paln you'll probly get a kick out of these guys! So far, me and my 3 friends are the only people i know who are even aware this band exsits! Hopfuly a lable will find them soon, their new album is DONE!!!"
4,Great size....but it sticks just a bit.,"This size loaf pan is great for our homemade sourdough. Unfortunately, it the loaf sticks a bit, but hopefully that will improve as is seasons."
1,Cooks good but really hard to clean,I cooked meatloaf in this once and have been trying to get it clean ever since.It sat with water in it for a little bit and now it seems to have rusted in some places. Not happy.
2,Too bad it was shot on video,"Thing is, this had the potential to be a masterpiece. But, realistically speaking, how many masterpieces have you seen shot on video as opposed to film? I'm talking home camcorder, with home camcorder sound. As much as I'd like to say that the substance, camera angles, acting, etc are what counts, camcorder sound and video destroy the illusion that 35mm creates."
1,Terrible,"I don't have particularly high standards, but this was worse than shot-on-video; it had soap opera production values. It wasn't scary or atmospheric or even a guilty pleasure. Nothing was interesting or compelling; you just sit there, wondering why you're watching it, and then eventually turn it off. A chore to watch."
1,Couldn't agree more!!,"Man,I couldnt agree with the other reviewer more - this has to be one of the worst pieces of crap i've ever sat thru.The glacial pacing makes the prospect of watching paint dry much more exciting.I simply dont see how this thing has achieved such a level of notoriety,other than how incredibly dreadful it is! Perhaps it was banned as a form of public service?Again,the only thing here that is the least bit offensive is how slow,boring,and tedious this ""movie"" is.There are absolutely no redeeming atributes to this thing: beware at all costs!!"
4,It's a family matter,"This 1974 T.V. program is an interesting look at life on the rails. As the previous reviewer stated, this disc is certainly worth purchasing. The re-enactments are not cheesy, and Johnny brings an element to this topic that you won't see anywhere else. Whether you're a fan of Johnny Cash, or the railroad, it's a must. The issue right now has Rhino working with the Cash family estate trying to work out a deal to release this. Apparently, both sides want this done, & the aim right now is a June 7/2005 target date. Whether that happens remains to be seen."
5,"Hey, Netflix got it!","What a delight! Just got a copy of this from Netflix! Wow, does this bring back memories!!! As a child my father made a tape recording of the audio from this show and we would listen to it again and again...Johnny Cash brings to musical life the rise and fall of the American Railroad Experience. Each vigniette is framed by the Man in Black singing his own classics like, ""John Henry"" and (of course) ""Ridin' The Rails"" and covers such as ""The Night We Drove Old Dixie Down"" and ""City of New Orleans"" At over 30 years old, it's pacing feels a bit strange and rushed compared to modern documentataries - but viewed as an extended music video, it is great fun.Can't wait for Amazon to have it in stock and own a copy."
3,Ride this train if you really want to,"Truth is, this is a 1970's made-for-tv film and not much more. The production is minimal, though the trains in the film are fascinating. The treatment of the music is somewhat disappointing. The album version of ""The Legend of John Henry's Hammer"" is fuller and more dramatic than the acoustic rendering of the same here. And his ""Ride this Train"" travelogues from his television show are more interesting than what's presented here. I would recommend this DVD for collectors or children interested in trains."
3,For Die-hard fans only,This is a train documentary featuring Johnny cash filmed in the 70's. No concert or concert footage here. Johnny cash talks about the evolution of trains and sings some train songs along the way.
4,It's a keeper,"We've had our tv just under a year and it's working like a champ. The picture is great and sound is fine. I guess my only complaint would be after you hit the on button, it takes it's time to turn on (about 5 seconds). Other than that....it's a keeper."
1,"Lots of features, good price, ... pathetic picture quality","I purchased one of these sets ... because of the excellent price and feature set. However, I quickly found that you get what you pay for. The picture tilted on the left hand side of the screen and also cut off a noticeable part of the left of the image. Philips tech support could only recommend that I return the unit."
1,"Good, Bad, Worse, WORST TV!","It first it worked great! But like anything new it took my time and effort to install it. Within weeks it was getting bad color halos on the screen. I called and Target said it was my cable - it was loose and maybe not coming in right. OK I checked out everything and all aspects with the cable were OK BUT the set was still not looking right! BUT this all took my time! So I kept it a while longer and then just like one of the other reviews the TV started cutting off. At first this was infrequent and then this got worse! It is so bad that I decided to look at this site and make a report before I returned the set. Hopefully, since it is within 90 days they will give me my money back. This set obviously has a number of defects and makes me think that for whatever the price it is NOT WORTH the hassle! My advice is that if anything looks bad it is going to get worse so bring it back quickly before the in store warrantee runs out!"
1,junk junk junk,"This television sells at [a local store] new for [$$$] This is the worst television I have ever purchased. I have had to exchange (3) of them. I am on the (4th) one all of them exhibit the same problem, after you have had them for about 30 days they start to shut off by theirselves. Then they start to loose there color settings, then every time you turn it on. It waits about 15 seconds then shuts off ..."
1,Do not buy,"This is an attractive TV, with a easy-to-use remote, good settings capability, and many features. I was very happy with it for the first 3 months I owned it, then the picture quality started to deteriorate and has rapidly grown worse.After 6 months of use, the TV had a pink semicircle band on the right side of the screen and a green semicircle band on the left side. At the moment, there is still an hourglass shaped area down the middle of the TV that is showing real life colors. This problem can be caused by placing speakers too close to a TV (this is the customer service response which I have recieved), but I didn't have speakers in the same room as this TV.I have been following up with Philips and Best Buy, but at this point the customer service from both has been poor.I recommend avoiding Philips products, especially this model."
2,"Cheap, low power","100 watts for a gun isn't much power. I mainly wanted it to use on my guitars but it doesn't get hot enough to connect the wires to the back of the potentiometers (and yes, the tip was screwed in tight). All three tips are the same and are not very precise.Very cheap unit. Okay for small wiring but any mass will not heat up enough for solder flow."
5,Compact Cookie Sheet,"These pans are exactly what I hoped they would be. I wanted solid, compact, NO non-stick baking sheets. I live in an apartment with a tight kitchen and a small dishwasher. The pan-size isn't the most practical for turning out batches of cookies but it is necessary for easy storage in my ridiculously narrow and short cupboards. I use the pans for making a quick batch of oven fries or dinner rolls. The pans also fit upright in my dishwasher like a plate."
4,Something different,I gave this cd a 4 star rating because of the mix of well known band members getting together to make this collection of music.A welcome edition to add to anyone's music collection.
3,Heaven & Earth by Erv,Great guitar work on the whole album. Great version of Still Got the Blues. Great vocal & instrumental work all the way around. The only reason it doesn't get a higher rating is some of the original songs are not very memorable.
3,A Solid Effort!,"In her latest respected work, futurist Hazel Henderson calls for a win-win world founded on cooperation, not domination. She provides a rich, fascinating, detailed, and thoroughly researched and cited look at the waning days of our current dysfunctional global paradigm. Then she looks ahead for a peek at the possible future of a new, healthier paradigm. Though it was justly well-reviewed, this book is not light reading. It is written in conversational language, but it has a scholarly depth and reach. It is a book to study, not flip through. Henderson calls for a complete redesign of every societal system imaginable - from economic and political to social and ethical - all with an eye toward sustaining a global economy and a more humane world view. We at getAbstract highly recommend this book to readers interested in economic, global, environmental, social, political, and ethical issues."
4,WORTH THE MONEY,I live in the uk and for me these films are worth every penny.Rarely seen over here this is a must buy for uk horror fans.
1,Zero Stars!,"I would take the advice of another review, and not get it. I am happy one person was able to use the mirror ball, but from the get go, it was not working, I got the battery compartment door, however, but the motor was not working, and the ball was not steady and was hanging to one side. I only got this for I want that 70's white light spinning around as opposed to modern day colors spinning around, and I alrieady got a modern day color spinning around, and this was the only tabletop being sold. The other mirror balls I was looking at on here and other sights that are tabletop, spins colors and not just white.I would avoid getting this, just to wait to receive it, and have to return it. But I can at least take comfort in getting a much needed refund! Ya live and ya learn! **SIGH**"
4,Great Little Stereo,"Previous reviews had me skeptical, but this thing is great.Sure you can hear the cd changer when it is switching disks, show me one where you can't in this price range. Sound is good, clear and loud, Ipod navigation via the main unit of the stereo is very good and intuitive.Speakers are very lound but do not give distorted sounds at a lound level. The only thing I don't like about the RS2130i is that when you choose your ipod as the source, it automatically starts playing from the top of either your album, artist or song list. So whatever begins with A, plan to hear when you turn on your ipod.I've only had it for four days so far, I'll report back later. So far so great."
3,A few notes on the stereo...,"I've had this stereo for about a year now, and it works okay for what I use it for, but it has a few problems. Two things about it that I haven't seen mentioned bother me about it.1. When you playback a CD, it pauses between tracks. This is not too much of a problem on most albums, but for things like Pink Floyd or live recordings, it becomes very annoying.2. The volume knob is very tricky. For instance, if you turn up the volume slightly, barely moving the knob, and let it go too early, it will actually turn the volume down. The volume also jumps a bit between levels, it can be hard finding a good ""in between"" volume setting.The sound is very good (if not well balanced, sometimes the bass sounds overpowered and unnatural), and it is somewhat clear sounding. The USB port is very good for Vinyl>MP3 transfer (which is what I use the stereo for)."
2,Poor product experience but great Amazon service,"I ordered this item as a gift. Despite ordering mid December, it arrived on time for the holidays.Unfortunately, the item was broken on arrival, the CD changer would grind when attempting to insert or switch to CD 4 or 5 and flashed ""CHANGER ERROR"".The Ipod dock worked as expected with a Nano 2G, though the connector was a bit snug. Getting the Ipod on the dock took effort to line up correctly.Pros:Decent sound.Ipod play via remote worked.Charged Ipod.Nice sized remote, large buttons.Cons:Can't switch CDs without stopping CD play back.CD drive is loud, even when playing audio CDs.Unit was a cooling fan that can be heard.It was broken out of the box!Returning to Amazon for a refund was hassle free, thanks Amazon!"
4,Metallic non-stick pan,"I've used this several times and just love it. I've baked lasagna, cinnamon rolls, casseroles, etc. It works great and REALLY is non-stick!"
1,For the Tormented Junior High Wannabe Punk,"Edgy in that annoying Lisa Lampanelli way. Its like if you took a really long mad-lib and filled it with the word f*** and other ""shocking"" expletives. I would have probably thought this was a good book back in my angsty middle school years; however, if you are an adult over the age of 18 and have an appreciation for satire and REAL envelope pushers, dont waste your money. Id suggest reading ""Choke"" or ""Invisible Monsters"" by Chuck Palahniuk if thats what youre in the market for. Also, I am sorry my apostrophe button is on the fritz."
5,"Holy dog-vomit Batman, a kindred spirit!","Call me a plagiarist, but I assure you, there was a smoke-filled night some time ago before I read this when I penned a screenplay starring Jesus Christ as a zombie slaying do-gooder cast against the evil clone of himself whose very touch did wake the dead in a much more sinister sense of the phrase. Although the novel presented here does not necessarily reflect my concept of the story, it was good enough for me. If you're a fan of hellaciously rad books, or just some dude sitting and smelling the intermittent wafting of butt odor from your own sweaty crevices, this will definitely not only rock your world, it may affect you like some people say only Jesus can."
3,weird and confusing,"cm3 typically writes pretty good stuff. i am not a huge fan of the bizarro lit movement but have always enjoyed his work, until this one. It is very strange and has some interesting ideas, but there are multiple characters with the same name, and so much stuff going on that it ends up being confusing in the end. i would reccomend satan burger or fishy fleshed for anyone wanting to read his work for the first time...this one is just too much"
5,FREAKEN AWESOME,"This is easily one of the most creative ideas I have come across in my entire life. If for any reason you feel the need to read, even a slight itch, scratch it. Carlton Mellick is one of the greatest authors of our times and his ideas are wicked and original."
1,Terrible book,"The idea on the back cover is intriguing, but the introduction states that this book was written before the author was 18 years old. Terrible book, a lot of mindless cursing which does not effectively cover up the mindless plot. Truly written by a teenager."
2,Electric Jesus Corpse,"It's over my head. I admit it!! Didn't understand it. Author himself stated you might think it's garbage. Liked the title. 2 stars for teenage exuberance. I DO think you should read THE BABY JESUS. Would've read it sooner if I'd know how funny it is! Title's flamboyant..can't possibly be good! Wrong! it's..hysterical! Twisted sense of humor. Pokes fun at idolatry, religious fanatics, gerbalism, folks who ""throw baby out with the bath water"". Try to catch CM3's wild readings sometime. Saw him at the Gross Out competiton at World Horror Con."
3,A Chaotic Slop Of Experimentation,"This book is okay. It is kind of cute. I like the concept. I like the imagery. I'm glad it exists, but it is very hard to get into and isn't as fun as all of the other books I have read by this author. He wrote it when he was 18 and it shows in the writing. Don't expect a masterpiece. Even in the introduction to the book the author says it wasn't meant to ever get published. Read Satan Burger or The Baby Jesus Butt Plug instead. If you like all of Mellick III's other work and are curious to see what he was doing as a teenager, check this one out. It's interesting to see how his style evolved. But be warned, Electric Jesus Corpse is a chaotic slop of experimentation. Some of it is good and some of it is terrible. It's impressive work for an 18-year-old but it's not even half as good as his newer books. If I picked this book up first I never would have read another book by Mellick III. That would have been a shame because he's probably my favorite author."
4,fun! fun!,"My daughter got this when she was 9 or 10. She is now almost 12 and still uses it. It is true that the nail polish is not the same quality as adult polish, but because it is thick and opaque it makes it easier to do the designs. Even if the polish runs out, the book with the designs and instructions can still be used. My daughter is always using it to decorate her own and her friends' nails. It probably helps if your child has fairly good fine motor skills."
2,Not what it appears to be,"Nice try, but this is a disappointing item. The nail polish is not real polish. It washes off with water or you can peel it off. So the great design you worked so hard on is not going to last. My daughter said 'no fun!'"
2,The art is cool the polish isn't,I recieved this itema s a gift. I thought it would be great I was wrong! The designs it gives you are really cool but the ploish that comes with this is awful!!!!!!!!!
3,unexpected deceptions [no spoilers],"""The Sicilian"" occurs around World War II and follows a young Sicilian man's development in fame and power as a revolutionary figure. Unlike the concise chapters found in ""The Godfather"", repetitive definitions and remarks fill an otherwise adequate story surrounding the harsh Sicilian conditions.Although the premise touts a connection with ""The Godfather"" and Corleone in three of the four paragraphs, those anxious to experience more of Michael's exile in his motherland and/or after the conclusion of the acclaimed novel will be displeased. Salvatore ""Turi"" Guiliano is the primary character, leaving Michael in a mere cameo role weakly connecting the two novels. The author should have omitted any association and built a better novel focusing on character background and relationship development.Thank you."
5,"Mario Puzo's epic tale of friendship, deceit and love","90 out of 100 have heard of ""The Godfather"", but not many people know of ""The Sicilian"", Mario Puzo's epic tale of friendship, deceit and love and follow-up to ""The Godfather"". Set during the middle of GODFATHER, Michael Corleone must help legendary Salvatore Guiliano, a Robbin Hood-esque bandit trying to escape to America. Excellent, dramatic, action-packed, clever and at times extremely sad; a highly recommended read."
2,Book club selection,This is just not my type of book but I read it for book club. It seemed it was either loved or hated.
2,The Sicilian by Mario Puzo,"I think my expectations were too high having just finished reading The Godfather and believing the The Sicilian was a sequel.While there were a few references to some Godfather characters, they really played no real role in The Sicilian and it just rambled on and on with no satisfactory outcome - kind of like the movie Godfather III."
4,Would have preferred it not being tied in to the Godfather series...,"This is quite a good story of organized crime in Sicily after WWII. It's a satisfying story, and has lots of Puzo-esque betrayal and dramatic twists.But the manner in which it is stapled to the Godfather is somewhat clumsy and entirely unnecessary. I am guessing that this was done to increase sales by having it be part of the Godfather series (this I can understand) but having Michael Corleone be essentially an interested bystander that we occasionally check in with...seems to dilute the Godfather series while simultaneously making the events of the book more implausible.Regardless, it's an impressive tale of Dons, corrupt politicians, corrupt police and heroes operating outside the law. One plot twist in particular seemed a little forced and abrupt (you'll probably know it when you see it) but it doesn't bring the book itself below the four-star level."
5,A trip into gangster past,This is a great book! This book tells the reader all you need to know about what it was like for Sicilians before and after world war ii. I would also recommend reading the godfather since the events in this book take place in his childhood home.
5,Robin Hood and the Sicilian Mafia....Great Book!,"I read this book after finishing Puzo's remarkable Godfather novel. The Godfather was great, but this book was awesome. I loved every part of the book. Granted, it takes time for the character development and the action to begin. But once Turi gets going, you can't stop him. I fell in love with all the characters in this book. Puzo is excellent at creating a character that you love to cheer on. If you like The Godfather this book will give to the same exciting feeling during your reading. To my surprise this book has not yet become a motion picture. It would be an excellent film. Great characters, good film, deception, love, light sex, adventure, the true Sicilian Mafia. Finally, this book was sick!!"
3,Pretty good.,"It was a pretty good book, but not one of his bests. His best books are The Godfather, Fools Die, and The Last Don."
2,poor sequel,"THE SICILIAN HAS BEEN TOUTED AS A SEQUEL TO THE GODFATHER.BUT ACCORDIN 2 ME,ITS A REALLY POOR SEQUEL.INSTEAD OF INTRODUCING A NEW CHARACTER,PUZO SHUD HAVE SHOWN THE EXPLOITS OF MICHAEL AS THE NEW DON.THE MAIN WEAKNESS OF THE BOOK IS,IT IS VERY SLOW .I ENJOYED ONLY THE MICHAEL CORLOENE PART."
4,The Sicilian,Very good book. I also enjoyed the movie .very interesting story. I have read all of Mario Puzo novels this is one of his best.
4,The Sicilian,Held me throughout waiting for the next turnCan not wait to see the real country sidethe history of the region is classic
3,The Sicilian,Enjoyable read with lots of twists and turns and kept me captivated to the very end. Would highly recommend this book.
4,Good read,Enjoyed the history of Sicily and enjoy Mafia stories. Godfather was my favorite movie of all time and I liked that it tied back to the corleone's but was a story on its own
2,Not worth the wait,"I wasn't quite halfway throughThe Sicilianby Mario Puzo when I was locked up, and it was nearly a decade of incarceration before I came across a copy of it. My expectations were up, and I was let down. The novel is about a young Sicilian revolutionary who fights against the mafioso establishment and police corruption that keeps his family and fellow countrymen perpetually indentured. I wanted to like this novel, but it was lackluster at best, and not even cameo-type appearances by the character Michael Corleone from Puzo's far superior novelThe Godfathercould save it from being a disappointment."
5,I use it constantly. Better than anything!,"I'm a fairly serious cook, so I need to measure a lot. I use this beaker whenever I can, for both wet and dry ingredients.It has several advantages: (1) it's narrower at the bottom, so when measuring a small quantity you get extra accuracy; (2) it has a curved lip for perfect pouring with literally zero drips; (3) it is marked in many different units such as cups, ounces, ml, etc.; (4) it is very light in weight yet unbreakable; (5) it feels really good in your hand.It also has disadvantages: (1) it's not a good choice for hot liquids because it's plastic (I use Pyrex for that); (2) the wonderful big foot tends to be full of water when emptying the dishwasher. I solved #2 in 10 seconds by drilling a teensy hole near the top of the foot, so water drains out of it when inverted in the dishwasher.If you are a serious cook and you buy this item and don't use it often, I'll be surprised."
4,good but light,"This would be better if it was made out of a better material. It is made out of really thin plastic. It doesn't seem like it would take much to break it. The lip doesn't act like a spout. It really could use a real spout. I find the plastic lid to be useless and easy to get lost. Other than that it is pretty cool. Getting used to it is tricky but it makes things easy. For example, if you are makeing a merinade using a recipe that calls for 1 cup of soy sauce and two tablespoons sugar, just fill it with soy sauce to the mark rotate the cup so you can see the tablespoon mark and add two tablespoons of sugar. This beaker would trully be a perfect beaker if it was made of heat resistant glass, had non hollow(solid) base, and came in a four cup size. Two cups is fine for most measuring utensils, but when you have a beaker like this one you can start making you sauce/marinade etc.. right in it because it can measure everything."
1,Plastic Number 7,This is made of #7 Polycarbonate and may contain bisphenol-A a hormone disruptor. This chemical can leach out when it is heated or exposed to acidic solutions.
2,Cracks,"I've had mine for quite a while so I'll probably still get another one. It's not like it cracked quickly, but it's leaking now & I'm a bit disappointed. I'd like to echo the other reviewer about the base making it hard to clean in the dishwasher. The scale gimmick is nice but it's hardly the perfect beaker. If it were more durable, had a solid (heavier!) base & a spout it would be perfect."
5,You need this!,"If you're like me, and need to use alot of measuring implements, then this is the one for you. I cook alot and constantly needed to search for measuring cups, spoons, etc.I saw this originally on ""Good Eats"" with Alton Brown, and knew I had to have it.. I love it!!! I love it so much I bought 2!The cover is great, too. It keeps everything fresh and in one place until you need it."
4,Inexpensive Measuring Cup,"I have two of these, one for measuring pesticides in the garage and one for measuring food in my kitchen. It's reasonably rugged, but it will develop cracks from cleaning in the dishwasher. Some gas additives will melt the plastic. Overall, a good deal for the money."
2,Not So Perfect Beaker,"I used to have one of these, until the flimsy plastic split down the side. It would be nearly perfect if it were made of Pyrex."
4,nice little measuring widget,"saw this used by my culinary hero, Alton Brown of Good Eats. it's got a nice, useful grading on it, a nice top, and things poor from it without making a mess."
4,Handy Kitchen Measuring Cup...,The fact that this beaker has so many different measuring scales makes it one of the most useful measuring cups in my cabinet. The curved lip pours without any drips. The one thing I dislike about it is that the base fills with water in the dishwasher. Surely they could have altered the design to keep that from happening.
3,Useful but has design flaws,"I use one of these regularly and for measuring it's hard to beat. My two complaints are the material (the plastic develops cracks and will eventually break) and the structure of the base (the base is a big cup, making this impossible to clean in the dishwasher).I want one similar to this, but with a base like a footed pilsner glass."
2,too fragile for daily use.,At first this seams like a great measuring cup. It can measure in just about every measurement and is more accurate for small measurements. The dissadvantages however show up pretty quickly. It says dishwasher safe but the dishwasher will quickly scratch it and it will appear very cloudy. It is extremly light and you will drop it sometime as a result. This thing is more fragile than glass and the base especially can break rather easily as the quality of the plastic leaves something to be desired. There is not spout and pouring sucks. In reality if it wasn't made from cheap plastic this would be just about the best measuring glass possible.
3,great measure but I hate that it is plastic,Great product as other reviews say but I won't replce the three I have because they are not dishwasher safe plastic. They crack after about six to eight months of use.Too bad
5,"Accurate, unlike Pyrex","I was a bit skeptical of the practicality of this. I've used the glass Pyrex measuring ""cups"" but I've found that they are not always so precise. Sometimes the measuring marks are even printed off kilter. This ""perfect beaker"" however is much more accurate and I've come to like it quite a bit. Because it is so narrow near the base, it is much more precise for measuring smaller amounts. I'm not really sure what the practicality of the lid is. I've never stored anything in this, only for measuring liquids. Also helpful is that there are multiple measurements, including cups, ounces, tablespoons, milliliters, et cetera."
3,"great idea, scratches too easily","This beaker is a wonderful tool for accurately measuring small quantities of liquid. The problem is that it scratches easily, so if you try to put more than one thing into it and then mix it will leave scratches that over time make the markings hard to read. Too bad they don't offer a version made of Pyrex."
1,Defective on the original and the replacement,It arrived for a Christmas present but the labels at the top showing the measurements were missing due to a printing error. I ordered a replacement and it was the same thing. Very disappointed.
1,"cracked in the first week, handwashing only, sad face","i like the design, however it cracked in the bottom in the first week of using it. and i don't have a dish washing machine either. i only hand wash. cheap product. it doesn't do me any good with a crack in the bottom."
2,"Perfect Design, Imperfect Measuring","I like the design of this measurer, but unfortunately the markings on mine are inaccurate. Compared to my other liquid measuring cups, the Perfect Beaker is off by a teaspoon at the 1/4-cup mark, off by two teaspoons at the 1-cup mark, and right on at the 2-cup mark. This is pretty bad compared to other measurers I've owned in the past. If you buy one of these, compare it against your other measuring cups before you use it."
1,"Works well, but doesn't last.","As a measuring cup, the beaker worked very well. It's easy to read and is easy to use since it's not glass. Unfortunately, inside of six months of regular use, the plastic began to crack all around the beaker. I'm not sure if the issue was the dishwasher or the microwave or what, but I wouldn't buy one again."
3,Pkastic Measuring cup,"It is handy to have several types of measure-English and metric on one cup.Reading the measurements takes some getting used to. The biggest problem iswhen washed in a dishwasher the base fills with water too, spilling uponremoval. My husbsand drilled 4 1/8"" holes at an angle to allow water in thebase to drain away(don't puncture through to inside of cup when drilling).This should have been engineered into the product at manufacture."
5,This is all you need for measuring in the kitchen! Perfect!,"I had one of these before that my husband brought when we combined households. After several years of use and abuse, it finally cracked on the bottom and I had to replace it immediately. Our household can't function without it! It's all you need in one product. No hassles with multiple measuring cups and is easy to store and find in your cupboard!"
4,Works as expected,"I've only used it a few times, and it works as expected. I wish there was a glass version, though. I don't like how plastic tends to get scratched. I haven't tried the lid yet, so I can't say how well it works."
5,Love it!,I just purchased a 2nd beaker for my mother's birthday. It's become one of the most useful things in our kitchen. Alton's book -- where we found it -- is also great.
3,Lid compromised by dishwasher,"Lid is not dishwasher safe, as the ad states. First time in the dishwasher, upper rack, the lid warped. Using a hand-held blender caused the liquid to splash out of the beaker. I returned it."
2,Not as perfect as it claims,"One of the best parts about this (and actually draws some fire from other reviewers) is that it's plastic, which means no meniscus when measuring water. It's actually easier than a glass measure because of that.There is, unfortunately, a downside. It doesn't matter how easy it is to measure when it's not accurate. Because it IS so inaccurate, this piece is almost worthless for being more than a decoration.It's a 6-star concept. With so many possible ways to measure this thing could have been awesome, but the practical realization falls far short."
1,Babies are not amused by Symphonic Stacker,"I purchased a Symphonic Stacker for my granddaughter, 3 years ago, when she was 1 year old. She did not pay any attention to it, and was not interested in stacking the disks, nor did she care if I stacked them. Her disinterest persisted - she is now 4 years old, and has never actually ""played"" with the toy. Her new little sister is 1 year old now, and she also ignores the Symphonic Stacker. It looks cute to grandmas, but has no appeal to little girls."
3,Good but no ladybug...,"I just bought this set from Target store for the same price as here. My almost 2 year old twins like it okay, however, they fight for the drum sticks. I was disappointed that my set did not have a ladybug xylophone in it, even though it was sealed. I like the set, but it seem a bit overpriced for what you get..."
2,Picture Misleading Buyer Beware,"Buyer beware ....... the picture is misleading. The ""Ladybug Xylophone"" is no longer included in this set."
4,Nice music set,"This is a great starter set to introduce children to musical instruments. The pieces are all colorful, easy to hold and fun to play with. My daughter loves to beat on the drum and enjoys shaking the other instruments to make noise. Other children that come to our house also enjoy this toy. This is a great introduction to music, but I think the Melissa & Doug music sets will suit older children better."
2,Nice Colors / Nice Shape / Bad Drum / No ladybug,"This toy looks very nice with the colors, shape and overall is durable. However, the main item of this toy, the drum, is very disappointing in sound and quality. Bought it for my 1y 2m boy and didn't get much of his attraction. There is no ladybug. All items produce rattling sounds !!"
2,not very musical,"This is an overpriced toy that is a disappointment if you are looking for something musical. The ladybug xylophne makes terrible tones. The drum is just plastic. You could make the same noise with a plastic bowl. The tambourine is ok. The bells don't have many bells on them. The clacker on the maraca doesn't work nd the maraca itself doesn't shake like a regular maraca. It is more like aplastic rain stick. I recommend getting $1.00 baby sized Maracas somewhere else. Overall, a huge disappointment."
5,"Love the ""Band""",We have purchased this set many times as gifts. It is durable and kids seem to gravitate the instruments. My son loves it and has played with it for years - and he is only 4.
4,Change is not always good,Love the toy but there is no lady bug. The price is the same for less product.I have purchased this for many children and recommended it to many grandparents and parents as a great gift in the past not so sure now. It is a great toy but the lady bug should come back
3,Interesting,"This movie is one that you have to be clear on your concepts of humor, history and race to view. It is a product of a time. The writing of the radio show on which it is predicated and the television show for which it was a foundation is more than interesting. Just watching and listening to the antics was a double edged sword. The humor is clever and can be demeaning. You can laugh at the fun it makes and cry for the misconcepts it presents. I found myself feeling sorry not just for the people that it uses to make fun of but for the way of thinking about a people. I am glad that I had a chance to see it so that my resolve about the reality of life and this country's attempt at humor can be placed in my awareness that suffering can take all forms. I old enough to have listened to the radio show, enjoyed the television show and understand that we all have to crawl before we can walk and then walk before we crawl again."
2,Not too funny Amos & Andy Film,"Racial issues aside, this 1930 film featuring radio's Amos &Andy (not to be confused with the Black actors who later appeared on television's version) in Blackface was so bad that even Freeman Godsen and Charles Correll who starred in the film hated it. While G&c are fairly convincing as Black men (except for the haunted house scenes when their blue eyes stand out), the dialougue, story, and action are all woefully unfunny. The ""mulsifyin' and revidin"" routine is fairly amusing and Duke Ellington's band briefly lightens the load, but other than that, G&C wisely chose to stay on the radio."
5,priceless treasure,"much like most early cinema society is too dumb to realize the world has changed along with values, i remember getting complaints for customers when i worked at the lowly hollywood video because the films i shows were not in color or were dated, well anyway amos and andy are a historic milestone in cinema and should be appreciated if there were no amos and andy there certainly would be no honeymooners or flintstones or something that joe suburbia would know (sadly)the simpsons. and there is a great performance by the duke (ellington) dont judge unless you have seen the film pc nazi's"
3,Issues of Political Correctness Aside,"Okay, everybody who has any interest in A&A knows about it being started by two White men (Gosden and Correll) in Blackface and later hiring real Black actos for the 12950s TV show. With that said, on to the movie itself.Simply put, it's not that good by any standards. There are a few midly amusing minutes of A&A doing some of their standard schtick such as ""Mulsifyin and Revidin"" and ""Phone Call to Ruby"" (as well as the tire changing routine that would later appear on the TV show). But aisde from this and the priceless footage of the Duke Ellington Band, FORGET IT! This early sound film is as dry as toast! A draggy love story not involving the prinicipal characters also helps slow things down like molasses in January. This film was so bad that even Gosden and Correll themselves have gone on record as dismissing it as junk and Charles Correll's son has recently said that his father hated it so much that he forbade his son from watching it! He had a smart daddy."
4,old skool movie buff,"I didn't order the movie for myself, but for a friend and he was happy to have found it. no complaints here"
4,Catfish of the World in one book,"This book contains almost all families of ""cats"" including Asian, African, European and North and (of course) South American. There were equal pages\pictures devoted to all species not just the most popular ""cory"" catfish. There are a lot of full color pics for id but most pics are not fully identified (i.e. synodontus sp.). There is also text on keeping the different families of fish including pH, temp, hardness etc.. Overall this is one of the most complete catfish books on the market although it could use some revision and additional info, but I still concider it in the top 5% of all fish books I have read."
3,Quality construction but less effective than cheaper antennas,"The antenna is very well made of quality components. It is simple to install and can be mounted either vertically or horizontally (I got better reception horizontally). I purchased it to bring in a station about 25 miles away as the crow flies, through the rolling hills of the Oregon Coast Range. I cannot get the station at all with an indoor antenna; I can get it with hiss and this $49 outdoor antenna mounted about 15 feet above ground. I can get the station without hiss using the Antennacraft FMSS Omnidirectional FM Antenna also sold by Amazon for less than $20. The Antennacraft antenna has about 6 times the length and even more area of metal to collect the signal, and it shows.Antennacraft FMSS FM Omni-Directional Antenna HD-Ready - 88-108MHz 30 Mile Range (1 Each)"
2,Two Good Songs,"I have been listening to country music for probably 8 or 9 years, ever since I was really little and listening to Crystal Gayle. So i'm not just typing nonsense. This CD is not like any other Jo Dee Messina's songs and past albums, the songs have no tune or melody instead she just hollars, She is not a bad singer, and a REALLY good performer. Just these songs have no country swing. The only two good songs on the CD areDelicious Surpriseand My Give a Damn's BustedOf corse this is0 only my opinion, and I don't think it was a good bye, and wish I knew how the music was before I bought it."
3,"interesting, but not great","I find it interesting that as Jo Dee is working on writing, she names this album after a cover on the album. While she gets points for choosing Beth Hart's work to record, she totally misses the mark performing it. Listen to Beth's version sometime and you'll see Jo Dee sounds bored by comparison!I used to try to be a fan of Ms. Messina, but something just always felt off to me. Still does. At least she is adamantly pursuing her dream."
2,Eh... It's Alright...,The only songs I like on this album are My Give A Damn's Busted and You Were Just Here... I don't know what it is but something is just missing from this album... Not putting JoDee down I have always been a fan... This album just doesn't do it for me.. Much better albums are I'm Alright and Burn...
5,Go Jo Dee!!!!!!!,"I have always liked Jo Dee Messina songs, but when I first heard ""My Give A Damn's Busted,"" I knew I would HAVE to have this CD! I bought it first thing Tuesday morning when it became available, and I love EVERY SONG on it! This woman can SING!I highly recommend it!"
5,OMG,Well what can I Nancylee say but Jo Dee is one of Country Music greatest people and this C D i found was great so go out and get your copy I got 3Nancylee
3,I DON GETTIT JO DEE,"Why does Jo Dee Messina, ""country's queen of hope and empowerment,"" look like a porn star waiting for the money shot on the cover of this album? Is this what the not-so-subtle album title, ""delicious surprise"" - printed on candy heart suggestively placed in her mouth - alludes to? I must be out of touch - I had no idea this is how Country albums were being marketed these days...."
5,Well worth the wait !!,"What a great CD. It finds Jo Dee in TOP form. Her vocals are great. The songs are of varying tempo and content.....makes it hard to decide if Jo Dee's ballads, or ""rockers"" are more her forte....she does both so well. The ballads are reminiscent of those on Burn....the uptempo remind me more of the older Jo Dee stuff.A great addition to your Jo Dee selection. Well worth the wait!"
3,Heaven was needing a Hero,"I bought this CD because reserach indicated that HEAVEN WAS NEEDING A HERO was on it and I wanted it for a funeral. This song is NOT on this CD... Does anyone know where I can find it. At this point, I'd pay album price for the song, or even import price."
1,Love Top Design - HATE Vid Quality on Season 1,"The video quality is quite poor on this season. Someone did not encode this properly for digital playback. The picture becomes fragmented and filled with lines when the motion is fast on the screen. Google Deinterlacing if you want to know more. I bought the first season for on demand viewing, and returned it because it was so distracting.Good news is that season 2 is encoded correctly, and plays beautifully. If they would re-encode season 1 I would buy it again... hint hint, Amazon."
2,I wish this was better.,"I love the concept of this show, and it should have been better. But the first episode, with Alexis Arquette as the ""celebrity"" client set a very awkward tone, and it does not get much better than that. I love decorating, and I love competition shows, so this is disappointing for me. HGTV Next Design Star does it better."
5,For The Love of Goldens,"I felt so honored when asked to provide my Golden story for this book, and when it arrived I let it sit for a few days. I was worried that some of the stories would be sad and open old wounds for me. One day I sat down and read it cover to cover and am a better person for doing so. Author Margo gently nudged each and every one of her authors to speak from their hearts in their own voices and each tale is utterly unique and beautiful. This book pays a fitting homage to the most loving and companionable breed of all time, the Golden Retriever. It is a wonderful testimony to what adopting a rescued Golden can do to enrich the lives of the adopter and adoptee."
3,Confusing,I read the whole book but found it confusing at many points in the book. There were so many characters and mixed up the plot.
3,would make a good computer game plot,"As I was reading this book, I kept thinking the story should have been made into a computer game, like a hidden object/puzzle/adventure game, instead of a novel. I play those kinds of games from time to time and I don't expect their plots to be intricate or believable. I do, however, expect more from a novel, and this book did not deliver. I got bored and never finished it."
1,This Pseudo-Documentary Deals in Proven Falsehoods,"The subject of this ""documentary,"" Bjrn Lomborg, controlled the final cut of this film. Since when does a legitimate documentary allow its subject to determine what does and does not go into the film? If you want proof, check out my story about meeting Lomborg and the film's director at [...] . The piece also contains links to a site that documents numerous factual errors and instances of plagiarism in Lomborg's film and books."
1,Biased movie,"This is completely biased and based on comments from authors not scientists about MAN MADE GLOBAL WARMING. This is the best example on how Oil and Gas companies see the real problem, but this film can't change the science or what's happening. We already started seeing its effects but we will keep debating until we come to point where we can not reverse (irreversible chain reaction)."
4,Above average,I really enjoyed using this product especially becauseof it's natural qualities. It felt really good on my skinand didn't have that oily feeling I expected it to have.A+ productRoselyn Marino
1,Not Good,I bought this product and to be honest it never work one day apparantly it has a manufacter defect but i guess that what you get for looking at low end product
3,More useful than I thought,This book turned out to be one of the volumes that I kept coming back to. It turned out to be very useful as a reference.
4,Works as advertised,I purchased this item and promptly used it to form a loaf of bread which I baked. It worked well as advertised and I am pleased with the purchase.
1,Frieling Round Brotform,This item is way overpriced. There are many baskets available at a far less price. This is a do not buy.
1,Pretty sure this is a cheap knockoff - super disappointed,"Received my brotform today after a ridiculously long wait (close to three weeks!). It is full of cracks and splinters. I'm afraid to use it because I fear getting splinters embedded in my dough. I recommend that you avoid this product despite the attractive price. I suppose I can use this as a storage basket so it's not a total loss, but, man, what a disappointment. Wish I'd taken more care to read all the reviews before I ordered as I see others have had a similar experience."
3,Quality is not there for the price,"My husband is bread baker and I purchased the round Brotform for him. Advertised as ""Ideal for baking European-style hearth breads""Unless you click the discrete link ""Read all product information"" they don't tell you it was made in China and until it arrives you won't see the lack of quality.I thought I was buying an authentic Banneton, not a poorly crafted (over priced) imitation."
3,"good item, but way overpriced","It works well enough, just like any basic brotform you can find online. I would suggest googling for better prices though because thirty dollars is WAY too much to pay for one of these. I don't think Amazon would let me post links or names to other sites instead (they take them out and leave a [...] in its place), but googling for brotforms and ""bread proofing bowls"" is easy enough.Update 4/17/2012: I was flipping through my product reviews trying to find one and I noticed this one. In the original review I said the price was way too high--it looks like Amazon lowered the price to $13.50 from $30 so that's good!"
4,Chris Youlden,"I think Chris Youlden is one of the best, if not the best blues singer, I've ever heard. At least he's my favorite. I search for anything he's involved with. I tried to get this cd for years and was finally able to get it. Although he is only on the 1st and last track. I had never heard Mick ""Wildman"" Pini before and, after hearing how good he was, I was surprized I hadn't. The cd is great. I do have to say though, hearing Chris again, in another band, makes me want a reunion with Savoy Brown (Kim Simmonds)and him. Are Tone Stevens and Roger Earl still out there? Sadly Lonesome Dave isn't."
3,"3 1/2 Starts for effort, but Dntel hasn't hit the high note.","I pre-ordered this album after listening to the ""Dumb Luck"" track. Thinking that the pure beauty of his voice and music was going to be throughout the album was abruptly interrupted by various artists that through me off from what I thought would have been a great album. In Dntel's first album ""Life is Full of Possibilities"", it was lacking vocal and direction, making that album sound mostly like background noise and incomplete tracks.Now with the album, Dntel has invited various artists to join in this album which in my opinion kills this album and Dntels true image. Songs like ""Roll on"" shocked me to listen to since I don't see how a ""country"" sounded song fits in with Dntels image.Personally, I found some songs enjoyable, but for the most part, Dntel needs to be SOLO with his work, including vocals. Dntel fans, listen the album first before"
5,Now THIS is great jazz music!,"This CD is one of the few jazz CDs I really enjoy. It is a work of art. The musician, Alan Joseph is really talented. I recommend this!!"
4,Crosby's redemption songs: I Love it !,"It's so good to hear cleaver redemption songs. After Ten years out of control, lost in space, it's a new mature survivor Crosby. And he still knows how to do it with such classic songs as Tracks in the Dust, Oh yes I can and the great oppener : Drive my car (not the Beatles one).Not to be missed if you love David Crosby !"
2,Buyer Be Aware,"This DVD was alright, nothing exciting. Chris Thomas does great impressions. T ""To The Mother@#*!in'K"" Kirkland is still telling his same style of jokes that he was saying on early episodes of Def Comedy Jam. It was cool seeing David Alan Grier doing stand up. You may enjoy this DVD. Definately get the 3rd installment of this series."
4,Functionality Plus!,"It took me 2 times to get the hang of this and it worked quite well for me. Keep it in the sink so water stays where it belongs. My greens were ""cleaned"" in no time. Very efficient."
3,Not for counter-tops,"CAUTION: This salad spinner/washer HAS to be used either in the sink, or, with a drip pan beneath it. There are little holes all around the base of the bowl holding the basket, so the water can run freely out. There is no way to stop the water running out. So, if you, like I, prefer to spin the salad on the counter top -- this isn't the salad spinner for you.NOTE: Try the OXO. I bought the OXO when I discovered that the EMSA one had the holes in the bowl. Now, I have a wonderful SALAD WASHER (EMSA) and a superb SALAD SPINNER (OXO)."
1,Problems,The sole on one shoe has delaminated twice since purchased. I was surprised since I had purchased this item before. Very disappointed.
3,Sizing on the small side,"I wear a size 9D (US) and my order was very tight on my feet. You should consider ordering a larger size than you wear. The break-in was not that bad though. The stitching, sole and quality of the leather looks great, the polish - not so much. There were several cosmetic flaws on the pair I received (which I polished out.)For those on your feet all day like I am, I would suggest someDr. Scholl's Tri-Comfort Orthotics Inserts, Men's Size 8-12, 1-Pair Packages (Pack of 3)as these shoes are not good for (at least my) extended wear.All in all a nice shoe. I've always liked the Florsheim brand."
2,Hmm...,I am fairly disappointed in this purchase. The pen does not write well. The cartridge is easily clogged and the balance in my hand is odd. Would not recommend.
4,Baby on the Way Book,"I absolutely loved this book for our 3 year old daughter! My 18 month old son wasnt too interested in it, its for a little older age but it was wonderful for my daughter, she loved it and was very interested in learning about the baby in mommys belly. I would recommend it to anyone with a 2 year old or older."
3,Not as AP friendly as I hoped,"Seems like a fine book, but not the one for me. I bought this hoping for a book for my son that reflected our family style, (family bed, home birth). I was disappointed that in it the family is preparing a nursery for the baby and it spends several pages discussing the mom and dad leaving the house to go the birth center/hospital to have the baby. Obviously all fine things, but not the things that I was hoping the book would help explain. I found the book spent way too much time talking about how mom was feeling, with only a very brief page showing a picture of the baby in the tummy. For me the only redeeming factor was the mother nursing the baby."
5,Class shows,"Frances Hesslebein is one of the world's greatest leaders. In fact, Peter Drucker (no ""easy grader"") said that she was the most effective executive that he had ever met._Hesselbein on Leadership_ is a compilation of her wonderful essays (largely from the journal ""Leader to Leader"").In a world where many leaders have gone for the ""quick buck"", it is gratifying to hear from someone who is interested in ""doing what is right"".Her writing, like her leadership, is direct, honest and to the point. Unlike some leaders who specialize in slogans, she is someone who only writes about what she believes in and is willing to live.Her work has the unique quality of being both timeless and refreshing."
4,Fun for the whole family,Fun game that can help to include more than one person when extra sets of drums are purchased
5,Bon Jovi New Jersey Videos,Another must have for jovi fans. Extremely enjoyable to watch. Brings back great memories.videos included:Bad Medicine (1st version-original video release)Born To Be My BabyI'll Be There For YouLay Your Hands On MeLiving In SinBlood On Blood (live footage)Bad Medicine (2nd version-excerpts from concerts)There are short interview/commentary/joking around by the guys inbetween the videos. This is a lot of fun for any true jovi fan.
5,Bon Jovi New Jersey VHS,"What a keepsake. It was interesting to see Jon and the group as ""youngsters"". I really enjoyed their early songs."
1,If you don't know the information in this book... how are you alive?,"I got this book from Mens Health. They sold me over the phone on a book that brings together all of the most recent facts about mens health, how to eat, how to stay in shape, etc.. What I got was a book about the most basic information that you could find just about anywhere. It was almost like they copied and pasted from Web MD. The nutrition information is outdated and extremely basic and the work out tips are about as basic as High School gym class. I rarely give things a bad review but this book was so disappointing, I ended up sending it back. I am almost embarrassed that my favorite magazine ""Men's Health"" would back a book like this.Granted I am someone that stays in shape and knows how to eat so I am sure this book can be helpful to some people. But there are much better books that are much more specific about what should or should not be done to stay healthy."
3,Small-format and brief,"Fine as a token gift, but will likely disappoint serious single-malt enthusiasts. Although the content covers many distilleries, only a paragraph of history is given on each one. The very brief tasting notes reflect only the ""house style"" rather than individual bottlings.Perhaps useful as a high-level survey of the differences between well-known malts."
5,Fabulous!,A one of a kind stand-up/rant that alternates between being very funny and very moving. After watching it (twice) I bought copies for 2 friends.
4,"Cute, but not as many diamonds as it appears in the picture.","I purchased this for my mother-in-laws birthday. It is very cute but the only thing that I was disappointed with is that the picture makes it look like the entire middle has diamonds in it, but there are only a few held in by either white gold or maybe silver."
1,Just a question,"I have been wondering about this tool: if you raise the bread in this basket, how do you remove it to ""pop it on the oven"" without making it fall? It simply won't work. It must be cooked in the raising pan."
3,not as good as I hoped,"Basket works well,but I do not like that the bottom of the basket does not have an oval design. I wish this would have been shown in the pictures. The pattern is simply straight lines which I do not find as attractive on the bread. I find that I use this basket more as a basket to serve the bread rather than bake it. I much prefer the round basket for baking."
4,Getting the loaf to the oven,"Transfer the risen loaf directly from the Frieling basket form to the oven stone (or to an oven peel if you are baking in a brick bread oven.) If you don't let the loaf rise more than it is supposed to it will not collapse when you do this transfer it. It is also customary to then slash the now floured and coiled top of the loaf with a very sharp razor blade (or french lame) 1/2"" deep to allow for a spring of the loaf in the oven. Again, if you let the loaf rise until a thumb print remains in the dough it is past the point it should be.I don't use any water on these baskets. After the basket has air dried, just brush the flour out of the groves with a vegtable cleaning brush to keep the deeply coiled look to a loaf. Dust with flour before using it again."
1,Terrible company,"Purchase this item in 08 for use for my young daughter. We used it in the summer and it was stored indoors when not used which was not often. This tube was not abused and was used only with the young kids. The tube deflated after less than 2 years (weekend summer use only) and I looked to see that it had come apart at the seem. I emailed the company, twice and called them to see if I could get a replacement tube or to purchase a repair kit. I was never contacted. I understand that there is only a year warranty but this was quite a disappointment as we did not cause the problem...it was a defect. RAVE SPORTS has Very poor customer service...I email back would have been nice as I needed to purchase another tube and went with another company. Bryan Outboard, Inc through Amazon is great...we bought the BIG MABLE from them and it arrived in 3 days and their customer service is great as well as being the best price."
1,Stopped Working in a month,"I loved this for the month it worked. Then it wouldn't boot up past the PEARL screen. Now I just have a $40.00 Flash storage device, because it will still allow storage on it."
2,RCA Th101 Pearl Series not what I expected,"I was a little disappointed in the RCA Th101 Pearl. First of all, what I was looking for in a mp3 player was (1) a player the ran on a AAA battery and (2) one that has a micro sd card slot. I thought that this player would be the ideal. However, when I tryed to play the sd card, it crapped out. I found out through numerous experiments that is only plays a 1 gb sd card. The 4, 8 and 16 gb cards did not play. So this essentially makes this player a 2 gb player. The other thing that I found annoying was the controls on the player. I was hard to figure out (I bought a used player and didn't have a user guide). It was cumbersome to use. All in all, I wouldn't recomment it."
1,WARNING: The external micro-sd is limited to 512 megabytes!,"Just heads-up: I bought one of these elsewhere and returned it because the TH1101 refuses to recognize an external MicroSD card if it contains more than 512 MB of mp3's. Also, the audio level is low enough that I could barely hear the music at all in a busy office. You can turn it up higher but then the audio drops out on musical peaks. A $10 set of more-sensitive ear buds should fix that. Regular headphones require more power than ear buds for a given music level so this probably isn't a good mp3 player to use with headphones."
3,If only . . .,"If only you could easily switch from grams to ouncesI loved the look and the capabilities (easy to read, accurate and large measurement range) but when it came down to it my husband hated note being able to switch from grams to ounces easily. We must measure the coffee beans in grams! It had to go back. We have a Salter now. It isn't as cool looking but it does the job."
3,If only . . .,"If only you could easily switch from grams to ouncesI loved the look and the capabilities (easy to read, accurate and large measurement range) but when it came down to it my husband hated not being able to switch from grams to ounces easily. We must measure the coffee beans in grams! It had to go back. We have a Salter now. It isn't as cool looking but it does the job."
3,Incorrect packaging,"I ordered two Eternity Moment Body Lotions as a gift for my Mother, when I received the package both of the outside packaging stated Body Lotion, however upon opening each package I discovered only one Body Lotion and one Body Wash. I was disappointed because my Mother has a difficult time finding this lotion and I was trying to stock her for a month or two with 2 lotions. I didn't return as it would cost too much money and hassle."
4,Part three equal to the tale,"I read Gorky Park a long time ago but started in on polar star and now red square. Well written, just a great character in Renko. Only wish I had reread Gorky Park prior. A friend said I didn't need to, but you really do, especially to fully understand Red Square."
3,Jumpy transitions,"It was an okay read for me. I really didn't like its jumpy transistions. I found myself lost, many times, when the book had flash backs or locational jumps. Just not enough to rave about..."
5,Martin Cruz Smith Did It Again!,"All I have to say is if you are thinking of buying this book, do it. If you have not read Gorky Park or Polar Star first, then I strongly suggest you do so. The excellent aspect, I believe, of this book is its connection with the past two. While I enjoyed Gorky Park, Polar Star is where I fell in love with reading about Renko. By the time I read through Red Square, I came immediately online to see if there is another Renko novel to read. There is, Havana Bay, thank goodness, I don't know what I would have done if there wasn't. This is the perfect series of books to read, for anyone who does not mind a little challenge. Enjoy!"
4,Outstanding writing and sense of place,"I read this right after reading An Agent In Place by Robert Littell, who's supposedly equally versed in all things Russian. I'm sorry but Smith blows Littell away in terms of writing talent, evocative descriptions, and intricate plotting. Smith successfully captures the chaos of the days after the '91 coup in Moscow, as well as how Party stalwarts morphed overnight into rapacious capitalists."
5,a gripping portrait of the new Russia,"If you're reading this review it's probably because youhaven't read Martin Cruz Smith's Red Square yet. And that'stoo bad, because you're missing a vivid glimpse into both themafia-riddled new Russia and the loyalties of the human heart.Arkady Renko, the homicide detective hero of Smith's earlierbooks Gorky Park and Polar Star, returns to Moscow and findshimself battling an international crime ring in a story thatcrosses the German border and brings him face-to-face withhis longed-for lost love. The gripping plot and Smith'smasterful ability to capture the nuances of these complexgeographical and psychological landscapes make this a bookyou will remember every time you pick up a copy of yourfavorite news magazine."
2,Meandering and Disjointed,"I really tried to get into this book, but ""Red Square"" did not satisfy. The characters were not memorable and were basically rehashed versions that Cruz Smith has used before. The whole plot was confusing, and there appeared to be several plot holes or situations that didn't really make sense so that by the end the resolution left me feeling very unsatisfied. Certain scenes were also rehashed from earlier books, such as the scene in the sauna/ bath house, and came across as very repetitive and unimaginative. The romance with Irina was very sappy; I mean, the two haven't seen in each other for years, she treats him coldly, and then a few days later (while he's bleeding from a near-death experience) they have sex and decide to stay together? While it was interesting to read about the fall of the Soviet Union, the book did nothing for me. ""Gorky Park"" was far better, in my opinion, and it seems the series is just getting worse and worse."
5,A great book with a great ending,"This book is not only a terrific action/mystery novel that is beautifully written, it provides significant insights into the transition of Russia from a communist to a capitalist state.And it makes a very significant statement about how the Russians feel about the new Russia. After hundreds of pages of predominantly negative portrayals of the problems of new Russia, you get a very poignant portrayal of how much the people of Russia want to defend that society."
3,Firehouse,"It was a pretty interesting read. Just jumped around a little too much, but all in all liked it."
2,Interesting,The history about the firehall really helps you appreciate the dramatic events that unfolded for the firefighters.It is hard to put yourself in their shoes.Recommend
4,You know the ending,"You start reading and already know how it ends (9/11/2001) and which firefighters lost their lives. Cannot put this book down. Heartfelt look into the everyday lives of our everyday Heroes, firefightersB Smith Volunteer Firefighter"
3,Firehouse Review,"While I enjoyed reading the book at the time I must admit it left no real lasting impression on me.As a firefighter myself I appreciated the way the microcosm of firehouse life was explained and could identify with the NYFD personnel.Just didn't feel like I had a greater insight to the calamity that befell the NYFD and this firehouse after reading this book than I did before.A book called ""Red Watch"" about the London Fire Brigade which is also about the loss of firefighters I found had much more depth to it."
1,Stay away from this mat!,"I bought this bath mat because it looked very useful. After having it though, I found that the top surface is very slippery (not what you want in a non-slip mat), and it mildews very quickly underneath.Buy this mat instead: Safety Bath Mat Large White by Bath Care (Amazon sells this, I just can't seem to put the link here.)"
4,Very good bath mat.,"Grips great. Large enough to cover most of the tub floor. Feels much safer than smaller, white bath mat. This mat's suction cups are much more gripping. Also, washes clean in the wash machine, unlike my previous white one which seemed to hang onto mold."
5,Fits the whole tub,This is a very large mat and fits the tub nicely. I like it because I can walk up and down the whole length of the shower and not worry about falling. It is soft under the feets and smooth enough to sit on for bathing. Suctions nicely to the tub and the clear blue looks great on our blue bath tub.
5,"Bravo, Dinosaurs","The imaginative story of Dinosaurs' bedtime rituals (neverbefore discovered), simultaneously introduces dinosaur names and theintricacies of poetry, backdropped by lullabies of soothing cadence.Entertaining for pre-schoolers to college professors, ""Good night, Dinosaurs"" is a unique celebration of language and rhythm, matched with delightful illustrations by Victoria Chess.This book has a wonderful complexity comprised of humorous couplets, alliteration and assonance, and changing patterns.The colorfully detailed and textured pictures depict the fanciful and comical images that create a superior children's book--a pleasure for both the child and the adult."
5,Great Compilation,"This album shows artists venturing into new ground for today's music. While ""Jupiter Jam"" wasn't exactly my cup of tea, all of the tracks are poignant and evocative."
3,"Ignore the subtitle (""Poems"")","Tarantula is in the stream-of-consciousness style of Dylan's liner notes to Highway 61 Revisited and Bringing It All Back Home. The publisher did our beloved author a great disservice in labeling these writings ""Poems."" These short pieces - interspersed with pseudo-missives - are literally unbridled prose, brimming with wit, sarcasm and absurdities. Only Dylan can say for sure what they're all about. A poet is not necessarily one who writes rhyming verse, but formlessness is not poetry either. To call Tarantula ""poetry"" is to turn a blind eye to Dylan's assault on traditional prose narrative forms. That said, I think Tarantula is a great book to have on the shelf, but it's not easy or especially rewarding reading unless one is primarily interested in the author. Because it's Dylan's only book (aside from published lyrics), it's a rather important book. Likewise, Dylan admirers should see D.A. Pennebaker's classic mid-60s Dylan documentary, ""Don't Look Back."""
3,Wild Mercury writing,"Dylan's ""book"" is some wonderful out there stuff. I think fans of anything goes literature will love the word play. Its like William S. Burroughs without the brilliance. I have a group of friends who love to try and write at this level of surrealism. One, Noah, just published a book of his own on Amazon and I think fans of Tarantula will enjoy it:Franklin's Tower"
4,Roller coaster Dylan,"Possibly throwing us for a loop, or possibly showing us a peek inside his genius mind, Bob Dylan's only novel is something to behold, that's for certain. A 'unique' type of prose, it's not so much a novel but just a mish-mash of thoughts that at the time Dylan probably giggled over while hunched over his typewriter. Or perhaps he took this seriously. We'll never know but we do have this book and it's worth a look for any Dylan fan. Just keep in mind, don't bother trying to 'follow along' with the story. Just enjoy the show and go with it."
2,"A few funny parts, but...","If you want to sample some Dylan ""prose poems"", save yourself some time and read the liner notes to Highway 61. Tarantula is those notes stretched out over 150 pages. It is conclusive proof that Dylan is a songwriter, not a poet."
2,The Dangers of Heroin,"Dylan is by far the greatest songwriter of all-time and perfectly deserving of a noble prize in literature if ever one is bestowed upon him. However this stream of consciousness book is pure crap. It will be a highly collectible book if you have the first edition, first printing in good conditon in about 50 years. Till then read Lyrics 1961-2001 or Chronicles vol.1 instead."
2,Do not be deceived by the name,"This machine does not make lattes or cappuccinos. When I ordered it I had no idea how to make a latte. The manual that comes with it does not tell how to make lattes, just how to froth milk. I had to buy an espresso machine to make my lattes. The froth milk spout(steamer) doesn't work all the time. Most of the time it doesn't produce froth, just warm milk....it is an excellent coffeemaker. The coffee is very hot and stays hot a long time in the carafe."
2,Does not make Latte!!,"This is a mediocre machine that makes steamed milk and coffee. However, it is advertised as a latte maker. It does not make latte's. Personally, I think it is false advertising.A Traditional ""Latte"" requires a shot of espresso and unless you have an espresso machine you can not make Latte's with this product. I had to purchase an additional espresso machine to make Latte's with this product.Buyer beware."
3,"Handy, but difficult","This book does give a good overview of hermeneutics. Although I found the book difficult to read, it is still worthwhile to use.The reason for difficulty is the fact that Schneiders uses a lot of repetition of words. What would have been handy in the book is to use schemes to prove or to justify statements as opposed to only text."
5,"Wonderful book, must have for poets, poetry readers","An invaluable aid to anyone interested in reading or writing poetry.Arranged alphabetically, as you would suspect, the book covers forms, poeticmovements, the elements of poetry, and rhetorical devices. My highestrecommendation. A continuing source of information and inspiration."
5,Hilarious!,"Really funny book, well worth the read. Gave this as a humorous gift to my eldest daughter who is a cat lover and she adored it."
5,A real wake me up!!,"This tea is a favorite of coffee lovers in this house, flavorful and full bodied. One problem is, you can't find it in the grocery stores, so I am SO glad that Amazon offers it to us. We buy the 6-pack and oftentimes give them to tea-loving friends who then go in search of it :)Good stuff!!"
3,Not so good,"This tea is made for coffee lovers according to people. I'm a coffee lover and I don't love this tea. People say it has a nutty flavor but I didn't taste any of that. It tastes like very strong green tea and it has the smell of it as well.The flavor comes out more when I add a lot of sugar to it. The flavor is tolerable to drink once in a while but it's not great.If you're looking for something that would last for a long time (because you won't be drinking this tea much and it's a pack of 6), get this tea."
5,Quite Simply an Essential!,"One of a few items in this world that I simply can't live without. Four cups of Morning Thunder gets me going for the rest of the day. I've convinced quite a few jaded coffee drinkers to switch over, and every time the feedback has been nothing but positive. I swear, if Celestial Seasonings ever discontinued Morning Thunder, I would probably be forced to take hostages."
5,Better than Coffee,"If you're out there looking for a tea that can rival coffee than this is for you. I like my black tea strong and hearty and this is my favorite. Just a wee bit stronger than Irish Breakfast IMO and with a great flavor. I am a bit picky when it comes to teas and coffees but had to give this one an A+++ for every catagory. You won't be disappointed. Also, you can actually find this on most grocery store shelves compared to some other brands and the price is compariable to others."
5,Some get up and go!,"I love Celestial Seasoning's Morning Thunder tea. I have recently stopped drinking coffee and had been on the search for a cup of tea that would give me a comparable kick and be delicious as well. I found it in Morning Thunder. The black tea is strong and is accented with the uniquely aromatic and delicious flavor of Yerba Mate, a traditional Brazilian beverage. I love it!"
5,If the Fall season had a taste...,This tea is my morning time savior. I'm not a coffee drinker. I've tried it and hate the jitters.My family has Cherokee Indian in our blood and this tea tastes like pow-wows smell. It's amazing. I have enjoyed it straight and with a little bit of milk & sugar.
5,Good Tea...,Its not always easy to find any Celestial Seasonings Black Tea in the local stores so when I found this on Amazon for less than I usually pay when I do find it I subscribed to a case of six every four months which works about right for me with a substantial savings. Its the closest tea to Fast Lane which you can only buy direct from Celestial Seasonings. I enjoy a cup or two almost every night.
3,Not the place to start,"This is definitely not the place to start if you're looking to ""try out"" or ""sample"" Happy's music.This was primarily intended to be (as stated in the liner notes on the album) a collection of Happy's quieter/softer tunes (not that she ever approaches head-banging...). Thus, it winds up as a wash of down-tempo, mostly acoustic songs/versions that can be quite, well, dull.This album is best for the Happy Rhodes fan that wants to get their hands on some of the otherwise unavailable or hard-to-find songs/versions on the CD...A better place to start for an intro to Happy's music would probably be The Keep (also a compilation album, but this time of all previously unreleased stuff... with more variety) or Warpaint (her 1st album, and still the best, IMHO)."
3,Happy Just to Be Here,"Happy Rhodes is something of a small cult phenom, and since I heard of her through the grapevine, I decided to try this compilation album. Happy has an amazing vocal range and a richly textured voice. However, Rhodesongs is a one-note album in the Kate-Bush-soaring-sappy-vocals vein. I think with more diverse material, Happy could be a truly compelling artist."
1,Do not buy this product,I also purchased a Samsung R-135 dvd recorder (thru Dell) and just after the 90 day warranty expired it started indiscriminately refusing to play dvds until it did not play any...I am considering sending it to the repair shop recommended by Samsung but since I only paid $140 for it and I would have to pay labor plus shipping I think that I will junk it and buy another one locally.
1,Stopped working after less than 10 months,"Have owned the smasung DVD RW 135 for less than 10 months. Started to get error messages that it could not read disc. Tried cleaning DVD and discs, which did not help. Problem contiuned to worsen and now it will not read any discs. Seems to be a common problem with this model. Would not recommend this model."
2,Was good for a while - horrible after a year,"Bought our DVD-R135 in July '06. Worked very well for about a year. It started not recognizing DVDs this summer (2007) and even after the cleaning disc was run through it, it stopped recognizing brand new DVDs. Have to turn off the unit multiple times and run the cleaning CD through 4 or 5 times to get anything disc to come up now. Going to the store today and definitely won't be buying a Samsung replacement model. Sadly it matched our Samsung TV and entertainment center :( The unit is in a very clean, well ventilated environment so dust and heat are not the cause. Seems like just poor workmanship."
4,Pretty Sweet,"I just ordered this recorder for my dad. From the outside, the box is handsome and feels sturdy. The play quality is beautiful, a noticable improvement from my parents' 2 year old progressive scan panasonic player. The remote is cool-looking, but the button layout could be better and there's no back-lighting. Recording is very simple and easy. There's no tv guide feature, but judging from the reviews that feature has been getting on other players, that's probably for the best. On picture quality alone, I think this machine is worth considering."
2,not too happy,"I bought a reconditioned machine 5 months ago and have had trouble with it recently jamming or going completely blank, sometimes during a DVD and sometimes when I tru it on. I end up having to shut off the TV and the DVD and have not yet figured out what is causing the problem. The picture is great and the controls are fairly intuitive. But for the unreliable nature of the one I bought, I would be happy."
1,"Terrible Audio Hissing - Save your time, stay clear!","Unfortionately I didn't read the reviews at Amazon, only circuit city. I hooked up every possible audio connection, and their is a loud hiss. When I switch back to another component the hiss is gone. Now after reading the other reviews, this sounds like a common problem. I am actually suprised that a company can even sell something like this.I never took the time to learn how to record shows, so I can't comment on that. The menu and set-up was very easy and the manual was well written."
1,Terrible. Save your money.,Realized that I had made a mistake when the unit would stop recognizing dvds right out of the box. Unit would sit and load for 30 seconds and then spit the disc out. Absolutely useless. I am so frustrated with this piece of junk.
1,Another unhappy customer,"I have to chime in with many of the other reviewers here and tell you this is not a product you want to own. To be fair, I will say that when it works, it works well -- the upconversion is great. But the key word is ""when."" The DVD recorder just stopped working, and while this is extremely frustrating, it is okay since I don't record a lot. However, a few months ago it just stopped reading DVDs -- and I just got this for Christmas '06! You have to power off several times, open and close the player several times, and sometimes it will finally read the DVD. I would toss it, but this thing cost $200! Be forewarned."
1,I would never purchase a Samsung Product Again,I purchased my Samsung DVD-R135 about 8 months ago and it has been going down hill since then. It will no longer play any DVD's except ones that are recorded on a computer. I contacted Samsung about the problem and was notified that I would have to pay a $64 shipping fee plus labor which would be more than the $99 I paid for the unit. I am going to trash this DVD play and get myself somthing else but definitely not a Samsung.
2,Good while it last.,It worked great for me for about 7 months. Great video quality for both DVD's and Divx files. Now it doesn't play any DVD any more. Has to ship it + $30 labor to fix it. But I think I'll just trash it though. This seems to be a problem for a lot of people.
4,"Good DVD player, but terrible remote control","I bot this DVD player/recorder to use with my 1080P Samsung HDTV. So far my only complaint is the remote control. It's small, the buttons are tiny, the buttons don't light up, and it doesn't have volume buttons. As far as I can tell thus far, there is no way to program the remote to operate the TV, even tho both are Samsung products. The remote for my TV works some of the functions of the DVD player, but does not work many of them. For example, it has a forward button for jumping ahead by several scenes, but it doesn't have a fast forward button. Thus, I have to have both remotes in hand, plus my DirecTV remote in hand, when I watch a DVD."
2,One Flaw Ruins the Whole Thing!,"I agree with another review. Hooked everything up, very excited to finally get one. Watching/recording TV, horrible buzzing noise in the audio stream! Tried connecting optical line and rca plugs to reciever, and rca plugs to the tv, no luck, buzzing persisted. Audio was fine for watching DVDs, buzzing showed up on recorded from television DVDs. Stopped for no reason once while playing a brand new movie. I'm taking this junk back to Circuit City tomorrow!"
1,Beware of this product,"The product worked ok for about 6 months, then became unable to load commercial DVDs. Save your money...manufacturer does not appear to make firmware to correct (although later models have firmware released for similarly described problems)."
1,An unfortunate purchase,So sorry I bought this. Can't recognize DVD's. Literally - it has never recognized a DVD. How do they get away with putting this on the market?
2,Not to buy it again,"I have bad experience with ""Samsung DVD-R135"". I just used it 4 times (recording) not playing - Now it is just a decoration."
1,I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT...EVER,"It doesn't even deserve a full star!!! Never buying a Samsung product after this piece of junk. Even after a trip back to Samsung for expensive repairs, it still fails to operate 95% of the time, often freezing up and locking discs inside. Has yet to record properly. Poor customer service, poor quality! Based on the number of similar reviews, they should really look into their quality control."
1,Why me?,"This unit has a mind of it's own. Example- I insert a dvd, and it freezes-TOTALLY. So I eject it (after it decides when it wants to eject) and put in another disc. This disc plays OK so I reinsert the original disc. Plays fine. Next time I try this procedure, you guessed it, same thing happens. I noticed that there are none for sale that are NEW. Thanks for your time."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I had this item for over a year and it stopped working as many have described in previous reviews.I had it repaired once-paying for labor, Samsung decided to cover the parts since so many bad units out there.Well, after four months it is having the same problems again that it did before repair-not able to read any DVD's, brand new commercial or recordable. I called Samsung and they offered to cover the parts again, but I would be stuck footing the bill for labor-that would mean in the end I would end up spending over $100 in repairs!Not to be fooled again by an obviously flawed product, I will take the money and invest in a unit by a different manufacturer, I highly recommend others do the same.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT-IT IS FLAWED"
1,Never again!,I'll never buy another Samsung DVD product again. Completely stopped working after a year and a half. Costs as much to repair as to get a new product (not a Samsung). Hope someone who works for Samsung reads these (yeah right).
3,This is NOT a toy!,"I purchased the Barbie doll as part of my Irish Barbie Doll series, so that I would have the complete series. I don't know how authentic the clothing is, nor do I care. She is a beautiful doll...but not purchased to be played with, only to be looked at and admired!"
1,I thought this was a JOKE!,"I flipped through this, as usual, the usual Bush platitude and down-home country good sense, Mom and Apple Pie.If there was ever a president who made me want to vomit more, it was before I was born."
4,good value.,Really sped up an old laptop. Easy to install with minimal tools and minimal knowledge. Good value for what it cost too.
5,New Ram,"Had a totally useless notebook given to me for parts (Toshibia L25-121) that was slow as dirt. Bought this RAM put it in turned on the computer and the BIOS located it right away and now this computer has a new life and is running smoth and faster than it has ever before. This RAM was really super cheap compared to Best Buy that wanted $40.00 a stick bought 2 for less then $26.00 here on Amazon and recived it in 3 days by mail, which I thought was really fast."
5,It works perfectly on my Gateway MX6447 Laptop,"This memory stick fits perfectly, and it is completely compatible with Gateway Laptops Model MX6447. Very easy to install as a replacement and/or upgrade to your laptop memory.Highly recommended for less than $15 with free shipping."
1,Listed as compatable......,"I bought this to increase the RAM in my old Toshiba Satelite L25 S121 - circa 2003 or so. I have had the following RAM since buying the unit: a 1G upgrade (bought after first getting the laptop) and the OEM 256K in it which gave a total of 1152KB. I replaced the old OEM 256 K with the new 1GB side by side with a previous 1 GB upgrade. Result - 856K total - less RAM! So I swapped all three around to see if one was a culprit. Both 1G units only gave 856K alone. The Kingston unit would not combine with the old 256K and both only gave 856K. In other words, there must be some kind of compatibilty issue with the Kingston unit working along side another chip in this particular Toshiba laptop. SO, back to the drawing board. If you have an old Toshiba L25, you probably won't get this RAM to work with another module."
5,MUST HAVE,"THIS BOOK IS THE ONLY BOOK(HOLLYWOOD NOW & THEN)THAT TELLS THE TRUE STORY OF HOLLYWOOD IN PHOTOGRAPHS,WITH MR. JOHNNY GRANT WRITING THE INTRO YOU CAN'T LOSEIT IS JUST A WONDERFUL BOOK!"
1,Must have book...if you're in need of a drink coaster,"Another piece of drivel from the crayons of George Ross Jezek. Don't let the lovely cover fool you, the interior contains nothing of value. Jezek's photos are incredibly poor and badly shot. Of course there's also the unappetizing prerequisite of factual errors which are far too common throughout Jezek's work. I'm surprised this stinkster even remembered to remove the cap when taking the pictures. This book was made for gullible tourists. If Amazon would allow to me to leave ""0"" stars for this book, it would still deserve a negative. If you're in the market for a suburb book on Hollywood, I suggest go out and buy Rosemary Lord's book. Jezek's book doesn't even have a discount, he's a greedy fella he is."
1,uch - no good,"i have a pretty good understanding of elec. music. i've been listening to the genre for nearly a decade... to say this is short of brilliant and a hopscotch away from tourettes would be an understatement. eight frozen tries to carry the chaotic rhythms of milanese with the saavy of skream, emphasis on tries... the only track worth listening to in this entire album would have to be 'the drills for devil dub'. simply because after you get done with the overindulgent beats 40 secs into the song he actually starts to use some of his technical skills to good use, it does carry some sort of direction. mind you he still finds the way to insert a couple unnecessary drills but what would an experimental song be without 'crazy'. you may think i'm over exaggerating, even cruel perhaps in my review but so was he in having me think this was music. i say save your time and money and look for something else..."
3,"Okay, Not the Best","Product works okay, have been happier with other exfoliating products I have used. Probably will go back to previous product."
4,Love,"Great exfoliator! This product can be used daily, but I just use it a couple of times a week for a great skin pick-me-up."
5,great exfoliating wash,"I love this productI have used it for a couple of years nowIt is very gentle but really exfoliatesIt leaves my skin so soft, this largecontainer is so great you can use itall over your body!"
2,Irritates skin,"Had high hopes, based on the reviews, but I guess it's ""each to his own"". Irritating to my skin, from the very first use and increasingly so over the course of two weeks. No longer use it."
5,Great product,Very nice alternating from Purity to this. I definitely feel the difference in how soft my skin is after using. Will continue to use this product.
4,Not too bad,"I like the philosophy product line, which is what made me buy this product from philosophy. I would say that It's an okay product when it comes to exfoliating. Neither I can say it's great nor I hate. It's not too bad."
4,"Good, but not really for every day","I'm always looking for the best exfoliating cleanser, so I figured I'd try the Philosophy product.First thing you notice is that it can come out sort of runny and thin...seems to be important to give it a good shake to mix things up. The fragrance is mild and barely noticeable. I like the beads - they're small, more like grains of fine sand than anything. It also rinses off cleanly without residue.Seems to work well...after a few days, your skin seems fresher and smoother, although in my case, also somewhat drier - switching to an every-other-day schedule solves that. Bottom line is that it seems about average for the better products. Worth a try, especially if you like Philosophy products generally."
2,made me break out!,"I use exfoliating face wash every day and I have never broke out before, I don't know what it is that is causing it but it IS BAD! I got zits all over my face, so I can't use it any longer, and I'm out 20 bux. Bummer."
2,Good face wash,I liked this product made my face feel clean but did not make my face feel soft. For the price I would not buy it again. The price was kinda high for face wash. Also I like a face wash that has alot of vitimans in it this product did not.
3,Don't use a pump,"Mine came with a pump, but the exfoliant clumps and all I get is a watery-substance when I pump into my hand. The product definitely exfoliates well, that's why it gets 3 stars, but because I have sensitive skin I tend to break out if I use more than two times a week (which is why it doesn't get 5 stars). The exfoliation is definitely ""micro"" so you're not getting a bunch of big beads drooping down your face, and instead it stays put while you're doing your exfoliation. Overall, as far as exfoliation goes, this does a great, great job, with my face feeling very smooth afterward. Just a word of caution for those with sensitive skin, don't over-do it, and for all users out there, avoid the pump."
5,Wonderful daily exfoliation!,"I use this product in the evening in the shower. It polishes my skin without scrubbing too hard and cleanses at the same time. Although this scrub does cleanse, it won't take off mascara and is a bit too rough on the delicate eye area. Some people may prefer to use it as their AM cleanser. Although the price seems high, it only takes a quarter-sized dollop to do my face, neck, chest, and shoulders; it's a good value because it goes a LONG way. MDW does have a fragrance, which isn't exactly pleasant or unpleasant, but the smell doesn't linger on the skin."
1,disappointed with product and bottle,"This was such a rip off product. After a couple of months of use, the exfoliating beads disappeared and it was just liquid. Now it's useless. The entire time I was using this, the pop up lid kept getting clogged and I had to unscrew the top to get the product out. Will not buy this again. Save your money and avoid frustration by finding another product."
5,Great cleanser!,"I've used this for a long time and have seen friends, husband, family start also after trying mine. Great price from this vendor. Delivery time was unbelievably quick. Would buy again and have told others about this."
1,I really wanted to like this product...,"After reading the rave reviews about this product not only on Amazon but also on Sephora, I was excited about buying this exfoliating wash. The product worked really well for a few months...This is why I was so disappointed when the exfoliating beads disappeared only within a few months! I have half the bottle left and all I have left is the cleanser. I am so disappointed that this happened after paying for the product. I don't know if mine was a dud, but be wary that you might end up with disappearing beads within a few months!"
5,amazing!,"I have sensitive, dry skin and always seem to have problems finding a good face wash. I need something that really scrubs without leaving me looking red and irritated and a wash that doesn't dry out my skin too much. I had tried many other products and given up on finding something that works. I read lots of reviews raving about the Hope in a Jar and decided to give it a try. I must say I am very pleased. I have been using this product for over a week and am amazed at how good my skin now looks. I started out only scrubbing for 30 seconds in the shower to test it. After one use I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt and how well it took the toner and moisturizer after (I am using Body Shop vitamin e toner and lotion). After a week my skin is much improved and my husband loves the way it feels so much that he even tried it. (I may have to hide it from him as I think he likes it too much!). I can't wait to try some of the other products in this line. Love it!"
3,"A mild exfoliator,more suitable for normal to dry skins","It does not live up to the name of ""home microdermabrasion""On similar term,Origins Modern Friction Nature's Gentle Dermabrasion Face Scrub is much better.For oily skins with blackheads or breakouts,i suggest Ionax scrub(Healthpoint).Trustworthy and affordable."
5,foot pillow,This pillow has made sleeping with a broken ankle so much more comfortable...had surgery and no cast so it has been a real joy.
4,"Happy Birthday, Rex","I am the fifth generation living on a piece of my great-great grandfather's farmland. There has been a tradition all those years to have an Australian shepherd named Rex living here. And so we do! He will be eight years old on March third, so hasn't yet eaten this tasty-looking and really clever gift. Therefore, I awarded four stars simply because this gift hasn't yet passed his taste test. However, it looks good enough for anyone to be tempted to take a bite. I consider this a great gift for any dog owner who loves to indulge his/her pet--as my husband does the ""king"" at our house."
3,"Easily Forgettable, But So What?","This is early Wodehouse that prefigures the later greats--the complicated plot and misunderstandings are all here, and while you don't get anything approaching Bertie's voice, you do get a fun couple of hours. Worth picking up if you see it for a buck or two. Good book for the train."
1,A horrendous book!,"I found this book to be an extremely dishonest portrayal of Israeli history. Let's stop making heroes out of these Zionist colonizers. The reader would do far better to read an honest work like ""The Holocaust Industry"" by Norman Finkelstein. As a Jew I'm offended by the whole rotten history of Zionist ideology. Our great religion calls for ""tikkun olam""--the healing of the world! This great compassionate and humanistic teaching is inherently contradictory with Zionism, which is pure and utter racism. Zionism is is also simply just a replay of European colonialism in a thinly veiled disguise. How can we practice ""tikkun olam"" while we savagely repress the legitimate rights of the Palestinians to their national aspirations and their land? Let's stop making heroes out of generals and thugs. The Zionists and the extremist Islamic groups like Hamas are their own best company."
4,One Of The Biggest Teen Idols Of The 1970s,"Donny Osmond... he was one of the biggest teen idols of the 1970s! Relive again his ""teen idol"" era with songs that made him fantasy material for teenage girls the world over such as ""Go Away Little Girl"" (a number one hit),""Too Young"", ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" and of course *the* song, the one most associated with Donny, ""Puppy Love"". They're all here and then some. I think anyone who was around in the 70s and still has a warm place in their heart for these songs should get this CD, it'll bring back great memories. And if you're just discovering this fabulously talented artist, you'll get a kick out of it as well. One important thing to mention is that these are all original recordings, so they'll sound just like they did when you first ran home from the record store and spun them on your turntable... but with a bonus, clean, crisp, CD quality sound!"
1,"Cheap, don't waste your money","I bought these because I thought they were a good deal for the money. I shot it into my rubber target with my cross bow so I could fire my cross bow after hunting to so I didn't dry fire it. After I pulled it out, I noticed that the tip had bent. So much for that tip."
4,But Hold On...,"I haven't pulled out the DVD, but there is also a very nice live CD in the package...and it's not bad...especially since I paid $5.99 for it...These guys were a big influence on the British Invasion and American rock & roll of the sixties. There are not many live performances available..here you will witness the unbelievable harmonies that was their signature. It certainly will go onto my portable player as a valuable part of American rock history."
4,East meets west: great flavor without the FAT,"This cool looking, versatile, perforated hybrid of the time honored kitchen standards of the west: the skillet, and the east: the wok, is both fun to use and makes for some exciting low fat grilling. Can be used on the barbeque grill or stove top, great for vegetables and seafood. When using a rub or other messy spices, we use the skillet-wok outdoors on the grill, which also enhances the flavor. The non-stick surface works really well, but watch out for a hot handle!"
1,Doesn't last!,"The non-stick surface started flaking off on the SECOND use. This seems to be typical of Grilla Gear products, as the non-stick surface started coming off the FIRST time I used their 16 oz. Saucepot."
5,very fulfilling and inspirational. a great cd to wake up to,"I heard this at a friend's house, and automatically loved it. Since I purchased it, it has lived in my cd player almost every day of the week. It is also a great gift to give a friend who may need some encouragement. WONDERFUL!"
5,Inspiring,"This has been one of my favorite CDs for well over a decade. It's powerful, moving music. I recently gave away my original copy, so I just had to buy another copy!"
3,Good System,"I have a tight budget and the RCA Home Theater system was within my price range.The installation instructions were fairly easy to follow,and the sound quality when viewing DVDs is very good.I live in a small apartment,and the effect is immense."
4,Renewed Interest in Gay Erotica,"Being only a casual reader of gay erotica over the years, I was surprised to be taken in by such a strong anthology. I commend Scott and Labonte for highlighting indie literature, particularly the excerpt taken from Henry Flesh's ""Massage."" This excerpt provoked me to read the novel, which I haven't put down since. It's nice to see Scott and Labonte provide a breath of fresh air to an increasingly stale genre by providing a platform for new writers and smaller presses. I look forward with renewed interest to the next Best Gay Erotica."
5,Best anthology I've read in a long time,"I'd gotten pretty burned out on gay anthologies, erotic orotherwise, but this one really renewed my faith. Scott and Labontehave put together a diverse collection of top-notch writers, both familiar and new. The book has many fresh voices and unusal narratives, something I can't say for many gay anthologies. High quality and consistently surprising."
2,Design Problem,"We've had this kit for one day and we've discovered a major design flaw. It rained today, and the spotlights collect water if you aim them upwards (for instance towards a tree). The rubber seal is designed to be water resistant but not water proof. It is not designed to be immersed in water. As a result, the water leaked past the seal where it was now trapped inside the semi-sealed compartment. Light bulb wire will rust out in a matter of a couple weeks under these conditions. I did a search on other review sites and sure-enough, people are having to replace the bulbs every few weeks. Fortunately I identified the problem quickly. I am now considering whether to return them or attempt to fix the design flaw myself. Malibu: Hire an engineer. On the plus side, the light sensor works well."
2,flimsy,"Falls apart if you use it filled close to capacity. I carry 6-8 pairs of sticks, brushes, and 2 sets of mallets, and had the seams burst on me in under 6 months. If you need to carry 5 or fewer pairs of sticks, it's probably fine."
2,Confusing and poorly organized.,"I found this book confusing and poorly organized. It tended to repeat a lot of topics, delve deep into topics that will never appear on the test, and had no references for things that I saw on the test. I would recommend going elsewhere for study material."
1,"Bad if you want info, horrible if you want to pass the test","This book was poorly written, poorly organized, and incorrect in many places. Use this book as 'the' study guide for the exam and you'll fail. Use it as an indication of what may be on the exam and you'll be alright. To make matters worse, I could'nt find any errata material. Basically, look at the book, find out what to study, and find other ways to study it."
2,Not Enough Information & Too Many Errors,"This text did not include adequate coverage of exam topics. The reader is left searching for answers to questions and for additional information using other means. It also contains a number of typos and errors throughout the book. On the positive side, it did not include a lot of extra material not required for the exam (New Riders!). Hopefully for the MCSE candidate interested in taking the IIS 4.0 exam, a new revision of the book will be released soon."
2,Tons of fluff with no substance,"This book will definitely not give you the ""ultimate competitive edge""! One half of the book is basic and useless info on nt security and network config, in which everybody who reads this book should already have plenty of experience. The other half is a haphazard collection of advanced topics with no structure or organization, impossible to understand in the format presented. This book is a huge waste of time and money."
2,Think of Something Else,"This book is very incomplete: it contains no Index Server topics, no SQL Server integration, but has a lot of useless stuff. If you want to study for the exam, you'd better choose another study guide."
2,Confusing Jumble,"This book is the worst study guide I have encountered in my pursuit of the MSCE. I have 5 out of the 6 required certifications, and I realize now that the time I put into this book as an exam preparation has been mostly wasted. I will have to consult other books and learning materials to feel confident about taking the exam. I found it poorly organized, badly written, and lacking in clarity. It is not bad if you simply want a reference manual, but I would advise anyone who wants to pass the exam not to rely solely on this study guide as an educational resource. It is a waste of money."
2,Good for a reference but bad for the test.,"I used all the other books in the series Windows NT 4.0, TCP/IP, Networking Essentials and they were all I needed to ace the exams. However this one barely got me through. It is the worse one in the series by far. However I have not found one nor have others that I know took the exam that cover this exam well. For the IIS test you'll need more than one book. For the other exams the other books in the series are all you need."
3,Decent for a reference. Good in comparison to others.,"I found that after taking the IIS 4.0 twice, few books out there are any good at all for test prep. This one at least covers most of material that's on it. For practice questions it is as poor as the rest. I highly recommend the Transcender tests for any one who actually wants to pass IIS 4.0.-Greg Nichols MCP+Internet, MCSE"
1,Bad choice,I haven't yet read the complete book but so far it seems to be one long story about how great it is and not focusing on teaching. It doesn't get to the point....
2,Not worth the Cash ya pay for it...,"I'm trying to get my last Exam for my MSCE, and found this book to give you the basics, but not enought to pass any simulation exams..."
5,good CD for the price!!!,"This is an excellent set of lullabies. Especially for the price!With that said, watch the first song on the CD- a few minutes into it as you/baby are relaxing the music swells and gets very loud. I loaded this CD onto the iPod I use in my child's room, but I deleted the first song from the ""sleep"" play list. I have given many of these to friends at showers and multiple copies to the local childern's hospital, but I tell everyone to start the CD on track 2. Put the player on repeat and by the time it gets back to the first song the child should be asleep and it won't matter that it gets a little loud."
3,Sony Clock radio,"This is a great radio, but i'm taking it back. It has a nice small footprint, taking up only a little room on a nightstand. The nap feature and dual alarms are very nice features too. My primary reason for returning this radio is that the display is too bright, even at it's lowest setting. It's bright enough to keep me awake at night. At it's highest setting, this clock radio could double as a nightlight. Second, there is no battery backup. Third, the power cord is black. A very sharp contrast for a white clock radio. It just dosent look right."
3,Looks great: with a few minor drawbacks,"This alarm clock/radio is great overall. The alarm and radio stations are very easy to program. There are a few of drawbacks to this clock: 1. The power cord is very thick, and black; whick looks odd with such a small, white clock. 2. There is no battery back-up in case of a power outage or blown fuse etc...kind of scary if you can't afford to be late for work, school etc. 3. The LCD display is always on and is a bit too bright. Overall it's a very handsome, user friendly alarm clock/radio."
2,The Green Light that wouldn't die!!!!,"Great features, love the digital radio tuner/presets and one-touch daylight savings time button . AM reception is decent, but not great.The fatal flaw?-- Even on the dimmest setting, the green display background is still much too bright for a dark room. I have to turn it away from the bed to sleep! -- so whats the point of a bedside clock radio that needs to be turned away from the bed? It's a bit like Kramer from ""Seinfeld"" when the Kenny Rogers Roasters put a neon sign outside his bedroom window!"
5,A Classic of Traditional Liberalism,"In this book, Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn (who was largely responsible for his friend Friedrich Hayek being received into the Catholic Church before he died) has written a very thoughful work that challenges many of the cherished presuppositions of American conservatives. If you are the sort who can stomach reading a whole book online, there is a facsimile copy of it at conservativeclassics dotcom."
3,OEA4 Review,"Product is fine and works, but the company already made an improvement with a similar model. They have the one with the RCA jacks already installed."
4,Ambitious,"The effort and ideas that went into this album are apllaudable, but many songs just seem a little too random in terms of the elements they bring in. I bought this cd for its fusion of jazzy melodies and a foot-tapping beat similar to St. Germain in ""you won't let me rock"". The group does phenomenally in the jazzy songs and organic jams but also likes to break it down into new-school electronica or rap (Papa V. sounds like someone I hear in Thievery Corporation)with lots of changes and effects."
2,How can it be a Pro when it Breaks in two weeks?,"At First I thought this was a great blender, however in two weeks of use the blade stopped turning. I do not have enough faith in the blender to keep it, so I am returning it.I read about another person having the same problem at cooking.com."
1,RB75 Waring Blender NOT for frozen smoothies,"This blender is NOT designed for making smoothies. We purchased three RB 75 models for local families as part of a charitable activity drive to help folks with decreased appetites following radiation therapy.Smoothies (made with frozen fruit, OJ, bananas, and yogurt) were suggested by nutritionists. Each one of the blenders stopped functioning within a six month period. When Waring was contacted they said this blender was not recommended for use with frozen fruit despite what sales people claim. They offered to help reimburse the charity for the loss."
1,"Wont make smoothies (or anything else, now)","I bought this blender to replace my 30 year old 2-speed Oster workhorse. It still works but didnt make good smoothies. I had the Waring about a month and the spinning disc in the base (that moves the blade in the container) came loose. I have tried to screw it back down and it just wont go. Doesnt look like the threads are stripped. I have no idea what is going on with this thing. Sounds like other buyers have had blade issues of one type or another.What a waste of money, and of course, no warranty."
2,Beware - blade comes loose,"We got this one because it looked like it would last a long time, but like many of the other reviewers here, the blade on ours came loose and now it spins freely. I'm super disappointed but I will try the fix suggested by dbphoenix."
2,Broke Within a Week,Looks great and I really liked it during the first three days. Only used it to make smoothies. Now the blade got loose and it is no longer working. Based on other reviews it is a design flaw. Bummer. I didn't read them before.
5,I LOVE this book,"I thought I was getting along with my boyfriend just fine, and that I really didn't need this book. But since we just started living together, I thought it might be wise to get another woman's advice just in case. Well, I'm really glad I did. This book is honest, accessible and fun, offering a bunch of different tips from several different women who have already been there and done that, which have already helped me make living together easier. I get less annoyed with the little things, because now I understand that most everyone goes through these same exact things when living with a guy for the first time. And it's such a quick read, you will want to refer to it again and again. I LOVE this book."
3,Watch your dates!,"The paper dolls in this book actually span the period 1867-1898, unfortunately (I was actually looking for the 1870s!) If you are looking for paper dolls per se, these are very nice, with four dolls (Abigail, Beatrice, Caroline and Daphne) and their accompanying ensembles in full color and considerable detail. However, the clothes are not dated. You'll need some further references to follow the change of silhouette through the decades (try another Dover publication, Victorian Fashions and Costumes from Harper's Bazar 1867-1898 - the two books complement one another)."
3,Paper dolls,"If you are actually looking for paper dolls, these are very nice, but if you are looking for fashion information, the book is not as helpful. The illustrations are not labelled at all, so unless you already know what you are looking at, well, you don't know what you're looking at. Try Victorian Fashions & Costumes from Harper's Bazar, 1867-1898 for research."
2,I don't like them,"Not good for purigen. The small beads slip through. I didn't like the bag even if it worked for Purigen, they just feel cheap and the string is just attached, not threaded through the neck so you can't cinch it tight and tie it. They might as well have just included a loose piece of string for you to tie it with."
5,Works.,The bag is very fine and has the capacity to hold very small filter media. I use it for activated carbon and will use the second for Seachem Matrix. I think this bag is effective.
5,Greatest collection of Christian music I have heard!,"Kathy Mattea's 'Good news' is great news for her listeners. The harmonies are tight with haunting instrumentals. The songs are varied from the gentle ""Christ Child's Lullaye"" to the soul stirring ""Mary Did You Know"". It is a collection for every day, not just Christmas."
4,"Not a ""traditional"" Christmas collection","This is a great Christmas album that is NOT full of cheesy holiday tunes. As the title implies, all songs are religiously themed about the birth of Jesus. ""Mary Did You Know?"" is probably the best know, but the rest are all beautiful. A must have for any Kathy Mattea fan. Her rich alto is a different sound in the world of country music."
5,Best Christmas Album,"Kathy Mattea's ""Good News"" ranks up there with the best Christmas albums of all time. End of speech!!!Paul Baragona Raleigh, NC USA"
5,Good News is outstanding!,"I just got the cd a couple of days ago; I haven't listened to the whole thing yet. But I absolutely adore Mary Did You Know---I've listened to it over and over. It has special significance to me because when I was undergoing cancer treatment 18 months ago, the chaplain at the facility played her guitar at chapel services one Sunday morning and sang this song.I had heard it before and loved it, but that morning it was so moving it nearly brought tears to my eyes. The chaplain's voice was very similar to Kathy Mattea's, too, which just makes it that much neater. Jesus took on human form for US! What a loving God we have! Julie Claussen, Nebraska"
3,I expected more,"I bought this CD for the rendition of ""Mary, Did you know?"". Prefer the male singer (Trent de White)rendition. This song is my all time favorite one."
5,Great Christmas Album!,"One of my all-time favorite Christmas albums. Kathy Mattea doesn't just re-cyle standards, but creates new ones!I've given this CD as a gift many times over."
5,One of the best!,"This is one of my favorite Christmas albums. I was delighted to be able to replace an older copy digitally. I especially love ""Emmanuel""."
5,This Will Put You In The True Spirit of Christmas,"Mattea has it all: down-to-earth beauty; a vivacious, intelligent stage presence; excellent musical taste; and of course that heart-searing voice. Add these qualities to a collection of gospel-oriented Christmas songs and you have a classic CD. If there is such a thing as holy music it's the title track, which will probably leave you in tears of joy."
4,Plenty of room!!!!,"This bag is definitely a good choice for those who want want to carry a decent amount of sticks for either touring or just local gigs. It offers the choice of carrying it as a bag pack, what makes it very handy when handling multiple items at the time of loading or unloading. The construction seems solid, however, be advice: IT IS NOT REAL LEATHER, I knew that before purchasing it so no disappointment here. If you are looking for a real leather bag this is not for you. If you are looking for an spacious bag this one makes a good choice. The reason for the 4 stars is that I still consider is too expensive for a bunch of synthetic materials put together and bearing a logo."
5,Each day a new beginning,"Have been reading this book for many years and now it's so much easier to read thanks to being able to change print size. Love the fact when you order a book, you get it instantly. Have misplaced the book, many times and now don't have to worry about that."
4,Daily Meditations,I've been reading this for about 2 months and find it very helpful in my recovery! I would definitely recommend this book for anyone in AA or NA.
4,Each Day a New Beginning: Daily Meditations for Women,"This is a good book for someone in alcohol recovery. I am a non-drinker and didn't like the references to ""see your sponsor, etc."" I recommend it for someone trying to go straight."
2,Written for 12-Step Programs,"When I purchased this book, I was looking for a daily reader with strong, inspirational stories for women. I did not realize the book was specifically a 12-step book. Although I appreciate the 12-step traditions, I find this book actually reinforces some of the things I was trying to get away from, including extreme emphasis on accepting things as they are. Again, I appreciate the 12-step traditions, including the concept of serenity. However, many people seem to accept things that they actually can change because they do not acknowledge their power to make those changes. In my opinion, this book promotes such a perspective. The other criticism I have is that it is somewhat heavy on God, and even though it may not be explicit, it is clear that this is from a traditional religious perspective. If you are looking for a 12-step book that is God-focused, then this should work for you. If not, I would recommend continuing your search."
5,Cyberlink PowerDVD Review,This software is really excellent to play my DVD movies and tv shows with. I'm really glad I bought it and it works perfectly.
1,Cyberlink PowerDVD 7 Full Version from OC Tech Deals,"I purchased Cyberlink PowerDVD 7 Full Version from OC Tech Deals and received a OEM bundled version that was labeled ""not of resale"". I initiated a ""Comments:"" back to the supplier on 8/29/08 that expressed my dissatisfaction with what was shipped. Their ad on Amazon and the shipping paperwork all referenced PowerDVD 7 Full Version; but they actually shipped an OEM bundled version. I rate OC Tech Deals a 1 (lowest rating) for deceptive advertising and shipping ""non-resalable"" OEM disks. OC Tech Deals never replied to my 8/28/08 comments so customer service also gets a 1 rating!"
5,Excellent Blues Album Featuring Peter Green & Mick Taylor,"This album has some of my favorite blues numbers of all time and features some great songs by Peter Green, who subsequently joined Fleetwood Mac, and Mick Taylor who left the Blues Breakers to join the Stones. The instrumental ""Greeny"" is Peter Green at his bluesy best and ""Curly"" is one of his best rockin' tunes. ""Alabama Blues"" and ""Out Of Reach"" are two slow, mournful songs which feature his fine haunting vocals as well as excellent guitar work. Mick Taylor cuts loose with blistering speed on the instrumental ""Knockers Step Forward"" and John Mayall sings the vocals on one of his classics: ""Mama, Talk To Your Daughter"". All in all this is a great album for any blues fan."
5,Great blues,"I just ordered this album. I had it as an LP back in the 70s. I loved it then, and it will be good to hear it again. I particularly like the instrumental ""Curly,"" which is just a good blues on electric guitar; nothing complex, but played with feeling. No one else has mentioned it, and no one else seems affected by it. (?)"
5,Some of the best '60s Blues Rock EVER!,"A grab bag of rare tracks from the '60s, some of which stand among Mayall's finest. The eight songs featuring Peter Green include some top-notch material that outpaces much of the only album recorded by the Green lineup (A Hard Road), particularly the Green originals ""Missing You"" and ""Out of Reach,"" a great B-side with devastating, icy guitar lines and downbeat lyrics that ranks as one of the great lost blues-rock cuts of the '60s. The set is filled out with a few songs from the Mick Taylor era, the highlight being the vicious instrumental ""Knockers Step Forward."""
2,Only for Mayall Fans,"As a Mayall Fanatic, I enjoy this album for previously unreleased John Mayall, Peter Green and Mick Taylor tracks. There are definitely some great tracks such as 'Out of Reach', 'Greeny', 'Hide and Seek'. But as an overall presentation, it is definitely a collection of second best tracks left off other albums."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"We were given this toaster as a wedding gift 1.5 years ago when it was priced at about $75 at Macy's. IT BURNS EVERYTHING on the lowest setting. The GLUE holding the handle to the glass door MELTS EVERYTIME I turn the toaster on and the handle pops off when I go to take my CHARRED food out of it. The black paint trim and the white ""Toastmaster"" logo wipes right off when you go to clean the front of the glass door. I guess the company doesn't want you to remember who made such a poor product!!"
1,"Burn, baby, burn","This is the worst toaster oven I've ever used. It's impossible to reheat food in it. Everything we've ever put in it has come out burned. Even toasting is also impossible. Bread comes out partly burned, partly untoasted. The timer is useless, because you can't set it to a small enough time to avoid burning whatever you've put in the oven.Ours hasn't exploded, like those of some other reviewers, but steam comes out of the door while it's on. The instruction manual said not to worry about this, but it's a little hard not to, now that we've heard about the exploding ovens. The escaping steam seems to have discolored the handle of the oven, too. The interior of the oven may be easy to clean, but we haven't been able to clean the handle.We're afraid to donate it to a thrift store. Ours will likely end up in the trash after having it only three months. I'm going out to buy another brand tomorrow, and I won't get a Toastmaster again."
1,Danger,"I just had to comment about this. Just like a previous reviewer the front of my oven just exploded! There was nothing in the oven at the time, it was just heating up. Luckily, there was no one in the kitchen at the time. Avoid this thing."
1,Dangerous Product!,"This is a very dangerous product. I only used the oven about 4 times so it was fairly new. I had just turned it on when the whole front of the oven exploded. Glass, the handle and frame work just shot out across the room. Broken glass was strewn all through the kitchen. If anyone was standing in front of it, they could have been seriously hurt. I contacted Toastmaster but they didn't seem to care!"
1,"""DANGER! DANGER! DANGER!""","THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS APPLIANCE, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INJURE ANYONE NEAR IT WHILE IT IS OPERATING. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. I WOULD NOT WANT YOU OR YOUR FAMILY TO BE CUT OR BURNED WHEN IT EXPLODES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AMAZON, GET RID OF THIS!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Major Disappointment,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this item. I have only had this item for 2 weeks now and it's been a major disappointment. It toasts unevenly and the condensation (that you are not to worry about) is problematic. After a few seconds of toasting, smoke/steam? rises from the door of the oven. It is rather scary. It has already discolored the white panel connected to the glass door. I haven't dared to try anything else in it. Fortunately, I can get rid of it and send it back. It has turned me off of Toastmaster for sure."
1,worst toaster in the universe,"i wish i'd read the reviews of this toaster before i bought it. it's a doorstop now. it didn't explode, but it did almost cause a fire by burning two pieces of toast on the lowest setting. in this toaster i have never been able to toast one single slice of bread without burning it, in fact. there's something screwy with the thermostat on it. Don't buy this toaster."
1,Lt/Col,My wife was using the oven to make garlic toast.She was warming the oven when the whole glass front exploded all over the kitchen.Had she been in front of the oven she could have been badley injured.I am now trying to find out if Toaster will do anything about it'This is a very dongerus Kitchen Item and some thing should be done about it.A small child standing in front when it explodes would be badly cut by the glass when it flys out.
1,WARNING - big bang toaster!,"I bought this toaster oven last fall & last night I was preheating it to warm dinner and it blew!!! The door blew right off - broken glass, plastic & metal all over the floor! I'm just glad I wasn't standing any closer to it. I'd contact the maker if I still had my paperwork. Don't buy this hazard! And you'd think for that price it'd be decent, or at least not dangerous!"
2,Good toaster until it explodes,"Don't buy this on a bet. Unlike others here, I didn't have trouble toasting things in this oven, and I didn't use it for much else except broiling cheese on the top of a sandwich. The other night, the toaster oven door popped, crackled and 'exploded' all over the kitchen. Nothing flew hard enough to hurt anything, and the glass seems to be thick enough to explode like saftey glass would. Not too many sharp points, just hundreds of chunks. Pretty surprising, until I read the rest of these reviews."
3,"Poor photos, good read",This is an interesting narrative of the career of Edgar Schmued that is seriously flawed by the very poor reproduction of the photos. The paper is poor quality for photo reproduction; the pictues themselves are dark and muddy. Very disappointing.Much of the text is taken from an autobiography written by Schued himself.
3,Not what I expected,I was expecting this to boost my mileage and performance. Neither has happened. Kinda dissappointed. It still a good filter and the fact that it is reusable is great. I had just hoped for more.
4,I like it,I like this rack. Different size baked goods don't fall through like some racks. Lightweight and sturdy.
2,Does Not Fit Better Together Pan,I fell into the better together trap and got stuck with a rack that does not fit pan. This is false advertisement.
2,Doesn't fit the pans!,"This rack DOES NOT fit in the ""jelly roll"" sheet pans it is sold with. Very misleading. I unwrapped and washed them before I discovered the problem, so now I'm stuck with them. Too bad. I'm not at all satisfied with them."
2,"Don't be fooled by ""Better Together"" promotion","I am pleased with the quality of the grid. However, Amazon promotes buying a jelly roll pan under their ""Better Together"" option. The grid does not fit in the jelly roll pan and therefore, the items are not ""better together"". Save yourself the disappointment and headache of repacking and returning the items if your goal is to use them together."
4,Pirates game pleases.,"I was surprised how fun this game is, once we were able to decipher the instructions. The instructions are worded a little complicated. Game play is pretty quick for a trading card game."
5,Dante's Awsome,"I fell in love with the game. And now, I will most likely fall in love with the anime series. My favorite devil may cry game would have to be devil may cry 3"
3,Volume control!,"The sound control is horrible! They have the dialogue so freakin' low but the gun fires on max. I had to turn up the volume to hear what they're talking about but then get scared s***less when they start shooting and before I can grab the remote control. The subtitle is horrendous too! It lacks and sometime completely saying something different. Anyways, I still like this series. ? I like Dante and the game series so I might be bias here. Anyways, he looks cool, calm and badass as usual. I'm disappointed though, he didn't even use the Devil Trigger :( You’re like, Waaaah?! IKR??? It’s a good fix for DMC fans. Ha. So watch for that and not for deep story or character development or tear jerker or mind opening. It's watchable. This series is packed with actions, how else are you suppose to kill demons ."
5,A great case for your I-zone camera,"If you've owned cameras, you figured there's always a case to safeguard it, since they are quite fragile devices. It was about time I-zone had finally come up with one of its own. This silver-toned case is great for lugging around your I-zone camera, while providing the protection it needs -- and, not to mention keeping your camera free of wear and damage in a cute and stylish way. If you own one, this case is a must-have. It's a sure way to leave your camera scratch-, chip-, and dent-free. Think of it as a small insurance for your I-zone!"
5,Transcendent otherness,"Ian Watson's first novel, published in 1973, was one of his best, and an acknowledged classic of science fiction. Its theme is not a traditional sf topic, but a very intellectually challenging one: language as the means to bridge the gap between human consciousness and the otherness of the objective world. In Watson's fictional ""embededed"" language of the Xemahoas, a Brazilian Indian tribe, ""This-Reality"" is converted into the transcendent pattern of ""Other-Reality,"" which is the world of pure being. The Sp'thra (who represent the essential otherness of the objective world, everything about it that we do not understand) bargain for the brains of speakers of this language, which they desire to learn. At the end, the main character experiences a breakdown of reality and a cognizance of a new state of being, reminiscent of such occurrences in the work of Philip K. Dick."
5,Thought provoking with original SETI implications.,"Contrary to the other reader review of this book I found it to be one of the most thought provoking SF novels ever (this from a thirty year afficianado of Clarke, Asimov, Bradbury et al). Watson weaves an engrossing tale with tanatlising sub plots and questions the very fundementals of language and communication with massive implications for SETI planners and participants. I heartily reccomend this novel to any reader capable of discerning original SF thought from Star Wars 9. It is dissappointingly currently out of print so get down to your library or nag the publisher!"
2,"A slow read, confusing at times.","This book tells three stories about: an experiment involving children, to find out if they can develop their own language with the aid of computer altered English; a secluded Brazilian tribe of people who speak two languages, one which is a drug enhanced version of the other; aliens who are discovered orbiting Earth in a ship while taking an extraordinary interest in the English language. Throw in some politics, and you have a story with much potential. Unfortunately, I found some of the ideas and details a bit hard to follow at times. The overall pace was mostly slow. These factors made it difficult for me to maintain any interest in the ultimate connection of the stories, and I'm certain the author's intended effect escaped me. Interesting at times, though finishing the book was an exercise of discipline. I hoped it would pay off. It didn't."
4,Eternity Aftershave,"It smells wonderful and is a good sized bottle. The smell does dissipates after a little while, but this is not meant to replace your cologne. So, I don't see any problems with that."
4,A Pretty Good Listen,"With nearly 200 hours we prefer the good stories and insight to the television and so my wife and I look forward to the new tapes as they become available. His writing style leaves us able to recognize landmarks in our southwestern travels.William Tel is one of my favorite L.L. charactors, so when he travels to Louisiana to find his missing brother Orin the reader is in for a great story. The listener will come to realise that no one messes with ""family.""I admittedly perfer the longer books which enable the listener to become more involved with the charactors. None of the books will dissapoint."
3,louis lamour,Almost all of louis Lamour novels are easy reading. They keep me interested and can lay the book down for a few days and start right back up where I have left it.The Sacketts are always an interesting series.
4,Another Great Sackett Adventure,This is another great Louis L'Amour story involving the Sackett family. It is as entertaining as ever and an easy read for relaxation.
5,Treasure Mountain: Sacketts,This was an audiobook gift for my 94 year old mother who loves the Louis L'Amour books about the Sacketts! She loved it and will listen to it again!
5,Sad but good,"Very sad ending, but excellant reading. A real tear jerker when you come to an the end. Since 1967 I have read hundreds of books written by this author. He never fails to keep my mind active."
1,I should have read the reviews,"This book is full errors. Examples: Don't use aspirin and warfarin together, all copies of the DEA222 are sent to the DEA after being filed out by a pharmacist. I stopped taking the practice tests after 90 questions because I am afraid this may actually worsen my score due to all the wrong information. I don't think this book was written by a pharmacist."
3,Only option available,"It's an okay music video, but since it's the only one that the BoDeans have out you have little choice if you want to watch them at home. The sound and video quality are ok. I have no idea why they decided to fade the tracks and rearrange the concert song order for the DVD release. It's annoying and distracting. Still, they are one of my favorites and I enjoy watching this video release."
4,A fun way to use statistics,"This book uses statistics to demonstrate that ""truths"" that we often site just are not proven when we look at the numbers. A good read"
1,Uneven cooking,"After 25 years our GE waffle iron started showing signs that we needed to replace it. Our compaison of the Toastmaster 218 is based on the years of excellent waffles we have been used to.Although compact and easy to use, the heating was very uneven. The center of the waffle baker towards the handle was dark, and the corners very light. The waffles were on the soggy side, and not crisp on the outside like they were with the GE. If we let them cook longer, they became dried out. We used one of our favorite waffle recipies that worked great with the GE.For someone new to waffles, this may be an okay waffle iron, but for someone that truely loves a good waffle, stay away from this one."
4,Nice waffle maker but bad light...,I liked the waffle maker. only thing i dont like about it is the indicator light. it is not very bright and i have to turn my light out in the kitchen so i can see when the waffles are done. other than that its great.
5,Attention: Only read the new translation by Tim Wilkinson,"Anyone who reads the poor first translation of Fateless and the shamefully bad translation of Kaddish cannot even get close to the true spirit of the original works.Thanks to Tim Wilkinson English speakers can finally enjoy these excellent books.Look for the titles ""Fatelessness"" and ""Kaddish for an Unborn Child"", both translated by Wilkinson. These new editions are at last worthy of the originals and the Nobel Prize.(See also October 16, 2002 review by Marton Sass)A movie based on the novel Fateless is also out with English subtitles; don't miss it, if you have a chance. Beautiful work."
3,Detached,"My online bookgroup read this book a few weeks back, but I couldn't put my hands on a copy in time. Then I received the offer to join a bookring for it at BookCrossing.The setting, a concentration camp during World War II, and the main character, a Jewish boy, have been done many times, but never quite this way. Our main character, George Koves, has a strangely detached point of view during the time he spent in the camp. Though he almost starves to death at times and is beaten and sees others put to death, Koves finds solace in the experience. His experiences are related philosophically, as if he is trying to get to the deepest truths."
2,Kinda boring,"With all due respect the book was more like a vague overview of his experience, almost as if being specific might have been more than he could handle. I have read a few better personal accounts."
5,"Yes, a power supply IS included","For some reason, the product photo only shows the IDE-to-USB cable, and not the power supply cord that comes with it. (Actually you can click on one of the thumbnails to see a photo of the whole kit) I found this to be an extremely satisfying piece of equipment to use -- a terrific value! A driver is included for Windows 98 systems. I've tried it on both XP and Vista systems and they recognized the external drive automatically. I swap it back and forth between my old computer's hard drive (which I use for backups) and its CD-RW drive (my new computer only has one optical drive, so this speeds up disk copies)."
4,Good product,I was using my old hard disk within two minutes after opening the package. Works great does not need any external driver on windows xp. Much better choice over hard drive enclosures which are difficult to set up. I am giving it four stars because it does not come with instructions.
1,doesnt work,"I bought this product but it really didnt worked for me. Dont knw what happend, but I swapped the usb to ide attachment with my friend and it worked for both us for few days. then it completly stopped working. i wud suggest to spend $10 more and get something reliable than to waste time on this."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!,This scale did absolutely nothing that it claims to do. I measured the same can of beans 10 times and got a very different weight every single time... It has absolutely no redeeming qualities. I think it is a shame that [they] sell it. Don't even think of buying it...:(
1,The accuracy of this scale is extremely questionable!,"I checked both the 4 lb model and the 11 lb model of the Soehnle Culina Scale for accuracy. For weights, I used different sized soup cans. Not only did the two scales give me different readings, neither of the two gave readings that matched the actual weight of the soup cans! The 11 lb model was often wrong by as much as 6 oz. Furthermore, neither scale returned to zero after measuring an item. You have to zero it for every single measurement. Another problem with these scales is that they are are not particularly useful for weighing items for mailing. The box says they can be used as a mailing scale, but when you put anything wider than 5"" on top of the scale, you can't read the measurement. It is obviously designed for bowls, not packages. I returned both the 4 lb and 11 lb models since they are both useless when you want accurate measurements."
1,Useless scale,"Despite its attractive design and cost, this scale functions so poorly, it cannot be said to function at all. It gives wildly inconsistent readings, making its ""zeroing"" feature useless and claims to accuracy a joke. I advise amazon.com to discontinue this item, which I returned for a refund after purchasing a perfectly accurate Polder kitchen scale for half the price."
5,I'm happy,"I am very happy with my scale. I love its simple mechanical design. My measurements are always repeatable and my zero point is consistent. It is very convenient for baking - I add the ingredent, then zero the scale again, then add the next one. My biggest problem - before I had the scale I kept finding recipes by weight, and having to guess. Now it seems all my recipes are by volume, and I have to guess again anyway!"
3,Read it in one sitting!,"This was very funny and I couldn't put it down till I'd finshed. However, all entries were credited to the fans who submitted them, and about half way through I found I was glancing ahead for Roger Ebert's own contributions -- signed R.E. His were the best and often the ""amateur"" entries seemed like filler in comparison. I had the feeling Mr. Ebert doesn't like to reject anyone's offering . . . which actually made me think he must be a sweetheart. (Here's one: almost every time there's a scene in a big city police precinct, you can see in the background one or more colorfully dressed prostitutes being hauled in. Usually they're bickering loudly with the cops.)"
3,"Fun, good gift","This book is a lot of fun, but all of the criticisms by ""A reader from Mid-West"" are valid. As such, the book makes for a nice gift to get a movie lover (and a pleasure to receive as a gift), but buying it for oneself is somewhat of a waste of money. Hopefully if there is another edition some aggressive editing will be done to take out ideas repeated under different names, etc."
4,Crucial equipment for any film buff,"My only complaint is that it is, as the name says, little. I want MORE. It's funny, it's true, and it shines all kinds of light on cinema."
1,Kindle version not what is advertised,"The kindle version of this book does not match the title. It is not, in fact, Ebert's ""Bigger""Little Movie Glossary, but the previous, non-""bigger"" title. False advertising."
5,AAAAHHHHHH!!!!! ANTIQUES OF DEATH!!!!!,"You will really appreciate this book after you've read through it two or three times. After that, you'll find yourself watching a movie and yelling out, ""fruit cart!"" or ""antiques of death!"" thereby cracking yourself up, and irritating those around you who haven't been blessed with this book. :) The best thing to do is this: buy it, make your friends buy it, and spend some time reading your favorites out loud to each other. Then the more movies you watch, the more cliches you'll start spotting, and even bad movies will be more entertaining."
4,These bad boys rock,"When you need a good, bulk loading caulk gun, this is the one to buy.Easy to use, easy to clean.Just wish they didn't cost so darn much."
4,Better than Noe's other selections,"Decent storyline and thread. Artwork is sketch with watercolor, so expect softer lines and details than Kevin J. Taylor's work. Personally I liked this title better than Doctor I'm Too Big, which had a pretty blah story, and too few panels per scene (important for any graphic novel to provide continuity and flow.) This title ""Ship of Fools"" does have single cels of the aforementioned bestiality and bondage, but I'd consider them NC-17 rather than X (similar to the difference between a Hollywood murder on film, versus a snuff film) - there are paperback reading books far more graphic in those areas than this title. Contrary to other reviews, I considered the action scenes depicted in Noe's titles to be much tamer than Taylor or Belore illustrates, but that may be due to the limited number of continuity frames per scene."
4,A deep appreciation of the human form,"Whether or not you appreciate themes of rape, demon sex, and political coups, it is hard not to appreciate Noe's beautifully rendered human figures. This artist shows his (gender?) deep love and fascination for all parts of the human body not just the naughty bits. The characters have beautiful curves, glorified but not unrealistic muscular form. The male genitalia in particular are lovingly crafted, with extreme detail. The story itself is quite amusing with a political facade thrown in to justify the ravaging and ultimate salvation of our heorine. Of course, I didn't buy this bit of literature for the literary content."
5,My birds,Are loving these pine cones. I have 2 cockatiels and 2 cinnamon green cheek conures. The pine cones are getting great reviews from them.
5,sexy frau,"in england two things you would not normally associate germans with are humour and sexiness [hey, it's a national pastime!], especially the latter. but that would be a grave misjudgment because the female half of the duo has the kind of crystal clear, breathy voice that was made for serenading... the music? a slowburning electronica heaven that is gentle and non-aggressive... sort of silje nergaard meets susumu yokota... irregular beats, some wondrous melodies, like ""morgen""... filesharing is one of those rare albums, like goldfrapp's felt mountain, that has its own distinctive sound without seeming repetitive or complacent. every track stems from the same source but holds its own fort... me likes... but a word of warning, beautiful as i feel it is, this wont appeal to all tastes... definately worth a try...."
2,Flat,"Here's a formula... Make a couple software based synthesizer loops, sing over them, and make money! I really wanted to like this album, but this is too trendy for it's own good. Music should be enjoyable, or at least, you should be able to appricate what the artist(s) have tried to achieve. Here, it just seems like not much work was put into the songs. AGF sings beautifully but her great vocals just seem flat underneath the minimal electronic music. Not worth your money."
2,Head in the Sand,"What could have been a fascinating tale about a boy who just couldn't say no is told in a trite high-school note manner whispered over the shoulder in Health Class. The author lacks writing ability but makes up for it in gossip, kiss-n-tell and anecdotes worthy of the Starr Report. It's a shame Cal Culver didn't sleep with Arthur Miller. We'd have gotten a tale worth reading two-handed."
3,READ BEFORE BUYING!!!,"Are really referring to the reviews to figure out whether or not you are going to buy this movie: the animated, straight to video sequel to Kangaroo Jack on VHS. IT'S ON VHS HOW MUCH THOUGHT COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE PUTTING INTO THIS PURCHASE? Come on if you're going through the trouble of looking down here you might as well get it right?"
4,Cute kangaroo movie,"I got this for my 4 year old. He didn't pay too much attention to it, he was only 3 at the time I got it, but the adults liked it a lot. He will like better soon though. A very cute movie."
1,Highly Problematic DVD Player/Recorder,"We actually got this player bundled with a purchase of a Samsung LCD display. The display is great; the DVD player isn't. The player has difficulties even with store bought DVDs. For example, I have a store-bought region 0 DVD (playable on all players with any region code) that this player can't read. None of my friends and family have a problem viewing these DVDs on their players. It also has problems with reading homemade DVDs I burn myself (i.e., some work, most don't). In short, I would recommend avoiding this player and instead spend your money on something more reliable."
1,Not compatible with other brand DVD player,"The recorded DVD can not play properly on my Panasonic player. It seems never go from one chapter to the next by itself. You have to go to the main menue all the time. Reverse, forward and skip functions work but when you press play key, it freezes and stops."
1,Samsung DVD-R130 DVD Recorder,The Samsung DVD-R130 DVD Recorder is the worst dvd recorder ever made; it records your shows just fine. But when you go to watch them it says it can't read the disc. It has no problem reading the disc during the recording session but it can't read what it records. Only an Idiot would buy this recorder. I for one will not buy a Samsung product again.
2,"Buggy, problematic bad buy","When it works, it is great. I love the idea of a dvd recorder. This actual recorder, however, has been a problem from day 1. Often the drawer refuses to open for no real reason at all, turns itself off and won't turn back on. We'd learned to work around a couple of idiosyncracies, but as it is aging, the problems are spreading. We have to unplug it at least once a day just to get it to open the drawer."
3,RESET THE UNIT WORKS FINE NOW,"HAVE THIS RECORDER SINCE CHRISTMAS HAD ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS WITH RECORDING, FREEZING UP,RECORDING THEN NOT PLAYING BACK,HAVING TO UNPLUG UNIT SIX TIMES IN ONE MONTH.BUT LAST WEEK I CALLED SAMSUNG AND TALKED TO SOMEONE WHO ACTUALY NEW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS UNIT, AND IS EVERYONE WHO OWNS THIS UNIT READY.TO FIX ALMOST EVERY PROBLEM GO TO THE PLAYER AND PRESS AND HOLD THE CHANNEL UP AND DOWN BUTTONS AT THE SAME TIME UNTIL ON SCREEN DISPLAY SAYS UNIT HAS BEEN RESET.DO THIS WITH NO DISC IN THE MACHINE.I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS SINCE.NO WHERE IN THE MANUEL IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.GOOD LUCK WITH YOURS."
1,Unit never worked,"This unit is a real clunker. Right out of the box it had audio synch problems where the sound was not in synch with the picture. I sent unit out to a Samsung recommended repair shop and it took six weeks for unit to be fixed. When unit was returned it stll was not working. Samsung is stalling in sending out a shipping label so unit can be fixed a second time. The second time around I will probably have to wait another six weeks for unit to be returned. So teach yourself a lesson and don't but this or any other Samsung product, their products and customer service are terrible."
1,Poor Product Unreliable Company,My dvd recorder stopped working after less than one year and Samsung refused to repair or replace it.
3,good tire,"Would of been better if the person who pulled it from the bottom of the pile was here to help me inflate the damn thing. It was flattened like a truck was sitting on it for several years, yet it came in a box 4x its size. Figure that one out, lol."
2,Unsure,Service OK. Product doesn't seem to be as effective as what I previously bought in a drugstore. I will probably search for it locally instead of ordering if I decide to try it again.
5,Educational and fun for all ages,"This game is fun for all ages, some questions are too hard for late elementary kids and those are the ones the parents get. Others are vice versa and are things that only a kid in recent years would know. That makes it fun, because unlike other trivia games where parents can dominate kids, the power changes hands frequently. I have a set at home and one at school. I am a teacher and I also pull this out when I have a few extra minutes at the end of class. Now, instead of chatting for the last few minutes, they ask me to quiz them. I choose the Earth section and they apply to my science class well. For the price and ease of travel, you can't go wrong. You can also buy the Home version and swap out the cards to get new questions."
3,Not the greatest,"Usually like Hagen Products, but this one needs some work. A drawstring closer works so much better, than trying to tye the top of the bag close with the attached string. I would not purchase this type again."
4,Good Bags,"These are pretty useful, does the job. Like everyone else I have to complain that these do not have drawstrings, they must be tied."
2,not good for purigen,"i got this for using purigen, a renewable filter media. i got the bag that was specifically made for it and it was over 8 bucks.i thought i could save a bit of money and use this one. well i have little white purigen beads floating all over and my dumb fish is tryin gto eat them.i would use this with carbon media but nothing else. it's not super fine and not durable.i'm not made though, because they don't say it was made for purigen."
3,not as wrinkle resistant as i'd expected,"stitching on the pocket was broken in bottom left corner. and I still have to iron the shirt when it comes out of the dryer, as opposed the the wrinkle resistant shirts I have from LL Bean."
2,Indifferent quality,"These shirts are clearly far from wrinkle-free. I was surprised at how much ironing my white shirt needed. Further, the stain on the collar from sweating did not come off too well. The only reason this shirt does not get 1 star is because it was cheap and that the white color looked good - not a dull white like bad quality or older shirts."
2,Wrinkles upon washing,"I was warned by the reviews I read before I bought this shirt, but I thought it might be worth a try because of the price. If they hadn't said it was wrinkle free and stain free I wouldn't think too much of the shirt, but I wouldn't buy it again. However, it has to be ironed each time and there is no way anyone would wear it without ironing it."
1,Not the Original Recordings,"This is a remake. If you remember the original White Christmas this CD will greatly disappoint you. If you want the original White Christmas and The Bells of St. Mary you should order ""Clyde McPhatter & the Drifters/Rockin' & Driftin' Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters ""."
3,"Not finding the Drifters classic recording?,","If you're looking for the wonderful Doo-Wop classic recording of White Christmas by The Drifters, it's the feature track on the ""White Christmas and Other Doo Wop Christmas Classics"" CD, also available on Amazon.Other CD versions:Clyde McPhatter & the Drifters:""Rockin' & Driftin' Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters""- and -""Soul Christmas"""
1,broken on arrival,DOA - dead on arrival - can't stand that I wasted my time and money on something that won't even turn on.
3,You get what you pay for!,"Not a bad price, but the sound is not loud at all. One must be sitting right up next to it to hear anything. For the price, I guess I cannot complain though."
4,Good value,"Bought so daughter could listen to Samsung mp3 while getting ready for work. Sound is sufficient for bedroom and outside on patio. Especially when you see how small it is: about 6 inches by 3 inches. A/C adaptor saves on batteries. Not able to adjust tone, but that wasn't an issue in this case. Good value. Amazon had the best price, too."
4,6 watts sounds like 16,"I ""field tested"" this last summer in Albania under some pretty difficult conditions (no electricity). For a small unit, it delivers good sound. You'll never get great bass from a unit of this size, but amazingly you can get quite a bit of bottom end and room-filling volume. Used with my iPod, I was very impressed with the output and it filled a classroom with music. It was essential that the students hear English lyrics clearly and the Genius delivered in this area also. It can run on batteries or AC and I was impressed that my rechargable batteries lasted all week. A friend heard this unit and had to have one!"
1,Quit working after 3 hours,I bought this product because I wanted to be able to listen to my MP3 player without headphones or ear buds. This MP3 docking station seemed to be perfect - or at least it was for about three hours. That is how long the product worked before it quit. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
3,"good but expensive, old, easily replaced","Your time for oral board prep should be focused on seeing as many high yield images as possible with the least amount of time and money invested. Though the discussions/cases are good in this book, there are are only 30 cases/10 chapters covered. The book costs about $100. You could buy two to three ""case review series"" books with the same investment. These books have 200 cases each. Personally i have not found a case book that describes cases as you should on boards- findings, differential diagnosis, most likely diagnosis and additional comments. Wiser choices are available"
4,For the Board Exams,"Having recently written the US and Canadian Boards for radiology, and having done umpteen CD roms and teaching files, I found this book to be one of the most organized and focussed in preparing for board discussions. It covers a wide spectrum of cases and gives pointed pertinent positives and negatives when reviewing the differential. Granted, it is not completely comprehensive (but then, there is no single book that is... oh, if only there were) It is not a book that I would start studying with, but, in the end, near the final few weeks, it is a good quick read (1-2 days)to test yourself and pick up some pointers (it is also much cheaper than the course itself!)."
3,"great writing, but too much whining from the protagonist's part","Second instalment of Pyat's quartet...and though the writing is great, one feels tired after the hundreth tirade of the whining, self pityoing, self-glamorizing Pyat. his comprehension of hs times is limited, and his mawkish sentimentalism, combined with his frankly unpalatable racism make a very unpleasant combination. I don't know of others, but I prefer a protagonist I can empathize with, not an individual whose endorsement of the abject, evil ku-klux-klan exacted my utter distaste. But I could have overcome this, I suppose, had I not been bored with Pyat's annoying droning on the fact he practically invented everything that's been invented, that modernity is evil, that it's all the fault of the jews and so on and so on and so on...."
1,Dont Bother,"This stopwatch sucks. The switches need to be debounced. The switches ""double press"" most of the time so my times are all invalid. Also the mode button should NOT cycle through clock and date set. This POS is getting returned."
3,temporary tattoos are great!!,"We purchased the tattoos for halloween. They were easy to apply and would be a great precursor for choosing a permanent tattoo. Be advised however, they are ""NOT"" easy to remove."
1,Worst CD,"listening to this CD is like listening to the worst music ever, trust me and never buy this cd, it's like listening to back round mucis at fred myre while trying to wait for a person to answer the phone that is what this music is like, ever sound has a flute playing and flutes in songs suck!"
1,Color choices limited/dictated by seller,"As a customer, I have to ask, why, if there is an ""assortment of colors"" available, none of which are listed, I should pay money for a pot luck color that the seller chooses? From a customer perspective, I simply cannot understand the reasoning behind this. Although I like the product and the idea, sorry, I will not be purchasing a product from a company that will dictate to me a choice that should be mine. In my book, this is not a level of customer service I will tolerate."
4,What do you expect... ?,"It's a hard-boiled egg cooker. Nothing fancy here but it does work. We've really enjoyed ours. My oldest son loves hard-boiled eggs but I've always been afraid of letting him make them on the stove because I'm sure he'll walk away and forget. This unit has a loud buzzer that alerts you when they're done (or when the time is up). It works, it's safe, it's fun... It's an egg cooker................ :) Hope this helps."
5,lexisandlogan@yahoo.com,"I picked mine up at a garage sale for 1 dollar. I thought, It's only a buck. My husband tried it 1st. The buzzer did kind of startle him. You do know when its done. The eggs peeled so well, the shells almost fell off when you first hit it with a knife. I tried it for the 1st time today. I was prepared for the buzzer, it really wasn't that bad, but do know when it's done. One of the best things I've ever bought for a dollar. The only thing, It didn't come with an owners manual, but I'm sure I can get one online."
1,Doesn't measure up,"I'm returning this item without using it because the product description is wrong. The description indicates it will poach up to four large eggs. The manual clearly states that it will poach four medium eggs. That's not the same. I always buy large eggs and that's what I wanted the egg cooker for. Also, it was not clear to me that there are only two cups for poaching. My old Sunbeam cooker had four cups - one for each egg,"
4,Eggcooker,"The product is very good, the only problem is it is always like rolling the diece when you put water in the measuring cup. It has to do with the level of the ocean and some states it will cook faster some slower....but otherwise I love the product!"
2,Extra long is extra short,Bought this for our monaco windsor. Really thought the description would fit our needs. Unfortunately it is not extra long at all!. On the positive side the front zippers are great to adjust to the mirrors to prevent tearing. Would have been happier if it fit flush with the cargo drawers. It is about 1 foot short on both sides :(.
2,Not For Baking,"This scale might be fine in situations where accurate and precise readings aren't important, but it is not the one to buy for baking.True, there are markings in 1 oz. increments, but they are too close together to be read very accurately. Also, the angle from which you view the reading can make it look as if it's a little over or a little under the amount you are shooting for.Using a conversion chart in a time-tested cookbook, I converted a recipe into ounces. I had a difficult time telling whether I had the correct amount of an ingredient because of the combination of the small markings and relatively large needle on the scale. I knew I needed to return it and purchase a different one when what should have been about 2 cups of flour (by weight) was closer to 3.This scale may be fine for applications where close is good enough, but if you are interested in baking by weight or in portion control for diets, you'd be best served by looking at another scale"
