5,Isis Book Review,The is the best book I have seen on the goddess. The author understands the needs of the followers of Isis. I couldn't put this book down I wanted to know and read more. Everyone that follows Isis/Aset should read this book!
5,A thoroughly readable introduction to an ancient goddess,"My curiosity was immediately aroused as I viewed the curious spine and title of this book. Looking at the cover, I knew I had discovered a potentially pleasurable read. Even though I am not a goddess worshipper, I thoroughly loved this book. My buried curiosity about ancient Egyptian culture and worship has re-emerged thanks to De Regula's passionate and informative chapters. I am now an ""Egypt Nut Reborn!"""
4,WHY IS THIS BOOK SO FREAKING EXPENSIVE?,"I went to the local library and was able to loan out the book for a while. It's an excellent read, loaded with so many good cross-references. My biggest pet peeve is why does it have to cost so much? It's an awesome book, but I shouldn't have to mortgage my home to purchase it. Come on. We are still in a recession."
4,Good quality kaleidoscope,This kaleidoscope was a stocking stuffer for one of my daughters for Christmas. It is a good quality kaleidoscope and is far better than the cheap plastic ones I've come across. We haven't run into any issues with its use and it is holding up well.
3,Old style toy that never loses appeal,Kids enjoy pointing it at different light sources and playing with it. Doesn't have alot of staying power for them but seems durable and better constructed than most on the market.
1,Dented,"Our Classic Tin Kaleidoscope arrived with a huge dent in it not in a separate box but thrown in with another item we ordered, and the return policy would not include shipping the item back, the cost for shipping would be more then the Kaleidoscope itself, so we kept the dented version, it works fine, but the dented casing is not a good sell....would recommend to make sure this gets shipped with a trustworthy company that knows how to wrap an item."
5,It's such a great thing not only for children :),"It's not perfect, because the colored stones are made of plastic, not of glass. But the ornaments and colors are quite nice :)"
4,Lots of fun and geometry for very little money.,"I purchased this for inspiration in designing kaleidoscope artwork. The geometric shapes in the design are easy to examine, and the colors are nice and bright without being too common and cloying. It looks like jewels. Lots of good, clean fun."
3,Came to us broken.....,"This could have been a very enjoyable product....it is made of tin and would seem to hold up well in ""little"" hands. However one of the prisms inside seems to be broken so you don't get the ""true"" kalidascope experience. As a Christmas gift we were unhappy with it as a gift for one of our grandchilden...hard to explain to a youngster how it ""should look"" when you use it."
3,Fun Novelty,"The quality of both the scope and the music box is mediocre, but it's a fun novelty. This toy is sturdy, so it would be a good first kaleidoscope for a child."
4,Kaleidoscope is appropriate for a four-year old,"Not as spectacular in patterns as I remember as a child, but it will be fascinating for my 4-yr old grandson. The tin outside is very nice and colorful and in excellent condition."
3,SO cool... sadly mine had dents in the tin!,"My daughter has lately been into looking into holes. Or pretending her hands are glasses and looks through them. I thought this would be great for her. So she can see all the pretty patterns this kaleidoscope makes. It is very nice a good size and seems durable. I think the overall appearance is so cute. I got this for her Christmas present. When I first opened the packaged I didn't really examine it. But now that I am starting to wrap gifts, there is two dents on the side of it. It made me upset that I didn't notice it. There not huge but just upsetting that I received a defective toy. But I know my daughter won't even notice it. But this gift does have a great potential!******UPDATE*********I was upset my product was damaged so I sent an email to the seller and they sent me a new one right away at no charge. I am happy with their great customer service!!!"
5,Couldn't find it anywhere else!,"I looked high and low in the Big Box stores and small local businesses, and couldn't find a kaleidoscope at any price. When I found this online, it turned out to be a high-quality item that only cost about a third of what I was prepared to spend for a good one. I almost hated to part with it! My four-year-old nephew, who is already hooked on video games, actually thought it was pretty cool."
4,Cute,I love tin toys. They remind me of toys I had when I was a kid. This is well made and will probably last a long time. I think kids will enjoy it. It's a great stocking stuffer for adults too.
3,No childhood memories,"The product's outer shell looks exactly like pictured. Product has beads in shapes of stars, flowers, the letter ""S"", cylinder, etc. These beads are very recognizable when you look into the kaleidoscope, so they don't make interesting patterns/colors as the ones that I used to own as a kid. If my memories serve me right, it didn't have those ""typical"" shapes and made mesmerizing patterns of colors at every turn.However, this kaleidoscope is fine if you're buying for a youngster.If you're looking for one that could take you back on the first time when you looked into a kaleidoscope, I recommendG.W. Schleidt KS135-40B Kaleidoscope Wooden Base Light Continent French Motif. This is an adult version and looks cool enough to be used as an executive desktop piece also."
5,It is hard to see than it is to believe!!!,"I came across this doc on the sundance channel which when i wrote to had no response about the film, I tried to tell them to please air the film again because i'm starting to believe it is the only way i will ever get of copy of this film which is a must see but is harder to find than anything i have ever been after. if your inclined to seek out this as thought i have contact Galafilm website it seems to be the only one who is selling the film over the phone and payment by check. hopefully though this film will reach the public when the stars of this disaster are no longer living to block it from the market. good hunting!!"
3,"Okay to start here, but go to the library later...","Miller's book is not very well written and his insights and commentary are extremely dated and often annoying and intrusive. However, for novices to this area of history, or just for plain old good fun, ""Shady Ladies"" provides brief overviews of some of the West's most fascinating women. Calamity Jane, Lola Montez and Mammy Pleasant are given the more in-depth treatment that they deserve. Also, the author provides a dictionary of terms in the index, which for those of us not familiar with terms like ""lady of the line"", is quite helpful. Buy the book for general background information or for fun. Go to the library for serious research. Overall an okay read."
3,"Right at the core, sloppy with the details.","As a scientist working in the bio-industry, I felt compelled to read this book. Unfortunately, while it makes a number of good points and correctly identifies areas of uncertainity, it somewhat marres the pleasure of reading it by suboptimal craftmanship - incidentally one of the criticisms that are correctly made to our industry. I resented some factual mistakes and the impression that the book was not proofread before going to print, leaving it with some contradictions and loose ends. But, I repeat, the essence is right: ""wait a minute!"""
2,Fun for a while but breaks way too easily,"This is a cool little gadget that kids enjoy playing with for a short period of time. Its main problem is its fragility--the one we bought broke literally before we left the store. We glued it back together at home and it lasted for a while, but then it broke again. In sum, it's fun for a little while--about as long as it will take to break."
2,Too expensive here,"Great case, snaps tightly, not too flimsy--and $0.99 at the local discount stores (Wal-Mart, etc.)"
5,good book,This has turned out to be a great story to read to my grandchildren. We discuss how are feelings affect others. Thanks.
2,Poorly made...,The story is cute and so are hte pictures but the book literally fell apart. THe envelope at the end of the story where you put all the cut out masks came out the first time we tried to slide the pictures in. The noses all came off of the masks too. IT's like the glue that held it all together was compromised in some way. Maybe it was left on the tar mac too long and suffered heat damage? Not sure... I would say not worth it unless you plan on not using the masks or the envelope in back. Waste of money.
2,"Cute idea, but not practical for rambunctious toddlers","I purchased this book to talk about feelings with my almost two year old son. Unless you have a child that is VERY careful with handling books, trying to play with the fold-out masks is more frustrating than a learning tool. He didn't want it on his face and it worried him that it was on mine. Needless to say, we've used this book once and then I put it up.Cute idea, but I would think that this would be for a more mature toddler or the preschool set."
2,Happy Monster/Sad Monster not so Happy!,"Sorry to say that after reading our Go Away Big Green Monster, and kids requesting it so often, not just at Halloween and with having many craft ideas to go along with it for the kiddos, I was quite disappointed that this was not a similar type book but with a different theme. It wasn't along the same lines at all for us and after a few reads and many wandering eyes (lack of interest) it has remained on our book rack since then and has not been chosen at free reading. :("
5,A great gift book with a super message,"Yellow monsters, green monsters, purple monsters-They all have feelings. Sometimes they are happy about birthday presents and other times they are worried by seeing little creepy-crawly things. This is a book to help children put the right words and faces to the emotions they are feeling or are seeing in others.The colors in this book are wonderful. All the story pages are black and glossy with bright, multi-colored pictures. Children will be drawn to the fun monsters and their explanations for their current emotions. Each emotion comes with a child-sized mask that can be torn out and used. There is a wonderful pocket inside the back cover to store the masks.Colorful, cute, educational and entertaining, Glad Monster, Sad Monster will make a great gift book.Armchair Interviews agrees."
1,total crap!!!!!!!! not worth 2 bucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I rented this game to play with my little sister when I babysat her. Well its not even a game! you watch your pikachu watch tv. thats all you do! accasionally pikachu will want to buy something on the shopping channel but usually you watch your pikachu watch tv.and the shows are crap. there is even a relaxation channel as if I wasnt bored enough. and since all of the pokemon can only say their name you have to turn on the subtitles. and you can only watch a certain amount of shows each day so you have to wait or reset your system clock. even if you like pokemon you will hate this game dont buy it
3,Eh... Kinda Worth the Price,"This is a stupid game. Watching Tv with a Pikachu is boring. The Pokemon Mini is a nice additon, but the game is mediocre in its own ways, like on some channels, including the Smoochum Shapeup Channel. Like, Pokemon excercising? Duh! Too uninteresting to watch. Quizzing Wobbuffett? Weird. Shoppin Squirtle is ok, but my only VERY favorite channels were the Pichu Brothers in Party Panic series of channels! The best additions are the Magnamites delivering electronics and the Delibird delivering Shoppin Squirtle merchandise! I advise you to rent this game, but if you are an e-reader fan or Pokemon fan, then buy it for that good price."
3,Pretty Okay,"At first I just thought it was a Pokemon game that Nintendo threw out there because they hadn't made one in a while. When I started to play it the little Pikachu came in and wants to watch T.V.. Cute right. He suppodely enjoys later to much that he Thunderbolts it just for fun. O'well. You can blow easy earned pika points from the Wobuffett quiz show on Shopping with Squirtle which is actually pretty fun because there is alot od coll stuff. There is a exercise program that Pikachu does with the T.V. and a news channel with a lazy Psyduck. Plus you can take Pikachu outside if you are too bored with the Tube and go place and see alot of good graphically made Pokemon. In conclusion it really is only a step above Hey you Pikachu.(without the mic, THANK GOD!) I do however recommend it for 11 and below."
3,pkmn channel,it sounds realy cool and i herd on the game you get to watch tv and that soubds neat pretty much it and i am rentin it today and i migh get it for christmas
2,"At turns, tiring",2 1/2A few invigorating tracks of this minimalist dread-n-bass can not cancel out a majority of underdeveloped indulgences.
4,A MUST read,Interesting and eye opening reading. This book should be required reading for anyone who deal with people either on a personal or professional level (which is probably all of us unless you're in a monastery). His techniques offer a new paradigm for dealing with people.
4,Better than I expected.,"I've been searching for Assertiveness Training books and this was the first one that I purchased. The stories were great and I immediately used them. I went throught this book quick. If you're looking for Assertiveness Training books then I suggest, When I Say No, I feel guilty. There are actually exercises in there that you can go over with a friend or relative. That book has impacted my life more than Verbal Judo."
1,Not so very clear,"This man is long winded and not clear on the points he makes. I prefer the more straight to the point presetation of another item carried by amazon. A little booklet called Verbal Judo, The art of Deseculating Any Difficult Situation. Which is a quick, easy read."
1,I can't get myself to finish the book.....,"I was given this book to help with the way that I communicate. I really don't feel I know more now than I did before. I am still waiting to read the steps to take to help with my ""verbal judo"". I have had this book for about 6 months and I am only half done with it. I can't get myself to read any more of it. This guy tells lots of stories but little how to. There has to be a better book on the market to learn ""how to"" in communicating with people."
4,Good book,"I heard good things about this book, haven't start reading it yet. the quality of this book is ok. Give a thumb up."
2,A ... waste of my time,"As a teacher of English, speech and communication, I found very little useful information in this book. Some points were simply redundant and others held no place in educated society--[one] phrase for example were highly childish and derogatory. Additionally, Mr. Thompson's language and examples were often [biased]. It is no wonder that Mr. Thompson is no longer a teacher of English. The classroom is much safer without him."
1,DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY...,"This book was horrible. It was a waste of my time and effort to read this book. His title stated "" control the out come of every dispute..."" He didn't even talk about everyday disputes. The only thing that he talks about in this book is himself. The author shouldn't even give advice about diputes becaues he was divorsed three times. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY ..."
4,The Most Dangerous Weapon,"Thompson makes the point that the most dangerous weapon in anyone's arsenal is the cocked tongue. Dangerous to the owner, that is. We all, at one time or another, have great difficulty climbing out of holes that we have dug with our tongue.Thompson teaches a method for using the tongue as a constructive, rather than a destructive force. He sets out some simple mnemonics to guide the reader through the thorny thicket of verbal confrontation, and gives the reader a good concept of how to work toward a win/win solution.Thompson's definition of win/win is this: You get what you want, your antagonists saves face, and nobody gets hurt. The principles are easily grasped, the methods are simple and straightforward, and the objectives are praiseworthy.The philosophy of Verbal Judo is summed up in a quotation from Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"": ""To win 100 battles is not excellence; to win without fighting is excellence."""
4,"Many High Points, A Few Lows","Overall, this is a great collection of both original & traditional Christmas tunes. Highpoints include Travis's cover of Buck Owens' ""Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy"" (which is even better than the original!), the brisk ""Loving Time of Year"", & the straight blues of ""Christmas Just Ain't Christmas Without You."" He also puts a very different spin on ""Winter Wonderland"" & ""Silver Bells"", & both work extremely well. The low points come on the traditionals, ""Oh Little Town of Bethlehem"", ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day"", & ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"", all of which are extremely monotonous & drawn-out. But, in the end, it's well worth it to get to the others. (There's always the fast-forward button.)"
5,Our Favorite Christmas Album,"This is my husband's favorite Christmas album and he didn't even like country when he first heard it! It has a little of everything...a little romance, a little rock and roll, a lot of country and best of all--all the love and joy of the holiday season! ""Loving Time of the Year"" is one of the best songs about Christmas...oh I could go on and on...I just love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Noiseless, versatile and way better than your average mixer inputs","It works very well on bass! It works well on guitar too - depending on what sound you're after.I was expecting more on voice - though I need to try some more with different settings and mics. Maybe if I change the stock valves (like I've read somewhere) the sound opens up or brightens up a little more. But it's a very versatile unit, it can go from clean to almost ""crunch"".Overall, it's a very competent unit and I would buy it again; I think it's not fair to expect an expensive sound from 2 channels at this price point."
5,Much longer than the version in The Once and Future King,"This novels is written for adults, or at least for much older children than those who love the first book in the series, The Sword in the Stone. It includes some very grim scenes, particularly the slaughter of the unicorn. It is one of the great fantasy novels, and is roughly twice as long as the version edited to appear in The Once and Future King. It is the second of five books in T. H. White's classic Arthurian romance. My recommendation is to read at least the first two books in their original form, instead of the much altered version in TOAFK."
3,NOT KING KONG,ENGLAND'S ANSWER TO THE GREAT APES MOVIES. FINE FOR WHAT IT IS. BUT HOW DOES A CHIMP BECOME A GORILLA?
3,mogrilla,"Konga is the perfect example of science gone wrong. A lustful scientistdiscovers a way to make things HUGE along with his ego. He keeps his girlfriend/secretary on a leash and lusts after a younger high school girl. He then experiments with his chimpanze buddy and turns him into amoronic gorilla. With one too many mishaps, the gorilla, the girlfriend,and his lust get out of hand which leads to their destruction."
2,Absurd !,"Producer Herman Cohen -who appears briefly in the picture-wanted to call this movie "" I Was a Teenage Gorilla "" ,presumably as a genuflection to the notorious "" I Was a Teenage Werewolf "" It stars Michael Gough as a decidly loopy botanist named Dr Decker who returns from Africa with a pet chimpanzee in tow .He uses a giant serum to transform the creature into a giant gorilla and then hypnotises the ape into killing the people he hates .His live -in assistant -woodenly played by Margo Johns -gives the creature an overdose in a jealous rage and he goes on a rampage across London .The climax sees Konga -a man in a monkey suit -climbing Big Ben with Gough ( a doll verssion !) clutched in its paws .The effects are woeful , and the carnivorous plants are especially risible ; the acting apart from Gough is dreadfully dull .By Contrast Gough deliberately hams it up and gives an outrageous performance which is the sole reason the movie remains even remotely worth watchingOne for devotees of dreck"
1,King Kong meets Tarantula in a terrible B Movie rip off of Kong,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, It's been said ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is the worst movie ever made, that is not a bad movie, for 50s audience yes it was, but it had a cult following. Konga has not and probably won't, it's just awful, it's not even an entertaining B movie, it was a terrible B Movie."
4,Better than I expected,"I found ""Konga"" to be an enjoyable horror film. Michael Gough does a good job as the ruthless, conniving scientist. He's really outrageous. ""Konga"" probably did not have a large budget, hence the simple special effects. But in a strange way, they add to the charm of the picture. A nice little gem of a movie. Somewhat hammy, but fun."
5,Fantastic! Very Detailed information.,"A Must for every bike builder. So much information packed into this book. Not a light read, you need to study this book."
2,Poorly Edited Production,"The video quality of this DVD is very good.However, the sequence of the presentation is poor.The DVD starts with commentaries on Victor Hugo and Pablo Picasso rather than on Paris.Throughout the DVD the narration is out of synch with the video content.The DVD should be re-edited and a script prepared that more effectively supplements the video content."
1,OH DEAR,"Who would pay $10 for this covers CD, when you can get over 50 of Garth's Brooks' own hit recordings on his 6 CD box set ($25 at walmart.com).Some of these covers aren't bad, but some of them are are just stupid and out of tune at times. Buy the real Garth!"
2,strange,"I've only eaten one of these so far...they are covered in a strange powder and smell terrible out of the package. I had to rinse it off in the sink before eating it. It def had spice to it though. The chewyness of the candy made me wonder about the ingredients used in it. It's probably something like ground up horse hooves or some other nasty animal product.So...the flavor was alright. The smell and consistency of the candy are pretty unappetizing though, for me. I knew I was taking a risk in ordering these."
3,Ginger Candy,"It was OK ,over priced,and was not very fresh. and did not realy tast like Ginger,But I learned a lesson."
4,No Complaints,I have no complaints. This product is great for morning sickness for the pregos out there. Product came on time and in good condition.
2,Ting Ting Jahe Ginger Candy,"Ting Ting Jahe Ginger Candy is a nice gift, but I would not buy it for me because I don't like ginger."
5,A good buy on a great product!,"If you have ever purchased ""Ginger Chews"" and paid quite a bit for a small tin, then you will be thrilled you found the original Asian product. It is so much cheaper! Exact same product, different wrapper!The candy itself is wonderful...very chewy and spicy. It will wake you up better than a cup of coffee, makes a sore throat feel better and also helps an upset tummy! And, if you are feeling fine, it just tastes good! If you like spicy heat and chewy texture, try this great candy out."
5,Perfect for nausea and other problems like morning sickness...,"I have used ""Ting Ting Jahe Ginger Candy"" for over a year now because it helps me with nausea. I have chronic pain and have to take strong narcotic medicine which makes me very nauseated. Even though this is in a candy form, it works and it also has a great taste and is chewy. I recommend this to anyone who has motion sickness, morning sickness, nausea or an upset stomach. I don't know what I would do without it, plus you can get it at a very good price on here."
5,Bluebirds,This is the best book I found on bluebirds. I shared it with the neighbor who modified his houses: bluebirds left my place and went to his!!
4,blue birds,I wanted to learn more about this and I did and also wanted to have for reference book I got all of this and more . I wish the photos were in color but that's not anyone's fault.
4,For newcomers to the bluebird trails.,"This book is great for newcomers who want to have bluebirds nesting near enough to watch. I have seen 2 hatchlings,fledge, and take to the big world and it has been facinating."
5,"Strong defense against ""Perseverance of the Saints.""",Theologians of all stripes would do well to interact with Dillow's work. The doctrine of rewards at the Bema is defended exegetically while the problems in both Calvinism and Arminianism are highlighted. Definately a must-read.
4,Good for a great value!,My grandparents love caviar so I bought this hoping it would be good. We were all pleasantly surprised. I would order this product again.
4,Capelin Caviar,"Tasty caviar, very small bead but with an excellent mild flavor. Goes great with about anything, and it's quite addictive - Cold Smoked Salmon and Cream Chesse with this are really good - And for the price, you can eat all you want - 4 3.5oz jars, a product of Iceland - Refrigerate well before using -"
4,Great value for the novice,"My husband has always wanted to try caviar and has asked repeatedly for me to order some as we don't get out much, plus we live in a small town and have never seen it available at restaurants here. I ordered this one due to the affordability and good reviews and was not disappointed. He has asked me to order two more boxes of 4, so he must have liked it."
1,Mush,"I served per directions. At first the eggs were fine. Towards the half-way point, they had mostly been squashed. Just a black salty goo... Avoid."
2,Just Okay,"Food coloring was a turn off. when put on bread or butter green was visible. EWW.I fed it to the guests, couldn't stomach eating it myself. Pay a bit more and get decent caviar.Wouldn't buy again."
3,SALT,"I found the caviar, or rather fish eggs, to have a smooth, deep flavor. But it had a ton of salt in it. I've been eating caviar of all kinds, especially the types, like yours, I can afford, for 48 years (since I was 10) and never had a saltier caviar. Cut DOWN on the salt, please. You will you have a better product. I am still trying to think up ways of diluting the salt taste. Crackers, eggs, etc. David P. McClellan"
4,"taste was pretty good for the price, but the caviar was very small","I read the reviews and I thought, eh, give it a try--I bought it as a gift for someone who eats caviar regularly. This would probably be good for someone who is not that familiar with caviar. I was told that the flavor was okay and the eggs were very very small. It's a good value for the price but I should have known to get better."
4,caviar,"The caviar was very good with a mild taste and popped as you ate it,I would buy this product again without any problem."
4,Really great price and yummy!,"this is a very mild, good caviar! I was kind of hoping it would have been a bit stronger flavored but it was very good and had tiny crunch. great on cucumber slices... mmmm :)I would order this again or sure, plus you cant beat the price! Very pleased overall"
5,Delicious.,"This caviar is on the smaller side, and is quite tasty. Since the price isn't too high, we don't feel guilty spreading generous portions of it over buttered toast! Give it a try, you'll thank Amazon you did."
3,Grocery Store Caviar,"This caviar arrives, via Priority Mail from the USPS, not on ice but vacuum sealed in a set of four glass jars. I immediately put it into the fridge for a later date, which was today.The caviar is of the very small variety and did, despite not arriving chilled, maintain a mild crunch. The taste is over-salted, and a glance at the ingredients explains why. 620mg of sodium X 4 servings in one tiny jar of 3.5 oz. So 2480mg of sodium total. And the poor list of ingredients doesn't stop there. There is a stabilizer added, a preservative added, and three food colorings added. You may as well go to the grocery store and buy off the shelf rather than have this sent to you. I won't be buying it again. Please see my other review of a very fine salmon roe that arrives shipped overnight for free with ice packs. That same company also offers a delightful whitefish caviar that ships in the same manner and is very reasonable."
4,OK Caviar,"I am not a caviar expert. I've had the really, really good stuff and this is not it... but its not bad. I have purchased the grocery store type for garnish or parties. This in contrast is a finer texture with OK flavor. I would purchase again if I needed a lot as its cheaper. To treat myself I'd go back to the grocery store brand. I just like the texture of larger eggs better. However these jars are wonderful. As an artist I'm always on the lookout for small wide mouth jars - perfect."
3,Ingredient not listed.,"I bought them becasue price is good and didn't see ingredients in product description, so I assume that they are caviar and salt. Turns out it has food coloring. Our family do not eat food coloring, so it is a big minus to us. We ended up having to give them away. I am sure we will enjoy it very much if there was not unatural additives. We give three stars becasue we don't want to be unfair to the vendor. If they list more details, customers can decide better for themselves. Thank you."
5,Kill I Oughta Rocks!,"Sure it might not be like L.D. 50, TEOATTC, or Lost & Found. But Mudvayne did tremendous work with this masterpiece! But to tell you the truth, I found this album to be much more heavier then L.D. even if Ryan wasn't envolved back then. Even though, this great album was supposed to be released in 1997, but who cares, Kill I Ougtha or whatever you pronounce it is a must have for Mudvayne fans! But now, its called TBOATTE now with its released in 2001 & it rocks, you guys won't be disappointed, especially hardcore Mudvayne heads! I have all 4 of their albums, & I'll be glad if they'll make a 5th album soon in 2007!"
5,Great cd,"Ok, this is not L.D. 50, if thats what your looking for, go elsewhere. But this cd still rules, its really heavy and really good. The last 3 songs are kinda crappy, but the rest of the songs are great. I had never heard 'Kill I Oughta' before, so this cd was all new for me and it serves up as a great hold over album untill their next album coming out pretty soon (Im writing this review in October of 2002). So this a great album except for the last couple songs."
3,Pretty cool Mudvayne,"Okay don't compare this to L.D 50 cause this was way before that. anyways Songs you should really listen to are Idiot, Central Disposal, Coal, Seed and Fear. The rest aren't really that good. But I'm aguy that likes ALL kinds of music and when I listened to the DIG remixes it was so cool they are almost like a club dance version of dig especially the first remix it's pretty cool. It's a very good buy go for if not for they're old stuff for the remixes of Dig cause they're awesome Fear and Idiot are real good."
3,Solid hold-over till next album.,"If you're a hard-core Mudvayne fan than you'll love this album. If you're expecting another L.D. 50 then you may be disappointed.As a cleaned up version of their self released ""Kill, I Oughta"" it devlivers with solid songs and its pretty heavy. However the rhythym section is alot more straight-ahead than that of LD50. Sound quality varies on some tracks, from pretty good to mediocre. IMO the remixes of Dig are lame. When you replace the best rhythym section in metal with drum machines and disco beats its NOT a good thing."
2,Not your typical Mudvayne,I bought this cd expecting to hear some Mudvayne that isn't on the're other couple cds that would be just as good as there other cds. I was wrong. Its really amature and not the typical Mudvayne sound your used to. I agree that track 10 the dig remix is pretty good. Eventhough I have that remix on a compilation cd I think its on the Valentine Soundtrack
2,Ryan made them a better band,"Only for the complete Mudvayne fan who wants Kill I Oughta, this CD is just average. Nothing great, nothing terrible either. But it is missing Ryan on Bass, so that could account for a lot."
2,Hardcore Fans ONLY,"This album was released a while after Mudvayne's ""L.D. 50"" came out, and being a fan of that album, I decided to buy this. As I'm sure you know by now, it's a re-release of their indie debut album ""Kill, I Oughtta"".The music on this album is not as dynamic as on ""L.D. 50"" or anywhere near ""The End of All Things to Come"". The lyrics are good, but again, not as good as on the other two releases, nor are the vocals. Most the tracks are pretty heavy, with very aggressive and emotional singing, but there's just an overall lack of amazing tracks. My favorites are ""Seed"" and ""Cultivate"" and the rest just kind of sink. The remixes of ""Dig"" aren't really that good either. One's too techno-ish and both are way too long.As I said in the title of this review, I recommend this album to hardcore fans only. If you want the best Mudvayne album, check out their newest. This should be last."
4,Loved it,great album if you like mudvayne otherwise i doubt that you will like it. i heard it before i bought it and am happy with it.
5,MUDVAYNE ROCKS THE JOINT OVER & OVER AGAIN!!!!,"Ever since L.D. 50 has been released, I was pleased that Mudvaynes 2nd album TBOATTE was to be released in 2001 already, but who cares, I picked it up & liked it already. Two remixes of ""Dig"" were awesome. It formely was named Kill I Outa & it originally was the first Mudvayne album that Ryan wasn't involved in Mudvayne back then. Some people rate this below but I think this is one of their best albums along with L.D. 50. Try this album out people &or Mudvayne fans, you won't regret this taste of Mudvayne music, I KNOW.p.s. It was supposed to be released in 1997, just to let you Mudvayne fans know thats all."
2,Buy L.D.50,"I would stick to their recent work...this album is unpolished and unimpressive. Only for die-hard fans who must own everything Mudvayne. 2 stars only because of the Dig remixes tagged onto the end, but you can find those on other compilation albums so I'd stay away from this one. Sorry to dissapoint."
2,For completists only,"Released after the major label debut of ""L.D. 50"", Mudvayne's ""The Beginning of All Things to End"" collects the band's independent EP ""Kill I Oughta"" plus some bonuses. Let me start off by saying that I thought (and still believe) that ""L.D. 50"" was some of the absolute worst music to ever be heard in the genre. However, Mudvayne appears to get better with each passing album, and this disc comprises the good and the bad of the band. Opening track ""Poop Loser"" begins powerfully enough, but fades rather quickly, while the needless remixes of ""Dig"" are gut churning. ""The Beginning of All Things to End"" has a few moments, but it's nothing worthwhile at all. Hardcore fans of Mudvayne who don't already own this will most likely pick it up, as it's just another chapter of supposed mainstream ""hardcore"", ""metal"", etc. for kids who can't handle the likes of Morbid Angel, Napalm Death, and such."
1,its a scheme,"what the hell. this is just a scheme for mudvayne to get money. WOW how bout we re-release our indepenant release with some remixes that take 2 seconds to remake with a switchboard! that what they were thinking before they released this... how can they have any more fans, considering they are just ripping them off?... start to think people!"
1,The worst,"After hearing Mudvayne, I have to say that a new low has been established for my music rating scale."
3,average?,"Ya know what, I don't like this one as much. I never had a chance to get ""Kill I Oughta"" because back in 1997, I had absolutely no clue who these guys were, and besides the fact that I was 10 years old. Really, what 10 year old wants to listen to Mudvayne. Anyway thats besides the point. After getting TEOATTC and L.D. 50, I loved this band. Their beginning stuff is alright, but its too... crunchy I guess... to raw. The remixes of Dig are turds, and are too long. The L.D. 50 song is interesting for maybe a few minutes, but just gets annoying. L.D. 50 is deffinately their best. enough said."
4,not the best,"i bought this cd after i got L.D. 50 and the end... but this isn't really like either of them. i can't really decide if i like it or not. after listening to their 2 full length cds, this was hard to listen to. by all means its still a good cd, its still really heavy and it still sounds like mudvayne, but its early and it shows it. after seeing mudvayne in concert, i found new apprecaition for all there music because they are so damn good at what they do."
4,Raw & Brutal...,"'The Beginning Of All...', the re-issue of Mudvayne's independant release 'Kill I Oughta', is a blend of heavy duty metal. However, this is not to say that it is in anyway in close comparison to 'L.D.50' - it's not. Unfortunately, 'The Beginning...' leaves a lot to be desired. 'Pooploser' is an anthem for angst-ridden teens. Grey's vocal projection is reminscent, again, of Johnathan Davis in the 'Follow The Leader' era. 'I.D.I.O.T.' and 'Fear' are the best tracks, but check out 'Cultivate' and the alternative versions of 'Dig'. A worthy purchase of any hardcore, die-hard Mudvayne fan."
3,Randy Travis voice grabs your heart & soul.,"There's something about Randy Travis, when he sings its like he's singing only to you. His voice seems to know just what cord inside of you needs to be touched. My husband and I listen to his cds often. Anyone who has never experienced the power of a Randy Travis song has a void in their lives, they should fill immediately. His voice can put a baby to sleep, soothe hurt feelings, open a slammed door and add romance to a beautiful night. I hope he never runs out of material."
1,MIsleading Title,"If youre looking for technical and detailed advice then do not buy this book. It should be titled ""Personal Memoirs"". I don't have the money to buy the artist that she talks about in this book. If I were considering a painting by Cassat or an etching by Braque then I would be well beyond what this book informs. If youre really a newcomer to collecting then buy a book that will teach you how to determine a paintings age by the condition of the canvas or how to distinguish a valuble lithograph. Anybody would know 90% of what this book advises."
4,Energetic and loveable,"Love My Life is an adorable story about two college students who fall in love. Ichiko, the younger, is an emotional girl who loves books and people; Eri is an aspiring lawyer with a more serious temperament. The first half of the movie explores their families and friends, while the second half is about a rift that develops between the two and how they find each other again.Love My Life is not a perfect movie. There are a few over the top moments that are difficult to believe, and some acting is a little weak. But the movie is redeemed by its incredible energy. It reminds you of how good it can be to be alive, hence the title, and how enjoyable things can be. This movie, while not life-changing, is fun and watching it makes you want to have fun, something everyone needs to be prodded into doing now and then."
2,Make use of the capabilities of the format perhaps?,"I'm not reviewing the content of the film here, just the DVD authoring. The subtitles are hard-coded onto the video stream, not on a switchable subtitle track. The US licensor/manufacturer just got the English-subtitled ""film festival"" print of this film and ripped it straight to disk. Part of the point of DVD technology was multiple switchable language tracks and subtitle streams. The manufacturer was just lazy and took the fast-track in this case. I guess getting the original print and the subtitle script and doing it properly was too much work for them. Why bother releasing it if it's going to be a half-baked attempt?Another perpetrator of this kind of laziness is Viz Media with their ""Kamikaze Girls"" US release."
5,Patty Duke Book A Winner,"This is an interesting book to read especially if you are a fan of actress Patty Duke. It does cover most of her extensive work in films, television and on stage. And, an impressive career it is indeed. It even covers Patty's years as a recording artist for United Artists Records. However, there is no photo copy of her popular album, SONGS FROM VALLEY OF THE DOLLS and this seems like a strange ommision. Other than that it is a book worth having in your own private library."
1,On top of what whale?,"This movis was so full of sub-plots that the true story never came out. I was willing for it to end. It was excrutiating long and, frankly, boring, with parts that simply did not make since. The subliminal storylines and tinted lenses did little to glorify this freakish masterpiece of medieocrity. Do your self a favor and dont waste your time on this one. And, no, there is no whale, literally or figuratively."
5,looks natural,"I've tried so many under eye concealers, and this is the best I've found. Most of them go on streaky, with no consistent coverage, but this goeson perfect. Looks like your natural skin color, and stays put. My search for the best concealer has ended."
3,Too narrow.,"It's a good product, but it is too narrow. It's sturdy and well built, but poorly designed.If you have a narrow phone, this would work well. But there are very few phones that are narrow enough to fit in this holder.If you have a smart phone you might want to look else where. I bought this as a gift to a friend who has an HTC Droid, and it's about 1/4 of an inch too narrow. The adjustable band would have been a great idea if it was designed properly. It adjusts the depth, not the width. This I find bizarre. Most phones are under an inch thick and the holder has above 1.5 inch clearance, sufficient for all phones on the market. The adjustable band increases the depth to about 3 inches... do you know of any phones that are three inches thick? I don't! It would have been better if you could adjust the width, not the depth."
1,No way,"I did not receive the "" TYPE S "" as picture shows, it is ""HIKARI""(I dont think you will expect that). Can not even fit my Blackberry Pearl 2 inch wide."
4,Wrong part for the listed year vehicles!,"Yes, this is a very nice part, well built, clean... and listed to fit the 2000 Toyota Avalon XLS, 3.0L V6.Sorry, Charlie! two inches TOO SHORT for that application!!!Doesn't fit! for that reason...What a SHAME that the part is said to be the right fit, but, it IS NOT!!!Ah, well, back to NAPA for my parts that fit, at double the price! I only service about 50 vehicles each year...and advise another 50 owners... They will ALSO be purchasing locally, instead of on Amazon.com, because, we justCANNOT afford the wait for the right parts, that genuinely do fit, and that arrive in proper condition, NOT crushed to death!"
5,A very important tool for research,"Whether you are a beginner, intermediate, or advanced, this book will help you understand many aspects of Hispanic genealogy. Language, abbreviations, paleography, jurisdictional boundaries and its effects on record keeping, etc... this is THE book to get for researching ancestors in Mexico, Central and South America, and Southern Europe.This is one of two books I recommend my classes to purchase. The other I recommend, if doing American Research, is THE SOURCE."
4,Spain and forward,"I was a bit disappointed that there was not more about locating genealogy going back from Florida, Cuba and Puerto Rico. Many of the author's suggestions are based on Mexican family research. However I have found some information useful...after all, if you don't learn something new from a book, you must be omnipotent!"
3,"Perhaps my conception of ""cool"" is different?","I appreciate that the author is writing for women who are 50 and above, and that real models are used. I can't think of the last time I saw a fashion book aimed exclusively at women in this age group. So, kudos to the author for offering advice to the 50-and-older set.But...some of the choices are just odd. I realize that I am younger and not the target audience. But eventually, I WILL be... and I don't see how it is cool to wear a serape. At least *that* serape (p. 89). Am I missing something?? Or the gigantic kimono-style top that is supposed to have an elegant shape (p. 125). Eek. There is some good advice here. But I'd have to agree with many of the reviewers that sometimes the ""after"" is just as bad as the ""before."" And some of the ""afters"" are terribly unflattering and/or just plain scary."
3,"Pretty Good, But ....","Initially I thought this was a great book. However, if an over 50 woman DOES happen to need orthodics or glasses, this author makes fun of you. She seems to have a thing for lime greens, which may not suit a lot of people. She also may have made the heavier models more stylish, but they also often look much heavier when she's done-especially in the ponchos! There is a lot of dead space -the book could have given more written hints and tips, instead there are a lot of pages with geometric colors that have nothing to do with anything. I still give it a 3 because there are many valid hints in the pictures and text, but you have to look for them & be selective!"
2,Disappointed,"As much as I looked forward to reading this book, it provided little or no inspiration. Living in south Florida, the clothing was about as appropriate as an L. L. Bean catalog. Acceptable styles and colors vary by region.At any rate, the theme of this book is a great idea with so many aging baby boomers. I was looking for a little more pizazz!"
1,disappointed,Total disappointment. Book is outdated. Not very chic. I'll stick to the magazines. Do you want to buy the book back?
1,It's a great book if you are 80 and over,"This is a great book for the ageless grandma and grandpa. There are some great pictures but no clue to where to buy them other than a general store listing in the back of the book.A much better book to pick up is ""How not to look old"" by Charla Krupp."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I didn't even bother reading this one. I ordered it over the internet so I had no way to preview it beforehand. As I browsed thru the book I quickly realized this book was worthless. The photos of ""how not to dress"" were completely rediculous. And I'd consider even some of the ""how to dress"" as frumpy and outlandish. There are better books out there on fashion, so keep looking."
2,Get rid of the glasses,"I bought this book but should have listened to my gut feeling...look at the picture of the ""Forever Cool"" Ms Mathiesonon the cover. She keeps saying GET RID OF THE GLASSES in the ""before"" pictures but she should take her own advice.The before pictures of women are so bad that ""duh"" the after pictures do look better. However the over-all impression is that the book ""teaches"" you how to dress so you blend in in suberbia, not how to be individually stylish or dress to look like anything except someone with a credit card who went to the local shopping mall and bought whatever was socially acceptable."
2,Cool is too Hot for Texas,"The pictures are fun to look at but just about all the ""Cool"" looks involved the layering of clothing.....which is very impractical if you happen to live in South Texas or Florida. By and large,the book hasn't much value in hot weather climates."
1,A big disappointment,"I didn't find the fashions in this book very cool at all. Most were unflattering, the clothes were shapeless, and not very attractive. Too many large, loose, baggy clothes. The clothes all looked at least one or two sizes too big for most of the models. Many women over 50 keep themselves in great shape and don't need to camoflauge their figures. One older woman was shown in huge, tent-like clothes throughout the book. Some of the ""dressy"" outfits were matronly looking and not dressy at all. Definitely not cool! Not worth the money."
2,"If you are a 60, short, and plump woman, skip this book","After reading some of the reviews I decided to check it out of the library rather than buy. Just spent half an hour flipping through pages. Waste of money in my opinion.Being 60, short, and plump, I only saw one or two styles in here that would work for me. It was mostly photos - on the left a frowning model, on the right a smiling one. If they had made them both smiling and left off the labels, I bet a lot of people would prefer the style on the left (the supposedly bad style). Yeah, a lot of the styles on the left were dated but a lot of smily styles looked just as boring or bizarre to me.Still waiting for a good style book specifically for older women."
1,How to Look Old is What This Should Be Called,"I'm 41 and I haven't thought about fashion in years. I've recently been inspired to care about clothes and makeup again but I found myself in an interesting situation. I found certain things that I liked and wondered ""Am I too old to wear that?"" So, I picked up this book and ""The Grown Up Girl's Guide to Style.""I think Mathieson had the right idea but really? Her ideas of cool still look old to me. Perhaps it's because, though she mentions women in their 40s here and there, all of the models were 50 and older. Even still, some of the clothes looked way too ""Golden Girls"" for my taste. There is no reason a woman needs to wear gauzy, drapy clothes that hide her every feature just because she's Of a Certain Age.I've decided that if I have to ask if it's too young, it probably is."
4,basic advice,"The book has good basic advice, but could use more specifics. Good list of buying sources. Includes tips for men, which most books of its type doesn't."
3,So-so,"While I did pick up a few things I didn't realize were ""un-cool,"" for the most part I was disappointed in this book. The ""before and after"" photos left a lot to be desired. In one instance, Mathieson points out the old fashioned hair style of the ""before"" photo then comments about the updated hair style in the ""after."" They look the same to me. Maybe the colors didn't photograph or print well, but in a couple of instances she used a particular color in the ""before"" picture saying it's a no-no; later an ""after"" photo would show what appeared to be the same color, only this time ""cool."" If it was supposed to have been in context with other things the models were wearing, it did not say so.All in all, I get better fashion advice from my daughter-in-law."
2,Not worth purchase.,"Was excited to find this book but after reading realized I could have gone to a mall or other large gathering place, looked around, figured on my own what worked on who and why, and saved the money. That being said, maybe the book was worth the price as I now know to save my money next time and look for the most logical answer, not just the easiest."
3,Some good advice - some personal opinions,"While the author does a good job with most of this book, use your head before taking all her advice. She has something against pink, pastels, jewel tones, and white shoes. Yes, some colors look bad on some people, but it isn't age, its their skin tones and hair color. One of the most beautiful, older women I've ever knew looked wonderful in pink and we all admired her young spirit for wearing color when others her age only wore blacks, greys, and blues. (This was 60's & 70's era.) White shoes are the same, they can age you badly, but a snappy pair of pumps or sandels can make an outfit. The great thing about this book is the real people models which make it easier to study what looks good, what looks bad, and why."
2,I was disappointed,"This book is full of pictures, but lacks much explanation, and has virtually no recommendations on brands/colors/etc. Greatest emphasis is on clothes. Next year when styles are different, it won't be relevant, anyway. I won't keep this book. Not nearly as good as ""How Not To Look Old"" by Charla Krupp."
2,Not worth it on Kindle,"I never worked so hard to read a book so unrewarding! I could not see the pictures well on my kindle; details were lost, the text accompanying the photographs was impossibly small and would not respond to the command for bigger fonts; finally I had to use a magnifying glass. I'm sure the pictures would not be a problem in the book format. I questioned some of the author's choices of examples and was turned off by the often condescending voice. I did not like it."
2,"Save your $$$, watch ""What Not To Wear""","Very disappointed! Most of the womens' ""afters,"" look dumpy, only less dumpy than their ""befores."" But just seeing the models who are around my age (57), I feel a heck of a lot better, so maybe it wasn't a total waste.Surprisingly, the men's section is much better - Mathieson makes the older men look much cooler in their ""afters"". So my advice is to watch WNTW and use your hard-earned money to buy Charla Krupp's ""How Not to Look Old."" Worth every cent...and more. Take it shopping with you!"
4,Okay but not the best.,"I liked this book, but I think the whole ""secret"" thing went on to long. I really liked the characters and plot. Overall a good book. I do reccommend it but not highly. But I will most likely read more books by this author :-]"
4,Tips from the Garden Hotline by Ralph Snodsmith,"Ralph Snodsmith has a down-to-earth style of writing that makes his recommendations easy to understand and apply. While being practical and realistic in problem-solving, his emphasis is on solutions to gardening questions which are basic, natural, and simple. His wealth of knowledge is evident, and it is based on his own experience, with both gardens and indoor plants. While the size of this book does not allow it to be entirely comprehensive on such a large subject, it not only makes for entertaining and educational reading, but is an often helpful resource for one's gardening questions as well."
3,Creepy just as I like it!,"I loved Twin Peaks when it was on television. I think I bought this and the television soundtrack because I loved the sound and the music so much. It is fitting that I write this before Halloween. Twin Peaks USA is a unique fictional town where the inhabitants are strange creatures themselves like the log lady among the others. Anyway, the sound here for the film is similar to the soundtrack. I like the sound and think it's appropriate for Halloween."
3,Warriors of the Lord,A solid purchase for any fan or follower of the Military Orders of the Crusades. This one doesn't dig too deeply into any of the Orders but gives the reader a compas heading as to what they were about.Fun read!
4,Not what I expected,"The book is great for what it is: a highly illustrated survey of militant religious orders in coffeee-table-book format. I did not know this when I purchased it, so was a bit let down. I was after a serious treatment of the subject. For what it is, it's great!"
5,Well worth buying,"This book is a wonderful toolbox for all kinds of applique, both by hand and by machine. The instructions and photos are clear, and the book is well-organized. The practice projects are even attractive. This is an excellent reference for a textile-work library."
2,Not the beginner book promised,"This book has lots of lovely pictures and what look like complete directions. BUT I bought this book because the reviews all said what a great book it was for beginners. As a beginner I have to say that there are *so* many details missing that I do not find that it gives me what I need to actually start applique work. I wish it did!I am disappointed, although once I actually figure out what I am doing with applique work, maybe I will find it a valuable resource. In the mean time, I am still looking for a good starter book."
5,Best applique book I have ever found!,I use this book to help me teach applique. I have never found a better book that has as many different methods of applique demonstrated in such a useful way. You can't go wrong buying this one!
2,Not as pictured,"I am in a quandary as to the number of stars to give this item. Please realize my rating is based on a very personal reason. The only thing ""wrong"" with the watch (Bulova Women's 97M52 Emeritus Bracelet Watch) is the photograph. The numbers appear to be dark or black, but the watch I received has gold numerals on a gold background and I found it hard to read. Otherwise, the watch is fine although the band quality is not up to other Bulova watches I've seen at this price.I just received it late Fri and will have to wait until Monday to call the company for return instructions. That's another thing I've learned with this purchase. Dealing with third party sellers does not give you the same ease of service as dealing directly with Amazon."
3,Its hard to know....,"Its hard to know if it works or not in my case.....not saying that it doesnt work....Its just hard to tell....but dont let this deter you from buying it....be swayed by other peoples reviews, not mine."
3,Some inaccuracies,"I have not read this entire book, but thank you, Amazon.com, for providing a sample of a page. This book starts to talk about how comic strips and comic books influenced science fiction movies and serials, which is a valid point. They mention, as a significant example, Captain Marvel. However, they say that it was Marvel Comics' Captain Marvel, drawn by ""Clyde"" Beck. The CM in question was actually published by Fawcett Comics and was originally drawn by Charles Clarence Beck.I hope the rest of the book does not make such blatant errors."
4,Wish I new more about him,"Excellent statesman and soldier. Not much about his personal life what people thought about him as a young man or a middle age man or the late years of his life but I think thats what he wanted. He wanted no glory just to be successful and serve a rare man. Short on personal stuff. Once, maybe ever 100 or so years a man comes along that truely makes a difference, this is one such man. We were luck to have him. You will enjoy reading this book."
4,Just the Facts Please,"This is a perfectly unobjectionable book outlining Gen. Marshall's life and military and political careers. It did strike me as being rather cursory in a number of areas and does not go very far in terms of the motivations and character of its subject. Undoubtedly this is in part because Marshall left very little in the way of written reminiscences of his own and kept a studied distance from those with whom he worked. As such, it leaves a bit to be desired as an in-depth biography. Nonetheless, it is well written, fair in its viewpoint and can be read within a couple of evenings. It is certainly a fine introduction to Marshall, but a reader looking for a comprehensive treatment of his life might well select one of the longer alternatives."
4,The Back Up Quaterback,"Kevin Taylor was the back up Qb on the warren high lions, all through out his life he backed up Ron Montgomery as Quaterback. Rob had more experiance an had more strenght an accuacy in his throw. Till one day on the first warren high football game rob was sacked an got hurt an they had to put Kevin in.For the first game kevin did well,but now that rob was hurt he had to play the rest of the season. While he was learning n everything all of a sudden it seemed that rob wanted to be his friend. Giving him pointers an helping him out.This book is good for any one who was a back up or just not good enough. This is a great book and i know young or old u would enjoy it to."
4,Exciting Football Action,"Kevin Taylor is a football player for the Warren High Lions varsity team. He has been a backup to Rob Montgomery since eighth grade and he thinks he'll never get a chance. Now as a senior, Kevin watches the season opener from the sidelines. During the third quarter of this game Rob Montgomery goes down. Can Kevin finish the season with the Lions as the starting quarterback? This is a great book for any sports fans. It is a book you just can't put down. The thrilling events that happen to Kevin keep you on the edge of your seat. You should definitely read Second Stringer as soon as possible because it is an exciting book."
1,Not Mac OS compatible,"Contrary to the product description, this is a windows only CDROM. The software may work fine, but I'll never know."
1,Not the same product,"I'm not sure if they changed the formula - or if I got a bad bottle. I've been using this stuff for about 8 years. This bottle is watery - and it ""foams up"" when I rub it between my palms, in the past its been thick. I would have returned it, but I threw out the packing slip with the box. I didn't use it right away, as I still had a little left in the old bottle.I have loved this product in the past, but think I got a bad bottle. :("
1,Hair product,"This product was not the real thing. I have used IntraKera for years and this was product was not the same consistency, color or fragrance as the original product should be. However, Amazon.com was very good about refunding me so I appreciate their efforts to make it right."
3,Love the product HATE the smell!!,"I used this product 10+ years ago and LOVED IT!! (Back in the days when spiral perms were hip) My hair now is getting dryer so I thought I would use it again (looking forward to it actually) and when I received it, it was the exact same in most respects except the nice, light smell I fondly remembered is now a strong, nasty, perfume smell. VERY disappointed in this product."
4,NIce but bad container,This set is great. I like the way the fork and spoon nest into the knife but the plastic top they are stored in is horrible. The top is cheap and the two side buttons used to close it are pretty much useless. But I would buy this again.
5,A Great Read For Combat Fighter Pilot Fans!,"One of the best fighter pilot books I've read! Lots of action, and Bob Johnson puts you right next to him in the cockpit!"
4,One of the best,"No matter what you say, the best WWII fightyer pilot memoir ever written was The Big Show, by Pierre Clostermann. That said, Johnson comes as a close competition. Written with the aid of Martin Caidin, it is a gripping book."
5,"""Scrapple To The Apple 52nd Street"" Wendy Simon","First heard the first cut on this CD, ""Take The A Train"", on a local jazz FM station. Had to order the CD to hear more. First time hearing this group and blown away by the musicianship, arrangements, tune selections. Very good material worthy of repeated listening. Recommended to all jazz lovers. Inspired me to learn more about this group and sad to say Eric Shaw, pianist/vocalist is no longer with us. Can't find other recordings by them which is frustrating, yet makes ""Scrapple"" all the more valuable in the vocal/jazz category. Wendy Simon and all of the musicians are top notch. Again, highly recommended."
4,Some more of Lucy's great ideas--a little wine and dance.,"As usual an I Love Lucy episode that doesn't disappoint. First she's frolicking in the grapes, then off to try out for Ricky's show. What a hoot."
3,Introduction to Karate,This is a good book for introducing an individual to karate. It is filled with good adivce and 1000 photos. The book is broken up into two main sections: Self-defense and sport karate. I found the self-defense section to be very useful. In his so called sport karate section he shows kata and two man routines per belt level. Tegner looks stiff in these photos. I do not recognize the style.
5,GREAT Quality,"I received the best quality book I could have expected-Even my wife was surprized at the quality. It took a little longer to arrive then I had expected, but it was worth it. I would give them a 4.85 out of 5 stars (solely because of the time it took). They were even great about answering my emails!!!"
5,music and lyric at the highest peak,"Libby titus cd is wonderful, i purchased album way back when and somehow lost it along the way- but i never forgot the singer or the songs. I purchased cd (the most expensive cd i have ever bought) but it was well worth it. Carly simon deserves a tip of the hat here as production is excellent. It is great to have libby back in my collection and i know i will enjoy it for many years to come."
1,Not Funny,"After reading Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head, which I thought had some great humor, I decided to try another Kliban book. Unfortunately this one seemed empty in comparison. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood."
4,Peppercorns add fun to martini drinks!,First had these in a specialty martini at a fine hotel lounge. These were just like the ones in the drink and add a splash of glamour and zing to a specialty cocktail.
3,Not for me,The pink peppercorns are just too big to work well in my grinder and I gave them away before i discovered that using whole peppercorns in my chillie is a wonderful thing.
2,"Fun, but not useful.","The interface is good and the concept is great, but you can't actually learn a language from this -- not even enough to get by if you're just visiting a country on vacation. You get foods and very basic yes, no, thank you, etc. For language lovers who just want to hear a bit of 51 different languages, it's fun, but if you really need to speak and understand at the most basic level I would recommend a ""Teach Yourself"" language book. Spend a month or two studying one of those and you'll actually be able to get by in a foreign country while on vacation."
2,Not Worth the Money,"It seems like a good program to get you started; when I bought the copy it didn't even work and I took the CD back twice. The program doesn't even give you spelling of the objects you are looking at. Yes, we know it's a knife, we know it's an apple, but how do you spell that? At least with the more expensive ones like Rosetta Stone you get spelling. I think people should just go to Rosetta Stone's website, request a free demo CD and just start there. It practices IMMERSION, so you won't get any hints (unless you request it), but it's a trial and error, a figure it out method. I do admit that these immersion programs don't help with sentence structures or grammar, but they can build your vocabulary.After skewing off there, I wouldn't recommend this program to anyone; it may be cheap but not worth your money."
3,p'd off,"i have this cd -rom but cannot seem to load it or use it on my laptop computer , perhaps windows vista does not support this ????"
1,Pretty Much Uselss,"I clearly feel ripped off. You get to learn a some of words "" Hello, goodbye, sorry, banana, grapes, good evening, etc and not much more"". You do not even get the 100 most used word or the Pronunciation of the alphabet, forget anything else. You can get more and better stuff off the internet for free. If I would have bought this at a garage sale for .99 cents I would say I got a great deal on some coaster."
4,"""Unforgettable Faces"", Worth Reading","I am a Family Nurse Practitioner student at Columbia University and I just wanted to let others know that I really enjoyed reading this book. I'm not quite done with it yet but it travels with me on my commute into NY on the train and I read it every chance I get. After reading the section on 'Confessions of a Smoker', especially about Mr. Svelton, I try to encourage smoking cessation to all the patients that I see during my clinical, who smoke. As a student I appreciate the style of questioning and I try to use that during my history intake. This book was recommended reading for my FNP program and I've been telling my colleagues about how great it is and I know that they will benefit from reading Unforgettable Faces also. Wishing this book great success. Let me know when the FNP author comes to NYC so that I could get her to sign my book.Thanks for sharing and writing such a wonderful book. :-)"
3,Slow Moving but Fascinating,"The suspense isn't very engrossing and the mystery doesn't yield too much of a surprise, but the concepts in the episode are worth considering.The actor that portray's Koridian does an excellent job and Bruce Hyde gets to ham it up again as the passionate, misunderstood, overeager Kevin Riley.If you can sit through the slow moving story, this is actually a fairly good episode."
4,Great DVD & great memories,"This DVD is really good and it brought back alot of memories. The quality and clarity is great, the entertainment is fantastic. This is back in time when there was quality entertainment on tv with people that are actually talented. The only complaint that I have is that these are not complete shows. For instance, in the openers, they used to have singing and/or dancing and that's not included in most of these shows. It's a real shame that they didn't release the entire show. Some of the programs do have some skits included which I think add to the show. Anyway, if you were an 80's child and you liked this show and country music, I don't think you'd be disappointed in purchasing this DVD. It's really good."
4,The Great Thief!,"Madonna is the queen of copy cat's. I love her for it though, she does it so well. She goes to the places that main stream America won't go and sometimes can't go to collect her data and then adds a few of her special touches and makes it her own before presenting it to us.With all of the hooplah about the ""Sex"" coffee table book this cd went under the radar which is too bad because it's actually pretty good. If you don't have this one you may as well get it to complete the set, the cd and the book...I know you have the book."
4,I do not have a problem with Madonna's Erotica album,"At present, Madonna's Erotica cd can be purchased edited in stores. I have listened to the edited cd, which largely means that I do not have the song, Did you do it? Except for Where life begins, all of the other songs are actually good. Some of the standout tracks include, Bye Bye Baby, Deeper and Deeper, Waiting, Thief of Hearts, Words, Rain and In this Life."
4,Her best album yet ....,"I think this is her best album yet, shadowing even Ray Of Light. Forget her SEX escapade, that was a half baked attempt at pushing buttons which resulted in a bad career move.Just listen to her bare her soul in this album (tracks like Bad Girl and In This Life), and hear her experiment in Secret Garden, Erotica and Waiting (lots of jazz, trip-hop stuffs).And if you listen close enough, you'd realise that the recording for this album is quite unique. In all her songs, her vocals are layered on the tracks several times. So you get to her a chorus of her singing. This technique wasn't employed in the rest of her other albums."
3,Collector's item,"This is the next best thing to owning the original 1992 12"" vinyl pressing, which has since been out of print and was only ever available in Europe.the records themselves are gorgeous, very thick vinyl discs. The artwork is not very good because it is a scan of the original release, so the pictures are a bit fuzzy and so is the wording.still looks presentable though, so if you can't afford the expensive out of print version, then you should get this one."
2,laughable,I remember hearing the song Erotica on the radio and laughing at it's stupidity. It almost kept me from buying the CD do to its cheese factor. I should have listened to my gut and not bought it. The only decent tracks are the Andre Betts collaborations. The rest is poorly written and executed. The exception is BADGIRL which is just poorly sung.
3,the edited version is awhole lot better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This isn't my favorite Madonna album but some of the the songs are pretty good.Deeper & Deeper- One of my favorites but the concept of the music video seemed more like it should be like a fasion show.Thief Of Hearts- Her voice was so good in this song but the lyrics are negative & full of cursing.Fever- A good dance song but I personaly liked the remix in the video betterRain- A romance ballad, it's pretty goodBad Girl- It's a good soft song like Rain, just the lyrics aren'tas goodErotica- The worst on the cd. It almost sonds like there's a part of the meledy cut from the song Jungle Boogie.In This Life- A sad song about someone who got very ill & died.Posibly suitible for a for a funaral"
1,exotic yet disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Madonna is a good artist but this has got to be her very worst album ever!!!!!Once at a cd store I must have seen atleast 6 used copies!Like her other album ""American Life"" this cd has no feeling what so ever.Even the photo shoot for this cd is disturbing.Unlike her other chart topping albums ""Music"" ""Ray Of Light""& ""Like A Virgin"".I would hate it even if it didn't have an expicit lyrics lable on it.At first I was afraid to watch the music video.If your a Madonna fan who thinks music isin't the way to express sex or don't like a soppy thik voice then this isin't worth a breath of air!!!"
1,Lame album,"This songwriting is pretty cheesy, plus Madonna can't sing. Bad songwriting and poor vocals equal lame album."
1,Sex has never been so boring.,"Mostly what drags this CD down the toilet is Madonna's paper thin voice. Her singing, if you can it that, removes any life to these songs. Her butchering of Peggy Lee's classic FEVER is the worst remake in history. DEEPER AND DEEPER sounds like a half a**ed attempt by Madonna to hold on to her eighties audience. Erotica is just silly nonsense and not worth anyones time."
4,BEATING EROTICA,"Just forget about the SEX incident. It was a big mistake; she pushed too far. But in this album Madonna recreates her well kown talent as a musician. The great songs of this record are, as it usually occurs, the ones that aren't aired by radios. Check ""Waiting"", ""Where Life Begins"" and ""Secret Garden""; you will discover that Madonna isn't only about commercial tunes."
5,Groundbreaking Album from a Treasured Artist,"I have always enjoyed Madonna's good humor, and her constant companionship, her albums and wroks enrich my daily life, as well as my imaginary worlds that I dream about. This album was a true testament of her dedication to herself, to her life. She is an incredible influence, and this album is tamer than one might think. A bit risque, but shining with integrity and value. Masterfully constructed and endlessly replayable. Thank you Madonna, for opening my eyes."
2,Is this album a metaphor for sex?,"Most sexual encounters are so so or really disappointing, just like most tracks on this album: easily forgotten and totally boring after the second round. But some sexual encounters are mind-blowing and inspire you, like very few tracks on this album. Well actually only one track: Erotica. The only track that shines in originality. Her sex-period was interesting, but not musically.....I give it two stars, but only because Erotica is on is."
1,Even Madonna hates it.,"Let's be honest here, this album is lackluster to the extreme. I have never heard such terrible club music in my life! Even Madonna is trying to forget this one was ever released. Check out her upcoming video collection which deletes several of the videos from this album. That should give you a clue to stay away from EROTICA."
5,Super album,"There is an exploration of the existential in Madonna's work now that shows a definitive maturity. I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it. Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us. It is that work that interests the rest of us."
5,Madonna at her best in the 90's,"This album gets a lot of bad press but it's Madonna's best in the 90's (definitely not the completely different, more fun, cheesy 80's Madonna we know and love) Instead it is mature, honest, and best of all, the songs all sound different without losing the theme of sexual revelation. You can definitely pick out one song from the other but they all flow together to provide a contemplative, sometimes serious (Bad Girl, Secret Garden), sometimes fun (Deeper and Deeper, Fever)album that is very impressive and immensly enjoyable. I like every song on this album which is more than I can say for other Madonna albums. ""Rain"" is one of her best songs ever, a case study in how music can affect your mood. ""Fever"" is a great, modern version of the old Peggy Lee classic. A very worthy album."
5,"Pravoooooooo, Maddona ....","really I think Madonna is a great poet and a great singer , that attracted me from lucky star ( true blue, like a virgin , bed time story , erotica , ray of light ..) to beautiful stranger ... I love Madonna's songs , and as ( young poet ) I am saying it was my red-letter day to hear you saying that about(bad girl) ... erotica is one of madonna's surprises and I believe that she knows How to treat our physical needs( erotica) as well as our romantic desires ( something to remember ) in the name of music , Madonna is my best singer...Yours .."
1,Very Boring&No Bite,For all The Fuss About this Disc it didn't Match the Hype at all.Deeper&Deeper is the Only song worth Remembering here.very bad Club Music.This Album is Very Lame.
2,Madonna- Erotica,"Wow. This album displeased me. Usually, I would have an album's taste last for a week, but I couldn't give this one a try. This album was ridiculous, mostly. There are a couple of songs that have decent beats, but I'm a lyricist, and lyric-wise, I need to rebuke this Erotica album. I expected it to be pretty good. One song had good lyrics: ""Why's It So Hard."" That's worth listening to because of its strong reasonableness and persuasive questioning about this phenomena we live in. ""Bye Bye Baby"" is for people who are breaking up, and who wants to go out with that heartache, especially if you're not under that condition of considering related departure from somebody? ""Deeper and Deeper"" had a good beat, but I need an album to stand out, and this one fleeted my attention despite what the majority rates it on Amazon. Don't buy Madonna's ""Erotica."""
1,Not worth the hype!,"Throw this album, along with her career, in the garbage! Madonna, your 15 minutes of fame are over with!!!! Good-bye!"
3,Title says is all!,"This may not be my favorite madonna album, yet I get into the mood to listen to it fairly frequently. Its got that sound that makes you want to slink around erotically. Simply put its erotic, which is not to say its dirty at all. Its a fun, but more sophisticated sounding album, provocative and intelligent. Give it a go!"
5,She'll Be Your Mistress Tonite...,"Madonna's Erotica album could only be described in one word. Breathtaking. Sensual, erotic, well thought are a few others. It will captivate your mind and make you think about subjects plaguing today's society. Sex, AIDS, drugs to mention a few. Madonna absouletly out-does herself in this modern day masterpiece."
5,Erotica is a great album,"This album is great! Highlights of this album are Erotica, Rain, and Waiting. This album has a lot of great upbeat dance tunes and some hip hop tunes. Everyone should pick up a copy!"
5,She'll Teach You How To...,"Madonna, better than ever, but a bit too much for the public, released one of her best albums. If you looking for a griddy, underground, street album, with some raunch, this is it!"
4,"Not her best, but highly underrated","OK. This is not ""Like A Prayer"", ""Ray of Light"" or ""American Life"". However, ""Erotica"" was unfairly scorned by critics. There are many exciting and very *erotic* songs on this album. Erotica, Fever, Deeper and Deeper, Bad Girl, Waiting, Thief of Heart, Rain, Words and Why's It So Hard are, in my opinion, some of the greatest Madonna songs ever.The music ranges from disco beat to underground (i.e. Waiting) to general pop. It's a nice album to own. It'll grow on you and drag you into a trance of eroticism.I highly recommend it, especially to those Madonna fans out there that don't already have it."
5,The Flowers of Evil Are In Bloom,"This is probably the best record I have ever heard - and I've heard a lot. Without getting to high brow, the most interesting thing about this album is the struggle between the Apollonian and Dionysian. In ""Erotica,"" Madonna puts on the costume of a dominatrix - ready to love you and destroy you with equal relish (much like the protagonist in Coleridge's poem ""Christabel"" ....""Secret Garden"" incorporates a piano with dance beats to create a sparkling paradise ripe with fleurs du mal. Baudelaire would be proud!"
4,"Not Bad, But Not Her Best","Although I am a die hard Madonna fan, I will admit that this is not her best album. While most of the songs are quite good there are more duds on this album I think, than on any other album she's released. Gems like ""In This Life"" and ""Words"" more than make up for some of the unnecessary lewdness that characterizes some of the songs on the album. I still recommend it, but not nearly as highly as I would ""Like A Prayer"" or ""Music"". By the way if you have the tape and are considering buying the CD for the extra track, don't do it. It's not really a song and it's not very good."
5,unique,"I think this is one of madonna's best albums. The music on this album is very different from anything she came out with before and after and anyone else as well. I think people didn't buy this album because of it's first 2 singles erotica (sex) and deeper and deeper (homosexual) and some parents probably didn't let there children buy the album cause, madonna had quite a few teen fans. Let's not foreget she also released a sex book. Madonna was one of the first ranchy artist. She spoke her mind, showed off her body, and didn't cared what people thought because she was the first cream of the crop it cause her some failures but eventually became the way of our music world today.I also think she released the wrong singles i'm not a big fan of fever, rain, and deeper and deeper.with the exception of bye bye baby this album gets good after deeper and deeper the rest is a masterpeice.best songs:bye bye babybad girlwaitingwhy is it so hardwordsin this life"
5,great album,"I was 9 around the time this album came out. I didn't own it then cause I only kept up with madonna videos that the older folks considered clean enough for me to watch. I vaguely remember deeper and deeper being on heavy rotation quite a bit though. Several years later I discovered the songs/videos for Rain, Fever, Bad Girl and decided I had to get this album so when I finally did I found it to be a combination of dance and hip hop and some r&b/adult contemporary as well. It was a musically diverse album just like any other album and the way the media was calling her a slut around the time of it's release was the fault of the sex book not the CD itself. Go listen for yourself"
5,This Is Her Best Album Ever!,The grooves this album has is fantastic!Erotica and Bad Girl are my personal favorites because thy are so stylish but the entire album is great!
4,One of the best,"""Erotica"" is probably the best Madonna album. It bridges the gap between her youthful dance pop and her current experiements with techno. The lyrics are classy in their lewdness. Try this one out along with ""The Immaculate Collection"" for the best representation of Madonna'a music."
5,Where to buy the teacher's manual?,"Hey, this is a must for student! As a student, where can you buy a teacher's manual? Of course, it is not a complete solutions manual!"
2,Don't buy this study guide,When I first bought this study guide.. I though it would help me with my study in Physics since the professor is not good at teaching the subject.. I was indeed disappointed with the study guide.. It is hard to understand just like its textbook..My advise don't buy the study guide.. unless you don't beleive me just buy it and see for yourself..
1,Not 150x,"This card is cheap but definitely not 150x, as previous post reported it should get over 20MB/s transfers. The best I got was ~6MB/s (40x) and it averaged ~4MB/s (26x). These cards are fakes, NOT 150x."
2,Product seems to be a Class 2 (13X) falsely labeled as 150X,"It's a 4GB SD card that works. But it is ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY NOT a 150X card: I've tried it on various systems and the max read rate is 2MB/s and the write rate is a little less than that. 150X cards (Class 6) are rated up to 22.5MB/sec read speed (some brands claim up to 30MB/s), which is over 11X of what I'm getting.Effectively, you're paying for a 13X (Class 2) SD Card. I'm using mine in an eBook reader, so the slower speed is fine. If you're fine getting a falsely-advertised product, then buy this one."
2,Not as fast as advertised - slow write speed,"I have a hard time believing this card really is 150x. My Canon S2 IS recognizes the card no problem and it works fine taking photos. Write speed is too slow, however, for video. Everything else seems to work fine so I don't think it's a faulty card.Update: The card's case actually fell apart, so it is now useless."
1,Does not recommend this SD Card,"I bought this card from eTech. The card is not a 4GB! It only gives you 3.67GB storage. Also, like others said, the speed is far slower than a 150X card. The Transcend 4GB 150X SD card writes much faster than the TOPRAM."
4,"The surprising ""dark"" ages.","Bought this for my grandson who is studying engineering to give him a feel for the origins of tools, building techniques and machines he will be using."
3,A very generic reading,"This book is filled with interesting facts. If you are looking a very shallow introduction to medieval technology, this book can help you as a way to read a more advance study.As allways, the Gies present a very organized book, dividing the inventions and technology according to the low or high middle ages, and making subdivisions for a better understanding of the different technologies (in clothing, in traveling, in science, in sailing, etc.)All that being said, the book is a little boring at times. Some of the inventions are shown in drawings, but this is not the case in most examples, and to imagine the machine by description only turns the book into a complicated reading, a reading that bores you from time to time."
4,An interesting introduction to medieval technology and inventions,"My middle school son is learning about medieval times and is quite interested in technology and invention, so I thought this would be a good introduction to the topic both for him and me. I ended up reading the book and referring him to areas of particular interest as the reading was a bit over his head in spots, but I found it an interesting topic and an enjoyable read."
2,Overwritten,"I have to chime in and say that I agree with a former reviewer that said the book was over-written. Terribly overwritten is what I would say, with descriptions out of control in many cases. The story itself, as mentioned, isn't bad, but it's a slog to get through the prose."
3,Not impressed,"Like the others here, I thought this book was wordy to the point of boredom. 40k books are, in my opinion, renowned for their lean writing and dynamic pacing. Green seems to do better with his short stories, but here I got the impression he was being verbose for the sake of filling pages. I do not plan on buying his next book, Iron Hands."
3,"Decent guide, but overly ""scholarly"" for the layman","I recently bought a house that's sited on an old apple orchard, so I was looking for information on apple tree pruning.On the one hand, this is a very comprehensive book, with a wealth of information I have not found elsewhere. On the other hand, it reads like a collection of academic (Agriculture Science) papers that have been bound and published as a book. For example, every chapter ends with three pages of references to other academic papers. Also, there is quite a bit of information that's only relevant to professional growers, like pruning and training trees so that they may be mechanically harvested.So, from the perspective of an ""amateur"" orchardist, while I found some useful information that I have not seen elsewhere, I had to wade through some pretty dry and sometimes irrelevant (to me) information to find it. And, this was a pretty expensive book. So only three stars."
3,"OK toy, but don't expect too much","Only reason I bought this for my 4 years old son is that he is crazy about motorcycles and racing...toy is solid 3 starts, a bit too small though (for ""realistic"" handling and turns i guess), seems to be hard plastic as my kid did not manage to destroy it yet.there are 8 or 9 different games, graphics is OK, I guess it's stuck back in the day when I was playing computer games :).you actually speed up using right handle like in real motorcycle race. turns are made by leaning on one side or another, I guess all is done by accelerometer which surprisingly works for this cheap toy.however son was bored with it after a month or so..."
2,Inexpensive with Cheap Performance,"I found this spotting scope nearly impossible to use, cheaply made with a very unstable and weak tripod. I was so disappointed with the quality that I returned it to Amazon for a refund. I gave it two stars, because someone with an enormous amount of patience might be able to get some use out of it."
1,This is not a spotting scope...,"By labeling this a spotting scope this will get a review as such. This is a horrible piece of junk. You can not see bullet holes with this beyond 30-40 yards with much clarity. And to be honest if a ""spotting scope"" that sells for around 50 bucks that cant even do that is a horrible piece of junk. If u want to use this with anything but a .50cal at 50 or more yard you can forget about it. Also don't get me started on the tripod... reference my second sentence.OK now if this was say a bird watching scope this would be great. Its compact, very light, easy to acquire your target, comes with a very nice carrying case etc... But i would think in this price point you could get something way better.Note to self for the 100th time: You Buy Cheap, You get Cheap.Hope this helps someone else."
3,Less than expected,It works ok but is lesser quality and smaller than expected. Light and about the size of a small thermos.
5,Great scope,Great scope for the price. I can see up to 70 mts. and no problems. I use it for Archery Target. The legs are a bit week but I use my own camera legs and it works great.
3,Fine within its limitations,"The optics are very good, images sharp. The little tripod it comes with is dollar-store junk, not nearly stable enough for a 20x scope. With a decent tripod, a nice scope...your eye must eb right up to the lens to see much of the full field. It is hard to aim and find the thing you are looking for as it would be in any 20x small scope. I put some aiming marks on the barrel to allow approximate aiming which makes it usable. Forget handholding it, too shaky."
5,Alpen Spotting Scope #711 20X50,"I bought this scope to use at the 50 yard pistol range. Its size and power is ideal for this. The scope is very clear. The only neg. thing about it is the very cheap tripod, but for the cost it is a sleeper scope and it fits my needs very well."
5,"Leapers UTG Max Strength Picatinny Rings, 2pc, 30mm, Low Profile, RG2W3104","GREAT HAND HELD SPOTTING SCOPE FOR THE MONEY, i THINK THIS WILL COME IN HANDY TO ASSURE TARGET AQUISITION. THAMNKS"
3,Lo Price and Low Ability perfectly matched.,"The scope is what it is for $49. A scope that is 20x60x60 (zoom) is really the bare minimum needed for any spotting scope. I would suggest spending the money on the more powerful, versitile scope."
5,Good buy,"I purchased this as a entry level scope and am very pleased with its quality and function. I am sure you can buy far better for far more money, but for entry level it can't be beat."
2,Pros and cons,"This spotting scope is cheap, but feels quality made. There are pros and cons.PROSLow priceSturdy constructionSmall size (I keep mine in my range bag 24/7 no issue)Decent range/focusCONSAlmost ZERO eye relief. My eyelid does touch the glass when I look through it in order to get ANY light whatsoeverFocus is on the eye piece itself. So in order for me to focus, I need to twist the eye piece which litterally twists my eye lids. Very uncomfortable.Because of this I rate it so low. It just doesn't get light in at all and if I use the glare shield it completely eliminates any light. It's only good for about 75 yards or less, too, due to magnification. IMO, it's better than nothing but I'd much rather spend my money on something with eye relief or that's longer range, or both."
3,small and limited,I bought this scope because it is very small and because of the good reviews that it got. It is very small and it is easy to pack. The problem is that the magnification is weak and the field of view is limited. I took it to the range and tried to use it to sight in a 223 rifle. I could barely see the bullet holes. I ended up borrowing the spotting scope of the person next to me at the range. I have to say that I am disappointed. I will probably buy a more powerful scope with an upturned eye piece. This is a nice toy and it is very small but it is not a good spotting scope.
2,Alpen 20 x 50 mini spotting scope,Bottom Line: I have 20/20 vision and I had alot of trouble seeing target hits at 100 yards with this scope using .223 rifle. At 50 yards it was acceptable and I could clearly see bullet holes. Other problems include very poor eye relief and focusing as well. This scope will give you tired eyes and a headache so spend another 30 or so dollars and get a larger more manageable scope.
4,Mostly good,"First, I'll tell you what isn't good:Like others have said, the tripod is crap. Loose legs and not a wide enough footprint to be stable. I used my old collapsible camera tripod. 1000% better.The lens caps are too loose.Now the good:The magnification is great.Images are clear.Focus is easy.Decent enough storage pouch.Lightweight and fits in a compartment of my range bag.It served me well sighting in two firearms."
5,Great Product,The Alpen 20x50 Waterproof Mini-Spotting Scope is great/quality product for a first time user like me. My advice for any user is please have patient with it and gentle tune the scope.
4,Just what i needed,This is a very nice usable scope. It is compact and easy to use. I have used it on bright days and overcast days and still been able to see the holes on the target at 50 and 100 yards. I did go ahead and replace the tripod though with this one -Pedco UltraPod II Lightweight Camera Tripod. The new mini tripod is great. The Alpen spotting scope works great on my full size tripod also. I would not hesitate to purchase this product if you are looking for a decently price scope that performs well. If you are expecting to see the hairs on a gnats behind purchase something else... The no zoom should be address but for the price and performance i am very glad i bought this. I would and have recommended this scope to others...
3,You get What You Pay For,I bought this item as a spotting scope at the shooting range. It is hard to see your shots at 100+ yards. The field of view is also VERY limited. The stand that comes with it also cheaply built and does not offer much more than spot to hold your scope as the adjustments shift in between shots.
3,Tips over easily,I bought this scope in late October 2010. It has a reasonably sharp image but the mounting stand is too narrow for the scope's size and easily tips over.
1,Garbage!!!,"I didn't expect much from this scope Considering the price but I at least expected something that could handle a 2"" drop. Dropped on its side from literally 2"" and stopped working. Don't buy this!!!"
4,The baby boomers way to relax in the pool,"Being born in 1946, I find it preferable to relax in the pool in a sitting position, not laying down. This float accomplishes that. You stay cool and wet, yet you have the opportunity to chat with other since you are in a sitting position."
5,SunSeat,The SunSeat is fantastic -folds up to be packed in the suitcase - does not weigh much - you can sit for hours in the sunseat and float around in the lazy river or pool - just sit back and relax or read. I love it!!
5,great book!,"That's a great book about the Dreamer, the Dark Queen, and others.A book filled with Magic and Power._______________________Can't wait for the next one!"
4,"Good mix of magic, techonology, and chivalry","This book shows that it isn't just brute strength that will win the day. It's also knowledge, and the ways you apply that knowledge. Interesting way to look at the effect of technology on a (more or less) medeival society. Also interesting to see how magic and technology work together. All in all a great read, I can't wait to get the next one. The only reason I give this book 4 stars not 5 is that it depends on the next book too much. The ending is left entirely too open."
5,Eargasm,"Producer/songwriter Stick who used to work with H-Town and Ideal has formed band O'Flava Psi. If you like H-Town and Link, this is the same kind of sexy soul, aimed to please your ears. Great vocals, good tunes, flawless production. A good mix of some Snoopy-ish hip-hop tracks and some slow old school ballads. ""Ain't No High"" partly borrows its hook from Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"", but stands strong in its own right as one of the best out of my good tunes. ...."
5,Very Interesting & Informative,"The movie gives a lot of insight into our freedoms and lack there of. It is a politically charged movie but unlike the 1 star review implies, I do not see it as merely left or right as we see democrats shown in the role of large business money baggers as well. The important issue is are the facts presented true?The disturbing answer is not only easy to find.Case in point is another fantastic movie called Orwell Rolls In His Grave. I had the good fortune of watching it a couple years back. It not only shows the parent company of the parent company of each available media outlet, it also names names of who is on the board of directors of each company. Coincidentally many of the same names appear on each, even the ones considered ""competitors"". Also coincidentally, is that the movie is no longer available through Netflix or Amazon !!!"
3,Chemical Brothers hat,"The shipping went well I got the product right away. The quality of the hat wasn't quite what I would've liked (cheap material), but overall I'm satisfied with the product."
3,Too expensive to have enough pieces to play with,"We own two Automoblox (blue sedan and green truck) and while they are well made and nice cars to play with the idea of pulling them apart and building new cars is extremely limited with only two. The price is a serious limit on how many we can afford and two cars just doesn't create much variety.Also, you can't just pull the end off one and place on on another -- the interior connector has to be switched out, which is too tricky for 5 year old fingers. The documentation says ""this offers a welcome level of complexity"" but I think it just makes it needlessly difficult."
1,Quality and Safety Problems. Too Expensive.,"These sounded and looked like good ideas but the quality control/design of the plastic connectors are so poor that if your child is rough on them or steps on them, the eventually work loose and come apart, exposing sharp metal screw points. Poor construction quality from China or poor engineering design or both. We purchased three and they have all fallen apart at the connector junctions. I had one replaced by the company but same end result. NOT RECOMMENDED unless you plan to be very gentle with these."
1,Yikes!,I found this book to be poorly-written and lacking in insight. Note that the author had to have it published herself. No reputable house would put out something like this.
3,From a fiction reader,"Feelings, pain, joy are apparent. However, I wanted more direction from the author. Nonetheless, if you are into new-age literature, you'll probably enjoy it. A provocative work."
4,Great pure intertainment,"We need movies like these in this day and time for the children (and adults).....how much better our lives would be....yes, this was an excellent buy......thank you"
3,It's ok was looking for later years as a little girl,"Had no plots, just child play. Couldn't make any sense out of it. I was looking for more like the good ship lollipop and the colonels daughter"
3,would still like to view vol. 1,"I so wanted to view thes with my great niece and nephews. I was previewing them to make sure all was in working order. It was not. The volumn 2 was great and played all the way through without any problems;however, the volumn 1 never did start. I cleaned my machine, wiped the disk with a soft cloth reinserted several times and then I held it up to the light and to my astonishment I think there is nothing on the disk at all. no imprinting grooves are there. the price is so low on this one I am tempted to buy another one just to see if I can get volumn 1, but I am afraid that a second one may have the same issues."
1,Terrible,I watched Shirley Temple when I was young I don't ever remember seeing movies like this. Maybe it was before my time. I am 50 years old. My 4 year old daughter is learning tap. I thought she would be encouraged by another small girl performing so well. Less than one minute of any dancing. There were so many children scantily dressed in those movies. I believe this was the early version of child porn. I would not let my daughter watch the early movies at all. We were purchasing the movies strictly to watch her tap dancing technique.
1,Not what I expected,"I was expecting her movies, but these are just short shows with little kids trying to act like adults. Being a conservative person, I was surprised at the content. I don't think kids should be flirtacious and having scenes in bars. Some of it was downright offensive which shocked me."
5,The very best book about Innovation and CAE Management,I am a CAE (computer-aided engineering) manager at a major automotive company. This book really opened my eyes! It not only captures the daily challenges we have in managing our technology but also provides a blueprint for getting CAE/CAD systems integrated into R&D processes. I believe if we followed Thomke's advise we could get a lot more out of the hundreds of millions of dollars that we invested in our systems. This book should be required reading for all (R&D) managers and engineers!
5,Perfect for the pear shaped face,"Sunglasses have always been very tricky for me-- I have somewhat pear shaped face, so finding a pair of glasses/sunglasses that fit correctly and complement my face type has always been a struggle. I had never tried these on, but after reading the reviews saying that they are ideal for medium to large sized heads, I decided to order some for myself.Fantastic! These glasses are wide enough that the lenses wrap around to the temple, balancing my more pronounced cheek and jawline. They fit snugly, without being uncomfortable, and look very sharp.Optical clarity is very good and the price is just right."
5,AMazing,first of all i love how these sunglasses fit on me and how these look. The case for these sunglasses are just awsome that come with
5,Great value; fast and easy.,"Lost my original Bolles that I had found on sale at military PX. Came to Amazon after many days of searching best price; I shoulda started at Amazon. Order placed and shipped within days. Best part was these new sunglasses were, in the end, even far cheaper than those purchased ""on sale"" at the PX... Great job; will be back when I lose this new pair!"
2,Average Sunglass's,"Quality is OK, not great.Negative: As with a lot of Sunglass's they pinch at the very ends behind the ears.Positive: They are sturdy and light."
4,great specs,"nice fit and optics. After about 9 months I got a small scratch on the lens so I don't expect these to last too long. I do like the ligher weight than glass lenses but expect to replace them a lot sooner than you would a quality glass lens sunglass like Vuarnet,"
4,"good glasses, good value","Love my Bolle Anacondas. Just bought another pair after my first ones were knocked off my head in a whitewater rafting mishap. Clear polarized lenses, great for water activities, but I also play golf in them and wear them driving. They fit my head well, and I have a larger than normal noggin. About 1/2 the cost of the Ray Bans that I was wearing before."
5,Bolle Sunglasses are great,"Stylish, like the color, sturdy, and very good unobstructed peripheral views.A good buy when compared to Maui Jim. I'd this item again."
3,"Awesome glasses, nose rubber wears off overtime","Great glasses, the one comment I have is that the rubber nose pads wear off over time and fall off. I would recommend that the company tries a new plastic."
2,Cheap Sunglasses,Pricey glasses w cheap quality. Would not buy again. Lens scratch easily and lens pops out when you clean them.
4,I'm happy with the product,I'm happy with the product but they do have an odd effect on glare or computer screens. Never the less I wear them all the time.
2,No what I exected for the money - returned,"I thought I would try buying a better/more expensive pair of sunglasses after going through a few cheap pairs this year. I had a pair of RayBans a few years ago until I lost them on a trip.... having them for about 2 1/2 years..I read all the reviews, so I gave these a try. I was very disappointed when I received them. It wasn't because the colors were much lighter & brown than in the picture. It was the feel and construction. The glasses felt much like a cheaper $20 pair. They were light, felt like hey would break without much of an effort. The lenses felt plasticky... to make a word.I decided to send them back the first day."
1,Fell apart after three months! Stay away!,"The quality of these sunglasses is absolutely the WORST that I have ever experienced. After having them for only three months, the soft rubber on the earpieces and nose began to melt, yes, melt, and then completely fall off! My glasses had a tortoiseshell finish, and the finish also began to melt and slowly peel off. Incredible! I could see this happening with cheap sunglasses, but not with a pair costing $90. I ended up contacting the US distributor (Baush & Lomb), who promptly sent me a replacement pair, and guess what? The exact same thing happened to those too! At one time, the Bolle name meant quality. But now, it represents expensive garbage. I am frankly quite amazed that other customers who purchased these sunglasses have not experienced the same problems that I have. Bottom line: I would strongly suggest to anyone who is considering purchasing these sunglasses to NOT BUY THEM!"
3,NOT GREAT,DIDN'T LOVE THE STYLE OF THE GLASSES BUT THEY ARRIVED IN A TIMELY FASHION AND COME WITH A PRETTY NICE CASE
5,Bolle Sport Sunglasses,I love my new Bolle tortoise/polarized sunglasses. They fit very well and being polarized is a must have for me.
4,pretty darn good,i am a lifeguard and needed some shades for work. i took a risk buying them on line but i am glad i did. they are comfortable and light weight. i think they are pretty stylish too. i am not sure if they are polarized though. however they work well and keep my eyes from getting tired. because they are light they also feel a little breakable but so far they have been great. these are good glasses and i am satisfied with my purchase.
4,Great Shades for a Decent Price.,A very good pair of polarized sun glasses that have done their job in the bright Afghanistan sun. Comfortable and easy on the temples and ears. The only negative aspect of the glasses are that one's eyelids touch the lenses at times. The polarized lenses don't leave your eyes tired after being out in the sun all day.
2,Ok..but...,"While I love, love, love the shape and design of these glasses, I am through with them. This makes by 5th pair and all of them have suffered from different things. The lenses get scratched easily. How easily?? Let's just say that if you ever use anything other than they enclosed microfiber cloth, you run the risk of scratching them or better yet, like my last pair, removing the polarization film on the inside of the lens. To quantify this, I work for UPS, and this job is VERY hard on equipment. Not just sunglasses, but clothing in general. I think these are plastic lenses and I am in search of glass lenses that will hopefully be a bit harder and less prone to all the things I've mentioned above."
2,Not what I expected,"A tad too small for me and I was disappointed to find out that Bolle had produced these in china not france. I gave them to my mother and purchased a pair of Arnette ""The Score"" glasses which I like a lot."
2,Unacceptable design and construction flaws,"While stylish, the nose piece was uncomfortable when first used. They sit too close to the eyes, and my lashes could rub against it, and they had bad tendencies to fog when you are outside. One of the plastic nosepieces fell off after about 2-3 weeks of wearing them. That was the last straw, so I returned them."
1,Didn't last a year,Inside of lenses are severely scratched within a year's use. To use the warranty Bolle expects you to pay a $30 processing fee. Will buy a $30 pair of sunglasses instead. Won't buy their products again
1,Did not last a year,"Well, I thought that I liked these until today. I have taken excellent care of these only cleaning with hand soap and lens cloth. Today a perfectly straight horizontal line appeared across the right lens which makes these useless."
3,so-so,"the lenses are excellent, the frames are not that great.they will most likely at the least need adjusting to make them not so tight on the sides of the head, but then they rest on your ears, so what ever you do they are not that comfortable"
3,"serves purpose, quick shipping, not comfortable","The shipping on this item was lightening fast--I ordered one afternoon and they were at my front door when I was leaving the house the next morning. The glasses are attractive and I love the polarization, but they are very uncomfortable in hot weather. There is no ventilation with these things, and you end up with sweaty eyes and fogged lenses. I haven't returned them because the price was decent and they do serve a purpose, e.g. when driving in a climate-controlled car. But there's no way I could use these as sport sunglasses."
5,great value,love these sun glasses and what an amazing value. Amazon's price is half that of my local sporting goods store and.... no tax or shipping costs
3,"""The Method Keeps Them Red-Man""","True definition of lyricism keeps these ""chich&chong;"" of rap on the high end of mainstream hiphop music... Method will surely no time soon lose his methods in performing, not to mention his partner in crime Red who seems to always give the people (either being urban or suburban) what they are seeking. Three stars are given from TSP Inc.""The eye's of thine only shall await thy moment of all to realize...""Respectfully,Tre`ShaunRSH"
2,formulaic horror story,"This seems like a very formulaic Stephen King knock-off. Granted, I'm not finished, but still, of what I've read.And sloppily written or edited, can't decide which.For example, in the oral narrative in Chapter Two, given from a grandfather to his granddaughter, he says that he is 101. He says that ""80 years ago"" (when he would have been 21), he and his father went past a certain tavern. In the next paragraph, he says his father died WHEN HE WAS 16! How is this possible?It's hard to take seriously (in its own way) a book which contains such obvious errors. The story is engaging, but I hope his next one is better."
2,"Fairly well written, but rather dull","It starts off with a bang, a great scene at an archaoelogical site, but peters out soon thereafter. Too many characters, two storylines, neither of which is very interesting. We see tihngs fromt the point of view of a possessed spider! C'mon, that's just plain silly. Too bad, because the author has good skills and command of the language. It's the story he tells that falls flat."
5,Great Deal,"We are very pleased with this purchase. Great quality and a good deal. The booster seat has plenty of padding for comfort. It is very easy for our child to enter and exit. We like that the armrests swivel up and out of the way, the cupholders easily fold in or out, and the head rest is easy to adjust.It arrived in the time frame specified."
4,Good seat,"This is a good booster. It seems a little wobbly after being used to a sturdy car seat, but my big 3 year old is very comfortable in it. It arrived quickly and was super-easy to install."
5,counter-logic,"I don't usually listen to jazz, but the minute I listened to the track ""Mi flor hermosa"" I knew this was good stuff... It's so sensitive and yet quite fresh. I'd definitely recomend this CD as a must have."
5,counter logic,This cd will make you a fan of jazz. WK balances solos nicely with the bassist and pianist. The 6 original tracks are fresh and enjoyable. WK plays sax and flute with heart and conviction. The hooks will grab you let you go then snatch you back baby! I'm humming them all day. Good show W.K.
5,Vanilla beans,These are very high quality and very fragrant. I am happy to have them in my kitchen to cook with when I want that extra punch or flavor.
5,Good beans,"The item shipped fast and the vanilla beans seem fresh, the pulp was easily scraped from the inside. Good product."
2,I guess Only God Knows Why This Was Made And Released?,"I dont get this. A Tribute to songs not old enough to have tribute paid to them...but yet, they sound absolutly no different to Kid Rock's versions, just different singers.This aint a tribute, it's people doing Kareoke... and tho it would sound good if you where actualy at a kareoke bar watchign someone sing these, you still wouldnt really wanna take it home and listen to it again and again.This album is just a a big question mark."
1,it's not (what you see - what you get),Today I bought this cd from hmv store and when I checked it on the internet about four or five songs are missing from my cd. could you pls. explain this to me?
1,does kid know ?,.....I didn't know if this disc was recorded for charity or whatever....It could have been done a lot better....you could have gotten David Hasselhoff and Clay Aiken with sore throats and it would have been better....I'm ashamed to even tell anyone I bought it...it is what it is
3,works but plastic breaks,"The charger does work and is a nice size (small). The plastic cover broke, exposing the soldered contacts at the micro USB tip end; allowing the wired connection to stress. Since I didn't get it all glued back together soon enough, the wires quickly broke free from the tip. It had been used daily for six month, but gently with no stress on the device (just resting in a cupholder)."
1,"Arrived on time, but lousy product.","I'm size 29,30 and according to the sizing listed medium should have been more than big enough. It was so small that I would have needed a large. The cup is okay, but the leg and waist bands are really scratchy. Didn't realize I couldn't return items until I tried to get a refund. Now I'm out the cost and shipping and stuck with two jockstraps I can't use!"
4,Great,"Someone else stated the size chart is off. Actually I am supposed to get a Large (by the size chart) but got a medium on accident. The medium fits perfectly. The item arrived on time and is very inexpensive. The pouch, on first wear, was a little itchy, but after hand washing, it was perfect. I would recommend this item to anyone."
5,gave this to a friend who could not believe how well it works!!!,"This product should not be with held from the American people,but it is.My friend didn't even know that this product was out there."
3,Wonderful book; poorly printed,"Unfortunately these Dorrie books have been out of print for years. I was so happy to see that someone decided to reprint them--happy enough, apparently, to spend $17 on a paperback version!!! For that amount of money I expect at least quality printing, but some of the illustrations were so poorly printed that lines and facial features were very fain or even missing. If not for the quality of printing I would give this five stars. What a wonderful book! I'm happier to have it than not, but for the price it should look better!"
4,Setting things up for the rest of the arc.,"The best books make you depressed that you've finished them. The good books make you desperate for the sequel. 'Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream' fell into the former catagory for me, while this falls into the latter.'Rebel Dream' was a breath of fresh air from the downward plunge of the New Jedi Order arc. By this book, the novelty of the Bantam style has begun to tarnish a bit. By the end we are ready to plunge back into the New Jedi Order proper, after a fun little diversion.Still, there's much to like. Allston's trademark humor remains spot on, and new story threads are emerging. Tahiri becomes a satisfying character independent of the fallen Anakin Skywalker. We see the first Dark Jedi of the series, who is quite unique for that label. The Yuzzhan Vong's response to it is priceless. Also, that twatty senator we all love to hate gets her comeupance.The real action should kick in with 'Traitor' though, coming out the later this month, which I eagerly await."
4,try harder,"since the hardback of ""star by star"", the writers seem to havelost steam on this particular series. which is a real shame considering that most of the books before 'star by star' had youclamoring for more. they have luke and mara on coruscant fightingan new and more vicious enemy that is destroying humans and yuzahoon warriors alike. han and leia are hopping from world toworld staying one step ahead of the enemy and jania is envolvedin fights to the death to keep the galaxy free of yuhazan vongwarriors. my question is when is someone going to pick up thethread of jacen solo? after 3 new novels after his capture, no one seems to want to touch this subject and it is getting annoying. if the next novel in this series is this boring, i think i will have to find something else to read."
4,"some good, some okay","I really like the first half of this book. I think if you put the last half of Rebel Dream and the first half of Rebel Stand together you would have one really wonderful book and the rest would be okay. Most of what annoys me about this book is the fact that my favorite characters (Jaina, Jacen, and Kyp) are not main characters. It is quite amusing at times, especially parts with Leia and Han, and offers at least one strange insight into life (""Does everybody just get stupid when they grow up?""-Tarc), which are the main reasons I liked this book as much as I did. I believe that if you liked the parts of the X-wing series written about Wraith Squadron, you will like this book."
3,"It's just sort of ""meh""","This book, and it's predecessor, aren't bad books. Aaron Allston's writing is good, as are his characterizations; the big problem for me is the era it's set in. I'm not a big fan of the Yuuzhan Vong war storyline, and mostly bought this book and it's predecessor because of the promise of Wraith Squadron and Wedge Antilles. I'd buy it used."
4,Cool and action packed,"it waz a cool book.I liked it when the gang get to search deep inside Coruscant since we never really knew what waz down their.Also it waz mysterious,and you could tell how all the stories come together.I can't wait for the next book Traitor comi'n this July 28,2002.I have to say this iz one of the best bookz yet."
4,Good...but,"it really needs to be longer in order to handle the large volume of characters involved. Actually, that has been true for several of the books in the NJO series. Cramming the plots for all the different characters results in a scattered, disjointed feel. But it wasn't so bad that it completely ruined the book.In fact, the book was quite good. Allston's writing style seemed closer to the Wraith books than Rebel Dream did. The humor was great and plentyful! I just wish he'd done more with Janson, and was actually rather suprized that he didn't. I also wanted to see more of Jaina (obviously), and I'd like to learn more about Jag. Hopefully they won't be completely ignored in Traitor."
4,Refreshingly good story,"A MAJOR improvement over the last few books, which were horribly disappointing. Sub-plots in this book keep your attention, and you want to keep reading.The book feels too short, though. Some story lines could have gone longer. Hopefully the next author(s) will build well on this foundation."
2,Enemy Lines II Rebel stand,"Slow paced, boring. Saved the best part for the last 40 pages. I hope the rest of the books in this series are not fillers as this book obviously is."
5,Huge Difference,"I needed to pads for the rear and my Mechanic told me to get ""HH"" pads. I went ahead and pads for both front and rear and Wow what a difference. It feels like I added another rotor. I never a new a pad material could make such a difference. In my research EBC seemed to be quite popular. I installed these pads without any issue and would highly recommend them. The seller through ebay shipped them quickly and without problems."
5,"HOLY COW, DO I LOVE THIS ALBUMN!!","i bought this albumn a million years ago, and i stiull listen to it every now and again. i love ""icb"" especially. it's just...so so good.!"
2,Overrated,"Although I can see the historical value of this album, as a bridge from Joy Division to New Order's seminal 80s stuff, it is simply not a very good album, particularly by today's standards. Essentially, because New Order was so influential, a lot of what they did has been picked up and bettered over the last two decades; the result is that a good part of Movement simply sounds amateurish. In fact, with the exception of 'Chosen Time,' Movement is fairly unlistenable, with a very Casio keyboard ethos throughout. Perhaps it is the production, as the ""Ceremony"" single that came out at the same time is very good. Anyway, if you are a big Joy Division fan and also like New Order, I would recommend this album, but then, of course, you already have it, don't you? Otherwise, pick up Republic, which is New Order's best and far superior to Movement."
4,seriously overlooked and undervalued,"Okay this isn't classic New Order. But its still a damn good record. People seem to forget that for changes to occur a transition period is needed. Well this is it. I mean MOVEMENT as a title says it all. They haven't got there yet they are still in motion. So these are closer to their Joy Division roots. But THEY ARE JOY DIVISION after all, with a different name, its not as if thats plagarism. Dreams Never End is fabulous, Hooks voice is more appealing than Sumners in my opinion. And of course Hannett has done a top job on production. This album is one of lifes unknown pleasures which needs to be experienced. Perhaps if Ceremony and In A lonely Place had been released on this LP instead of just a single then fans would have it in a higher regard."
2,It's not for MWg Atom Life,"I buy this thinking on to replace my stylus pen for my MWg Atom Life, but doesn't fit."
1,Think twice about buying this book...,"I checked out a copy of this self-published book (evidently the first, 1989 edition) via the public library, and I was disappointed that the text is all ""Courier"" font (i.e., it resembles ""typewritten"" text). Its rudimentary illustrations likewise look amateurish. Moreover, much, if not all, of this book's textual content (which, so far as it goes, isn't bad) appears in the author's expanded, better-illustrated, 1991 book TEACH YOURSELF POOL (ISBN 1880135000). The latter edition--whose most useful component is (collectively) its numerous well-explained ""shot-strategy/practice"" diagrams--is significantly more appealing and helpful (even though it still somewhat evinces a ""self-published"" look and feel)."
4,Instructional,As expected and excellent as always. Though could pack in some more recipes to justify the title and cost.The reviews are good.
3,NOT FOR HIGH-ALTITUDE BAKING,"While I love America's Test Kitchen in every respect, this DVD will not give you the results you are looking for if you live in a high-altitude. I live at 7,500 ft and none of these recipes work. To be a successful high-altitude baker, you must get a baking book or dvd that is specific to high altitude living.To that end, I recommendPie in the Sky Successful Baking at High Altitudes: 100 Cakes, Pies, Cookies, Breads, and Pastries Home-tested for Baking at Sea Level, 3,000, 5,000, 7,000, and 10,000 feet (and Anywhere in Between).Now then, what this DVD will give you is great technique. If you're new to baking, it's always a good idea to 'see', with one's own eyes, just what the technique is by observing how it's done. In this regard, I highly recommend this DVD."
4,Very cool airplane,"Very cool - glad I read the reviews before buying. I love that it runs on air. My 4 yr old has some problems doing it on his own, but i don't mind doing it for him. I think with some practice he'll be able to pump it up and throw by himself. He loves it. I'm surprised how durable it is. It took several hard nose dive crashes before I realized you have to ajust the rear flaps for proper flight (didn't read instructions - its a guy thing). and it didn't suffer any damage at all. Very cheap price for the thrills it provides."
1,A disappointment,"Yes, there are nice pictures but every recipe I tried failed or exploded, even though the directions were followed and my mom helped me. If you plan on buying this book, please consider these things first. It may be a disappointment to kids like me."
4,A Great Cooking Introduction,"My 22 year old daughter learned to be a very good cook using this book. We bought it the year it came out.She memorized the recipes and then adapted them through the years. She can bake bread and cakes from scratch by heart and loved many of the other recipes too. She used it to teach her brother and young cousins to cook as well. It came up when she just told her 15 year old brother that he should use the basic bread recipe to bake some homemade bread. It started her on the road to cooking, following cooking shows and collecting cookbooks."
4,IZOD,"This is a beauitful shirt well made, I gave it 4 stars because I wanted the standstone color to look like the picture as well as the way it was dscribed. It does not have the pink under-tone. It is tan stripes, but still very nice."
3,Media Wizard for VideoNow,"Why is it that they will come up with a great idea to make a product to create your own PVD's, but don't sell blank disk's? The Disks that come with the Media Wizard only hold about 20min of video which isn't enough for anything really. Why can't they make (and sell in stores like Wal-Mart,Zellers,Giant Tiger,Sears, etc) blank PVD's large enough to put a whole cartoon or even a movie on it? If they do, they should make them more available to the public. Overall, the VideoNow it's self is Great! But I wouldn't waste the money on the Media Wizard. It is almost impossible to fit anything on the disks."
1,CONFUSED,I was unable to get this product to work. I did manage to mess up the disc trying. There wasn't any directions or help tying to get this product to work. The seller was Excellent but the product was not so much.
2,Depressing...No support whatsoever.,I ordered this item and was so excited. It loaded fine. It let me upload files just fine. It wasn't until I actually tried to create my PVD that I received errors that shut down the program (many many many times...with numerous types of video files) I double checked the system requirements for the software and my computer checked out fine. The worst thing is that there is no support for the media player. I tried contacting Hasbro with no response. I am so dissapointed.
4,"Great idea, makes the player more versatile","A great idea from the creators of VideoNow. The availability of pre-recorded PVD is abysmal at best. Living in a small mid-western town I have always had trouble finding the PVD's anywhere but online. We do have a DVD player for the car, but when we go somewhere that requires waiting (the Doctor, Dentist, DMV, etc) the VideoNow is a lifesaver. Having the ability to make our own discs just makes it that much more versatile.The good news is that you DO NOT need to cut down regular CD-R's as one reviewer suggested - the unit will burn standard ""mini"" CD's which are readily available in most electronics super-stores and online for next to nothing. You end up being able to make your PVD for under a buck."
1,not worth the time and effort!!!!!!!,"i bought this for my son so that he would have more options on his videonow.well the media wizard is awful!!!!!!!when i tried to burn onto a pvd disk(it comes with 4) i got a ongoing pop up screen saying that there was a problem with the disk.once you try to burn something and you get a ""problem with the disk"" error,the disk is ruined.i have gone through 2 sets of these.!!!!!!!In my opinion they are not the worth the time and effort and i know it will cost more money in the long run to buy the regular videonow disks but are worth it.I do not like the media wizard,just awful.save your money on this one!"
1,Not a new drive and fails WD drive tests,I bought this to replace an old drive in an old dell. I opened the package the drive was poorly packaged. Then I connected it to my testing rig and ran WD's data lifeguard diagnostics test on the drive and it failed every test. This is western digitals own hard drive testing software tests the drive at the lowest level and it failed. These are not new drives and not worth the time.
2,Be Warned,"These drives might be ""new"", but chances are they've been sitting in an unopened box on a shelf for 4 years. Granted, I did expect that to be the case, but as soon as I plugged it in, it gave me the notorious death click noise. I promptly returned it and wound up buying a used one since I knew it worked upon shipping. I never bought a used hard drive but for these old ones, it might be worth it."
1,Whatever you're thinking of using this for - I'd try something else,"If I had to guess, I'd say these were a stack of drives that failed QA that they are looking for something to do with besides throw them away. Mine was from 2008 and almost immediately started showing bad sectors.I was just trying to use it to recover an old PATA drive, so I didn't have high expectations. But man, this thing managed to even trip over the lowest bar I could set.On the plus side, the platter actually spun."
1,DOA,"This drive came with a bent jumper pin, I bent it back into place hoping it'd still work, but when i plugged it into my machine the BIOS did not recognize it. I do not recommend this drive."
1,Defective hard disk,"I bought two hard disks. it was shipped End sep'12.I am from India, brought HDD to India during Oct'12. After installing one HDD was found noisy and computer does not detect HDD.another HDD is working but too slow.Now I am travelling to USA - NY again. But your website says i cannot refturn goods as deadline is expired.I am disappointed as product was defective and selling defective goods is NOT GOOD BUSINESS.You must arrange to collect defective HDD from my address on 15th or 16th Jan 2013 and refund me full value with freight."
3,You will all win all the time,I have orderd the wrone one but ito's kay I was reimbursed I call that real guarantee ever body can make a misstake but not all will reimbursed
1,Not worth it if it was free,Drive worked for 2 weeks then locked up. Contacted Western Digital and was told that the drive was made in 2004 and was supposed to be part of a built system by a PC manufacturer. No warranty honored...Should have lasted more than 2 weeks.
5,XP Install is a BREEZE!,"I just got this drive in 60GB. I had some problems with Maxtor and Windows XP -- so I jumped ship and bought the Western Digital becuase it had the ""Designed for Windows XP"" label. All I did was plugged it in and booted with the Windows XP CD and I was up and running in no time! So this drive is great for people who are novices at hard drive installs(and are using XP)!! I think it's a little noisy-- and a bit more expensive than others(you pay for the 7200RPM)- but I reccomend it to those of you who want to avoid the headaches!"
1,Item was used!!!,"Hard drive was advertised as NEW, sealed in OEM bag. It was USED in an unsealed electronics bag. In fact, there is dust in the recessed corners of the hard drive case. The cover had scratches and a dent in it. The manufctured date is 20FEB2005 (current date is April 10, 2012). Very, very, very disappointed and angry!!!"
1,False Advertizing!,If these hard drives are new then I am Santa Clause. They make more noise the a freight train. Very disapointed!!!!
2,Obviously Not New,"Although GoHardrive.com claims these are new hard drives, I've never opened a new drive with dust in the crevices on the bottom, or having sticky spots where a label used to be. But they still have some life in them."
1,Western Digital Caviar 80GB 7200rpm Hard Drive WD800BB,So poorly packed the drive arrived damaged and had to be returned. No packing in a box very oversized for a hard drive.
4,Nice drive,"This is a nice little drive for my kid's computer. As they get more songs and pix it may end up being too small, but it's in a computer with a slower processor anyway, so it's right for the money."
3,No sata hardrive,my mother board was meant for a sata cable harddrive. now i need to buy a sata adapter. its cracked too.
5,The best theraputic cold pack,"I've had a contour pak for about 15 years now, and it's the best cold pack I've ever used. It looks like I'm due for a new one, so I hope it's available soon. It maintains cold for a prolonged period without getting too cold (thanks to the fleecy outer surface) so that you don't have to remove it and it won't become painfully cold. The shape is a little awkward at first, but once you get used to it, it fits well over almost any application on the body. The straps as an option are great to keep the pack in place, or you can leave them off and use it by hand. I've used it for sports injuries and preventative treatment, and my kids have enjoyed it as well for soothing growing pains and the occasional boo-boo. Great product."
2,clip adds bulk,"Although I like the look and feel of the case, I don't care for the swivel clip. The clip adds around 3/4"" to the thickness of the phone so that it sticks out from a belt rather than fitting snug against the wearer. I plan to look for (and ""try on"") a new holder and will gladly give up the swivel feature for a slimmer model. Until I find one I like, I'll put my phone in my pocket."
4,stop playing games hoe! it's a (gangstafied gorilla ) thang,"Man i'm telling you now go buy this album because the only thing you'll regret on this album is not getting it.The twins are so 4real dog.Kane & able, if da money aint right we changing labels, leaving executive brains on da table, show yall (...) up in this game is fatal.Be on da lookout for dat new kane & able (...).I HOLLA. MOSTWANTEDEMPIRE taking over da country."
1,Not accurate,Bought this product to help my husband navigate the LA traffic and it is routinely inaccurate. Useless product.
4,Traffic Gauge works okay for Los Angeles,"Overall, better to have it than not, but there are a few key spots on the 10 Freeway that are not covered, so that's frustrating."
1,out of service,"Please note trafficgauge.com the company who provided the traffic date went out of business. There is no traffic data transmitted to this device, so it no longer functions as a traffic service device. Mine now makes a great door stop."
1,"No Signal in SF Bay Area, No response from Customer service",I have had product for 2 years but in past 6 months since I renewed for a new year I can not get a signal anywhere in the SF east bay area. Several calls and emails to customer service have gone unanswered.
1,Limit of 6 devices,"This unit isn't worth the expense.The primary problem with it is that you cannot have more than 6 devices on your network (desktop, laptop, VoIP, etc.). The router will only issue DHCP addresses to up to 6 devices.Also, if you want to use static IP addresses, you're pretty much scr*wed (yes, you can do it, but it's a PITA to configure)."
5,Forgotten Gem ......,"This album was recorded by four of Miles's enduring partners through his incredibly creative Quintet years, and a trumpeter who played alongside him. The chemistry is unbelievable; Ron Carter rises to the occassion for such classics as Pinocchio and Eighty One and the band plays one of the loveliest jazz tunes ever in 'Elegy'. A tour de force, underrated but very rewarding"
1,Skip It,"Unless you are 100% certain you will be camping in the most perfect weather, I would skip it. I was supposed to have good weather but it turned windy and the skinny guy line snapped. We watched helplessly as the whole tent grenaded in under a minute. The guy point on the other side tore out. The pole went through the floor leaving a big tear. This would be a better tent if it had more guy points and beefier guy lines. Another thing that was weak was the pin stakes that will not stay in the ground unless you have perfect soil. I can't say how it would handle rain."
3,"What you see, is not what you get!","I see your point of conserving on battery power, but if you turn off the LCD you are gambling with the final ""Framing"" of the photo. I tried NOT using the LCD and after downloading the photo's, I saw that the pictures had magicly moved to the right and to the bottom a bit. I had to over correct for this and it became a guessing game that I did not enjoy playing! I had seen pictures from my brother that bought the 315 from HP and I decided to exchange my 215 for the 315 Camera. Now, I have never used the LCD and every shot is perfectly Framed! I felt like I hit the Jackpot!! The 215 is a very good camera for the price, but the 315 is a better value at only $100 more. 400 pictures from a single set of Eveready Titanium batteries!! WhoooHooo!!!"
4,Pretty good for a starter and for the price,This is my first digital camera and it is good to start with. I bought the compact flash memory card reader to save on batteries when downloading pics. I was told by the salesperson to get rechargeable batteries but held off because HP rec not to use them. I may change my mind later though after buying so many batteries. I have only had the camera a few days but I like the lcd screen to view what I take pics of and choose to save or delete.
3,Warning: 215 Camera,"I have an HP 215 camera. The other day I had deleted pictures using the delete feature in the software. After that, the camera wouldn't hold pictures into memory. I have used this feature many times with no problems.I called HP customer service. They told me DO NOT use the delete photos feature in your software. It can render the camera basically useless. I told the rep. that I have been using it since I got the camera in June with no problems. He said there is some sort of issue with all the editing software. I use PhotoImpression which came with the camera. He told me to ONLY delete pictures manually using the camera itself. I told him that they needed to post this somewhere. It even says to use the delete photos option (in the software) in the quick reference book.Luckily, my camera was still under warranty. They shipped a replacement asap.Also, the 215 isn't suppose to use rechargeable batties."
1,JUNK BATTERY HOG,Be prepared to spend [price] on Batteries every 2 hours! I don't even give this camera 1 star but thats the lowest it'll go.You'll spend more on batteries than you did the Camera! I bought a new pack of Batteries and only got ABOUT 2 hours of use out of the camera and the Camera was OFF 99% of that time.
4,The ongoing rechargeable battery debate,"I wrote the HP product support people an email asking them if the 215 would accept rechargeable batteries and they responded that the circuitry would not be able to handle it (voltage or amperage not specified). What gets me is that AA alkaline batteries are 1.5v and AA rechargeable batteries are 1.2 - 1.4v, so I see no problem.Has anyone use rechargeable AAs with their HP Photosmart 215 and what were the results?"
1,Horrible product,"I bought this camera last Oct. just before my daughter was born. I have had nothing but problems with it. First - DO NOT buy rechargeable batteries for this camera. The people where I bought the camera sold me rechargeable batteries, and the first time I had a problem with the camera the people at HP told me that it is recommended that you do not use rechargeable batteries...so there was [money] wasted. The first problems I had was it would not save any pictures I took. I could not return the camera to the store I bought it at because HP does not want them to take their products back after 30 days...so I had to work directly with HP. They shipped me a new camera and within 2 months the camera didn't work again. Now the minute you turn it on you cannot turn it off without taking the batteries out. If you put it down it continuously takes pictures. I would NEVER recommend this particular camera to anyone."
3,Rechargeable Batteries a NO-NO,I think the 215 is a good value with great features and performance but it has a big flaw. The manual and the HP website both say that rechargeable batteries cannot be used. This is a big negative as digital cameras are notorious battery hogs. I'm not interested in providing retirement income for the Energizer Bunny. Thus I will return the camera.
1,HP Makes Lousy Cameras and Won't Support Them,"Our HP camera started taking pictures like the one at: http://67.168.53.83/dfranksweb/files/photo.jpg. HP support is in a foreign country, and they keep wanting to provide suggestions for improving the image. I'm sorry, but this camera is broke. There is no improving the image. Replace the thing already and move on. ""But have you tried holding it still?"" ""Maybe the flash is off?"" If they would just look at the pictures it takes, it would be fairly obvious. ""Is the lens cap on?"" Oh well, I'm off to buy a Canon. Thanks HP."
1,This product [stinks]!,"This is a bad product. It shift the picture to the right and upper corner so when you take a picture of the person, you may lose half of the face even if you can see the whole face in the viewport. And now I have to return it. I do online shopping for convenience but alas, I buy all these lousy incoveniance. I also had problems with other HP products.My advice: Don't buy this one and avoid HP/Compaq product."
2,Decent Camera,"Although I do enjoy this camera there are a couple of things to note: 1. Like the previous reviews my camera sucks up battery power quickly, if using the LCD. If not using the LCD the battery power stays strong a lot longer. 2. The LCD screen on my camera refuses to turn on maybe 50% of the time...a little frustrating!This camera does take very good pictures most of the time, if using the highest quality setting. Low light or indoors sometimes gives it trouble where the photo does not turn out good. This camera has a digital zoom, using it produces very low quality photos, it has no optical zoom"
1,NOT WORTH THE BOX IT CAME IN *******************************,i paid over 100.00 for this camera new. if i had the chance to buy another one brand new for 10.00 i would pass it up. this is the biggest piece of junk i ever seen in my life. to call customer service its 2.50 a minute with a 10 minute minimum billed to your phone bill. shame on hewlett packard. i will NEVER buy another hewlett packard product.
3,"Okay starter camera, but eats batteries","The pictures the hp 215 takes are decent, nice and clear and good for a webpage. However, they're difficult to take because of the minute+ time it takes for the camera to start up, and the 30 seconds+ it takes between pictures. Not to mention the batteries! I use good batteries, and this camera can only take about 15 before the batteries are dead, not nearly enough if you wanted to take this on vacation! In summary, good starter camera, but get something else if you want to travel with it."
1,JUNK HP CAMERAS,Worked for 3 days. Now its broke.. I used it 3 times at the most. After taking and downloading four (4) pictures and having to replace the batteries (new batteries) already. It uses 4 AA batteries. NO ac adapter comes with it.. THAT costs 49 bucks more. Now it wont work at all.. Ive tried to call HP for support.. NO Toll free number. I guess IM supposed to PAY for support for a broken camera. Get real HP.. . Beware if you buy HP....... I guess you get what you pay for..
2,I too am unhappy about battery usage,"I took a set of 80 pictures around the house in 30 minutes using the LCD before I received indications that the battery life was down. But in the field I get fewer pictures. I missed my chance to trade up because I realized too late that it drained battery power at an excessive rate. I am going to try NiMHs that one reviewer recommended. Considering what I use the camera for, the other limitations as expressed by other reviewers are not that much of a problem for me. I would definitely want to purchase a higher-line digital camera if I was serious about digital camera photography."
2,Only for Still Shots,"While this camera offers great resolution in its photos, it is so slow in reactions it renders the viewfinder useless. Plan on a five second interval between perfect shot and the camera reacting. Being a beginner at digital photography, I cannot compare this unit to the market, but I am very disappointed with the purchase. I wish I had spent more to get more. This camera also takes batteries at the rate of appx. one set of four AA per five pictures, when download time is included.All in all, I am not happy with this camera, and wish I had bought something better."
2,Major Battery Hog,"I purchased the PhotoSmartC215 because I liked the features, but it DOES hog batteries BIG TIME. Another thing I didn't like, is that it takes several seconds for the shutter to snap after you press the button,[very difficult to compose a picture that way.] Anyway, I burned through 2 sets of alkaline batteries just getting the feel for the camera. I got about 10 pictures from four batteries,both times. Unbelievable. I returned it."
1,Highly Unreliable Performance,"The on/off button is so poorly designed that you can't help switching it on by accident. By the time you decide to take a picture, of course the power will have been drained. Even if you take care of this (camera) like precious jewelry, you still need to avoid using any flash light and/or LCD display, for otherwise you will have to wait like 20 seconds for the battery to recharge before you can shoot another one. This would still not have been a problem if the camera could indicate the remaining recharge time. However, since the camera keeps the user in the dark, the user has no choice but to keep pressing the button until the camera takes the picture. More often than not, the timing is awkward; and the results, disastrous. Don't let this happen you."
3,Power requirements,"Previous review accurate enough, but....the user's manual states that rechargable batteries MUST NOT be used. Hello, regular battery high costs, because they don't last very long."
1,A piece of (junk),"The on/off button is so poorly designed that you can't help switching it on by accident. By the time you decide to take a picture, of course the power will have been drained. Even if you take care of this piece of (junk)like precious jewelry, you still need to avoid using any flash light and/or LCD display, for otherwise you will have to wait like 20 seconds for the battery to recharge before you can shoot another one. This would still not have been a problem if the camera could indicate the remaining recharge time. However, since the camera keeps the user in the dark, the user has no choice but to keep pressing the button until the camera takes the picture. More often than not, the timing is awkward; and the results, disastrous. It is simply frustrating.Even though this camera is cheap and does offer a lot of useful function, however, in my opinion, it is not worth the risk of trying it."
2,Find something else,"I got this camera for free, at a team event raffles. So I'm not complanining.The pictures are good enough for the web. But the camera is not good enough to be a primary-use camera.It is a power-guzzler. You'll need 4 rechargeable AA-size batteries.. 8 if you're going outdoors. And the charger too (a car-battery adapter, if you'll be on the move) !Takes ages to recover between photos, esp. while charging the flash. It actually takes a few seconds after I depress the shutter-release !! And by then, the whole world has moved ahead !!The LCD view-finder is useless for composing scenes. The picture is a blur if the camera moves even so slightly.The conventional view-finder is ""biased"". Leave a buffer above the subject.. otherwise, there'll be chopped heads in the photo.Bottomline... a scanner would be a better investment"
2,Not recomended,"As noted by other reviews, the biggest problem this camera has is the battery consumption. I was really happy with it untill I had taken 30 pictures and had to replace the batteries. Then I tried without the LCD on and got maybe 35 pictures, not much different. I expected a fast power drain, but I've used other camera's and got far more out of a set of batteries. On top of that, not being able to use rechargeables .... If you own a battery company, or got a crate of batteries for X-mas, this might be a good starter camera for you, but I traded mine in for a HP 315 and love it."
4,This Camera Has Seved Me Well,"I got this camera for Christmas several years ago (2001). It was a decent camera during its time. The battery life is non-existant. I used to spend a fortune on batteries. The memory card included allows you to take 12 pictures of highest resolution. The camera is huge, so it is hard to transport in pockets. When it focuses and adjusts to the light levels, etc., it makes an awful noise. The delay with the shutter did create some portraits of hilarity though as the people posing thought the picture was taken and it catches them between a smile and a straight face. It was a nice camera to have as a high school student, but after graduating from college, it is severely inadequate."
2,not impressed,"This was my first digital camera and I have to say I'm not impressed. First of all, the first camera I bought was defective. The memory card would not fit into the slot because the pins were bent. How that happened before I ever used it is a mystery. The viewfinder is way off, I've spent a fortune on batteries and have missed many good pictures because it takes too long for the camera to actually take the picture once you've pushed the button. About 10 months after I purchased the camera (and had the original replaced, remember) the LCD screen became very blurry so that I could not even see the picture that I'd just taken. It's also hard to take pictures with it because the image you see through the viewfinder is not even close to what ends up on the picture."
2,Batteries,"Just a note about battery usage. If you would read the user's manual you will discover that rechargeable batteries are NOT supported in this camera and any damage resulting from the use of rechargeable batteries voids the warranty. The power requirements of the camera are such that rechargeable batteries can be damaged or damage the camera and are therefore not supported in the camera. If you look on the rechargeable batteries you will notice that the power ratings are different from those of normal alkaline batteries. A better solution is to use the Photo Lithium batteries (NOT Lithium Ion batteries) with the camera, and avoid using the rear LCD as much as possible. Just a little FYI for those who post saying rechargeable batteries work great - RTFM (Read the freaking manual)."
3,Battery hog,"This camera is a great value, but it does have some flaws. The biggest problem is that it eats batteries like there's no tomorrow. I can get no more than 30 pictures out of a full set of batteries. Picture quality is pretty good for a digital camera in this price range. It's nowhere close to 35mm quality, but for digital cameras < $300, it's hard to complain. An easy way to improve this camera is with a built-in rechargable battery, like a telephone.PROS:1) Good picture quality for the price2) Easy to use3) Nice LCD display4) USB5) Memory upgrades are cheap6) Cheap7) Instant review lets you delete poor pictures instantlyCONS:1) Battery hog2) Takes severals seconds to reload between shots3) Each shot takes 2+ seconds4) Spontaneous pictures are impossible5) Built-in flash is sub-par6) On/off and LCD switches are poorly designed7) Cheap8) Memory access is slow"
2,CHEAP camera and you get what you paid for,The camera is pretty cheap if you are okay with putting up with constant frustration. The software has a bug in which the camera will not save pictures to the memory card. The only information you can get to solve this is to call into tech support which is NOT a toll free number. The camera is unreliable in picture quality and the on/off button sometimes does not function well. It's a good CHEAP camera.
5,IMPORTANT FOR YOU LUCY FANS,"Ever since 1994 when I saw my first I love Lucy episode, I really have loved Lucy! This tape which I personally own, has probably the funniest episode {besides Job Switching}. Lucy pulls a few strings to do a T.V commercial for Ricky's T.V. show. Well the Vitameatavegemin has 23% alchohol and you know what happens. However the next episode {Lucy and the Loving Cup} is funny and a favorite episode of many but since this video is part of the Lucy classics and I would not consider this a classic. In other words I could think of many other episodes that are truly classics and are far more familiar and funny. But if you Love Lucy try and find this video!"
2,Protect the innocent by punishing the guilty,"Of the 5 texts in this volume, only one can be attributed surely to Defoe.The texts on Sheppard relate the latter's extraordinary prison escapes and his wanderings through London until his execution. Those on Jonathan Wild explain how a criminal, playing very cleverly and deadly both thief and thief-catcher, could build a fortune.These are minor works by Defoe, and they have absolutely not the same high standard as his masterpieces (Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders).The text(s) on Wild is completely overshadowed by the treatment of the same story by Henry Fielding. Fielding's work is a masterpiece and highly recommended.The introduction of this volume by Richard Holmes is excellent.Only for Defoe fans."
1,Product not as advertised,"I ordered this for a friend who is very interested in all things Japanese, and this fit the bill. I checked the ingredient list before ordering, as the recipient has food allergies. I was so very pleased to see the item was acceptable! However, upon receipt, the ingredient list was totally different and no longer acceptable for the child to have. Very disappointing . . .Fortunately, the child understood my heart and was appreciative of the thought to get her all things ""Japan""."
2,I was hoping for better...,"After reading the reviews here at amazon.com, I decided to order this book. I've been working with Visual C++ 6.0 before, but I'm right now changing to .NET. This book seemd to be the one for me.Well, it wasn't. I just don't lika the way the author writes. Some authors can get you just drawling for more, and eager to get started. Well, this one didn't. I also don't like the authors way of focusin so much on distributed progams. Sure, distributed programming is an growing area, but still, lots of non distributed, desctop applications are made!After reading about half the book, I gave up. Instead I went for ""Special Edition, Using Visual C++ .NET"", and I have just started reading it. I hope it will give me a little bit more."
2,Not quite what I was looking for....,"If you are looking for anecdotes, autobiographical stuff..this is the wrong book..I bought it because I saw some good reviews BUT should have read more carefully...boring stats and explanations, goes on and on about one thing, kinda obsesive... I'm just reading it because I bought it; will re-gift it to a friend soon.."
5,Great read,Excellent book about the cultural differences and how it impacts players growing up in Italy compared to England from a top level player/manager who has experienced both. Highly recommend.
1,Don't throw away your money this is a rip off!!,"I was at the video store and I saw this video. I already owned the Urethra Chronicles (which is very good) and I thought I would give this a try. The video's subject isn't even Blink 182 just some English guy talking about punk rock. Then there are interviews with fans that don't even talk about Blink. Mark, Tom, and Travis are actually seen about 3 times in the whole video and there is NO music or concert footage. I actually took the tape out of the VCR and broke it, it was that bad and I'm a huge Blink fan. Use the 15 bucks to blow your nose in before you use it to buy this video. If you buy it you are throwing away money. Buy the Urethra Chronicles instead."
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS,"I bought this movie for my boyfriend for christmas, and thought it may actually have something to do with blink but it dosent. I was super pissed, he loves blink and was dissapointed. But I guess if your into porn stars this is the way to go.THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,IT STINKS!,"Unfortunately, the title of this piece of garbage shares the same name of one of the greatest punk bands ever.I got half way through it, turned it off and sent it straight back.The video makes a futile attempt to analyze the San Diego band. Since they can't get their hands on any copyrighted material, the video contains no music by Blink 182, no concert footage on Blink 182, no interviews by Blink 182, and certainly no relevant information that would have a Blink 182 fan held in the slightest bit of remote interest.It's shotty handheld, homemade camera work, horrible lighting, worthless editing and dry narration only further encourages the viewer to find a nice quiet area in the back yard and put it out of it's misery.Don't let the cover fool you. It's the only thing of professional quality about the video.Trust me. Save your money. Buy the Urethra Chronicles 1 & 2."
5,blink-182 bio vidio,"if you are a hard core blink-182 fan this is the tape for you! it tells you every thing you want to know about blink-182.this vidio is informative funny and cheap this movie is an exalent vidio ,you will love it!"
4,"Similar to Mario Kart Super Circuit, and that's a GOOD thing","As an avid fan of kart racing games, I love giving any game I come across in the genre a shot (within reason - I rarely play games that get under an 8.0 on review websites). I was delighted to recently hear about this one for the GBA, and I'm delighted to say it's actually pretty fun! It has a feel similar to Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart Super Circuit, and for die-hard kart racing fans, that's a great thing. The feel of the controls is crisp and responsive, and the track designs are pleasant. The game is a bit on the easy side, and the presentation leaves something to be desired, but in the end, if you enjoy the two Mario Kart games I mentioned, you should check this out. You'll be getting yourself into a fun racing game with tight driving at it's core. Oh, and no BLUE SHELLS. Those are the worst!!"
1,Defective Product,"The snap closure broke within the first week. Despite the reviews, the case is not tight enough to hold onto the phone without the snap."
3,Great case for leaving on all the time.,"This is a strong protective, and best of all, completely transparent case which keeps your phone free of scratches and knocks, and also has a low-profile belt clip. It allows your expressive phone cover to be revealed in all its glory, and unlike leather versions, does not spoil the look of the phone.It fits VERY snug, however, which is a bit of a pain when charging or mounting the phone, as plugs don't fit properly through the holes in the case and tend to fall out, the increased width means the phone won't fit in a dedicated mount with the case on, and removing it can be a bit of a struggle.Sadly, therefore, although I love it, I end up leaving it off 90% of the time, which defeats the purpose!"
3,Belt clip vulnerable,"The case is quite sturdy, but it took less than a month for me to break the belt clip as I was getting out of my car. Nevertheless, I'm ordering another one -- one I'll treat more carefully."
4,Not bad,"I bought this cell phone case for my 8260. While it securely holds your phone with its belt clip, the clear plastic on the phone pad isn't ""flush"" with the actual buttoms of the phone, making it difficult to dial the keytones. All in all it, it isn't a bad cell phone case. This case would of definitely gotten 5 stars had the clear plastic front been ""tighter"" and flush with the keypad."
2,Caution for younger readers!,"We like the other books we've read in this series, but many of the themes this particular book (Judson) were really too ""old"" for our nine-year-old and we chose not to finish the book. The graphic violence and sometimes disturbing theological themes may not be appropriate for younger readers. I would certainly not recommend this book as a read ""alone"". I would highly suggest a parental ""read along"" so that you can address any disturbing or controversial issues."
4,Good Overview,Not necessarily exhaustive but did give good insight into Adoniram Judson's life as well as that of his family. Good read.
2,Not well constructed,"I ordered 2 of these and 1 of the 8"" matching flopsie turtles. They are supposed to be bean bag type. Very little bean bag stuffing and not cuddle proof. I sent back and had to pay return shipping. Not a good value."
4,1 of many books that will always be needed,"I needed this book for a class I had to take in my seminary studies.""It fit the build.""It will come in handy for future references when I'm holding meetings or applying discipline in the church."
1,Junk - Do not buy this product,"I have replaced many fully-automatic Rule bilge pumps over the years because they all fail in some way or another. I continued to replace them because they fit well in the bilge on my boat and I can buy them wholesale. I hoped that the new line of automatic pumps were better -- they are not. Both 750A's I installed a few months ago now do not shut off after starting.Rule denies the problems, despite many postings by users on the Internet, and will not stand behind their product.Even at wholesale I will never buy another Rule product again."
1,Motor seized after first use,"Installed this to replace an old ""switch only"" Rule pump. My boat now stays in water all summer under a covered floating dock so an automatic pump was advisable. The motor in the RM 750A tested OK after install but apparently seized up the first time it engaged automatically.There was only one rainfall of any size that could have engaged the pump and the bilge was almost dry when I returned after two weeks. So it likely failed the first time it engaged after my installation test.Rule replaced it and I tested that one by running water in the bilge & it appears to function OK. Owing to the drought here in the southeast, I will have to wait til next year to see if the replacement has the same problem (Had to trailer my boat today owing to low water on our lake)."
2,Don't Even Consider Unless Commanded To By a Professor,"You will probably be purchasing this book for the same reason I did: you are in some kind of advanced degree program, and it's required for the course. And that would be the only reason I would condone buying it.This book is dry, folks. And it's filled with little gems like ""employees learn more from training programs they enjoy."" Oh really? REALLY??"
1,If You're A Meat Loaf Fan - Don't Waste Your Time With This,"If you're a Meat Loaf fan, don't waste your time or money on this cd. The music just wasn't the same and the group (The Bats Of Hell) couldn't capture the true essence and feeling of the songs as only Meat Loaf can. I guess in this case, imitation isn't the sincerest form of flattery, and as a big Meat Loaf fan, I cringed and had to turn it off when they started to sing Paradise By the Dashboard Light. It's unfortunate - they're not a bad group (the lead singer has a nice voice), but they need to find different material."
1,Bad Karaoke,I expected much better. I'm a huge Meatloaf fan and hoped this would be famous artists paying tribute to him. It honestly sounds like some guy singing Karaoke in a Holiday Inn.
1,actually 0 stars,"First of all,the writer trys to analize 2pacs music.Thats not going to work for someone who isnt a musician or the artist. He complains pac isnt real because his songs dont preach the same message. But as an artist.which pac was,its impossible and boring to say the same things over and over again.Yes,pac was a pollitical person,but that doesnt mean he has to always come at you like that.So all this guys contadictions and opinions about the resons pac was who he was makes no real since.ITS NOT A BIO.Its the writer trying to analize someone and there art. I doupt he knew or ever met pac so he cant make assumptions.I would read this book if i was you,but i wouldnt buy it.You can get it a public liabrary.Dont waste the $$$.Buy a pac cd instead and you be the judge.As for a bio,the music should explain most of it."
1,Don't Beleive the Hype!,"This is not a good, representative peice of Tupac's life nor his career. The work tries to demonize 'Pac, the same thing the media has been doing since he hit the scene. What is also disheartening about the book is that it fails to explain the method to Tupac's ""madness."" It is as if he was just some young, black troubled youth with overrated skills. Along with Ronnin' Ro and others, this is clearly a flawed and biased East coast (New York) peice of work that is played out too much in hip hop; nothing near the ""critical analysis"" or ""tough love"" that the author claims it to be. It's sad that a movie may one day be based on this dirt. Buy The Rose that Grew from Concrete, Got Your Back, Hip Hop America, The Three Wolves, anything but this garbage!"
3,Too interlectual in its writing.. not hip hop friendly,"Im only half way through ""Rebel for the hell of it"" and Im finding it really difficult to read. In the introduction, its written that this book is dedicated to hip hop fans as well as Tupac fans. I have not found this book easy to read and therefore not enjoyable yet."
3,"Uneven, but interesting.","This is an alright book about the life of Tupac. However, the book seems to be uneven. Armond White should have proofread his work before publishing it. Instead of sticking to one subject on certain aspects of Tupac' life, White goes completety off the subject when he talks about certain songs by other artists just to get a point across. These faults hurt his book. Also, There are ALOT of mistakes in this book. One noticeable mistake is the misquotation of: ""Is it Dre, Is it Dre,..."", from Dr. Dre's song ""LET ME RIDE"", NOT ""F--N WIT DRE DAY"". Despite all of that, this book is still interesting, but I suggest that all Tupac fans to not buy this biography, or wait until something better comes along.Peace El-715"
5,great book,this book was pretty good although some of it was hard to understand. the only real part of the book i didn't like was the fact that it talked about one thing so much. it would also bring up the same facts again and again. overall the book had some really good information in it and if you are a tupac fan then you will really enjoy it
1,A disappointed black activist,"Even though Armond White writes in English, somehow I don't really understand his writing, it's like he is communicating in a way I simply don't get. Anyway it seems like there is two things on Armond Whites mind, he wants to glorify black people and he sees the hardships black people experience in the US today as a result of white suppression and racism. The golden age for Armond White is the Black Panther activism of the 60's. In this book he tries to place Tupac's gangsta rap into the Black Panther tradition, but must acknowledge that it is impossible. It's quite suprising that Armond White seems to get pissed by the fact that Tupac scores a megahit with 'California Love' in the mid 90's, instead, one senses, Armond White is disappointed that Tupac doesn't take up the proud tradition of black activism, but rather indulges in violence and commercial success."
1,Embarrassing and bad,"This guy Armond White writes in the kind of pseudointellectual, exaggerated style that is really laughable. Rather than just focusing on the inherent drama and sadness of 'Pac's life, he has to throw in references to Morrissey and all kinds of other non-sequitors just to show how ""deep"" he is. Instead of reading this lousy bio, listen to ""Hail Mary"" or any other classic Tupac track and you'll get much more out of it."
1,author is a sorry man.,"this was a terrible book ,the author himself has no respect for the dead and the book does not justify Tupac's legacy and all what he meant to us as one the greatest rappers of all time.the book doesn't even mae any since."
1,Tupac should haunt the author,"This book did no justice to Tupac. It was more of analysis of his songs not of him. It no real research done in it. It also had some stuff and Biggie Smalls. The title should have been a ""poor atempt to anylise Tupac's songs."" Do not get this book it is not worth it."
1,Rob Marriot is DA MAN,"I am completely with Rob Marriot,this book wasnt even really about tupac, he would describe somethin; and then wander onto somethin else, and by the time you read the bulls**t at the beginnin and you;ll understand................"
1,If there was a 0 I would give it that,"Overall White's analysis of Tupac's music is so heavily biased toward African American Culture that it becomes moot to even finish reading this book, because it is so repeativeThe writing is also elementary. There were many times when reading I would have to reread it over, stop, think and figure out what he is saying.Dont bother buying this"
5,Green Acres,"It's a very funny old TV show. It's on once a week here. A retired friend loves to watch it, so it was a gift for him"
3,Not the Best,The first two seasons of Green Acres are more entertaining than the third but there are still alot of laughs to go around in this installment.
3,Eddie and Eva still please their fans,"Eva Gabor and the late Eddie Albert are still pleasing their many fans in the third season of Green Acres. Those who love GA also love other Paul Henning creations and productions,The Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction. TBH was the longest-running of the three,though."
3,Hooterville,I have one complaint about Green Acres and that is the quality of the audio sound. I find myself having diificulty listening to the characters without having to turn the volume up. Other than that I really enjoy the plots and the characters themselves.
5,Green acres,"Green acres is a wonderful comedy it is one of the best oldies comed series,according to me only three seasons are avaible so enjoy the series."
4,Whirlaway 191,Original equip lasted 7 hard years. Moderate difficulty of installation.Excellent value strong and compact when compared to competitors of equal power.
5,whirlaway garbage disposal,"This is the third home I have lived in where I have had this exact disposal istalled. I love it. Works great. It's not quiet, but not too loud. Will buy again and would recommend."
1,Sub-standard,"Made the mistake of pulling my unit out before checking out the new one. As I installed I realized it lacked a set-up for the anti-gag tool. It does include a schematic on how to insert a broomhandle and twist in case of a lock-up, pretty freaky. It was the first elecrical appliance I had ever seen that didn't have a threaded connection for the input clamp. May be illegal. The opening of the standard unit I took out was 3 inches plus and the new drain opening is now 2 and 1/2. The motor acs like its in a bind when I put a cup of green peas down. I'm sure proud it's on that heavy duty american express with the extended warranty. Save your money and get a real disposal"
3,Garbage disposal,"Only reason the rating is not higher, is that it replaced the identical item that had stopped working, I must admit though that the item was receiver within 72 hours of ordering"
3,okay,"it's thicker than i expected, and not too easy to see the #s on the scale (i have 20/20 vision too). but it works fine."
1,Health-O-Meter Scale,"Not what I had in mind--the dial was so small that I could not see where the pointer was pointing. I am sure it is a good scale all around, it might just not be right for me."
5,Friday Night Shabbos Services,"Looking for a great, spiritual, Shabbos prayer book- this one has it all. Traditional in nature with english passages that are up to date."
5,Exactly what our church needed,"Absolutely love this spotlight, it works really well in our medium-sized auditorium. The floor distance is about 60 feet, and had the spotlight in the balcony. Super bright, did it's intended job to perfection.We used to rent the lights and paid half the cost of this for every production we did. Sure we got bigger lights with different colors and lenses, but all of that was overkill. This light puts an adjustable-sized spot right where we need it.Seems sturdy and well made, though we have only been able to use for one event and now it is in storage until our Easter program. Cost savings is tremendous, and I don't think I could be happier with it. We will probably end up buying a second and having a double spot, but the program we did didn't require that. Soon I'm sure!"
1,Not even close to the stated gauge rating,The wire in the package are not even close to the stated gauge ratings. the power wire is actually 8 gauge and not 4 gauge. the speaker 12 gauge is actually more like an 16 gauge. No wonder is sold at this price.
3,"Nice kit, 7 gauge wire.","The content of the box is very nice, but 4 Gauge wire is the suject we want. Copper (if it is copper) diameter is 150 mils (4G - 204 mils), which is between 6 and 7G. It is good for 90 Amps, real 4G - for 140 Amps. Not a big deal in my case. Overall quality is good, cables are soft and nice. Fancy fuse, you will need to mount it somewhere under the hood. My old fuse looks like a 5"" piece of wire - this seems to be more convenient."
3,Good Ol Time Songs,"These songs took me way back when, especially I'll make it alright. I thought that song was long forgotten from the late 60's early 70's. Good Job!"
2,Not what i really what i was looking for,Its 885 pageses of simple definitions no diagrams no illustrations for a book that claim to cover the field of electrical and electronic engineering it's a far cry.
4,Great fpr stainless steel,"If you have a new kitchen with the stainless-look, as I do, then you know you need a product that cleans and shines without streaking. Glass cleaner is OK, but for that back-to-new look, I like this product. Easy to use, never streaks, and my appliances look great. Cleans around the oven door and inside the microwave too. One star off because it does not clean the enamel cooktop as well as I like; for that I use Scrubbing Bubbles. Considering all the stainless surfaces in my kitchen, I can't be without it."
1,Doesn't fit Genesis Stainless Steel Gold C Gas Grill,"Despite what it says on the Amazon web page AND what it says on the packaging itself, this does not fit my Genesis Stainless Steel Gold C Gas Grill purchased in April 2003 (it's about a half-inch too short).After finding out it didn't fit, I called Weber to find out what the deal is. After some checking and re-checking the Weber customer service rep said they don't sell the warm-up basket for my model of grill via retail outlets, and the only way to get it is from Weber directly. It cost a few dollars more but they didn't charge for shipping.Fortunately Amazon's stelar customer service provided a prompt refund and did not charge me for return shipping;."
2,jmc,"I called Weber to verify the basket fits my Genesis silver B model and WEBER factory customer service informed me this item does not fit my model, which they had registered and knew what model I was referencing. The guidance on many Weber accessories is incorrect according to what Weber customer service reps. are telling customers. Either Weber CS is wrong or the Weber person filling in the detail on the items is wrong. I strongly suggest Weber managment cross check all detail on Amazon for accuracy and/or straighten out their service reps.. This was a bad experience and occurred on multiple accessories I was trying to buy."
1,Didn't fit,I didn't read the reviews on this item and wish I had. This basket was supposed to fit my model grill and it was too short. Apparently this is a problem that many people have experienced.
1,Bought two both don't fit Genesis Gold C grill,Clearly a manufacturing mistake that Weber is not correcting. The basket is literally an inch too short. Now I have a Weber Grill with no basket at all with no way of replacing it.
4,Old-fashioned suspense in a modern setting,"I bought this on the strength of writer/director Tennyson Bardwell's first film, the independent ""Dorian Blues"", which won many awards at gay/lesbian film festivals. Bardwell has really come of age as a filmmaker, delivering a high-quality production that stands right up there with anything else made today, and will appeal to all. I was particularly delighted with the ongoing suspense he maintained without ever resorting to gore or violence. My heart was beating rapidly for much of the movie, and it left a smile on my face to know that quality suspense films can still be made without shock techniques."
2,Not Great,"Most of the movie bordered on interesting. It had potential. The characters were ok. Tom Arnold wasn't as annoying as usual. Zoe wasn't present enough. The main character was a little too stiff and not well represented. But all-in-all, it was ok.The real disappointment came at the end. I won't get into any detailed spoilers here other than to say that the ending was anti-climactic and left open for debate about just exactly what the hell happened. So it wasn't so much that I was left dissatisfied with the ending as much as there was just no satisfaction or sense of closure to it.There was, however, good suspense in several parts of the movie. I found most of it entertaining. But you need a good ending to keep the rest of it from feeling like a waste."
3,The Skeptic movie,"It was nice to have a movie that actually tied in all events and made sense. It's not by any means a ""horror"" movie though. It's more of a dark drama in my opinion. It was captivating enough to keep my interest, but has zero on the ""scary"" scale. It's about the damage people do to each other. I'm not sure I liked the ending. It was confusing and I questioned what it truly meant. It was ok to watch and those that aren't horror fans will probably like it."
4,Where did this one come from?,"I've seen this movie offered through netflex but decided to pass. Glad I caught it on showtime. I never heard about this one. It was worth the watch..I hated the ending, but only because this one isn't like most movies and I wanted there to be a different ending. I'll leave it at that. Watch this one."
3,I WAS A SKEPTIC ABOUT WATCHING THE SKEPTIC! 3 1/2 STARS!,"The Skeptic is a mixed bag of a horror film, but I will give it credit for at least having atmosphere and actually generating some sense of eeriness. The film is a little uneven with some unnecessary subplots, but I think in terms of giving the viewer that uneasy feeling in a haunted house, it works better than many other films of this nature. I also liked how a lot of the haunted happening were explained away by silly over active imagination. It actually makes us a little confused thinking....is this house haunted?.....are these things really happening? It's works very well on this level, but I found that Tom Arnold's character was almost completely unnecessary and the film seemed to steer away from the main story losing focus.I do think this is a film worth seeing and could have been a real winner. It's a shame because not many horror films have this much going for it....maybe if I watch it a few times I can start to overlook its flaws?"
4,cool!,"The book had wonderful tales, though I skipped the one that was in poem form. I don't understand why that story was done that way. Tales are meant to be read like stories, not poetry. Fave tale was the Good Knight, with Nikol and Michael meeting Lord Soth. At least I was able to know that there was a good side to Soth, even though it only happened once."
3,Music From the CBS Mini-Series (Soundtrack),"Nice, but includes some really old stuff that doesn't sound at all like the Rat Pack mojo tunes everyone is hungry for. Does show a real progression of his work, however."
1,Rooster hen Chicken Farm Animal,Back to Nature sent the product without the battery or note that one was 'somewhere' in the packaging. I contacted them and re-sent the item in original package US Parcel Post for $7.48 and it has been 6 weeks and no response or correspondance from the supplier. Formal request for assistance from Amazon in this matter.
4,HP quality [for a great price],"If your shopping for quality and price in a digtial camera that's easy to use, easy to carry and store, easy to upload to your computer, HP software to share and email, this is the one for you! A great bargain..."
4,Great Deal,I really like this camera for it's overall value. It has all the functions that are important to me (2.5 zoom and 2.1 MP) at a great price. I was a bit unhappy at the quality of the pictures in full glaring daylight. Overall I'm very pleased with this camera.
2,Problem if you use Windows XP,"I really loved this camera until I got a new computer with Windows XP. Hewlett Packard web site says it is fully compatible but it isn't. I can no longer use my 64mg CompactFlash Card...Windows XP can't recognize it. Hence, can't get my pictures. After a lot of trying this and trying that, an HP tech told me the truth...HP 315 Photosmart will not work using a 64mg card unless you unload it with a card-reader. That is a $40 to $50 ""option"" that is now a necessity if you plan on using 64mg or higher CompactFlash cards. HP will do nothing and it really pains me because the 315 is a gem of a first digital camera."
4,Great starter camera,Great camera for all the begginers out there. It does work with xp. You can get 41 of its best quality pics on a 32 mb cf card. I would recemend rechargeable batteries since it takes about four pictures with flash and lcd to kill them. great pictures and comes with good software.
4,Great introduction to digital!,"I bought this camera in April and have had great luck with it. I think that for the money, it is a great ""starter"" digital camera. There aren't a lot of confusing options, and it is very easy to operate. I suggest buying an a/c adapter with this (or any) digital camera to avoid draining the batteries if you are near an outlet while shooting, or while unloading the camera. My only complaints are that it can't take action shots because the subject blurs. To be honest, I am not experienced enough to know if this happens with more expensive digital cameras or not. But for basic photography, I think this is a great choice. I have never had a mechanical problem with it, and I think it has paid for itself in the film development costs I've avoided...you only get the good shots printed, and just delete the bad ones!"
2,You can do much better.,"This camera is fine if all you want do is take still-lifes with a wide angle lens, and not pay a lot of money to do it. Otherwise, look elsewhere. The auto-focus, which you can't turn off, means a huge several second delay between the time you push the button and when the exposure gets made. The result is that kids, who were giving you a great smile, are caught looking down at their jackets, dogs have run out of the picture, etc., in frame after frame. This is REALLY frustrating. Additional issues: battery life is an ongoing problem, and the software has a major flaw which evidently in rare cases can render the camera permanently unusable. The company (to their credit) addressed this by sending us a new camera. AAgh! You can do much better."
4,E L EDWARDS,COMPARED TO OTHER CAMERAS I HAVE USED THIS ONE IS EXCELLENT FOR THE MONEY. I HAVE OWNED A KODAK OF THE SAME QUALITY AND THE HP IS FAR BETTER. RESOLUTION CONTROL IS ON TOP OF THE CAMERA.THAT IS NICE TO HAVE AT YOUR FINGER TIPS. USB INTERFACE BEATS SERIAL PORT ANYDAY. HP STUFF IS GREAT ANYWAY. FOR THE MONEY IT CAN'T BE BEAT.
1,Broken in 13 months,"I spent [alot of money] on this camera 13 months ago and now it does not work. I'm about to throw it in the trash right now. Performance up to this point was very good, but because the warrenty on this camera is only one year, and the cost that HP quoted me to repair it was [almost as much as the camera cost], I am forced to buy a new camera. If you are going to buy this camera, you might want to invest in an extended warrenty."
5,This is a great start into digital photography!,"The PhotoSmart C315 was actually my third choice when I was looking into digital cameras. I'd considered the Olympus, but ruled it out on features. I then settled on the Fuji, which was out of stock. Being in a hurry, I switched to this one and have been very happy with the choice.Being a Mac person, my choices were limited to begin with, but I made the right one here... even if it was by default. Not only does this camera give crisp images, but it also mounts to my desktop as an external USB hard drive for click-and-drag simplicity.FYI- When not using the LCD monitor as a viewfinder, the batteries will last quite a bit longer. Also, the Super Fine mode cuts the number of pictures you can take in half with negligible quality difference between the Fine mode. Stay with Fine unless you're just set on having fewer pictures.Overall, this camera gives high quality images and is easy to use."
2,poor purchase,"This product was a poor purchase, it's photo quality is fair but its durability is awful after about 3 weeks my view frame would not work and the batteries had to be replaced every couple of days. The response time for the image to actually show up on the screen was exceptionally long also."
2,Quite Disapointed,"My previous camera was the HP C200, which from an image quality standpoint was fantastic. My mistake was carrying this opinion over to the 315 model. There are improvements, such as a far superior LCD screen, and better battery consumption. However, the image quality is unacceptable. The images have a clear grain to them, even under professional lighting. This is evident both on screen and printed on photo quality paper. The firmware update did nothing to correct this issue either. I would strongly suggest purchasing another model, or another brand all together."
1,Won't last more than the warranty,"I bought a Photosmart 315 digital camera a year and a half ago. This month the flash stops working. I contact hp, they wouldn't provide customer service over the phone unless i was under warranty or I paid $25. I refused to pay $25 to speak to someone who will tell me that yes, my camera is broken and it will cost more than the camera to fix it.The camera worked decently well until the flash broke. The delay in pressing the button and taking a picture was ridiculously long. Otherwise I was satisfied for 13 months."
3,COMP USA Purchase...,"For the price I bought it for it is a good deal. It uses up the battery life too fast for my liking, but rechrgables are easy to get and so its alright. If you can wait for the optical zoom camera's to drop, definitely wait."
1,unhappy with product,"I purchased this camera as a starter , but it didn't evenmeet up to starter requirements.. as far as I am concerned Iwasted my money ..Pictures are all distorted with no clarity and colors are almost non existant.. not a happy camper"
2,Very Low Value,The value of this microcosmic wonder is funny and/or amazing/extraordinary in theory though that is cannot be proved through scientific evidence of that particular nature. A very flashy piece that fills one with joy and promotes the taking of pictures in many scenerios. I would also like to note that this camera is a lovely item to play catch with if you are into baseball games and such. I would \would not purchase this crafty piece of merchandise because it might trick you into a deceitful act of trickery and/or mischief\thievery of some sort.
5,Not bad for an inexpensive digital camera!,"I really like the HP PhotoSmart 315 Digital Cameraby Hewlett Packard. This is my first digital camera. It's really easy to use, and takes very good pictures! Uploading the pics to your computer couldn't be easier. All you have to do is install the software and plug the camera into your computer. The software prompts you on what to do next. Great starter camera!"
2,Problem with narration,"Prague is beautiful from the pictures but the narration and background music makes it almost impossible to watch. The narrator goes on an on in a monotone, speedy line of chatter that is difficult to follow and very often has no connection to the pictures being shown. It makes it difficult to want to visit Prague from the presentation here."
5,If you have any interest in Maya art these books are a must,"There are 6 books in this series now. They have all been published to make use by students and academics easy. Each book is full of around 100-200 decorated ancient maya vases. Justin Kerr developed the 'roll out' method of photography to show these vases in their full glory.In the first book each photo is black and white, but each pages shows a good quality photo of the vase in full, with the design easy to see. All these books are bound in ring binders to make them easier to use on a photocopier and are A4 paper in size. The later issues of this series also include some colour roll-out photos. The easiest place to obtain these books is from the author. There are also a number of essays at the back of each of these books on subjects related to the vases by eminent Maya scholars.If you are doing any research into the maya these books are invaluable."
3,Missing Pages,"Book ends at page 422, with no index. Didn't realize it until I had already highlighted heavily. A free replacement would be nice."
3,Good overview but . . .,"This book gives a good overview of the Religious history of America during most of the book but it begins to falter near the end. The authors completely leave out the Jesus Movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. As the authro writes about more recent events, a bias seems to creap in. The activities of the religious left have a tone of approval while the activites of the religious right are written with a tone of disapproval."
4,From Theocracy to Plurality,Very good book that gives a general overview of America's religious history. Beginning from the first European explorers and settlers upon the New World and ending with the great mass of plurality of religious faith and spirituality that makes America distinct from the rest of the world. Shows both the good and bad religion has played on the American landscape. Has a lot of great historical pictures and illustrations as well. This book comes highly recommended for both the casual reader and/or the academic student.
3,enviro composter,"This product is much better than the trash cans I was using, but it is hard to handle. Unless you are strong and healthy, once it is full it is almost impossible to roll so the material will turn into compost . Then getting it on and off of the stand is quite a challenge, rolling to the spot you want to dump the compost and then getting the compost out of the container is very tedious. If you are strong and abled body, go for it."
1,One star is too good! Is there a cure for this virus?,"This is perhaps one of the worst tributes I have ever encountered, and I understand why the individual singers' names are absent. The vocals are terrible, and the lead singer, who has no lower register, shouldn't attempt any track not in her range, which means all of the material here. Her vocals often get lost in the music. The CD sounds like a bad experience on karaoke night, and the singers display little or no talent. I gave the CD a full listen, thinking it couldn't be this bad throughout, but no such luck. I was expecting more, but got something akin to a vanity press. Like a vanity press, I wonder how much these people paid so they could brag that they've recorded a CD - that they've been published!! Don't waste your money - buy the original Carpenters recordings and enjoy them instead."
1,"Oops, Wrong Album","I heard this soundtrack at Kmart, seriously. Pure dreck and the title of my review? I thought Borders was asking me to review the album by the alternative artists."
4,Looks good in our courtyard,"We've had this in use as a plant stand outside for a couple of months. No problem with rust yet, which was mentioned in other reviews"
5,"If you love ER, you'll love this book","This book, Nothing Last Forever by Sydney Sheldon is a very interesting book. It has a lot to do in medical field, but you don't have to be in order to read this. You can love this book even though you never thought about being in the medical field, like me. The setting is here in the Bay Area, San Francisco, and the story is about three women working in a hospital facing difficulties such as harassment from male doctor. Working in a hospital, they were exposed to tough decisions, fears and the unknown. I like the book, especially how the author wrote it: with suspense drama and very descriptive narration. Sheldon is really a very talented author. I would recommend it!!!"
2,"Terrific photographer, sub-par book","Having seen much of the work presented in this book in a gallery in Manhattan earlier this year, I can testify to its quality. Experiencing it live is pretty overwhelming - one really gets sucked into the world of each photograph. I'm afraid this volume does not even come close to recreating the experience. The reproductions are quite small-scale & printed on non-glossy stock, losing huge quantities of the vividness & detail which are these photographs raison d'etre. In person, I was able to spend hours standing in front of these photographs, absorbing the tiniest details. Those same details can't even be made out here. I was truly looking forward to the release of this volume, but I'm afraid after seeing it that I wouldn't bother to purchase it. A real disappointment - hopefully at some point a monograph will be released that's actually worthy of Crewdson's work."
3,"Gregory Crewdson book, used.","My purchase experience was only ok. It took a little while for it to get to me, the condition was stated as 'used, like new' it was really 'used, like used' a few tears in the cover, the book was slightly warped. if i had known this before hand, i would not have saved myself the measly 3 dollars and bought the New one. it should have been significantly cheaper than the new price because it was significantly not new.But honestly, im not upset because i love Gregory Crewson and the images in the book, not its condition, is what i really care about."
4,"Great case, Finally!","I have had my Sam8500 for a while and could never find a case that works for me. This case gives me easy access to the phone and adds a little bulk to talk with handset on my shoulder (while looking for my hands free). The swivel clip is great for clipping to my purse strap so I don't have to dig. You have to love the quick release button for quick answering. The only drawbacks I see are; you have to take it all the way out of the case to charge the phone, so the earpiece hood gets streatched out of shape. Also the indicator light for incomming calls is covered by the case so in loud areas you could miss calls, if the phone is not pressed to your body on vibrate. But all in all, FINALLY, a case that works."
2,I don't even use it!,I bought it and I'm not even using it. Your phone won't close completely when using this body glove.Also it may covers partly of your web browser screen.
2,Hard to follow the mittens instructions,"I do have a number of Nenah's DVDs but this is the first one that I really tried to follow. I was hopeful that this set would provide better instructions for learning how to knit a simple mitten. But it was not. I do think that including written instructions are good BUT the whole point for someone purchasing the DVD as a learning tool is to follow a complete project end-end using the DVD . I would not recommend this DVD is your are not an experienced knitter. The ""Learn to Knit"" with Tracie Wunderlich does a much better job at teaching you how to knit a mitten."
3,Shirley Temple Story book,"Loved the sotries, however one of the disk was completely blank. Very frustrating especially when my grandchildren wanted to watch that story"
1,It is not a boxed set. It's six dvd's in one multi dvd case.,"Disappointed in the item received. This was to be a gift, so I was expecting a 6-dvd boxed set as pictured and described ""6-pk"". Instead it is 6 dvd's in one multi-dvd case. Not quite the same impact as a boxed set."
3,Not as expected,"The movies contained in the set are OK, however; it is a little misleading. ""Shirley Temple"" is an adult in the movies that she does ""star"" in. Don't go by the packaging."
4,Shirley Temple,It was a gift I bought for someone. Don't know how they like it. I know she will like it because she has notseen any of the movies before.
1,Shirley Temple all grown up. Misleading packaging!!!,"We ordered these for our 4 year old, had the impression that this was a collection of Shirley Temple productions from when she was a child. Why wouldn't we, there's a picture of her on the cover with her pixie smile and red curly locks. Instead, we get a set of cheesy videos with bad acting and garish sets and an adult Shirley Temple showcasing her own children in some of these productions."
2,Very Disappointed,"This was a Christmas gift for young girls. I thought it would be actual Shirley Temple movies which they would haveloved, and of course they weren't. It was too late to return them so I gave these to the girls anyway. I was extremelydisappointed in this purchase."
3,Perhaps belongs more to the past than to retro review,"I bought this collection on the strength of my very fond memories of one of the stories in this collection (with Shirley as the Mermaid). I have to say I was disappointed to see this show again. Was my imagination so great back then that I imagined scenes that really were never there? Apparently so!! Either that, or this is an edited copy!Things that did not bother me at all as a child bother me a LOT now as an adult -- like poor stage makeup and theatrical acting on film. I saw too much theater here, making it all seem more ""fake."" I have looked at the beginnings of two or three stories in this collection but could not bring myself to finish any of them (except the one about the mermaid which disappointed me so). I'll try another one or two and then I will probably give the whole collection to Goodwill. Sorry, Shirley. I'll always love you anyway!!!!"
1,Not what I expected,I thought this would be a collection of the movies we remember as kids. This collection is from Shirley Temple's TV show. I guess I should have read the fine print :)
4,Cute and comfortable,"I bought these shoes to wear with pants and jeans. They are just what I was wanting, a shoe that is comfortable enough to wear all day but was also cute."
4,"Works well, Wrong Picture","Thanks Mr M for uploading the correct picture. The Rhythem Tech site doesn't even show the arm as shipped. It is just a 3/8 bent rod with a magnet mount welded to the tip. But it allows you to grab the Trigger Triangle quickly or play it mounted. They should add a magnet to hold the striker! Amazon has the wrong pictures for nearly all the Rhythm Tech Triangles. The RT6000 shows the Ribbon Crashers instead and the RT6006 shows the Trigger Triangle not the standard triangle shipped! Come on Amazon this seems to happen frequently according to many reviews. Please write a review when it's not right so we can all get wiser! Read the Descriptions carefully, they are usually correct."
1,drummer,You do not get what is shown in the photo. What I got did not even hold the triangle or attach to a stand. Waste of $.
4,Nice action and sound,"Great sound and action from the trigger. The only down fall is the bands do not last too long and can be difficult to get, until now, I have found a local supplier that carries them for me. Suggestion, remove the triangle from the trigger frame and the bands last twice as long."
1,not a dvd,This is not a DVD. It is an audio concert recorded in DVD format. Do not expect to see a concert. The visual portion is just some static titles. I returned mine as soon as I saw what it was.
5,Excellent Auto Body Repair Guide,"This book is written in an easy to read style and gives you what you need to know to make basic auto body repairs. It's like the authors were sitting down beside you telling you what to do. Unlike most auto body repair books, they don't assume that you have an endless supply of cash to buy every tool known (a very important consideration for most of us). I took it out from the library (along with many others) but this is the only one I'll be adding to my personnal library."
1,I hate this CD,"All of the tracks are annoying, either from wack beats, wack flow, needlessly repeating his name, or stupid hooks.... I can't play this at all. Even the tracks that I somewhat liked like ""Can't Keep a Good Man Down"" and ""When I Do What I Do"" get on my nerves because of the stupid hooks I just don't bother listening to them either.""Mirame mirame! I'm over here!""""Peekaboo, I see you...""Lil Rob's cool but this album is straight up garbage."
3,case partially covers screen,"I have had this case for a year.The neoprene provides good protection even when the phone is dropped.The transparent section of the case allows ez access to the keys and i have no problems pushing them. It also keeps facial oils and make-up off the keys.I love the swivel clip.I have no problems plugging the phone into the car charger.The only disadvantage is that the case moves a bit around the phone and covers some of the phone's screen. So you can NOT see the far right or left of the screen. That is, it covers the signal bars or the battery bars.If this is not important to you then I recommend this product. Personally I've had enough sliding the case around to see my signal bars and am looking for another case."
3,S.U.C 2 THE FINISH,"THIS IS A SOLID ALBUM IT'S 17 SONGS ON THIS ALBUM AND 12 ARE JAMMING, MIKE- D, REALLY STANDS OUT THIS ALBUM AND CLAY DOE IS VERY UNDERATED AS A RAPPER HE HAS SOME SKILLS, AND 3-2 ALWAYS HOLD IT DOWN.TRACK 17 HELL RAZOR IS THE BEST IT HAS LIL' KEKE,LIL'O,BIG POKEY,C-NOTE,BIG MOE,DJ-SCREW ON IT. TRACK 1 GOES HARD TO IT HAS AL-D,BIG POKEY,H.A.W.K.THIS IS WORTH BUYING BECAUSE THEY ARE SHOWING SKILLS AND YOU CAN FEEL THIS ALBUM, THEY REPRESENTED THE [MESSED] UP CLICK WELL ONCE AGIAN."
5,A Great resource for researching Spanish history,"This is a great book for researching obscure aspects of Spanish history. It is basically an encyclopedia of people and places that had to do with the Spanish Empire over the course of a few hundred years. It can be a great source of information on specific people, or it can serve as a guide to learn about the existence of other historically relevant people and places who can then be researched indendently. All in all, it was very helpful!"
2,Great Information!,"I have been in the child welfare field for over 20 years and this is one of the best books I have read for people in the field. There is a great deal of good, concrete, hands on information for those in the field that want to improve their practice. A great resource!"
2,A disappointing purchase,"This farm is fairly expensive, and we got it as the major xmas present for our son. I am not very happy with it, and my son plays with it occasionally, but it definitely isn't his favorite. Here are my gripes: 1) Very difficult to put together, which would be okay if it stayed together, but 2) It falls apart easily. So, our main activity with his toy is that my son tries to play with it, and ends up with the barn in a number of pieces, and then he calls me to help him put it back together. 3) It could use a few more animals. For the price, they could have tossed in some chickens, maybe."
4,best of the series,if you iked the firts 2 transporters strap in for the final instalment. This movie was the best of the series the car is better and even the villins are better. Best of all the detective is in the series again as well only this time he isnt trying to bust Frank. this would be a must see if you like Jason Statham.
1,Disappointing,I found this installment of the transport disappointing. Mainly because of some of the editing techniques and the actress was annoying. I also felt as though jason was bored doing this one and tired of the series.
3,Great action flick,"Another great Transporter film. Hot chicks, explosions, fist fights cool cars. Love it love it. I'm sure the feminist and tree huggers and alternative lifestyle people will hate. But to heck with those artsy fartsies. The film has great chase scenes drugs, gun fights, fist fights and a cool villians."
1,Horrid,"I really liked the first two, but this was awful. Most of the movie is horribly written dialog between the two leads that has no relevance, and the plot holes are too gaping to ignore. Consider that 1. Contracts signed under duress aren't valid and 2. There's no reason why the girl has to be transported in the first place. The occasional slip-up is tolerable in an action movie, but two reasons why the entire thing is pointless is too much. Even the above could be forgiven is there was some great action, but while (what little there was) was good, it was nothing like in the previous two movies.Oh -- one highlight was the Ukrainian textile industry. Apparently two of their cloth seat backs will stop bullets, and a dozen will protect you from an explosion powerful enough to send an ambulance ten feet in the air. I've got a high tolerance for silly action, but I couldn't take this."
3,Not bad except for the terrible villain.,"First off, many reviewers were complaining that the girl wasn't hot enough. To you I say, buy some glasses. The girl is plenty hot, and that really doesn't matter much anyway. The biggest problem with this movie is that Frank could have killed the skinny, weedy, pointless mastermind five or six times without blowing himself up, and I really wanted him to because that dude was super annoying. However, plot and story have never been the strong suit of movies like this. Explosions, fight scenes, and a touch of goofiness are, however, and this movie had plenty of those, plus they had the inspector, who I like a lot. At their best (or after you've had a few drinks) these movies are like ultra-violent Jerry Lewis films, which kind of makes sense, really, and this one falls into the ""had a few drinks"" category. Still pretty fun though!"
5,Another great Statham vehicle!,"I find it extremely difficult to not enjoy a Jason Statham movie, which is why it is no surprise that I loved Transporter 3.Jason Statham's fight sequences in this movie are just absolute fun to watch. My favorite scene is surprisingly a more quiet one, with the two main characters looking out over the scenery.Overall, this movie that rounds out the trilogy delivers just as much fun as its two predecessors. Very enjoyable, very entertaining, action packed, fantastic driving and car stunts. Nothing to not like about this movie!"
4,Transporter 3,I love Jason Statham in these movies!!!! I watched one after the other. The man definitely has swagger!!!!!! :) These movies are very unique and appeal to guys and gals a like!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the red head was more than annoying!!!!!! Transporter 1 & 2 are both 5 Star!!!
5,"Jason, Car, & Freckles","Another Statham fight sceen with extra flare. Car chase with a good story, and a leading lady with long legs and freckles. What more could you ask for in an action movie."
3,Transporter 3,"Transporter 3 was pretty good, Not as good as the previous 2 though. There could have been more thought put into the story line."
4,"Better Than 2, Not Better than 1","This movie has large shoes to fill as the first two redefined action movies. The action was outstanding. The story wasn't good at all. It wasn't until almost the end of the movie when we figured out what was going on plotwise. Also, Jason statham's attempt at comedy isn't a good one. We see at the beginning The Transporter fishing. So many things just kill the character. I found myself enjoying the movie, but it's nothing great."
2,Stateham is great fun BUT...,I've enjoyed and bought all that Jason has stared in. But his co-star Natalya Rudakova might be the most unattractive women toever star in a major motion picture. No acting skills and a look that can kill. It is hard just looking at her! Because of her I COULDN'T spend the $25.00 for the blu-ray instead I rented it and closed my eyes whenever she appeared on screen. No doubt this is her only film and hopefully her last! One only wonders who high on the food chain does she know in Hollywood to get that part?
2,Just . . . lacking,"This was a misfire for me. I love a good action movie, but this one crossed dangerously into the ridiculous, almost self-parody, at times. The love interest, who was supposed to be free-spirited and adorable, was seriously irritating. Very few of the action sequences really played to Statham's strengths--he's most convincing as a brawler or doing work with guns, not as a guy who is really good at riding a bike. The action set-pieces all came off as over-choreographed. I was glad to see the return of the detective character, but little else about this movie clicked with me. A shame to end a fun series on this note."
2,A pale sequel,"This movie shows what a good (in this case, bad) director can do for a film. Transporter 2 was great. This is a pale echo of the series' past glories. The actress is horrible, the action is cut in a jarring ""Borne"" style and there's really nothing to care about. A big disappointment."
2,"Good movie, CD is bad...","It Plays, however, sounds terrible in the drive and does not down load so I can not copy it to my Ipod. Movie was good....."
3,Good! Good!.... if there is no other movie available you like,"Great Action! Sometimes too fast. Some original stunts. Romantic part in the movie of the kind that can be left out. So, you have seen the movies you like, and cannot see the ones you want due to date or monetary limits, just pick this one. Turn of your brain and enjoy the ride! Nice car chases and stunts! If you never get to marry a red head after seeing this movie... I understand.."
2,Please Don't Do It Again!,"I generally expect sequels to be weaker than the initial film, and am usually unsurprised. Transporter 3, however, was even weaker than it should have been. Why oh why to moviemakers forget about the script when they make these things? Good car chases and special effects -- but who cares? By the end of the movie you're hoping they all die, from sheer boredom. Great action movies make us CARE about the characters -- sometimes even the bad guys. Bad action movies just have action -- like this one."
4,Stylish But Brainless Action Film,"Transporter 3 is a exactly what you think it is. It is a very good-looking action film, riddled with cliches. This time around, Jason Statham gets to karate-chop thugs working for a hood blackmailing a Ukranian politician. He kidnaps the politician's daughter (played by real life Natasha, Natalya Rudakova) to force him to allow a shipment of toxic waste into his country.Statham is forced to drive Miss Broken English of 2008 around so the cops won't find her. Like the last Transporter film, a bomb is involved. This time its strapped to Statham's wrist to keep him in the car, driving. And there is alot of driving in Transporter 3, along with explosions, shooting and many well choreographed fight scenes. All in all, Transporter 3 is a pretty much what I expected, a good but somewhat mindless diversion."
3,What happened to the rules?,"Jason Statham has made a career of being a great action star often overlooked even though he has crafted a dizzying array of movies that showcased his talent. The first Transporter was a great film that made me have faith in movies. The second was a filled with scenes that felt forced and felt like filler. The latest installment continues the story of the Transporter. I found the film to be a great addition to the series with some great action sequences but beyond that it felt a little oversimplified and forced. The plot is a stretch but intrigues none the less creating seems that are quick and sharp. His co-star was strange and was a pain in the...but I found her quite interesting. In no way shape or form did this movie delivered a worthy installment but it did it's job...it entertained. Jason, a great talent, is the only attraction that drove some to the big screen. If you are a fan of Jason or not this still provides a great, somewhat flawed, thrill ride."
2,"Weakest of the three, by far","Not nearly as good as the previous two movies, which I had really enjoyed. The plot is getting tired, and the action is predictable. The ever-reliable Statham does a good job, but just can't carry the whole movie. And the girl in the movie is so obnoxious that I would have let the bad guys kill her, and walked away with a smile."
2,A terrible disappointment.,"""You are the gay""? Come on, really? I was unaware, but apparently this question is fairly prevelent in Transporter discussion. I thought the lack of love interests was because it wasn't a necessary plot devise. After watching this film, not only is it not a necessity, but it destroys the film.Great action, great Statham, the best villain of the franchise, but I almost fell asleep watching the ""love scene"" between Frank and Freckles. I couldn't tell the difference between her bored, her excited, her high, her scared, and her horny because she sounded exactly the same, mono-toned throughout. Statham actually looked bored while she was ""seducing"" him. She was the only low point for the film, but she was in it way too much for it to still be enjoyable. I hope this doesn't ruin the series, and I really hope Robert Knepper's career isn't affected."
2,Blu-Ray Review,Worst of the 3. Totally lame script. Natalya Rudakova is no actress. She is downright terrible and ruins the movie. Blu-Ray quality is good but that's about it.
2,I liked the first two better.,"If you like an action movie and you're not too critical of the story, or the acting, give this a shot. But buy it cheap (definitely under $10), or, better yet, rent it. You're not likely to watch it again."
3,What a letdown!,"If you watch the special features, you'll find that they made this movie on a tight schedule and it looks like it. The bad guy was way too charming - not bad enough at all. The girl was such a loser. There weren't enough scenes with the French cop. Lots of special effects, but not enough of an interesting story line. Transporter 2 is still the BEST!"
3,Transporter 3 - Not as good as the first two....,"I am beginning to tire of Mr Statham's frantic rate of churning out new flicks. It's time to slow down and knock out a couple of good ones - he's a very good, capable actor in my book. True to the genre there is planty of action here and it's not a bad movie. It's just that the template is wearing a bit.All in all worth the money, but don't expect any surprises."
3,Enjoy the ride for what it is,"I think Statham can act, but with martial arts skills and a ripped bod like that, no one really cares. He is what he is and apart from the really annoying girl, this was a fun ride. The films are even able to poke fun at themselves and the fight scenes always manage to be that little bit different. The end was super if a bit silly on the bridge, the train was terrific. Frank Martin rocks! And the scenery was all gorgeous. Go figure that in an action film."
2,BORING,ALMOST FELL ASLEEP IN THE THEATRE WATCHING THIS. COOL ACTION SCENES BUT OUR HERO JUST DRIVING ENVELOPES THE FILM. DON'T BUY
5,Transponder 3,Product arrived and appears to be as promised. I have not viewed it yet but all seems to be fine.
4,Transporter 3,"Hey what can I say I like chop sockie,this movie is all right. For people that like action movies and guns and Martialarts this is the movie. Not much plot to fhe movie about same as the other too he maid . But it is a thrill ride through the movie,so if you rent or buy the movie in my opinion it was worth it."
4,"Great stunts, chases and fights","I'm new to this series. Jason Statham is a new figure to me. He has only one schtick: neutral mug at all times, hoarse whisper of all of his lines, and periodic eruptions of violence in which we see his well formed six pack in action. None of the action is the slightest bit realistic. But that's not the point. We watch because we wish we could do the supernaturally muscular things we see done on screen. Never mind the boring details of plot or script. Whatever. Think James Bond, updated. The red head co-lead is all moistly sexy, and I liked her Ukrainian accent, despite myself. The bad guys lose in the end. Does that spoil it for you? Sorry."
1,Terrible movie. Big disappointment.,"Boring, unimaginative, poorly constructed, badly written from start to finish. Was a waste of time."
1,Un-expected purchases,"I got two Movie CD's that were ""Slipped "" into my order.I don't know why I would have ordered either of them but they ended up on the order request and I was charged for them. Check your orders over very carefully to make sure what is listing is exactly what you want. I will probably never buy from Amazon again. I think they are sneaks."
4,Good Movie - BEWARE WRONG PRODUCT,"I love this movie like part 1 and 2. BUT! I ordered this movie on Blu-Ray, and got this one instead, they ""replace"" my order with no extra charge and send me the same format DVD, WTF! Amazon has gone retard."
4,Transporter 3 (Single-Disc Edition),The Transporter 3 DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition. I would definitely do business with this seller again. I gave this a rating of 4 because I wish that there was a way to combine shipping on Amazon when buying multiple items from one seller versus paying shipping on a per item basis.
3,Transporter 3,"Good movie, but again the directors can't seem to follow a conversation without injecting gross profanity. I think they believe only people with weak minds watch this."
3,Pretty good but not as good as the first two,I enjoyed the first two better than this one. I think this one moved a bit slower and was a bit boring.
2,The worst of the series,"TRANS 2 was the high-water mark for these things, so I hoped this one would be even better, but this is pretty bad. The biggest problem is there are only three hand to hand combat scenes and only one of them is a standout. I love watching Jason Statham dishing out beat-downs, so I will continue to watch the TRANS series as long as they make them, but the things we want from one of these films are simply not here: there is only ONE woman in the whole film, the car chase scenes and stunts are not that great and there should be more fighting! Simple. The plot is of the let's-start-writing-and-see-what-happens variety and too much time is wasted trying to ""get inside the mind of Frank Martin"". Next time: more hot Euro chicks and more fights!"
2,Transport this to the waste basket,This was one of those action movies that a typical teenage girl might like so they could ogle the actor on the screen but to a fan of action movies the scenes were predictable and overdone to almost imposable to say the least I just about fell asleep while watching this. The first two movies however were hard to outdo since they were done very well so the old saying is true to not put all your apples into one basket. I wouldn't be suprised in the least however if there was a fourth transporter in the future after all they are making a second crank movie just goes to show no matter how dumb the idea seems Hollywood will still produce it.
3,Good action movie,Good action movie but far less exiting than the previous two movies. Thankfully I bought is used for less money but it is in excellent condition.
5,I Didn't Think I Was A Sports Fan Till I Picked Up This Book,"I recently took a friend to a doctor's appointment and this book was in the collection of waiting room reading material. So I picked it up, thinking what the heck and discovered an entire chapter is devoted to stories about Ali. Well, let me tell you, I was instantly hooked. When my friend returned to the waiting room, instead of being relieved to be out of there, I was actually disappointed to not be able to finish one of the stories. So, I went right out and bought my own copy. The story on Joe DiMaggio is splendid. I never knew much about Ted Williams, but sure do now after reading the terrific story by Richard Ben Cramer . What a great read this book is. It is excellent. You don't have to be a jock to enjoy it. The collection is some of the best writing I've had the pleasure to read this year."
3,Back in college,"The author of this book knows so much, it seems, he can't get it all into his book.Without having a firm foundation in early Andean culture, I found this book challenging to digest. It moves through historical terminology at a mind-warping rate. On the other hand, after ""stepping back"" to read more basic books on the same subject, I realize I've gotten a strong platform of knowledge from Von Hagen. I recommend you read this book only if you plan to read others on the topic, too."
4,Satisfactory,I use 1500 w model at a %40 rate. So far so good. My european stuff works very well. I think it is advisable to chose the capacity so as to have a utilization of max 70%.
3,2,TERIMA KASIH SAJALAH KERANA SUDI MEMBERI SEDIKIT KATA UCAP YANG TAK SEBERAPA INI.SEKIAN TERIMA KASIH.
3,Great Concept - Avg Follow-through,"The sleek design definitely add's character to the phone. It increases the general size dimensions, which can sometimes help being that the phone is already so small. One difficult thing I found though was that the keypad seemed less accessible because of it's bulkiness, but the belt-clip is a definite benefit. The phone will also rattle when it's on vibrate mode."
3,Not as magnificent as the move but not bad,"Had much the same reaction to this as I did to ALL the movie sequels: the very obvious one of 'Okay, but not a patch on the original.' (And not to even consider 'The Seven Samurai').On the other hand if you'd been living in a cave for the last forty years and had no landmark original to compare it with, the series would be pretty good. Worth a look,anyway: well shot etc. The 4:3 was a bit disappointing; wasn't this made in the widescreen era?).Certainly the characters have been given their little quirks but, again comparing the series to the original movie, nobody has the killer edge...it's the pretend violence of little boys playing cowboys.In fact, these blokes look like they've been rounded up around the studio and the director has said 'Right: this week we're doing a western.'Verdict: fine for a wet Sunday afternoon. Far better to get yourself the new 2-disc version of the original movie. Now THAT's worth the time and money, in spades."
4,The Magnificent Seven - The Complete First Season,I enjoyed this very much. I found it very entertaining and a very good escape from everyday life.
5,Amazon Has This One Messed Up,"Magnificent Seven: Complete First Season was not filmed in 1960 and did not star Yul Brynner. What's being released is a DVD of the CBS series from 1998 which starred Michael Biehn from The Terminator, Ron Perlman from Beauty and the Beast, Hellboy, and Eric Close from Without a Trace.Hope Amazon corrects this soon."
4,Overrated?,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Magnificent Seven series when it first aired in 1998. The first season, in my opinion, held the best episodes. The cast definately defined magnificence, and they really interacted well with each other. Some of the episodes were great, some of the plots were a bit cheesy and unbelievable. [hence i feel that the show is overrated though delightful.] It definately was worth watching, you will be fond of the actors, but it is not the best tv show ever by a long shot. I think the classics such as rawhide, big valley, high chaparral should not be overlooked!"
5,Have Moicy!,"SRV Returns! My stereo melted from the soul put forth on this cd!Hopefully the young guns of today do not take it for granted, hell they should bathe in the power and beauty of one of americas greatest guitar players.11 years later he is still passionately missed on a level akin to Elvis.This cd gives fuel to that fire. Every song a testament, every phrase a glimpse into the mind of a master who left us way too soon.Hell just go and buy it. You wont be let down........."
1,Disappointed,"This CD was a Birthday gift for my brother. When I pushed play the CD skipped on several songs. Birthday present was ruined. This is the second time and last time I will ever buy anything from Amazon. Thie first time I purchased something it was through a seller on Amazon. A DeMarcus Ware Dallas Cowboy T-Shirt. I paid with a credit card and never received the shirt. I contacted Amazon vie email and was put in touch with the seller, he said he'd do a search. Never heard anything from him again and never got the the shirt. Amazon is NOT where I'll ever go again."
5,Amazing - Nicely Put Together,"Hats off to Jimmie for tastefully adding to the SRV catalog. This album is a true treat for any SRV fan. The story has been well told about how SRV & DT went to the Montreux Blues Festival as was boo'ed. Afterwards David Bowie approached Stevie to play on the Let's Dance album and Jackson Browne offered the band free use of his LA studio, which produced their masterful debut album 'Texas Flood'. This frist disc is from the 1982 set and it is amazing. The second disc sees the band returning in 1985, but this time to cheering fans. This disc and many of the songs are on Alive Live. It's great to comapre and contrast the two shows and see how they had evolved during that time period. It's great that more material has been made available to the public from his early days. The CD is nicely put together with great pictures and liner notes. This is a great addition to any SRV collection and an excellent way to get to know Stevie for first timers."
5,Stevie Ray Vaughan--what else is there?,"Essential for any SRV lover's collection. Stevie played every note like it could be his last. Even through the boos in 1982 he was determined and played his heart out. By 1985 he was celebrated for the true blues musician that he was. Stevie deserves 5 stars for every song he did. Even if one doesn't particularly like a certain song, you have to appreciate his passion, and that's definately worth 5 stars!"
2,nah,I was expecting more. I just wasn't impressed withthis divinatory method. The pieces feel cheaply made and the messagesdon't convey any real insight into the situation.
1,Misfiled under a set when it was just a book.,"I was highly disappointed with this order. The seller filed this product under a set which was supposed to include 30 scarabs, not just a book. It was just the book. Now I have the book but no scarabs. Useless."
4,Better than Cornwell,Goldberg kept me on the edge of my seat! I like this book for so many reasons that i can't state them. Thought this was better tha Cornwell.
5,Top Indy horror.,"One of the best independent IFC produced horror films of recent years, truly unsettling flick. Thought it was short on extras though."
1,Not here yet,"I would love to rate this product but it has not come yet, it has been a week since they took my money, it is not like they had to go to the jungle and pick the ingredients bring them back mix it together then jump on a horse and deliver it to me. Every item I have ever ordered on Amazon has been at my house about 3 days after they received my money. Maybe I am spoiled, I am just real anxious to dye my hair."
1,I wasted my money,"This book needs to be edited - badly. It's very difficult to read. Sentences a page apart contradict each other.The author repeatedly claims that these techniques are simple and mechanical but they seem to me to be just the opposite. I found them very difficult to understand and he allows so much variation in the parameters that the interpretation becomes very subjective.Worse, he explains a technical indicator and cites specific parameters and then goes on to point out that the reader may want to vary these parameters all over the place! Excuse me, sir, but I thought that was why you did all the research - to figure out what the proper parameters were. If you tell me that I need to experiment with them then why do I need your book?"
2,"Possibly good, but nearly incomprehensible writing style.","DeMark is a noted, productive author. He has at least one other book and numerous articles in Futures magazine to his credit. Some of his methods for trading do not require computer power to use, just price charts.His writing, however,is insufferable. Faults include the following:Verbosity: On page 16 I found a sentence with over 90 words, followed at once by another one even longer. I have three college degrees, but I want to be taught, not challengd.Failure to Verify: This man comments unfavorably on other mehods, but fails to present any data on how well his suggestions have worked in tests.Repetition: His copyrighted TD Sequential method appears in both his books and in Futures Magazine as well. Other methods cited in this book are found in recent Futures articles as well.Annoying Egoism: I remember who developed the ideas, without preceding each name with ""TD."""
5,The author is a genius!!,"I have only read the 1st half of the is book and really can't put it down for fear I miss assimilating some imporant trading morsel. Although the fact that thee are no hard-coded finalized systems in the book is a deficiency, the ideas the author has expressed has been worth their wieght many times over in gold. I am an engineer by training and I find the author's english compsotion a little taxing but the ideas revolutionary. I highly recommend!"
1,Robina,Did not receive this book. Where is it. I'm very annoyed. Mayb you can do something about thisRobina Asti
1,This is a copy of software flyer to me.,This book is software flyer. The differences is that most flyers are free. This one you have to pay to read the flyer. Don't waste your time and money on it. There's very good trading psychology book that you you don't want to miss---What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars. The author of the book is a registered seller @ Amazon.com. Buy from him through Amazon. You will love this book if you are a serious trader and want to be successful. Guaranteed. Best luck trading to everyone.
5,One of the best books on the subject,"I like to read about various trading techniques. I also attend seminars. My conclusion from 20+ years of doing both is that nobody is going to share with a reader for the cost of a book a trading system that is highly successful. that was until I read this book. Although there is no straight forward formula in the book that delineates a profitable trading system, I truly believe some of the writer's methods are capable of being turned into profitable systems. I guess the old adage is true that if someone wanted to hide something of value then place it in the eyes of the public and they won't realize its true value there."
1,Completely Dessapointed,"The first book of DeMark was good but this one is not a book, is like some manual for some software. All indicators are copyrighted, so you have to use one of the charting software indicated and even doing that you don't have access to the code.You can't write your own for the software are you using or modify some because there is no formulas explained.Is like to buy a car and you can't see inside the engine, touch them, stripping, etc. You only can drive.It's shame, a complete waste of time and money.At the begging he mention Larry Williams. I suppose if Larryit had kept the Williams %R formula in the secret he would be one of the most popular traders known.The dumb trader: pays for a profits promise when buying something, and indicator, an expert, a system.The smart trader says: before pay, show me the profits an then we see."
5,Exceptional analytics,I oversee major international bank trading desks. We use these tools to optimize our trading timing. Our results have improved immensely since these unique timing devices been installed. We know that central banks use them as well on Bloomberg terminals. We demand all traders learn them.
2,Just an observation,"I looked at all the recent 5 star ratings to see what other books these people have reviewed. Guess what! The only books they have reviewed are this one or other DeMark books... This is an important point and not at all a frivolous comment. For the newbie to Amazon: You need to know if the reviewer is a friend, cohort, or other vested interest, or a genuine end user writing about his/her experience. One way to get an idea is to look at what they review. Also, is the review specific and does it criticize as well as praise?"
1,Does not work,"This review is short: I bought the book, I tested the systems, the systems did NOT work, I sold the book.Maybe these systems worked sometime in the past. But not anymore."
3,strict!!,"I found this book to have some great points about how parents are in charge and children should not run the household. I believe that children need and want boundaries and limits to feel safe and loved. However, I found the author's tone to be overly strict and a little oppressive for the children."
5,Works Well,We used it in some brown sugar that was already pretty dry and after a day it was like new again.
5,Really does work,First had bought this as a gift and got such good reviews so ended up buying one for my self
5,Brown sugar bear,Now that I am older I really enjoy spoiling myself with pretty cooking gadgets. I would have never afforded these when I was young
5,It works!!,"This little bear really does soften brown sugar! Since my brown sugar was essentially a collection of sugar ""rocks"", I had to re-soak the bear after a week to continue the process. After the second time, most of the sugar returned to original consistency. I am so pleased with this sugar bear, I bought a second and intend to buy more to give to others. Great product!"
4,Does a good job,"I had no idea that there was a way to keep your brown sugar from clumping up, but my wife wanted this so what the heck. First of all the pacakaging is very cheap and when my amazon box came the bear had escaped the package and was loose in the box. The size is about the size of a sugar cookie and bigger than what i expected. It also seemed kind of flimsy. However all of this is moot because the bear does what it is designed to do and it takes moisture out of the air and keeps the brown sugar loose and not clumpy. I have already bought several bears as gifts."
5,A cute little magician,"I have used a brown sugar disk for years but the Brown Sugar Bear is a little thicker and heavier, works much better and is so cute. It is amazing. I put it in a container of brown sugar that I had to break into pieces. It was not ""hard as a rock"" but close. The next morning it was soft and easy to pack. I also keep one in a container of raisins and one in the Craisins. I purchased twelve and gave 6 to family. Now I have to decide where to use the other three."
5,works well,"I used it to soften up brown sugar which tends to get compressed in the bottom of the jar and is impossible to use in that state. this really worked great, soaked it for 20 minutes in water and then just placed it in the jar with the sugar."
4,Soak the little guy in water first.,"This is totally user error, but I broke up my clumpy hard brown sugar and dropped the bear in. A week later, my sugar was hard as a ROCK and I had to use an ice pick to break it up and free the bear again. Google taught me that I was supposed to soak the bear in water first, THEN put it in the sugar. I've done that now and hopefully my sugar will come back to life. It would have been nice if this important tidbit was somewhere on the packaging..."
3,It is ok,Brown sugar still got hard. Not sure if it was too hard when I added this little guy. Would I buy again? Meh....
5,Really works,"A presoaked bear restored a bag of rock hard brown sugar to perfect consistency. Will never have brown sugar without one of these. It did ship with some clay dust in the bag, so I did wash mine first."
1,Not Worth Purchasing,"The author admitted at the beginning of the book that he wrote it in a short period of time, in fact, before the autopsy report was released. There is nothing new in this book. I believe it was written quickly before interest in Terri Schiavo faded and with hope that it would become another Murder in Greenwich, but I doubt that anything will come of it. If you must read it out of curiosity, rent it from your public library or get it from someone who already spent too much for it."
2,Don't waste your money.....,"Yes, he said he wrote this book in a hurry. I believe him. He was so redundant with information; it seemed he was repeating himself over and over just to fill a book."
1,Not qualified to make an ethical decision or medical decision,Mark Furman cab be a brilliant detective but he is not a medical examiner. This is the same guy who almost imediately solved the OJ murder case while at the same time being shown to be a racist by his previous interview. One big plus and one big minusresulting in a not guilty verdict. Mark has been shown to be a liability in anything involving ethics. He can add nothing to the Terry Schiavo story.
3,Terri Shiavo's untold story.,Interesting book being so topical. Much information was repeated in a different form throughout the book.The book did not provide the whole story eg Postmortem report not available. Maybe this was to necessitate a sequel.My lasting memory was how the husband got away with so much for a long time.Different legal system to NZ.
3,What Actually Caused Terri Schiavo's 1990 Collapse?,"As public interest in Terri Schiavo largely seemed to fade after the release of the 2005 autopsy report, I was able to pick this book up for a mere dollar. After reading it, I still do not know why Terri Schiavo collapsed in 1990. After that collapse and a 1992 medical malpractice judgment, however, I remain convinced that she was treated in a morally repugnant manner by her husband."
1,REVISIONIST HISTORY,Mark Fuhrman who has no expertise as a medical investigator nor any first hand knowledge of the Terri Schiavo case has written a work of fiction that contradicts the reality of the tragic situation exploited by the radical right wing nut cases in this nation. It is amazing that the Wm. Morrow Corporation would even publish such a revisionist history that is not supported by the facts such as the official autopsy. The first clue that the book is fiction comes with the admission that Sean Hannity asked the author to write this piece of trash. Sean Hannity himself throughout the whole sordid tragedy of the Terri Schiavo case nightly showed no respect for the facts when he stated his opinions on the theatrics which were an assault on common sense and decency. Anyone who wastes their money in purchasing this fictional account is obviously a fool.
1,Day Late and a Dollar Short Mark Fuhrman!,"Regretfully, ""Silent Witness"" depicts how someone with Mark Fuhrman's reputation comes to a tragic scene after the FACT....just to make a BUCK!If you sincerely want to learn more about the Terri Schiavo case..save your money on this one....and....read some of the other books published that show the indisputable documentation and facts."
1,Fiction,"This is largely a book of innuendo, speculation and fiction. It's enough to make one wonder if Michael Skakel is innocent."
4,Compelling,Fuhrman's book is effective because he carefully avoids makingany extravagant claims. He makes a strong circumstantial casethat Terry Schiavo's husband knows more than he's telling abouther initial collapse. What I don't understand is how anyoneintelligent enough to write this book could have been dumb enough to perjure himself in the Simpson case.
4,Intersting approach,This book exposed a lot of information not previously published. It was an interesting approach to investigate after the fact and apply information to draw various conclusions for the reader to select. It is not subjective in its conclusions but raises different questions based on the facts that were exposed during the authors investigation. Most of the conclusions are left up to the reader based on the facts exposed. A good book.
2,Don't bother with this book,"I read Mr. Furhmann's book (it was a very quick read), but I had developed an opinion about Michael Shiavo long before this. The book merely gives speculation as to what ""might have"" happened in 1990 to Terri Shiavo and really doesn't shed much new light on the case. Putting into print that Michael Shiavo is a first-rate jerk is something that was quite evident when Terri's case first became public knowledge. This book really has nothing new to add, except that the initial accident/incident wasn't followed up properly by the police in 1990. If this had been done, there may have been a different ending to this extremely sad story."
2,Another exploitation,The case itself is fascinating and unresolved the facts remain the same as was/is the outcome. Furmhan on the otherhand is making a very good living exploiting murder. He seems to be forming a pattern here.
5,Well worth reading........,"Mark Fuhrman tells it like it is, and leaves it up to the reader to draw their own conclusions. I always thought Michael Schiavo was fueled by spite, and money, now I am convinced."
1,How does this author sleep at night?,"If I could have given lower than a one star I would have. The suffering of this poor girl is over, the autopsy report is in, the case is closed. Can't you let her rest in peace? Dear lord, what more suffering do you want from this family, from her husband? Hasn't enough damage been done?A previous reviewer wrote: 'Isn't that kind of why people write books anyway? Just an observation...' No actually its not. Its usually because they have something to write that they want to share with others (if its fiction) or they have a bit of history or a point to make. Then there are the jerks who see dollar signs. This could be the only reason for this book."
3,Nice swivel clip -- bad case,"Unlike what some reviewers have said I found the swivel clip to be about the coolest thing about this case. The swivel clip is solid and works well. The case itself was nice at first although it didn't quite fit the phone (a Nokia 5165). Also, although there was a hole at the bottom to attach an external earphone, there was no hole at the bottom to attach a charger. Still, it worked pretty well until after about six months of use the neoprene started to rip and shred. Now it's very shredded around the power button and microphone. So I guess I am going to try a leather case although it's not easy to find a leather case with a swivel clip or a leather case that fit's the 5165 anymore. They say the phone's out of date. Oh well."
5,Body Glove Cell Phone Case,"After I bought my Nokia, I purchased the standard Nokia leather case w/belt clip, but this case was bulky (about doubling the width of the phone) and it was difficult to remove from belts that were fairly thick. This cell phone case, on the other hand, had everything I was looking for. A cover for the LCD and keypad, water and shock resistance, plus its snug design keeps the phone ""portable"" without adding unneeded bulk.I also purchased a similar type of case for my Palm handheld a year ago, and I was sold on its durability and reliability, so when I saw this cell phone case made out of the same material, I knew that I had a quality product that would do what it was supposed to. This is a quality product that will protect your investment for a reasonable cost."
1,Cellsuit swivel belt clip,"The neoprene case is nice, BUT the belt clip is garbage. It is 100% light plastic and breaks if it touches or rubs agaist anything while you have it clipped to your belt. the manufacturer needs to make a metal clipping version because the plastic one is too light and breaks EXTREMELY EASILY! I have been through 3 in a week and will not spend anymore $ on them."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...........,"I bought this case less than two months ago, and the ""swivel"" belt clip is already broken off. This product is the biggest piece of garbage I ever bought. They should construct something more durable for everyday use. The case itself is very difficult to slip the phone into and is not a perfect fit by any means. Save your money or buy another brand."
5,Very Happy with the HP 912,"I've been very happy with this purchase. The 2.5 Mega pixels are just fine for printing 5x7 prints, and 8x10's if you set the picture up well. The features of the camera are many, the automatic ones work great and there are overrides on almost all of the auto ones. I take up close ""macro"" pictures a lot and was thinking about getting a ring flash, but so far I've been pretty happy with the built in flash lighting up my subject... This feature and two others are why I would recommend this. You can set the ASA from 25 up to 400 (a lot of other cameras have one setting 100). The other feature is the compact flash memory, they work well and I feel they're very reliable."
3,"Good looking case, Poor design","In my opinion this case fails in some very important characteristics:Pros:-looks pretty nice-Durable and resistent-less expensive than otherscons:- 8260 does not fit well. There is not holes for accesesories so you will have to make them by your own. You cannot attach a handsfree, for example.- belt clip is somehow small. At the beginning it seems to be good but once you use it you realize that its size is not apropriate.You better go for a case designed specifically for 8260 or whatever phone you have."
2,Too Bulky,"Although I really liked the material this case was made out of, it was almost impossible to get the case on the phone. If you actually got the case on, the power button is near impossible to use. The clip hardly stays on anything, and the case simply makes this phone too bulky to deal with. I personally bought the 8290 because it was sleek and small, and this case just ruins any sleekness the Nokia had."
5,Awesome Camera!,"Recently purchased this camera after returning the Kodak 3500. What a difference! The features,quality and construction are amazing. Took the camera on vacation to the beach and it performed beautifully. Brought back 70 Pictures and they were better than ever before! Took all of those pictures on the batteries that came with the camera. Comes with an excellent set of Photo Batteries from Energizer.I took a rechargeable set and never had to use them. Haven't been brave enough to try the camera on manual yet but I will. Took along My laptop so I had somewhere to unload the pics, which is a breeeze. Highly recommended camera!!"
5,Excellent Camera,"This is my first Digital Camera and I am very impressed. I took the camera to Europe for 6 weeks. It was easy to upload the pictures to my Laptop and email them to friends. I took over 225 pictures and only changed the rechargeable batteries once. When I got home, I printed some of the pictures using an HP 1215 printer and as I was told ""They look like a Postcard."" The camera was easy to use and I used all of the default settings. The zoom was great and it work like a point and shoot."
3,Can't get started with you!,"I live in England and my daughter sent me this camera from California, in May. ... So far I have one image in the computer. ... Taking photos was fine - though the viewfinder is poor compared with my SLR. But they just would not load - nothing but error messages - Can't recognise the file type - Jpeg, for heaven's sake - and eventually, corrupted files. Meanwhile the batteries were flat, so bought a charger and batteries and a new card. With these I actually got a photo in the computer, Now I am looking for an AC adapter - hard to find over here. Apart from all the hassle, it looks like a nice camera, and I hope to use it some time. Negotiating the menus is a bit tricky - my fingers are too big for the little buttons. But it will go in my pocket, which my Canon won't. my rating is provisional - I haven't really used this camera."
1,E. Muhammad's book is not recommended for orthodox Muslims,"The book is well written and features useful advice. However, orthodox Muslims should beware that the teachings of the prolific Elijah Muhammad are not in tandem with the Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him) and mainstream Islam.Author biodata: Muhammad, Elijah (1897-1975), American black Muslim, who was leader of the Nation of Islam, or black Muslims, from 1934 until his death. He was born near Sandersville, Georgia. In 1923 he settled in Detroit, where, eight years later, he met and became a disciple of Walli Farad, founder of the Temple of Islam in Detroit. When Farad disappeared in 1934, Muhammad assumed leadership of the movement, which grew and prospered, especially in the 1960s, surviving a rift between Muhammad and his disciple Malcolm X."
4,Not bad for what you pay.,"I guess they are a decent product for the price. The directions are poor quality; parts are numbered incorrectly in text and picture but it was easy to figure out by the picture, plus there are words cut/pasted into the middle of a section that are clearly out of order. A couple of parts had blank stickers where the numbers should have been. One rail's netting is very tight and took a lot of force to put together, the other side is kind of flimsy and has movement even when fully assembled. Overall a lack of quality assurance and they could have saved me some wasted time if they proofread the instructions.Unfortunately our box spring isn't high enough to clear the wooden frame and it makes folding the rail under difficult. It will likely lead to damage to the wood frame the way the bottom rails rubs against the wood. Do not get this product unless the gap between your mattress and box spring is higher than your wooden bed frame."
5,Keeps the little guy from rolling out of bed,"My three year old recently moved into a full size bed. We ordered the double sided bed rail to keep him from rolling out of bed - he tends to roll around a lot in his sleep. This set was fairly easy to put together, although you do need to pay attention to the directions. His mattress has a pillow top and these bed rails still stand up far enough past the edge of the mattress to keep him in the bed. I have had no problems raising and lowering the sides to change sheets. The rails under the mattress do make the middle of the mattress bump up a little, but it's not that noticeable and has not affected our son's ability to sleep on the mattress. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who needs a double sided bed rail."
1,Junk,"The sides lean in toward the sleeping toddler at a VERY pronounced angle (not the way it is shown in the photo at all). The rails that are supposed to go between the mattresses are HUGE and actually caused our twin matress to slip around and off of the boxed springs below because it held it up so much. The straps are extremely long, needing to be ""tucked"" in the gaping hole it makes between the matress and boxed spring, and leaving ""ropes"" for my son to wrap around himself. The one we were sent had a manufacturing defect in even being able to assemble it (bent/tight metal sliding mechanisms). The ""fabric"" was cheap and neon hospital white. One side barely stretched over the rickety frame... the other side had plenty of noticable slack. We returned it almost immediately. Amazon was very good about the return."
2,Pain in the a**,"This product is frustrating and difficult to assemble from beginning to end. I am very mechanically inclined so it's not me. The instructions suck & once the thing is installed properly, it doesn""t sit right on the box spring because of 4 protrusions on the bottom rails. With that being said, it was functioning ok for 3 weeks & then my 2-1/2 yr. old broke the zipper that holds the mesh to the sides with minimal effort. It is now in the back of his closet..."
2,"Works Fine, But Construction Is Junk","These work fine to keep your child from falling out of bed, but don't try to change the sheets or put the rails down.The construction is absolute junk. I'd imagine that if they spent $7 manufacturing this item instead of $5, they would have a much better product. The rails always get cockeyed, and it is impossible to slide the rail in or out without a fight. The tolerances are abysmal.However, once you have this installed and the rails are up, it does a fine job keeping your child from falling out. The feature allowing you to lower the rails is close to worthless."
3,Slide away side rails,"we wanted two side rails for a guest bed where our grandson sleeps. Unfortunately the guest bed is a platform style and the track mechanisms wouldn't fit as their was no box spring/foundation so the rails could be slid between the box spring and mattress. We ended up purchasing a 5"" foundation to raise the mattress and installed the unit. Not that straight forward to do, lifting the mattress and orienting the rails with the right spacing, etc. but we got it. They work as advertised and we can now unlock them and slide them under the mattress or pull them out and lock them up. If you don't have foundation and mattress check to make sure you'll be able to fit these under a mattress and have a stable surface with clearance on the sides."
3,Hard to use!,I do daycare and have to have side rails on all my beds ! Sometimes they pull out and go in easy enough and other time I have to satuggle to get them out and end!
5,Great product!,"Great product, fairly easy to assemble, works well, even with my tall mattress! Rails slide under the mattress to hide when not in use or when making bed, but be careful - the metal frame parts still protrude a bit."
1,Bed HIde Away Guard,"I just bought this guard on the 14th August, but it is already heading for the rubbish dump. The product is extremely poorly made and when my 3 year old son leaned against the side the metal bent at the joint.The other thing that was very frustrating about this item was that when it was under the mattress it did not slide in or out easily. Even with the anchor straps the joints did not line up and you also struggled to pull out or put in the supporting holding pin into the supporting slot. When you did get the pin through the slot there was a gap between where the slot came out and where it met the supporting upright. Very unstable and scary to think that your child will be able to knock it out during the night.I would not recommend this item to anybody and it is just a waste of time and money. I would not be surprised if it was made in China.I have tried to include a few photographs of the problem areas as well, but Amazon does not offer that option.[...]"
2,Even if it is CHEAP it is NOT worth the trouble.,"Spare yourself the trouble and pay $10 more for the Summer double rails. I NEVER write reviews but want to warn you that the Regalo rails have TERRIBLE instructions, is difficult to assemble, with cheap mesh and is very short. There are TOO many components in assembling this item and when you pull the mesh to attach to the poles, the sides start to rip. When assembled and placed under the full mattress, there is only about six inches of safety and if you have an active baby they can easily fall off the sides.If you have a twin bed, then perhaps the rails will do a better job.I purchased this item wanting to save money but have learned my lesson. I am going to order the SUMMER rails which we purchased for my daughter but cost $10 more. The Summer rails assemble in 5 minutes with a handful of steps and is extremely safe and durable."
2,Bummer,The downfall for this item is that if you have a high mattress it isn't very high. It is also hard to put up.
2,Very Frustrating,"I do not love these as some reviewers have. These are are the third type of bedrails (fourth child) my family has used. I would have paid extra to have them come put together. There is no reason for this to come in so many pieces. The directions have mistakes in them. Now that they are on the bed, I am worried about all the metal that is in between the mattress and box springs. I can't get them adjusted to where there is not metal sticking out when the rails are folded down. That worries me for times when my daughter or other children will be playing in her room. I will give it a week or so but I have feeling these will be going when I can find something else."
1,This Product is terrible,The engineering on this product is a disgrace. The instructions for assembly are incomplete and the the parts are not lableled or marked as they should be. When we called the customer service number they were vague and unhelpful.I suggest you reconsider buying this product. My entire experience was awful.
1,"Small, A PAIN to assemble, Not worth the money!","The side rails are much smaller than I expected! I should have reviewed the dimensions more carefully! I am not convinced the ""locking"" system is worth anything! And this thing was a pain to put together! Some steps are overly detailed and others appear to be missing vital information. There are sentences that are not proper English and make no sense at all. In conclusion, the construction is cheap!"
5,I Love it,This very good quality bed rail. It took me 15 minute to assemble without even looking the instructions. It is long enogh and strong enough even for an adult. My daughter love it.
4,Worth the money,"Purchased this product for our 2 yr old daughter who has just transitioned into a full size bed. Easy to assemble, however, you will need some strength to get one of the bars to fit together.Rails are sturdy when upright and easily slide underneath the bed when not in use. The bars do still slightly stick out when you have the rails stowed. You can't notice under a bedspread, however, just watch your knees/shins when making the bed.This is the 3rd system we have purchased with dissatisfaction with the others. Overall- This product was the easiest to assemble and sturdiest."
4,A decent product,"A decent product, but as mattresses in the US seem to be quite high, I was surprised to see that it only came up a little over each side of the mattress i.e. less than I would have liked. EIther way it seems to do what it was intended for, which is all tha matters."
2,Doesn't work on all mattresses,"We have a deep mattress and in the ad it stated it worked. I went to install it and it stuck up from the mattress about 2"". The kid would roll right over it. No Good."
3,"ADEQUATE, WITH A FEW CAVEATS","After getting it installed, it is strong and I feel confident it will not move. The problem is that getting it installed was not that easy, and when in use with a pillowtop mattress or an extra thick mattress, the rails are only about six inches above the top of the mattress. I don't plan on using the ""hideaway"" feature since I don't think the product can take the daily breakdown."
4,Serves its purpose!,Frame seems pretty sturdy. Mesh helps in rigidity. Fairly easy to fold down. We leave them up most of the time on 2 year old's bed. Two year old has laid against it and it has withstood her. Middle member connection could have been designed a little better.
4,"a little difficult to use, but overall a good product","We use this on our bed where we put our baby during the day for his naps. The product works as advertised and it really does slide between the mattress and box spring, and is not noticeable at all when we're sleeping on the bed. The negative is that the catches which lock the gates into place can be a bit of a pain to line up correctly and putting the gates up and down sometimes takes longer than it should, which is a pain for us since it goes up and down every day."
2,too many pieces,I thought my husband would have a heart attack when he saw how many pieces the product had. I would have not purchased it had I known. Also...It does not flip all the way down like others I had bought years ago.
3,They work for what we want,"The value of these bed rails compared to others we considered, was excellent!However we didn't think that our platform bed from ikea would be a problem. Make sure your mattress raises above your side bed boards, if any.We're still able to wedge them in there but the mattress is not laying completely flat. We're not able to use the sliding benefit because of this problem.The reason why we rated this a 3 because some of the metal was bent and they don't fold easily. Also, one of the middle rails slides/pops out easily. The bed rails were sort of warped!"
3,Good but difficult to put together...,"The parts are all easy but the instruction manual stinks! It was difficult to put together by myself and I needed my husband's help as the mesh really had to be stretched. Otherwise, once the final product is complete, it's pretty easy to use and secure."
3,barnes,Its not so easy to put down to hide them. i mostly keep em up all the time. have to fight with them to get them down..
3,Got a returned product,"I was very disappointed to find when I opened the box I could tell this product had been returned to Amazon and they sold it to me. The inside box was not sealed and the plastic ties around the bars had been cut. One of the bars was bent and would not fit in the proper hole(which is probably the reason it was returned in the first place) I was finally able to connect the bar after prying and prying to make it fit.The product is overall a good product, it took hardly any time to put together after I had the trouble with the bent piece. It is nice that the bars hide under the mattress, it does take a few minutes to collapse to fit under the mattress but worth it in my book."
1,Do NOT BUY,Please read the other negative reviews. This product came broken. It would have been difficult to put together and was obviously cheaply made.
2,doesn't fit if the matress is below the side of the bed,"This looks to be a sturdy rail, but it won't fit if the matress fits inside of the bed frame. Plus, the entire set had to be assembled. Now that I know it will not work with the bed I have to sell it somewhere else and I can't return it."
5,great!,i use these on my king bed. i co-sleep with my son and they are perfect. i dont have to worry about him falling or rolling off. now to get him to not climb over :p
1,Broke on it's 3rd night!!!,"The bed rails we purchased broke on the 3rd night! I couldn't believe it! A piece of thin metal bent when i was trying to pull out the rails. then, when i was going to take off the rail to see if I could bend it back into place, the fastener that holds the straps in place flew off! I was very disappointed and wished I had purchased something different!"
5,Safety side for kids bed,Bought this for my son going into big boy bed.Great price. Easy install. Has never fallen out of bedWith this product. Durable. Still looks like new after over a year use.
4,Customer service is a plus,We have not used this bed rail much as it is on a spare bed but it seems sturdy and we have not identified any problems with it so far.I do want to commend Regalo on their customre service. One of the spring loaded tabs that hold the rail in an upright position was not working right when we put the rails together. I emailed the company and received a respone within 2 hours. I explained the issue and they asked which part was defective and sent out a replacement. The newpart snapped right into place and is working perfectly.The ease with which we got the replacement part was refreshing in an era where I have come to expect bad customer service. I would certainly purchase from Regalo again.
3,This broke early a clock,Though serving its purpose it broke early a clock so the flipping down and sliding under the matress is not functional anymore. My son crawls out of the bed at the foot of the bed.Shipping was quick and packaging was good.
3,does the job,Our mattress is thick so these barely go over the sides but they do the job. Fit on our king size bed fine width wise. Good price.
4,Exactly what we needed,"We were looking for bed rails to install at my mother's house over the holidays. These were perfect and made my 3 year old very comfortable sleeping in a fairly tall full size bed (he normally sleeps in a low to the ground toddler bed). The only downside is that they can be a little bit difficult to put together for some people. I had no problem doing so, but neither of my parents were able to install them prior to our visit."
2,"It will do, but it's not the best","This product was easy to assemble according to my husband, but the brackets that hold the sides up bent easily and still do not fit right so that the rail is not totally in place, but enough to keep my toddler from falling out of the bed."
4,Sturdy and useful,"Overall this is a good buy. The only bad thing that I found about this was that, it was sratchng and damaging the underside of my sons bunk bed due to its metal construction. I had to put my own padding between the elbow of this side rail and my sons bed to prevent further damage."
2,Very time-consuming to put together,"The quality of the product is ok, but it took a good 2 hours to put together, mainly because the last part was so tricky. The directions were not well-illustrated and the written part was very confusing. I bought the Summer Infant Sure and Secure Double Bedrail, which comes already put together, and it was worth the few dollar difference in price. Safety-wise and sturdiness wise, they seem to be about the same."
4,Sturdy but assembly is tough,"The product works good once assembled. Good length for a queen size bed.Assembly was very hard. May be it was the unit if got, took about 2.5 hours.Good price in my opinion. Next time I`d rather pay more but not have the hassle with assembly"
3,Good for the price,"I have the extra long and tall version of this product, and the durability is completely different (the extra long ones are much better, no complaints). I had some difficulty with putting together one of the sides, the other one was easy. I really like that they slide right under the mattress for when guests are over, the beds look nice and neat, they work like they are suppose to, but at times i have trouble with the locking pins, and the sleeve where the strap feeds through already broke, it's not really a big deal, i'm happy with them."
2,"It works, sort-of?","This rail works, it easily slides under the mattress. That part is nice. The knobs you use to release the rails are not nice. They are very cheap, they are spring loaded and feel like they are going to break when you use them. You have to keep releasing the knobs several times while putting the rail down because they just pop out again. If your going to use this rail for quite a while, get a better version."
3,"Great, but time assembly is time consuming","Great product, however, it definitely took an hour + to assemble. The rails will not hideaway on the type of bed frame we have for our daughter. Lastly, making the bed is pretty difficult, there is not enough room on the sides to lay the comforter down so we have to kind of tuck it under."
1,Regalo double sided bed rail,HORRIFIC...DON'T BUY!!! TAKES OVER AN HOUR TO PUT TOGETHER ONE SIDE AND YOU R LUCKY IF THE SIDE WORKS PROPERLY!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White
1,Hard to assemble / Difficult to follow Instructions,"This product is hard to assemble and the instructions that come with it is terrible. If you assemble it incorrectly, due to poor instructions, you may end up breaking something. In my case, I broke one of the pins and did not have the patience to either ask for a refund or an exchange. This manufacturer needs to learn how to write instruction manuals from IKEA (furniture company) where there are no words, just pictures. I would not recommend this product."
1,really...zero,"Wow - I have read lots of bad romances, but this really was bad. Right on to the reviewer to pointed out that Nic's incredible coldness was too played up. There was no logical reason for Rowland to fall in love. Her fall in love with him, yes, possible, but not he with her. She was too emotionally and physically unavailable for any man to find attractive. Also, it is impossible to imagine, in that time, that Rowland would actually not have slept with Nic in the marriage bed. So as far as the law was concerned, they were not legally married and if he had died in the battle when he first left, where would that have left everything? He was ordered to marry and in a way, he disobeyed the King. There was no love, no tenderness in this story. Nic inspires no real sympathy in this reader."
2,"Great set-up, but no delivery","I read the first few pages of ""The Willing Wife"" in the bookstore and thought, ""Oh, what an interesting, sexy set up."" Call me crazy, but a woman who has been forced to marry man after man and has endured sex with them and then is faced with a great warrior who is sensitive and--of course--a great lover appealed to me! When I got the book home, I kept waiting for it to take off, but it never did. My general rule of thumb is that if a romance does not really interest me after 50 or so pages, read the end and see if it is worth it. Even the end did not seem very good. I may be doing Ms Dain an injustice here, but I couldn't really get going on this book. Maybe it will appeal to you, but I doubt it."
1,"The plot sounded promising, but the story did not deliver","When I read what this story was about, I thought wow this will be an interesting read. The author had created an unique and refreshing premise--too bad she failed to deliver an unique and refreshing story. The novel was slow and boring. I did however, think that the heroine was interesting and likable and deserved a much better hero. Furthermore, I felt uncomfortable and appalled with the hero's method of getting through the heroine's barriers and earning her trust. Forcing someone to have sex is not the best way to gain their trust. Please note that despite what one reviewer stated, the heroine was never a widow, even though she had been married four times."
1,hated it.,"... This book was just awful. The plot has already been summed up. Having to wade through over 250 pages for some action was boring. I fail to understand Nicolaa. ... Nicolaa was just plain ridiculous in refusing to believe that men could not love..... Sure, as a reader, you might get some glimpse of why she was so cold, but how could he? He more than tried to please her, yet she was unaffected. Her coldness, her reckless disregard for the women in her ""court"" and not making marriages for them, made her unlikeable. ...Nicolla's not so very logical views were to distorted to be realistic. Poor Rowland. Daine portrayed Nicolaa to severe in her inability to imagine that love was a possibility. Her very coldness was a turn-off for this reader."
3,Lightweight practical headphones,These headphones are lightweight and comfortable for casual use. They don't deliver much in the way of bass but they sound okay given their price.
2,PROBLEMS PROBLEMS PROBLEMS,"The camera itself is actual a decent camera. It is easy to use and very compact, but those are the only two positive aspects. I had so many issues with my camera. I had to return it twice to HP because of defects. The batteries needed to be replaced every week it seemed like and it was a very slow working camera on top of that. A lot of photos would come out blurry because the object (people, animals, etc) would have moved by the time the photo was taken. I lost many great photos due to the defectiveness of the camera. Needless to say I am not happy with HP products."
2,HORRIBLE BATTERY USE,GOOD CAMERA TAKES PICS AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER 1.3 BUT IT HAS ONE SHORTCOMMING... BATTERIES DO NOT LAST AT ALL. EVEN IF YOU DO NOT USE THE COLOR LCD DISPLAY. YOU HAVE TO BRING A BOX OF BATTERIES IF YOU INTEND TO SHOOT MANY PICS
3,"okay camera, wastes batteries","i got this camera about a year ago and it has been ok. the batteries ran out consistently but besides that, it is great"
2,i want to exchange the camera,I am not satisfied with this digital camera at all please i want to return it back and get another one who shall i contact
3,"For niche-babies, nostalgic","This book is about Hackensack, NJ teenagers during and post depression era. I like it because it is written in the time and place of my grandfathers' youth, which I appreciate."
1,"Good Price, but does it work?","The price was good, and I have always thought that Kidde was a respected supplier of smoke detectors. I placed two of the i9030 alarms--one was 3 feet from my fireplace and the other one was beside my original smoke detector (35 years old; came with my house). I then started a smoky fire with the damper closed. Within 30 seconds my original smoke detector went off. The house was very smoky and the odor was acrid. Neither one of the i9030 alarms activated, even after 10 minutes. So I opened the damper, cleared the smoke, and wondered what good is a smoke detector that doesn't detect smoke? Very, very poor product at a very low price. I got what I paid for."
1,Garbage,"It doesn't work... The ""Launcher"" sends the cars off of the track or directly into the wall every time. It's fine if you want to manually push the cars around the track but that's it. There's no way to reconfigure so the cars have any running room. It's junk, simply put."
2,Misled,"I was very disappointed when I received the cd and found that it did not have the version with Mystikal. I have never heard the version on this cd, all I had ever heard in the club and on the radio is the version with Mystikal, which I am guessing was a remix. If you are looking for that version... make sure you are clear with the vendor. Wasted my money on this one. I don't like it at all. Sounds like a couple of kids in the bathroom playing with a tape recorder."
5,Did we read the same book?,"I read this to my son all the time. As a father trying to raise a young boy with positive Black and female images, I love this book. I think the other reviewer misses the color usage totally, the invocation of the serenity and strength of dark colors. It is against them that the see dark colors as negative, as if lighter (maybe whiter?) colors would cheer it up. The lyrical and jazzy movement of the poem works wonderfully. And the women NEVER come off as Aunt Jemimas. Please, like Nicki Giovanni would ever support an illustrator pushing those images on her work. Buy this wonderful little book. Also, though it says for ages 4-8, I have read it to my son since he was 1 1/2, and he has always loved it."
5,The Genie in the Jar,"I totally agree with the review of ""redtwister"" in June 2000. One of the reviewers in April 2000 is throwing an airball in criticizing the graphic art in this book. This book is wonderful! And what first attracted me to it were in the fact the colors of the art on the cover-- the cover has wonderful shades of brown and other earthy colors. It was only afterwards that I noticed is was a children's book by Nikki Giovanni-- that sealed the deal for me since she's one of my favorite poets (along with Sonia Sanchez, Jane Cortez, Ntozake Shange, etc.) and I was single-minded in knowing that I had to get this book for my 4 year old nephew, a child with a Puerto-Rican mom and an African-American dad. Buy this book for any child you know-- white, black, Puerto Rican, Asian, 1 years old, 5 years old, son, daughter, nephew, a friend's kid-- just buy it and put it in their hands!"
1,Thought Provoking......For Adults That Is,"I found myself contemplating this book several times.....and researching author and illustrator voice and training. If Giovanni intends to be thought provoking than she has achieved her goal, but the format is one that I found depressing and racially sterotypical. The images by Raschka evoke the ""pickninny"" in history.....the wild romping of an African-American child could be drawn straight out of the lewd cartoons presented to us in Jim Crowe illustrations. The only vibrant part of the illustrations are the elements that are not of the central characters being the sky and the dresses. Though Giovanni presents a lyrical concept the work is destroyed by illustrations that present a negative image of the ""black loom."""
4,Nice Table for the price,"The quality of this table was even nicer than I had expected. I wasn't too sure how it would be, but it's very sturdy and solid. My husband and I were able to put the piece together in about two hours and the directions were easy to follow. I think the price of this piece of furniture was fair. It's not a high-end piece, but it's not low-quality either. Nice middle-of-the-road piece of furniture that finished off our living room nicely. My only disappointment is the color; it (dark oak) could clearly be categorized as orange. We were trying to match a piece we already had in our living room. Overall, I would recommend this furniture and definitely Home Decorators Collection. Their shipping was faster than indicated and the item was packed nicely."
1,Stay Away From This Case!!,"I bought this case for my iPod because I thought the leather looked nice. Unfortunately, the rough stitching of the case actually caused some scratches on the screen of the iPod. Didn't exactly protect my player...."
3,stop problem,its a nice set with a nice big enough screen. But does anybody knows how to stop a playing music without restarting ??? it is really annoys me sometimes.
3,Fun because I read it when I was 12,This is a young adults book. Maybe 12 year old approx. Fun to read from a historical perspective and the fact I read it when I was young. But all in all a so-so purchase.
3,Haynes jeep wrangler repair manual 1987-1995,Very disapointed in the format for the electrical diagrams. Much harder to follow than the older formats. Otherwise a good manual
2,Looking for info to help with mods? look elsewhere!,"I have had this book for about two years now for use with my1995 Wrangler. I picked it up from my local auto parts store as theywere discontinuing the series. This book has never had the info I have needed. They deal solely with stock OEM replacement, they do not give a thought to any aftermarket applications. They go into detail overkill on easy jobs, and underdocument moderate jobs which is what I bought the manual for in the first place. To make matters worse, the manual makes up its own names for parts. For instance - sway bars, which every true Jeeper is familiar with, are called ""lateral motion stabilizing arms"" or something silly like that. If you are looking for bone stock work on your jeep, buy away. If you are looking to improve on OEM, including custom & aftermarket, look elsewhere! END"
2,Battery For This Product Is Junk,"Start with the positive: all that garbage you hate about Windows machines is gone. The Mac starts up fast and runs relatively flawlessly while in use - no crashing, etc.But, what's the point of owning a laptop with a dead battery? I've owned this computer for just over 12 months and the battery is dead, kaput, sleeps with the fishes. Tethered to the wall with a power cord, it's now just a glorified desktop computer. This rapid battery failure is not unusual, either; go to the Apple store website and check the reviews for the battery that powers the Macbook. This battery is junk.So, the bottom line appears to be this: budget $130 every year to buy a new battery.Frankly, I'm inclined to slink back to a Windows machine with my next purchase. I shouldn't have to pay $130 every year to ""renew"" my Apple laptop privileges."
4,Get a Core 2 Duo,"Get the newer Core 2 Duo revision from late 2006, even if you can't find as good a deal on it. This model runs too hot for lap use. Also, these 1st generation machines had variable build quality. I've worked with 4 of them and 2 were 100% solid and 2 are super flaky despite repeated fixes by Apple."
5,Great Computer - Apple's Best!,"I have been using a maxed out PowerBook 1400, which finally died. I have an aversion to spending over $1000 on a laptop, but gritted my teeth and ordered a MacBook from Amazon because they had a great price and I trust them.What a computer!!! It continues Apple's great operating system and interface with a super fast Intel processor. I use a Dell PC at work, and I can't wait to get home to my Macintosh. I also like that it's compatible with my older iMac, so I can easily transfer files back and forth. All Macs can upload Microsoft files, and save in Microsoft format, so there is no problem working with others.All in all, I couldn't be more pleased!Bruce"
2,Fun computer but not such a gr8 experience...,"I have been a PC user for over a decade. I got so bored of it and so decided to try the Macbook. All worked great for first two weeks and then I decide to try playing a DVD for the first time. Found a few scratches on the disc... and decided to try another disc and the same result.Finally took it to an Apple store to get a replacement but they instead offered repair service because it was 18 days instead of 14days. The store Rep's were rude and arrogant and very strict about their policies. Ofcourse, the problem existed all along because I found this during the first DVD use. They promised 5 days service... but its already 4 days and the website says ""On Hold"" because parts are on order. I find the same rudeness with the reps on the phone.I like the Mac though but just the product quality and customer service has prompted me to downgrade the rating."
2,"Unfortunately quality and durability of 13"" MacBook is very bad","Unfortunately quality and durability of Mac Book is very bad, as well us Apple warranty service. This Notebook is not going to last more than few months with heavy usage.My died after just few months, due to some logic board failure, which Apple refused to fix. For the past 4 years I was using Dell latitude 600 and it is still running, despite heavy usage. During 4-5 years period I repaired my Latitude only once(DELL technician came to home and fix it). DELL never decline any service due to ""User error/fault"" !!!Stay away from Apple Mac Book.If you want to run Mac OS, then just buy any Notebook with any Intel Core Dual Processor and install Mac OS on it."
4,runing too slow for me,"i already hv it for 1 month and 20 days and i have never experienced the randow shut down like you guys were talkin about,, it might be they have fixed it or i got the got one... the only problem i hv.. this thing is runnin too damn slow for me,, might be i just need macbook pro... afterall this is a good thing if u don't multi task it too much like i do.."
1,Not impressed....,"I was very excited to switch from a PC to a Mac & after a lot of convincing, my husband agreed to try it. Well, it showed up and didn't even turn on! We got it to boot a couple of times, but it wouldn't stay on long enough to get through the welcome screens. We sent it back and ordered one directly from Apple. That one works great. Something must have happened either in Amazon's warehouse or during shipping."
2,macbook random shutdown syndrome,"I bought this computer 5 months ago , but now I am experiencing random shutdown . I hope Apple will make a recall on this product ."
1,"shuts down randomly, you lose it for two weeks","Don't buy this. After you've had it for a month or two (ie after the 15-day return window) it will start shutting itself off randomly more and more often until it becomes useless. If you call Apple, trying to get them to admit there's a problem is like pulling teeth, and even if you succeed, the solution is for you to mail them your laptop and do without it for two weeks. Because of their defect. Wonderful."
2,fan of Gilberto Gil,"I wasn't that acquainted with Nacao Zumbi except for a song or two off the Brasil 2Mil Cd. But if you like nice vocals and harmonies, chord progressions, you might be disappointed with this, as I was. Almost every song has lyrics shouted more than sung, in a rap/hip-hop-like style, but with almost no melody or background chords...lots of percussion, but it didn't have that intoxicating brazilian sound, or even the creative transformation of that sound like on Brasil 2Mil. I'm sure there are tons of other fans of brazilian music who would say i'm a traditionalist, so i don't mean to offend anyone, but just want to warn prospective buyers that if you are thinking typical or even modern brazilian music, don't buy this cd!"
2,Soundtrack Distorted,"I have only tried playing this movie on my sony blu ray player, and the sound was distorted, making it unwatchable. The disc itself doesn't appear to be damaged. So it tells me it may be the distributor itself. I will try playing it on my computer and my non blu ray player to see if it can be viewed through those units...otherwise it's a total loss I guess. Oh well I can't really complain for a $1.50 movie but it will make me leery on ever using this seller again."
1,"Uh, Really not good","No Offense, but just because a movie is gay themed does not make it good or worthwhile anymore. The acting is atrocious - really and it looks really cheap. A couple of good nude/sex scenes, but really an exploitative piece of crap. This makes Cruising look tame and masterful."
2,As disappointing as it is brief,"Seeing that most of the reviews here are disappointing ones, I'm forced to agree. I expected more references to the heyday of classic television. While Carl must have a thousand stories about that era, he has evidently saved them for a different book. As for THESE anecdotes, I don't think I cracked a smile once. But I sure cracked a yawn."
2,"I love Carl Reiner, but . . .","Saw a lot of Reiner on TV growing up in the 60s, and he was always entertaining and funny. Not so this book. At best, its a behind-the-scenes look at a creative genius' more mundane moments. At worst, its a mish-mash of random thoughts and name-dropping. If you imagine Reiner telling the stories out loud, you might get a kick out of some of them, but on the printed page, its boring and doesn't tell you anything you haven't heard about show business from a hundrred other sources. Carl is only 81 - better luck next time!"
1,Great Mind - Horrible Book,I have long admired the talents of Carl Reiner and looked forward to reviewing this book. I give book reviews at many different venues - primarily for people in independent living complexes and try to select people they can relate to. I am almost through this book and have about ten minutes of material! What was he thinking? It is so convoluted - confusing - senseless - I just am amazed it was even published! He doesn't develop any topic enough to get to really know him. I am really sorry I wasted my money and time on this book. When I read the other reviews - I was amazed at how different they felt.
1,Didn't get what I bought either,"I had the same problem. Ordered a spool of Cat6, received a spool of Cat5e. Once is a mistake, twice is a disturbing trend. I see the cable is now resold through Tiger Direct, rather than Computer Brain. Maybe that's an improvement, maybe not. My opinion: $115 is too cheap for Cat6. Spend the extra bucks somewhere else if you really want/need Cat6."
3,Didn't get what I bought,"I purchased CAT6 cabling but received Cat5e. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to contact the company to discuss this as the cable arrived the day before I had to have it installed. So, it could have been a mistake or it could have not been. I'd say review a bit more about this company to make sure that nobody else has had this type of issue. However, the CAT5e that I received works fine"
1,CAT 5e Still A Problem,"I can confirm that it's still a problem receiving CAT 5e instead of CAT 6 - steer clear of this item if you need CAT 6. Poor service from Tiger Direct too, haven't heard back from them in a couple days now as to what to do with my useless CAT 5e."
2,Not Approved for Human Use,This disclaimer is clearly displayed on the back side of the actual product. (NOT APPROVED FOR HUMAN USE) It should have been more prominent prior to making a purchase.
4,DMSO,"Well packed, quick shipping. Because of the cold weather it arrived crystalized. After a few hours it was a liquid again."
3,Its okay,"Im a green side Corpsman (combat medic for the Marines) and its a mediocre manual. The SOAP note sick call portion is definitely on weak side. You can tell its geared for Army medics because, it does not meet the standards of Navy medicine."
3,"Good for training line medics, but little utility for treatment medics","I bought this book prior to Iraq thinking that it would be useful for medic training. I found it was useful for line medic training, but did not have anything significant to contribute, in terms of Tactical Combat Casualty Care, required for treatment medics in a Level 1 or Level 2 facility. If you are a Battalion Surgeon looking for material to bring to Iraq, go ahead and skip this."
3,BirdX,Ok so we bought and tried this in our shop. THe shop size is 250 X 40.WIth a open bay. Here is what I found: the birds that have been nestingwhich I am going to say generational thru years didnt leave. We had touse a differnt method to remove. But what it did seem to do very well sofar is to keep other birds away.
2,BirdX BXP Repeller Noise Concern,"I have lots of Birds roosting on the utility wires around my house. I have use BirdX Repeller for a weekend so far and it works with the low volume setting up to 20-25 feets. The main problem I have is the noise generated by this device. At the low volume (one third of the volume) which is already(2-3X) louder than the existing bird's noise, it has bothered me a bit already and not sure if my neighbor is being ignore or not yet. I don't see myself able to use the extreme high setting as it will sounds like a siren and bother the neigborhood in the entire block. Not sure if it is supposed to used in the residential area. My expectation is that low volume setting will work up the 50 feet."
3,May partially work,"When first installed to project Apple Tree crop it seemed to work to keep birds at bay. After about a month the birds seemed to adjust to its presence. When the Bird Repeller was removed, after the apples were harvested, there was a definite immediate increase in the number of birds in the area. So it seemed to partially work."
2,Did not work on sparrows.,"Over a month now and has not bothered the sparrows in my horse arena. Called manufacturer and tried several settings suggested, but did not work."
2,waste of money,it chased the sparrows away for two days and then they came back and just got used to it. A waste of money
5,I can't believe it but it works!,I rarely write a review but immediately after I put this loud obnoxious thing on my driveway all the birds left and we've had no bird droppings on our cars ever since. I hid it in the bushes and I guess the neighborhood things that every few minutes a range of different types of wild birds fly around my house because of the noise. I think it's hysterical - I smile every time I hear this thing go off.
3,A Wacky trip through 60's New Orleans with a mad doctor.,"As far as classic films go, this is not one...but it is fun. While Dr. Morgus is on the screen, the film is funny and clever and moves very well. Unfortunatly, when the good doctor is not seen, the story tends to drag. Also it is nice to see New Orleans as it was in the early 60's. Check this out if you are fan of New Orleans or mad scientists. END"
1,If you value sound quality at all -- AVOID!!,"The quality of sound that you get with this and other similar products is, at best, very poor. I think that mono 8-track players had better sound quality than the iPod with these FM tranmitters. Which is strange, because some in-car CD changers use the same wireless FM concept, and the quality is a lot better. Also, as many people have mentioned, if you live anywhere near an urban area, you will have a very difficult time finding an open radio station. Don't waste your money."
1,Be care with this cable,I just bought an ipod video 30G and everything was working pretty well until one week after this cable just turned hot and burn my ipod memory and never worked again. I?m still waiting for the replacement thks to the mac warranty but the truth is that i don?t recommend it anymore
2,Not so great,"Always sounds fuzzy, very bad recpetion in some areas. The griffin road trip is much better. The good feature about it though is that it charges and is easily moved around your car."
3,FM Transmitters: Works but has Limitations,"I have been using my Monster Cable iCarPlay Plus for a little over a month. Monster has manfactured a good product but there are limitations to FM transmission. Under the best of conditions FM transmission represents a compromise of audio fidelity. Some days iCarPlay works very well, on others there's just too much static. iCarPlay is a good compromise if you cannot hard wire your connection or frequently change vehicles. Bundled with a built-in charger, the iCarPlay Plus is the best FM transmitter available today."
4,Good Product But....,"This is a good product but it seems to have a little less than perfect sound quality. When plugged in to the ipod and the car, the volume on your radio must be turned up all the way for you to hear anything. I would also want more radio channels to choose from, since it is difficult to find a clear station for the transmitter to co0nnect with. Other that those two problems it suits most of my needs."
3,"Good Out on The Open Road, Not In The City","Wasn't able to get a clear station in Los Angeles. It was pretty much unusable. When I headed up to the Sierras on Hwy 395, it worked great.For the city, I found the Newer Technology RoadTrip FM to be much better and I got for $14.99. It doesn't charge but since I only use it for trips within Los Angeles, that is fine. I save the Monster iCarPlay Plus for the long road trips on the open highway.Note: I tried another charger/fm transmitter combo and it didn't work too well either in the city..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR iPOD TO LIVE,"I bought this product 7 months ago, and thought it was the greatest product in the world. Except with minor static, it worked wonderfully in the city and on the road. Then a month ago it completely fried the hard drive in my iPod. Since my iPod was less than 12 months old, Apple replaced it for $ 32 shipping and handling. I got my replacement 2 weeks ago and after two uses with the Monster cable, the replacement is now fried.This is a major issue with the product.USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION, or better yet, save your ipod and find a different solution."
3,Srong signal but strange high-pitched whine,"We live in Chicago and found that this transmitter can broadcast clearly over a few areas of the dial (assuming we put down our antenna). However, a few weeks after purchasing the iCarPlay Plus, it developed a high-pitched whine that became more pronounced over the next month. We contacted Monster and got the unit replaced (for free--great customer service). Unfortunately, the new unit developed the same whine. I'm not sure if it is an issue with our car (a Honda CRV) since I haven't seen a comparable complaint in the reviews."
3,Watch out for defects,"I am waiting for my 2nd replacement to arrive - the first one didn't recognize my nano and the transmitter didn't work on the second one. Third times the charm I hope - I've heard when it works it works well. Note for nano users: if you have trouble, try resetting your nano by holding down the center key and menu. If that doesn't work, make sure you have updated the software on your iPod. If that doesn't work, Amazon has a great return policy."
2,Disappointing,"The iCarPlay does a great job of charging the iPod and I love being able to put it anywhere so I can easily reach it. I looked at docking models, but they wouldn't work with the way my car dash is set up.Unfortunately, I can't use this product because even in my fairly small urban area I am unable to find a single unused radio frequency! Obviously there are frequencies not officially used, but the ""bleed"" from nearby frequencies makes them unusable with this product. The only unused frequency I could find was 87.7 which won't work with the iCarPlay.Before buying, check your radio!"
5,Excellent product that works really well,"I just bought one of these monster ipod car adapters after hearing and reading good things about them. This fm transmitter really is a great product. The sound clarity is really good, the only exception being if you turn the radio really high, but even then it's not too bad. It just sounds like a song coming over a regular radio.I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good reliable fm transmitter for their ipod. I live near NYC and the reception is still great despite all the channels out there."
2,Very far from crisp sound,"I bought this item because of the not-so-bad reviews on this site. Many users give it a 4-5 stars.I am actually very disappointed. The hiss in the background is very noticeable.I guess this item works at an acceptable (not good) level with loud music. It is terrible with Podcasts as the dialogues do not cover the background noise.I do not have any other experience with other transmitters, therefore I don't know if my complaints are specific to this items or to FM transmitters in general."
3,"Probably one of the better ones, but still only satisfactory","Based on other reviews, this is probably one of the better transmitters. It is however only satisfactory. As the unit is moved or shifted you get some interference. As I drive about 30 minutes into Miami I always get a little bit of radio station noise/interference on any station I choose. If you live in a small city this may be less of a problem. If you have a cassette player, then the cassette adapter is a much better choice. My friend's car has the antenna in the back of the car, and this small distance causes even more noise problems. I don't think any of these ""in car"" transmitters are great. This one is probably one of the best choices available."
2,Hopefully but has not worked yet,"I was really hopeful after reading the glowing reviews, but also tentative given the negatives. I also noted the problems with the Nano. The product is easy to set up and to use, but I could not get it to work with my Nano. I am not sure if it is a Nano problem or a congestion problem, but I was able to get several light static to fully free stations programmed. I also tried the Nano reset while plugged into the iCar (and just in case, with out being plugged). Neither worked for me. I am going to try again and then pass it on to a regular iPod user and go with the Kensington as another reader suggested. This gets +2 stars for ease of use and -3 since it does not work with the iPod Nano (yet! - but still hopeful)."
5,Monster Cable iCarPlay Plus Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod,"Great product, easy to use and very good reception."
2,Problems with reception,"This product did not work well in the South Florida area (lots of competing radio stations). Even on open frequencies, I could still hear background static through the transmitter. The problem was apparently made worse because I have a Honda with the antenna in the back window. If I held the transmitter up in the air, the reception got a little better, probably because it had a clearer path to the antenna, but obviously you can't drive like that. I'm returning the product and trying a different one."
4,Does the job,"I used this product as long as my car did not have a sound system that would allow me to connect my iPod. It worked great, although the sound wasn't always up to par. I found out that lowering the output on the iPod to the halfway point and turning it up on the car radio usually helped make it a bit better."
1,Not worth it!,"When I first got this, it was wonderful and worked great! I had this product in my car for about 3-5 months and it broke, with no hope or way to fix it. It would have been a better purchase elsewhere, more reliable place. Not worth the money! I'm not hard on my use of things, but this wore down fast and hard."
3,Good transmitter but not a charger.,"This is a very good transmitter, but it's not a charger... This is a huge desadvantage, because when the device is playing music it looses a lot of charge... I won't buy this product again."
2,So Glad I Didn't Pay Retail Price!,"I bought this thing for about 20 bucks, and probably would've killed myself if I had paid the 60 or 70 dollars that it usually retails for. You're gonna think this thing's great if you live somewhere that's got 3 radio stations, but for the rest of us who live in a society, you won't get a clear signal. It's just like listening to the car radio back in the day, when your friend in the passenger seat had to determinedly work the knobs for you. This retro aspect appeals to me and warms my heart, but it's 2010! I expect and demand clarity!"
2,An increadible waste of money,"I hate this thing. It is complete junk and does NOT work well at all. If you live anywhere with more than three or four radio stations, you will experience inteference using this. Save yourself the trouble and get something that wires directly into your radio via cable or cassette adapter.The fatal flaw is that you are using this in a car and moving through different transmission areas. There is no way you can stay on one station - any station - and not eventually have a problem.The only reason I gave this two stars is that it charges your ipod."
3,"If possible, use a cassette adaptor instead","This was possibly the best radio broadcaster that I've used for my iPod. That said, the utility of these was rather lacking as I live in the city and drive through traffic constantly. If I wasn't having enough problems finding open stations, driving past other vehicles inhibits the broadcast quality.In the end, I realized that my car's cassette player was a wonderful option to have installed. Any lossage possible over that connection is nowhere near as bad as the unpredictable FM spectrum. Until my next car comes with a direct input jack, this is just a car charger for me."
4,No empty station necessary,"I had to buy a new fm transmitter because I purchased a 5th Generation ipod and the itrip I used for my 4th Generation would no longer work.Now, given I don't live in a densely populated area... but there was something more than static on each of the 3 stations you can select from. I chose the station that seemed to have the weakest signal, and the transmitter works just fine. I think it works better than the previous itrip. I commute 20 miles to work and haven't had any trouble with interference.The only small con that I see is that the connection to the bottom of the ipod decreases the places that I can set it in the car. I used to prop the 4th generation ipod with the itrip on top between the gear shift and the dash. This product causes me to have to use a cup holder or lay it flat on the console."
1,Received the wrong transmitter,"Be aware when you order this product that you might get a diferent and less quality one.People is not getting confused with the previows transmitter, they like me are getting the WRONG product. I order this product two weeks ago and i got a transmitter diferent that the one on the picture, it is the same brand but like they are saying you are limited to only 8 stations wich can only be selected by a single button, i wouldn't have problem to have just 8 station to select from if at least one of them could give me a clear signal, but after several tests on a couple of cars I got very disapointed by the high level of noise this unit adds to my music. I'm returning mine tomorrow.This is the transmitter i got:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00019068G/ref=pd_cp_e_title/103-5708021-3636604?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glance&n;=172282P.S: this is not a review of the product on this page but the one I got when I order it."
2,Ok if you don't have another option.,After about a month of I went back to my casette adapter. Getting a station without static is tough and mine frequently reset itself back to the factory presets. Even when there wasn't static the audio quality wasn't that great.
3,Great concept - OK sound quality,"This is a great design combining a charger and FM Transmitter. It is easy to use and offers more options than other similar products (you can trasmit on any FM frequency and set your own 3 presets).The problem is the sound quality isn't great. Less than CD, less than radio, I'd say less than tape quality. The other problem is in the Baltimore area I can't find a frequency that doesn't already have something broadcasting on it. I get interference on every channel. If I could do it again I think I would have tried the Kensington 33185 Digital FM Transmitter/Car Charger for iPod, iPod Mini, or iPod Nano. It has much better reviews."
4,Great way to maximize use of your iPod!,"I bought this transmitter after driving cross-country with my brother. We used the same product in his car, and we were able to easily find and switch stations from Illinois to South Carolina with great reception. I had previously bought a cheaper product and found that it really did not work well.One tip for urban areas - use the high end of the stations (107.5, 106.7). These seem to work the best no matter where I go. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with an iPod."
1,THIS PRODUCT STINKS!,"THIS IS THE SECOND iCARPLAY PLUS WIRELESS TRANSMITTER/CHARGER FOR MY iPOD WITHIN 4 MONTHS. THE FIRST ONE JUST STOPPED WORKING (I TOOK EXREMELY GOOD CARE OF IT!). THIS CURRENT TRANSMITTER/CHARGER HAS PRE-PROGRAMMED STATIONS ON IT. THIS STINKS BECAUSE I CANNOT CHANGE THE PRE-SETS TO STATIONS THAT HAVE BETTER RECEPTION. I HEAR JUST AS MUCH STATIC (IF NOT MORE) AS I DO THE MUSIC. SINCE I LOVE HEARING CRYSTAL CLEAR MUSIC, I OPTED TO JUST CHANGE MY STEREOS IN BOTH MY CARS WITH IPOD READY RECIEVERS. LOOKING BACK, I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN. MY CORDLESS iTRIP TRANSMITTER WORKS MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
2,Keep looking,"It does transmit, but a very weak signal. I have to put the iPod in the back seat to get it to work at all. To match a normal radio/CD volume you have to turn your radio all the way up. The transmitter is weak and I loose signal next to ANY power lines and I'm constantly switching between the three programmed stations to get a cleaner sound. Also if you move it while plugged in there's high levels of static. If I could have tried it first, I would have kept looking. I think there's a reason it costs less."
3,Monster Cable iCarPlay,"I am a big fan of monster cable products however, this particular product does not give a clean connection and is very sensitive to position or motion. It is adequate but not up to the usual high standards I expect from Monster"
2,Not happy,"I thought that this transmitter was a great product until I used it. There is a lot of interference, when the songs have pauses sound a lot of noise. Now, I am using the cassete and the trasmitter became into a charger for a car."
3,Not impressed,"For the price I paid for this thing I expected it to last longer than it did.For one thing, the sound quality sucks. I ended up staying with the cassette player adapter instead of listening to my iPod though this.It was good for keeping it charged while listening though... until the cord wore out and at that point it was completely useless.Would I buy this again? Not a chance."
2,Static and more static.,"My iTrip broke in a car accident. I originally ordered a replacement iTrip, but then cancelled it and got this because the reviews were better. Well, I tried several perfectly clear stations, but the best I could get was still like 10% static. Completely unlistenable. It seemed like if I held it up in the middle of the car, it would get decent, but as soon as I let go it was back to static. The iTrip worked way better for me so I'm going back to that.I gave it two stars because I have a friend who has the previous version and he loves it; I've heard his and the quality is perfect. It seems like these transmitters just work randomly for some people and not for others... you have to try them all to find the one that works for you."
4,Great Investment,"I bought my ipod nano soley for the purpose of not having to lug around my CDs into my car, office, and then backhome. This Monster FM Transmitter is great. I get some static, but only if when I'm handling the device or if I'm changing radio zones. I've mounted the digital readout to my consule with smalle pieces of velcro and have purchased sticky pad for the iPod so that it stays in one place (I of course have a protective case around the iPod so that no glue gets on the actual iPod). Just great...I love it."
5,Nice Upgrade!,"This is a sweet upgrade from the previous monster transmitter, which was terribly hard to read, but still the best transmitter on the market! The digital face on this one is awesome.I have an iTrip and it sucks in comparison."
5,Great product Monster Cable iCarPaly Wireless FM,"This is amazing product, it Works perfect, great sound and without interference, you can select the frequency to listen"
2,not impressive at all!,"my expections were alot higher from this wireless charger. but first of all this thing has so many cables that dont fit on the dashboard, and second the transmiting quality is very weak. it felt like i am listening my ipod from a AM radio station. dont recommeded! i went on buying another FM transmitter called SiLINK for $20 from target. this is alot better and small enough to carry in my car."
1,Not Impressed at all,"I bought a Monster FM Transmitter after reading the Amazon reviews which are pretty evenly divided pro vs con. I didn't expect the sound quality to be as good as playing a CD, but I did expect it to be as good as radio reception. It was a no-brainer setting it up, and it worked, but I was completely disappointed in the sound quality. I tried several stations on the radio, and it was like I was listening to a poorly tuned station. The background static on the best channel was distracting and the sound quality so poor that I immediately returned it.If you are concerned with sound quality, this is not a viable way of getting iPod music through your car stereo."
2,Save your money,"I bought the monster cable directly from an Apple store. After only using it a few times, I now only get sound from speakers on the passenger side of my car. I have to wave my iPod around with the cable attached to find the right spot that will play music on all the speakers...not a safe move when you're driving. I paid $80 for this and am extremely disappointed in the performance. Another peeve is that the cable is difficult to detach from the iPod. I have to squeeze the latches really hard before it dislodges from the unit. The only thing the cable is good for is charging up the iPod."
2,Not worth it,"I don't write a ton of reviews but thought I had to share my thoughts about this product. I really feel this is a lousy device. The sound quality is not anywhere near FM quality, let alone CD (which I knew it would not be). There is a ton of static that is very noticable in the background. I don't like changing the EQ (which really needs to be done to use this product) each time I use it.So - better off using a direct input like the tape interface or better yet look at products from dension and such.Good luck!"
1,Zapped my ipod,"I was excited to try this product as several reviewers sad it generated an even clearer signal than the Griffin Roadtrip I was using.As soon as I plugged my iPod Nano into the Monster Transmitter the screen on my iPod went blank, never to return again. So, now I've got a broken nano.I bought a new Nano and have resumed using my Griffen Roadtrip with no problems. I would highly recommend it over the Monster unit that destryoyed my iPod."
2,Crackling sound,"The Monster Cable transmitter ""crackles"" very loudly (through the car speakers) any time it is touched or moved while transmitting music. It is very annoying."
2,Static city!,"I bought this because I liked the idea of transmitter and charger all in one, and I have been pleased with Monster Cable products in the past. Unfortunately, this just doesn't work.I live in Detroit, but also drive to Cleveland, and go through lots of very rural areas in between and around Michigan and Ohio. I have yet to find a channel that remains static-free for any length of time, no matter where I am. I don't know how the few other reviewers that didn't have problems managed it, but my experience is like the majority of reviewers here who mostly have static. I guess I will try the casette adapter, or pay the bigger bucks to get a hard-wired connection put in, but I can't take the static!"
1,Doesn't Work For Me,I live in the Washington Metropolitan area and I had high hopes after reading the reviews of this product. I even preset all possible channels on my car stereo. The only one that works at all is the very first channel and even that one almost always has a lot of static. This is strange to me because it even works better on this setting when you can hear the original channel is coming in pretty clear and another channel is not. Sometimes if I move my ipod around I get a bit of a better reception but when your driving this is not very practical. If I had not already thrown away the package I would definitely return it.
2,"Good charger, but...","Works fine as a charger, but I cannot get decent reception on any of the channels in the LA/Orange County area: too much interference"
4,Works great,Nice styling and easy setup. Works great. I especially like the fact that it charges the ipod while in use.
4,Works with the Nano,My friend owns this and uses it with his iPod and is quite happy with it. I recently bought a Nano and yes this does work with the Nano.The ability to tune almost any frequency is very handy. VERY HANDY.I have found more consistent reception at the higher end of the band (I use mine at 107.9) than the lower.The only thing I do not like about it is that I require about 20% more volume than when listening to a radio station.
4,IP FM Transmitter,A friend of mine had one of these and we used it on a road trip. It worked great once we were out of the city. If all you do is city driving you may find it difficult to find a clear frequency.
2,Just like the others...,"I thought I would wait some months to give this product a fair shake.I have found the same as others, that it is very hard to find an open station - I also have the DLO dock, which works slightly better, but I was looking for a less obvious choice. The cord is obnoxiously long, so long that someone in your backseat could be working the iPod. Also, my car has the built in antenna, and it seems to have more static on the line. If given the choice, I would definitely NOT buy this product agan."
4,iPod car adapter,Works well enough. Top of line stereo on my truck so I can easily tell the difference in sound from a cd or xm to the ipod. But in most cases it stays clear and has no interference. I found that if I hang the cord over the rear view mirror (not sure if legal) it comes in excellent. Not many other options to place it.Beats having it with limited channels. Took it to Idaho and it was nice to have plenty of tunes between two ipods. Good buy.
2,FM transmitter for iPod,Poor performance in most populated area. Works better removing the car antenna but the result is still below a real FM station. The 3 preset channels are very helpful and have been enough when moving around.
1,Maybe in mid-Kansas???,"Bought one of these to go with my new 20G clickwheel iPod. Thought . . . great, I can listen in my car and stop dragging 20-30 CDs around! But . . . there are only 8 preset stations on this iCarPlay and I live in a pretty urban area where the FM dial is pretty crowded. As a consequence, even under the best of circumstances I got LOTS of static and interference making this thing SO unlistenable I had to return it. Paid about $20 more for a dlo unit that you can set anywhere on the FM spectrum and I am MUCH happier."
1,Monster Wireless Transmitter does not charge 4G iPod,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006BKH3S/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleMonster Wireless Transmitter does not charge 4G iPod, it will transmit but when you plug it into the Nano 4G I get a message , unsupported device, charger will not work."
4,Great little gadget,"This device is awesome. My wife uses it daily to play her ipod music in the car on the drive to work. It charges the ipod and has 3 buttons that can be set to any FM radio station you choose.A few observations:The buttons for the 3 station buttons are very easy to bump, we have on occassion bumped it simply by setting the ipod down. So if the radio stops playing, check the stations. You most likely changed the station uninentionally.The second observation which is also minor is the power level of the radio adapter. This might be a size restriction, but we have noticed on occassion someone driving by will overpower our transmitter. This can easily be fixed by changing channels but I thought it interesting. I also tested the transmitter vs my satellite radio and the satellite radio won hands down.All in all this device is good for what it's used for. It plays the ipod songs on your car radio well. If that's what your looking for, no hesitation here."
4,Easy to use and convenient,"This transmitter is easy to use. Great to have while on the road and I want to listen to my Ipod. I like that it will charge my Ipod while listening to music. Occassionally, I hear static along with my music, but infrequently."
2,does not work in Chicago Burbs,This will not work well at all in Chicago or the surrounding area. Other FM signals will dominate the weak signal trasmitted by this device.It did work well once I got 30-40 miles outside of the city.
4,"If you have to use an FM transmitter, this should be the one.","Positive: Transmit on any FM station. AND charge your iPod. Switch between your three pre-set stations safely while driving.Negative: It's still an FM transmitter, so the sound quality will never be CD quality you would get with a direct connection. The buttons may be a little too sensitive, sometimes the station will get changed if it falls against the shifter or between the seats. No big deal, I just pick it up and change it back.Overall: Good choice."
2,It really ...charges !,"Well, after i read all the reviews i decided to give the monster icarplay a chance...but to be honest, i'm not really happy with it and i ended up using a cassette adapter from Jenson.Now i'm using both...the cassette for the music and the transmitter as a charger."
4,Works great under diverse conditions,"I have used this product in the San Francisco Bay Area and Toronto, Canada. In both cases it worked great! Considering the fact that both of these metropolitan areas are heavily populated and thus host countless radio stations I was happy to find that the transmitter is so effective.Once in a while you will hear a little bit of static but switching to one of the other presets quickly does the trick. The only significant drawback is major interference when my cellphone rings.The value of my IPOD has skyrocketed with this product and I would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Clear signal, but low volume","I've used the iCarPlay for about a month now, and have had no problems with finding clear channels to tune it to here in west Michigan. There is no static, and the signal is nice and clear.I use it with the Belkin TuneDok iPod Cup Holder, and it makes for a nice little in-car setup.What I don't like is the fact that the resulting volume level is just too low for really enjoying the music in my opinion.PROS:+ Easy to setup.+ Charges iPod while listening.+ Clear signal.CONS:- Cables are long and can make a mess of the dash area if you don't have somewhere to tuck the extra away.- Volume levels are really not high enough.- Tuner starts at 88.1 where as there are a few open frequencies starting at 87.5 on my radio, but now I'm just being picky."
3,Ken,"Overall, product functions as designed but not great. Nice feature is being able to program to available frequencies in your area and not just the pre-programmed frequencies. Unfortunately, it's impossible to completely eliminate some level of static. If you car stereo has a built in equalizer, you can minimize some of it but it's always there. I purchased this after trying the cassette adapter. My car stereo cassette player has an auto-reverse feature. After inserting the cassette adapter, the stereo kept reversing itself and finally ejected the adapter. I had no other alternative but to purchase an FM transmitter."
3,Poor reception,"I'll give it three stars for the benefit of the doubt -- maybe it was just my car. However, I could barely get any reception... after trying various stations I could get only the faintest signal, even after trying to move the device around the car to try to get better reception."
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"I'm not one to usually be sucked into spontaneous buying of products, but this little gizmo caught my eye. Since Monster has had a reputation of creating really great products in the past I reasoned this one must be great too. Unfortunately it wasn't. It transmits a weak (IMHO too weak) FM signal that you tune into on your car radio to play through your car stereo at the same time charging your iPod. The problem is that every station you attempt to pair the unit with is full of static and noise, and just moving the cord slightly will squelch static horribly. At first I thought it might be a problem with the antenna in my 2003 Ford Expedition so I tried to use it in my 2002 Nissan Altima. The static problems were the same in both cars. It is my recommendation that you spend $80.00 elsewhere."
4,Far better than I expected,"I bought this to use in the wife's mini-van, I liked the idea of being able to choose any station and having a built-in charger.Overall I'm very happy with this, I tried the three pre-set stations and have had very good performance on 98.1, so I haven't neeeded to try anything else. I'm living outside of Washington D.C. where the airwaves are crowded, but I haven't had any static so far.Sound quality is very good, it's not CD level or as good as the Sony tape deck I use in my car, but it is much better than I expected. I highly recommend this product."
1,At least my truck didn't catch fire...,"I made very careful consideration before I purchased this item. I took into account the Monster brand name and I also had read several good reviews on it. It was very easy to configure and use. It worked fine for about a month until it trouble came my way. One morning I tried to change the station because of so much static. I pushed the buttons and nothing worked. I grumbled and drove off to work. When I arrived at workplace 15 minutes later I started to smell something. I picked up the transmitter which was now red hot and showing signs of the plastic melting, so I immediately unplugged it. I'm glad I didn't leave it in, or my truck might have caught fire. I've gone back to using a cassette adapter. Sigh..."
1,Disappointing!!!,I thought buying the more expensive version of the Monster cable would be a great solution to playing and charging the Ipod in the car. Nothing but STATIC - terrible even on the less busy stations. Hissing noises only. Waste of money.
2,I was very disappointed.,"I was very disappointed with this product's performance in real life conditions. The product performed well as far as delivering a signal that my antennae could pick up and play in the desired radio station. However, I was not able to find a static/noise free station in my area.My recommendation before purchasing this product is to figure out whether you can tune in to a static/noise free station in your area. Keep in mind that whatever noise or static you pick up will be superimposed on the signal coming from the this Monster Cable when you play your iPOD."
3,Am I missing something?,"I had the DLO transpod but got rid of it as I was not happy with it. It seems what one transmitter offers, another lacks...for example..everytime you turn off the car, the channel on the transmitter resets. I have tried repeatedly to save the desired channel to button #1, but for some reason, it just doesn't work. I have read and re-read the directions...I don't see that I'm missing something!?! Very frustrating.As for using with a Nano...that's what I have and I've had NO problems with it working with the Nano. Now if I could only get the channels to program!! Ugh!!I am gonna try what another reviewer said though -about it providing the quietest channel when it starts up...maybe that will work..."
3,Worked Great Till it Didn't,"I purchased an iCar after reading the glowing reviews and it was everything promised for the first month or so. Then it started to work only intermittently and now it doesn't work at all.Of Course I've thrown away the packaging so I can't return it to the seller.Seriously, when it worked it worked great. A little static but that's to be expected.Well now I have to find the sales invoice and return it for service. What a pain.Gary"
3,"It's as good as it can be, but","It's well made, compact, sleek, but it cannot always drown out the background noise created by the FM carrier wave, and treble is definitely soft--and the suggested solution of turning up the tone controls on the radio works only until your teeth begin to grate. Sooner or later your selected ""quiet"" frequency will start overwhelming Jimi Hendrix as a rogue station intrudes--which is why they thoughtfully allow you three choices. But dealing with that when trying to concurrently shift between fifth-sixth on a gravel-covered roundabout remains a challenge. They have not quite created a ""Monster"", but it will do in a pinch (at a minimum it's better than having to shake a new CD loose from its sleeve and deal with the one you just ejected), or until you buy a car with dedicated access to your iPod."
3,"recommendable, but not as good as I thought",I am living in the Bay Area in California. This product works fine in some cities. I found out that this product works better with the car that has build in antenna.
1,Kept shorting out,"Worked great in about 10 minute intervals, then would short out and turn back to the radio. It could have just been my car, but I'd heard this product had done the same thing to other people after I'd already bought the iCarPlay. Maybe it will work great if it doesn't short out on you; maybe it won't & you'll be frustrated"
1,Do Not Use with 5G iPod,This product does not work with the video iPod. I used it one time with my new iPod and then the iPod would not turn off unless it was connected to the Monster cable. I had to send my iPod in for replacement.
2,works good at the beginning...but...,"It worked great at the beginning, but after using it for nearly a month, the device will shut itself off for no reason after playing for 5 minutes. The light went off and not even unplug it and plug it back in works. And if I waited long enough to plug it back, it'll work for another 5 minutes and repeats history. I had to return it (lucky that it broke within 30 days.)"
2,too much static,"There's a constant, faint static behind my music when I use this transmitter. I have to turn the radio up pretty loud to be able to hear the music on my ipod at the volume I like. Sometimes the radio station comes in and starts playing over my music. I gave it 2 stars because it works ok *sometimes*. I just don't like it. :("
1,Does not work!,"This product does not work. I have tried using it with multiple different ipods(ipod, nano, mini), and have tried multiple different vehicles(crysler, honda, jeep, nissan, mazda, toyota), and i have tried using it in multiple different locations(mountains, hills, city, suburbs, valley, beach).nothing works. it charges the ipod fine, but will not transmitt an fm signal to a car radio. i have even parked my car outside my bedroom window and tried to pick up the signal with my home stereo system. it does not work.how can they advertise that it does something that it does not?i am very upset with my purchase,."
2,Beware static/channel selection,"Mega-static with this thing here in San Francisco; maybe it will work better out in the country.One unusual result I would like to share with everybody is that ""reception"" may actually be better on an occupied frequency than on an empty one. At least that was my experience. I would highly recommend trying all 8 frequencies, regardless of the quality of the broadcast signal they receive.I'm gonna look for a cassette-to-iPod connector, I'll sacrifice top quality sound to get rid of the static."
2,Listen to your IPOD in your car,"Finding a free frequency that works is dificult. When travelling, you get all kinds of static and interference. Going from Ipod to radio is a chore laoded with lots of loud static due to having to increase volume to hear your IPOD and then turning it down to keep from blowing your car speakers. The car charger does work OK."
2,Monster in the car,"It is neat, and convenient but prone to interference and random fuzz. It also is more in the way than the tape adapter that proceeded it because now there is this big thing hanging down. It's cool that I no longer have to worry about the batery dying though."
3,Works but misses some parts of the music,"The cable works technically fine. Directions are good, easy to use. However the music from the car speakers was missing some parts, e.g. higher treble parts, etc. Adjusting the radio did not help. It will fulfill a need but not as well as expected."
2,Ahhhhh,"Well, at first I bought a X Brand FM Transmitter really cheap , the Seller sent me a non working one and 4 weeks later I got my money back.Then I did a lot of research and this looks to me like the best option given the reviews and I went for it. I live in Miami and in my Rover it did not work that great. I still have a LOT and I mean A LOT of interference. So probably in your car could work in mine definitely do not."
2,"Great idea, but poor quality","I was given an iCar as a gift. I couldn't make it work,so returned it. It was faulty and replaced. Now after 3 weeks, the digital read out on my replacement has quit! I hope I can get it replaced.I took this on a road trip and found it necessary to retune 4 times in 400 miles due to interference, which became impossible when you can't read the frequency.I like the small size and the fact that the ipod is not ridgedly mounted, but it seems quality needs improved."
3,"A moderately adequate product, no more","When you are in an area away from a big city, this product is pretty good. In or near a big city, where 80% of the population lives, it is frustrating and fairly worthless. It is also rather pricey.Unless you live in a rural area, I'd say skip it."
1,Sadly Mistaken,"Either LOVE it or HATE it. I hated it. There was not a single radio station I could tune into that would work for more than a few miles, after that, Staticville set in. Be sure to have a BLANK station available wherever you drive before purchase."
2,Not impressed - sound quality is poor,"I purchased the Monster Cable iCarPlay and the Sony cassette adapter to do a side-by-side comparison when playing my iPod photo. The cassette adapter wins hands-down for sound quality. The pro's to having the Monster Cable iCarPlay are that 1) it charges the iPod 2) newer cars do not have a cassette deck, so when in a new car or renting a car or what have you, iCarPlay does the trick. For the sound quality though, it rates very low."
1,Too much static,"I live in St. Louis and have a Honda Civic. The Monster ipod adapter did not work very well at all. There was a lot of static no matter which radio station I used. I ended up returning the product. I have been told that the quality of sound that you get depends on where your car antenna is and where you are. Considering the price of the adapter and charger, I expected great sound quality. I was very disappointed."
2,Not for Nanos,"I recently purchased this product and had to promptly return it. The packaging and website said it works perfectly with the iPod Nano, but when I hooked it up... I got nothing. Not even the slightest sound. I tried hooking it up to my sister's Nano as well, but it didn't work on hers either. I know that it works really well with the Mini and iPod video, but if you're looking for something to work with your Nano, choose another product, because this one just isn't a fit at all."
1,Total Junk,"I bought two - one for me, and one for my wife. The first one just stopped working after a couple days. I returned it. The second one started out giving unbelievable static whenever you jiggled the cord - then the left channel died. I'm returning it, too. Seriously, don't waste your money!!"
1,Fire hazard!,"This is imported substandard trash. My first unit would not charge the ipod. I spent the time and money on returning it to Monster. I was once of the opinion that this company made high quality equipment. The replacement unit changed all that. On my first trip to work with it, I could smell a burning odor. It was dark out and I turned on the dome light to see smoke coming out of it! By this time the music had stopped and I quickly unplugged it. This thing could have set fire to my vehicle. When I emailed Monster about this, there was no response."
2,"Works, but with interference","Quite simply, the hiss/chirp that frequently occurs (sorta reminds you of playing a scratched CD) is irritating enough that you'll switch off your iPod. I bought this for a 2,000-mi road-trip and stopped using it after about 100 miles into the trip. Neither switching frequencies nor moving the iPod/wiring all around helped.Luckily, the car I used on my last road-trip had an AUX input (direct iPod to audio-jack connection) so I only used this gadget to keep the iPod charged. Ended up using the iPod the entire 4,600-mi trip!"
2,BAD sound quality...,"unless you live in the middle of a very unpopulated area with no other radio frequencies around...bad in/around city (and Providence, RI isn't That big of a city!)"
1,Very weak signal.,This product does not produce a strong enough signal to override interference caused by nearby radio signals. I suggest spending the extra $50+ and purchase a stereo input for your IPOD rather than trying to find a cheap alternative.
3,"Works, but audio has hiss and static.","Where I live there isn't any *COMPLETELY* clear FM station. (Near Dulles Airport, in the suburbs of Washington DC)Even on long road trips where I am in rural areas, the audio quality isn't that good. There is a little bit of hiss in the background and a little tiny bit of static.It really depends on the type of music. If you are listening to something with a full and complex sound, like most rock-n-roll, then you won't notice the hiss/static. But if you are listening to a solo vocal piece, or a slow piece of classical music, it is like listening to an FM station on the edge of reception."
2,Useless for listening,Within one week after purchasing this cable it started to cut out after 10-15 minutes of use. LED display goes dead and the FM station becomes noisy static. As it was I could never get a clean enough signal to make it worth listening to. I still use it to charge my iPod but that's about it.
3,you can do better,"For 70 bucks retail, you can do better. The sound is fine, but you are limited to to eight FM stations from which you may choose, so if they're all taken in your region, you're out of luck. I returned mine after a couple of days."
1,monster,Cable only worked part time.If i turned it off when i stopped it would not work.Called monster to return.
1,Don't buy this,"Manual is incorrect regarding how the network configuration is setup. It's DHCP out of the box, not a fixed 169.xxx.xxx.xxx address.It uses an obsolete filesystem, FAT32, that has many limitations regardling file and partition sizes.You must update the firmware to Basic-46 for this to work on the network.Minor point, this is the first device I've seen that defaults its time to the Beijing timezone.It makes a good USB enclosure, but you can get one of those for a third the price of this."
3,Acoustic Hitchcock part 3,"This is in the same sort of vein as Hitchcock's acoustic masterpieces ""Eye"" and ""I Often Dream of Trains,"" but not really in the same league. The sound quality is excellent, and considering this collection of mostly previously unreleased songs was recorded over a number of years it's remarkably coherent. Or should I say repetitive? There's a sense of sameyness about this low-key, reflective album that I find a bit tedious. On the other hand, with repeated listenings many of the songs begin to distinguish themselves, particularly ""Birdshead,"" one of Robyn's most beautiful songs ever. All in all a good album for late night listening, but not among his best."
3,headset,Seems to attenuatesome of the power out of an MP3 reducing the high volume by about 20%. Relatively comfortable and frequency response seems adequate except at the very high end. Good for the price.
1,yo yo yo,this is THE most hilarious thing i have ever heard!! if you want a good laugh listen to the preview snippet things. But uh...i wouldnt suggest on buying this.
1,terrable,this is the wost cd i just baut and only listened to the samples and didnt sound any thing like eminem its a very big discrace take it from me im one of the biggest fan from eminemhe is my idol
1,Not Eminem,"This is a true example that shows Marshall Mathers' talent. This is not Eminem, rather his lyrics and someone else performing them. No one can perform the true lyric that can cut sharper than any knife but Eminem. This is proven in this little record right here. All this is a blunder with a slightly different beat and some bad vocals."
1,a tribute....already?,"C'mon guys. Yes, this sounds like garbage...of another kind. But since M&M is garbage too, it is sort of a fitting tribute. But the name of the album really sent me into shock. A TRIBUTE? TO THIS GUY? C'mon, tributes are for 1) real artists, 2) artists who have had long and illustrious careers, and 3) because of number 2, artists whose material has stood the test of time and is still relevant several generations down the line. Mr. M does not fulfill any of these in the slightest way possible. What's next, a tribute to Aaron Carter?"
5,Guess Who's Back,"Aside from the Eminem show, this is the dopest disc I've ever heard. Da MC on this rips raw and does Eminem's music justice, true fans be down with this. Like one reviewer said ""this is off the hook like emienem at a spousal abuse trial."" I been down with Em since he was spitin' out rhymes on an open mic, he is a tru detroit player, prototype and untoppable, but like I says earlier I didn't waste my paper on this disc, it is aight and bling blingin' cheedah!"
1,That was [terrible].,"This should be called ""A Complete Mockary of Everything Eminem Has Worked Hard to Achieve"" because dear sweet jesus that was the single most awful thing I have ever heard ever. I feel as though this man has wasted ten minutes of my life and quite frankly, I would like them back. I hope, for his own sake, that this was intended to be a joke. May god have mercy on his soul."
1,what the hell is this?!,"This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard! Who is this guy doing eminem's songs and how did he get a CD? I could've done this myself. He can't even flow. If you buy this, then i have no pity for you."
1,Is this for real ?????,This is by far the worst thing I have ever heard.......How could anybody enjoy this. I wish Slim would hear it and beat that fool. How embarassed he must be
1,Disrespectful,"I love Eminem music. I can honestly say i am one of his biggest fans. This album is simply disrespectful to his lyrical and musical styling! As soon as i heard some of this, i wanted to puke! If you are a true Em fan, you will NOT buy this record!"
1,??????????,"If you're actually dumb enough to consider this garbage good, than please jump off a bridge. 'Nuff said."
1,MORONS!!!,"Ok Number one for those people who are saying this is a great CD they are obviously deaf, this CD sucks and blows at the same time, these guys should be wrapped in wet animal hides and thrown into the middle of an Arizona desert. HORRIBLE!!! Spare your ears and never listen to it EVER!"
1,What the hell,Okay this is going to be short. This is the worst CD ever. Who are these guys rappin? They have no timing and are all off beat plus the way they rap it just makes the songs sound bad. I would be so[upset]if I was Eminem and I heard the way they mangled the songs on this CD. It's not a tribute it's an insult! No true Eminem fan would disagree.I would have gave it no stars but the form made me. All in all this CD is just sad.
1,Please Believe It...,"The CD is horrible... every single aspect of it. Whoever these various artists are brutalize Eminem's tracks. Only bonus, is that the CD will make you laugh at exactly how bad these wannabes really are.The most amazing thing is that everythin is horribly off beat. Considerin that everythin here has been spit before by Eminem, there should be no question as to how to spit it. But naaaaaaah, the lyrics and delivery are all over the place, the best examples having to be ""I'm Back"" followed by ""Who Knew""...But the CD is pure comedy as long as you haven't paid money for it... just listen to the snippets and laugh a way, that's what I didOne..."
3,A tribute to eminem,"All you guys are smoking crack. This dude is not Eminem but he does not suck and this CD is awesome. I don't know but most of these reviewers don't have an open mind here. The CD is awesome for people who have heard all Eminem's stuff and want a change of style. Because Eminem's voice can get old specially when all his music has been played out by the world. I like Eminem and I'm not a hater, but if you were to ask me if I'd rather listen to this CD or any of Eminem's versions I'd say this CD. Maybe because it sounds a bit different then Eminem or I have heard to much Eminem threw the years and I lost taste for his squealy voice I dunno. One thing is for certain This CD seems more like a I don't give a ^%$# style then Em's. I'm 28 years old everything nowadays seems the same to me this CD kept me entertained."
1,What In The World?!?!?!?!?!,What is this crap?!?!?! This is no Slim Shady. Only a Eminem freak fan would buy this album. Who is this guy posing as Eminem? This is just stupid.Crazy.Retarted.Horrible. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,HELLO...............,I WAS THINK OF GET THIS THEN I LISTENED TO THE SAMPLES AND IT GAVE ME A GREAT IDEA ILL COVER HIS SONGS AND DO A TRIBUTE TOOIT WOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS PILE OF MONKEY $H!T
1,Worst CD i ever heard!,"I havent heard the actual CD, but from what i can tell from the preview clips, this is the worst CD ever! Maybe buy it if you want a good laugh, but i suggest that you don't."
1,Eminem Tribute?,This is the worst tribute album I have ever heard. They made this in a basement over a span of a day at least. The beats are ok but the rap part is horrible. They even made the D-12 and Dr Dre parts sound like ... . I hope whoever made this album and Eminem are ashamed.
1,wake up,"Umm...first of all if you are reading through these reviews let me give you one thing straight....this cd isn't Eminem guys, it's a lousy imitator with no sense of rhythm...just listen to the samples and you'll pick that up. This is what we like to call ""exploitive"" and for obsessed ... fans. Save yourself the time and frustration, if you like Eminem, go find one of his real cd's."
1,"This CD screams ""Pathetic""","If you're gonna make a tribute cd, use the orginal recordings, not some imitation. Nobody cares about that loser who tries to rap Em's songs. The guy's flow sounds nothing like Em's, and you can't even understand some of the words Mr. Eminem wannabe says. Anybody who bought this cd after they heard it is a real idiot."
1,If only there was an option to give this CD a ZERO,"How long did it take those wannabes to make this??? Twenty minutes? Half an hour? The songs sound horrible, every single one of them. They are off-beat and the tunes are all screwed up. The songs are not even close to the actual ones in quality. The expressions are horrible. They don't even match Slim Shady's. This CD is a disgrace, I wish I never bought it. Its too late to return it...anyways, I burned it in the fireplace."
2,"Eminem Music, NOT EMINEM","Big Eminem fan? Love the Eminem music? Go BUY some Eminem music (or DVDs). Skip this. Sure the songs are good and the lyrics rock, but Eminim brings the power to the music that these guys just don't have. Doesn't have the same edge or bring anything new to the music. Skip this and buy some real Eminem."
1,is this a tribute?,"Is this a tribute to eminem. I respect eminem. I like the way he talks about his life in his songs. This cd is one of the worst I have ever heard. Whoever made it really ... If I was eminem I would diss these guys in my songs. They ... Eminem is my favorite rapper and I bought this cd thinking it would be something good. Whatever u do, whether you buy this or not. My opinion is it ... Listen to Eminem not fakes eminems"
2,Not what I remembered,"My grandma had this story when I was growing up and we LOVED it, but I didn't remember it as being a ghost story. Her version had different illustrations that I liked quite a bit more. This wasn't what I had hoped for."
2,Incredible Tim Mahoney produces disappointing CD,"Maybe I'm being over critical because I want Tim to succeed, but I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD. What happened to Maybe, Come On, and Follow -- all excellent songs that were slated for the CD?I think this CD was over produced by Marlon Young. Even the small tweaks to Shine wrecked the magic compared the original Shine released many months ago.... I even question the order of the songs, why ""Our King"" instead of something like ""Bleed"". I can't believe ""Shine"" is buried as the 10th track.It's hard to promote this CD knowing Tim has so much more to offer.PS. Sounds clips can be heard at ...(on the web) under Discography. Listen before you buy...."
2,"My dogs don't like, maybe yours would?",I have 2 english bulldogs and for some reason they would rather get food out of a bone then use these.
1,Easily Destroyed,My dog destroyed this item in less than one evening. I would not recommend it for strong chewers. It seems to come apart easily at the open end.
1,Not as strong as advertized. My APBT demolished it!,"I bought this toy from a pet store near my house. I asked an employee what the strongest chew toy they had in the store was and he showed me the Kong Extreme. I explained to him that my Blue Fawn - American Pit Bull Terrier has chewed through literally every dog toy I have bought him, and even every bone I have bought him. The employee swore to me that there was no way that a dog could chew through this, so I figured I would give it a try. Sure enough, I bring the toy home, and within 10 MINUTES (no exaggeration) the entire top portion of the toy was completely chewed up and in bits all over the floor. Needless to say, I brought it back and got a refund. Just a fair warning, the Kong Extreme is not as strong as advertised."
4,"KONG Extreme Dog Toy, Large, Black",I have a p7up (sheapard) and he loves this toy. Chases all over the house and it is very sturdy and still holding up well under his rough house
1,not as extreme as it says!,this toy broke the first day!!! i need a replacement!!! i really hope i can get a new one my dog loved it
3,kong,lasted 1 month dog loves it. she chewed the top off. there should be a life time warranty or something like that
2,My dog ate it,I thought it was suppose to be extra strong but my vizsla still broke it into pieces. disappointed. k k
1,"big promises, poor delivery","purchased this for my year old pitmix who tore thru the red one quickly -unfortunately same story here -maybe last 2 hours til it was in pieces -might try the blue but am beginning to think the ""tougher"" claim is all marketing-also have concerns about the toxicity of the product."
1,chewed up in one week,extreme? indestructible? not so much. my blue heeler had this thing shredded in small pieces within a week...
1,WOW,Well I was very disappointed with this product. I have a lab mix and he just destroyed this in about an hour. My husband and I were so shocked. We couldnt believe how fast he demolished it. Not worth the money!
2,sent me wrong size,i ordered medium and they sent me small. :( wasn't happy... BUT was supprised that even the small one... my medium dog enjoyed and has NOT torn appart! Black kongs are the way to go! SO durrable!
2,"Too small , not what I expected",This kong is really only good for very small dogs. I have a 50 lbs pit mix and I was scared she was going to swallow these whole. She tore through them very quickly. I've used the larger size Kongs before and they work very well.
3,Not tough enough for my dog.,"I bought the small extreme kong for my 7 lb yorkiepoo thinking this would be safer than the stuffed animals she likes to dismember. She loves the kong, but she had it chewed up within 2 days. I guess I will have to switch to rawhide or some other edible chew toy. I wish the kong would have lasted, because my doggy had so much fun with it and kept herself entertained while trying to get the treat out."
1,Kong Gone in first few minutes,"This toy is not safe for an unsupervised dog! I got my Jack Russell the smaller version (medium) of the one we gave our Rotweiler (large). The Large Black Kong we've had for years but it seemed too big for our Jack Russell to enjoy so we got him the smaller black ""indistructible"" kong. It came with a treat so I stuck it in there. He loved it and then began peeling off pieces of rubber like they were post-it notes. I wonder if I didn't put the food in the hole if he would have ripped it appart like he did (althought I took out the treat myself and gave it to him so he wouldn't eat the toy). I think the smaller Kong is just not as durable as the bigger one and was a waste of 12 dollars for me, with which I could have bought stuffed toys and let them squeak and pull fluff for at least an hour of entertainment."
3,fun toy,"My grandaughters like putting peanut butter in it. This is not a throw toy because it bounches crazy. My dog will play with it, but only when loaded with peanut butter."
4,good product but definitely NOT large!,"This is a very durable chew toy that, in the past, has lasted well with my mastiffs. I ordered it online, thinking I would get a replacement for the one that had been lost but when it arrived, it was MUCH smaller than expected. THis size is perfect for a 50lb dog, but (as I later found) you need to get the XXL size for a mastiff. Oh well. Gave it to the neighbor's dog and will get the right size for my boy."
5,Excellent!,"As so many of these reviews have already stated, these are THE toy to have if your dog is an aggressive chewer. I have a 65lb pit bull mix that loves chewing and destroys so many different kinds of toys in just seconds. This one, however, holds up beautifully.We stuff the Kong with peanut butter, dried beef treats, and other goodies and freeze it for a couple of hours. Keeps her entertained for at least an hour. We play fetch with it and bounce it...great exercise! We've had ours for a month, with her playing/eating/chewing it every day and it hasn't broken yet. She did get into our smaller Kong and managed to chew the top off, but this one seems to be perfect.We have had great luck with Kong products so far and can't wait to try more. Highly recommended for long-lasting entertainment."
4,"Strong, but not indestructible","This is much firmer than the other toys I've tried. As long as treats are inside, he just went for those, but once my dog (an 8-month old boxer puppy) finished off the treats inside, he ripped through it pretty easily. I had to get it away from him pretty quick so I could still use it for treats. In short, it's a good product, but not indestructible. The KONG Wobbler on the other hand, he hasn't even put a dent in yet, and I haven't taken it away from him once."
5,a really good toy!,"This is a great toy for an extreme chewer! Make sure you don't skimp on the size though, it's important that it's not too small for them."
3,Be Careful with Extreme Chewers,I have a ridgeback boxer mix who likes to destroy things. The only toy that's withstood her chewing is a solid rubber ball. I got the Extreme Kong thinking that it'd last. PAY ATTENTION when your dog first plays with it. She went at it as soon as I gave it to her. Then I left her alone for 5 minutes. When I got back she had split it in half. At that point I let her go at it and it was in shreds after 20 minutes. 3 stars because I left her to destroy it but she had fun doing it for a bit.
1,"Extreme, really?","We have 3 dogs -- 1 small, 1 medium and 1 large breed -- and as puppies, each teethed on a Puppy Kong. As adults, they can tear apart the Puppy Kongs, which isn't too surprising since they're designed to be softer. We bought this product because we thought it would hold up for a few years. It only lasted a few weeks. Our Gordon Setter pulled the small end off, and we don't buy Kong products anymore."
3,Really small kong,"We purchased this for our golden retriever puppy, but it's really too small even for her. You'd need a really small dog for this to be the appropriate size."
5,good,good item and it shipped very fast the dog likes itHowever I think our dog would prefer a bigger one. He is big.
1,Too small,"These are definitely too small for big chewers. Not really sure why they make these it is seems backwards to the whole thinking of big chewer. A little dog wouldn't need the black Kong, but whatever."
2,Kong toy,It was smaller than we thought and not good for our Shepard. Will give it to a friend that has a smaller dog.
3,black kong-size large,"I was disappointed when I opened the box and the ""large kong extreme"" was so small. My 65lb. Golden Doodle lost interest in it in only a short time."
4,great for a LAB!,My lab loves this product and he is a strong chewer. We have been using it for over 2 years and so far so good.
4,For Agressive Chewers,"Still the best item out there for agressive chewers. That doesn't mean your dog won't eventually manage to get it ripped apart, but it does take longer than anything else out there. Much better than the Orca toys which only take minutes to destroy."
2,Dog destroyed it,"I was really hoping this toy would be the magic ticket that we needed for our dog, but it lasted a day and a half. He got through it and started chewing on the tiny pieces. So glad we were there to see it and got it away from him before he choked! P.S. He's a Pit/Boxer mix, maybe other dogs wouldn't be able to get through it."
1,Not for my dog,My 40 pound pitbull had the top quarter of it off in minutes. If you have a pitbull I would suggest a Deer Antler Bone.
3,"The ""Large"" is too small","I purchased size ""large"" for my 100 lb rottweiler. For a 'large' this thing was small. My rottie could swallow it. Large is more appropriate for a dog the size of a cocker spaniel."
2,Should be re-named small-medium Kong,"The toy was described as ""large"" but was actually one of the smaller Kong toys on the market right now. Dissappointing since my dog is 90 lbs!"
1,Not what they used to be!,"My coton de tulear/poodle had Kong's that lasted well over a year....until now. He broke the last red Kong a month ago, so we tried this black extreme Kong--it was broken in half within the first half hour of him using it! He has figured out that he can break off the top one third of the Kong where it goes in with his teeth! No more Kong's for us---we can't afford the replacement weekly (daily!)."
4,"Neat little toy, lasts quite a while","I have a young lab that usually destroys any toy we give him. So I bought this, thinking it would be a much more durable solution. On that front, I'm not disappointed. In the six months we've had it, the most he's managed is a could of marks on the exterior. He loves to chew it and really gets a kick out of chasing it. Be aware though, this is a monster of a toy. When throwing it indoors, be aware that it bounces in a random and unexpected fashion and could damage something if it manages to hit it. Honestly, we havent used the treat reservoir function a lot either, as he gets a kick out of it either way. I recommend this both for the price and longevity."
1,Good News/Bad News,The good news is that my 70 lb. Labradoodle loves this and almost any other chew toy. The bad news is that it took her about an hour to tear it into tiny pieces. If you have a strong chewer then this is not the right toy for them (but what is).
1,Don't buy the black Kong!,"My dogs are big-time Kong fans. I bought a large one of these and it stained my carpet. The black version feels almost oily and petroleum-based, so it rubs off on fabric and carpets. The red ones never did that. I wouldn't recommend this model at all."
4,Kong extreme,"My dog loves this toy but, I was shocked at the small size for $8.95 This is a bit small for a large dog! Oh, well......"
3,Didn't last 20 minutes,We bought the large Kong Extreme for our 9 month lab who is a chewer. We have to take the regular Kong away from him after the treat is gone from it or he will destroy it. I gave this one to him with no treat in it at all to test its strength and it didn't last 20 minutes. He had the end chewed off and it was thrown away. He only weighs 49 pounds but we might have to buy the largest size and see it that lasts longer. Otherwise it is a good product if you don't have a chew monster.
1,Lasted 1/2 a day...,"We just got a 15-month old boxer/lab mix from the shelter. First toy was gone in a couple of hours, so the pet store recommended the large Extreme Kong. Lasted 1/2 a day. She totally chewed off the small end and left pieces of place rubber all over the house. Marley isn't even 35lb, so thought Large would be good enough. Have been told repeatedly that these are great toys, so think we're going to try the Extra Large size and hope that she can't tear that one to shreds."
1,Dangerous toy for chewing dog under 50 lbs,Top ring of this toy was able to be chewed off within 30 minutes by a 15 year old shepard. No food was in toy. He weighs under 50lbs.
1,"Sammy one, Kong zero","As much as I'd like to say this toy was a five-star product, alas, it was not to be. I had high hopes that this would be the one toy that my bully mix would not be able to destroy. But she had it for only 10 minutes and had it destroyed to the point that I had to throw it away. If you have and extreme chewer like I do, this toy may not be for your dog, either."
1,Don't waste your money,"We have a 34 pound Staffordshire Bull Terrier pup who is only nine months old, it took him less than three hours to rip a chunk of rubber out of the top of this toy. We bought the extreme Kong, which is supposed to be tougher, and even bought it in the size for 60+ pound dogs, as recommended for power chewers. He left marks and gouges all over the smaller end, then took a bite out of it the size of a marble. I had to throw it away. He loved the toy, wouldn't put it down, but it was a waste for the cost in the long run. Rope toys and rawhide bones last far longer."
2,Not very large at all.,I thought this kong would be large as it states. It is small and my dog chewed through it immediately. I was hoping for a bigger more durable chew toy.
3,A little disappointed,"This is the wrong size kong for my dog. She is an 80lb retreiver and the hole on it is too small. It said it was a large, so I ordered 2. Now I am stcuk with 2 toys she cannot play with becuase the opening is too small.It would be helpful if they maeasured and posted the circumfrence of the hole so you can estimate if your dog can get their tongue in there."
2,kong is really not extreme,"If you have a big dog, this toy didn't last more than an hour; well, at least for my dog it didn't. Any medium or small dog would enjoy this a lot longer though. I have a black lab and he took the smaller part and spitted it out in a heart beat so this Kong toy wasn't challenging enough for him. Majority of the reviews were positive so I decided to give it a try, but just like any other time, toys don't last longer than a few hours."
1,My dog won't play with it......,"I did everything I knew how to get our 9yr old pooch to play with this, but Buddy would have none of it. They smelled like old tires, and left a rubber smell on my hands. I washed them over and over, and even when treats were put inside of them, once the treats were out, Buddy was done with the toy...back to his worn tennis balls.To make matters worse, the toys looked so cute I got two of them, different styles. Now there are 2, rubber-smelling dog toys in Buddy's box that he'll have nothing to do with. :-("
2,Not for pit bulls!!,"I have to admit I've always trusted Kong and their products for being extremely durable. But realistically, these toys do not stand up to the powerful jaws of my pits. 30mins after receiving the product, this toy was in several tiny pieces. Also, the idea of the item being labeled as large is a bit misleading. The item is actually small. So if you're looking for a large, you will need to order XXlarge. Probably a good chew toy for a less powerful chewer like a doberman or shepard type dog."
2,Our 33 lbs pup destroyed the X-Large Extreme Kong,"Our new 33 lbs youngster chewed the rubber off two-thirds of the way around the large opening of the BLACK EXTREME EXTRA Large Kong. The rubber on said Kong, I found, is much softer and more pliable than the red Kong we purchased the other day. Too bad I can't include a picture. He's never had a Kong and is still learning how to get small broken pieces of treats to fall of it before progressing to treats that don't fall out, but he gives up after a a few minutes, This isn't a dog whose jaws have been strengthened by chewing on it. His mouth is too small to get around the large end. The company response was that they only guarantee rubber products for 30 days."
1,Poor Quality,"Surprisingly, the regular version of Kong works better. This is said to be ""extreme"" for ""power chewers,"" yet it was chewed up in just 1-2 days. The regular (cheaper) red Kongs seem to last much longer."
3,Small but sufficient.,I have seen much larger Kongs that this so I'm not sure why it is considered large??? This is perfect who dogs who love to chew. My pit however doesn't prefer this toy and I am not sure why. I think maybe in a month he might take to it better when he begins chewing more often.
3,"Laster longer than most, but not forever","Our 19lb Shiba Inu is fantastic at shredding toys. Her favorite pasttime is eviscerating anything stuffed, and shredding anything rubber. We knew a regular kong would not stand up, but we figured a black kong would do better. Sure enough, it was almost a day before she chipped off her first piece. It lasted about 3 months before it was so shredded we were afraid she would tear off a chunk big enough to hurt her.Honestly, 3 months for a rubber chew toy isn't too bad considering her normal habits. Certainly not indestructible, but tougher than most.One tip for those looking for a fun way to stuff it: plug the small hole with penut butter, stick a small treat midway in, fill it with water and freeze it. Our girl could clean penut butter out in about 7 minutes normally, but the frozen treat lasted a lot longer."
3,Lasts a little bit longer...,"My dog (45lb) can get about 2 weeks out of a large black kong before the middle of it is really chewed-up. Fortunately, no chunks have come off the half-dozen or so we've consumed over the past few months. I was hoping for a little more durability."
5,durable for my extreme chewers,"I bought this over a year ago, and it's in the same condition now as it was back then. My dogs are extreme chewers, and this thing has stood the test of time. They usually play with it only if it has peanut butter inside. It's pretty big & clunky, and I can always hear it when my dog drops it. It has left a couple black marks on my wall, but they were easily wiped off."
2,destroyed within 30 minutes,"I purchased this for a small Pit Bull who weighs around 50 lbs and I haven't found anything she's interested in other than rope toys, which she shreds and swallows. A couple of treats were placed inside, she was excited to have the new toy, and after she'd played with it a bit, she ripped open the bottom and enjoyed the treats. The ""extreme"" KONG is now useless. It would probably be ok for one of my Min Pin or Rat Terrier fosters, but not for many that fall into the weight range for this toy. Dang it!"
1,24 hours,We had this KONG Extreme for less than 24 hours and our 50 lb. Lab chewed it to shreds. The purchase from Amazon was a great experience but the product was terrible.
4,puppies,gift for animal shelter dogs and cats that don't have a forever home yet - wanted to bring some joy to their lives since I can't adopt them all.
3,Meh.,"The plastic cracked within a few days of our pitbull/rottweiler chewing on it. If she hadn't lost it in the yard, I'm sure she would have destroyed it within the month."
2,It lasted 3 days!,"So I ordered this becasue my boxer/lab mix (Roxy) destroyed her last kong, the red one. I was hopeful that this would last longer than the old one did due to the reviews that I read. I got this delivered to my house on a Wednesday and by Saturday it was dead. She had ripped it to pieces. Roxy loved it while it lasted but I have the worst time trying to find fun toys for her that she can't destroy. Oh well...she loved it while it lasted!"
5,Great to keep them busy,My Rotti loves his kongs. I fill with his biscuits and seal the top with some cheese. Keeps him busy for at least 15 mins :)
3,Ok Product,Would be perfect if my adult boxer was able to get to the snack. Maybe I ordered the the wrong size. The price and fast delivery is unbeatable.
3,Dogs only play with it if its got treats in it,Very durable but my two dogs only play with it if there are treats inserted in it. Does make for a good treat toy.
4,She likes it,"My fifty pound labradoodle enjoys the chewing and chasing the Kong's unpredictable bounces. She does seem to greatly prefer it with something good inside. I've used hot dogs, peanut butter, and soft cream cheese. Perhaps that's spoiled her since she largely ignores the toy if nothing is in it. It has proven to be reliably sturdy for all its dropping and chewing."
1,Too small,"I have a Rottweiler, and since the label says LARGE, I thought I was buying the right size. Unfortunatly this is much too small for a Rottweiler. I would be a good size for a medium/small dog."
5,"High quality, lasts forever!",I bought two of these 4.5 months ago and they are still in one piece and I have a black lab who is a super chewer so that is a very impressive feat! I will buy more once these give out and will recommend to any dog owner!
2,Dogs didnt like it,"Durable bouncy but dogs just didn't like it put peanut utter , meat and treats in it they just were not interested in this toy. So now its sits in the corner of the yard of dedicated to the graveyard of forgotten and beat up toys. R.I.P. Kong toy"
3,Still not strong enough,"Our pittie pup (<1) completely destroyed the red kong in 2 days. This one took her a week or two, but she still managed to tear it apart."
2,Small,"This said it was a large toy. I guess KONG's standards are different from mine because I don't consider this large at all. I have a Lab and this would not have survived his chewing. I returned it. Amazon is great about returns, and I had no problems with my return process or refund."
4,so far so good,So far this toy has lasted longer then any other toy i have gotten my dog. (normally they are dead with in a day or two this one has made it throught the week)
2,My 9.8 pound mini doxie........,"chewed the top right off of this in a matter of 30 minutes. On the up side, once he got the top off he left the rest intact, but now it's pretty easy for him to get to the contents I put inside. I actually wish I would never have bought the Kong because now he won't touch a Nylabone. At least a Nylabone would last him 3 or 4 days. Also, he put on weight because of the kong. This toy sounds like it works for other dogs, but it doesn't work for mine. Might be worth a try for most folks."
2,Nothing is forever,"My dog went through two of the classic red kongs in about 3 weeks. The ""extreme"" black kong lasted her about a month. This toy did last longer but it is by no means indestructible."
2,Better off with Large bone,"Our two year old lab had this thing chewed up in less than 45 minutes. A large bone will last just as long, plus your dog won't swallow the small rubber pieces that it chews up."
1,i messed up,love kongs thougt i was ordering a giant one little one was useless to me did not know how to return
1,Easily destroyed,"My dog destroyed this ""extreme"" toy in less than a day--I caught him tearing off pieces of rubber and eating them. Not recommended."
1,Kong,It was bought at Ross Dress for Less for 2.99. If you are going to buy your stuff from there and resell it at least take off the price tag. my dog won't even go near it. it smells and taste like a tire. even when it is loaded with the treats he loves.
1,Kong Extreme,VERY disappointed in this product! Gave it to my 11 month old Rottweiler and he had chewed the top off in 1 1/2 HOURS! Product said it was VERY durable even used to train German Sheperds. Will not buy this again.
2,It's Not That Great,"I bought 2 of these because I loved the concept-- indestructible, chewable, fill 'em with peanut butter. Sounded awesome. However, the 3 big dogs who I have given these to were not impressed. They would much rather have rawhide chewies or real bones. These were a total waste of money for me."
5,"Always durable, always fun!","If you have a dog that rips his toys apart like mine then you need a Kong. It's always hard to find toys that are durable and entertaining to my dog, we've tried countless thick fabric dog toys but he was always very bored with them until he'd find the corner to gnaw at until the stuffing came out.The kongs are simply amazing, if there is a treat in the kong my dog will be entertained for a great deal of time and since its so durable they always hold up. This isn't my first dog's first kong, got him a new one because I think he buried his old one.I bought the large size of this toy and its a perfect size for my standard poodle (60 lbs).Great product, durable fun!"
3,"not so ""LARGE""","I purchased this item for my pit mix because she is a strong chewer. She has destroyed many kongs. I thought that this one being labeled ""LARGE"" would be big enough. It really isn't. If you have a dog that is an aggressive chewer, purchase the next size up (XL) I guess.. this one is not really sufficient for my dog (46#)."
5,Great for strong chewers,This is the only toy that my lab mix and Bouvier have not tore up. They are both strong chewers and these have held up great. They have had them for a month now and they are still intact.
4,Great,I have a pit and she has chewed up everything that's claimed to be strong. This one so far is holding up other than some tiny little pieces. If anything gets chewed off it'll be the smaller end but its not at that point yet
4,takes a bit of training for first time users,"It took my pug a week or so to get use to retrieve the food from in there, and when it's packed too tight she doesn't want to work that hard to get what's at the bottom, but she does love it, and it's very easy to clean. The only problem I have with it is that even after a month of weekly use it still smells like plastic A LOT!"
2,This is not the same as the one in the stores,"This Kong is MUCH smaller than the Large Xtreme kong that you see in pet stores. We have a large dog, but it keeps her occupied so we kept it."
5,"Solid build quality, my pup loves it!",I have a 2 year old chihuahua who has destroyed just about every single toy that i have given her but kong has been by far the most durable. These are great for use with treats though my dog is an expert at getting them out now so I have to continuously adapt treats and placement!
3,Always buy a size up,"My foster dog is a really strong chewer. She is only 33lbs so I thought the medium extreme kong would be fine. She completely destroyed in within the few hours I left her alone...I'll try the larger size, but I don't have high hopes."
2,Dont buy for a PitBull...Go for the XXLarge instead.,I bought this for our new puppy but our 2 year old (60lb)pitbull got hold of it and chewed the top off if it in under three minutes....Kongs are Great Toys but if you have a Pitbull then I would suggest that you only buy the Black Kong Extreme Toys in XX Large or they will most likely not last very long.
5,Best dog toy ever!,"Like many out there, I enjoy making my dog happy. I have a 9 year old German Shepard who still acts like a puppy. Only problem is that she tears every toy to shreds by chewing it endlessly. Now, I purchased the Large Kong and she absolutely loves it! Her favorite toy by far. She can chew it endlessly and will never destroy it! It has been about 2 months so far with it, and no damage. in addition, she lost weight and is now down to her healthy size! Less stress on her hips and joints :). Also, it is fun watching her chase this toy. If you throw it hard at the ground, it will wip and bounce across the yard, as if it is running from the dog. No doubt, all medium to large dogs will love this toy!"
2,Had for a year- just realized where the black tar stains came from!,"I have many Kongs as I have my own dog and foster dogs at my house. The Kongs I have had over the years have all held up pretty well and I have been more than pleased with them. Having so many different Kongs, I have not used this one on a regular basis. Over the past year I have noticed occasional black tar like stains on dog beds or blankets. I had thought that the dogs had gotten into something odd in the backyardbut I just saw where the black Kong had stained a cardboard container it had been stored by with black streaks. I put my fingers in the Kong and my fingers were covered with a black tar like substance which was not easy to clean off!? Never seen this but now I realize the source. I have thrown it away and will stick with the other Kongs going forward!"
5,The Kong is the King of dog toys!!,I have a pit bull and the Kong is the only toy thats strong enough to last. Normally she rips toys up in the first hour she gets them but the kong last months!!!!!! LOVE THE KONG!!!
1,Not durable enough for a Boston Terrier,Buster the three year old Boston Terrier chewed off 1/3 of the rim of the Extreme Kong within 10 minutes.
3,Find something stronger for the hardcore chewers,"I have an American Pit Bull Terrier that goes through these in about a week. She doesn't care whether or not there's filling in them; she just destroys them completely. I've been through 2 to keep her occupied while I'm at work, but they don't really last long enough to be worth the price. I recommend something stronger, even if it's more expensive, for the mega chewers like bully breeds."
2,Not so indestructable.,"I have 2 ""strong chewers"", a 40lb Australian Kelpie and 100lb Rottweiler. Good for the Kelpie, unfortunately the Rottie is tearing this to pieces right before my eyes as I type. And now the little one is scrambling for the left over bits. Anyone have any suggestions for strong chewers besides Nylabone?"
4,Not indestructible but lasts longer than anything else,"It took a few months of hard chewing before the Extreme Kong started coming apart. We're on our second one now. We'll see if he learned the ""sweet spot"" and will chew this one up faster."
4,Kong Toy for Dogs,while the kong is a great toy for our dog this one is labeled large yet it is more a medium size. If you are looking for a toy for a large dog (ours weighs 60-65lbs) I would order the extra large.
5,Da Bomb,This is a very awesome toy. My dog can pretty much destroy anything and he can't destroy this. He is a retriever but is an extreme chewer. Great toy for stuffing dry or wet food inside or any sort of wet treat.
1,Useless Item,"Our dog, a mixed lab and chow (75lbs) did not even know what to do with this! We put all kinds of food -- peanut butter, cheese, steak, etc. but he could not get any of these out of the small hole. And our dog is quite strong! It is a waste of money."
5,My 15 month old GSD is in love,"While I did expect the large Kong with frozen peanut butter to keep Romeo occupied for more than two hours, I'm overly pleased with it anyway. He loves it and the peanut is a fun, healthy treat."
3,American Bully/Pitbulls,Make sure your buy the correct size for your dog. I purchased four different sizes before I found the correct one. Even so my dogs don't care for it.
2,Not good for actual extreme chewers,"This lasted all of an hour or two before the top was chewed off and the next day, it was in pieces. Save your money and buy one of the Everlasting Treat toys instead. My dog hasn't destroyed the toy and it's refillable as well (though he eats that within s day or two, so ours is often empty). I would also recommend Nylabones, but Kong doesn't make anything that lasts more than a day our two in my house & my dog is only a 45 lb beagle mix."
2,Item was very small,This dog toy is not large. It is small and won't work for a large dog. i would suggest an extra large product.
3,Large?,My dog really enjoys eating his dog food from the kong. it keeps him busy and so far(fingers crossed) it held up. I gave it three stars because it should be larger for larger breeds.
5,Durable chew toy,"Our 4 month malamute puppy enjoys this toy, and loves looking for treats we hide inside. He doesn't actually chew on it much, but I'm assuming he will more when he's older. For now he just prefers his soft plush toys and bully sticks. This Kong is great for putting peanut butter inside also, and it's easy to clean. I've found it's dishwasher safe as long as it's not heat or steam dried. All in all it's a great toy and seems so stand up to all the playing and chewing that will certainly happen eventually. I recommend buying this product if you have a chewer or a dog that likes to entertain himself by trying to get treats out of things!"
3,for rewards,"I did not expect that my dog would beable to destroy this so quickly, After her first treat she had taken off a piece of it"
1,NOT EXTREME ENOUGH,"I have an extreme boxer/pit chewer who destroyed this in half an hour. The small ring part split off. Thought it was just a fluke, so I returned and got a replacement that was destroyed in the same exact fashion. If your dog destroys every toy, this is not extreme as it claims to be. I've had better luck with the Kong balls which are solid as a rock. Plus, the treat stuffer contains wheat, which didn't agree with him."
5,GREAT for jaws of destruction!,"I have a 4.5 year old 70 LBS. Doberman Pinscher that has destroyed other sizes of Kongs but she can't do it to this one.I even bought them for a friend that has 2 Boxers that have also destroyed other sizes of Kongs.My Dobie can go through toys, bones, and other things in weeks, if not days, but not this Extreme Kong.The only other toy that has survived her teeth is the Kong Ball for medium/large dogs and is red.I've never had it get lodged on her lower jaw as 1 person wrote and Dobies have narrow mouths.They can easily be washed in the dishwasher and are tons of fun for the dog as they throw it around and it bounces all over the place.I've wasted tons of money on other toys that were just shredded in days but the money spent on this Kong and the Kong Ball have been well worth it!"
4,Kong Extreme,"I bought this mostly for a German Shepherd puppy, but also with the possibility of our older German Shepherd liking it. We've had it for five months now and its none the worse for wear. Some reviewers mentioned that it stinks - it sure does. My dogs don't seem much interested in chewing on it, but if theres something inside like a small rawhide piece or a treat they seem to like it well enough. I like to put a bit of peanut butter in the opening and it keeps them (even the older dog) busy for a while. The special fetch ball seems to have gone missing and in it's stead the Kong toy does great. It bounces crazy, but the puppy still goes after it vigorously. The hole to put stuff into also makes a nice gripping place for his teeth. Overall not a bad toy. They don't really chew on it, but it has provided entertainment and it's still in one piece."
3,Not for every dog,"I have had three cocker spaniels and one jack russell terrier. Only one cocker spaniel liked this and it wasn't among his favorite toys. I don't like to put food in their toys, so I didn't try that. I don't think that extra food should be the only reason why a dog plays with a toy and the design of this seems like it would make it hard to clean out. My dogs are not picky, but this was not for them."
1,"second try, second time disappointed.","I have a nearly 8 month old terrier mix who chews through any toy as if it's his job. We've seen toys with all sorts of guarantees be finished off in a day. People always praise Kong, but our experience has not been a good one. Within 2 hours of having licked his first round of peanut butter out of the Kong, he had gnawed his way through the so called extreme toy--keep in mind my pup weighs 12 lbs. Our first experience was with a normal Kong, and that lasted longer, but he did not have all of his adult teeth at that time. I know people who love Kong, but apparently our 12 lb. beast is just too much for their rubber.I would recommend looking into the tux dog toy!"
1,Quite the opposite...Not for extreme chewers,"I bought this item thinking it was going to be any different then the other kongs, but I was very wrong. After my dog got all the peanut butter from the inside, she chewed the thing right up. It didn't even last for 15 minutes before she completely destroyed it. This is not a good product for extreme chewers. The only thing that's lasted on my dog is the nylabone, we are going on 6 months with that. If you have an extreme chewer, do not buy this item. It will be a huge waste of your money."
3,Not AmStaff-proof!,"We adopted a young American Staffordshire Terrier with jaws of steel who managed to make short work of a red Kong (amongst a variety of other shredded toys) that had lived through multiple other dogs. After numerous failed toy experiments, we decided to try the black Kong Extreme in a desperate attempt to find something that would survive the big guy; within 10 minutes he had removed the top of the Kong and it was added to the retired pile with all of the others. I did not give it a lower ranking because, although it could not withstand the death jaws of the extremely destructive AmStaff, it is a great toy for our moderately destructive Corgi. The search continues . . . ."
1,Would not recommend,"My dog Sasha had this thing torn up into mini pieces in record time. It sounded like a good buy, more or less indestructible. Not so. It was trash in no time. Definite waste of money."
1,Total Crap,I ordered this for a 9 year old Pitbull who loves to chew. The description says this toy is for 'serious chewers' that weigh 30-65 pounds. (My dog weighs 55lbs). Long lasting ... blah blah blah. My dog had it for 4 hours the first night and I saw teeth marks already. I thought it was no big deal. Tonight (second night) he had it for 2 hours and when I turned around it was in tiny pieces all over my floor. :(Kong is supposed to be the best out there for chewers - and Kong extreme is supposed to be even better. Total crap. What a waste of $10. I will stick with nylabone - they hold up for a few weeks at least.
2,Large Kong dog toy,"my pointer mix chewed this toy to pieces in about 2 hours. chewed a second one in half in a few more hours. the description states it is indestructible, i guess both of mine were defective. sent them back and the other two unused ones as well."
5,Tough Product,"The Kong Extreme is an excellent product. As you'll likely know from the product description, it's intended to be used w/ some sort of treat stuffed inside the toy. As a stand-alone toy, this thing is extremely durable and will last a lifetime.I'd recommend purchasing along with the other Kong treats designed to fit snuggly inside this toy, so you don't have to waste time cutting/reshaping other treats."
1,Dangerous,"I have a 90LB one-year-old black lab that completely destroys all toys...even KONGs. But this large black one finally was indestructable. Only problem is that his lower jaw got stuck in the toy. This happened in an instant during supervised play. It was jammed so bad that he had to be put under fully by a vet so that the toy could be drilled off. His gums were shredded from him yelping and flailing around trying to get it off. KONG assumes no responsibility for their unsafe toy. They have a tedious claim process that is designed to make you give up. I'm not trying to sue them or anything...just a little compensation for the vet bills....maybe just a refund for the toy?? I've read blogs stating that this same incident has happened to many others. So stay away from KONG unless you are OK with paying the vet and having an unhappy puppy. I stand by my review. If you want pictures of our injured dog...email me. thumpertonmildly@gmail.comThanks for reading,Dave"
2,Such high hopes,"We just received this last night, and our almost 11 month old pitbull was definetly very focused on it, and it did keep him busy for a little less than an hour before he tore it apart. I've never purchased a Kong before so I have no basis for comparison. It seems like a reasonably sturdy rubber, but definetly not indestructable, especially for any medium to large dog. I wouldn't say never for a different dog, but one would really have to watch them closely because the piece that was broken off could have easily been swallowed. Also, once the first bit is broken off, the pup realized he had found the weak point..from there to let him continue would have been dangerous. Definetly NOT SUITABLE to be left in crate with the dog."
2,"Strong, but not strong enough","I have purchased several black Kongs over the years, and I would highly recommend this product to people with small dogs or little puppies. Overall I really like this toy but my main problem with it is that it can be destroyed very easily!Although Kongs are advertised as ""Virtually Indestructible"" and ""For Aggressive Chewers,"" my 6 month old lab puppy can tear a XL black one apart in a few hours. The Kong was great for her when she was smaller but now I can't trust her with it without my supervision. Here are a few pros and cons of this toyPros1.Hours of fun and entertainment for your dog2.Great for stuffing with treatsCons1.Not very strong, can be torn up easily!!!!!!!"
3,"Egghead, not worth it","I am currently halfway through this book. The odd thing is that throughout the book, you get the feeling that you are reading a monumental book. The wealth of historical data that he brings to bear is huge. But somehow, it always turns out to overanalyzed and incohesive. The psychological models used are done so rigorously but to what real effect? He picks up a different model every couple pages; it makes you wonder if he actually supports any of them. This book lacks the formulation of broad theories on leadership that make a John Gardner book or a Howard Gardner book so great. If you are looking for a lot of historical background on leaders, this is a great place to look. If you are looking to become a better leader, look elsewhere."
4,Good for all leaders to be,Easy to read and understand. Great points to learn in this book if you are in a position of leadership or inspiring to be a great leader.
5,a true survivor,"i first read stephania when i was 9 years old back in 1964. a copy was given to my mother and i picked it up and read it. i kept the old black-backed copy from back then and had it with me for years. it wasn't until about 5 years ago that i read it again as an adult and got the full meaning of the novel. i wish my mother were alive today so we could discuss it further. (she was polish). i would love to have a movie made of this, only i don't think they could capture the magnitude of the novel nor find a fitting leading lady to play steph."
2,Good for the price...,"Good camera for the price. Major drawback is the lack of an optical zoom. The concept of a digital zoom is worthless and doesn't really provide any advantages I can think of. Of note, this camera also chews up batteries so I would recommend rechargeables."

1,"If you are pretentious douche bag, this is the book for you",We had to read this for a class of mine and I have never been so bored in my entire life. The authors are dull and ostentatious and the text is so abstract it seems like a joke. this is a book that should be used as an example of how not to write books.
4,CELLSUIT NOKIA 5100/6100 SERIES BLUE,"As everyone has stated, it is very very tight on the phone and difficult to align the holes with the buttons. So be sure to align the holes up with the buttons BEFORE your struggle to get it on because it's nearly impossible to remove without ripping the seams. Other than that, I like it. Thanks!"
3,"Great case, but not for 6162","Amazon lists this case as compatible with the Nokia 6162 phone, which has a flip keyboard cover. This case is not for a flip phone, as it has no way of accomodating the flip cover.Otherwise, it is exactly what I'm looking for, which was a neoprene case with a swivel belt clip..."
2,has scratched my phone,"I got this case to prevent my Nokia 5165 from getting scratched, but because it fits so tightly, the stitching around the plastic of the case actually scratched up my phone screen when I removed the phone. A shoddy product."
2,A Wasted Opportunity,"This episode had so much potential. The shuttle crew members do not act like Starfleet personnel. Why is it that people are always mean to Spock when he is in command? Also, why did they send a shuttlecraft to investigate Murasaki 312? I would rather have a Constitution-class starship investigate something rather than a shuttlecraft. That dude on the bridge was pretty annoying too."
3,Calvin Harris - I Created Disco,"You can't blame Calvin Harris for wanting to have a good time, and with I CREATED DISCO, he has his disco and eats it too. It's silly fun -- the funk bass and simple breaks of ""Merrymaking At My Place"" exemplify this or the slow groove of ""Neon Rocks"" -- but that's not to say that it's not catchy. And for the boast of creating disco, I'd say 80s electro would be more appropriate. ""The Girls,"" an ode to the fairer sex, is doused in electro like it's cheap cologne, while ""Acceptable in the 80s"" is an ode to a whole decade. You could argue that the tracks are pretty much the same -- and they are -- but this is a drawback. But a fun drawback! Harris' disaffected lyrics seem pitch-perfect to echo the 80s ennui, even as the kick drum goes into a dancefloor frenzy on ""Disco Heat."" When Harris slows it down for ""Love Souvenir,"" you have to admire the romance and the sleazy existing on the same plane. And the final track, ""Electro Man,"" is just a blast of fun. Hey, why not?"
2,EDITED!!,"AGAIN!What is with these companies?We buy a series to get the ORIGINAL UNEDITED VERSIONS, not some chopped up syndicated version.This package is NOT THE COMPLETE SERIES!Many of the funniest scenes in various episodes are missing!BEWARE!"
5,Great!,"What can I say, I love Taxi. Therefore, a box set gets 5 stars. One note, my father and I both noticed that there were missing episodes? I can't remember off the top of my head which ones, but I'm wondering if we are just crazy or if anyone else had noticed this."
5,the 70 classic hit show,"Taxi: The Complete SeriesThe 70's showed men and women working together in all situations, this show takes you to almost all possibilites of friends and workers in the all time love hate relationships no longer allowed in the workplace. These were simpler times and Taxi has it all.Judd Hirsch. Danny Devito. Tony Danza. Christopher Lloyd."
3,Not as pictured...,"Great series, but buyer beware...Not as pictured...received some in cardboard boxes and others in small plastic cases....this also happened to me when I ordered ""Frasier."" Kind of misleading."
4,Taxi box set,"My only problem so far is there are 5-6 DVD's & I have to play them in order starting with the first DVD. If someone has an answer to fix this problem, I would greatly Appreciated"
1,Not very funny,"I'm not American and I've never been much interested in American sitcoms. I bought this set only because I've become a big fan of Andy Kaufman on YouTube. Now that I've seen some episodes, I understand why Andy himself despised Taxi. For me, it's just full of cliché jokes. There's no real story nor wit. I personally don't see why some people appreciate such an unfunny comedy. The actors themselves must have been bored if they had any sense of humor."
1,cute but doesn't work,"I can't never say it's thermo mug.It spills either. If you want a container, you can buy it, but I don't recommend it any way."
3,Not worth it!,"I am giving this 3 stars only because the audio CD at least was Radiohead entirely. The DVD is boring and you will not see anything new about Radiohead. There are a few very short interviews with the actual band on the DVD but it's mostly other people discussing the band. And they don't even use Radiohead music on the DVD. The CD is ok. A few different interviews with the members of the band. But if you are a big Radiohead fan, then you won't want to bother with this. There is nothing new or informative."
3,"Thanks DC ""Ohio Make-up Artist""","That review was really helpful. For the past couple of weeks I have been debating back and forth about whether or not I should take the $2,000 basic make-up class or just buy a book and teach myself. Your review helped with my decision. I'm going to buy the book. Hopefully I will be equally as pleased as you are.BTW, I had to rate the item in order to write the review. Please disregard it. I'll be back with the real rating once I actually read the book. LOL."
1,Never Thought I had Such a Big Head,"The lanyard is so small, that I had a difficult time getting my head through it. I have never been told I have a big head. I would like my flash drive reaching my chest and not on my neck."
1,Never received,This item was never received. The company did not ever contact me. I give it no stars.....Just couldn't remove one.
2,For serious fans only,"As a fan of the Furs, having seen them several times, I am glad I bought this live CD...BUT(there's always a but,)it's not the best sound quality. The instruments come through a little muddy, which was probably how it sounded to the audience. Richard Butler's voice sounded a bit haggard. Normally a rough voice, it was almost unlistenable on a few cuts, and the way the CD was mastered, his vocals (for better or worse) come through loud and clear over the instruments. I bought this CD because it was priced right, and if I paid more, I would have regretted buying it. If you are a big fan of the Furs, and you like the price, get it. There are some good cuts, and I'm not sorry I have it in my collection."
1,"The Lyrics are Correct, Music is There, Voice is Shot","With great excitement, I unwrapped the CD and skipped down the list to play Heaven...only to be, er...shocked. David Butlers voice is fine until he tries to hold a note. The word ""heaven"" as it comes out of his mouth sounds like he is trying to move a large boulder in his back yard (or perhaps a small stone from his kidney). Having lost my complete music selection twice to theft/stupidity, the P-Furs somehow never made it back onto my ""music-to-replace"" list. Finding this new release with their greatest hits seemed like a quick fix for getting all the good tunes (you know...Heaven, Pretty in Pink, Love my Way...) on one album. Live, extended versions....even better. What I did not realize was that these recordings were made in 2001. If you are Psychedelic furs fan with nostalgia on your mind when looking at replacing your cassettes of old, plunk down your hard earned money on the original releases. If this album was stolen, I wouldn't replace it."
1,Only one good song (but it's a real good one),"I had never heard of Chris Isaak. I bought this album after hearing the haunting and unforgettable ""Can't do a Thing to Stop Me"" on the radio. This song was a total anomaly, and the rest of the album might as well be from another performer. The other songs are like country western, and I would rather listen to cats screeching than that. Maybe it's good if you like that kind of music. If you don't, however, consider that you're paying album prices for a single. It sure is a good single, though."
4,How to Follow Wicked Game,"First, write a song which kinda puts you in the mindset of ""Wicked Game,"" like ""Can't Do A Thing (To Stop Me)."" Then, put this complete piece of fluff on a regular album, which also has plenty of good songs on it. This album broke some new ground for Chris; a bit more spohisticated than the moody moping and borderline stalking we had grown to love. Really good tunes with a new dimension, e.g. ""San Francisco Days,"" ""Beautiful Homes."" ""Two Hearts,"" ""Lonely With A Broken Heart,"" and a killer cover at the end."
5,Chris Isaak-Yes Yes,This CD is Totally Great! and I could listen to it over and over-- and I do. You will not be disappointed by anything he has done. Please check him out.
4,HIS BEST,"Yes there's a sameness to Chris' outings, but the guy is so sincere, nice and handsome that I'd feel like a thug quibbling with the issue. This CD defines a certain consciousness, a very Californian consciousness, and all of the songs are well-crafted and memorable, as is Chris' version of the old ""Solitary Man"", and he makes it sound more sexy and aching than ever (Neil Diamond, pardon my French, was always a little on the greasy side). It's the premiere 'single' on this offering that blazes, however; ""Can't Do a Thing to Stop Me"" is a retro gem that begs playing after playing, and Chris' haunting falsetto never fails to give me chills."
4,Music for your heart!,"A wonderful collection of tunes....I defy any true loving couple to listen to ""Two Hearts"" without feeling their hearts soar...So many great songs, so much dancing and hand-holding to do! We loved it!"
4,Another Terrific Album,"If you are trying to get away from the thematic approach that Chris Isaak seems to take in ""Forever Blue"" and ""Baja Sessions"", then this album is for you. This album has no real common theme; but that is certainly not a bad thing. Outside of the ill-tempered and somewhat annoying ""Round and Round"", this album is full of pretty tunes, the best of the best being, the Title Track, ""Can't Do a Thing(to stop me)"", ""Except the New Girl"", and ""Waiting"". Isaak's cover of Neil Diamond's ""Solitary Man"" is a gorgeous one, and rounds out a near-perfect Chris Isaak experience."
1,sub-prime service,"The service is not good at all. They sent me the wrong DVD, and never offered to sent a correct one."
4,Great for the use of it,"Well a friend of mines, saw a toy at a story (Used)This is about five or seven year old toy. But when she put it into the toy. It worked. Didn't even charged the battery. Just making sure the problem was the battery. So her grandsons are really enjoying something special. And the price beat out Wal-Mart by more than $25.00. Great Job Amazon."
2,Cables To Go 4 port KVM fares poorly,"The Cables To Go 4 port USB PS@ unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on. But I have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the KVM is not switched to that device. The video card goes into some blacked out video mode. The pc has to be shutdown. The box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error. The box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc. You must bo the port and watch the reboot. Then card is OK until next reboot unattended. Frustrating. The keyboard and mouse are OK. But with wireless keyboard/mouse combo, the box can not be on auto scan mode. Too many drawbacks."
2,Unsatisfactory VGA Image,"I bought the Cables To Go USB KBM Switch to replace a D-Link KVM that had failed. This Port Authority KVM has neat features (auto-switching, switchable USB hub, auto-conversion of USB on all connected PCs to work with PS2 keyboard and mouse), but it delivers a poor image on my VGA monitor. My HP f2105 plasma display's image is fuzzy and has ghost images.I've not yet determined whether the poor image results from the KVM switch, itself or from the KVM-to-PC cables that accompanied the unit.Either way, I wouldn't purchase this product again."
2,Stopped working after 2 years,"I used this KVM for switching a Keyboard, mouse and USB printer between 2 Intel Macs and a PC for the first year, and then just between the 2 macs the 2nd year. I never used it for video switching. It was sometimes problematic, and had to be reset - but worked OK for 2 years. Then it just stopped switching, and resetting it did not fix the problem."
5,"At last, Common Sense!","This book was wonderful, and what makes it even better is that the people who will be offended by the book are precisely the ones whose existence offends me.Obsessive-Compulsive Compassion Disorder. Heh Heh Heh.What a great book! If you have an hour, read it!"
3,What's the rest of the story?,"Well written essay accurately assessing certain aspects of the problems facing society and their source. Precious little provided by the author to address solutions. The closest he gets is the ""chapter"" call ""48 Minutes."""
5,Ahh...Liberals,"When liberals are confronted with the truth and facts, they resort to name-calling. That statement is has been proven very true in the reviews I've read about this book. The book itself is an in-your-face, hard-hitting speech that would truly prepare college graduates for the real world. I only wish some people wouldn't slam a book without actually reading it."
4,A CLASSIC ALBUM,GREAT MUSIC EVEN IF YOU AREN'T GAY ... WHICH I AM NOT ... WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN ONE OF THE CLASSIC 80s BANDS ...
4,POP! - 20 Hits ~ Erasure,"I love the way Vince Clark uses synth sounds and the beat and are great. The lyrics are not all that great though and Andy Bell seems happy to sing about nothing important or to write inane lyrics that just do not make sense. There is something annoying about Bells vocals and he sounds like he is trying way to hard and it just comes out as forced and not natural. I like the fact that one can see what equipment Vince Clarke uses to make his music. The problem that I have with the lyrics is that they are all to melodramatic and filled with absolutely nothing and they could just about be talking about the weather and the song would sound as well. However, I still give in 4 stars and that is because Clarke saves these inane lyrics with awesome synth programming and execution. Now if he had only pick a better lyricist or just written the lyrics like he did for Depeche Mode then the songs would not sound as campy and right down stupid."
3,Nice Collection If You Don't Already Have The Songs,If you're an Erasure fan there is no reason to get this album because you probably already ahve all these songs someplace else. The songs are all singles with no new songs. Not even a readio version amongst the bunch. If you're just a fan of the singles and never bought the albums this is for you.
4,Good if you like the older stuff,I like Erasure and this cd definitely has 20 hits. I prefer Erasure's newer cds: Cowboy and Loveboat.
3,erasure for dummies,"a good intro to the group, but as any true Erasure fan already knows, it is definitely not a ""best of.."" album"
2,Please send them to Eurovision,"We actually liked Erasure during the 1980's. Their albums, which constantly spewed forth singles. Vince Clarke, who had formed three bands. Or were they four? Andy Bell, who tried to sound like Alison Moyet, and who was obviously gay. Did I mention the constant single releases?In reality, Erasure was crap. What on earth were we thinking?Yazoo were innovative. Even the Assembly was innovative. But Erasure? They sound like some wayward British entry to the Eurovision Song Contest! Indeed, I'm surprised they never represented ""the United Kingdom"". I'm sure they could have won it, forcing the BBC to organize the contest somewhere in Brighton.No, we are not amused..."
4,An Interesting Album,"Erasure has their own distinct style. You have to hear them to know what I'm talking about. They're REALLY heavy on the synth-pop sound and high-pitch vocals, so this album title is appropriately named.Pop is usually highly upbeat, and many songs in this album are, like Stop! and Chains of Love. But what really pulls this album together are the darker songs that aren't quite so upbeat like Ship of Fools and The Circus, which are still heavy on the synth, but not so much the pop.This album is quite harmonic, and you can find a track to listen to no matter what mood you're in. I got more out of it than I bargained for."
4,simply the best of erasure,"While missing a few of my personal favorites, this CD is the one to own if you can only own one Erasure CD."
5,Tastes Like Chicken,"If you are a fan of bands like the Pet Shop Boys, New Order or Electronic then you will enjoy Erasure's Pop 20. The first five songs are among my favorites, but I am especially partial to track 16 Chorus. My friend James thinks this CD is essential for making out with his girlfriends. Try for yourself, but not by yourself."
3,80's Dance Euro....Erasure is the definition!,"Fun, catchy, and dancable...describes Erasure's music. This is a true greatest hits CD. Give it a try you might like Erasure."
4,"Good, Not the Greatest.","This is an interesting CD. I purchased it cheap and found it to be well worth the price however it does not hold my interest that long. The songs suffer in the long run from being similar to each other(at least most of them). There are some really great tunes, my favorites being Ship of Fools and Stop(it really is catchy) the other songs are great too.Overall: A good listen but I prefer the Best of New Order and the Best Shop Boys Discography for their better lyrics and variety in style(particularily on the New Order CD) Definitely check out Erasure but if you want better music check out the above CD's"
1,NOT New,"This item is NOT new. It was packed in a dirty slip on plastic cover that was STAPLED tocardboard, with a rusty staple, and not a sealed clam box. There is a label pasted on the back with with thefollowing number X0000VDA3T, and the word ""NEW"" I ordered DTQ450, NOT DTQ450X.I was only refunded 11.16, but I paid 16.21.This is unacceptable.Gail Maria"
1,quick & readable,"Everything about the ProAccurate thermometer is great to use & in the face of it...well, its just so readable. Love it..."
1,probably not for convection roasting,"The whole apparatus melted within 10 minutes. It perhaps was the way I used it, as I put it into 450 degree convection oven on 'roast'. But my understanding was that it was rated for up to 450 degrees, no exceptions. Went to the Publix and got an old timey clock hands type thermometer, which works fine for our needs."
3,Not What I Wanted,"When the thermometer arrived I saw on the packaging ""Perfect for Thin cuts of meat, fish or poultry."" I was looking for something I could use with the Thanksgiving turkey, so decided to return it. I can't rate it since I didn't use it, but I thought people should have this information. I couldn't find it anywhere on the Amazon site."
2,Paint in the food?,"I used this item for two years and now the red paint on the probe tip is peeling off. Did it get into our food? Hard to say. Otherwise it worked well, no problem with battery life. It is top heavy, so the face is always turning downward and that makes it a bit awkward to read. But if not for the paint issue I'd give it 4 stars. Because of the paint issue, I tossed it."
1,Won't calibrate,"I just received this thermometer and tried to calibrate it, and it won't calibrate. The instructions say that in order to avoid accidental calibration, it will only calibrate when it reads between 30-34F. When I put it in ice water to calibrate, it reads ~38F, so it won't calibrate to 32F. I let the ice water sit for a while and all that, no luck still."
4,Its been working great for me,I have had this for about a year and has been working great it is my primary thermometer (I have 2) because of its portablity I can take it to the BBQ easy enough. I use it about 3-4 times a week.
1,worked fine two times only,"I was really happy with this thermometer. I used it once to make yogurt and once to cook a roast. In neither case did it get dropped, immersed in water or left in the oven. In no way did I mishandle it. And yet, third time was not the charm. It just didn't work anymore. The display still worked but no numbers would appear, not after removing and replacing the battery, nor after trying to recalibrate."
4,Not for deep frying,"It seems like a nice little thermometer. It's rated to 450 degrees and I bought it for use with deep frying. The stem is about 5 inches long. It has no clip to hold it on a pot. The readout end is partly plastic. Don't buy this thermometer for deep frying. You can use it for a second opinion of the actual temperature, but this is not a high temp workhorse. I like that it can be calibrated for accuracy. The numbers on the readout are about 1 centimeter (0.4 inches) tall and reasonably easy to see without reading glasses - but a back light would help."
2,Short life span,"This worked great for about four months and then it started getting very erratic readings even just turning it on. The first time it started acting weird is when I went to test a piece of pork and it said it had an internal temperature of 230 degrees! Then without using it and just turning it on, it gave me a reading of minus 3 degrees. I'm very disappointed in this thermometer."
4,Excellent for the price,"This thermometer does its job, not without problems but certainly at a level that's tremendous relative to its cost.Its temperature assessment is quick and accurate. That is the fundamental thing a thermometer is supposed to do, and this one does it well. The display is large and easy to read. I have neither over- nor undercooked a single piece of meat since I purchased the it, which is as strong an endorsement as anyone should need.My gripes are all shape related: the shape of the head and size/placement of the buttons. As a man with fairly large hands, the smooth, curved rear of the thermometer head is not easy to grip, especially if it is damp from oil spatters or steam, and the tiny buttons aren't easy to press. Some kind of grippy surface on the back and larger, better spaced buttons would get it a perfect score.Overall, I'm satisfied that I got a good value for the price."
2,Measured too high a temperature,I received this as a gift and within one year the temperature shown was always too high. My medium rare steak would be raw to rare!
1,Broke after one use,"The pocket holder did not seem to fit the stem of the thermometer. It required much too force to get it in the holder and then would not come out. After progressive pulling, the head came off the stem, ripping the wires."
1,"Arrived DOA, retuning to Amazon","Unit looks nice, but apparently mine has a short. Arrived dead, changed out the battery tried it. Still didn't work. Removed new battery and found that it was very hot."
5,it's an inexpensive thermometor for heavens sakes,"I bought it because of Cooks Illustrated recommendation and the price. It feels a bit fragile, but it works fine. This things is amazing because it does exactly what is designed to do, tell you the temperature of things, amazing... It's great that you can (and should) calibrate it. If you don't want to spend much, add this to your shopping cart and then check out. Your feelings will not be hurt at all..."
5,Barbequeing made better.,"I saw this thermometer on a cooking show and wanted to try it on thebarbeque, it turned out to be great. No over or under cooking and veryeasy to use. I would recommend this item to everyone, indoor or out."
1,not satisfied,The thermometer that I received does not look like the picture at all. What I received is hard to read and slim like a pen or pencil.
3,it is okay,I'm not seeing how it is much different than the $8 thermometer that I bought in the hardware store. Maybe I'm not using it correctly. I'll keep trying.
4,Needs better calibration,"This take temperatures very quickly and the narrow probe pierces food very easily.I realize for the price that you can't have everything. One really frustrating thing about this is that its calibration function will only work if you are within a few degrees of the target temperature. If your thermometer is out of calibration more than those few degrees, you can't calibrate. I know they do this to keep people from accidentally calibrating but they need to open that range up a lot more. My thermometer's calibration was outside the range and there's really no way for me to correct it. I only use mine for cooking, though, so a few degrees off isn't a big deal."
5,ProAccurate Thermometer,Got this gift for a cook. We used it the first time to cook on new years day and the meat came out perfect.
3,Messed up after one year,"The calibriation on mine went haywire. I tried recalibrating in an ice bath per the instructions with no luck. I then replaced the battery and tried again and it is still messed up. Its sitting in an ice bath right now but says the temp is 52 deg F.BTW, the calibration function doesn't seem to do anything unless you do it with ambient temps between 23-41 deg F, meaning you need to stick the whole thing in the freezer to try to recalibrate it.When it worked it worked fine. Now that its screwed up it is useless. Good news is that it has a 5 year warranty, so I guess I'll be trying to contact CDN about fixing it.UPDATE: I mailed in the bad one to CDN and they sent me a new one. So far it works as advertised."
3,Good enough,"In order to use it effectively, make sure you do not submerge the entire tip.It is annoying and I don't know why it does this, it turns off automatically without giving you the temperature."
5,"Great Product, very pleased!",Quality product that I have been using and enjoying thoroughly at least a few times a week since I bought it 6 months ago. Considering getting a second one.
3,Not truly instant read,"I bought this to have an instant-read thermometer. This measures the temperature, but it often takes 10 seconds or more, which defeats the point of an instant-read thermometer."
1,it broke when we took it out of the box,"We were excited about this product , and had read many positive reviews about its performance. But we never got a chance to see if it worked because when we took it out of the box to check it out, we put it into its pocket clip cover,and when we tried to take it back out, the head came off, exposing the wires, and all. It just broke into 2 pieces! I am returning it, and unable to decide if I want to replace it with the same thing, or try something totally different. What a hassle!"
1,Waste of money!,"Quit working after one use. Was not impressed with it while it did work.Don't waste your money. If you want a good instant read digital thermometer... Buy a Thermapen. More money, and worth it."
3,Waterproof?,Indicates temperature very fast I loved that...but waterproof? Apparently not! It quit working after washing one time by hand. I'll order another one and be very gentle when cleaning it.CDN ProAccurate Quick-Read DTQ450X Thermometer
5,Fabulous Thermometer!,This thermometer has saved many chicken dinners from being ruined. It works for baked goods as well. I can't live without it!
4,Almost a great book,"Loved the action - wish the Chis would show up more - they're tough enough to fight the mysterious foes from the unknown regions so let them kick some YV butt! Jaina was great as a schizoid. Have to say though, that the hole left by you-know-who's death is annoying - just after YKW had bonded with another Jedi like Qui Gon and Tahl - guess it's just the way it goes in the Expanded Universe. Yeah, decent enough and short enough to stay with."
4,Best of newer Star Wars' novels,Looking forward to next read by Cunningham. Jaina Solo presents a real and powerful female hero struggling to keep her soul in tact.Also enjoyed time-travel novel Damsel in rough by Tempesta. [Better] than expected.
1,reader,"Unfortunately, this book doesn't tell the story we've all waited for. It is like taking a journey down a pipeline with blinders on. You get to through the story, but there is not much substance. You are left to wonder why, how, where, where did the characters get where they are, where they've gotten their ideas, WHY they are doing what they are doing, sometimes you wonder WHAT they are doing! The book leaves out most of the main SW characters, and deals badly with Jania. It was a disappointment"
2,Disappointing writing style,"As an avid fan of the NJO series, I would have to agree with other reviews that this was a dissappointing installment. I found that I had to reread several passages to figure out what was happening. I felt the writing was not as strong as some of the other books in the series. However, I must admit that I was caught up in the suspense and anxiety of whether or not Jaina would start to turn things around. I would also agree that this book could have been stronger with more allusions to Jacen's fate and to Luke and Mara's efforts. Here's to a better installment next time."
1,the worst one yet,"Some of the previous NJO books have been rather boring and I was getting to the point when I didn't really care when the next book came out and then I read Star by Star and I really enjoyed it. So my expectations for Dark Journey were rather high. I read the book in a day but that was just to find out if they mentioned anything about Jacen. I have never really like Jaina so a whole book devoted to her was rather boring, although the change in Kyp was nice to see. The writing style was what really got to me, it just didn't draw me. I would recomend that people just get the book from the library and read it because it doesn't really further the story, in fact I could have missed this one and would not have very many problems following the story in the next book. I hope the next one is better."
2,Sheesh,"I have read most of the books in the star wars universe (there's always new ones it seems!!!) and this booked ranked at near the top of my ""dissapointment"" list. I thought this was the weakest NJO book to date after a strong showing in Star by Star. This book is what I would call an afterthought book. Jaina's ""descent"" into the dark side was almost laughable in the context of one book and the deeper heartwrenching struggles that Kyp and Luke went through is like comparing mountains to Jaina's molehills. It would have been nice to have this story play out over several books instead of one 300 page book. It felt cheap.It was nice to see Kyp be featured ,and it seems they may try to develop him more than just the ""jedi rogue"" role.This book was a short story that really didn't seem to advance the overall plot of the NJO universe."
2,Very disappointing,"I felt compelled to share my disappointment in this book. Normally, I am writing about how good they are.This book was a big letdown after Star by Star. It had a very start and stop feel to it and barely even scratched the surface of Jaina looking towards the Dark Side. More just like Jaina having a really bad day.I am also very disappointed in Anakin's funeral. It was treated like an afterthought and was very poorly written. You would think that Luke, his uncle, and the head of the Jedi would have had something major to say. It really seemed like this author barely understood the characters. Anakin was such a great character and it was just glossed over.I really hope the next book is better, the fans deserve much better than this one."
3,I wonder if any of the NJO authors have ever met a teenager?,"Because, with a few exceptions, there is now way a 17 year old will be a witty, urbane, master martial artist, master technician, master tactician, master of an all-powerful force; a master pilot--Lt. Colonel, no doubt; and, the only hot girl in the Universe, that every man wants.Bah.What is with these authors? I have no problem with powerful, deadly women--but this is too much. Even if I could believe a kid like Jaina was capable of all that, I still wouldn't like her. She is constantly written as a spoiled rotten brat. She's essentially a slightly less talkative version of Mara.God, I'm getting angry just remembering this book!"
2,This was the worst of the series.,"I really didn't like this book. So what that Jaina goes to the darkside if for at least a while, and then comes back? Where's the real action? Come on...and I told this to others...I will no longer read any star wars fiction if it has all three Solo children dead."
1,The worst Star wars novel i read in years,I found the charcters not believeable it ends half way into it people cryed when on of the main charcters died i like to qoute a line from Star Trek Get a life people than more life than Star wars. it is just a Novel.Star Trek Rulessssssssssssssssssssss.
4,CATION!! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!,Strange stuff happens when Jacen Solo isn't around to keep a lid on things.Jaina turns to the dark side;Tennel Ka becomes a queen;The Cheif of State tries to personally go up against the Yuuzhan Vong;and Kyp decides to reastablish the Jedi Council.Needless to say Dark Journey is one interesting book.
4,"A Response to ""a reader"" from Pueblo, Co","I agree that its a good thing Elaine Cunningham has only written one book in our favorite universe, but{and its a very important 'but'}I think she could do better if she really tried.I thin you were a little harsh and I'm saying that quite honestly.Now then, Dark Journey was an interesting depiction of the Star Wars universe. I had a great time reading it but, as a few readers have pointed out, she made errors at many turns. One of the biggest was not using the twin aspect to continue Jacen's story in SYNC with his sister. I would like to know what caused the ""surge in the Force"" that everyone seems to think was Jacen's 'life Force!"
3,ok,i thought this book was ok but why ... did they have anikin die and why didt they tell us any thing about jacen or verge(i think she was the jedi knight obi wan and anikin were looking for in rouge planet).
2,Who is left?,Star war books used to have an ending or at least a semi-ending if a two book series. Tha last books 9 and 10 have no endings and it seems the authors are on a kick to kill off all the main characters. It would be good to have at least some good endings left at the conclusion of the books.
3,"The journey may be dark, but it's the same old one.","Star by star, the last book in the New Jedi Order series, reached a climax by killing off Anakin and let the Vongs conquer the repblican capital. One would hope to see some new lights or new direction in the follow up, unfortunately, this didn't happen in Dark Journey. Elaine Cunningham may be a good writer but she doesn't have the firm understanding of the starwar history or the imagination needed to carry on the legacy. Instead, many old friends/foes are brought out again and the story rovolves on the same old journey. There is nothing new added to the New Jedi Series, it has became stagnent, just like many of the Jedis in the book. It used to be fun to read the starwar books and see the Jedi face the chanlleges and beat the odds; now I actually wish some of the Jedis turn to the darkside just to add some energy to the whole book."
3,ok,i thought this book was a ok one but why did anikin solo have to die and why didt they tells us what happened to jacen and verege(i think verege was the jedi knight obiwan and anikin were sent to find in rouge planet
3,Disappointing,"This story orients more about political positioning in the Hapes Cluster than the war against the Yuuzhan Vong. There is no real problem with this story line; my problem is that this is little more than an extended short story than a full Star Wars novel! In fact, the story only takes up 65% of the book with the remaining 35% previews(advertisements?) for other Star Wars stories.Please, if you are going to market a story as a full novel, make it a novel!"
1,NJO: Dark Journey,"I have read all of the published NJO novels and Dark Journey is the worst. A character's wants create the action from which a well-written story line flows. Star by Star establishes why Jaina Solo turns to the dark side of the Force. Dark Journey does not add anything new. There is no answer to this pivotal question in the story: As a Dark Jedi, what does Jaina do, say, or decide that makes a bad situation for the New Republic better or worse? Instead, Jaina spends most of the novel snapping at other characters and working upon the Trickster. Furthermore, the story line does not explain how or why she reaches her turning point--the return to the light side of the Force. The story lacks action, character development, and a climax."
2,Whats going on?,"I don't understand the direction this series is going. First they kill Chewy, and then Anakin who was the biggest character. Now this book deals with Jania leaning to the dark side. Thats it, for 301 pages all it's about is Jania's struggle with the dark side. It's nice to see Kyp do some good for a change but we will see if that lasts. I really expected more form this one. One last note. I thought a jedi knight was suppose to dissapeer when they died? They did'nt even get that right. Save your money and lets hope the next one is a little better."
1,Was this really an NJO book?,"Don't get me started on how horrible this book was. I was appalled that this could even carry the title ""New Jedi Order."" This is the worst book in the entire New Jedi Order series. It was all about Jaina and only about Jaina. There was almost no noticable plot and I think Jaina is a little old for being such a child. You think Anakin and Jacen are dead, that's no reason to regress to a child! This writer captured grief all wrong for starters.Secondly, a book just about Jaina doesn't appeal to EVERYONE. The general idea is to make a book as appealing to all audiences as possible and Cunningham failed miserably.The book is not fit to follow Star by Star and would be better off as a very long side story.The only somewhat notable thing that happened was the discovery of the Yammosk signals and the ability to jam them. Aside from that it was pretty much a garbage book with nothing happening."
