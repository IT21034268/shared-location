2,Works for one or two uses. More of a toy than an emergency light.,Pros: Casts a reasonable amount or light. Good in ablackout for bathroom use or walking around - but not asbright as a flashlight.Cons: Runs through batteries pretty quickly.Bigger issue is that after second or third use (on all three)the bulb burns out. Worse is that replacement bulbs are not tobe found anywhere.For slightly more money there are far better options available.
3,Two of Three Worked,"You get what you pay for. These little lanterns are great, even if fragile. Given the price, I expected problems from the outset. My expectations were met: Two worked great; one didn't work at all. I think that is okay, all in all. I won't return them, because it wouldn't be worth the hassle, and I'm satisfied with two working units for the price. I'd buy it again."
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased this (Set of 3) emergency lanterns to end up with only one that worked; they are cheap encough and I guess you only ""get what you pay for"" it's better to by one good lantern for more money than to waste money on ones that don't work!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"Some of the lamps did not work, some of the lamps were missing bulbs, and some worked for 1 day anbd then stopped. A huge waste of my money. I did not get in contact with anyone when I tried."
4,Buy bulk: You need it and save money too,"For a little more than twice what most places charge for a seven inch piece of Paradox release rope, you can have a hundred feet. For my new bow, I blew the first loop when The end I was melting actually melted part of the loop--I would have to buy another piece right there. As it turned out, I also replaced the line on my drop down rest--a couple of feet used the first time out. Yeah--a hundred feet of the stuff is the sensible way to buy Paradox. I like the dispenser too--a small hole in the side feeds out the rope and allows you to throw it into your archery tackle box, a drawer, or just set it on the counter without worrying about it coming all unwound and tangled."
5,masterminds,the cd is great it falls so much in line with the movie. they couldn't have picked a beter selection of songs for this movie. great job.
3,I loved it!,"I thought it was a great cd! I saw the movie and loved the music so i thought I would check out if there was a sound-track... I just totally loved all the music, and i think you should definetly check it out if your into the rock scene. AND VINCENT KARTHEISER IS TOTALLY A HOTTIE!"
5,This CD kicks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love every single song on this CD. Ive been looking for it for about a year but i finally found it here!!!!!!! The movie kicks and so does the soundtrack. I think it is good because every single song is great!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Quick, fun, read. McBain is a master!","I love these short novels, they cut to the chase. You can read them in a day, and they pack such a punch. You don't have to read a book for days for gratification and pay-off. There's so much going on between these 200 pages. This is probably my third or fourth read in the 87 Pct. series, and given a cheap kindle deal on this, I'll read the rest of the series hopefully in order."
2,drive-in drivel,"The buddy-pairing of Judge Reinhold and Willem Dafoe is a curious one. Reinhold somehow built a career on Billy from Beverly Hills Cop and a guest spot as the ""close talker"" on Seinfeld, while Dafoe earned well-deserved fame from films such as Last Temptation of Christ and Platoon, though his best work may actually be 2002's Auto Focus. You could say that pairing them together is movie magic, but you would be wrong.In fact, the movie is a complete bomb. Lead female Kaaren Lee can't act her way out of a wet paper bag, there's no real laughs nor any credible drama, and no one is helped by the piss-poor direction from first-timer John Mark Robinson. This movie blows chunks of chicken-fried steak. If you really want a so-bad-it's-almost-not-so-bad flick about losers driving cars, check outSpeed Lovers.Rating:One star for being shot on location (Arizona's Route 66), the other for Willem actually singing on stage. That's a very generous 2-star rating, folks."
5,Arrived in excellent condition,"This is a review of the product, not the movie itself. The product arrived new and factory sealed as advertised. I haven't watched the movie yet. I started to watch this on TV but it was getting late and I had to go to bed. It was interesting enough that I decided to buy the movie."
2,This book needs an editor,"I was required to read this book for a technical writing class. I was amazed that a book that boasts it can teach technical documentation could have so many glaring errors in grammar and spelling. (Maybe that's why so many people don't read manuals.)While the book does well as a step-by-step approach, most of the information is in other books. I would not recommend this book."
4,Great in-depth book for the new Tech Writer,I got this book through an online cetification class for writing user manuals and reference guides. I never would have found this book had it not been for that class. This book is great in that it takes you through the 7 steps of documentation. I'd recommend this book for those getting started in the technical writing field and those who are senior members. The author also chunks the information in a way that is easily understandable. Great book!
5,A Must-Have for Technical Writers!,"I had taken a course in Technical Communication for which this book was a recommended-read. After going through the chapters, I must say that this is an excellent guide for anyone who documents software.The book takes a task-oriented approach and lists some great pointers. It gives you a step-by-step process for analyzing users, learning a software program, and writing the documentation; teaches you the basics of page and screen design, and even helps you understand the software users better.This is the only *readable*(cover-to-cover) technical writing book that I have come across. Definitely a great buy!"
2,"Probably useful, but...","Given the price I paid for the book, I expected something better than a Docutech print-out of hard copy. The least they could have done was run the electronic files through the Docutech (a high-end copier) so that the screen captures showed up a little better than fuzzy.The other problem I had was the lack of anything approaching a professional touch in the layout and design of the book. The person or persons who laid out the book did a poor to mediocre job of it at best. Given the subject matter -- writing software documentation -- I would have expected the author and publisher to put even *some* effort into creating a useful visual language. As it is, there may well be useful, important information in the text, but the design of the book is so poor, I'll be damned if I can track it down."
2,A difficult book to use,"I have to use this book in a technical writing course and I find it difficult to use and read, especially if you are new to the field.The formatting and layout of the book makes it easy to lose track of which section you are in (using a numbering system to identify sections would be helpful) and it needs more white space. The author tends to be verbose at times and this also helps to ""lose"" the reader.A short answer or multiple choice question section would be useful to help in review of material covered in a chapter.The index seems somewhat sparse and a ""master"" glossary at the end would be useful."
5,Documentation Made Easy,Book gives a great step-by-step guide on how to prepare documentation for the computer industry.
3,Short read for kids,"This book gives some basic information about vampires and werewolves and ponders over the fact if they could truly exist. You get to read about old legends, some of which are pretty gruesome, but interesting. The book also handles some possible scientific causes of vampirism and lycanthropy, like rabies or brain poisoning. The chapter isn't very long, but it is still an informative read.Overall, the book has been put together nicely, but it is a very short read for kids. It is stated that this book is targeted for children from 9 to 12 years, but I'm pretty sure that kids of those ages are usually quite fluent readers. (We are living the times of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, after all!) With 32 pages, large text and pictures, the book doesn't take a lot of time to read. Also, the pages have some pictures on them, but only a few actually show you vampires or werewolves."
2,Boring,"The story seemed trite, nothing compeling about it. Bogart was good, as usual, but no great plot or deep thoughts."
3,Old style Hollywood crime thriller,"One of the old films that when we start watching it, we know how it will turn out-making it sad and a bit predictable, in a funny way. Still, I was glad to see it finally out on dvd, ready for a re-viewing out of the old UHF channels from which it came.Good solid, characters, old fashioned cars and shoot outs---it's a pretty fun movie to tank a few beers to. Not a real classic, but worthwhile as an addition to a film buff's library."
3,Thirties style gangster epic and Bogie's big breakthrough.,"This, along with The Maltese Falcon (both 1941 films) propelled Bogart to super stardom. Ironically both roles were turned down by George Raft. Bogart plays, with great sensitivity, Roy Earle--a tough, aging desperado who wants to settle down after one last caper. He is doomed, however, to meet a cruel fate amid the majestic and indifferent mountains of the high sierra. Earle, in his own way, has moments of compassion and basic decency which makes his tragic end all the more touching. Well directed by Raoul Walsh and an important film for Bogart. 3 1/2 stars."
3,Interesting and different!,"I found this book to be a fun read. For anyone who knows about the good old days of music this book is a spectular find. It puts you right into Dublin, feeling the times and showing you the dedication to soul.This book is home to the band of ""The Commitments"". With manager Jimmy, Outspan on guitar and others covering bass, drums, sax, trumpet and vocals they will give you a tase of the new Dublin soul.The only fall back to this book is it happens to be a slow read. Some parts that should have been quick and to the point were very drown out. But, if you enjoy stories of music you'll enjoy this."
1,SOULLESS GINGERS WHO MADE A SOUL BAND?,"So bad, had to read it for FILM class, the book is full of 'he said' 'she said' all in the worst possible cockney accent, so you have to kind of figure out what they are saying, which is a waste of time. The story is just boring. It's like wow you made a crappy soul group? You are a bunch of soulless gingers, how is that even possible."
1,Boooorrrriiinngggg,"*Yawn*Had to read this for an english course, otherwise I never would have gotten past the first paragraph."
4,Just like the movie says,"If you saw the movie, you can picture the characters throughout the dialog. It is written more like a movie script than a narrative. But you get the flavors of the narrative. Music cited is also different from the movie. Ending is different from the movie and may be more realistic."
5,"Brilliant, Brother Rabbitte","This book is enormous inspiration to me as a writer because of the way Roddy Doyle creates charactars through dialog and inner thought. After reading the book, as well as watching the movie, I get the feeling that I just spend a weekend around Dublin with Outspan, Jimmy, Deco and the rest of the ""tossers."" That's the strength of this book the feel of familiarity and the flow of the charactar development. Don't look for plot here, just feel how the book flows and notice how you become entranced with the charactars."
4,A Novel That Reads Like A Play- Seems Natural That It was Made Into A Film,"Roddy Doyle's first novel is very funny. It has a group of great if disparate young characters trying to do something none of them has had any experience with and the resulting tensions that rise between almost seem inevitable. Trying to organize a bunch of Dublin kids and form them into a soul band in the 80s at the height of U2's popularity sounds improbable but the main character a would be agent/Entrepreneur nearly pulls it off. Written in a snappy style almost entirely consists of dialogue this novel has the feel of a play. It is entirely driven by witty Irish street slang laden banter between the characters. I wonder if Doyle wrote this thinking of staging it or of a movie it is so easily transferred. The movie is good, the book is better."
4,Good Alice Cooper Double Feature,"The guy who wrote the liner notes obviously did not have a clue abut his subject matter, the song lyrics should have been inserted instead. However Cooper's attention to diction makes ""Brutal Planet"" and ""Dragontown"" fascinating listening. Both are underrated albums that confront issues or morality. The music rocks."
3,Ravensburger Rush Hour Jigsaw puzzle,"I love the picture on this puzzle. It was difficult to do the outside pieces, so many of them were monocolor, and so many of them fit very nicely into the wrong piece. With the multicolored pieces it is clear from the color fit whether they are in the correct place or not. I am still doing it about 15 minutes per day, enjoy the challenge immensely, and it is a nice break."
4,Fun!,"I took this to the beach with a group of friends and the puzzle did what I was hoping it would - reeled in people and created a group activity. The puzzle was difficult enough to be challenging, but not impossible. It was a good buy!"
5,A hopeful revival,"Well, it looks like Kyou Kara Maoh will live to see another day! According to Anime on DVD, Funimation has picked up the distribution rights, and is going to start releasing where Geneon left off. As for this volume, it's definitely what I would consider the ""calm before the storm"". Though some of the episodes are a bit darker (see episode 65), there is still a decent amount of comedy and humor on this disc. I'm definitely looking forward to rounding out my set!"
1,Beware of DHL Shipping,"We ordered this product on 17 December (used) and it has taken DHL over 2 weeks to deliver. I really can't tell if the product is good or bad...because it has not been delivered yet. If you plan on buying used, be sure to use a seller that does not use DHL."
2,Pictures far superior to text,"Alice McGill, Molly Bannaky (Houghton Mifflin, 1999)The first thing to be said about Molly Bannaky is that the illustrations, by Chris Sontpiet, are some of the finest you will ever see in a kids' book. They make this book worth the price of admission, and your children, if they're into the pretty pictures thing, will probably treasure them long into adulthood.It's too bad the prose doesn't fit the illustrations. Molly Bannaky, the story of the grandmother of scientist Benjamin Banneker, is rushed, uneven, and contains gaps large enough for the author's entire credibility to fall through. I've mentioned kids' innate crap detectors a number of times in my reviews of kids' books; some of the transitions here (do authors really still use the word ""suddenly""?) are bound to set them off.But you've still got the pictures. **"
5,Incredibly fun and addictive,"what a great game! I played it start to finish with my 6 and 9 year old and we're ready to to it again. the graphics are beautiful, the characters and dialogue are really funny and engaging and imaginitive. what a great antidote to the mindless shoot em up clones."
4,Good Cook'in,Easy to follow recipes. Well worth the time and money. Success encourages you to try new and different recipes---you'll have great success with this book.
3,"Sorry, dissapointed","This is a standard, quite small thomas train with a tiny shed he travels under. It is fairly cool, but again, so small and trivial. I wish it was bigger. Way overpriced"
2,Activity Center versions don't have an adventure,"My son enjoys the Magic School Bus series, but he lost interest in this game pretty quickly. He really enjoys games with missions/adventures and this disc does not have one, it is very open-ended, just click around and play mini-games. It is educational, but without a mission, my son just loses interest pretty fast. I am glad I paid like $2 for this from the library bookstore."
4,Love it!,We just got this coffee pot at Costco for $99 and LOVE IT! It takes a little more work getting set up than our old Mr. Coffee pot. You have to clean the grinding components each time for optimal taste - that is why I only gave it 4 stars. But the extra time is worth it. The coffee tastes amazing and it is ready when we wake up in the morning. I haven't experienced any leaking problems like I have heard about.
3,Some bad features,"I also bought this product[...]. It makes good hot coffee but there are a few things I think could be improved upon. The grinding components need to be cleaned each time you use it because moisture from the brewing process goes up into that area and the coffee residue gets wet. The thermal pot is very nice but needs to be turned at an uncomfortable angle when pouring, especially when there is only a small amount of coffee left, and this can be problem for people that are physically challenged.Lastly the grinder is extremely noisy, and doesn't shut off immediatly when the grinding process is complete, which can be a problem if your kitchen is close to your bedroom and you set the auto feature to brew coffee before you get up."
2,coffee4me,"The first few weeks I used this coffee maker I LOVED IT! The coffee was hot and delicious. And then one morning I came downstairs to find coffee all over my counter, down my white cabinets and sitting on my wood floors. I thought it was just fluke and cleaned it up and made a new pot. Then this started happening more and more often. You have to line everything up PERFECTLY! Make sure everything is in properly or you will have an overflow to clean up! I wish this coffee maker were not so tempermental, because it does make a great pot of coffee, but I got so tired of the gamble that I bought a new coffee maker."
1,Junk,"Moisture from brewing gets up into the grinder every time you brew coffee, so it has to be cleaned EVERY TIME! That may not seem like a big deal now, but you WILL quickly get tired of having to do this. I quit using the grinder in this coffee maker and just use my Braun grinder instead.Also, the timer on mine never worked. Once the coffee brews the electronics go into la-la land, and the thing has to be unplugged and replugged back in (basically re-booted) to get any of the buttons to work.Look at how many ""remanufactured"" versions of this coffee maker there are out there. Thats a good indicator of a real problem with the quality control on this product.An expensive piece of JUNK!"
3,Stopped working,"I have owned the machine about 2 1/2 yrs. I haven't been annoyed by the noise or the cleaning because of the convenience. But in the year before it just quit, the grinding container became very difficult to remove, at one point I had to get it out with pliers. That was annoying! Subsequently the machine wouldn't brew the entire amount of water. Just stopped. I could restart it, but another big annoyance. I won't get another all in one like this, though it's a great idea. Back to the burr grinder."
1,Poor design...junk,"Do not buy it. We got this as a Christmas present two years ago & right away I spotted a design flaw. I noticed when you make your coffee that the heat & steam rises in to the control panel above the carafe causing all sorts of malfunctions. Needless to say we sent it back to the manufacturer for a replacement (boy, did that take forever & a day) when we got the the replacement it called it quits after 5 months by only producing half of the coffee you made. We maintained both very well & changed the water filters as instructed but this thing failed again & again."
1,Soft Toilet,"This seat was bought for my 87 year old Mother that has Arthritis. She couldn't bend her knees to sit down. This seat has helped her very much. It fits well, doesn't move, so she feels comfortable. Thanks"
1,MST3K Fodder,The only redeeming quality of this video is that MST3K featured it on their show. The plot seems thrown together and the acting isn't all that great. Better to watch it being lampooned than to watch it straight.
3,MST keeps you interested in the movie...,"...without them, it's a tough one to slog through because of the piss-poor acting, terrible screenwriting, questionable editing, ridiculous premise, plot inconsistencies -- shall I go on? It's a bad movie! The only thing it's got going for it is some pretty good eye candy (on both sides). Oh, and this *is* the unedited version, if you're interested in the scene with Valeria and the Pleasure Machine. So for $4 (VHS) it's worth the price of admission!"
3,Kids Games,A little boring & not as easy to use - but on old computer and forgot what it was like to use these old games. Daughter is having fun with it. Fast delivery - good quality CD>
5,Satanic Fiction,"This book is a collection of fiction stories by some of the best Horror writers of our century. The stories are unbelievable and form a sort of survey of supernatural fiction. The biggest fault of the book is a vapid attempt by the author to pass off the fiction as reality. If you can ignore this bit of foolishness, you'll really enjoy the book."
3,Dvd Quality Without the Features,"The picture quality is good, but I was very disappointed in the product because of the lack of ability to select a track to view, or to move around on the dvd. It has none of the index or tracking features associated with a true dvd. It was obviously copied from some other format such as vhs. However, unlike vhs, you cannot move ahead or go back to a certain performance. You can only view from beginning to end, every time. If you have a favorite star skating 9th, you must watch all eight of the preceding performances first. Unbelievable!!Two of the three ""videos"" are less than an hour long. The third is just over one hour. Very disappointing. Also, I would have preferred to see more stars skate at least once instead of encore performances by some stars."
2,Questionable,"I just bought this album today, and I have to say, I was a bit disappointed. Sure, the idea of 10 one minute songs was original, but it's kind of a cheap gimmick. Plus, theres not much music when you cut out all the noise. What there was, I enjoyed, but full price for this is ridiculous, it's more of a single. Whirlwind Heat is still great, this was just... well, listen to the clips on Amazon, its half the album."
2,Waste of money!,"Please...don't purchase this book when you could have so many others for less than half the price and with hundreds more recipes. Seriously, you are only paying for the NAME of this book."
4,Hella Clear Stone Sheild,Nice product fitts hella lights like a glove. Will update if does not last long but for now looks great. Would have given 5stars if price was lower seems expensive for a piece of plastic...
5,cheap insurance,"Not much to really say about them. They are exactly what the picture shows. They fit great and protect the glass lenses. I've ran thru heavy brush offroading, thru the automated washes and thru the Northeast winters with no issues. I'm willing to bet if you manage to break one once its installed you probably broke the light anyway."
4,Very girlish!,"This purse is really cool. Lots of pockets with labels, so you don't have to think a lot to keep it organized. But I expected another type of fabric. This one doesn't seem bad, but, judging by the pictures, I expected something else that I can't describe."
5,a must read - best book on the subject i have read,Truly mind opening. A perspective that makes sense historically and for today's world. Highly recommended!
3,Starts with the negative,"I hate children's books that assume the child will have a hard time with the new situation. That's exactly what this one does--it lays out all the negatives of moving and everything that could go wrong, before coming to a somewhat positive conclusion. The UsborneMoving House (Usborne First Experiences)book is much better for preparing a young child for a move, in my opinion."
5,easy for a 5 year old to understand,"A little girl in my daughters pre-school class was moving and I bought this book for her and I read it to my daughter before the move. This is a real sweet book and had my daughter asking questions about her friends move. this helped start a converstation on the subject which was very helpful for my little girl. She realized moving is ok and her friend will make other friends at her new home, but she will still think of her friends here. Very sweet book, I'm glad I bought it!"
2,I was bored & disappointed,"As hard as I tried I just could not get into this book. Our heroine Cheopatra is not the brightest crayon in the box. And Michael is a most disappointing hero.Michael is a campanion (regular food source of blood for a vampire)not a slave but always on call. A vampire can have several campanion's and it doesnt have to be sexual unless both agree. Cleopatra is a vampire (very rare for a female to be made) and her sire kept her ignorent of the fact that there are campaion's and a vampire society etc....that when it stops being interesting.This books has no stucture. Things seem to to added because you find that as it goes along it isnt making sense the author must realize this to and trys to cover it by suddenly bringing in an explanation out of the blue. Instead of deveoping all of this, alot of time is spent on the sex. Now I love a good sex scene that's why I buy these books, but not at the expense of what could be a good story,its just not enough."
5,Wonderful gift!,Wonderful sentiment and great ornament for our Christmas tree! Terrific reminder of our wonderful family trip to Ireland last summer!
1,Not Recommended,"Your much better off spending the extra money for a better holster. Phone feel out on several occasions. Then the holster snapped a the swivel point & broke while getting into car. Nothing like the original, which lasted for 2 years under the same wear & abuse. This one lasted for only about a month."
3,MANY UPGRADING GISTS; NOTHING ABOUT FIXING PCs,"This book is strictly for beginners. It is well-organized, and offered test-questions at the end of each chapter. Every upgrading gist a beginner should know was included. But contrary to its name, there is not even a single chapter which discussed how to fix an ailing PC.Also, the user-level of this book compares to what ""For Dummies"" series offer. Thus, if you are not a real beginner, there is little to gain by acquiring it. However, if you are indeed a beginner, I must do about-turn, and say that it is worth spending on. Its style of handling hardware may appeal to you."
1,Save your money,"Looks good but is not functionally adequate. Is two pieces that keep coming unsnapped and when open block the camera viewfinder. Also, very weak clip."
2,"Love the look, but it comes apart easily","It's not very good quality. I really like how it looks, but it always comes unsnapped, so therefore impossible to use. It's completely a waste of money unfortunately."
2,early model magellan marine gps,"compared to today's gps this is a very limited product. hard to view small screen, not in color, slow to find satellites. pretty much obsolete"
5,BUY THIS DISC.,"This is a fantastic recording of one of my favorite bands. Music,(for me anyway), is a force of nature which challenges/provokes/delights/disgusts the listener. This disc is full of music which draws me in. I love the harmonies, I love the dissonance, I love the rhythm. I love the images and reflections that this music creates. I love the fact that there is a market for music which bears no resemblance to the pre-digested goo we tend to hear on pop radio/MTV. If you're of a similar mind, or similar ears, BUY THIS DISC. And, if you want to broaden your mind, go read some of the features and interviews at a king crimson website, like elephant-talk.com. Enjoy!"
4,Nice live album--but not their best,"I saw King Crimson live in Seattle in 1996, and it was one of the best concerts that I have ever experienced (in ANY genre of music). This live album is gradually growing on me, but this performance lacks the finesse and subtle precision the band evinced at that 1996 show that I was at. The recording presents KC's more bombastic elements. It's high energy rock'n'roll without the intense daring and abandonment that I experienced at that brilliant live show. The song, ""People"" is rather cheesy; it sounds exactly like what dinosaur prog rockers would be doing in the nineties, a throwaway meaningless ditty with rather silly words and precise, boring musicianship.I'd rather listen to ""Three of A Perfect Pair"" any day of the week. Now that album is a masterpiece on every level! I love KC, but I don't love everything they ever did or that they do."
3,not at it's own standard,"For any other gropu than King Crimson this would be an great live record. On earlier live recordings KC have how ever put it's on ribbon at an high level, which is not quite achieved on this record."
4,"Yes people, there is a Daphne (single)","Reviewer Halltristan is correct, it does exist like he said as a 1-song promo CD-single. There is a different mix of ""Daphne Descends (Kerry B. Mix)"" on both the US and UK versions of the ""Perfect"" (3-song) CD-single . Though the US and UK singles have a different additional (third) song on each. There were a number of odd singles releases from the Adore sessions, both CD and vinyl. Several were promo only releases and one-song ""DJ"" CD and 7"" 45rpm vinyl singles. By-the-way, Kerry B. is Kerry Brown, D'Arcy's husband and the drummer in the band Catherine. Yes, Adore may be a strange album from the then three-piece Smashing Pumpkins, but I think it has some very deep and beautiful music on it. Yes, of course I feel MCIS & SD should both be rated 10 out of 5 stars, i.e. 200% of the best!"
3,THIS SMELLS,"listen people! let me give the world to you was ONLY on machina II and blissed and gone was on the limited edition disc with Machina. There was no video for this and would have been on maybe greatest hits album or video.Trust me on this, if anyone knows better please inform me!;)"
4,they had to make the change,"adore simply follows the pumpkins trend of always being ahead of every body else. it may not rock... but its definately cool. plus daphne descends is one of the better songs off that album, so, its single couldn't be bad."
1,Shut up,"Don't take your anger out on AOLers. At least half are bad, maybe more, but still. Don't disregard the good part."
3,DUNNO,"THIS DUZ NOT EXIST! WHY IS THIS BEING SOLD? I NEVER HEARD THEY RELEASED IT, NEVER SEEN A VIDEO, AND WAS NOT ON THE ROTTEN APPLES CD EITHER!I DONT HAVE THIS BUT THE 2 BSIDES IF WHAT IVE HEARD ARE GOOD ANYWAYIS THIS A STINKIN BOOTLEG PR SOMETHIN?"
1,the funding for adore is nill.,"there will be no more singles from adore, no new t-shirts or hats. that's straight from their official website too. and why would they release a single off an old album? the new one comes out in september..."
5,The only nightmares I crave,"The sound of Las Pesadillas is damn nigh impossible to define, and it's equally impossible to take this CD out of your daily rotation once you've heard it a few times. Quantum Immortality is a heady mix reminiscent of Danny Elfman, Tom Waits, the Pixies, Eastern European gypsy campfire sing-alongs, prog rock and carnival songs. Listen to it three times under a full moon and your life will be changed."
3,"So,So...","The beginning and ending were pretty good. But to me it seemed like much of the middle of the book was just a lot of fluff. One after another of these legal cases, some of them beyond ridiculous. Like the paternity suit that the main character wins because the baby has the same nervous tick of licking his lips as the supposed father.. WHAT? Artistic/Literary license is one thing.. But wow some of these legal cases in the book were really out there. I don't know, maybe I'm being too critical.Anyway, IMO a so, so book."
3,A Bit Frustrating,"This book was superbly written. The pace was perfect and the characters intriguing. However! I agree with the reviewer who pointed out some of the obvious flaws, such as: the press, mafia, and powerful politician in Jennifer's life would, most certainly, have found out about her son since Jennifer was such a well-known media darling.I thought the ending frankly disappointing. While realistic, it could have been better handled, I think, and not quite so abrupt. I was deeply engrossed in this book and when it ended so negatively it was a major let-down. But, having said that, Mr. Sheldon is certainly a great storyteller and I'm not sorry I read this book."
3,A bit dissapointed....,"Jennifer Parker has finally accomplished what she has worked her whole life for, being a lawyer. Her dreams come crashing down on her first day at trial and her first day on the job and she is now facing jail and disbarrment. The story that follows is of Jennifer overcoming obstacles and prevailing. I don't believe that as popular as she was that no one would have known about her son.I was so dissapointed with the ending that I almost cried. It was the biggest letdown that I have had in a book and I have read some books that have bad endings. That is why I had to give this book three stars."
4,Crime/Law Drama Masterpiece,"I was 12 years old when I first read Sidney Sheldon's Rage of Angels, that was 29 years ago and I am still impacted by this book. The story chronicles the life of a female lawyer who faces the ultimate professional disgrace, she endures being targeted by high-ranking organized crime members, and finally, she suffers the ultimate loss as a mother. Sidney Sheldon's classic novel, Rage of Angels, is still as gripping today as it was yesterday. Check it out if you enjoy shamelessly throwing yourself into an engrossing, fast-paced drama every now and then."
3,But the ending...,"Sidney Sheldon was a great author and I thought that I had read all of his books until I saw this one on the free kindle best sellers list. Just like most of Sheldon's book, the plot is great. It is a fantastic story line, exciting, twisting and energetic. But the ending stinks. I think he ran out of time and wrapped it up too fast. The ending will leave you wondering why the author just ripped off the reader like that."
5,A Page Turner by Sidney Sheldon,"This was the first book I have read in a long time and it gave me a feeling that I have been missing out on a lot of fun not reading. It is a master peace by Sidney Sheldon who writes about a woman named Jennifer Parker. She is a Rock Bolboa type lawyer who has all the odds against her, but overcomes them and succeeds. Jennifer fights only for the truth at any cost until her morality conflicts with her needs. I really enjoyed the ending because it was realistic one and not the typical Cinderella type. Sheldon paints a very accurate real life picture of the way power corrupts."
2,Disappointing ending,"I love Sidney Sheldon's books, but I was quite disappointed with this one. I can't believe it got such good reviews. The story was fast-paced, interesting, and well written. However, the ending was awful and frustrating. It was too abrupt and too many things happened at once, it didn't resolve well. It was also too much of a let down. There are definitely better Sidney Sheldon books than this one."
2,Let down!,"I am definitely a Sidney Sheldon fan, but I was disappointed with this story. I was never sure if I was supposed to be rooting for or against the Jennifer character. After reading the book, my first thought was, what was the purpose in reading this book. Usually I feel good or bad after reading a book. After reading this book, I felt like I had wasted my time. I also felt that there were several loose ends not dealt with in this story, e.g., Adam's wife, Ken."
4,"Very good, alittle slow starting","This the first Sidney Sheldon book I have read and I was alittle hestitant when I first started reading the book because I don't care for trail books, but it really took off. It was a good book, there were times when it was hard to put down. I will read another one of his books soon."
4,Incredible!,"When you start reading this book you have no idea what you are getting yourself into! You can't stop reading! Plus it has so many plot twists that by the end you can't remember how it started. The characters are so well outlined, I found myself thinking like Jennifer! If you've been looking for a good book, this is it. I'm a newborn Sidney Sheldon fan! The ending may dissapoint you a bit......but the story is worth it!"
1,so predictable,"i like sheldon, but this book was so average. i couldn't finish it. jennifer with little if any experience becomes perry mason in just a few months!everything she touches turns to gold. the story line has been used for decades. even the names of the mafia guys come from the ""godfather"".just plain dissapointing"
5,"Wonderful book, sad ending though","I bought this book just a month ago, I finished reading it a couple of days. I love it, I love the courtroom scenes, and the beautiful and poignant love story of Jennifer and Adam. It is really so sad though, why did their son Joshua have to die? It has a sad ending too, but Jennifer is a survivor.My cousin read it too, she loves it. We both love ""Master of the Game"" too. I have read and enjoyed all Sidney Sheldon novels except ""Tell me your dreams."" I'm planning to buy it yet. He is the best, incomparable."
2,Unfinishable,"If 'unfinishable' is a word then it describes this book for me. I love love loved The Other Side of Midnight but haven't liked another Sheldon book since. I found the 'heroine' completely unlikeable. I think we were supposed to see a strong, gutsy, independent woman but time and again she went against her stated beliefs. Besides she was generally annoying. The scene with the nails (if you read it you know what I mean...) was ridiculously sugar coated, then when that is 'resolved' she goes home and does WHAT? Seriously? I could probably have taken all her hypocrisy if her character had been better developed such that she had some deeper reason for her stupid behavior, but instead she's written to be brilliant and outside of the court room is anything but. I wasn't expecting much more than a good read - not a classic or deep tome - but sheesh, I didn't even get that."
3,Angels With Dirty Cases,"Sheldon's story of the woman lawyer Jennifer Parker, who comes back from an inauspicious beginning to rise to the top of her profession, is entertaining, to be sure, but never to be confused with edifying or believable literature. Don't expect depth, realism, or nuance. There's much here to keep one turning the pages, and that's about all there is. Sometimes that's all that one wants from a book, though, and if it's one of those times for you, you can do much worse than Sidney Sheldon.Jennifer's men are sexy, her triumphs and tragedies are absorbing, and there's enough variety that things never drag. She isn't always a candidate for sainthood, either, which makes her more interesting to read about. Sheldon's done better, but I'd say he did okay here."
5,excellent read.,This is came highly recommended from an avid reader. I could not put the book down.. I enjoyed it from strart to finish.. I purchased three more books from Sidney Sheldon....Keep up the good work
4,An older legal thriller that has aged surprisingly well,"I apparently picked this up as a Kindle freebie in May 2010 -- since it was first published in 1980, I'm guessing it was maybe a 30-year anniversary celebration freebie or something. Not being very familiar with novels written shortly before I was born, I had no idea how old the book was.On the whole, it's aged very well. It reads a lot like a combination of John Grisham's best legal thrillers with some Mario Puzo's Godfather thrown in. The storyline had several major twists, basically all of which succeeded in surprising me.I even enjoyed the parts of the book that were a little dated -- references to national heroes whose names I didn't recognize piqued my curiosity, and a scene where the main character is trying to complete the ""nearly impossible"" task of winning a paternity suit made me chuckle. But the dated parts were fewer than you might think... the main character even turns to Lexis and Westlaw for her legal research, just like I do!"
4,Nice read - Rage of Angels,"I really enjoyed this book. My wife gave it to me. The twists of the story and the characters make this book a real page-turner, and Sheldon creates well-rounded characters that you'll laugh and cry with. Don't pass up this novel! This was the first book that I read by Sidney Sheldon, and I was blown away. I finished it in one day and loved every second of it. His protagonist, Jennifer Parker, is a woman with ambition whose career as a lawyer is nearly terminated by a man who later comes to like her."
5,Good quality,This set worked out great and I know I can usually trust Fel-Pro gasket sets. Make sure and get the OEM camshaft seal though.
2,Save your money,"If you want a good gazeteer for the world of Greyhawk, buy the Living Greyhawk Gazeteer. This is good as a refresher, or if yo just need the map. It's size means the info on everything is limited. Very brief writeups on the various countries and factions don't have enough meat to make your own campaigns off of unless you're looking to make the Greyhawk world your own creation. But if that's the case, why aren't you creating your own world instead of buying an official one? Save the money and buy the Living GreyHawk book. It has more to it and is more worth the money."
1,"This isn't a good buy, no matter who you are","If you are an old Greyhawk fan, this is all common knowledge. If you are getting into Greyhawk, get the Living Greyhawk Gazeteer as this smaller version is way too small to be of any real use. Sure it is only 8 dollars, but you may as well burn the money because this book, if interesting, can ONLY make you want the bigger version, and if you don't find it interesting, well... that speaks for itself."
4,Not as bad as all that...,"I'm relatively new to gaming in general, but this is the absolute first time I've touched Greyhawk. It's also the first time I've run a D&D game.My first feeling when I opened this book was disappointment. I wanted more info! So I pouted for a week and then opened it again. What I discovered on a second look was that it left lots of space for me to fill in. And that my friends is the core of a true Dungeon Master: ""What can I add to make this my own?"" I've taken some of the story hints they've given and started writing my own campaign. I've mixed some things, made up others and I *like* what I've ended up with. The Gazetteer is a great starting point. Where you take it is up to you.As an aside, I *am* unhappy with the included map. It serves its purpose to an extent, but it is bland and does not delineate borders well at all. I'm left uncertain if cities lie in one country or the next. But as above I will fill in myself what WOTC has left blank."
3,"Decent enough in it's own way, but....","Speaking as a long-time D&D player who finally got into Greyhawk after years of Realms play, I enjoyed this book but also purchased the much larger living Greyhawk Gazetteer. I would reccomend the Living Greyhawk product instead because it's not that much more expensive, and you get lots more information, detail, and history for your money. So, not to knock this product, which is great in it's own way, but I would go for the Living Greyhawk Gazzetter were I you."
4,Too Small,"This case seems to be very strong and well built. But unfortunately I had to return it. It didn't fit my new HP 17inch laptop. So if you have a bigger laptop, this case might not work for you. However, if yours will fit, it seemed like a great case."
2,Torn Seam and Broken Zipper,"I have had this bag for a few months and used it occasionally. It has been great until a few days ago. Three weeks ago I started using it daily and in that time, one of the side seams has come undone and a zipper on the smaller outer pocket broke off, which was the least used pocket. It still carries my laptop with no problem, but I will go with a different brand next time that provides a quality guarantee of some sort. I cannot find any customer service contact for Microsoft bags.*EditI followed the support link given in the comment to my review. Submitted a support request. Never received a response.Also, one day I picked up the bag by the strap and the plastic clip broke off. No more strap. Looking for a replacement.I did like the style, but not happy with workmanship"
2,shoulder strap is very unsafe,the strap hook that grabs the briefcase is made of cheap plastic and comes off easily when you carry something heavy. I have a HP elitebook workstation 17 inches that weighs 7.5 pounds and ended up on the ground because the strap hook broke off.
4,Very pleased with this laptop bag,"I looked at many bags online and in the stores. This bag meets expectations and it was very affordable. It hasn't been used very heavily yet, but so far I am satisfied with this purchase. This is my first laptop so I was not really sure what kind of carrying case or bag would be best for me. The pictures and the descriptions, plus the customer reviews guided my purchase."
3,Okay,"Not quite the qualityor expandability we were hoping for, but an okay bag to hold some of the items for meetings, but nearly not enough."
5,Love it.,I have HP Pavilion G- 17 inch screen- fits perfectly. Item looks very sturdy and well put together.Love the interior color that helps everything pop so you can see better. Love all the pockets for putting things and helping to keep better organized so not searching and digging in bag. Excellent value and quality!
4,good bag,"A good sturdy bag. The only thing is it is a little tight with my 17"" laptop, but it still fits."
5,Very nice case,"The delivery was prompt and the product is great. This case has enough space to hold all accessories for the notebook and it has lots of pockets for other stuff and, as stated in the product overview, it has a velcro attachment that can be adjusted to the size of your notebook. My notebook is 12.1 inches and it fits perfectly. If I had a 17inch notebook I could easily adjust the space to fit.I highly recommend this product. It is also very sturdy."
5,Top notch case,This was purchased as a gift (this item specifically requested)for my son who has had numerous cases and who takes his laptop a lot of places. He was very pleased with it. I was a little surprised by its light orange interior ( my case's is black ) but he said he especially liked it because it made it much easier to see things in the bag when lighting wasn't optimal. He was right. Roomy and well padded.
5,Absolutely Perfect,"Wow I love this case. I wasn't going to buy it because I didn't know if I would get much use out of it now that I'm retired but when I saw it even if I use it once it was worth it. It has a pocket for anything and everything. The color is somewhat different/darker than the picture. The picture to me looks light grey on Amazon but the bag is accually a very dark grey or black. I don't care about that particularly because the orange details are what catches your eye. The construction is unbelievable for the money. Many zippers and you can tell by operating them they will last. Nice compartment for the laptop itself with a nice amount of padding. I have a 17.3"" so the selection is a bit limited. This bag is big enough but not too big to be balky. I think it is difficult to judge this type of thing on the internet but this one is all I would ever want it to be. Now I can't wait to go somewhere!!"
5,computer tote bag,"This bag is great! It is full of extra zippered pouches and it's sturdy and weather-proof. It holds my 17"" lap top and has pouches for my mouse, pens and pencils, battery & chord. I can stuff this bag full of notepads,magazines,paperbacks and other accessories and it still closes. It even has a side pouch for a water bottle. The strap is wide and it doesn't dig into my shoulder. This bag is sleak, sturdy and functional."
3,Pretty good laptop case,"This is an excellent laptop bag as long as you don't carry any bulky items except the laptop. I tend to carry a lot of books also and the bag gets out of balance and very bulky. Doesn't hold a lot of stuff for a bag this big. Has lot of small pockets, but is lacking dedicated slots for your pens and pencils, which seems odd."
4,My first laptop bag,"This bag is very adequate for the person who doesn't need one for every day, and I only take my computer with me once in a while. The only problem I see is that the cushioning in the bottom, when it's standing up does not adequately cushion the laptop, but I just put a strip of foam rubber in, and it works fine. I would recommend it for non-business use."
4,New to Shona Language,"As a person whose dearest friends speak Shona, I was looking for a tool to increase my skills to learn their first language. Shona is a difficult language in which syntex and variations of words are common. Even with this tool, most of the words they write to me are not included in the dictionary, and I still need to write friends for assistance with interpretations. With that said, at least it is a tool. Since Shona is not a widely used language, it is a real treat to have this tool!"
3,Decent Introduction,"In general, this is a decent book (considering the general availability and quality of books for Shona), but there are some serious problems with the general structure and pedagogical approach, in my opinion. For instance, one section discusses the fact that certain letter combinations in Shona have a very non-intuitive pronunciation, and lists some examples--but it doesn't provide an actual pronunciation! So all you can learn is that your intuition will be wrong, but not what is correct! Omissions like this make the book nice for a Shona book, but quite poor for a language learning resource in general."
2,I think I've been here before...,"Aaaaarrrrrrggghh. I can't believe I blithely purchase everything with David Sylvian's name on it. With the exception of a remix or two (Wave is nice, but did I really need another version?) and 'The Song Which Gives The Key To Perfection', I already have everything from other sources. Conceptually, it doesn't even work as a collection because there is no flow or consistent tone to the pieces. Ambient here, vocal there, experimental after that. Bleah.In the same purchase from Amazon, I also ordered JBK 'Playing in a Room With People', so it was kind of a double whammy for me. Now I have 'Big Wheels In Shanty Town' on three CDs. If JBK and Sylvian love this piece so much to release it three times, perhaps this is proof that they should record another album together.After Everything and Nothing, Approaching Silence, and now Camphor, I'm ready for some new music."
5,Fantastic compilation of a brilliant artist,"Wonderful compilation. Highlights include Plight (the spiralling of winter ghosts) on disc two, Upon This Earth, Praise, and The Song Which Gives the Key to Perfection."
2,Not the best Sanskrit Primer,"Coulson's text is a nightmare to use if you don't already know some Sanskrit. I highly suggest starting off with Thomas Egenes ""Introduction to Sanskrit, Part I."" Egenes text consists of 18 concise but simple lessons which provide one with a foundation in basic Sanskrit for building upon with more a thorough text. (In fact, Egenes states that his text is a ""pre-primer;"" I have to say, it is a most excellent one.) Coulson's text becomes much easier to comprehend.I also recommend taking a look at Devavanipravesika, the text used by Berkeley for its Sanskrit course. It is very thorough and not as difficult as Coulson's."
1,I bought and returned this book!,"This book is not meant for anybody to learn Sanskrit. It covers too many topics in too few pages. To make matters worse, quality of paper used in this book is really bad. Also, binding of the book is that of a cheap thriller and it is really hard to keep it open while reading.One good thing about this book is that, all Exercises have their Solutions, and in my knowledge Egenes's ""Introduction to Sanskrit"" is the only other book on Introductory Sanskrit which provides the key to exercises.If someone wants an inexpensive book to learn Sanskrit, one can get Charles Wikner's book ""Sanskrit Introductory"" available as a free download. Although it does not cover all the material in an introductory Sanskrit course, it is better than this book to get started."
1,For professors not for learners,"I can certainly recommend this book to all university professors teaching Sanskrit and to all those individuals who know everything about Sanskrit, and now want to see what the respectable author has to say and know about Sanskrit.But if you do not know Sanskrit and want to learn it, do not spend your money and do not waste your time on this book. I love `Teach yourself ...' series, I used some of their books and this book was my first disappointment in that series.On three occasions I started my study but I could not go past the first chapter. The author assumes not only that you know Greek and Latin but also that you know Sanskrit and then passing lightly over important grammatical points and rules, spends most of his and yours time to give you some subtle hints about some exotic uses of Sanskrit grammar.So avoid this `Look what I know about Sanskrit, you will never be as clever as I am' book and try something else."
2,How could a college (UT) have used this book?,"This book failed me. The author writes in a style that, by today's casual standards, seems more suited to a highbrow English college (like the Cambridge of yesteryear). The font is terrifically small, the explanations didactic. I was told that the author later committed suicide, which I find plausible. Out of the 13 or so people in the Sanskrit class which used this text, only three failed to drop out; those three were already ""linguistically accomplished"" and could make some sense of it. In the beginning of the class, I handed everyone a sheet with the alphabet on it (not from the book); later, people said that without that favor, they'd have dropped out a lot sooner. I think Egenes or Bucknell's (sp?) book is probably a safer bet. I have Egenes' and I've gotten alot out of it. Or you can join the Sanskrit for Social Change movement (no kidding). Burn this book."
4,A real good book to learn Sanskrit,"A real good book to learn Sanskrit for begineers. Since my mother-tongue is Marathi it was no big trouble to learn the script, but at the same time it places me in a better position to judge the the matter in the book. Looking forward for an Advanced Sanskrit from the same author"
1,not worth it,"Battery last only two days max on full charge, really not worth the price at all. Very disappointed. Will never buy this item again."
5,Canon 15mm Fisheye lens,"I have always been a wide angle lens fan, so when I got a new Canon 5D body I decided to get this lens too.I am very pleased with the brilliant optical performance, but don't think that it is a limited use lens because of the distortion inherent in a full frame fish-eye.Using my image manipulation software (Paintshop Pro 8) I have corrected the distortion and obtained some stunning wide screen format landscapes which would have required 4 or 5 shots with a standard lens stitched together and the compromises that brings in matching brightness in the join areas.After a couple of months use I have found many more uses for this lens than I had imagined, I take it with me everywhere.The ceiling of a mediaeval cathedral shot with the lens pointing vertically up is a revelation in detail and design which is hard to appreciate with any other lens."
4,"Take it from the ""old soap salesman""","Lou offers great insight and wisdom in the art of ""human engineering"" - training managers to become true leaders. Being part of the greatest generation, Lou captures a slice of American salesmanship that makes this country great today. While some of the stories may seem dated, anyone that has customers or business associates can learn from the pages of this book regardless of industry, timeframe or position. I have ordered copies of this book for employees from entry-level to CEO. All have come back to say thanks and have forwarded it on for someone else to read!"
3,Not An Easy Read,"Definitely a manual/lessons learned for Soviet leaders or those who have to read it for a class, etc... I couldn't get past page 84. The book couldn't keep my attention. I recommend reading ""The Other Side of The Mountain."" Mujahideen Tactics in the Soviet-Afghan War. This book is a testimonial of how the Mujahideen fought and defeated the Soviets. Much more engaging......"
4,The Soviet-Afghan War,"Probably the only book which more or less accurately describes the Soviet military experience in Afghanistan. A collection of post-war analyses by Soviet officers, it contains the usual communist view of ""what went wrong."" While most of these distortions were identified by the author, he did fail to show the vast difference between the Russian and American military mindsets which continues to plague the Russians."
2,"A good reference, but boring","I love history, but it has to have a decent narrative. This book does have history, but a good narrative appears sporadically. While better than scholarly writing, this just won't keep you glued to your seat. If you can push yourself to finish you deserve a pat on the back, but don't buy this book if you need to be enthralled."
3,"Insightful in spots, tedious in others.","I read Gary Wills book with great expectationsin preparation for a trip to Venice in February.It provided a wealth of historical information thatcannot be found in the ""tour books"" and yet, was anoverall disappointment. The book became most tediouswhen it ventured into the art of Titian, Giorgione, et al.The non-color photographs were poorly produced anddifficult to see, let alone enjoy, in contrast to thelimited number of color plates that do appear. Greater in-depth treatment of the doges and their families would have made this a more interesting study. Perhaps I'll have a greater appreciation for the book after my return from our trip."
2,Self-defeating,"Wills' intention is to ""look at the history through the art, the art through the history."" As a result, the book depends very much on its illustrations, and these are unfortunately miserably poor. When a work being discussed is reproduced at all, the reproduction is likely to be a dark smudge of ink about the size of a playing card. The result is a very frustrating reading experience that I wouldn't wish on anyone."
1,Slash and Burn,"This live recording from 1939 repeats most of the features of Mengelberg's other Tchaikovsky Fifths, especially in the first and last movements: the finely-articulated clarinet introduction which anticipates the rhythmic motif of the first subjects in both movements; the intensity and control of forte passages; the slow-downs and accelerations for emotional impact; the unaccountable cuts in the last movement. But the symphony's not all there! The second movement begins half-way through, long after the famous horn solo, and lasts only six minutes. Whether the original lacquers were defective or missing or whether Dante/Lys goofed is unknown, but the omission is disastrous, and makes this CD one to avoid. It would be better to find the earlier studio Columbia recording of the Mengelberg Fifth on M & A or the later, better recorded studio Telefunken Mengelberg Fifth, also on Lys and which has all the virtues and none of the egregious defects of this issue."
1,Software modems,The best modems for the money by far are the Intel chipset PCI hardware modems . They install very easily and will work 99.9% of the time. These are a no-brainer. I've installed close to 100 of these & there is NO comparison. Quit wasting your time with junk.
4,A Brief Introduction to Psychodynamic Theory,"It seems unfair to fault this work for being brief, but that's it's problem. The authors do a terrific job of describing (and evaluating) the contributions of Freud's students. One might wish for a slightly less politically correct assessment of certain theorists' contributions--certain writers date themselves, and don't need the authors to point out, quite so thoroughly, how they're dated. The organization of the book is very helpful--there are chapters on Ego Psychology, Object Relations, Self Psychology. Klein is very well and clearly explicated. There are two very helpful chapters at the end of the book on characterological disorders (one on Borderline, one on Narcissistic). I would have liked a little more on some of the people *I* find difficult, such as Lacan, Alice Miller, Julia Kristeva. But if you're looking for a highly intelligent and readable historiography of psychodynamics, this is the book for you."
5,TEXT BOOK FOR POST GRAD. PSYCHOLOGY,"This book is an excellent additional reader for post grad. psychology - particularly Therapeutic Styles. It has a strong leaning toward the psychodynamic schools of thinking, particularly: FREUD, SELF-PSYCHOLOGY,EGO & PSYCHOSOCIAL EGO DEVELOPMENT (Erikson) and has good critical views on Personality Disorders & depression. This was suggested as additional reading material - and I found it so beneficial - I bought the book!"
3,Not the healthy book I was looking for...,"The book is certainly lovely and photographed well. The introductions at the beginning of each section outline the fruit or vegetable type, (i.e. stone fruits, root vegetables) then give a brief description of the item and how it can be used. Then comes a section of recipes using those items.However, most of the recipes put fruit into tarts, pastries and pies and load them up with cream and sugar, while most of the vegetable recipes have the veggies hidden under cheese, cream, doughs and stuffed in turnovers and tarts. I was looking for a daily healthy option for different fruits and vegetables, but most of these recipes would be at most for once in a while or for entertaining. No calorie data provided, but 1 cup of parmesan and 1 cup heavy cream with a little vegetable thrown in gives you a good idea.Beautiful book, but not if you're looking for clean healthy recipes."
4,good looking set,I gave it 4 stars because white and green blend in a lot. I thought it would have little bit more contrast. Also chess pieces don't have soft padding on the bottom. Overall it is beautiful.
1,cost too much,why would you buy this out of date piece of crap for over 55 dollars when the top of the line CPU from AMD with 8 cores not 2!!!! is only $200...i wouldnt buy from anyone this out of touch.
2,Useful conversations; poor recordings.,"The ""Icelandic Converstaions"" cassette tapes contain lots of useful phrases for the student of Icelandic, and the transcription is the only written material I know of containing English and Icelandic side-by-side, which is a great tool for learning. However, the recording was done long ago on primitive equipment, and it's quality is so poor as to be almost unintelligible. The speakers talk really fast and often kind of mumble. The result is useless unless you can re-record the tapes digitally, boosting the high frequencies and slowing down the speed. There is also too much time wasted on between-conversation English instruction, and the written transcription contains several errors. Plus, in my copy at least, the transcription is missing one complete page. Buy it, because there is nothing else available, but the whole thing needs to be re-done."
3,Christian music with honky tonk soul,"If you like your Christian music with a taste of down and dirty blues and straight ahead country pickin' you should pick up a copy of RayBob's Christian's Christmas Blues. Frankly, I like his pickin' (he plays all the instruments) better than his singing which isn't bad. He sings from the heart and isn't afraid to let you know where he stands!"
4,Great book for the technically inclined,"An excellent review of automatic weapons for the technically inclined. There is little or no operational history involved, but this book's detailed development histories of weapons and their ammunition is more comprehensive than anything I've seen since Johnson's books from the '40s. If you are into the details of automatic weapons and the ammunition they fire, you must have this book. If you are looking for operational military history of how these weapons were employed, this is not for you."
5,its a hit,"Very informative, easy to read text - not too dry or technical. Great photos & diagrams. Really helps to understand the auto loading mechanisms of many different weapons, their performance data, specifications. Glad to have this in my collection, definately recommend it."
5,Good nail bag,Custom Leathercraft makes the best bags I have found in the 30 plus years that I've been in construction. Sometimes they're hard to find but they're worth looking for.
5,Word World DVD,"The DVD's from Word World are absolutely entertaining and full of learning. My 3 year old daughter absolutely loves these DVD's and she is learning her letters and their sounds. She can even identify certain words like dog, duck, and frog. Of course, her favorite characters, but still for just turning 3 I am quite impressed. I highly recommend these DVD's for any toddler."
3,Robert strokes himself (again),"I'm not going to comment on the music, just the liner notes.Note to Robert: WILL YOU EVER SHUT UP ABOUT YOUR PRIVATE LIFE? This CD's notes blab on and on about your business/performance philosophies. Do you really think we will appreciate your music more now that we understand that you consider audience member's cameras intrusive? How about a word or two providing specific details of how this remarkable Soundscapes process works? Jeez, if you can't say something relevant to your audience, then be quiet."
1,It's not music anymore!,"First of all, making the weirdest sounds possible on yourguitar and NOT trying to sound structured in any way has never been myidea of fun. Fripp does not even have to make it pretty to satisfy me-at least make it sound like something. Second, He DEFINETLY does not have to play it for 50 minutes at a time. Third, dragging the sound back and forth between the stereo channels reminds me more of '60s Bachelor Pad Music than ""art"". END"
1,"Ouch, I listened to this again!","I promised myself never to get rid of ANY of my CDs, even this one. Well, I made a mistake and listened to this again. It's worse than I remember it.The 'music' doesn't progress. It just stays there. It's much like listening to feedback. I really really dislike this record.Robert, just release an expanded verion of 'No Pussyfooting' and I'll forgive you. Or better yet, release CDs from the Fripp & Eno 1975 mini tour of Paris, London, et al."
4,Useful,I am using it to teach a university class. Students like it. So do I. Very comprehensive. Can't find anything better.
1,Horrible,The product was shipped empty. I grabbed the bottle and it was empty. What the hell? never buying this item and from this company ever again!
5,Don't fog without it,"Seriously, the difference is huge and this stuff is pretty cheap. Just use it. It's not overpowering. It's about the intensity of normal, un-mixed fog, but smells better."
2,Fun but not worth it,Not really worth it. Didn't notice much of a difference to the fog. It was cheap enough so it was worth a try but don't think I will waste the money again. Glad I didn't pay shipping
4,Pretty good,Shipping was fast and quality is very good. The book is a very good reference for finite element analysis but it's not your average fundamental reference.
4,meticulous explanations,"This is my first book on the FEM. It explains FEM using the concept of the weak formulation -- something that one obtains directly from the governing equation via multiplying by a test function and integrating over the domain. This point of view is more philosophically satisfying and holistic than the narrow matrix structural analysis approach which seems to mislead students into thinking that FEM can only be applied to structures and solids. Incidentally, this weak formulation is also the original one held by Richard Courant who is arguably the modern founder of the FEM. FEM is a complex subject and a lot of hand-holding is needed for beginners. The book succeeded admirably as it is interspersed with detailed numerical examples illustrating the preceding concepts. The author spares no effort to be as complete as possible in his derivations. However, his coverage of the Calculus of Variations seems a bit weak. Overall, highly recommended for a first course on the FEM!"
1,A big disappointment,"Ms. Jayanti is big on the history of tarot cards and obviously a psychology buff. She interprets the cards as a psychologist might see Rohrschach ink blots. ""I don't work with the tarot to predict the future,"" she says.Tarot is a great teaching tool for substance-abuse counselors, according to this author. She lets the client do the interpreting of the cards as pretty pictures, much as a psychiatrist might ask a patient to interpret ink blots.This author calls it a ""fallacy"" that some think tarot readings help you find out about your future.To her, the cards are merely a symbol system that can assist you in understanding yourself -- and you can forget about predictive readings for others. ""Lighting candles or saying prayers"" to her is ""just plain ignorant.""I'll take a book that tells me how to read the cards. If I want psychoanalysis, I'll go to a psychiatrist."
3,good for starter,"I bought this book because it came with standard rider deck, exactly what I wanted and as a beginner. I have no complain for the cards, but card interpretation in the book is somewhat different from other source and I am going to buy another book 'learning tarot for beginners' to make sure I learn about tarot. The book is thinner than full dummie version, which is good enough. I would recommend people to buy the set if you never owned tarot, but suggest to read other books for deeper understanding."
3,Tarot Card Book for Dummies,This book is helpful to the novice who wants to read tarot cards. Gives some simple patterns for reading and explains meanings.
3,KVMs will be KVMs,"This KVM model is very inexpensive and reasonably okay for most people. The KVM got stuck many times (once a week) and I had to reboot BOTH machines in order to fix it. What makes it worse is that I could not even push a button to go to the other session before turning off the machine (to verify if I had documents open that I may lose). There are some advance features, pushing a series of buttons in a row that do not seem to work. Also, USB 2.0 appears to be required, if you still have an old laptop with USB 1.1, don't waste your time with it. I had to use a USB 2.0 card to get it to work with this switch.For someone in school or someone on a tight budget this is a perfect item. For someone that is doing important/work related things with their computers, I would spend more and get something better. Probably from the same company, but definitely not this model. I have no plans to return mine, but the next one I buy will not be this model.R"
1,Laden with issues: nVidia chipset conflicts!,"When it works, it works great. When it doesn't work you pull your hair out troubleshooting. Non-USB KVM switches do not have the myriad of conflicts/compatibility issues that USB switches have. Personally, I have hooked this device to four different systems and it worked smoothly on only one of them.After a ton of online research I found that the nVidia chipset USB seems to have trouble with the ATEN/IOGear line of KVM switches. The small benefit of USB KVMs does not outweigh their inherent burdens."
2,still buggy,"This device did not work with my Saitek USB keyboard. When I emailed tech support, they told me it was not supported. I then switched to a Logitech keyboard, which worked fine, but I realized my Logitech mouse was skipping all over the screen on my PC, while it was smooth on my Mac. I ended up returning the product."
4,No Problems -- Easy Setup,I've been using it for a few weeks now and it works great. I'm using the Logitech Internet Navigator Keyboard and the Logitech MX1000 mouse with Windows XP Pro. I haven't installed the keyboard customizer software yet but all of the default hot key assignments work as expected.
2,Iogear not upfront in product description about conflicts,"Despite the mixed reviews here, I decided to gamble and take a chance on the Iogear GCS632U since I've had previous success with their switches. However, I immediately ran into problems with my mouse and keyboard. (Video looked great.) When I contacted Iogear support via their online form, they sent the following blurb back to me. I'm pasting it here so those of you who are still making a purchasing decision can have this information in addition to the incomplete product description provided above:""Please ensure that you are using a native wired mouse and keyboard as wireless devices or any types of converters/adapters are NOT supported and will not work. Also docking stations or port replicator will interfere with proper KVM functionality and special keys on multimedia keyboards are not supported and will not work."""
1,Not for wireless use,"The instruction manual on the IOGEAR web site finally solved my problem - the ""USB"" ports on the device aren't actually USB ports. They take a USB plug, but they don't pass the entire signal - they replicate keyboard and mouse ports, and don't allow combinations to pass all data. Skip this switch if your mouse and keyboard are on one USB cable, or you are using a wireless mouse/keyboard combo. It wouldn't even work with a wireless keyboard plugged into the KEYBOARD port and a wired mouse plugged into the MOUSE port. That's right, separate ports - should have tipped me off!"
5,work right off the box with XP and Vista,"Amazon is the cheapest that I found for this product. No software needed and works right out of the box. I have win XP and Vista and no problem at all. Just make sure you turn off both computer when first plugged in the switch else, just restart both computer and it should work."
2,"Good idea,not so great implementation","This unit cables up easily and the 'hot key' switching is very fast and effortless (I set it up so that tapping the control key twice flips it over).I was also shocked to see that it actually advertises Sun support (which I use)Sadly it occasionally drops keys and worse, often goes into repeat mode (where the last key you hit gets sent to the system in a torrent of characters). Not so bad if it's a normal character but a repeating backspace can do some damage to a document. The worst was a repeating mouse click that must have fired off 100 views of the same pdf document. That took real time to recover from.Tried changing keyboards but no improvement."
2,Mac and PC.,"This is a great idea for a product, but it falls short in it's implementation. I use it on a Power Mac 2x867Mhz and various Dell laptops. My keyboard frequently stops working and I have to unplug it from both computers so it will reset itself and start working again. I have basically stopped using it because of this problem. It may have to do with the computers going to sleep, but I'm not sure."
5,KVM Switch for PC to laptop,"this is the first KVM switch that i have found that allows you to connect two computers that use USB ports for the mouse and keyboard that actually works!one note however to gamers, if you are using a USB keyboard such as the Saitek that has a game pad attached to it you will lose the use of it as it does not recognise it."
2,I couldn't get this to work,"It just wouldn't work on one of my 2 pc's. Windows couldn't find a driver for it (Unrecognized USB Device). I did a lot of troubleshooting and eventually returned it. Support wasn't great, and they don't offer any drivers to download. I bought a different KVM that works fine."
2,"Worked, then didn't","It used to require constant (every hour or so) disconnection from both computers, but otherwise worked. I emailed support who said that my keyboard wasn't supported. I checked the documentation which said that the MULTIMEDIA FEATURES of my keyboard weren't supported (Microsoft Ergonomic 4000), and everything else should work (it didn't). I pointed this out and got no reply from support.Then after a month or so it suddenly made my keyboard and mouse go all squirrely on one of the machines. When I took it out of the loop everything was fine, but using the KVM it didn't recognize a keystroke, and then gave me 15x the same letter. I tried reinstallling drivers rebooting, rebooting etc etc, but it isn't the keyboard or the mouse that's the problem, it's the switch. So I'm back to no switch. Sigh.Sebb"
4,Works great!,"I was a little concerned with some of the negative reviews some people have had on this product, but I have been very pleased - no issues. My set up is slightly different since my desktop computer has a HD connector and my desktop has a SVGA. I ended up not connecting the desktop monitor to the KVM - it goes directly to the monitor. I then push a button on the monitor when I want to switch monitors. My monitor has a SVGA input which I connect the KVM into. Therefore when I want to switch from laptop to desktop, I hit the scroll lock twice and the input button on the monitor and the switching works great."
2,A mixed bag,"This KVM works great in the correct situations. If you want to hook a basic keyboard and mouse up between two computers then you should be just fine.However, if you use a docking station for a laptop it may not work. Apparently it draws more power than hooking up the same keyboard and mouse by themselves. This makes sense, but it seems to draw more than the power supply for the dock can provide. This resulted in the keyboard not working. The solution was to bypass the docking station and plug in directly to the laptop. That defeats the purpose of the docking station.This device also cannot handle special keyboards with multimedia features or special buttons.None of this would be a very big deal if it was made clear on the packaging. However, the package mentions none of these limitations, nor does the manufacturer website. I see others have had the same problems from some of the reviews, so beware."
1,Look elsewhere,"This thing would not work even with one computer. The USB part is totally unreliable--I could not get it to work with any of my three mice, keyboard worked intermittently (had to reconnect periodically). All of these work fine with the machine when connected directly.It does switch the video ok but it blue-screened my Windows box three times. After that, I stuffed it back in the box and back it goes with the UPS man. Good riddance!"
5,Works Great! No complaints.,"I bought this device about a year ago and it worked great until my darling cat decided to chew through the cable going to my second computer! Am buying a replacement and also purchasing some ""cable protector stuff"" to keep mister busy mouth from ruining another one :)"
4,Seems to work fine,"No real issues here, other than I really wish it had a hard switch on the front somewhere. Would be such a great feature at times. Sometimes when there's only one display plugged in, you have to physically switch the cables in order to get the display to show up."
1,Significantly Flawed Product!,"I, like many others interested in KVM switches, am trying to switch between two desktop PCs with the same monitor, keyboard, mouse, and sound. I have a regular PC desktop running Vista and a new Mac Mini with a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard combination.This product was designed so poorly that you CANNOT use a wireless keyboard/mouse combo since each USB port on the KVM switch must be plugged into both a keyboard and mouse, respectively. Most all keyboard/mouse combos use only one USB connection - which will not work with this switch! Iogear knows about this flaw and reports this information hidden in their website.If you do not use nor plan on ever buying a wireless keyboard/mouse combo, then maybe this device would work for you, but as so many people have found out already - this device is unacceptably designed and has required many product returns."
5,Great KVM switch for a great price,I use this KVM switch to connect my pc and my girlfriend's pc to one monitor. It's easy to install and use. I've been using it for 2 months if the KVM switch fails I will update my review. Really nothing else to say about it
1,JUNK,"I have had nothing but audio problems with the cheap 1/8"" connector. After one evening struggling with it and wiggling the connector one of the VGA signals went dim. Bypassed the IO vga and all was good...threw the thing away and my audio is good now too. Sorry I ever bought the thing!"
2,Need some disclaimers as stated in other reviews,"In this day of native DVI on most computers, it would make sense to disclaim that this device does not work with DVI-RGB adapters. I have one computer with RGB, and one with DVI only. The second computer is older than the first. Also, if you don't have a Scroll Lock button on your keyboard, forget this device.I got it to work, but the monitor on the DVI only computer blinked on and off periodically. I changed the monitor cable, and it does not blink anymore. However the video fan cycles on and off every few seconds, which is annoying. I think I will just have to throw this away, get a monitor for the other computer, and cut my losses.I was also using a modern backlit keyboard that does not have a scroll lock button, but the hot key switching did not work to change to a ctrl ctrl sequence to cycle the monitors. So I am using the cheap keyboard that came with the oldest computer now in order to cycle between computers."
2,Good but not good enough,"Works like it's suppose to, but the monitor turns off every 30-seconds (Goes black) on either computer. So maybe just I had a bad unit idk, another thing i seen is you have to make sure the USB's are plugged into the right sides of unit to make keyboard work. First time i hooked it up nothing would work. I'm returning it gonna get different model and try that one hope that one works better!"
4,simplicity itself,"Easy to follow instructions and no difficulty setting this up. Connected a new-ish dell tower and an old-ish dell laptop and worked fine. Once had the laptop revert to a smaller screen resolution, but only once. Can't fault it. Cheap too (though that just might be the exchange rate talking) and very quickly delivered."
3,"good compact usb solution, problems with docking station","i was using this at my previous job with a dell inspiron laptop & dell precision workstation. the display part worked but the keyboard & mouse part did not work from the laptop side. apparently this is because it was connected to the laptop through the dell docking station, & the power supply from the docking station usb port was not sufficient. some of my colleagues had newer laptops with side-usb & they were able to use it when plugged in directly to the laptop (mine had only rear-usb, so i can't plug in anything when its in the dock)."
4,I have several of these working fine,"This switch has been working fine for us. We do not use the audio at all though, which appears to be the biggest complaint.I've been using the PS2 version of this for a while now. The new systems I have been buying don't have PS2 ports so I had to find some new KVM's. I currently have about six of these in production and haven't received any complaints from the users.That's good enough for me to buy some more when the need arises."
2,"Buggy, crappy, reboot-craving piece of junk","Works for a limited amount of time then starts acting up. I've had two of these for two different computers and they experience the same problems. Sometimes when you switch over, the mouse simply hangs. It's not a wireless mouse...just a standard USB laser mouse. However, many times I have to unplug the mouse from the KVM and plug it into the computer to get it to recognize. The keyboard always switches over and I haven't had a problem with it. However, the sound sometimes gets splices...instead of switching the audio it will combine them. Stay away from this product! It will cause you no end of headaches!"
4,Does its job well,Other than a slight problem with installation until my computers recognized the keyboard and mouse this unit works extremely well. I particularly like the ability to change the switch keystroke to the Ctrl key which makes finding and using the switch easier.
5,Docking Station substitute,"Bought it to share my keyboard and mouse between my PC and Laptop. One USB plug into the laptop allows me to control it using the same keyboard and mouse as for my PC. Just push the scroll lock button twice to switch control between computers. Can share the monitor as well, which is great if you want to use both at the same time. Just plug in the power, and it replaces a docking station at a fraction of the cost."
5,"Works perfectly, no problems on Linux too","I was a bit hesitant thinking of a key activated KVM switch would work fine on Linux too but it has been working just great out of the box on my Windows + Linux machines sharing the Monitor, keyboard, Wireless mouse, speakers and Webcam.No problem now for 6 months and more."
4,works with some keyboards,"Easy to set up, easy to operate.The multi-media keys work on my setup, however, music on one machine does not switch when going between machines, you get the sound on the current machine.I had one problem during installation. I had to unplug the USB on one PC & re-plug in order for Windows to recognize the mouse. I originally had a PS/2 mouse on that PC.Update to review: I upgraded the original Dell keyboard to a plain Unicomp keyboard. The IOgear KVM switch does not work with the new Unicomp keyboard, doesn't recognize it at all. I'd rate this one or two stars, not four as I originally reviewed."
2,USB KVM doesn't work with laptop port replicator,"I bought the product for use with my home desktop and my work laptop. I use a port replicator with the laptop and when I went to use the KVM, it woulld switch between PCs OK, the mouse would work but the keyboard would not. I contacted IOGEAR through their website and did get back an answer within 24 hours (forget trying to call, I went on death hold). Unfortunately, the answer was that the KVM would not work through a port replicator and that I had to hook up directly through the laptop. Disappointing because the replicator made life easier to turn the laptop on and off easier (don't have to open up the laptop). My low rating is only due to this fact, and I feel that this fact should be prominently displayed in the advertisement of the product as a warning."
2,Loses the keyboard every few days,Every few days I have to crawl under the desk and power cycle it (by unplugging from every computer's USB port) because the keyboard stops working (while mouse continues to function).
1,Right USB Port Dies,"Like some others, I found this device unreliable. The right-hand USB port ceased to work after about a week. Off to purchase something a little more ""industrial""."
3,New product - a little raw,"Not a full-featured USB switch. Only works with a keyboard and a mouse wich show up as a generic combo device under windows. The USB hub and the media buttons on my Dell USB keyboard don't work when connected through this switch.The audio switch is very noisy. There is even more noise when the computers are turned off. I had to start a new habit of turning off my speakers after I'm done working on the PC.The USB ports on the switch (where you plug you keyboard in) are rather loose. The cables occasionally fall out on their own.Apart from the complaints above, the switch performs its main function very well."
2,Not very good!,This does not work with cordless keyboards-mouse units.Also makes speakers sound bad.
1,it just didn't work,"The KVM switch was dead on arrival. I tried it with multiple keyboards - USB and PS/2 (with adapter), and multiple computers. It did not transfer any signals from the keyboard to the computer. The video of one computer was visible on the screen, but that's it. There was no keyboard or mouse functionality at all. After trying all of the troubleshooting ideas (such as removing other USB devices to increase power available to the KVM), I returned the item to Amazon."
2,Works well . . . when it works.,"We've been using the Iogear KVM switch for a couple weeks on a Mac Mini Core Duo running OS X 10.4.6 and a Mac G3 B&W Tower running OS 9.2.2. A couple times per day the keyboard (we've tried various) will cease to be recognized (although the mouse still works). In consequence, we can't trigger the KVM switching (we use CTRL-CTRL), and are stuck with having to either reboot (which usually fixes it for a while) or crawl under the desk and swap cables around for a direct connection bypassing the KVM. An online forum mentioned needing more power on the USB line, so I added a powered hub to the keyboard connection. No joy."
1,"Keyboard connection dies quickly, 2 out 2.","This switch uses keyboard combo command to switch between two computers. In my experience with 2 of these, both failed within a couple of days--the keyboard port was completely dead.Must be a systematic flaw somewhere from all the reports on this issue.Keyboard: MS Natural Ergonomic 4000Mouse: Logitech V200"
3,Simple and reliable with a caveat on audio...,"Right now I am a happy user of the GCS632U. Like alot of people point out, there are issues with the audio. Ignoring frequency response or audio quality, I found that if I have speakers hooked up to the KVM, the KVM itself locks up once or twice a day.On a whim I connected my speakers straight to an MP3 player one weekend and noticed the KVM wasn't having issues anymore. I have gone almost a week now without having to reset the KVM. So now I am happy with it. I was about to return it but since audio switching just isn't that important to me, I'll keep it.I use it with a Logitech MX1000 laser mouse and a Kinesis Advantage Pro USB keyboard. All of their functionalities work fine. No lag or weird mouse acceleration/deceleration.So I like the product. But for having a fairly significant bug with one of its fundamental features, I can only give it a 3 out of 5."
2,Does not work with the Microsoft Wireless Keyboard & Mouse.,I got this unit and it does not work with the Microsoft Wireless Keyboard & Mouse. The keyboard types only 50% of the time and the mouse does not work at all. But the video quality is very good. It would have been an ideal unit if the keyboard & mouse worked.
1,Will Not Work with Wireless KB or Mouse,"I agree with the reviews here, it does NOT work with wireless keyboard and mouse. It did not say that in the packaging. I am returning this to BestBuy. Terrible waste of my time."
2,Not working propertly - Don't use with docking station,"Video cut out randomly from time to time for several seconds. If, while using the first computer, the second computer entered power save mode, switching back to the second computer would not wake it up. Moving mouse or tapping on keyboard would not wake it up. Iogear says this product is not for use with docking stations - a 'feature' not advertized or noted on their product description. I have returned this product. Otherwise, the product worked well, good video quality, responsive hot key selection."
2,Apple Aluminum Keyboards tricky but possible.,"There are 3 different manuals all confusing that I found for this product. I will combine them here and simplify set up on an Apple aluminum keyboard.You have to hold Clear for a second then - for a second and release both at the same time. It take a few times before this will work. The caps lock key will start flashing which will indicate you are in ""invoke hotkey mode"". Now, the buttons that work in this mode are as follows:H this wil let you use CTRL F12 to get into this mode instead of Clear -.T will make the port switching actually work by pressing Ctrl Ctrl. (since there is no scroll-lock on mac keyboards.)R restores factory defaults. ( have to use Clear - to get to ""invoke hotkey mode""ESC to exit ""invoke hotkey mode"""
4,IOGear 2 port miniview,"Very easy to setup and use, just connect the cable to 2 computers with a usb keyboard and mouse and VGA monitor connection. Cables are not very long so the computers need to be pretty close. Was working in 5 minutes."
4,"Works only with traditional USB keyboards and mice, but is very useful anyway","This KVM will only work with vanilla USB devices, so no wireless combos or anything fancy should be tried. Anyway, installation was a breeze and, let's face it, the first reason to get a KVM in the first place is a lack of resources.The only problem I had is that I used a Benq FP93GW as the shared monitor, and while the Ubuntu box recognised the KVM as if I had never plugged out the thing, on Windows XP the driver rolled back to ""Default monitor"", which looks far below expectations. After around 2 weeks, Windows magically recognised the monitor, but I can't blame the KVM for this blunder.The $49.99 tag seems a bit steep for me, but at $29.99, you definitely get a good, reliable piece of hardware."
1,Full Mac Support--NOT,"Possibly a fine product unless you have a new Mac system with a 23 inch monitor. According to Iogear they don't support anything larger than 22 inches. Had someone posted this little tidbit before I ordered it (from MacMall, not amazon) I'd have spent a lot less time on hold."
3,"Works ok, but audio is unusable","The unit seems to work as advertised, except for the audio. I bought one and couldn't get anything but very underpowered and very tinny audio to come out of my speakers. The speakers worked fine plugged directly into a computer. I spoke with tech support and they said it must be a defective unit. I returned to the store and exchanged it for a new one and have the same exact results. Based on other reviews here I'm of the opinion that this thing cannot pass thru a quality audio signal. I sent another note to tech support asking for the audio specs. If I get them I'll update this review."
1,beware,"Worked fine for about 2 weeks, then the keyboard started randomly shutting off. Have to shut down and reboot both machines in order to get it working again."
1,Watch your back!,"***WARNING***This product is not for users with nForce Chipsets. I see users complaining that this product hangs and the keyboard acts up. You have an nForce chipset on your motherboard. If you are a fan of AMD and use their processors (hence a likely nForce chipset), stay away from this product, because IT WILL NOT WORK RIGHT!Aside from having to install a separate USB card to get it to work (which I cannot do for my laptop) it has performed quite well. I read many reviews about the audio quality, and I tend to agree. The audio will clip if I turn my PC volume up over the halfway mark. This is easily resolved by keeping the volume low and turning your powered speakers up.I would hesitate to buy another IOGear product in the future (without extensive compatability research before hand)."
2,Not Thrilled,This KVM switch worked for all of about 10 minutes before I started having problems with it. I have since replaced it with a larger KVM with more features. I refuse to sell this KVM because I don't want someone else inheriting the problems with this KVM.
2,Should be called KM switch,"I was very disappointed with this item. I have two machines at home that I like to switch between. The monitor I have is a 20"" Flat Panel Dell 16001200 resolution. While the KVM 'supports' this resolution I found that it added some ghosting artifacts. IOGear tech support's solution was to reduce the screen resolution. That worked, but why would I get such a nice monitor if I have to reduce the screen resolution to use it. Fortunately the monitor has an input for VGA video and DVI video that you can switch between on the monitor. So now I just run video directly to the monitor and when I need to switch I have to switch the KM and V separately. Also I found that the audio adds excessive noise and I have to manual move that connection if I want the change the audio.If you have a high resolution monitor, I'd suggest looking for a different product!"
5,Definitely Pleased,"As I began setting up my multi-PC system (need to connect to two different networks and the two may not communicate) I heard horror stories from people who had problems with their KVM switches. This Iogear switch installed without any trouble and has worked well for the last month. Additionally, its very small footprint makes it easy to keep out of the way (mine is velcroed to the bottom of my desk). I heartily recommend it."
4,Not bad for the price,"This switch does a good job, easy to toggle back and forth between my Mac and Windows PC by tapping Scroll Lock twice. Devices worked perfectly from the start. However, the main reason I chose this switch over the others was the audio. Unfortunately, the audio becomes VERY, VERY tinny when sent through the switch. If you're into good sound, and I mean not awful sound, don't go with this switch..otherwise, it is A+."
2,"This one is a dud, I own two others that work great","This is the third KVM from Iogear that I've purchased. I've got one at work and my wife is using the other. I've been using the one at work for 2+ years without any problems and I switch between computers at work dozens of times a day. I received this one last week, it's for my home setup. I've had problems with it since I've plugged it in the first time and I'll be asking for a replacement this week.As I sit and type this review the KVM switch drops the video signal out and the monitor goes blank and then comes back in. I was thinking that maybe it had to do with one of the computers I had plugged in so this is the third computer I've tried, still the same problem. I've swapped the cables b/n computers, same issue. This one must be a dud.Hopefully Amazon is gracious on getting a replacement."
2,"Bought 12/20/08, Died 8/15/11","This switch simply stopped working all of a sudden and went to the KVM Switch junkyard/heaven after only 2 years and 8 months. This stinks--bought it for $49.99 and it dies on me in less than 3 years...Just installed TrendNet TK-209K, and noticed that the picture quality is waaay...waaay better than with the deceased IOGear GCS632U (both TK-209K and GCS632U indicated resolution of up to 2048 x 1536)."
3,Not a real KVM,Poor mouse/keyboard response between PC's - my first USB KVM with a wireless keyboard combo. Not impressed at all. Loses connectivity frequently. Oh well...
5,Did exactly what I wanted.,"I bought this device to help me switch quickly between activity I want to do on my business and home computers on nights & weekends. When I'm at home, I like to multi-task by doing some personal things on my home computer (like listening to music or using gmail) at the same time that I do work on my business laptop. It was a pain to put both computers on my desk in my home-office and continually switch back and forth between them.Now, through a simple keyboard double-click action, this device quickly and easily lets me toggle which of my 2 computer video outputs gets displayed on my larger home monitor -- either my home computer or my business laptop. It also lets me use the same mouse+keyboard combo to interact with both computers.So it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do, and I am delighted."
4,Great product for the money,"I use it to switch between a Mac PowerBook G4 and a Dell Dimension. Monitor is a 20"" Dell LCD @ 1680 x 1050. I use a Mac keyboard, because I like the slim configuration. I had to download a Windows utility to remap a couple of keys for Windows. I also use the KVM to switch audio. I've configured the switching so that's it's triggered by tapping the control key.So far, almost everything works as advertised. Switching happens pretty cleanly.One minor glitch: occasionally when I switch to the Dell, the display won't work. I get an error message about ""on the monitor, ""Cannot display this mode"". Seems to happen when the Dell has gone into some power saver mode.Otherwise, it works fine. There are probably better KVMs out there, but they're more expensive. I would buy this again."
1,Problem Child w/Premature Death,"This item worked as advertised for the first 2 days and then died while in use. Efforts to revive it were futile. Returning it to Amazon. Considering the sucess I have had with other IOgear products this one is quite a surprise. Puchased a different brand that is powered- that one is fine. Not sure if the ""powered"" feature is significant or not but after reading alot of reviews of all KVM switches the self-powered ones seem to encounter more problems. Avoid this one."
2,Overprice piece of junk,"I bought this at BestBuy becasue i just purchased a mac and i still wanted to keep my old PC. It worked well on the mac but when i tried to use it for the PC it did not work. Don't even bother hooking your speakers up to it i could barely hear anything out of them. After trying to hook up the think and failing i just deicede that i would take it back and just get rid of my old PC. Can someone explain to me why this thing is $50 are it is, a bunch of wires and gadgets."
1,Dishonesty,"With IOGEAR MiniView Micro KVM switches such as GCS632U and GCS52U, you will lose function of the extra keys or buttons on your mouse and keyboard. And yet, you will have to try one to find out."
2,Does not work with wireless keyboards,"The emulated KVM won't allow the switch to happen with wireless keyboard/mice hotkeys.The product quality itself is pretty good, but the description should state the issue w/ emulated kvm!"
1,Blanks Out- Crap Product,"Let me start by saying that this my be my first review i've ever written on Amazon. I've bought two of these, one from Best Buy (which I returned because of this issue) and one from Amazon. Each one blanks out after a few minutes and the screen will go blank. I will be calling for a replacement. The product is solid in its features but it's execution is absolutely horrible.I am very dissatisfied. I do not recommend buying this product, and if there is an alternative from another company, I would rather buy that instead."
2,"mediocre image quality, didn't work with Windows","I tried to use this to switch between a HP desktop running Linux and a small Acer Windows computer. The Linux machine works well, but Acer didn't get any keyboard input. I tried several different keyboards, I tried power cycling everything in different orders, nothing worked. Furthermore, although the device claims that it can handle higher resolutions, the screen was noticeably fuzzy already at 1920x1200.Altogether, altogether, I consider this device nearly useless. You may be able to switch between two Linux servers with it, but for its primary use--switching between two desktop machines--image quality and reliable operation with Windows are paramount.Sad, really, because physically, the device is nice and small, and the company spent some effort on making the device flexible and easy to program. If it worked better, it would be a great device."
1,Lousy Tech Support,"We are ""The Real McCoy Computer Service inc."" in Delaware.How dare these jerks keep us on the hold waiting for tech support for 15 minutes only to be transferred to a voice mail box.TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL. My time as Senior Technician is just as valuable as theirs.Now to see what they do about the problem with this device."
1,Does not work with Logitech Wave Keyboard,This product did not work because the HotKey does not exist on my keyboard. It is supposed to allow you to reprogram a new hot key. DID NOT WORK EITHER. Got frustrated and bought a different brand. This product should come with compatability guide.
2,had to return two,"I returned the first thinking it was broken, but the replacement had the same problem. When the computer (running vista) goes to sleep it looses the mouse. I had to reboot to find the mouse. I will not buy again."
2,Fail,I have purchased 2 of these units. Both of them have a problem where the monitor goes blank for 5 or so seconds every few minutes. It doesn't matter what computers are attached to this switch I still have this problem and BOTH switches do this. If I connect the monitor directly to the computer the issue goes away. It's very annoying.
5,"Easy to setup, easy to use.","I needed a KVM switch to change between a Macbook and an IBM laptop. This worked almost perfectly and I am very happy with it. I set this KVM switch up in a few minutes and haven't read the instructions yet. I had read in a review before purchasing that it used the scroll lock key to switch and that was all I needed to know.I don't need sound, although it would occasionally come in handy, the IBM laptop has the headphone jack on the opposite side of the monitor and usb cables so the KVM sound cable won't reach it. I haven't tried an extension cable yet, because it doesn't mean that much to me.I'm not fond of the monitor connectors, they are a little difficult to screw in/unscrew. This is an annoyance to me because I use a laptop, so I have to unscrew/screw them in all the time. This isn't an issue on the macbook because I use a display port to/VGA adapter with it.I am happy I purchased it and would purchase it again."
2,Poor Image Quality,"Returned it because the video image quality was poor on one of my PCs. I could not get the same image quality using the KVM, compared with straight cable, even after updating all drivers. IOGear customer support could not resolve the problem either and recommended returning it for another unit. The problem may be with my video card or hardware, but my old PS-2 Linksys KVM did not have any problems with the same hardware. I switched back to my old PS-2 Linksys KVM, with excellent image quality, until I find a USB KVM that works with my hardware."
5,Great!!,"I bought this to so i could hook up two computer towers to one set of keyboard, mouse and monitor. Easy to set up and use. Just tap one button twice and it toggles between the two computers. Buying it on Amazon saved me $20 from the store price. All around it's a great product and a great price. Free shipping was also a nice bonus and arrived in a reasonable time."
3,You get what you pay for...,"Nice product for basic usage - if you keep the setup simple the product should work nicely for you. If you need it to do more in a more complicated setup this may not be the product you're looking for - like anything you get what you pay for. Simple setup, simple operation, but like other home user level KVM you can get stuck in screens and not be able to exit until that process is complete, it would have been nice for a manual button in those instances."
4,good usb kvm,"i have a linux desktop and a windows laptop with one LCD screen, one usb keyboard and a usb mouse.So i got this one and it has been working great always, simple way to switch between machines and has an led indicator to know whats active.Sometimes i gets hanged (happened about 3 times over 4 months) and i am not sure if its because of my linux desktop, things seem to work fuzzy with linux at times, otherwise no complains"
4,Worked without too much trouble in setup,"I just bought an eMachines for a cheapie PC to work alongside my trusty G5. I had virtual PC but it rna like molasses. With Vista preinstalled on the eMachines, I'm a little worried about the speed, too.At first the switch didn't work, because I still had my Mac mouse attached to the keyboard instead of in the right port on the switch, after i changed that, it all worked smoothly. I agree that the audio is really poor. so I removed the speakers from the jack on the switch. But, overall so far so good. I hope it lasts. ; )"
3,"Adequate, but not great","Overall the device worked alright with my two systems (Mac G4 & Macbook Pro), but I had some problems with the delete key not working and I couldn't get it fixed. I decided that it wasn't enough of a necessity for me at the moment, so I returned it. I think this is something you really need to invest in. Personally I'd prefer a manual switch to go from one machine to the next, and if it doesn't support ALL functionality, then it's really not worth it in my book."
1,Not compatible w G5 mac,The HotSwitch is pretty fussy. Certain key commands are not mapped (the command zapping PRAM for instance). I returned it for a hardware physical kvm switch. I'm very happy I did.
1,"Needs A ""DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE"" Warning Label","My past history with IOGear products has been very good - reliable, accurately represented, usually adequately described pieces of equipment. This KVM switch doesn't meet any of those expectations.There are so many brands and types of KVM switches available that I think a user advanced enough to want one would be happier with almost any other.Someone who is trying to iron out wrinkles in a second computer doesn't need the distraction of FIRST needing to fiddle with the KVM for proper operation. KVM switches are typically fairly straight forward - this one is a little hinkey and just not worth the hassles.While A clearer & more concise product description would help and guide user expectations, I suggest a strongly worded warning label would be better."
1,Doesnt work with keyboards with caccard readers,"Don't buy it if you use a cacreader in your keyboard, it will not work tryed two neither worked correctly"
1,Agree with Cathy Goodwin,"I agree with Cathy Goodwin's observations about the shortcomings of this book. I simply couldn't relate to the women profiled and their comfortable lives. In fact, I found it all rather depressing. IMO, people who are financially well-off just don't seem to realize just how much having money gives them opportunities, choices and comforts that less well-off people will never have. Maybe Ms Goodwin should write a book for the rest of us!"
3,"Stories, not a guide","I was somewhat disappointed in IF NOT NOW, WHEN? I suppose some folks may find this type of story-telling helpful. But, for me, it was too much story and not enough how-to. I was hoping, and expecting, some type of guide on how to get to what's next in this the second half of my life. It did not give any concrete instruction. If you are looking for a book that gets your heart racing and thinking about what you have to look forward to, and what you can do to get there, read WHAT'S NEXT: WOMEN REDEFINING THEIR DREAMS IN THE PRIME OF LIFE."
3,"Strange, lopsided book!","What a strange, lopsided book this is! Intended as a description of SF TV shows of the 1950s, it devotes 60 pages to ""Adventures of Superman,"" hardly SF though the main character is from another planet! But the really important programs get from about 10 pages (""Space Patrol"" and ""Tom Corbett Space Cadet"") to less than one! The seminal ""Captain Video"" gets only 6 pages. There is a bit of info here I haven't seen elsewhere and most of the info is accurate, but at the price, only libaries are going to be buying this. You don't need it."
3,could be better,"i like the idea of a spork for regular dining, but all the ones i see are the lightweight camping titanium kind. i was hoping for a more common type here. it would be good, but the tines are only a little short. the problem is the can opener. it makes holding the spork uncomfortable for no reason at all. whose idea was it to make it a swiss army knife. close, but nogo."
3,Stabby,"The scork is very stabby. It is so sharp I've cut myself multiple times on the tines when washing it, luckily not when eating.... yet. Otherwise its a perfectly good spork, but for this reason alone I don't recommend it. The can opener part is sharp too, but I have not lacerated myself with it.... so far."
3,"Too much, talk, too boring","I have read all Desiree Shapiro books by Selma and each one gets worse. I was hoping that by reading another one it would keep my interest but... I don't care what Desiree looks like or if she is plump or etc., she cannot keep a thought by which you can follow what is happening after a murder has been committed and Desiree is hired to solve it. How does she have time to solve anything when her life is in turmoil and her co-worker, niece and the neighbors are running (ruining) her life. There doesn't seem to be any story line to follow and after about 25 pages you just give up and get rid of the book. I kept hoping the stories would change but they didn't."
1,This book can upset your brain,Usually I love Desiree Shapiro and the methods she uses to solve a crime but this book seemed unorganized and I found myself not even caring what the outcome was. There were side stories about Ellen picking out a wedding dress and somebody giving a party but this was not one of Selma Eichler's best.Don't waste your time.
4,"$25.19, pleasant and fragrant",I recommend this moisturizer based on my experience with it and based upon the natural ingredients. The ingredients encourage me to slather it on.
3,Inside the Tale of the Fox -The Eric Carr Story.,Even if a Casual fan the documentary sheds light on a important member of the band and his life story.Interesting and worth watching.
4,"For sleeping yes, for spanish no","This album is beautiful and should certainly put your little one to sleep. Many of the songs have a kind of aching lonliness, and the musicianship is spectacular. Two cautions:1) How many versions of Duerme Negrita can they put on one album? Aren't there other songs Cuban mamas y papas sing to their little ones?2) If you're hoping to introduce your little one to the Spanish language, quite a few of these songs are in afro-cuban dialect.Enjoy!"
4,"Enjoyable to listen to, but not for putting kids to sleep.","Our whole family loves listening to this CD. However, as you might be able to tell from the product description, the music starts off softly lulling children to sleep and then picks up the beat and volume in the later part. So, just when my kids were starting to relax-they suddenly felt like dancing. We solved the problem by using the feature on our CD player which allows us to pre-program only the songs we want for bedtime. Really a nice collection of songs."
5,A Joy,I feel like a great parent when I expose my kids to the great music available on this planet. Great for bedtime.
2,No spare parts,"I needed another bread pan for the machine, and when I called the Mfr, they said they don't make the bread pan. I asked if it was because it was an older model, they said no. So,if anything breaks, you pretty much need to buy a new bread machine."
2,Dont chose this one,"I read all the customer feedback. Sinse there were some good reviews, I dedided to buy it. Big mistake. The bread pan pops up during kneading, just as the other reviews stated. Please chose another bread machine. I bought because the price was right, and I liked the features. Please, just dont buy this machine, unless you want to sit beside it the entire cycle."
4,Breadman TR2500BC Review,"This is an excelent breadmaker. I have made several loaves so far and they have turned out well. I use the breadmaker as I am intolerant to wheat and make wheat free bread. It took me a couple of tries to get the baking right but it works really well now. The receipe feature was a big help. I also really like that the bread just falls out of the pan. My only concern is the pan looks a bit flimsy but it works well so far, I'll see over time how it holds up."
4,bread maker,rapid delivery / machine does everything it was suppose to do / makes very large perfect sized loaves bread / i would buy one again
4,breadmaker,"This product is good for giving a perfect loaf of bread.It mixes well,better than the other breadmakers I had.The mixing process is a little noisy but it is well worth it."
3,Wife LOVED it.....had to return it,"My wife LOVED the machine. In the few weeks of owning it, it was FANTASTIC. The quality of the bread was second to none. However, after about three loaves, we noticed that a seal at the bottom of the bread pan, was beginning to corrode. I had purchased the ""used-like new"" model. It was definitely NOT like new. A few of the accessories were broken. We returned it but we WILL be ordering the same make/model again, from a different merchant (we initially ordered from Warehouse Deals). As long as the hardware is good, we will LOVE the machine."
1,"Good at FIRST, Does not last","I've owned two Breadman machines. I've had trouble with the belt system on both. The first tore up in about a month. The second lasted about three years and both made less than 50 loaves of bread. On top of that, the machine I have is no longer supported and you cannot even by belts for it. Seems that a company that intends for their product to last would continue to produce belts and parts. My machine is about 3 or so years old. It would work fine if I could get the belt to stay on. I'm trying to find a new source for the belt. Guess there is very little chance it is a common belt.I'd really try another brand. Currently I'm using a Kitchenaid Mixer. All I had to do was activate the yeast first and add it with the water instead of last. All my bread machine recipies work fine with the mixer and oven. You really have to get the bread kneeded so watch a few youtube videos."
4,Good Breadmaker,"does its job, did not encounter any issue other than the fact that it dances a little on the counter."
4,look what I bought MOM,"well since I have gotten it I have been in the hosp andvery sick,,,, it looks good, I bought it from recomenndation of my Daughter in law and have tasted the bread.."
1,breadman TR2500BC,"I bought this machine a few years ago. I should have returned it, but I have NEVER baked a good loaf of bread! They are all undercooked, doughy in the middle and hardly browned. I bought it to make my gluten free bread but I have also tried it on wheat bread for my husband. Again...never turned out a fully cooked loaf."
2,Breadman,This is my 3rd Breadman bread machine and so far from this TR2500BC have not had a nice loaf come out.
2,This machine has some specific design flaws,"We read the reviews for this breadmaker and were a little apprehensive about buying it, but ended up deciding to take the chance, hoping that most of the people who had reviewed it simply hadn't used the machine correctly. Unfortunately, the machine we received had some design flaws. Each time we used it, the pan would walk it's way up and out of the clips that hold it in the bottom of the oven, especially during the knead cycles. Eventually, the pan would pop up and out completely, so the driver would not contact the paddle, and no more mixing or kneading would take place. If we noticed the problem, we would press the pan back into place, and it would mix/knead again for a little while. However, opening the lid releases a lot of heat, and whenever we did this, the resulting loaf would be about half size and very dense. I recommend buying a more expensive breadmaker. You get what you pay for."
1,completely disappointing,i had a breadman bread machine several years ago which was damaged in a move. i decided to get a new one and selected this model. the unit never cooked a loaf properly. i tried several recipes and variations to make sure it wasn't an issue with the recipe itself. no luck. it would cook the top and bottom of the loaf but the center would be raw. i ended up having to send it back and replaced it with a different model. same thing happened. spend the extra $ and get a zojirushi.
1,Breadman,"I do not need a machine that will make anything more than one or two loaves of wheat or white bread weekly. Unfortunatey, this Breadman was not that machine. Soon after purchase, the bread pan began to jump out of its holding during the knead cycles (using the recipes and ingredients shown in the book that accompanied the machine). The whole machine would also jump across the counter and had to be constantly watched to prevent it from falling. The paddle would also work its way off the holder and embed itself in the dough. After pausing the machine, fishing out the paddle, replacing it, and restarting the machine 5 times for a single loaf of bread, I gave up and purchased a machine from a different manufacturer, and it has worked fine."
2,Cheap non-stick surfaces,"The machine itself works fine and I really don't have any complaints about the way it works. However, both the paddle and the tub are made of extraordinarily cheap teflon or somesuch non-stick material. We had to replace the paddle after only a few weeks because it got scratched. Although we were upset about it, we figured that it was possible that it dropped or was hit by something in the drying tray. But now the tub is badly scratched and the very thin teflon film is coming off. Since teflon is potentially cancer-causing, this also has to be replaced - and Breadman charge a fortune for shipping.Also, Breadman's customer service is terrible. It took them 3 weeks to respond to an email!I'd say look around for something else."
1,It was Great! (for 10 seconds),"The Breadman has a lot features versus price. I have 30+ years of bread baking experience, 16 years with a bread machine; I'm not a newbie.I'd read reviews where the pan was a problem, so after putting all of my ingredients into it, I made sure it was secured as tightly as possible. The machine started after the delay that I set. Although loud, it wounded normal for all of 10 seconds. Suddenly, it started shaking and banging, making a noise similar to a washer with an out of balance load. I quickly unplugged the machine and opened the lid. The pan had completely jumped out of the clamps. I immediately repacked the machine and sent it back to Amazon.I bought theZojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine. Since the day I received the Zo, I've been averaging 3 loaves of bread every day. They come out wonderful, the machine is very quiet and best of all, the pan stays in place!"
3,Good...at first,"My last machine was a breadman TR2200 and it lasted almost 5 yrs. We do not buy bread at the store at all (mainly due to food allergies) so we were making at least 2 or 3 loaves each week. When it quit we bought the breadman TR2500BC. At first I hated it for a number of reasons. It was harder to get the pan in 'just right'. It is impossible to see the lcd so I had to pull the machine closer to the edge of the counter, set it, and push it back. The size and shape of the loaf didn't really fit in my slicing gadget (the old loaves did). But it made pretty good bread and I got used to all that. Well after just 18 months this machine has now died. I can't believe it lasted less than a third of the time the old one did. I am in the market for a new machine-I don't want to buy another Breadman now and I don't really want to spend $200 on a Zojirushi."
2,Poorly made bread pan,"The bread pan is flimsy and did not stay in place.If one is willing to re-seat the pan several times it makes a good loaf of bread. Not willing to do that every time I returned it the morning after I bought it.I think the pan and clips are under engineered for the job. Probably there are other places inside that are equally flimsy, if the things you see and touch are. My old Oster used similar, but much larger/heavier clips to hold a much more substantial pan. The idea is fine.I'm used to looking in on a bread machine during the first stir, to scrape the sides with a rubber spatula, to add a little water or flour.However going to look every time the motor runs to make sure the clips haven't come loose is beyond my patience. Do yourself a favor and buy one that's better made. Or plan on watching it."
4,Great Breadmaker!,"Since receiving this breadmaker I have used it four times with both packaged mixes and bread from scratch. So far I have been very happy with the outcome. The only suggestion I have is to make sure the pan is securely fastened in before you start. The second time I used it, the pan came loose during the kneading cycle. I was able to get it back in and finish the cycle, but you just have to be careful with it. This is the only reason I didn't give it five stars. This replaces another Breadman I had for about ten years. They are good products."
1,"Unfortunately, I got a Dud","I just got this machine and went to break it in, per the manufacturers instructions. Before baking bread, you have to run the machine on a bake cycle while empty in order to burn off the manufacturing oils. It went through the motions of kneeding and baking beautifully. I let it cool down to room temperature and then proceeded to assemble the ingredients for my first bread recipe. When I plugged in the machine and turned it on nothing happened. The display would not even come on! It appears to have burned itself out on the very first use. :( I ended up making my bread the old fashioned way. My friend who has the same machine but different model (TR220C) swears by his and has been using it at least twice a week for year. Maybe I just got the lemon of the bunch?!"
4,Works well for Gluten Free breads,"I was given one of these machines for Christmas and am so pleased that I am buying one for my niece. We make only gluten free bread, which is significantly different than ""regular"" so I don't know about other reviews stating problems - perhaps there is a lot of unit to unit variability. We have had a couple loaves fail but, in general, get far better bread than we are able to make by mixing and baking in the oven. We figured out that with the cost of gluten-free bread from local stores is so expensive (fresh made is even more expensive than the horrid frozen loaves that grocery stores sell) that by making our own the payoff time for making our own is less than 6 months at a loaf a week!"
1,Substandard Quality Control,"If this were an automobile review I would comment that the fit and finish were poor. Unfortunately the quality control of this product is such that the machine died after only four loaves of bread were made. I have had other bread makers including Breadman brands and quite frankly, do not understand how this company tolerates such inferior manufacturing standards for this item--it has the potential to reflect poorly on ALL items sold under this brand and possibly all brands of it's parent company, Salton."
4,Bread Machine Reliability,"Overall I am quite happy with the machine. I particularly like the variety of receipes provided. The user directions are easy to follow. The only problem I have experienced is that on two occasions the machine would not power up when I plugged it in. That resulted in the machine being loaded with ingredients and the inability to start the cycle. The problem was not a result of the cool down requirement since the machine had not been used for several days. Now, just to be sure, I plug the machine in to see if the ""beep"" occurs indicating the machine is ready to use."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus breadmaker and it is the poorest quality machine I have ever owned (and I have owned several other Brand breadmachines). The pan does not fit in the machine snugly and wiggles around sounding like it is going to come loose. The kneading paddle fits very loose and had a LOT of slack around the shaft and it jumps up and down when it is kneading the dough. I have call the Breadman company and they sent me a replacement kneading paddle and it does not fit any better than the first one. They are supposed to send me another pan for it, but have not. I am VERY dissatisfied with this bread maker and will NEVER buy another Breadman brand product."
5,Can't Make a Bad Loaf with this Machine!,"I've owned at least five bread machines in the past 40 years, and this one is hands-down the best. With other machines, i found there were usually 2-3 bread recipes i could make and know they were turn out predictably OK. But when i'd try something new, the results were usually disappointing.Even though we've had this one only a couples month, but have tried at least six new recipes and every single loaf has been looked and tasted like a loaf of bread from a bakery. The crust is perfect (some other machines i've had made the crust too thick) and egg-shell thin which we like. The loaves rise tall every time.SO IMPRESSED with this machine; Just can't make a bad loaf with it!Dec 2012 update: this was a great unit, while it worked. But after a few months it just didn't work right. I wasted ingredients for 4-5 loaves, thinking it was surely something I was doing wrong. It wasn't. I finally gave up, pitched it, and bought a Zugrushi machine."
4,Love this breadmaker,I bake gluten-free bread atleast twice a week. This unit has made this necessary task very easy and very tasty. Would recommend this unit to anyone who likes fresh baked bread.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I got this machine yesterday, and am returning it to Amazon today! I made one loaf yesterday, and it came out alright. Then, I tried to make another loaf today and when I plugged in the machine, nothing happened. The machine would not turn on, and I tried it in 4 different outlets in different rooms. I had the TR200C for 3+ years before I decided to give that one to my mom and get this one. BIG MISTAKE! But, I did read the bad reviews before ordering, so I was prepared. I decided to press my luck, and it didn't work out for me.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MACHINE UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO DEAL WITH THE RETURN PROCESS!!!I am just thankful that it died before the 30 days was up so I don't have to deal with Salton!"
2,Can't get parts,"Decent enough bread. However, we lost the mixing paddle from a newer machine, purchased a few months ago, and so far all we have been told is that the part is on backorder. For six weeks. We called the phone number for replacement and should have realized that being given no ""order number"" was bad news. And we've paid for the part already."
4,Good machine,I have owned several brands of bread machines in the past. I rank this one as the best of the lot. I bought this one as a backup to an identical machine that is two years old. Eventually every appliance wears out and I do not want to be without my favorite.I fabricated a large hopper for adding up to 1/2 pound of raisins for raisin bread. I think it is a worthwhile improvement.
4,Bread machine,It seems to be working just fine. I have a couple of things that I have not figured out yet.
1,"Flimsy flanges allow pan to jump ""off the track""","I bought this model for friends, and showed them how to use it. Halfway through the mixing cycle it started making loud noises; I looked inside and it looked OK, but when the bread was done it became obvious that the inner pan had ""jumped"" out of position with the gear, and was lying about 40 degrees askew. We set up another loaf, and they report the same thing happened. I noticed that all that holds the pan in place is two straight flanges of metal that go over two small flanges on the pan. When I got home I looked at our TR875 model and noticed that it has much more robust, curved flanges with openings inside for the bread pan components. What a penny-wise and pound-foolish design flaw! I have now ordered the TR875 model for our friends and will return the TR2500BC."
1,Don't waste your money,"Broke after 6 months. I opened the lid and it fell off because the plastic hinge had separated. My father also bought one at the same time, but his lasted only 3 months (pan began popping out during kneading cycle). I bought the cheapest bread maker and I got the cheapest bread maker. Now I have to buy another. This next time around I'll buy either a Panasonic or a Zojirushi. Should have bought a Japanese model to begin with."
1,Breadman TR2500BC,I purchased this breadmaker thinking it had all the features that one could want. BUT...I can't leave it unattended because the pan pops out some of the time. I called their customer service and they said to spread the flour out evenly in the pan and pull up on the clips that keep the pan in the breadmaker before you but the pan in. I have done both and sometimes it works and sometimes the pan still pops out. Not sure it doesn't work All of the time. Bottom line is if you want to use it unattended this probably isn't the one for you. I will say that when it works it works great but I prefer better odds. I want a breadmaker that works 100% of the time! My advice would be to pick another one.
1,No unattended operation,"I'm rather disappointed with the Breadman. I bought it on the claim that it is a fully automatic, restaurant-quality bread maker, and it is definitely not that. It doesn't mix the dough properly without attention or help. When I leave it to bake by itself there are always unmixed clumps of raw flour in the end product, which is never quite a bread. It is also rather loud and several of the included recipes need adjustments to work properly. I'm not at a high elevation or use non-standard ingredients or measures, so I don't understand why they wouldn't work. I still use it to make bread, but it is not as care free as claimed."
1,Horrible,"This bread maker is a perfect example of very poor engineering. I did some research and found entries om line that went back to 2006 where there were complaints of the pan jumping up off the drive during the kneading process. Also besides being dissapointed in Breadman, I am also dissapointed in Amazon.com. Several of the comments I found were that the same Tr2500bc bought through them had the very same complaint and Amazon was not very cooperative. One instance it took 6 months for a buyer to get a refund. My feeling is if Amazon knew there was a problem with this machine why did they cotinue to sell it on their website. Shame om Breadman and on Amazon........"
1,Breadman has horrible customer service,"I have had this bread maker for about 9 months. It has popped out of place several times, but today it wouldn't stay in place at all. The customer service rep at Breadman though very nice said I would have to pay to have it returned to their company! Nice one year warranty that is! This things is heavy, I don't want to pay $20 (or more) for shipping on a unit that hasn't worked a whole year! Save your money people!"
2,"Flawed design, pan pops out; does not do one lb loaves well. too bad!!","Like the other reviewers who suffered the pan problem, I called the company. They very nicely told me to get a pair of pliers and adjust the clips. OK for a month, and then the pan just wouldn't stay in. I had to bake it in the oven. Also, while it advertises one lb. loaves, the manual says you have to keep adjusting the dough ball -- and you do! Otherwise, this is a great machine if you like to adjust things. It's all programmable -- you can change any part of any cycle. (OK. It's a guy thing.)"
3,Swede,"The Breadman TR2500BC bakes a good loaf of bread. It replaces an older model that was beginning to leak - (that non-replaceable washer that wears out long before the machine itself is worn out!) The TR2500BC still needs lots of attention to be sure that you don't end up with a lopsided loaf. I've made about a dozen loaves of bread with the new Breadman and every last one would have been lopsided had I not taken the dough out, reshaped it, and put it where it belongs. I was disappointed to see that the add-in container has not been improved. The older model would dump half of the seeds or raisins down the side and not into the dough. Thumbs down on that feature! I can't see that the convection feature to brown the top of the loaf is an improvement. The color of my loaves are the same as with the old machine. It's very noisy! Probably because the outer case is metal instead of plastic. Like I said at the beginning: It does bake a good loaf of bread. Swede"
2,Pathetic,"Sometimes this machine will make a good loaf of bread, but sometimes it fails utterly. You have to keep a close eye on it as it bakes, or it comes out a complete disaster. Often the paddle will just spin in circles, making a hollow cavity in the loaf without kneading properly. I have to pull it out and knead by hand, then stick it back it. What's the point of a breadmaker, if you have to knead by hand? That's half the work! And it also means you can't trust it to run on a timer, so that's the second good reason to own the machine out the window. It don't think the inside gets warm enough, either, because the yeast does not rise as much as it should."
4,"So far, so good","Making bread in this machine was even easier than I thought. As a baking neophyte, I purchased this girl thinking that it would provoke a curiosity within me to pursue baking other concoctions. It's had the opposite effect. I feel like a first class passenger peacefully resting while my pilot delivers me to my vacation playground. All I had to do was check in, walk through the terminal and conform to my seat. Assuming that you can properly measure ingredients and read an instruction manual, I don't see how this machine will disappoint. Since purchasing this last month we have cranked out 10 loaves, 3 pizza crusts and it has consistently performed flawlessy each time. Only improvement that I would urge, would be to make the bread pan longer than what is provided. If your aim is for easy, no-fuss baking then buy yourself one of these."
3,what a suprise,"My last Breadman was a vertical, much better. On second use It stopped kneading. The nut came off from the pulley. When advising Breadman They seamed not to care. For the price you expect better quality."
1,Horrible item! Do not buy!,"I received this item as a Christmas gift, and I wish my family had listened to all the negative reviews of this product. I attempted to bake a loaf of basic white bread, and the kneading paddle popped off during one of the kneading cycles. I failed to notice it, so I had to dig the paddle out of the ""finished"" loaf of bread. By ""finished"" I mean the bread was cooked on the bottom and raw on the top...which is probably because the bread pan popped out during the last cycle (which I also failed to notice). If you like paperweights that make paperweights, then this item is for you! If you want a breadmaker that makes bread, do not buy this item. I'm waiting for a refund for this item so I can try my luck with another one (not by Breadman) and hope I have better results."
1,Problem and no customer support,"I bought a new Breadman TR2500BC bread maker and used it to bake five or six loaves. At least three times, the kneading paddle came off the shaft during the kneading process and worked its way toward one end of the loaf, resulting in ruined bread. The paddle does not seem to fit on the drive shaft as tightly as it should. If I place the paddle on the shaft, pushing it on firmly, and then hold the otherwise empty bread pan upside down and shake it lightly, the paddle drops off the shaft. I tried unsuccessfully to send an e-mail to the address given in the instruction manual, but my server said it was not deliverable. I then mailed a letter to the Consumer Relations Department, also at an address shown in the manual. That was a month and a half ago. I've received no reply."
1,Lousy machine,"I bought this machine today due to the reviews. Don't waste your money. It wouldn't even heat up. Timer beeped it was done, I opened it up to a blob of dough. Took it back this evening. Customer service wasn't surprised at the return."
3,Needs a better recipe.,"So far the machine itself behaves as I think it should. Never having baked bread before, this is an assumption. My problem is that I have made four different loaves from the recipes provided with completely new and fresh ingredients, but all turned out to be dense and kind of flavourless. I did follow the recipes as written. Are there better recipes to use? I even tried one of those boxed recipes and got the same result. I want my bread lighter and airy. I saw the troubleshooting so when I get the courage back up I'll try another loaf and add extra water to see if that helps. So far so bland for now though."
5,"worked well, good value for money","i found the machine cheaper locally, and despite the poor reviews i got it.i have had no problem with it.i needed a bread machine because i have some old flour stored for about 5 years and kneading became dificult.now i dont have to throw out 100 lbs of flour and this machine did the job."
2,Good for 2 months and 10 loaves,"After 2 months of pain-free use and 10-15 loaves of bread, my machine ""died"" unexpectedly and I lost ingredients and my security in the product. I had made my first loaf of gluten-free bread for a gift and was going to make a cinnamon-raisin loaf for another gift. Loaded up the pan, plugged in the machine, and NOTHING happenend. Today I am going to Linens n Things where I bought it to see if the store will exchange for a new one. I did not want to buy this model with no reviews, but the 2200 was unavailable and apparently out of production. I am sobbing... Will let you know what Linen n Things does!Mary in Jupiter, FRL"
3,Breadman TR2500BC,"I was not too pleased with this item. The settings and dials are hard to manipulate if you want anything but a standard loaf of bread. It does make a nice 2 lb. loaf of regular white bread, but it is hard to make anything over and above that.Most disconcerting was the coupon inside for free yeast. It expired in December 2007 and I wonder how long this machine had been sitting around.I would not choose this item again."
1,Bad experience,"Bread pan would not stay in place when dough was kneading unless I stood and held it in place. Tryed to adjust it but didn't help. The instruction book said not to return to seller. But when I called the toll free number they were little help and told me to return it, so I did."
2,Poorly Designed and Does not have a powerful enough motor,"I've owned this machine for 1 1/2 years. At first, the machine made nice, white loaves. When I started to venture to new recipes, my Breadman started to fail. Heavier, whole wheat loaves are too much for the motor. My Breadman frequently stalls during the Knead 2 cycle. Other times, the entire pan pops out of its clips and I have to unplug the machine to re-insert the baking pan. To make a loaf of bread, I often have to hold the baking pan down during the entire Knead 2 cycle to avoid the loaf pan popping out of the clips.Once this machine dies, I will purchase a Zojirushi."
1,Worst bread machine I've owned,"The pan in this machine almost immediately stopped fitting into the machine properly. We ""fixed"" it with a pair of pliers, time after time, as mentioned in some of the reviews. Now the paddle has stopped working and falls off. Too many loaves of ruined bread...it's now in the garbage."
2,Cooks well but disappointed overall,"Initially I loved this bread machine. I could set up the recipe I wanted to make and walk off. It was noisy during the kneading cycle but that didn't last too long, and the bread it turned out was great. (The trick is to get the water at the right temperature). After using it frequently, however, the pan has started jumping during the kneading process over and over. I can't seem to get the pan pushed down far enough to get it over the clip rings on the sides despite pushing as hard as I can, so the pan just jumps around. I wind up standing next to the machine and holding the pan in the machine while it's kneading. After the kneading cycle is over I can lower the lid and walk off and it bakes the bread well. But this problem is extremely irritating. My husband loves the various breads so much that I'm giving up on this thing and ordering a new bread machine."
1,Broke after 34 days,Item no longer functioned after 34 days. At first I thought that it was not receiving power but the interior light still lit. Amazon refused to help since it had been more than 30 days. The customer relations for the breadmaker and sent me a return shipping label for old item and sent me a new machine. Glad to see that they stand behind their items.
2,Bread Pan Stuck in the Machine after First Use,"The bread machine arrived after 2 days. Upon arrival it had some imfections/indentations on the surface, to the extent that you wouldn't get it if it sits at a regular store. I was excited and went ahead to use it anyway. I ran an empty cycle first as the manual suggested, and everything was fine. I then made my very first bread, which turned out ok. But the bread pan got stuck inside the machine. My husband and I tried everything to take it out, and weren't able to. It's too bad because we can't even wash the pan now. It will go back to Amazon now."
3,Wish all the buttons would have worked,"I ordered this bread machine because it wasn't too pricy and wasn't too cheap. Reviews were mostly good and it had a gluten free setting, which is my main reason for buying a bread machine. After getting it, I immediately made a loaf of bread. The bread itself was good...a little under cooked after following the instructions, so I needed to add more time...but good. My main complaint is that the ""pause"" and ""stop/reset"" buttons just didn't work...AT ALL! The instructions claim you can pause at any point in any cycle...not so. And after starting the GF cycle for my second loaf, I wanted to reset it and try the rapid cycle instead, but couldn't do it. The buttons just didn't work. I am thankful that returning it is not going to be a problem or hassle. Looking for a new bread machine..."
4,Works,"I have used this unit a couple of times, and it has worked ok. I made gluten free bread, but had to use a normal cycle to get a second rise, albeit, I might not have programmed it correctly.The only complaint, is that the label on top, indicating the mode to use, was/is bubbled up and not neat looking. This is my second unit, as the first arrived dented due to poor packiing. However it too had a label that bubbled up. Not very good from a manufacturing point (should not be shipped with this problem)."
5,Fresh Bread At Last,Purchased this bread maker for my wife at the recommendation of a friend. Works great and I'm reaping the rewards of fresh baked bread. We haven't tried much else with it but we're very pleased.
1,Smells,"As the owners manual states, it may smell when first operated because of the oils used in its construction. Well so far I have run it empty of bread mixture three times, cleaning the grease that oozes out of the shaft that connects to the bread pan. And it still stinks of hot, almost burning grease. A couple more tries and then I call the manufacture and possibly return it."
1,"Low quality, poor customer service","I love making bread. I have 3 machines and the breadman is the worst quality I've seen. After only a few dozen loaves of bread there were ware spots on the inside of the pan which caused the bread to stick. When I reported this to customer service they put me through numerous hoops only to tell me at the end that they would sell me a new pan for an outragious amount of money.My least expensive machine, an Oster, has made over 100 loaves of bread and has no problems. I use it mainly for making dough that I then place in other pans to bake now. Although it bakes well too I prefer a different shape of loaf.My Zojirushi is fantastic and it makes a more traditionally shaped loaf of bread so I use it for most loaves that I allow to cook in the machine.So I would say go for the inexpensive Oster or go up to the Zojirushi. The only thing the breadman has going for it is its stainless steel pretty looks and this will not help your bread at all."
4,Does what it is supposed to.,"This is my first breadmaker, so bear this in mind. I have no complaints, I believe it does what it should. You definitely have to eat the bread in a day or two or it will go stale. I wish there were different loaf shapes to choose from. Do other bread makers come with such an option, I wonder? Other than that, so far I am very happy with the Breadman and would say that it was also an excellent price here on Amazon.ALSO, the breadmaker came in 1 day!! I do not know how Amazon did that, but I was stunned. I have never received anything so quickly in my lifetime of ordering stuff on-line."
2,Not the best breadmaker,I received this breadmaker as a gift after my beloved one finally played out. This one was a big disappointment. The bread tastes funny and the size and browness is inconsistent. I don't recommend this product.
1,A Dud,I have had this machine for 3 years. It was great for about 1.5 years and then the motor started going. It's just about dead now. I paid about $60 at walmart.
1,Stay away from this one,"I just got this today and was so excited to make a loaf of bread. While it was mixing it made a loud ""catching"" sound where something under the pan was hitting on something else.... am returning it right away!!!"
1,Kneading noise makes everyone crazy,"Before I bought it, I searched the breadmakers on websites. I choosed it even it's rate only 3.5 on Amazon. This breadmaker's function is powerful. The only one problem is the kneading noise. When it kneading, it bothered my neighbors! I also can't eat the fresh bread in the morning. Beacaus if I use delay mode to make a bread in the morning, and everybody will wake up!!! So, I return it."
5,breadman TR2500BC ULTIMATE,Needed to go healthy! Making my own breads made it possible to watch the ingredents. The Breadman TR2500BC is easy to operate and (wow) what loaves of bread this bread machine can produce.Even fantastic oatmeal bread! Very pleased with my purchase. A Top quality convection breadmaker that is not overly priced.
2,Bread machine is not for us,"We made three loaves of bread. One was too sticky, next one was too hard and third one was nothing special. We prefer to make our bread in conventional way. We returned the bread maker within few weeks."
4,Breadman for Fresh Bread,"This is our first bread machine. It works very well, There is a little learning curve to input your own recipes into the machine. After that you always have them in the memory. We love the machine. The very first loaf was perfect as all of them after. Yes it does make noise but it's not unbeariable. Certainly not as much noise as getting out the pots and pans, mixing batter and all that by hand. It does move around a little, it's almost fun to watch. It makes two size loaves one and two pound. The bread is tender airy, to tough and chewy depending on your recipe and really good hot out of the machine. We checked all over and Amazon had the best price by far. The machine arrived well packaged and with no problems."
1,Definately not automatic,"I've attempted to make white bread twice since receiving the Breadman Ultimate Plus TR2500BC a week ago and both have failed. Each time, during the knead cycle, the pan is dislodged from the retaining ears and the motor continues to turn but the beater does not. I've had to stand over the machine and resecure the pan several times during this cycle. After the dough has risen and the second kneading cycle begins the pan pops up again. If I am not there to catch it, the dough is ruined. I called customer-no-service three days ago and have not received a response. I tried to spread open the retaining ears to hold the pan in place but this has not helped. I do no recommend this bread machine and plan to return mine as it is far from being automatic and reliable."
4,Breadman TR2500BC breadmaker,[[ASIN:B000BXD5WQ Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus 2-Pound Stainless-Steel Convection Breadmaker Good product. First I ordered the top of line ZO.Couldn't get a loaf of bread we could eat. Terrible.Sent it back and got this one.Every loaf wonderful except my whole wheat. Zo doesn't have the features this machine has. The auto dispenser for extras is so great to have.Also to be able to choose loaf size.The Zo made every loaf too dark on light setting and well lets say disaster. I love the pause feature also. I try and get to bread if I'm here and remove mixing paddle before rise 3. Like bread with just a small hole in bottom.Machine is noisy. But I can stand the noise for such nice bread. Cost less than half the ZO. Doesn't have the quality feel of the ZO. But heck who cares about that I want bread we can eat.The cookbook has lots of recipes in it.I think for under $100 this is a good breadmaker. We love homemade bread. Probably going to gain 30 pounds this year.
1,The worst breadmachine and customer service in the market,The machine just does not work. Is is extremelly noisy. I called customer service to complain and told me it was my dough. I have been making bread for a long long time and I KNOW it is not the dough. Very bad customer service they really do not care Stay away for this machine nothing but trouble
1,BAD,i got one of these Breadman Ultiamate Plus for Christmas. The first one did not work. I got another.The second one worked 2 times and can not get it to work any more. What is going on with all the quality control in the making of all these so called wonderful breadmakers. The latches don't work so therefore it won't start. The worst machine I have had. Do not recommand it at all. Too much hassel. You spend all your time sending in the plug for the model. No time making bread.[[ASIN:B000BXD5WQ Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus 2-Pound Stainless-Steel Convection Breadmaker]
4,Homemade is just better.,"Homemade bread is just better than anything you can buy at the store. I have been making two loaves a week and my husband loves it. I would have given the machine 5 stars except that there is one flaw with the machine. The pan slipped out of its groove when it was kneading and made a terrible racket, but it was an easy fix. I just bent the little metal thing back out that holds the pan in place, and it hasn't done it again. I figure it will happen again at some point in time, so I don't make bread unless I will be around to listen for the rattle. I have read in other reviews that people return the machine when their pan did this, but it was really very easy to fix, and I love the bread enough to put up with the possiblity that the machine may rattle a little every now and then."
5,Awesome breadmaker,"This is an awesome piece of equipment. I have made jam, dough, and a few loaves of bread. The bread comes out with a nice even texture, and I like the fact that you just pick up the loaf pan to get it out of the machine. There's no twisting to get the pan to fit in the machine. It's quiet and offers a good number of choices for your bread. This breadmaker is well worth the money."
4,Some shortcomings persist,"As before, the flour needs to be scraped from the corners of the loaf pan because the paddle would not incorporate all the flour into the dough ball. I did not notice any significant change in the crust from the previous version of Breadman (Ultimate), even though the product description asserts that the convection effect is designed to produce crustier loafs. Overall, I am satisfied with this machine since I have learned through multiple trials and errors which recipe works best for me. I should note that I have used the original Breadman machine until the heating element stopped working, and then Breadman Ultimate, also until the heating element stopped baking. My family likes the homemade bread, and I have been using the bread machines 2-3 times a week."
1,took it back,"After trying 1 loaf, we took this back to the store. Maybe this particular machine was defective, but it was not level, and wiggled around on the counter so much I was afraid to leave it alone. It was very noisy and sounded like it was going to fall apart. I had a Panasonic bread machine for the last 16 years and it finally gave out, so I think I will replace it with another Panasonic. That machine was solid and well built."
4,I love my bread machine,"It's easy to make and I usually use it just to mix the flour. A wonderful addition to my tools in the kitchen. A little noisy, but it doesn't bother me at all."
3,"Bakes bread well, but problems with machine","The first machine I ordered arrived with a dent due to damage in shipping. Amazon very quickly replaced it with a second machine. I had a difficult time removing the pan from this machine, but it eventually came out. I baked two loaves of bread that turned out very well. Then, when the third loaf was done, I could not remove the pan from the machine no matter how hard I pulled. It seemed to be stuck, not on the side clips, but on the shaft that turns the kneading paddle. I had to remove the bread from the hot pan using rubber spatulas. The kneading paddle came out, but the pan was still stuck. I returned the machine."
2,Breadman Ultimate Plus basket issues,"Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus 2-Pound Stainless-Steel Convection BreadmakerBreadman Ultimate Plus is a good machine; however, after having mine for only two years, the basket broke while making jam. That wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I now have jam all through the inside of my Breadman. The mechanism on which the paddle sits simply came apart in the middle of the jam cycle. Now I have no bread machine. This is disappointing since the machine itself was fine before the basket broke."
3,Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus 2-Pound Stainless-Steel Convection Breadmaker,well this is my fourth breadmaker in twenty plus years the first was a wel-built then the last three breadman but will say the last two I have been diappointed in but like all else quality just isnt there any more so sad
3,Breadman Warranty,Well wouldn't you know it...! One month after the warranty is up the shaft in the bread pan failed and the paddle scraped all the Teflon off the pan bottom around it....The shaft falls out and is very loose and doesn't mix the dough now.More after I hear from them on the issue...that is if I can actually get to talk to someone in my lifetime..?
3,Not the greatest but it's okay,"I bought this item thinking that it was the ultimate and the ""best""! I was wrong. The lid on the unit would not stay closed. My husband had to put an indentation into the cover so it would stay. The machine also moves all over the cabinet when it is working on dough sometimes. I also had a hard time keeping the pan in place. It was repeatedly coming out of it's holders and I had to keep opening the cover to fix it, leaving my bread a little flatter than normal. If I had the chance, I would have bought a different breadmaker. It hasn't burnt anything and I've managed to make good italian, rye and french honey bread eventually, but it took some trial and error with this machine."
2,not good quality,"Despite the negative reviews, I purchased this machine because of the different features. However, the negative reviews were correct. The pan would not stay in place during the kneading cycle. I have to keep pausing the machine and put the pan back in place. Also, the machine jumps all over the counter. I am returning this to Amazon."
1,Heed the Negative Reviews,"The negative reviews on this machine are correct. I have owned three previous bread machines over the past several years, so I am not a newbie. I followed the directions meticulously, and the breadpan popped out of the clips on the very first loaf, on the very first knead cycle. I bent the pins outward some in an attempt to gain better grip, but to no avail. The pan continued to pop out. This machine is useless and will be going back to the store tomorrow. Save yourself the aggravation and do not buy this model."
1,Faulty right out of the box... only partly working display. :(,"I just spent an hour trying to figure this thing out. I finally did. It's broken. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong to set it for white or wheat bread, Well, The problem is that part of the display is dead.I didn't buy this from amazon, but from a department store. Trouble is I live way out in the country. So, it's a 200 mile round trip to return this thing. Not good.The display and control panel don't look like they are made very well, or maybe I just got a poorly assembled one. In any case, don't think that I'll get another."
1,NO GO,"The first one came severely damaged, the second one came damaged but we thought what the heck, just keep it.Making 3 loafs of bread was not without difficulties. The mixer blade jumped out of its socket 3 times, a real problem if you have set the machine on delayed timer and are not able attending it. The one time it did not jump the loaf came out great. After 8 days I tried to make another loaf and ... blank, no sign of life in the machine. So back it went and we are now looking for a different brand and distributor. To top it off, it took Amazon 6 weeks to credit me back and that not without investigation."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I just opened my Breadman TR2500BC. The brushed aluminum on the front of the unit is dented in 3 places and the finish is bad. The control panel is peeling off the unit. The images shown make the control panel appear to be ""built into the unit"", rather than just glued on. I gave it one star just based on the workman ship. Returning to Amazon."
2,defective pan,"We were initially very happy with this machine, but after 15 months of moderate use, the spindle that holds the paddle in place fell out of the pan. The Teflon coating on the bottom of the pan is flaking off. I assume that both Teflon flakes and the disintegrated attachment ring were probably baked into our last loaf of bread.In addition, The motor strains when making dense/whole grain breads. Finally, the keypad on the top of the machine is difficult to ""read"" and the switches (and switch covering) are of poor quality and unreliable.[ASIN:B000BXD5WQ Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus 2-Pound Stainless-Steel Convection Breadmaker]]"
5,ABSOLUTELY PLEASED WITH THIS MACHINE,"I compared this machine with several others including the most expensive dual paddle mixer, and the only thing this didn't do is have the selection panel light up. As a matter of fact I like it better than the 2 paddle bread machine because no.1, it does the same exact thing, plus an extra or two and 2. for the price it can't be beat. I am going back for a 2nd one because I use mine so much, I need two even three to get all the baking I do accomplished. I have had mine for over 2 years now and I would't give it up for any amount of money, just another one like it. By the way, the recipe book that comes with it has been my bible, plus I also make many of my own creations. Wish I were getting paid for this gush, but, I am that passionate about this Breadman model."
2,Horrible customer service; replacement parts unavailable.,"I just purchased this unit a couple of weeks ago and although it works okay, it is very hard to get the bread pan in and out of the machine. I usually have to have put the machine on the floor to get sufficient leverage to take the pan out or put it back in, which is very inconvenient.I have also been trying to find spare paddles since I tend to lose mine, and I have been surprised that there are no replacement parts available any where on the web. I have tried calling their customer service line but just get put on an eternal hold."
1,Didn't Work,"When you plug the machine in, it is supposed to beep and then you push select to enter the bread cycle you want. Mine beeped and I played around with it for a few minutes to figure it out. Then I unplugged it and a few hours later I put all the ingredients into the pan and plugged it in again. No beep. I tried other outlets. The light came on, but that was all. Didn't even get to make 1 loaf of bread."
1,wrong machine sent,I bought this expecting to receive the model as described---TR 900s. What I received was the TR 2500---a more complex machine. That is the image that is being used too. I am not sure if this was Target's fault or Amazon's but I sent it back anyway...and then bought a Zoji.
1,return,"I returned this product due to Amazon sending it to me in only the box it was originally packed in. It was not double packed in a shipping box so when I got it even the styrafoam inside was broken, the box was torn, the side of the box was torn too. Could not give as a gift in that condition."
1,H02 error again!,"It was a great player.But once it cannot work at all, then it'll never be a good one.Got H02 error after one year I bought this dvd player.Fixed this problem by the way told by other users, tapping the while circle while you open the cover.Then it worked well as before for a while.But recently, about months later, the problem happened again.I think it's way enough ... I'm gonna get another new one."
3,H02 DVD Error,"I have a Technics HDV600. I too had the H02 error that is making everyone so unhappy. I managed to get my DVD player working again by removing the cover, plugging the machine back into the mains and trying again. I found that the disk was not being spun so i simply pressed down on the white circle above the Tray and this made it start spinning again.I hope this infomation can help others.. i can also sugest unplugging from the mains for 30 mins to reset the machine, also u could try opening and shutting the draw without a dvd inserted. This may encourage the DVD to spin..As far as i can tell the H02 error means either the motor is broken or malfunctioned."
2,eh....,"O.K. The video is great and the audio's superior. But the reason I bought this player is for MP3- that's what really distinguishes it from other products in it's price range. And it does play MP3's <sometimes> in the recorded track order. No program, no shuffle, no random- just play. So you can have a cd with 140 songs on it and listen to the same ones in the same order over and over... sorry Panasonic- major development oversight. all in all, not much better than an Apex, but a bit more expensive. btw, it was really acting up for about a half hour when i first got it <making weird noises- gliching and such> it's doing fine now though."
4,good player at a great price,"I bought this DVD player knowing next to nothing about DVD's but I read a lot of reviews here on amazon and this panansonic looked good. I use this player in my bedroom for mainly DVD viewing, so I can't really comment on the MP3 player or its features. I haven't had any problems with it, except one of my lower-quality DVD's makes lines go across the TV screen when it plays, but its hardly noticeable. Overall, I think it is a good quality player for the amount of money you pay. There are pros and cons with every model, it seems, so just research before you do any purchasing."
5,Great DVD,"I am really happy with the reception and excited about my new DVD player. What a great product and I am really glad I bought this particular DVD player. It is easy to use, and so far, it has been a great purchase."
2,Poor Quality DVD - Constantly Skipping,"I recently purchased this DVD player based on the reviews it had received. However, the DVD player I recieved in the mail today seemed to be an exception to them. After a relatively easy install (despite the fact that Panasonic did NOT include an S-Video cable), I popped in a DVD and expected to see high resolution video. However, I had trouble from the beginning. The remote was hard to use and the selector/enter keys didn't work. The movie skipped and eventually froze. I tried 3 DVD's to make sure that it wasn't the disc causing the problems. I haven't tried the MP3-CD option, mostly because my new toy was quickly being packed-up and driven to the post office. I requested a replacement DVD, convinced that a quality company such as Panasonic would not sell defective products."
4,Pretty good,It is pretty good for the money. The only I thing I noticed is that the color seems to fade in and out when I am watching a DVD. It may be my TV because I would not notice it unless the picture is clear (which a DVD is). But otherwise it is a great buy.
1,Nice if it continued to work.,"I will start out by saying that I loved this DVD player. It did everything I wanted it to do and di it very well. No complaints on the actual performance. My 1 star is because I have owned two of them already and they have both given ""H02"" errors which, from my understanding, means they need a new laser which is about $90. They both failed after the warranty period. It starts at digitized boxes happening during DVD play (have cleaning products for the player and the DVDs) and soon progresses into ruined machine. So now my second failed with the same error and I can't bring myself to get it fixed or get another for fear of a threepeat."
5,Great fun at a great price,"Speaking as a puzzle builder for many years now, this was a really fun one to build! It was simple enough to assemble, but had just enough complexity to make it enjoyable. A child of 8 or 9 could easily build this with little or no supervision. Love this one!~"
1,Poor quality wood,"The wood is not solid wood, but more like thin pressed sheets of wood that were diecut. As a result, when trying to press the pieces out, the wood would split; very fragile...have some glue handy or else the layers will come apart on you.It came with a *small* piece of sandpaper to smooth over rough edges, too. However, the wood was so fragile it would come apart as you sanded it."
2,Poor quality,The wood kept on falling apart and was very dry. It was extremely hard to build because the pieces would not come out.
4,Simply great.,"I just finished reading this book. Knowing little more than what the average person knows about the nineteenth century, I closed the book feeling enlightened and intrigued. Hobsbawm writes well, and he manages to bring together very complex concepts and mechanisms into simple sentences. It is a daunting experience trying to compress forty years of world history into four hundred pages, but Hobsbawm manages to pull it off in most places.There is enough primer material in this book for a lifetime of further study. Hobsbawm instills a sense of curiosity in the reader, and I spent much time oodling over reference books and online sources trying to patch together the facts and events referred to in ""Age of Empire: 1875-1914"".What can I say? I wanted to know more about colonialism, industrialisation and economic progress in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, and ""Age of Empire: 1875-1914"" fit the bill very well indeed."
1,Japanese engineers write better English prose,"This book is, without doubt, the worst example of English prose I have ever read. The gentleman is probably an outstanding scholar. But one must diagram each and every sentence to force his ideas into some sort of order. (But as a caveat, I only got half-way through it before my patience ran out.)Then again, I'm not a historian, my Ph.D. is in applied psychology. In my career(Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University), I've had many opportunities to see what engineers, psychologists, and especially engineers for whom English is a third for fourth language do to mangle English prose. This gentleman's writing style is worse than anything I've ever seen. His English prose is worse than that of a Japanese engineer.Was it Dorothy Parker who said, ""This is not a book to be lightly put down. It is a book to be thrown away with vehemence""? Or some such."
5,PURE MAGIC!!,"I have been following this artist since the beginning of 1991 and words cannot begin to describe ALEJANDRO SANZ. He is a master in the music field. He evokes every emotion possible with every word that he pronounces. A pure POET! I cannot even say which are my favorite songs, since each and every one of them opens up a new emotional portal for me."
2,Disappointing,"I've been a fan of Robert Fripp's collaborations with other artists, but I had never purchased one of his solo recordings. The previous reviewers go on and on about the moving aural beauty of this CD, but I simply didn't find it. I thought these ""soundscapes"" were vacant and irritating. If you're looking for something moving, why not try David Sylvian or Lisa Gerrard."
4,A challenging story about a mother's response to the London bombings,"Anthony Fatayi-Williams is one of the 52 people who died in the 7 July London bombings. His mother's book is a heart-wrenching recounting of the story of those days after the bombing when they slowly began to realise that their son had been one of the victims. What stands out is the amazing group of family and friends that Anthony had and the tireless way in which they tried to find him and, after his death was confirmed, worked towards bringing peace out of the tragedy.The story also gives hope of religious tolerance - Marie is Catholic, her husband is a Muslim, and Anthony's friends were both Christian and Muslim. In the latter part of the book Marie speaks about the police and other authorities and their failings with regard to their treatment of the victims' families.It's a sobering book but also a challenge to work towards peace."
5,Tremendous !,"Lisa and Barry have really hit it with this CD. A rollercoaster of emotion from the Bluesy ""Damn Your Eyes"" to the hard driving ""Contemporay Madness"". Lisa's voice will hold your attention from start to finish. ""Nobody's Somebody"" may even bring a tear to your eye. Finally, the world finds out what we have known for years, Lisa Guyer is a tremendous talent whos time has come. Our only misfortune is not being able to keep her to ourselves any longer."
2,Watch out for Live!'s....,"While the sound quality isnt anything to complain about, the setup, drivers, and software for the original Live!'s and the 5.1 cards are absoutely horrible. I've never seen a manufacturer pump out so many high-rated soundcards with such buggy, system-crashing drivers. I have no idea how companies rate the Live!'s so highly when a solid 50% of users have driver problems from the beginning. Browsing the internet to find out how everyone else thought of these cards, I discovered an extraordinarily high percentage of people who had serious problems with the SB Live!'s. Save yourself some money and a lot of time and find a non-Creative soundcard. I dont think you want to end up reformatting your whole harddrive like me and many other SB Live! consumers."
1,"driver problem for XP and media player 9, slow the CPU","I have many problems with the driver for my XP. I have tried all the new drivers from the Creative Lab, it finally let it deliver the sound to the 5.1 chanel. Have to turn off the digital mode to heard the sound and only analog mode allowed. Sound quality is kind of poor proabaly due to the driver. Itsignificantly slowed down the performance of my computer, and wont work with the new MS media player 9. After uninstall this product, it crash my system, my computer keeping rebooting. it turn out that I have to reformat C: to restore my system. Also found mnay users have the same problems on the web. Keep away from this card if you are using XP. (my spec:Sony VAIO RX650, P4-1.6A 512DDR). I also found this card wont work with VIA chipset that most of AMD computers."
1,Only buy this if you are running Windows 98,"I suppose this is supposed to be a very good sound card, but it seems that the only operating system that it fully supports is Windows 98. Many of the options are not available if you are running Windows 2000 and Windows XP is particularly problematic. Of course, there are no products in the Creative line which say that they support Windows XP, even though they do have some drivers out which kinda work on occasion. I unforturnately was running Windows 2000 when I purchased this card and it was severely limited in what it would do due to the limitations of the operating system according to Creative. A Turtle Beach Santa Cruz is a much better choice for a lot less money and it actually works as advertised."
3,Decent Reference Book,"This might be the only engineering text you'll ever see that is HAND-LETTERED! Yes, Octave Levenspiel's famously neat handwritting is present on almost every page, and that includes the graphs and figures. Besides the novelty value, the Omnibook is a fairly decent reference book. Don't try to learn reaction engineering from this book alone; equations and concepts are simply applied and are not derived or developed in any way whatsoever. This can lead to some confusion if you haven't brushed up recently on the basic concepts. If you know the concepts but can't exactly remember how to apply them, then it works great. It also makes a fine supplement to either Levenspiel's _Chemical Reaction Engineering_ or the (slightly superior, in my opinion) _Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering_ by Fogler."
2,Missing Chapters,"I think the Omnibook is a great text, very clear and very helpful in a subject that can be overwhelming (for me, at least). I love that it is hand written and full of diagrams.Unfortunately, my copy of this book seemed to be missing chapters. My classmates all had different editions of the book, and theirs seemed to have more chapters that my book skipped over entirely. If I had to do it again, I'd just pay full price at the campus bookstore to get the complete version."
5,no title could describe,"This is the best rap CD I have ever heard, no doubt. I bought this for two dollars in the bargain bin ata record store about a year and a half ago after I heard his track on the menace II Society soundtrack. I have been a die hard DJ Quik fan( and his homies AMG, 2nd II NOne, and Hi-C) ever since. This CD defined my summer this year with me and my buddies havin parties and blarin this. It got all the ladies into a dancing mood and I think that is one of the things Quik strives for: a fun party jam to get the ladies goin'. With songs early on like ""We Still Party"" and ""So Many Wayz"", Quik really knows how to start an album. I own all of his CD's and this one contends as his best. If you want to have a fun time next summer, barbecues and dance parties, buy this CD within the next 6 months. Peace."
5,OAKLAND CA LIKE WHAA WHAA,OAKLAND RAPPERS ARE THE BEST IM FROM OAKLAND AND MOST OF THEM SPEAK ABOUT HOW THEM OAKLAND STREETS ARE AND THATS REAL THATS WHY YOU SHOULD GET THE CD HE SPEAK THE REAL !!WEST OAKLAND CYPRESS 1000 MURDA MURDA BIG BLOCK KNOW ABOUT IT
1,Well.........?!?!,The reason i gave this cd one star is bcuz it has one good song!!! Makes sense dont it?!
3,i initially bought the cd for the cover,"and thats the only good thing about the cd. dj quik sucks, but he got good hair."
1,32 Year old Queens nigga,Never really liked this cat West coast rap never really moved me plus he wears a gay perm....WTF??? that was never hip hop thats some wack pimp garbage ....one love to tru headz....real niggas is still watching and listening...
1,DJ QUIK Fan,"Hola mi llamo es CHAYO y yo am a ""DJ QUIK"" from COMPTON, CALIFORNIA I grew up in the same neighborhood DJ QUIK grew up in. Neddless, to say he is a very sprital individual in the music indusry that alot of people do not give credit to because some people need to do their research on DJ QUIK (DAVID BLAK). His first album was PAID THE COST recorded with the PENTHOUSE PLAYERS CLIQ including songs with EAZY-E. Other rappers include HI-C, PLAYER-HAM,AMG,R-KELLY (LIFE),2PAC,TONY TONY,SHACK O NELL,ADINA HOWARD,D COX,JERMANIE DUPRI, and many many others."
2,2.5 Stars,"DJ Quik is a great producer, but this album does not show his skills as a rapper. NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,This is DA SH#T No F#ckin' Doubt!!!,"Yo', DJ Quik is a f#ckin' genius!!! This album has one of the BEST production I've ever heard! Almost every track is funky as f#ck and geniusly puted, Quik is awsom with he's rap and rhyms and the guests on the album are HELLA TIGHT... what can you posably want more!!! some of the best songs are ""Down, Down, Down"", ""Youz da Gangsta"", ""I Useta know her"" and ""medly for a V (the p#ssy medly)"" with Snoop, Nate Dogg and other tight a** playes! get that sh#t!!!"
4,Tightest flows ever heard from a DJ!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD from Quick is tight. The only thing that stopped me from giving it five stars is the amount of guests he had and the stuff he talked about. Some of the guests ruined his flow, and hearing him talk about getting some in every song gets tiring and repetitive, but thats minor. When you really jam this CD in your house set or car it's live. Just to hear him rap is phat and to me he has one of the tightest cd's out than any other DJ. (Even funk master flex) All those in dought should get this. He is like a combination of Nate dog and q-tip together."
2,"Great Research, But Romance Novel In Disguise","You should believe what the reviewer for Publisher's Weekly says about the stilted prose and the one-dimensional characters in this book. Sundaresan's wonderful job with the setting and history of this time in India are diminished by the corny love story. When the unfolding ""romance"" is the focus, everything gets gushy and begins to sound like a Danielle Steele novel gone amuck. I hope Sundaresan keeps writing and gets the two halves (believeable historical details and believable characters) to balance out a bit more."
1,Dissapointing,"I found this a very dissapointing read. The author's understanding of courtly life is shallow as is her use of court language. Apart from some factual errors--which may be overlooked since this is after all fiction, the characters of Mehurnissa, Prince Salim or any of the others, are not fully developed. I really did not care one or other what happened to any of them.This is a very interesting period in Indian history and deserves a more understanding treatment."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of historical fiction (The Borgia Bride; The Red Tent; I, Elizabeth; anything by Phillippa Gregory, etc) but was rather disappointed by The Twentieth Wife, especially the lack of closure at the end of the novel, as if it were written merely in preparation for the sequal. While I appreciate the level of research and commend the author's dedication to her subject and trying to capture the world Melrunnissa lived in, I felt parts of the book lacked direction and were quite boring and long-winded. Additionally, while the author was so methodical in her research, it was disappointing that the dialogue did not ring true to this time period."
4,Excellent read,"Someone recommended this book to me in the doctor's office. I'm afraid I haven't had a chance to read it, but based on her comments I am anxious to start reading as I have a passion for historical novels. She said it was an excellent book.The Twentieth Wife: A Novel"
2,mediocre history and romance,"I have to say I was dissappointed with this book. I really wanted to like it...it had been strongly recommended--i love history and historical fiction and the Mughal period in history, but the writing fell short. The characters are mere sketches for whom the reader cannot develop any real empathy. The romance between Jahangir and Mehrunnissa is not given any depth. There are numerous very basic cultural and linguistic inaccuracies that should have been corrected in editing. The descriptive writing borders on cliche and stereotype. Not impressed."
4,The twentieth wife,I am going to buy the next book of the series.I enjoy historical fiction and this book was great. The characters are all so believable and interesting.
3,Historical rundown but little else,"The fact that this is a historical novel keeps things interesting, but the unfortunate part is that the interesting bits pretty much ends there. The history is mainly presented as if it's a bullet list of events that the author wants to be sure are not left out of her story. The character development is seriously lacking. While there are some good bits, there are many portions where the author just gets through things, especially near the end. Her descriptives are actually pretty basic. Whether it be descriptives of love or Nisa's wedding outfit, I was quite surprised at the amateurish writing.I don't plan to read the sequel, but I will likely give the author another chance by reading one of her much newer novels. I hope she has stepped away from the simplistic and amateurish descriptives and really builds out her characters more in the context of historical fiction."
5,A Great Book,Indu Sundaseran transports one into a different time and place - The Mughal Empire. This novel brings out the rich historical figures that shaped part of India as we know it today. She does her research and clearly shows intricate depth in her writing and story-telling. It is a great book.
2,Promising Start,"I agree with many of the Editorial Reviews above. There are so many nice things to say about this book - facinating historical periods that are rarely used in American books, intriguing characters and interesting events. However, it is easy to be distracted by the stilted writing and the lack of character development. As much promise as this book had, it reads more like a Danielle Steele novel - the main character claws her way out of poverty (with well-timed, if unexplained, assistance from other characters) to become the most powerful woman in her region. I hope Indu Sundaresan continues to develop her writing skills because she has certainly found an interesting topic."
2,Too wordy and too many characters.,"There were far too many characters and they changed their names. I could not keep upl with the story because I was forgetting who did what. I read for relaxation, this was far too complicated and I read at least 2 books a month."
4,Engaging,This is quite well written and an engaging book. The author managers to generate some authentic romantic buzz between the two leads and takes the reader into this world quite well. If you're interested in this period of history and like a romance you'll probably enjoy it.
2,I wanted to like it,"I generally like historical fiction and I'm fascinated by India culture. However this book dragged in the middle. I thought it was going to be a love story, but at least half of the book detours away from the story about the main characters. I had to push myself to finish it and I don't think I'm going to read the others as I had planned."
2,Just a love story,"I enjoyed this book but it was basically just a very long love story with a predictable ending. I know next to nothing about the history of India and enjoy learning my history through fiction, but this book didn't help. I didn't realize this book was really just a long love story based on truth. It did have some peppering of history throughout but I found it a bit tiresome just reading about the angst between this couple that you know will finally get together in the end. Definitely a ""chick book"" in my opinion despite some talk of fighting and male envy/jealousy as to who gets to be king. If you want to read a love story - go ahead but if you want real history, move on."
2,I got thru it,"Another book I had to read for book club. If you've followed any of my reviews you know this is not my style. I don't get how an author basically relates historical facts with some character interaction around them. The characters were disjointed and didn't relate well. Also, several of my friends had not researched this and realized this is a tale in two books. We were all disappointed at where the author decided to end the tale, after struggling so hard to get to that point. Just very one dimensional. The world did not feel alive, it felt much like a fictionalized school history book."
5,Engaging & Quick Read,"The Twentieth Wife provided great information on Persia/India, the European trading history with them and interesting information on the role of the femail in their society. A quick read. Easy to get into and held my attention until the end wanting me to go on an read the sequel."
1,Editing anyone?,I think this book could have been a lot better if the editing were done correctly. I found all the mistakes boring and annoying. I will not be reading any more books by this writer at least not until Indu Sundaresan gets a few more books underbelt!
3,Alright but...,"This book starts out very well and is interesting and enthralling when a wealthy common girl falls in love with the emperor's son. Engaging and well written at first, the book takes a change for the worst about a third of the way through and becomes a dry historical account of an internal political war. It moves entirely away from the main character and turns into a contest of who can kill their own father first and assume the throne. The characters become plane and two dimensional while the plot becomes slow. I was very excited when I first got this book but I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed."
5,Page-turner,"Interesting and captivating story, with enough historical background to make it feel real. A good look at life in that time through the eyes of a strong and driven woman."
4,A intriguing and pleasurable read,"the books weaves fiction and history together beautifully, allowing readers a glimpse into the lives at the imperial court in 17th-Century India. Easy to follow with fascinating characters and storylines."
3,Had to Read it for a Class,"Not sure that this review would be helpful much. I had to find a book that pertained to a cultural period that I was studying for class. Out of all the books I've looked at, this one caught my interest the most because of the storyline, the author's reputation, and accuracy to history (even though its a historical fiction). Still reading the book at the moment, so can't say that I've come to a like or dislike conclusion as yet."
2,I tried so hard to like this book...,"I tried so hard to like this book. The story is a magnificent one, the history so alive but I couldn't get myself past the fact that a 6-8 year old could be so wordly and articulate. Her obsession and goal to marry Prince Salim from such a young age held little ground. No reason or impetus was given for this sudden aspiration. I only got to chapter 3 when I had to put it down as it lacked conviction and authority."
4,An engrossing read about an interesting time and place,"This was a well-crafted historic novel about women in the Mughal Empire (what is now Pakistan, Afghanistan and India) several hundred years ago. Characters are engaging, and the intrigues of various attempts at the throne are shown in interesting ways, recalling similar fights for supremacy in England of old. If the test of a novel is that it interests you in the time period and setting, this one is a success."
5,A Memorable Journey,"Indu Sundaresan's The Twentieth Wife claimed my attention in a way that books rarely do. From the beginning I was vested in the characters, but even more strongly, in the time and place in which they live. The details are astonishing in their complexity, and Sundaresan is equally at home portraying the harsh conditions of a nomadic existence or the opulence of palace life. She has a gift for creating a sense of ""place,"" and originating from that ""place,"" her characters are memorable and compelling. Finishing the book, I felt as if I'd taken a journey, one both vivid and memorable."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book after reading a rave review of it. I enjoy books with strong or memorable characters - this book had neither. Everything always worked out too well. Her father's embezzlement was brushed aside, but would in reality have not been tolerated. In the author's epilogue, she characterizes the real Mehrunnisa as mean, treacherous, in charge; yet the author made her too saccarinely sweet in the book; she was definitely not a memorable character. Nor was the emperor - at first he was evil and corrupt, then suddenly upon becoming emperor, he became thoughtful of his people - give me a break! While I recognize and appreciate the author's extensive research into this time period, I was amazed that the book was accepted for publication, since we never really even care about any of the characters! If you would like to read a book about India with memorable characters, read A Fine Balance by Mistry...now, there is a great book!"
2,Just okay...,"as an avid reader of historical fiction, I can honestly say this is not the worst book I have read. However, the author's many mistakes really make this hard to read- for example, I have never heard of the word ""Bapa"" being used to address one's father (I grew up speaking Urdu)- and the author refers to the maternal grandfather as ""Dada""- when the word is Nana. Mughal women did not wear ""ghagara""s (loose skirts); rather they wore ""gharaara""s, a sort of split skirt with embroidery and embellishments. And Muslims don't greet each other with ""InshaAllah""- which means, God Willing- the author uses this phrase numerous times as a greeting or salutation. If you are familiar with the culture and language, it is annoying to read these mistakes."
1,Unreliable,"I recieved this drive as a gift Christmas 2001. Right off, burning CD's turned out to be a huge hassle as I had to ""coaster"" about half of the 50 or so CD's I attempted to burn in the first month. As it was pretty much the burner I was stuck with, I kept it, only to have it [fail]me by September 2002. Go with another brand."
1,Time to go to bed . . .,"I still have a CD stuck in the thing, but I have to get some sleep. This thing has disabled my computer five times in the last two hours. Which is to say, each time I have tried to use it. I have no idea if this product works for some people, but for this computer savvy boy it is one amazing headache. The fact that Iomega includes a postcard exhorting you to not return the product to the store without first consulting Iomega ""customer support"" is a very, very good indication that they have very little faith in the likelihood of this product working. Maybe tomorrow I can get that CD out . . ."
2,Works well but doesn't lasts,"I was pretty happy with this unit. However, after around one year and two months it wouldn't start anymore. I expected more durability for [the moeny]. I don't think I'll waste my money with IOMEGA again."
1,"If the CD-RW has the wrong S/N, Win98 won't recognize it","I purchased this CD-RW and went home to install. After hours of installing and reinstalling, looking at troubleshooting pages, and finally finding an obsure page with the answer, I found out that any of these particular CD-RWs that start with serial number 5TD will not be recognized by Win98. Guess what the serial number on my CD-RW started with? Iomega admits it was a problem they just discovered. Had I been warned in the beginning I would not have bought this particular unit. I packed the unit up and returned it the next day. Think I will shop for another brand that works."
3,"Not so great, but it's portable","I had problems with Buffer Underrun errors. Unfortunately, unlike it's internal counterparts, this CD Burner has no buffer underrun protection... for those of you wandering what that means... if it doesn't work perfect the first copy, your CD-R becomes a coaster. I have a HP laptop with a DVD player in it, and read on Iomega's site, that there are problems sometimes when using a DVD player as the source. If your machine is too fragmented you can also get the buffer underruns. I had to check Iomega's support site for all the latest problems/solutions to get my system set up to burn reliably. For safety, I bump the speed down to 2x when burning now... no more problems, but it was a rough start and it's not too quick... (about 30-40 minutes to copy a data CD)"
2,Touchy & tempermental,"I have yet to be able to span several CD's to backup my drive, which was the reason for buying it. After the second CD I get an error where the software says it can't find the next CD, when I put it in, it blows out the program completely...coasters everywhere and time down the tubes. I even bought QuickSync 3.0. That is no big help.Makes exact copies fine. Copies data files fine.Setup an HP 8220 or 8230, that one didn't work until I downloaded upgraded software. Then it seemed fine. Haven't tried a multi-CD backup with it.HP 9500 internal is the best I've worked with so far. Runs pretty fast and does pop up errors often. Haven't tried a multi-CD backup with it."
1,Cheap in price and quality,"This external USB burner never worked properly for me. Sometimes it would never be recognized as a drive, and it would take multiple uninstalls/reinstalls just to get it recognized. Then trying to burn a CD?! Forget about it, the software was not very good and it would stop half way through and ruin the CD. Not a good product and the tech support for this product is almost non-existent. They would continually blame my USB controller, which by the way has no issues with other USB devices, including other brand USB burners."
3,great once you can install it.,"I love this burner! It took awhile to install but after a few times un-installing and re-installing everything was fine. I've burned 3 CDs on 2x and they're in perfect condition. No coasters! I'm not sure if the problems were from the software, the burner, or Windows ME, but it works great now.The software could be better, but the music match that came with it makes up for it. I would suggest using that to burn music CDs instead of the other."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I was able to use my Iomega RW drive for a few months after I bought it. Then, one day, it would not recognize the drive. I have uninstalled and reinstalled many, many times and it still will not work. I have not been able to get any help from Iomega support. Also, sometimes the door to the drive would not open. I wish I had looked at the reviews before I bought it."
1,Gets too many write errors,"I was able to back up typical data but when I try to backup photos, the drive gives write errors. The write errors either trash the CD and/or lock up the PC so it requires a reboot. I have been trying to backup about 300Mb of photos and 4 hours later still have not been successful!! I would not recommend this product, not worth the headache!"
5,Great CD Burner!,Get this burner! I love it. I burned so many cd's on it and never had a problem with it. It takes about 15 minutes but whatever it's great. Get this burner and you'll never have a problem with it!
4,"easy install, does the job, but a little slow","If you want to burn audio CD's and make data CD's but don't want to install an internal CD-RW drive, then you might want to check out this item. Extremely easy/fast to install via the USB port. Burns CD's easily, but it's not the fastest. Comes with lots of software--Music Match jukebox and Adaptec CD wizard/Direct CD and some blank CDR's and a Verbatim CD-RW. Installs itself as a new drive. (Mine is drive F). Caution--for data discs--don't use generic CD-RW's. They will not work. Use the Verbatim DataLifePlus 2x-4x Rewritables. The unit requires you to format the CD-RW disc before the first use (which is an annoyance) but after that, all you do is drag and drop from Windows Explorer like you would with a diskette. Very Fast. No problem with any brand of CD-R's for audio. I've used various ones and all burned fine."
3,"Easy-to-use, reliable, but not a speed demon","I use this external USB 4x4x6 usb drive to backup data from my Toshiba notebook (using the Backup program that comes with Windows 98) and to make copies of cd-rw disks.I found this drive to be easy to use and quite reliable, but it is slow. It takes 20-25 minutes to backup,compress and verify 390MB of data, so it is no speed demon. I use Sony CD-RW disks and had no problems with storing data on them.If you have problems with using this USB cd-rw drive with your computer, you probably want to make sure you are using the Windows 98 SE (Second Edition) or higher on your computer. The older version of Windows 98 had some bugs and problems; Windows 98 SE (Second Edition) contains updates and bug fixes to provide better support for USB and FireWire devices."
3,"Works fine, but a little too big","The device does what it is supposed to do, but the size should be smaller to make it easy to take on trips. I had some (easily solvable, but still..) problems with the USB connection of another device when I installed the CD-RW on my laptop."
4,Really Easy to Install and Get Running,"I opened the box, followed the instructions, got it installed, and then backed up over 300 meg in My Documents and over 400 meg in my Outlook.PST. No gliches. Everything worked fine the first try. I love it. It is sooooo... much easier to get files backed up this way -- rather than using the 100 meg Zip disks. Only drawbacks are it's big, ugly, and slow (compared to the internal drives) -- but it is easy to install. And I needed something simple and reliable."
2,My evaluation!!,"Well, I bought this thing about a year ago because I had a lot of faith in IomegaZip. When I went from Win3.1 to 95 to 98, the software upgrades on my Zip100 were free for owners of the product. Not so with this: I upgraded to w2k and Iomega sent me to Adaptec sent me to Roxie to find out I had to BUY the software upgrade. SOLUTION: I 'borrowed' a new drive from the store and returned it later.A couple of the audio cd's I made wont play in my car stereo, but that could be the discs theirselves. If you want to use Nero, the adaptec software will conflict with it. I uninstalled adaptec, installed Nero and re-installed adaptec and then the software was compatible.But the software upgrade issue was the drawing line for me. There is just to much technological change to be charging people for upgrades so they can keep using the hardware they already bought! I'll never deal with Iomega or Adeptec or Roxie again."
5,great songs by this talented new songwriter..Sings very well,"This artist is very talented, and has a great ability to write songs. She's Got Eyes in the Back of her heart is one happy tune. All the music is great"
4,Just what I needed.,I needed a towel rack that could hold 3 towels with a skinny profile. This was sturdy and kept the towels apart so they could dry properly. Would recommend.
4,"Sturdy, good for small space","We bought this to fit a space behind a door in a small bath, and are very happy with it. It's exactly as pictured - three bars for towels plus a shelf at the bottom that gives it a lot of stability. Perfect for any small space."
2,Mediocre!,"This may be great for a psychologist that has his or her first bisexual client, after serving only monosexuals.Too many anthologies are catch-as-catch-can. You can tell how certain chapters go off topic that the editors were desperate for any contributions they could get. Here, however, clearly the editor had chapter ideas in mind and found writers that could follow through.Still, this book had competing flaws. At times, it states things obvious about bisexual concerns. Then other chapters were far too theoretically-high-falutin'. I wanted to send the chapter on bisexual, African-American men to some buddies, but it was all jargon and no beef. It may help the author get tenure somewhere, but it's otherwise useless.Books on bisexuality like ""Closer to Home"" and ""Bisexual Politics"" are excellent. This book just does not compete."
5,The Legal Guide for Individualized Education Programs,"You've heard the expression, ""He wrote the book on that."" Well, James N. Hollis wrote the book on proper legal procedures for Individualized Education Programs. His comprehensive guide groups legal procedures and recommendations by topic for quick and easy reference, including discipline issues, placement issues, goals and objectives, methodology, medical services, and assistive technology. Also, each section stands on its own, allowing you to skip portions not relevant to you.His book serves as a legal guide for teachers, school administrators, parents, and even lawyers. (The book includes legal citations.) His book is a must-have for those who want to ensure that their Individualized Education Program will stand up to legal scrutiny."
4,Great Prep Book,"This is a great book to prepare for the entry test to Catholic schools. My child used the review questions over and over to get a ""feel"" for the test questions. She aced the test and received early admission to the school of her choice."
1,Resell a workbook which has been used,I received the workbook which is fully used.I don't understand why there are people will sell back a fully marked workbook?!
1,Don't do it!,Book was required for a class. Worst book ever! Very hard for the lay person to follow. If I had purchased the actual paper copy it would have went out in the recycle bin. In no way was this purchase helpful.
1,What Not to Read,I had to order the book Models of the Church for a class. IT IS NOT WRITTEN IN LANGUAGE THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON CAN UNDERSTAND. I felt like I needed a degree in theology to read it. My advice don't buy the book- google the topics to find resources that are people friendly.
4,Soothing mellow house,"smooth house music, wanna relax? then just put this disk oni was amazed at the flawless transitions of first 1/2 hr of disk 1 .. very fluidi like the track ""got 2 b u"", funky bass and guitar make thisa great choice for a summer night outfor those who likes built up climaxing sound, explosive hard trance house and breaks beware.. you won't find thatas the name of the album suggests, this is a chill househowever, if you have an ear for let's say, the flavor of jazzy house from mark farina, or naked music from miguel migs,then you have another excellent house compilation."
5,One of the best Chill house cds from Cafe del mar,"For all ibiza and Cafe del mar lovers, this chill out is the last one of the 5 cds a good music lovers must have. What can I say, it is pure chill house for the terrace and the sun. I can't live without this collection. This volume is my favourite."
1,wrong item,I got the wrong product. The order is correct but somehow the selection system sent me the wrong CD. I did not pick this up until I played the product that's my mistake.The product that I selected was: V2 Cafe Del Mar Volumen Dos
2,Some good moments but mediocre on the whole,"This is almost a good movie. It has a statement to make(China's prisons are not the best place to be afterall) , a decent plot and an Oscar-worthing perfomance from Bai Ling as Richard Gere's chinese laywer.The problems begin with Gere's colourless acting and the directors obsession to make him stand out.It's silly to watch him use his right to defend himself in the chinese court.How can you believe that a common business man would have the guts and the brains to do that ? Then it's the producers fear not to let the chinese actors speak their mothertongue for more than five minutes.They somehow seem to be scared that if they do so , the audiences will be bored and leave the cinemas before the halfway mark.""I'm gonna tell you this in english in order not to humiliate you"" says Ling's character, to a chinese officer in some justice building full of files . Ok but...why?"
2,Don't believe what that you see here(severity to who resist),"An amusing way to think of movies like this - what if it was a Chinese buisnessman in the United States? The xenophobia of the Chinese in the movie, is just a reflection of the popular American view (which Hollywood is obliged to respect and re-enforce). American audiences will not see anything different, just the expected ""horned"" foreigners and the triumph of the ""white male"" over the other slithering slimy characters. And, of course, the reason why our hero is in the him vs. everyone in the movie because of trade issues. If you liked this movie, then you might want to try ""Rules of Engagement""However, credit must be given to the beautiful photography and the very textured and captivating music (and that's one start for each)"
3,International Gigolo,"Oh, the injustice of it all. China's legal system is just sooo unfair--what about our own system? Are the creators and stars of this film trying to say we actually have a better system? Does justice always prevail in America's democratic system? Seems to me, more times than not, it's pedaled out to the higher bidder. As a film, this is at best mildly entertaining and grossly predictable and preachy. And of course, Richard Gere is starring as Richard Gere. Which works since he's just so darn cute."
4,My stars are for Bai Ling,I haven't watched many of Bai Ling's American films other than Red Corner. I just saw her in Dumplings - Three Extremes and she is fabulous. It was sometimes disappointing seeing photos of Bai Ling in loud and revealing clothing so different from her subdued knockout style in Red Corner but Dumplings made me come around to appreciating Bai Ling regardless of what she is wearing and to even appreciate the beauty and talent she has to carry off some really wild outfits. She really is a very good actress. I think there are many ways to SELL yourself as a media product and she's a lot better than some of the professional girls next door in HK cinema who can NOT act. Bai Ling is willing to put aside personal concerns and to expose herself (not just physically) to do a good job and I hope Chinese filmmakers use her more. I would love to see her in more quality productions.
3,"Pretty Good, But Could Have Been Better.","""Red Corner"" is one of those films that gets it's message through, but not strongly enough. I expected a powerful drama like Alan Parker's ""Midnight Express."" But instead we get a thriller that's entertaining and interesting, but not as powerful as it should be. I recommend you see the film, it's message about Red China is pretty effective. Richard Gere gives a convincing performance. The score is also hypnotic. I also liked the visual work. While not a ""great"" film, ""Red Corner"" is still an effective film."
3,Bit Off More Than He Could Chew?,"Most of Greg Bear's ""Blood Music"" is pretty good: a good stretching of 1980s science, a really interesting idea, tight writing, interesting characters. But, the last part seems to devolve almost into a 1960s era drug-induced dream. It got to the point that, at the very end, I wasn't quite sure what had just happened. The writing technique also becomes a bit slack: the characters all seem to morph from their original unlikable selves into basically nice guys, the story changes from a technology focus to a touchy-feely focus, characters are introduced and removed for no reason, and there's quite a bit of irrelevant personal past history thrown in. I guess I'll have to say that the scope Bear's idea is so great that there really wasn't any way for him to tie things up. Still, if the ending hadn't slipped so much, I would have happily given this 4 stars. But, because it did, I'm reducing it to a merely OK 3 stars out of 5."
3,What a build up,"This book had so much potential when I first picked it up. It had many favorable science fiction conventions, but it gets lost somewhere in the end. I read this wonderful build up, but it turned out to be a major let down in the end, but this does make me want to read more of Greg Bear's stuff.The book itself was in good condition."
5,My favorite SF book of all time,"I've been reading SF since the 1960's and I've re-read this book 3 times. Bear takes a simple Frankenstein science moment and extrapolates it out into the the most extreme human singularity story imaginable. He seems to have fully considered every conceivable outcome of the idea of the uncontrolled release of intelligent microorganisms. Beginning with a basic disenfranchised bio researcher injecting himself with his own designer organisms, he explores all the human, physchological, physical, and ultimately metaphysical outcomes of that first moment.The conclusion is breathtaking and left me pondering the whole idea for several weeks.Bear's writing has certainly improved in the years since he wrote Blood Music, and the thinly outlined characters in this book are a tad annoying but the incredible evolution of his concept succeeds in overcoming this limitation. A must read!"
4,"""Blood Music"" gets under your Skin","As a recent convert to hard science fiction, and someone who was never really into reading fiction much at all, I can nevertheless recommend Bear as an intelligent, thought-provoking author. Some reviewers complain that he kills off so many interesting characters without resolution, but I think this approach actually contributes to the theme of the book.While not as important as another of Bear's bio-fictions, ""Darwin's Radio,"" ""Blood Music"" is a fast and entertaining read through a world gone *seriously* awry.When the bacteria started talking, I couldn't stop smiling.(One part of the book that new readers should be warned of: there is a scene takes place inside the World Trade Center. It was actually pretty difficult for me to read, as Bear put his characteristically strong research skills into that section, and described the stairwells, etc, with excruciating accuracy.)"
2,Unfocused Virus Story,"""Blood Music"" has a cool premise about a bizarre, self-aware virus that spreads across the United States and communicates with its human hosts, but it sadly never really works.For one thing, there are WAY TOO MANY characters to keep track of. We don't care about too many of them, because (1)We don't spend enough time with them and (2)They die too quickly.The story moves at an incredibly slow pace, when it should be moving like a rocket. I don't mean to sound impatient, but a story like this deserved a faster pace.This book should have been tighter and more character-driven (with fewer characters). The story is too dull to complement its premise. All that promise from the premise was wasted. Oh well."
1,Glaahhh!!! They published this pile of bupkus?,"I only made it seventy pages before I couldn't read any more. I tried to skim another 70 pages but I couldn't even stand that. This is bar none, the WORST sci-fi novel I've ever read."
1,Loss of identity is GOOD for you!,"Don't be misled by the utopian aspirations of the climax; BLOOD MUSIC is little more than fascist propaganda in disguise. All flaws are removed, all imperfections are eliminated, and everyone has become one big, happy family of mutant muck. Adolf and Josef would have embraced the concept of the noosphere with open arms. In some regards, BLOOD MUSIC is similar to a fan-written STAR TREK novel that tries to depict the Borg as the good guys.Filled to the brim with unlikeable characters, a clunky narrative, and the final, vile message that turning down the chance to be ""assimilated"" is ultimately wrong, even foolish, Mr. Bear really, REALLY should have known better."
3,I've read better; I've read worse...,"I think much of the comments provided by other readers are accurate and sum up pretty clearly the strengths (and weaknesses) of the book. Intriguing concept and frightening but plausible possibilities. Terrific and horrifying ideas about what things could be like. However, the lack of any real or sympathetic characters is a definite drawback. I think the book isn't reflective of the true capabilites of Greg Bear as his other works are much better."
2,Expansion of a great short story into an overlong novel,"The original short story was wonderfully written and lead to a plausable and chilling conclusion. The novel expanded the story and altered it with additional material which, to my estimation, seriously detracts from the impact and interest of the original. Just my opinion."
4,Interesting variant on biodisaster thriller.,"A sloppy scientist creates blood cells that are able to think and alter their enviroment, which is the human body. Things get hairy when the little devils get loose and begin infecting the world. Most of this novel is intriguing, but it falls apart at the end (no pun intended), but the ideas and concepts (especially in light of recent nanotech advances) make it worth reading once or twice. Recommended."
3,"Not quite visionary, not quite SF.","Despite the votes wildly in favor of this book (by net.rabid.greg-bear.weenies like eelrat), I have to agree with the minority voice here.Flaws in the book are: 1. Where is the plot? 2. Where are the character developments?I am not saying this is a BAD book (I've read much worse) and I am not sure that it qualifies as real SF, but seriously folks, let's all decaffinate before posting rabid reviews in either direction."
4,Good book - Iffy Publisher,"The book was great, but the publisher was kinda cheap. They saved costs by not reviewing the book, in any way at all, for spelling errors... which are rampant. Not just little errors, like a switched vowel, I mean serious word failures. Many times I had to *stop reading* and figure out what they were trying to say because I wasn't even sure the thing in question was a word at all. The book also has problems with missing periods and missing quotation marks (you will just run into a lone quotation mark out of nowhere, and have to figure out where its match should go, this happened often).So, overview: Great book, don't hesitate to buy it if you like sci-fi. You might want to look into a different publisher though if you don't want to deal with the errors."
1,No no no!,"Bought this for my 1998 Honda Civic Si when the power antenna broke. Fitment was poor, the hold down bolt for the mast was missing so the entire thing popped out and none of the heads fit the rear fender for mounting. This antenna is in the landfill now. This may work for a truck or SUV where the antenna it mount on the top of the front panel."
4,yummy!,"This caramel corn is very good, and the packaging ensures it will stay fresh. Priced too high for what it is, though."
3,Sugary but not really carmel,Was hoping for lotsa nuts and real carmel. Was lots sugar with some nuts. Still delicious My husband uses them for a sugar rush after his 50k weekend bike rides
3,A solid general reference on an obscure battle.,"_Otterburn 1388_ offers a solid general reference on this border battle between Scottish and English forces during the middle of the Hundred Years War. The section on the battle itself is hampered by a lack of information in the historical record. However, the introductory sections give a thorough background on the border conflict, going all the way back to Stirling Bridge and Falkirk ninety years before. The concluding sections are equally thorough, including a chapter and a map on the battle of Humbleton Hill a decade later involving many of the same combatants. Peter Armstrong does not have the academic credentials of some of the other medieval Osprey authors, such as David Nicolle, yet he covers the material with the detail of a professional in addition to the enthusiasm of a learned amateur."
4,interesting overview of a long forgotten battle,"Once again, Ospery Campaign series bring us some detail and interesting account of a battle that 99% of American public probably never heard of. Peter Armstrong's book proves to bring some insight into this battle that remains a basic unknown for most readers. Thanks to lack of primary sources, the author had to make some educational conjectural accounts. But I found the details of the battle and the campaign to be pretty well put together and the summarized account of the entire English-Scottish border warfare that goes back to Walliam Wallace to be pretty well put together.The major elements I thought the book was weak in was in the map area. I didn't see much use for the maps which appears to be bit confusing and not all that well put together.But overall, I thought this was a pretty good effort by Ospery to bring to light one of the more interesting but truly forgotten battles of the Middle Ages."
4,You can't take it with you,"This book was full of interesting stories about a woman who was pretty amazing for the time period she lived in. She did so well financially, and yet was so cheap in her every day life. It's interesting when you discover what ultimately happens to her fortune. It was a good reminder to me of what is really important in life. . . and it's not money. You can't take it with you"
3,A good buy if you are into the genre,"I was first exposed to Definition of Sound on the Freestylers album ""We Rock Hard"" where they were featured on my favorite track, Here we Go. If you are expecting that kind of sound on Definition of Sound's album ""Experience"" you will be disappointed. The album is definitely more mellow, but it has its own great songs. Boom Boom, Pass the Vibes, and Experience stand out as the strongest tracks. If you are a fan of electro-R&B, this album is a good buy."
5,Solid disc,"This disc comes in a cone-shaped design; that is, the edge along the circumference sticks out an inch further than the center. This makes it easier and perhaps more ergonomical to dig in a bit with the edge of the disc for faster material removal; however, it hinders/prevents smooth finish grinding by laying the disc flat. So there's a tradeoff to consider, but I would imagine most people choosing a 9 inch grinder over a smaller tool are more concerened with time than aesthetics anyways."
3,Wow?,I upgraded my computer with the SB live and connected it to my Stereo system and it really rocks!!! but in the other hand my last sound card - has surround capabilites and 3d sound and it cost about 70$ and if you will put those two systems in comparison you will probably won't hear a diffrence. If you already have a sound card with 4 speaker output dont buy it!
5,Fog juice,Wonderful during Halloween we scared the crap out of the kids it was well worth it to watch them mystified
3,Average,This product arrived in good condition. You need double the dose per gallon in order to get a good smelling effect. You can barely smell the scent with just one bottle per gallon.
2,Not smelly,"Well, it smells better than the typical burning smell that a fog machine has. However, definitely does not smell like vanilla. I used the recommended dosage, nothing. Doubled the recommended amount. Still nothing. I'm going to try some other scents, like strawberry, and see if those are more potent."
5,"""That Which Passes"" is Soundscapes BRILLIANCE!","Robert Fripp has always been a force dealing with improvisation and reaching out for new and uncharted musical territory. ""That Which Passes"" explores his Soundscapes concept in practice while investigating death and ""passing"" in theory and intent. Not structured tunes in any conventional sense, but rather complex musical structures created by one brilliant musician, his guitar and a multitude of electronic gear. It is captivating, hypnotic at times, very atmospheric and perfect for active or passive listening. This is my personal favorite in the Soundscapes series."
4,A little light on the subject,"Well, not really a review.... But to correct a recent review on Amazon. The movie is now called, ""Drive me Crazy"" Featuring Melissa Joan Hart(taking over the Silverstone role) The sound track has the title song from Britney Spears (Melissa & the male lead are featured in the video, they are the ones at the raw juice bar & at the DJ's table), it's getting heavy rotation on Mtv's TRL. Movie will be out next Friday(Oct 1st.), with the sound track due out Sept 28th! And also, the ONLY way to get the song(since it's a remix) is from the soundtrack! However there is a import of it, good luck finding it! Also, there is a auction for it here on Amazon."
3,a bit disappointing,"Though it was what I expected: an easy read, the story was sweet but fell a little flat towards the end. The depth behind the characters was plausible, but while the book is predictable from the beginning the end doesn't quite live up to what you wish would happen with the characters."
4,A Good start for a new character,"It was refreshing to see a break from the Burke series: the new character of Walker Dett and the time in which this novel takes place is a good jumping on point for new readers. I found the novel very enjoyable. While still not as good as my favorite Andrew Vachss story (The Getaway Driver) this still managed to hold my interest. If you are new to reading Andrew Vachss purchase either this or ""The Getaway Driver"" and you will not be disapointed. To learn more about the author you can visit his website."
3,slow train,"A much more wordy effort, with a lot less payoff. The minute by minute style gets old fast."
2,Big disappointment for a big Vachhs fan,"I've read most of the Burke series of books at least twice. This book was very disappointing. I think he tried to cover too many bases, and ultimately nothing seemingly happens. This is one of those books when you get to the end you say, ""Is that it?"" Not sure why the time stamp was so important since there was never any real climax or denouement to the book. I'll still read his books, but wouldn't recommend this one.Greg Ingram"
1,Don't Bother!,"If you read Vachss for his Burke series, don't bother with this long-winded and ultimately pointless disappointment! I couldn't even finish it (which is EXTREMELY rare for me) - the endless dialogue finally put me to sleep. Really - don't buy it! Save your money for the next Burke novel!"
4,New Territory for Vachss - Might Take One More to Get it Right,"The prose, characterizations, and plotting here are up to Vachss's usual high standards, but this is the first time Vachss has attempted, so far as I know, a sprawling, multi-POV, omniscient narration; his wielding of this new tool is a little clumsy. Vachss has been working in first person mode for a long time. He seems a little uncomfortable with the omniscient narration and consequently overuses the tool of dialog-as-exposition. But that more of a writer's complaint than a reader's. If you like a good noir crime story, this is well worth your time."
1,Hated it,"I have been reading Andrew Vachss' books for over a decade and have enjoyed the entire Burke series (although the earlier books were better than the later ones), but Two Trains Running did nothing for me.I found that the book was just too convoluted and trying too hard to do a James Ellroy in complexity of characters and depth. It just didn't come across well at all."
3,Had a lot of potential but...,"Vachss is one of my favorite writers, but ""Two Trains Running"" just does not work as a novel. It is actually about 6 stories running in parallel - and several of them just get left hanging without any apparent connection to the main story except that they happen in at the same time in the same town and involve many of the same people.I think this would have worked much better as a series of short stories sandwiched between a connected opening and ending piece. Vachss' deliberately choppy writing style works well for his Burke stories. But the fact that he constantly switches tracks with each section only serves to make an already complicated plot all but impossible to follow."
3,Continues Vachss' trend,"This novel continues Vachss' downward trend in recent novels. While his early work was tight paced and lead to a satisfying conclusion, Two Trains Running has tight pacing that goes nowhere fast.None of the characters are new, the fetishes and needs are all from the same toolkit that Vachss has been using for years. On top of the characters being the same old riff, the story builds for 300 pages into an interesting skein of conflicting characters and motives, but ends in a rushed 50 or so pages that left me very unsatisfied. Many characters enter the story, become involved in a tangent, and then go away and have no real impact on the bigger story.If you are not an avid collector of Vachss in hard cover, but want to read all of his work, wait for the paperback."
2,Too many trains for me,"Get out your flowcharts, mystery fans. You'll need to track many, many characters and plot lines--some of which are simply left dangling at the end of the book.""Trains..."" is skillfully written here and there, but more work than fun to sit down and read. Brace yourself for the flat footed conversations between Dett, the anti-hero, and his small town girlfriend which go on forever. Where was the editor?Sex happens, yes, but it's too often complex and unenjoyable. Sporadic scenes of explosive violence--mainly at the end-- fail to animate a plodding and somewhat confusing story. And speaking of confusion, this is the second book called ""Two Trains Running"" to appear in the last year. Obviously it's a pretty good title; maybe all books should be called ""Two Trains Running."" Anyway, this is the one with individually dated paragraphs."
2,2 and 1/2 stars -- Slooooooow train to nowhere,"I've read several of the Burke novels. They have always held my interest -- even when they stretch credulity. This one (NO Burke) is a disappointment. The story starts off OK, but it soon bogs down as the plot widens and widens -- but never thickens. I quit after about 30% of the book. Way too many good books out there waiting for me to stick with this slowpoke."
5,Beautiful singing of beautiful songs by a real artist.,"This was my very first experience with this great performer,and I was immediatly smitten by her very unique voice and her sense of musical values. This lacks the intimacy of her I'll Be Seeing You album with its sense of the times and events of WW 2, but the beautiful music and her great sense of timing and diction make this a very special experience. You can't find such beautiful music so appealing performed,a master of the past being sung by the master singer of today. She is truly an artist for the lovers of good music in an age where there are very few of them."
3,"""A"" for effort","This is not a great book but I've got to give Paul Meier A LOT of credit for the attempt. I read just about every novel on biblical prophecy that comes out, and this is the only one I know of that takes that little bit of prophecy that exists about the time of the Millennial Kingdom of Christ and expands it into a full novel. So even though, like I said, it's not a great book, I recommend it. As for the period leading up to the Millennial Kingdom, I recommend THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY by James BeauSeigneur."
2,"Great Idea, poor execution","This story about the final days of Christ's millennial reign is certainly interesting. The authors have some creative ideas about what life may be like in that period. Unfortunately, they do not find creative ways to communicate these ideas. The characters are continuously saying things that should be obvious to their companions so the only point of most of the dialogue is to tell the readers what is going on. This makes for very awkward and forced conversations that leave no room for character development. The concept is great but this is a poorly written book hardly worth reading."
1,Bad Fiction,"I cannot get over how so much of Christian fiction is two dimensional. The characters are flat. The story is flat. In this particular case the absence of Jesus through the entire book is a bit bizarre. The idea that Jesus' main associates in the book have forgotten all the teachings of the Bible is really far out there in unbelievable land. The continual repition of how sleek and how advanced and how new all the technology is tedious at best, but left out you no longer have a novel length book."
3,Sweet but short,"If you're interested in Tom Wolfe, you may find this short 60 Minutes interview interesting, but it is short. The advantage is getting to see Wolfe with his tailor, walking down the streets of NYC in his dandy get-up, working in his home office, etc. As far as the interview material is concerned, it covers the same ground as theCharlie Rose interview from the about the same time period, but the Rose interview is in much greater depth and Wolfe opens up about his depression. Recommended? Eh...it's okay."
2,Meh,"Snare and bass drum hits can go places besides the downbeats. That's a pretty accurate summary of this book. It's a beginner's book aimed at people who want to go beyond American rock drumming (bass drum on 1&3, snare on 2&4). It wastes a lot of time with pictures and loose concepts, again, good for a beginner, but a waste of paper for everyone else. Opening yourself up to four-limb independence is the best way to interpret fast-pace beats, and this book doesn't have it. I'd recommend Marco Minnemann's book Xtreme Interdependence. Fantastic book not meant for the faint of heart, targeted towards intermediate drummers about to take the leap into four-limb drumming."
5,Great book!!!,It explains in a very clear way. I liked the way the grooves are constructed and explained.Totally recomendable for drummes that don't want to stay with the same grooves and give to their music a new taste.
4,Powerful!,"This album brought me to tears numerous times as I walked first hand with the characters surrounding the drama of the Passion through the music on this CD. The lyrics and the music complement eachother to bring a fresh perspective on the feelings of the people involved and afforded me fresh insight into some of the possible motives behind the actions of Judas Iscariot, Herod, etc. In addition, the lyrics helped to bring the characters alive. Peter and Mary were no longer names without faces, but real people living in the first century who had powerful emotions no different from my own. This recording is worth twice its price! It is definitely a one-of-a-king production."
3,Interesting but not a good book,"It's a little book. The first part is for the kindness of the stories. Then the authors present the story of the bird (too famous) and another stories. For two of them we need scissors or colouring pencil. The last story is ""the black cat"". Too famous too! I think the book is not the best."
1,Disappointed Kindergarten teacher,"I bought this book with the expectation that I would find many great ideas. I'm glad it's small, so it doesn't require a lot of space on my shelf because that is where it sits. I got two stories out of the book, one about a bird and one about a cat, that doesn't fit into the curriculum anywhere. However, I have used the stories to tell my class when the music teacher is running late as a quick filler."
2,disappointed,I am very disappointed with this purchase. I really was expecting more than just eight examples! And a couple of those were really brief - hardly anything I would use in my classroom. In fact I have found most of these stories already on the web.
4,"Good card, if you want both in one.","This card is excellent if you want both TV Tuner and Video in one, but if you want better gaming graphics I suggest you get a GeForce 4 TI4200 or higher and a TV Tuner card and use both of those. The Radeon is still a great card and you will get better output to your TV if you get the Radeon with an AGP port."
5,I really liked it!,"It was a very good book! But I don't think it is a very good idea to give girls to sneak out at night. Other than that it was a very, very good book!!"
5,Summertime!,"I liked this book. Kristy should have told the campers to leave her alone about makeup. Claudia likes a boy named Will, Mary Anne's campers try to perice her ears(Gross), Stacey gets poisen ivy, Dawn gets lost in the woods, and Jessi and Mallory can't do anything right. There's even two chapters about... Logan! Neat!"
3,Pretty good book.,"I liked the book,especially the part when Mary Anne writes the letter. But they should have used Mallory more. She had one chapter. It wasn't the greatest book I've read,but it's a pretty good read if your bored."
5,They are so SD!!,"I just saw them in concert with Audio Adrealine, and they rock. Their lyrics are cool and so is the music. I don't know much about them, but they can get to the soul with the message. Diffently a plus for everyone. Keep a going."
2,Repetitive Mediocrity,"I liked them ok at first, but the lyrics are so repetitive and the songs are mediocre at best. There is so much better Christian music out there, its a shame that people would limit themselves by thinking they must limit themselves to subpar talent to get the Christian message."
4,a good album from a promising new trio in CCM modern rock...,"With intensely catchy tunes like 'Verb', 'Billboards', 'Credit Card' and ""The Great Alaskan Ninja' the best thing about this record is that it hints that even better material is to follow. With some maturity, Silage may be soon mentioned in the same breath as DC Talk as one of the great trios in CCM. The 311 thing is definately there, (I'll give you that) but who cares. Silage are too fun to allow you to take them seriously. Keep an eye on them though as well as Mukala, All Star United and the rest of the Essential Records batting order."
4,Different but still good,"Silage is a band that started in my hometown. I've seen their music change dramatically throught the years. This latest album rocks!, but I do miss their old sound. I don't care for the heavy rap mix, I think they should stick with the orignal unquie style they played on the Watusi album. You gotta love them, though!, I feel they have lyrics that relate to everyones christian walk, they are a great ministrie!!"
2,"The first two songs are good, but that's it.","I saw them live w/ Jars of Clay, and their songs ""Original"" and ""Yo Tengo"" got utterly stuck in my head. Naturally I ordered the album, and boy was I disappointed. These boys are trying to pull some kind of 311 type act and it just is not working. Not good by any standards."
5,Writing is more of an exact science than I thought,"Using The Revision Process as a guide, I went back thru the first two chapters of a book I have been ""working on"" for several years and rewrote them almost completely. What a difference! The setting and the characters are really coming to life. The word count is down and the action is more concise and faster moving. Can't wait to get to the rest of my novel and have already joined a small writer's group to share critiques and ideas."
1,A cat in the sack!,"Athough I am a keen reader of Janwillem van de Wetering's books, I can not recommend on this one. The novel consists of a miserable attempt at writing an international suspence roman and is hardly worth the paper it is printed on.The copy I read was published in Dutch, which is one of the two original languages in which van de Wetering writes all his books. At that time his command of Dutch was still better than his English, later this swopped.Though I have stuck it in my precious collection of van de Wetering's books, I am afraid I will never read it again."
4,"Breves tópicos, Muchas ideas.","En este libro Fernando Savater escribe muchos pequeños ensayos sobre algunos de los tantos libros que ha leido. Los topicos son muy variados, desde la alegria, pasando por los caospolitas hasta filosofía y ciencia ficción. Hay que leer cuidadosamente pues es un texto que resume las grandes ideas de muuchos libros y muchas vidas. En este tomo se ve a un Savater algo Spinozista y claro cuando es pertinente deja entrever su opinion y su favoritismo a ciertas ideologias. Es un buen libro, es culturalmente enriquecedor y hace darnos cuenta que hay aun taanto por leer!"
5,Browns never sounded better,"I've been a fan of the Browns for many years /40 at least/, ever sincetheir recording of Margo. I happened to see this CD listed for them as Iwas looking for a similarly titled album by Willie Nelson. I just had toget a copy and am I ever glad I did. Some of the mixing is a little weak,but otherwise it's OK. One of the best trios ever and this is one of their better recordings."
3,"3 and 1/2 Stars...Short, Sweet, Shallow","As a young teenager, I discovered Mary Higgins Clark's first thriller ""Where are the Children?"" I was hooked. Although Clark has never been exceptionally deep or thought-provoking in her novels, she never fails to entertain. Her writing is concise and quick-moving, her plots full of intrigue and suspense.I picked up ""Kitchen Privileges"" hoping for insight into Clark's background and the foundations of her writing career. In typical fashion, she skims through the decades of her long and rich life with entertaining anecdotes and brief glimpses of grief. She never fails to keep the pages moving, but she left me feeling like I'd waited for a five-course meal and discovered some tasty appetizers instead.If you are a diehard Clark fan, you'll enjoy this opportunity to understand her a bit more. She gives us her life story in the same manner she gives us a fictional work--short, sweet, and not particularly filling. I was hoping for something deeper."
4,Kitchen privilieges,I enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and entertaining. It kept my interest until the end. A very moving story.
4,An interesting memoir,"I have not read many of Mary Higgins Clark's books ~~ it's not because I don't like her writing ~~ I do ~~ it's that I don't normally read a lot of mysteries. However, after reading this memoir, I am tempted to read more of her books since she is such an interesting writer. Her life is just as interesting as some of the books I have read!Clark comes across as a woman of vital strength and character ~~ which is what you don't normally hear about these days. Her growing up years were tough but very interesting. Her recollections are also inspiring. And she also throws in a dash of humor every now and then. She is also a blunt writer ~~ honest about everything including herself.If you like memoirs, this book is an excellent choice to pick up! It gives an insight into America's favorite author and her lives. Instead of being a diva, Mary Higgins Clark is one of us.5-18-03"
4,Who would have thought?,"This is a really great and easy read. For those who love ""America's #1 Mystery/Suspence writer"", what a chance to find out who she is. Going from the child with out a father to working for PanAm, to now being a household name. I think that everyone could only dream about a life that has been this full. Although a great deal of loss has been put upon her, she has kept moving forward when her world should probably been paused. I would tell everyone to read this just to keep your own life pointed toward the positive."
4,"Actually, The Book Gets a 3 1/2","I enjoyed reading about Ms. Clark's life and about her experiences.Her life has taken many turns in her time on this earth. But, the book held no excitement or anything that made me want to read on to find out what happens next. The book was good if the reader wants to know only facts and not be entertained at the same time."
4,Captured by Kitchen Privileges,I find this enormously entertaining and I am fascinated by autobiographies. This is a great book!!
5,Overlooked But Solid Randolph Scott Western,"""Coroner Creek"" was the first Western of Randolph Scott to be produced by Harry Joe Brown, and although overlooked, it heralded the outstanding Ranown Productions Westerns that marked the high point of his career and some of the best Westerns that Hollywood has ever produced.This film follows the pattern used in the Ranown films - loner, laconic hero who is bent on revenge, on a long lonely quest to find the object of his revenge, has women falling in love with him, a brutal fistfight with a villain (in this one, Forrest Tucker, who was his adversary in several other films), and finally a reckoning.This film wasn't directed by Budd Boetticher, but Ray Enright's direction, the cast (including Marguerite Chapman, George Macready, and Edgar Buchanan), and good writing makes Coroner Creek a worthy predecessor for Scott's future films."
4,Great for freeing up outlets.,"if you travel a lot, this is a good thing to have, plus it's smaller than the charger that comes with it."
5,Another Eurodance CD!!,"This CD is VERY underrated, maybe because it's not a US release. Not a song matches up to ""I Wanna Be Your Toy"" or ""Bad Girl"" but that does not matter. One thing I did NOT like was the way the organ is the SAME on ""Move Your Body"" ""Oh La La La"" and ""Din-Ge-Lin-Ge-Ling."" However, it is a good album. ""Din-Ge-Lin-Ge-Ling"" is like a Christmas song with it's chorus. ""B.I.T.C.H."" is where they go bitchy and saucy, which is nice. ""Bailando y Cantando"" is an ABBA like song, such as ""One Of Us"" or ""Our Last Summer."" The Latin mix of ""Move Your Body"" is better than the original, same with the S-M mix of ""Oh La La La."" I think that ""Open Your Eyes"" and ""Shattered Dreams"" are beautiful, inspirational songs. All in all: A good effort by a nice European group."
4,excellent,"In the 60s, jazz had two seperate streams flowing into the same river: free jazz and soul jazz. Idiotically, critics took sides, as if both these types of beautiful music were mutually exclusive. Tonight's card, Jimmy Smith vs. Cecil Taylor, 15 rounds. Then again, in those days, everything was polorized. Music, like hair and dress, was politics.This is fortunately no longer the case, and if you like soul jazz, look no further than this album. McCann and Harris create a tight, rocking R&B; that is both danceable and ellgent. This is not a organ romp one off, but polished, well-composed music with outstanding players. Grit and gloss to every note. Great vocals.It also works as an album. There is not a sliver of filler on here.If you like soul jazz, buy this. Then again, if you like free jazz, buy this."
4,Groovy Vibes,"This CD has some pretty groovy tracks on it, typical of it's era, and these two are masters of their Art. There's sure to be at least two or three tunes here to be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates funky, groovy music."
4,comfortable shirt,"I agree with the previous reviewer - shirt is nice & soft. Relatively thin material. Necklace is plastic. It is sewn onto the shirt at the bottom of the V-neck, and attached to small loops of fabric near the shoulders. If you remove the necklace the loops of fabric stick out.I bought myself the wrong size. I usually wear Small (34A chest), but for some reason bought a Medium, and it's too big. I'd suggest buying the size you normally wear."
2,CUTE LITTLE CURIOUSITY...BUT HARDLY A TOP MUSICAL,"PIGSKIN PARADE was a modest little collegiate B-musical made at Fox in 1936 boasting Jack Haley and Patsy Kelly as its biggest stars. Fox made several musicals that year which are far better, and much more entertaining.We'll probably never see them on DVD.But we've got PIGSKIN PARADE selected for DVD because it features the film debut of the wonderful Judy Garland who plays a minor supporting role, and gets to sing a few entertaining numbers. Also on hand is a 20 year-old Betty Grable, who was still about 4 years away from becoming a star, and having to stumble through middling pictures like this in between.For Garland or Grable completists, this is an obvious buy...but others will likely be better off spending their money on a better movie."
3,Pigskin Parade,"This is one of those films with a few scenes vividly remembered from bygone days. Generally speaking, the movie was pure corn. Patsy Kelly was about as funny as a violent head cold and the phony musical numbers smelled. Even Judy Garland bombed.Nevertheless, it's worth watching now and then for nostalgic reasons."
1,Wrong Item Details,Details lists for a 1 1/16 inch sway bar. It is actually for a 11/16 bar. Please correct detail info.
2,What you get for the cheapest price,"This tube is cheaply made and flimsy, which is just about right for the price. The plastic is weak and I wouldn't trust it in any kind of travel situation. And the telescoping mechanism that is supposed to lock in place doesn't."
4,Good,Does the job. I went to several places with this tube in different countries. I checked the tube as luggage on the airplane. No problems.
4,Excellent History and Insightful,"The Number is an excellent history of the stock market and what drove it up to about 2007. I recommend this book to any investor. It gives keen insights into what makes the market move. Those insights are as true today as when it was written. But, the writing style is a bit weak, almost high schoolish. This isn't because the writer is targeting a less intelligent reader / investor, but because he cannot write well. I think this is because of the writer's background as a magazine article writer rather than a book writer. Again, though, this is a must read for any investor."
4,"trippy, makes you question wall street","this book was an interesting read, and tripped me out at some points. The guy definitely did his research."
2,Nothing really new here,"I can see why Berenson is touted as one of the top authors under 30. His writing is great. Crisp, clear, well researched and understandable.However, if you have kept up with all the shenanigans going on in the market over the past years, there is very little new here. Folks who are not as in touch with the details behind the financial chincary that has gone on will find this a quick, enlightening and enjoyable read.I would love to see the author tackle another topic in the future."
1,The Number,A book about accounting written by a nonaccountant. A waste of your time and money. My copy went into the trash.
3,"I bought this because my child is a runner. With this on, he still tries to run, and with one strong jerk on his part, the harne","I bought this because my child is a runner. With this on, he still tries to run, and with one strong jerk on his part, the harness just comes apart. It's only held together by Velcro."
1,Sure Steps Walking Harness/NOT RECOMMENDED,This harness was fastened with velcro which would not hold my three year old Grandson. It was off in under a minute.
3,It's a great product to keep a very active child in check. The only drawback is that the velcro can partially come undone.,"My daughter just turned 2, and she loves to run. As soon as her feet touches the ground, she takes off. The harness comes in handy so that she can have a little freedom while I keep her close. The only problem is that if she tries to pull away with too much force, the velcro starts to come undone."
5,Great for the price!,I recently flew alone with my 3 children and these were lifesavers!I used the harness on the baby. And the wriststraps (included) on the older ones. Noone tried to take them off and we made it safely across the country!
2,You get what you pay for!,"This was a cheaper option compared to other types of safety straps, and I'd say it's just OK. The straps are very stiff and kinda rough, especially the parts that rub against his neck. It actually left red marks on my son's neck. :( I put some strap covers on so that helped greatly. But the thing is such a pain to put on and take off, cause you have to slip one arm through, then the child's head, and then the other arm. It's a little awkward.It did help me keep my son from running away from me, and when he tripped and fell, it kept him from hitting the ground cause I yanked him right up! I have since decided to spend a little more money and get a more comfortable safety strap: Eddie Bauer Harness Buddy - Monkey I love this monkey so much!!! Soft, slips on and off like a book-bag, cute, and my son loves the monkey! I would recommend spending a little extra for comfort!"
4,Definitely useful,"I got this for my 2 year old because I also have an infant (3 month old) that is either in the stroller or the baby bjorn, so it is vital that my 2 year old stay close to me when we are out and about because I don't have the freedom to give her all my attention of to run after her because of the infant. It has been so useful and my 2 year old loves taking walks with me. Sometimes I wish the strap were a little longer, but it works fine enough. You also have to be sure to securely fasten the velco, which is substantial, but if they pull real hard it could come lose. I definitely recommend it, especially for city dwellers like myself."
3,sure steps safety harness,It was ok butt it is limited on sizes for a child if you have a big 2 year old it might not fit.
3,CHECK for the sizing. Quality is good,"This harness says it will work on children within a specific size/weight, however, I find it is TOO SMALL. The quality is very good!! It is very sturdy, if you have a strong child or a child with Autism (or other disability), it is a great tool! But please check the sizing for the product"
3,Just OK,"I got this for my granson and he hates it, not because he doesnt want to wear it but because it's stiff and uncomfortable. I ended up just using the ""cord"" part around his hand or his belt loop. This seems to work fine.We call it his ""love handle"" and tell him we love him and don't want him to get lost, he buys that, hook, line and sinker!"
1,Great design but one major flaw.,"I purchased this product for one good reason. There is no bear or duck or a backpack on the back side.The reason we wanted this product was that my 2 year old kid was gona travel with my wife alone. I thought I could just let him wear the harness through out the travel and so the toys on the backside would not bother him, plus the cost $6 was worth a try.But, the lower strap that goes around the abdomen is secured by Velcro. We put it on and it took him less then 20 sec to take the Velcro off. We put it again and then again it comes off.This was unsafe, this product only gives a feeling of security but it will not hold all the time."
2,Not safe,"This product has a Velcro strap. We have a 15 month old girl and when falling, we coud hear the strap loosen... Not safe."
1,"Item broke right out of packing, not even used.","We ordered this item to keep track of our toddler how now refused to be carried or put in the stroller. We took it out of the package and adjusted it to fit our toddler. We held the wrist strap and it immediately broke--even before he or the parent started moving. It appears that the handle portion of the item (that the parent holds) had been improperly sewn. As a result, that loop was not secured. We contacted Amazon and the offered us a refund, which we gladly took. We will not be purchasing this item again."
4,good strap,"We haven't used it much yet. In the begining our little one was uncomfortable with it, but we started to make a fun game with it. Now he seems to enjoy it."
1,very unsafe,this product had a Velcro strap. if your child falls it could be dangerous. get a better product with a buckle
1,DANGEROUS,First time I tried it with my babyfell to the floor even when I was trying to keep him standing in his feet and then straps can not support the baby's weight so he got unstrapped. Not likely to use it ever again.
1,amazing way to put a leash on my child!,"this is such a great idea! my child doesn't like holding hands or being told what to do, so if i want to leave the house with him, i have to tie him to me. works great! not sure what i'll do as he gets older. maybe when he's a teenager, they'll have a version made out of chain. that would be so awesome! wow, what a great idea!"
4,Good Stuff,"I really enjoyed this movie. I had never even heard of it. When my friend put it in and I started watching I thought I knew exactly where it was headed and thought it was going to be a standard formula. This happened about 3 times thru the entire movie and everytime I was fooled and suprised. By the end I really was suprised and I really found that I enjoyed this movie. It was refreshing that somebody can and will take chances and break the usual hollywood formula. Robin Wright Penn, the only person I had heard of in the movie, was just great. Everybody else in it was great too but I have know idea who they are."
2,Rediculous cliche film,"This film is so full of cliches and rediculous scenes that it makes one want to cry. The 'religious' Syrian Muslim man grabbing dogs and allowing alcohol in his house, his uncovered sister in law who looks and speaks french, the screaming white women who is really 'crazy' and allows herself to be molested and beaten and that takes part in self mutilation. This is just a rediculous film that in its weak attempts to 'explode prejudice' and 'deal with 9/11' fails miserably.The director evidently felt that by making the film complicated and giving it 'twists and turns' and trying to be unpredictable that this would solve the problem of the characters, neither of which are realistic or honest. The only thing slightly honest is that the 'religious' Muslim wants to marry the western businesswoman and that she in turn is inticed by her own racist orientalism.Seth J. Frantzman"
4,"""Are we really there, yet...?"" ( Unfortunately, some probably are.)","An indelible, psychological drama -- that pulls you in, and never lets go.Twists and turns like a mountain highway, and right on the edge, with no guard rails. Unfortunately, the title of this film is a tragedy; it is as enticing to want to watch as a cup of stale tea. It really needed a better one. And I really would never have watched it, had I not gotten two copies for resale... and being disappointed that the going prices were so low, I was considering giving it away instead. Then, having a bit of insomnia, I thought it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. Whoa... what a surprise. It pulled me in. And I can easily see this becoming a sort of slow, steady ""cult"" favorite over time. The word needs to get around."
2,"Sorry, indeed...","Inconsistant, but it does keep you riveted to your seat. Robin Wright Penn has her moments in this film, and those moments are pretty creepy. However, this film was entirely unfocused and awkward at times, and while it attempted to be unique and original, this subject matter has been explored before in other films...and with much better results, I might add. The ending is one BIG cliche. See only for Robin Wright Penn's performance."
3,Interesting Idea,"Not sure what to make of this movie. The plot is good and has its twists and the end catches you off guard kind of.the idea of channeling your anger into something destructive is portrayed in a good way. Terrorism can come from any kinds of frustration be it religious, emotional or just the mere feeling of injustice.However you get the feeling that it was filmed using someone's video camera and with no settings at all. Maybe that's what makes the movie even more realistic."
2,Far fetched.,"The premise is brilliant, but poor executed.Anyways, good acting by Robin Wright(Phoebe) as the crazy white lady. Can people be that evil? I'm sure they can be- but it is very,very rare. My advice to cabbies: Its OK to talk to your customers, especially crazy young women-They probably wont be out to kill you.I couldn't take the movie in a single sitting-which is a bad sign for any movie.sorry 2 stars. Great acting by all actors, though!"
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME...GREAT BOOK!,"I've read so many books about 'actual events' or 'true stories' and they never really measure up to what I think is the ""truth"".This book was different---it's about time I read a good one! I was glued to this book for hours."
2,THIS IS NOT A FINISHED BOOK,"Although this book has some interesting tidbits and insights into LeTourneau, there needs to be more. The book needs to be fleshed out with vivid descriptions of the prison itself, the guards, the conditions, the daily grind. We aren't left with a clear picture of what any of these women are going through. For instance, Mary goes to the ""Hole"" for months as punishment but there is not one word about what it is like. The reader is left to imagine it, and for those of us who haven't been incarcerated that is hard to do.It is over 240 pages only because the Print On Demand publisher took such liberal spacing in-between paragraphs.This could have been a GREAT book if a legitimate mainstream editor/publishing house had gotten involved and pushed the author to give us more. I criticize the publishing houses but now I see why authors shouldn't self-publish."
4,Mass with Mary,"I found this book incredibly interesting - I couldn't put it down. It seemed to be written so honestly and without any angles or bias. Simply a true account of the events that took place behind those prison walls. I always prefer reading true stories, but this is one of the truest accounts I've written in the form that it's been published in. I'd bet a movie comes out of this one! Good read."
5,WHAT A BOOK!!!! EXCELLENT!!!,"This was the most unusual book I may have ever read. Dress wrote down random thoughts and insight that became a vital part of the story as a whole. VERY DIFFERENT, VERY GOOD READING.The parts about Mary Kay were good, but the prison story itself and the lives of Dress and Johnson were of interest to me and I'd enjoy reading more. My vote is for another book!AdrienneMiami, Florida"
4,Classical Brass Classic,This album is a wonderful representation of composers who studied or were otherwise influenced by Giovanni Gabrieli and is well performed by Irvin Wagner and the Stuttgart Brass Quartet.
4,Nice set of songs,"If you enjoy eclectic acoustic instrumental music, you should have this in your collection. Good sunday morning cup-of-coffee music."
2,"There are two groups named ""Gitbox""","Don't make the same mistake I did and confuse this with the group Gitbox! who released the album ""Last Night I Dreamt of Gary Indiana"". It's not the same group...If you're into world music and like the light backgroup guitar, then you'll like this, but I think it's just not interesting enough to listen to with my full attention. They try to be jazzy, but can't really swing, try to be classical, but not really there either."
5,Works as expected,"Received the battery quickly, is was the best price including shipping I could find, and works as good as the original did when it was new."
2,make sure you know what you're ordering,"I've read several other Beth Mooore books and heard her speak many times. She is an excellent (and contagious) Bible teacher. When I ordered this item I was unaware it was a ""workbook"" I thought it was a chapter book. This is a workbook that belongs with a ""Bible study kit"" that has 6 teaching DVDs, it's basically part of a Bible study curriculum. I don't recommend you order this workbook alone. I'm too lazy to return it and (since it's Beth Moore) I know I will find nuggets of gold without the teaching DVDs. Hope my comment helps you."
5,Wonderful,"As always, Beth takes us on a wonderful journey, where we cannot just only, get closer to the bible characters, but also to God. This bible study shows God's mercy, and provision, and also His sovereignty, and His providence.I've done all of her bible studies, and I am always amazed how much she loves the Lord, but the attention is not on her, but on her God. It is a wonderful journey through the book of Genesis."
2,Grieved at heart,"Just finished the lessons on ""Patriarchs"". So sad to see the portrayal of Joseph. My ladies class was ""led"" by the instruction of Beth Moore. In the end the concenses was that we are all just ""human"". What opportunities were missed to teach some beautiful truths about the life of Joseph. Instead we received a description that Joseph was ""a brat"" (scripture only says he obeyed his father and gave reports as his father asked). Joseph wore a coat provided by his father--that makes him a brat? He was given dreams that were prophecy and did ""share"" with the wrong people. He is also portrayed as out of control and vindictive. Beth does say she does not agree with several commentators. If you are going to take a stand against accepted knowledge, I think you should have scriptures to back up your portrayal. I think Beth missed this one, and gave excuses to those who choose to see flaws in others in order to walk a sloppy walk themselves."
5,Powerful!!,"This is my first Beth Moore. I've heard of her for about 2 years. I'm taking with about 30 other women. We finished week 6 yesterday. There was not a dry eye in the house after the video. This is THE most powerful Bible study I've ever done. And it's our ancestors. And they are as screwed up as I am! And God still talks to them. Thank you Beth from the bottom of my heart - I feel healing and love every week. I can't wait to do the homework, takes 1-2 hours a week, and can't wait to get to group on Mondays. Please continue this work."
1,Poor Choice,"Beth Moore doesn't know what to do with the OT. She discovers a few moralisms (""life lessons"") and a few spiritual principles, but she does not understand covenant or the Christ centered nature of OT revelation.Although she is aware that some see Joseph as a symbol of Christ, she rejects the idea. She sees him as self centered, emotionally conflicted, out of control, a liar and a drunk.Beth Moore is a great entertainer but not a good Bible teacher. I would not recommend this book."
3,Decent but better choices exist. Incompatibility problems!,"The X-Gamer is a very decent card. Pretty good sound quality. DVD's play okay, games are okay, the only thing that's really great about the card is the sound quality in DOS but not a lot of people have applications in DOS. For the same price, there are many better choices out there currently which have much better sound quality in recording and playback.Also, the SB Live! cards have problems working on motherboards with VIA southbridge chipsets and many AMD-based motherboards have a VIA southbridge. The IRQ settings get messed up and the only way to get the card working is to upgrade and install the 4-in-1 drivers."
5,Must have for games or DVD,"Wire this baby into your stereo, and you'll definitely notice the difference between good sound cards and the bad ones. This card is excellent although it is a little expensive due to the market strength of sound blaster. The included games give this package a little more value. The digital output is great if you have the equipment for it. At maximum volume, I don't even notice distortions (of course you need your speakers to perform too)."
4,Very Good Sound Card For DVD Play back,have being using this sound card with my pentium 4 the sound is very good you have to have a ALTEC LANSING SPEAKERS TO ENJOY THE GREAT 5.1 PLAYBACK. WHEN YOU PUT THE SPEAKERS ALL THE WAY LOUD YOU COULD HEAR STRANGE SOUNDS BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME IF YOU HAVE A GOOD COMPUTER AND A GOOD VIDEO CARD THIS SOUND CARD WILL BE GREAT AND THIS SOUND CARD IS ONE OF THE BEST I WAS WATCHING XMEN THE OTHER DAY SOUND WAS VERY CLEAR AND THE EFFECTS WERE GREAT I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A THEATER...
4,FMS People - Check it out,"My Physical Therapist at a local Portland, OR hospital is using these techniques. I went assuming the same old PT, where it would HURT, and I would leave in pain.No way - this therapy is so great for Fibromyalgia, Back Pain, Arthritis, Bursitis - those are the ones I can speak to!I never heard of FeldonKrais before then, still can't spell it, but it really works. Read the book, and others."
3,Get the Case Logic CPS50,"It is everything more than this camera at a lower price if you have a Canon S30\40. The Caselogic bag is leather(ette) , has detachable straps, and you can secure it to your belt. The only exception is that you can fit a compact flash case in it and nothing more. The Caselogic because it is leather has a better feel and a more professional look to it for less. I've seen this Samsonite and didn't pick it up becase I found something else that better fit my Canon S40."
5,Great for HP Photosmarts,"Well aside from what has been said, I will say the velcro part could be annoying, however it is big and secure enough to make you feel safe for the avg user who wants just a camera and nothing more professional, has extra storage for batteries and your usb cable. All in all, better then nothing and good for the value. You wont feel the need to get rid of it anytime soon."
3,Mobstyle Muzik,"This cd is cool. Although it does suffer with some lazy beats and boring flow, but, if you like west coast gansta Mobstyle Muzik than this is it. Its got everyone from the bay who's tight. For ex. The Luniz, Bart From 3xKrazy, Cydal, Celly Cell, Mac Dre, 4Tay, & B-Legit just to name a few. The cd Starts off with the most bass heavy song from Daz I've Heard in a long time. Than you add Cydal,The Luniz, and Dru Down For the next track ""Money"" witch contains a sample of ""you are my everthing"" the next 3 or 4 songs kinda get a little weak .But after that it picks up right where it left off with a blazing track by Kamikizee ""Bart"" From 3xKrazy then it carries itself all the way to the end this is a keeper with just the 3 tracks imentioned plus the full size calander makes it worth the money West Side Ridaz 4 life."
3,NOT WEST COAST RAP,"I BOUGHT THIS CD LOOKING FOR SOME HARDCORE WEST COAST SOUNDZ BUT THIS CD SOUND LIKE SOME NO LIMIT S**T, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT U BUT I DETEST NO LIMIT, THERE IS ABOUT 4 GOOD SONGS BUT IT WASN'T WORTH MY $20, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME NO LIMIT SOUNDZ, THIS IS THE CD FOR YOU, TO ME, I EXPECTED SOME OLD DEATH ROW SOUND BUT I WAS WRONG, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, THE CALENDER THAT IT CAME WITH IS PRETTY COOL."
2,Fascinating Topic - Needed Better Editing,"This important and complex topic deserves ongoing analysis and research and this book is a good contribution with some well thought out hypotheses and ideas. However, the book needed better editing - sections appear repetitive and some arguments are not fully constructed and concluded. If you are an Alexander-phile, you may find this enjoyable, but not fully satisfying."
5,Easy to Read,A must read for anyone interested in learning about interior design without the vernacular of a formal education. Rybczynski does a wonderful job bringing the subject down to Earth.
3,interesting,"Fascinating history of the home from the Middle Ages to the 20th century, with a focus on how the built domestic environment influences us and vice versa. The cultural focus is western and European."
4,Spanish review,"Se trata de un libro entretenido e interesante,que se puede leer fácil y rápidamente una vez superado su primer capitulo, excesiva y superficialmente decorativo.El autor sigue a la vivienda a traves de los cambios que la transforman lo largo de la historia, cambios en la privacidad, en la comodidad, en la eficiencia...Para tratar estos y otros temas se analizan las transformaciones en las las diversas estancias de la casa así como en las relaciones entre ellas y se presta atención a las diversas escalas, desde las leves modificaciones en el mobiliario hasta la repercusión en la vivienda de los grandes avances tecnológicos como la electridad.Particularmente interesante: la introducción y evolución del concepto de ergonomía en la cocina -un invento norteamericano como reitera sin cansancio el autor canadiense."
5,Excellent results,"I bought one bottle in May of this year and I felt great during the time i was taking liver cleanse and about two months later..I was amazed at how energized i felt. I ordered the second bottle in August and still taking it. I love this product..I think it is best to keep using it..I will try it for a full year, and then stop to see if the benefits will be permanent. i realized that after couple months of finishing the first order I started to get fatigued easily, thus I ordered a second one. a must buy for those who have hard time in humid summer days. It will take about two weeks for the results to really show up. My suggestion buy it(at least two bottles)in May or early June so that the benefits to your liver fully materialize before hot days of July, August..."
4,still kickin',"As the latest installment from Chemlab, 'Oxidizer' doesn't disapoint. This album still has the very raw vocals that Jared has been known for...semi to super distorted and very aggressive, blunt and to the point. This album is more of a rock album, using less loops as there have been on other albums such as 'Burn out' or 'Exile', but there are still tracks that feature good industrial rock tunes, such as 'binary nation'. Industrial DJ's are best to stick to that tune, but standard radio DJ's are safe to play such kicking tracks as 'monkey God'.Overall, I say this is a good album, and worth going out and buying. After all, Chemlab is on one of the last true independant record labels. Support them!"
2,Chemlab should've stayed retired,"I came across this CD the other day and was really excited. I'm a big fan of their previous works including Burn Out At The Hydrogen Bar and East Side Militia. I'm really into most of the bands on Underground Inc. and last saw Jared performing with Pigface. It was awesome to hear him singing some Chemlab with them.After listening to this album, I was really disappointed. The sound and direction of the music was lacking their unique sound. Every time I thought the album would get better, I was let down. Only a few songs stood out to me, like Force Quit, Monkey God and Atomic Automatic. As I reflect now, I wish they hadn't made this album. I can only hope for better if they decide to make another."
5,Best use of the CD,"I recommend the very readable, do-able and motivating Laura Day book entitled ""The Circle"" for people who want to identify and move toward important life goals and then ""Welcome to your Crisis"" for those who want help with what seems to be an impossible situation.This CD product is meant to be used after taking the author's advanced class, or if you are an advanced student. Otherwise, much of the information will not have the right context.Laura Day speaks monthly at a group she leads at the NYC Barnes&Noble; in the village. www.practicalintution.com web site has current date."
1,Too bad I never received this order !!!!!!,I waited and waited and never recieved my product and then Amazon cancelled it on me.
3,Its ok.,Most of the songs you see listed are not the ones you get when you start the game. You have to play for hours non-end before you can start getting better songs.
3,if your a fan,"i guess if your a fan this is all good, but although i enjoy the game for a little indoor cardio and enjoy techno style music at times this grew old fast, the party mode only has two games and the workout mode does not impress at all, plus the repeated game over after 3 songs crap like i am playing in the arcade just makes me have to listen to the annoying announcer more often than is neccisary, but hey its ddr , its a bit of fun and good for a laugh at your friends if they will even jump up and try, all in all another ddr and not much else just wish it had something more evolved into it."
5,THIS GAME IS AWESOME,THIS GAME IS FLIPPING SWEET!!you can dance to some of your favorite song along with some pop stuff like brittany spears. in this game you can also do story mode wich allows you to do some cool little games and stuff.
1,"Game has potential, but one fatal bug","I am a longtime fan of the Dance Dance Revolution series and own virtually every game in the series, US or Japanese. And while I go back and play most of my older games regularly, I never play this one. Why? Because of one bug.Due to a programming glitch, the ""Dance Play Settings"" menu was omitted. As a result, it is impossible to disable the corner buttons on a dance mat without a gameshark or similar modification device. The corner buttons are enabled to allow play with a regular controller, but are not intended for use with a dancepad. Of course, since this game is designed for a dancepad, this is a problem. With the corner buttons on, this game constantly registers mis-hits on my steps and is basically unplayable.Konami should not have released this game with this bug, and they should have offered an update for free with a bugfix. As it, the game is unplayable."
5,Best.... Game.... EVER!!!!,"DDR extreme is honestly the best game that i have ever played. It seriously is. My favorite songs are 321STARS and kick the can.. just because they rock. Other songs i like are Maximiser, Drop out, and B4U. I rate this game 5 stars and i mean it. I also have DDRMAX which also rocks."
4,A Teen's Review,"Coming from DDR Extreme 2, I felt this version was a little less... advanced. Other than that, I like that this version has more ""real DDR"" songs and not ""American"" songs. I would recommend purchasing this."
2,"Interesting name, but musics are not that great.","I was expecting a lot more, but I am kind of frustrated with the set of musics this game has. There is only a handful of nice tracks, the others are bad! I will probably return it."
4,first-time player,"I have played DDR in arcades before, but this is the first time I owned the game for my new (I know, I am very behind) PS2. I like playing, and played without reading the manual. So I got to be pleasantly surprised by lots of things, like new songs appearing and getting an AA rating on beginner mode. I didn't like playing with the eye toy though, that was just weird.I don't know any of the game-playing nuances, or how it compares to other versions of DDR, or for that matter, what game play is like on the more advanced levels. But I have had fun. And there is a good mix of different songs with different tempos. And I like the workout mode. It empowers me to see the calories burned and how that compares to activities like jogging or swimming, even IF the numbers are not totally accurate. I have no idea if they take weight into consideration for their calculations, for example.I enjoy myself."
2,Not like the arcade game,"If you are looking for all your favorite songs that you find on the arcade version, you won't find it here. The idea of this game is still the same but you only have a limited amount of songs and most of the more popular songs are not on the consoule version."
4,A little disappointed with this one.,"DDR Max2 and Extreme2 are better (better songs and dances), but it is still a phun game."
3,c'mon ppl this game isnt all that,"first off i would like to say that this game is fun up to a certain point, and also the levels arent all that challenging which doesnt live up to the games name ""Extreme"" and for starters the only thing special about this game is they added a graph of how much calories you have burned ""wow"". i dont play this anymore because i brought ddr max2 which is off tha chain!! i play that all the time and this one is on the shelf collecting dust"
5,Great purchase!,"I researched the DDR titles for my daughter, age 8, as a birthday gift and decided on another after I could not get this one in time. Later, when she was frustrated that the one I purchased was not as much fun as those she played elsewhere, I came back and ordered this one for her. YOU SHOULD SEE HER NOW!She can really do these dances! And they are not easy kid stuff either! The songs are more curent and the moves are better than the original one I purchased. She has this constantly hooked up to the playstation, and uses it so often I had to get another gaming system just so my son could play some of his games. Finally, a video game that gets kids moving and increases skills and athleticism while they play! We love this game!"
3,"Try it, it won't hurt!","A previous review states this might be scary if you're too shallow to hack it. Well I love Fripp's work because it CAN be scary! This album draws you in through soothing soundscapes which Fripp builds up with truly disturbing effects. A listening experience which can leave you surprisingly emotionally drained, you might want to play something a little more conventional afterwards so you can relax! If you do have a ""fear of music"" you may not wish to tread down this path!"
5,Very Nice work from Maria!,"This CD is a must if you like Latin music with lots of tropical flavor. Maria's voice is, of course, powerful, clean and beautiful. The arrangements are excellent. Her versions of "" Mi mama no quiere"" and "" Cecilia"" are really good and I must recognize, it is hard to inprove a song that is already perfect. ""LatinoAmerica espera"" is very beautiful, definetly Maria at her best. If you don't have any of her other albums, this one is a great starting point. Definetly a good buy!"
4,A note from the band...,"Thanks for your support to those of you who have picked up and enjoyed our CD. We're currently in the writing and recording process for our follow-up disk. We're setting the bar pretty high, and hoping to make a record that will put us on the map once and for all. We've written a dozen new songs, and are aiming for a dozen more. We'll then put the best of these on a new disk sometime in Fall 2001. Hang on for a little longer, and we promise a kickin' next release. -Troutband"
5,"Very good source of information, every manager should have.",Excelent book for making your organization ISO 9000 compliant
2,Poor craftsmanship,"Very pretty but upon pulling of the back screw to wear for the first time, the opal popped off of the post. Looking for a good jewelry glue to fix it."
3,Up $2? Good at old price...,They work fine. Sometimes if you let them go too long they will break. People say they leak but these are biodegradable and you're filling them with rotten food. I would have bought more but with a $2 increase since I bought them a couple months ago? I'm all set and off to try another brand for $6 something. Someone is getting greedy.
5,A great way to help the Planet,"This trashcan liner is great.... I use it in my trash compactor..... so it gets used for a lot of conmpressions and STILL it holds up!!!I feel great about using a decomposable material instead of plastic, knowing I wont burden our planet in the same way as I would using plastic. Every bit helps!I use the smaller ones for our compost bucket.The big one holds up despite my concern at first of its durability. In fact it is better than the plastic ones I used!I highly recommend it!!!"
1,Not good,These bags are very flimsy and rip almost every time we use them. We have used other biodegradable bags that are much stronger.I will not buy them again.
3,Eh...,"I bought these to use in my kitchen compost bucket. They held up well while in the house...and held up, and held up, and held up in the outdoor compost tumbler too. I spread the compost anyway thinking that they'd eventually break down but even after the winter I was finding and picking up bags from my yard/garden. While they didn't do what I expected them to, I feel good about using bags that will (eventually?) break down someplace. I still use them in my kitchen bucket so I don't have to scrub it everytime. Good for lazy people like me to keep your bucket clean, not so good at breaking down quickly."
2,better to use nothing,"I bought these bags to line my compost pale. The bags ended up not helping with the mess and creating a new problem in the process to boot. First, the bag disintegrated and let leachate out into the pale that I still had to clean after I emptied the pale. No time or mess savings whatsoever. Second, when I went to my compost pit to empty the pale, everything came out in a big clump and it was very hard to break the bag apart to let the contents mix throughout the pale. The bag got syrupy and stuck to all the mushy food inside. I used this product for at least a month before I got sick of it and decided to revert to using no lining. I still have to clean the pale out each time I empty it, but its not too bad and no clumps in the compost."
4,"Compost BioBags, 3 gallon","These are nice bags. They do tend to leak, though. To solve that problem I just knot the bottom. When the bag is full, I toss the whole thing into the compost pile. They don't compost quickly; it takes about 6 months for them to start breaking down. Full breakdown seems to be about a year. But we don't turn our ""pile"" often, or wet it down as often as we should, so more turning and wetting will probably get the bag to compost faster."
1,Buy at Whole Foods,"I am new to composting and purchased this item on Amazon. My kids always tease me about buying everything on Amzaon - I am a fan because I like the convenience of receiving the products right at my door (instead of having to lug them from the shops), the prices are competitive and I often do not have to pay taxes. Unfortunately, that was not the case with this item. I found it at Whole Foods for a cheaper price. The vendor wrote asking about my experience but when I complained about the price, I never heard from them again. My son has used the product and said it does not hold up well to moisture. At the farmer's market, one of the fruit stalls provide a compostable bag from Ecopond - they work great and I'm going to look for this product on the Internet."
5,biodegradable--- great!,"I have set the pail on my kitchern counter, with a bag in it, and have almost filled the first bag. It has taken a lot of scraps and leftovers, because there is already some decomposition taking place, so the level in the bag keeps dropping. I am looking forward to being able to simply drop the entire bag into my composter... no more emptying a very messy plastic bag, and then having to get it in a trash can... Just drop this one in and let nature take its course!"
2,Better to use nothing,"These bags are in very good condition and packaging when they arrived, but not sure whether it has been in stock for too long or whether the corn material inside the bags were breaking down or something, I found these bags are not as strong as what I used to buy, the same thing. Hope this won't happen again, otherwise, I do not trust these biodegradable bags anymore. Thanks!"
4,Good Product . Fulfilled expectations,These biodegradable bags are worth the price that you pay for them.Size is perfect for a Kitchen trash bin. The bags are sturdy.It would be nice if I could get them locally or for free shipping.But that does not take away from the quality of the product.
4,They worked ok,I liked them at first but when my hubby didnt empty it fast enough the bag decomposed in the bucket (eewwww) Just remember to empty every week and they work great!
4,"They fit the ""Kitchen Collector"" compost container...","These fit well in our Norseman Environmental brand ""kitchen collector"" which is 12"" x 8.5"" x 8.5""...I only know this because, like many of you, I finally broke down and sought a bag/liner solution for composting - cleaning nasty bins gets old and I just don't have the time. This was my one concern, that the 1.9 gallon bin (which is oval shaped) wouldn't allow for these liners. But, they fit fine and can be held in place with a heavy duty rubber band. As for whether they hold up too much (don't compost)/or too little (fall apart), I truly don't care as much, as I am using these for municipal organic composting on a weekly basis - so far they hold up OK. And I suspect they'll break down just fine. Heck, we're told we can compost meat and bones....Anyway, I bought the single pack but will buy the 4-pack box when I need refills. Just didn't want them to go to waste."
3,Not Worth the Price,"These bags are serviceable but I have what may be a petty complaint (which I voiced to the company).The packaging is, quite honestly, pathetic. They used to be on a roll and the bags were fairly easy to dispense. Now they've just rolled up a clump of bags and jammed them in a box. Absolutely no way to pull them out one at a time. This is just a nuisance that makes these bags not worth the price (which is not cheap). After I told the company that even the cheap generic bags in the grocery store have some way of dispensing one at a time rather than pulling out the entire lump of bags and trying to extricate just one, they told me that everyone liked the new packaging except me, I decided to find another maker."
1,What price composting?,I live in Portland Oregon where we just went to curbside collection of compostable materials. I bought my first supply of these same exact bags (25 per box) at my local big grocery store - $4.99 with discounted from 5.99 with a coupon. going on line to find perhaps a cheaper source I was amazed that Amazon has the gall to charge $9.50 for the same 25. What?? Just a warning - caveat emptor!
2,Flimsy BioBags,"The BioBags I have should be able to get from the kitchen to the compost bucket without ripping, but for some reason these bags would rip even if I am only slightly pulling on them. One of the bags actually worked but when my daughter returned from taking the compost out she told me that the bag almost broke all over her!"
1,They leak immediately,"We've been using these for about 2 weeks.They leak immediately. It's not like we'refilling them with liquid. The ""they breathe,but don't leak"" is false advertising.I would thing that doubling up would defeatthe purpose. I'm going to look for anotherproduct."
5,Bio Bags,It is exactly what I had purchased before. I like that I may order on line and combine with other products.
3,Biobags defeats the purpose with their plastic packaging,"Yeah... duh! I bought compostable bags to avoid plastic consumption, but Biobags packages their product in - yep, you guessed it - a plastic bag! What's the point, just to have fewer plastic bags? Well, I guess that's an option. The bags themselves are fine, perhaps a little thin but not leaky if you use it and get it to the composter or disposal quickly.I prefer another brand that comes in a cardboard box. The ones I found work great. If you want to know what kind they are just ask since I'm not adding it to the product review."
2,Didn't do so well,"Bought these for our kitchen composter to make disposal a bit easier. Unfortunately, when it came time to turn the compost these bags were still not degraded!"
2,Not that great,"We stopped using them. They are pretty flimsy and tended to leak in the compost pail, and they are very slow to break down in the compost heap. We were pretty disappointed overall."
4,alternate use as cat waste disposal bag!,i purchased these to use in my bathroom trash and with cat waste disposal. i cannot flush it so i wanted a more earth friendly way to dispose with out filling up landfills with plastic bags. i use along with arm & hammers new biodegradable liter! love them. only drawback is that they occasionally tear when you pull them off the role to hard.
2,Why spend the money?,"When we bought the stainless steel counter-top compost bin shown in the picture, my wife and I also bought some of the BioBags. She liked them; I didn't. (I like the bin, though). The BioBags are oversized for the bin, so you have to tie them around the rim, overlapping the bin, which ruins the stainless steel look. THen, the bags leaked or split, so I 'd have to bring the whole bin and the bag to the compost pile anyway. When we ran out, I didn't buy more and it's been fine without them. I just run the bin through the dishwasher once in awhile. Regarding degradability, I noticed they didn't break down as quickly the vegetable matter, but they did break down eventually, so they weren't a problem (I just dug them into the soil). Long story short, if you are really into composting, they don't add a lot of value. And they're pricey, to boot. Why spend the money?"
3,Flimsy and leaky,"I was hoping to keep my countertop compost container clean with these so I wouldn't have to wash it every use, and carry just the bags rather than the whole container out to my compost pile, but the bags seem to leak at the bottom and weep around the sides. The bags are usually not in the container more than 2-3 days, and if I am doing large cooking projects, sometimes only a few hours. Since they are very oversized for my one gallon container, I tie a knot in the bottom to try and control bottom leakage, but even so, I still have to carry the whole container out to the compost pile or the bag drips on the way. At first I thought eggshells were causing the leaks, but I have filled the bags with lemon rinds and coffee grounds, and they still leak. It still being midwinter here with plenty of snow on the ground, I cannot yet report on how well the bags break down in the compost pile."
3,Garden Help,"I like using compostable bags for items to go in my compost pile in the garden, unfortunatley while the purchased bags are the right size, they quickly allow liquid items to seep in the container thus having to clean container every time I get rid of the compostable bag. I wish they were made of a stronger compostable material."
4,Compostable kitchen bags,"These bags solved a problem. Our new home garbage service gave us a collection container for compostable kitchen waste, which is unpleasant to clean out. When we line the container with Biobags, we can lift out the whole bagful at once. These bags leave our container moist but not soiled, so that a brief swipe cleans the container for the next bag and the next batch of scraps. They are surprisingly strong for something made out of potato!"
4,A fine passive diffuser,"This 1 1/2' stone is great for diffusing essential oils. I use it at the office more for air freshening than aromatherapy. It fills the room with the scent with a couple drops in a few minutes without a spray can or electrically heated, dispensable plugin unit. I really like it, and it is easily hidden or just sits indiscreetly on my desk."
3,Sky,"The book Sky is a true story of courage during World War II. Hanneke Ippisch is the person telling the story. She is fifteen years old girl who joins the Dutch resistance and gets taken to prison. Sh ehad to figure out her own way to survive. The story is set in Zeppelin, Holland in 1929. It leads you through Hanneke Ippisch's wholee life story during the war.I would reccomend this book to any middle school student who is interested in learning about World War II. I liked the book Sky because it is an action filled book of courage of Hanneke Ippisch who was in the Dutch resistance. I liked the book and I hope you will as well."
2,Napoleon Solo masquerades as the Executioner,"Dead Man's Tale is actually by Peter Leslie, as acknowledged inside. Partway through, it started feeling awfully familiar; it turns out to be a rewrite of his Man from UNCLE tie-in novel The Splintered Sunglasses Affair from the 1960s. Bad form! That said, Leslie's other Executioners such as Sunscream are originals, and pretty good."
2,Inaccurate description & misleading photo/image,"The Product Details on amazon's page for this item give the dimensions as 8 x 1.8 x 9.5"", but in actuality the diameter of the lid is 7.75"" -- none of it measures even 8"" much less 9.5"". The item's ""title"" is ""Ekco Everyday Radiance Universal Nonstick Sauce Lid"" and the Product Features on amazon's page state that it has ""High quality non stick, easy to clean interior,"" BUT only the upper/top surface of the lid has a non-stick coating; the interior/underneath surface of the lid, onto which food in a pan will splatter as it cooks, is bare stainless steel -- there's nothing non stick or easy to clean about that! Though the lid may function OK on a 7.5"" or smaller pan, if you want a lid for an 8"" or 9-9.5"" pan, forget about this item! What a disappointment."
5,excellent album from and excellent country band!,"I recently obtained this album and absolutely LOVE it! This is the last CD the Whites made before switching to bluegrass music. My favorite songs are ""I Changed The Locks On My Hearts Door"" and ""Steel Away and Pray"". If you want to hear country songs from a good music group, then I recommend this album 100%!"

4,Excellent,"With the upcoming election looming, this video helps illustrate the depth and concern that Senator Obama will bring to foreign policy, not only in Africa, but in a broader sense. It also adds to the evidence and intrigue of his personality as genuine and highlights the candor he brings to potentially difficult subjects. The imagery of Africa, the brief visit with his family in Kenya, and the glimpse of how Senator Obama is viewed abroad are added reasons to view this item."
2,Paid Political Ad,"Documentary? A polished producton ad for the the dupes who thought they were going to view a legitimite documentary. Like me.The director (of Propaganda) once upon a time made a 'Documentary' about Barack Obama mentor, the one and only, Saul Alinsky. Don't know Saul Alinsky? Put on your investigative hat and find out what you don't want to find out.If one must absolutely watch this brainwashing, go to your public library and check it out for free. Like me."
1,La-dee-da,"This is a most profound Spiritual Guide To Understanding The Universe With Capitalization Of Each Word That Makes Things More Spiritual, You Know? And the convoluted wording and bizarre titles lead to greater depth and knowledge. Personally, I think that Adi Da Samraj/Bubba Free John/Da Free John/Da Love-Ananda/Da Kalki/Da Avabhasa/Franklin Albert Jones was The Promised God Man even though the dude died and had all kinds of weird controversies swirling around him. The Truly Bright and Enlightened need not worry, though. He is Uniquely and Avatarically Born with the ability to hear through his knees. Truly remarkable. Who better to give the True World Religion, after all? I mean, LOOK at the dude. The Promised God Man. Classic times, craaaazy days."
5,Cuts Ceramic Tile Well,"This is a 10"" rod saw but a good hacksaw is adjustable for various lengths so even if you have a 12"" hack saw blade in the saw now, you can probably use this. Just take the current blade off and the adjustment will be obvious. It cuts through ceramic tile fairly quickly and with little effort. I cannot cut as straight a line with this as could be cut with a diamond wheel so you might want to have your big box store do free straight cuts for most pieces but for pieces that will be covered with a switch plate this works fine. This saw is made in Taiwan."
5,Simply Great,"Gods and Monsters (Special Edition)Frankenstein (75th Anniversary Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)Frankenstein - The Legacy Collection (Frankenstein / Bride of / Son of / Ghost of / House of)Gods and MonstersGreat score for a fantastic movie about the one and only James Whale.Director of Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, the Invisible Man, the Old Dark House, just to name a few. I very much like this score cause it catches perfectly the movie's mood. Just like a grey, rainy autumn day."
4,An important and timely work,"This book is extremely useful in that it is the only complete synthesis of the Irish Iron Age archaeology. It is also simple to read and illustrates to the layman the differences between Ireland and Europe during the time of the Celts. However, many people are misled by the mystical title - this is a purely archaeological book!"
5,incredibly awesome,"metal at its best. too bad these guys were only together for one album. (broke up and some formed skinlab.) if you can't find it, keep looking..."
4,"Nancy was a special person,their will never be another perso","I liked this book very much,because the simple fact is that the AIDS Virus is real,and even if you think you can't or won't get it,here comes a reality check,that us teenager's can get it,that were not invinstable,though many of us think we are.This precious little girl's life was cut short because of some pervert's little games he liked to play.So please think before you have sex,with sex come's alot of responsibilities."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK - IT WAS WONDERFUL,"I loved this book. It doesn't matter how old or young you are, you can read and enjoy it. It is the type of book you can curl up with. Nancy had healthy relationships with her parents and friends. She was a very positive person who loved life and fun. I felt I got to know her, and thought 'she's the type of person I'd like to hang out with'. It's sad that she is no longer with us. It's horrible that someone took advantage of her and raped her and gave her AIDS. Nancy lost a lot - she lost her LIFE. I feel bad for her. I hope she's in a better place now, happy and having a blast."
5,It could happen to you ....,"I thought that the book ""It happened to Nancy"" was a very intresting and sad story of a true life teenager explaining the pain and grief that came from her illness of HIV. Nancy seemed to be a very strong person for not letting others how they act all nice to her get to her. Nancy was only 15 when she found out that she had aids. While her having aids she also had another illness that made her aids virus even worst. I can't say I feel Nancy's families pain because my famliy nor I been thru somthing similar like that. But I would like to say one thing that Nancy was a nice,caring young lovible lady that wasn't afraid to be afraid of what she had . She was herself,like everyone else that has waht she had that you shouldn't let what other people think or say its whats inside that counts and that your closest friends and family are always going to be ther for you. Be thankful for what you have and what you are."
5,This is the best and most important book I have ever read,This book is very insightful in the life of a teenage girl. It shows many things that parents don't know or necessarily understand. I am a teenager and I believe every parent and child should read this book!
2,An ok book,"A young girl is raped by a college man and he ends up giving her hiv and she dies, this book annoyed me so much it was so typical, a young dumb girl gets a crush on a guy, invites him to her house and he forces himself on her,its bad she got hiv but how dumb can you be to invite a guy you barely know over to your house alone a very cliche book, sadly a true one."
5,Awsome! A book every teenager should read especially girls.,It happened to Nancy is a great book. It is very emotional and I know i cried my eyes out. every teenage girl should read this book. It is great and I can't say enough about it. JUST READ IT!!!!! Please if you have or are going to read this book e-mail me.
5,It was great!,This is my favorite book in the world. It keeps you going from beginning to end! You will love it!
5,Great sad heart wrenching,"Its one of those stories where you stop while your reading it and realize it could happen to me. I'm almost 14 myself, what if this happened to me, I could feel the same pain as she did and so could you. I feel this story is right for anyone, and will make anyone realize the truth in this world. That its not such a safe place and even though you wish you could you can't trust everyone. If you haven't read it please do. We need to know the truth"
5,a true story that captures the reader's mind,I think this book was educational to people that think they will never get aids. It happened to nancy is a book that captures the reader's mind with a true story of this girl's life and her struggle with rape and aids.
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!,I read this book at a time where I was just introduced to High School and it's many temptations. It taught me many things. I was interested in this book so much that I couldn't put it down! Read it!
2,Love the book but is it real?,"I got this book as a gift when I was 15 from my older sister. She wanted me to read it and understand the dangers of being a young teen. The point of me reading this book was because it was ""real"". I cried the first time I read it. The book is extremely sad but after doing some research online there is a big debate if this book is real. Her other stories like ""Go Ask Alice"" have been said to be fake. Nobody has came forward saying they know ""Nancy"" or ""Alice"". After looking more into the author and her history with not being truthful..Iam unsure if this book is true but one thing I do know is that this book was a great read."
4,Good read,"I liked this story because it comes from a very real place. I like the author's retelling of the story using the teen's diary and coming down to the level a teenage reader could understand. I read this book wanting to understand more about what a a teen going through this ordeal was thinking, I got my answer. It's a very good book."
4,It could happend to anyone! My book review,"It happened to NancyMy book, ""It happened to Nancy"" was a very touching story. It is a true tale from an anonymous teenager's diary. She was an innocent fourteen years old when she fell in love for the first time. Collin was a college student; he date-raped her and left her infected with the HIV virus. When I was reading this book, I could feel Nancy's pain and struggles she faced dealing with Aids. I am so proud of her and how she dealt with her situation. This book really moved me. I learned a lot from her experience. I've enjoyed reading this book. It was easy to understand. I was absorbed throughout out the book. I definitely recommend this book to all teenagers. It is truly amazing how much you will learn from someone's experience. At the same time this book is educational. It contains all kinds of questions and answers about rape, this may help people understand better in dealing with situations like Nancy's.It happened to Nancy"
5,"AMAZING, WELL WRITTEN, IT MADE ME CRY!!!!!",THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING BOOKS THAT I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE. IT WAS DESCRIBED SO WELL THAT I FELT THAT I WAS NANCY. I CRIED FROM THE MOMENT I READ HER FIRST ENTRY TO HER LAST ONE.
1,Definitly not a good book,"It seemed interesting, but its actually pretty boring. Its not well written, I definitly dont reccomend it. Go ask alice was a bit better..but didnt like that one much either. Plus i doubt anyone really writes like that in a diary. there must have been many touch ups from the author.."
1,It DIDN'T happen to Nancy ...,"I believe this book isn't true. Why? Because although AIDS effects each persons' body differently, she would not known that fast that she had it. (In the book she gets sick about a week after being infected) Plus the doctor couldn't just give her an HIV test like that. He'd have to ask for her permission first. And she wouldn't get the results that soon.There's more & if you read this book carefully you realize all the holes in this un-true story."
4,It happened to Nancy,"The book ""It happened to Nancy"" explains the life of a girl who has AIDS. This book is her diary, and it explains what has happened to her all the way through her battle with AIDS and how she copes with it. This is an excellent book to read . I would recommened it to anyone of all ages because AIDS is a big problem in the world today. Also if you think that you have is bad, this is an excellent book to read to tell you that you have it a lot easier than some people. Also at the end of the book, there is some back round information on her and some things that she didn't write in the book. Also there are some little thing that her parents said about her and her life. Lastly the book has 5 question and answer pages. On the pages are any questions that you may possibly have about HIV, AIDS orany other AIDS related questions."
3,"Sad, but true?","I have read this book so many times and I cry each time I do. Normally, I do not cry while reading books yet this one got to me. There were some unrealistic aspects of the book (i.e. Only days after the rape, she tried to lead a ""normal"" life and forget about the event). I know that I would get my father or some family member to kill the rapist. Overall, the book is heart-wrenching and sad. I advise any teen girl to read this."
4,Very haunting...,"This is very haunting and chilling. Especially because it is someone's real diary. This book made me cry when I found out she had the HIV virus, I felt as if I knew her and she was like my best friend. So much emotion came over me, it was amazing..haunting. I loved this book, and think it is very amazing how Dr. Sparks could bring these diaries to us!"
2,Interesting story,"So I had to read this in catholic school when I was 13. Scarred the hell out of me, tought some good lessions. Good for putting fear in children. Its a sad story but interesting. Looking back its pretty stupid.Errors1. Book is 100% fiction, not a true story2. Seroconversion in HiV takes longer then 2 weeks3. Not everyone gets flu like symptoms4. No consent for HIV test, No reason to test her, doesent make sense, psychic MD?5. Hiv progress's to AIDS and patient dies in 2 years while colin who obviously has the same strain of the virus is still living?6. No Antivirals?? Azt clinical trials took place in early 1990'sWorth a read for someone older then 14. Scared straight"
3,Tragic,"What an awful thing to happen to such a young girl, well to anyone for that matter.14 year old Nancy meets Collin and instantly forms a close bond with him. She is completely head over heels for him. Until one night when they're alone in her mom's house. Collin rapes Nancy and she never hears from him again. She slowly beings so feel ill and is told by her doctor that she has HIV. The book journals her ups and downs and how she struggles with life. Although this book is meant for young adults, I think this is a great book for everyone."
3,"Decent quality, odd measurements.","One would imaging the specs given should be the opening width, but are not, they are the length of each arm, and are short in their measurements.Otherwise its a fairly decent coated hook for the price."
2,Thier brand is not my cup of tea...,"I give this two stars for the effort. Although I enjoy occasionally listeing to thier other cd, whcih sounds more liek rockabilly. This cd is NOT rockabilly at all! This sounds liek Rev. Horton Heat. This is just plain punk music, with a cool name... Too bad because this band seemed to be going in the right direction, I guess they took a wrong turn, and got sidetracked to plain old boring punk. Hope they will make thier next cd a rockabilly one for all their fans."
3,"OK, BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED",I think this booklet is good for a quick read to prepare for a open house. I've been to a lot of open houses and lots of owners don't know jack on prepping their house to show. So this booklet serves its purpose in getting the basics down.
5,This rocks the world baby,All right this is ausome and those goofs who wrote it stinks are a bunch of roody pooh candy a** and should get with it and admit they like country music because there just not with it and thats the bottom line. This CD is ausome and everyone should have it.
3,This cd is ok,"Even though this has old wwf themes, it brings back good memories. If you own both other wwf themes, u gotta get this one to complete the collection. It's better than vol 2 but not 3."
5,A must for the KLIQ fans,"Hall's old music, Nash's old music, Waltman's old music, and of course Michael's classic ""Sexy Boy"" make this a must for any Kliq fan out there. If only Triple H were a bigger star back then, but 4 out of the 5 ain't bad. If you are a fan of the WWF of 95-96 when the Kliq ruled, this is the CD for you."
2,Go With Volumes 2 and 3,"Full Metal starts off great with both themes from Monday Night Raw, but goes downhill from there. Other than that the only good ones are Goldust, Hitman, and HBK's theme. Only pick this up if you are a big fan of the older WWF wrestlers, or want to complete your WWF: The Music collection (like I did)"
2,OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLD,C'mon you guys can do better buy #2 and/or#3 this one is not worth it :
5,WWF Full Metal,Great service!!The CD came in record time and it was in great shape just as promised!I would definatly buy from this seller again!Thanks for the great buy!
3,Keep your hands off the merchandise!,"This was the first album to feature WWF Superstars arena entrance themes. Before the entrance music, it starts off with two hard rock songs by members of various hard rock bands. They are pretty decent. Wrestling fans will recognize ""Thorn in Your Eye"" as the theme from Monday Night Raw. Then, you get 12 entrance themes from around 1995. The only ones that will be familiar to today's wrestling fan are The Undertaker's theme ""Graveyard Symphony"", Shawn Michaels' theme ""Sexy Boy"" and Goldust's theme... ""Goldust"". For the most part, the themes feature one riff looped over and over for three minutes. Kind of repetitive, but fans of wrestling from the mid-'90s may enjoy it."
5,"Brillant, Masterful","Protégés of Robert Fripp, CGT expands out of their comfort zone on this one to push their technical expertise to the limit. Any group that can successful put Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in C# Minor"" onto 3 acoustic guitars has got to be special - but then they move to a western style on ""Train"" and an incredibly rocking ""Good, Bad, and Ugly"". But the true gem is ""Up in the Clouds"" - A cross between Pink Floyd and Vangelis, or King Crimson and Enya? No comparison does it justice, but it is moving. A masterful disc."
4,"Still Fun, Less Honest...","What I loved about Yamanashi Blues was the elegant simplicity of the thing. Three guys, three guitars...simple, direct, and really good.This album adds a bit of production to the mix, some strings here, a little background stuff there...it's all still very good, but I liked stuff the old way. I guess I really am a ludite.Some gold here though. This is one of the best versions of ""Apache"" I have ever heard, and remarkably, these guys managed to turn the goofy theme from ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,"" into high art.Lotsa fun."
4,Guitar music,"I enjoyed it very much-great ""different"" use of guitares-Robert Fripp put then togeter & trained- definitlt different!It's a great ""listen"" in addition!"
5,Proper Skinhead Music,"First off, this is the true music of Skinhead. Don't let some prat tell you it's Oi!, Punk, or even Hardcore. That said, the music on this CD is full of tunes that would have been played during Skinhead's heyday of 1968-1970. The music makes you wanna dance and have fun, not beat people or things up. Most tunes on this compilation are hard to come by in their original vinyl formats unscathed, which is all the more reason to pick this gem up!!!"
4,Love hate,"I purchased this because I often work away from home and thought it may alleviate some of the separation anxiety my dog surfers. The toy itself is well constructed and quite robust. Treats fit easily inside although hard ones work better, and I had no problem recording a message. However, my dog did not like it at all. Eventually, I give it to a friend and his dog loves it.Therefore good toy for the right dog."
5,Song by Song Review,"1. Goodbye- This song is really really well done. It isn't a dance-pop tune (like 'Wannabe'), it's a meaningful song written for Geri and for ends of relationships in general. It's a beautiful ballad and should be a hit! 2. Christmas Wrapping- Complete opposite of 'Goodbye'. This is a very cool song, and is more of a 'Wannabe' type song. This is a cover of the old Waitresses hit, which I've heard, and let's just be glad that the Spice Girls are singing it instead of them... The beat is cool and so are the lyrics (they revised them) 3. Goodbye (Orchestral Version)- Now this song is even better than the original pop version. It has much more feeling and when the percussion comes in at the end- it's really up-lifting. The best song of the single. THIS SINGLE IS FOR ANYONE THAT LIKES GOOD MUSIC- SPICE GIRLS FAN OR NOT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GREAT SONGS, BUY THIS RECORD."
3,Amazing,I think it's one of their best songs! It's sad due to the fact that this song was released just after Ginger spice had left the group. And this song made them keep going as four piece group!
4,"I NEED THE WORDS, NOW!!!!!!!!","Hey, what's up?! Well, I've I'm not really a big fan of the Spice Girls but I like some of their songs, like ""Wannabe"", ""Viva Forever"", and ""Goodbye"". I really like the song ""Goodbye"" but I need the words !!! I can't find them anywhere! I'm like desparate! Does anyone know where I could find the words of the song? It would be even better if someone knows them, and if you do, you can E-mail me and send me the words of the song. I would be SOOOOOOOO grateful to you!!! THANX!PEACE!"
4,Excellent,"Ten Seconds is Robert Fripp from King Crimson working with Jeff Fayman of Ministry.A lot of moves on this album come as no suprise, and the pairing of these artists is natural. You could argue these abrasive textures were partly invented by King Crimson in 1969 on ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" fromIn the Court of the Crimson King. Fripp has also been playing on soundscapes made by others for decades: listen toNo Pussyfootingwith Eno, 1973.Ten Seconds is from the 1990s, and as such has 90s digital compression. The writing here is fine, but compared to King Crimson and other Fripp projects, the audio seems a little flatStill, both Fripp's leads and his trademark Frippatronics are excellent here.This team up is definately worth buying."
4,Excellent Reference,"I have an earlier edition of this book and I've used it so much that the cover is bent and the pages yellowed. I find this a very good reference work when I need to know what an idiom means. One of the best features of the book is that after each definition of an idiom, the idiom is used in a sentence. This really helps one understand the meaning of the phrase. While I like this book, I don't feel it's as good as the idiom dictionary published by Houghton: that one lists a date of origin for each idiom."
2,A Dictionary of American Idioms,"I bought the dictionary for my son who's a 4th grader and been in the process of learning and using idioms. While the book covers a wide range of idioms, it does seem to have some gaping holes in terms of the completeness of its listings. We oftentimes have to use the Internet to complement the search. This is a disappointment, seems we could simply just use the Internet instead."
5,Has everything,This book is funny and a lot of help!It is very helpful in understanding ASL as a communication tool.
3,What a voice!,"I saw Celinda live and was blown away by her voice. I bought this album and at first was a little disappointed. It didn't seem to have the fire I had witnessed. Then came her rendition of ""Me and Bobby McGee"" and there it was. If you want the chance to hear one of the greatest voices in the world then buy this album for Kris Kristofferson's classic. The rest of the album is okay. Powerful, expressive, gritty and moving."
5,Wonderful Musician!!,"Jenny Labow is a very dear friend of mine! She has amazing music, this is the 4th CD I've bought. Not many of these floating around anymore and I was hoping I could find another copy since mine are all scrached!!"
4,Suns of Scorpio,"This is the second book in the Dray Prescot adventure series on the planet Kregen under the suns of Antares. In this the Star Lords project Dray onto the coast of Turismond at the entrance to the Eye of the World, where the Zairians and the ziggurat building Grodnims battle over the dominance of the Red and Green suns. He rescues a couple and then becomes involved in the eternal conflict of this inner sea. In adventure on adventure Ken Bulmer writing as Alan Burt Akers reveals this world of monsters, heroic deeds, and Alien races. This book is also available with the other first five novels of the series in the newly reprintedThe Saga of Dray Prescot: The Delian Cycle (The Saga of Dray Prescot), The dangers are intense, the rewards immense and suspense unending. Hi Jikai!"
4,Bogie Collection 2,All in all the films are all some of my favorite Bogart films and look forward to the 3rd volume.
4,Thats a Man!,"The signature collection Volumne 2 was a trip. The only issues I have are1. Why is ""Satan met a lady"" included. I see a lot of parallels in this film with other Bogart movies.2. The original Maltese Falcon was included for what reason? Those who want to see Bogart, want to see Bogart.I think most customers would prefer if two other Bogart films were substituted for the above. Just my opinion.Across the Pcific, Action in the North Atlantic, Passage to Marselle and All through the night, are priceless."
4,War Films,"With the exception of The Maltese Falcon, this set is a bunch of war films. The War films are not of the same quality. However to appreciate the War Films, you need to watch them knowing they are a piece of Propaganda. By doing looking at them in this light, you realize the purpose they had.If you are just getting into classic films, do not get this. Rather getHumphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 1 (Casablanca Two-Disc Special Edition / The Treasure of the Sierra Madre Two-Disc Special Edition / They Drive by Night / High Sierra)orBogie and Bacall - The Signature Collection (The Big Sleep / Dark Passage / Key Largo / To Have and Have Not). These two collections are by far the best. Get these two first, then if you really like Bogart get this collection."
5,god set at good price but lacks in special treatment,"this set i bought at discounted price and is wonderful.though it leaves you wanting.its a signature collection and their are no special stuff.compare this with mickey rooney judy garland 4 dvd set it stands no where.their is no trivia booklet,postcards ,old poster book nothing.only the dvd's in thin plastic cases."
5,Excellent collection,"I am a big Bogart fan, and this is a great collection. I had only seen two of the films (Maltese and All Through the Night), so I knew it would be worth it for those alone. I have now watched the other three, and it's icing on the cake. They are all fine films and well worth seeing. I think I like Across the Pacific best. It's amazingly mysterious. I haven't watched the bonus material, but the films are all top notch. One of he best of the Signature series!"
3,SLOW TO FOCUS,"This is a good lens, not a great one. The problem is that it is very slow to focus. I almost always go back to my Canon 70-300 lens because it's extremely fast and really great!"
1,Doesn't Frickin' Work,"Don't waste your money on this, the thing is intermittent at best. How well do you think you can play a game when your keyboard stops registering a button after about 2 seconds. Fine for just tapping them, but if you want to continue moving forward...it leaves much to be desired. Sent the first one back for this problem; ok, not too bad, had to pay for the return myself, but did get a new one back in a fairly short time. Guess what...same problem. Adjusted it according to the instruction manual, and even bought a new keyboard to see if that was the problem. Still doesn't work. Should have just rolled that 30 bucks up and smoked it. Just buy a 360, they're gonna put out a licensed keyboard for that one."
3,Was hoping for better,"I guess I had higher expectations, some songs just didn't seem to be very well written"
5,Quintessential Praise & Worship Album,"This album is a quiet yet potent example of masterful lyrics that flow from song to song held together by non-intrusive and well arranged music. Aaron's love of Christ comes through loud and clear in a artful and beautiful way. It's as if he invites the listener into an attitude of praise and worship without force or theatrics. Track 10, My Saviour My God, is arguabley one of the most incredible recordings of all time, but the awesome thing is that the rest of the album holds its own quite nicely as well. My sense is that this album will be around for years to come and pack the same punch as it did on release day."
5,Wish we had more like this one!,I have to say that I really like every song on this CD. Excellent! 5 stars.
3,Not What I expected,"After hearing the awesome songs Matchless and My Savior My God on the radio I was in great anticipation to receive this CD but when it actually arrived I was a little disappointed. It's not a bad collection but it is also not spectacular. Two of the ""songs"" are not even complete and last for less than 40 seconds (Give Me Words: 17 sec. and In Your Name: 35 sec). It's not bad, but this collection was just not what I had expected. Some of the songs are really great but others are a little disappointing. These are the ones where I kept waiting for something to happen, the melody to take off like in My Savior My God but nothing ever happened. Besides the two I already mentioned the only other song that really impressed me was the last one: One Day which has more variation in the music and the singer's voice. I have to give this CD a three."
2,SHHSh,I was wanting such a wonderful album when I got this one. I had heard his song on the radio and thought it was going to be great. It was to me a little weak. I am a little hard on music so other people might enjoy this album. But I did not. I was ok lyrically but weak musically.
4,Albemarle: A Story of Landscape and American Identity,"This book was purchased for personal research about Albermarle County and the spread of the ladscape in that part of the country. This is a wonderful coffee table book and includes beautiful, almost ethereal images of a variety of environmental scapes. I expected the text to be much more about the modern day terrain and was a little dissappointed to find that a lot of it is very very historical. I don't believe it to be the best resource for my purposes but I was enthralled with it nonetheless."
2,Book Production Flawed,"Nothing wrong with the content of the book but for a coffee table book, this one from Amazon had several flaws. Yes the cost was less than buying at the bookstore but the bookstore copy probably wouldn't have wrinkled pages and pages still stuck together with the edges uncut. Really shoddy quality."
2,Great-for about 3 weeks...,"I bought a pair of these after ripping out my old ones-I train pretty heavy, but nothing excessive compared to powerlifters. These straps were reccommended to me by the company rep as being the strongest and most durable-they lasted 3 weeks before ripping. I currently use straps made from seat belt material-rough it up with some sandpaper and use chalk-they're indestructable."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this disc based on my love of Wunderlich's Dichterliebe, which is one of my favorite CDs of all time. Well, I could hardly have been more disappointed. This is a collection of sappy old tunes, sung in a very sentimental and overdramatic way. If you're a fan of Bocelli and his ilk, go for it. Otherwise, stay clear!"
3,Cute Shoes but consider sizing,"These shoes are very cute, but the sizing was too small. My suggestion would be to order a half or even whole size larger. I'm very disappointed as I was really looking forward to having these as staples of fun in my shoe wardrobe!And, the only fun I get is that I get to pay the postage because the sizing error is considered my mistake. Oh, well!"
5,Simple idea well executed,"Hanging leg raises are a great way to work your abs - expecially if you've already been doing crunches and you're looking for a way to up the intensity of your workout. You can do leg raises just by holding on to a chin-up bar - but your ab workout will be limited by your grip stength and endurance, and it can also put a lot of strain on the shoulders. Using these straps allows you to support your weight on your upper arms, allowing for a longer, more intense workout. The straps are sturdy and made to last a long time, and they have just enough padding to prevent digging into your arm. A gym I used to workout at had a pair and they held up for years with a lot of use. My new gym doesn't have them, so I bought my own, because I like them that much."
5,Sanctuary,"I'm not really great about writing book reviews but Amazon.com asked for my thoughts.""Shelter for the Spirit"" is one of the most beautiful, meaningful books I've ever read. I was so impressed that I purchased another copy for my aunt who has recently lost her husband and moved to a smaller home. It was my intention to share the beauty of this book with my Aunt so that she can create the next phase of her life and home.Many of Victoria's idea are simple, common sense and yet they are written so beautifully that you find yourself sheltered within the book. Ms. Moran is one of my favorite authors. All of her creations are lovely little treats and are reserved in a special part of my bookcase for when I want to visit ""an old friend."" Don't hesitate to read her books or to give them all as gifts. They are simply beautiful and beautifully simple.Enjoy!Mother Crone"
5,this book is amazing....,"i bought this book thinking this was, yet another, organization book that would turn me from disorganized to organized. .....but it wasn't....it was truly inspiring! no it did not tell me how to organize specific things...like other books. it told me how to make a ""home"". it told me how to separate the necessary from the unessary belongings in my life. there were spiritual messages but not from one dogma. the author uses suggstions from many cultures for u to choose what works for you. its a truly beautiful book with many beautiful ideas. just reading it made me feel good."
5,A Gem -- Wisdom and Insight for the Frazzled Masses,"I stumbled onto this book during a search for, of all things, some decorating tips! What a fantastic and fortunate accident. The author delivers warm and wonderful suggestions for simplifying your life, finding joy in your surroundings and remaking your home into a spiritual and supportive environment. Check this out--and share it with others!"
3,A good introduction,"I enjoyed this book a great deal but read it after I had tackled some other books dealing with homemaking and simplifying your life. The author gives a great overview of how crazy our lives have become and some good general ideas for setting a more sane pace in our homes. I think I was looking for more specific ideas, like those in Home Comforts, by Cheryl Mendelsohn, but this book reinforced the ideas that started me on this path a few months ago. I very much want to pass it on to some friends who have lost sight of the importance of home. I think a great follow-up, for anyone interested, would be Simple Abundance by Sara Ban Breathnach (spelling?). She provides specific actions and steps you can take over the course of a year to achieve the goals Victoria Moran outlines in Shelter."
4,Wonderful Music - But the price?,This is some wonderful music. The two players work in tandem to create purposeful improvisations full of beautiful melodies and strikingly vivid textures. They have an uncanny knack for building to effective climaxes. Great listening. But $35.99? In the era of music pirating and iTunes? I got this one from my local library for free.
5,"Flawlessly Presented, Highly Recommend!!!!!","Damn Dutch, is not only highly readble and flawlessly presented, it is extremely thought provoking. If you want to immerse yourself in an excellent history that reads like a novel, pick up Damn Dutch. Co-author Keller shines and adds significantly to the power of this story that has long been overshadowed by the Civil War's more ""popular"" vingettes."
1,Technician,I had these bulbs in both of my cars and three of the bulbs burned out in 4 months time. I have replaced many headlight bulbs and I know not to touch the glass. I emailed Piaa and got no response. These things are junk do some research.
3,Def Bright but not as white/blue as advertised,"These bulbs are def bright and I bought them to match the HIDs on my G37. The stock HIDs are rated at 4000k and these certainly are much more yellow than advertised. If you're looking for bright fogs these are for you, but not as white/blue as advertised, in fact, id be shocked to call these any less than 5000k."
3,Decent...,"They are nice, good color and bright, however they only lasted about 7 months with moderate night driving, no day-time running lamps either. Vehicle is a 2004 Elantra. They did however survive a 4500 mile road trip from Colorado to Florida and back, with approx. 24-30 hours of night driving."
5,As Advertised...,"I'm happy with my purchase. I wanted whiter (not bluer), brighter light, than what came on my '07 Rabbit, and the Xtreame Whites delivered.The only question is, how long will they last. With the Rabbit's Daytime Running Lights, the low beams are on all the time. After checking the PIAA website, I didn't feel too confident that they'll last too long.But so far so good...!"
3,Ok I guess,"I am not an expert on headlamps, but to me there does not appear a lot of difference between these and the stock standard lamps. Maybe a little whiter and brighter but not dramatic. Not convinced it was worth the extra dollars."
3,Bright but short life,I've gone thru 4 pairs of these bulbs on my 2001 BMW 3 series. I typically would average 3 to 4 months of life per a bulb. Just glad the store I purchased them has a 1 year warranty. These bulbs have a bluish hue to them and do not match most HID/Xenon factory bulbs.
2,Math Text for Trade Schools,"This book came up during a search for Sheet Metal techniques and practice. However, the contents are really basic level high school math with sheet metal based examples wherever that is appropriate. The figure on the cover has almost nothing to do with the book. The math is OK as far as it goes -- High school algebra 1 plus a small smattering of geometry and trig. The sort of math that is needed by those working on the shop floor with sheet metal. So if you dropped out of high school to go to work in construction and sheet metal is your trade, this is the book for you. If you are looking for sheet metal design, layout or fabrication, look elsewhere."
2,Brief,"It was a very short book, and very brief. It didn't really go into detail about what life was like living with Kristen. It was more of an overview."
2,"Good Effort, Pathetic Product","It was a truly good effort in talking about children with special needs, but this book is not well written. The grammar and spelling are not great, and the sentence structure is very childish. In addition, there is not much psychological information in this book. As a counselor, I was hoping that this would be a good memoir, but also that people could learn from this family's experience. Instead, there are glossed over life stories and ""self defined"" ideas of psychiatric disorders. While I'm sure it was written with good intentions, this book was severely disappointing."
3,Redundant single,"This is a single of Robert Fripp's Soundscapes. Tracks 1, 3 and 4 are from his album _The Gates of Paradise_, while track 2 is from _A Blessing of Tears_.If you already have both those albums, this item is redundant and you don't need it. If you don't... sadly, this isn't a great overview of Fripp's soundscape work, so you won't get a good image of what that is - it's better to buy a full album (_That Which Passes_, IMHO, is the best of the bunch)."
3,Space sampler,"3 1/2Though it sides on the indulgently underwhelming in its brevity, PJ's title track alone deserves storage as some of electric guitar-distilled ambiance's finest tonal articulations."
4,My review to an ACE game,"Hi! This is a stratagy game (like Comand & Conquer) where you control the Comando's, or the Gorgonite's. Each character has their own unique weapon, and the ability to pick up items, such as keys, weights, TNT, cherry bombs, plus more. As you progress, you get the oppertunaty to rescue squad members, and do missions. I like this game a lot. GO BUY IT!"
2,Grill Cover,Grill cover already tearing and ripping in just a month. Shipping also took about a week more than estimated ship date. WOuldnt recommend this product or company to anyone
4,"Great dancer, great guitarist, fine singer","Although Carmen (1913-1963) was of course primarily a dancer — THE female dancer of the century — she was also an excellent singer with a marvellous Gypsy voice. The material here contains the best tracks from her two definitive albums (""Queen of the Gypsies"" andFlamenco) with the amazing Sabicas on guitar, showing what he was capable of as an accompanist. The rhythm the two of them generate (e.g. on the Bulerías or the Jaleo Canastero) is nothing short of phenomenal. The recording quality is also considerably superior to that of the other tracks (from around 1950) with José and/or Paco Amaya on guitar, for which I deduct a star.The total time is 55'12"".P.S. For a list of (and links to) all 20 albums in this series, see my So You'd Like To... Listen to Great Masters of Flamenco Guide."
5,Dexter Romweber: Folk Songs. A Review,"Just when I though I couldn't be more inundated with both the former Flat Dou Jets and the current Dex Romweber Duo, I am once again taken aback and astounded.Dexter Romweber's ""Folk Songs"" collection is a little known treasure of eclectic solo works that in my opinion reveal the flexibility and multitalents of Dex that are not completely apparent in any of his other works, in the sense that the songs are diverse and experimental, yet filled with as much raw emotion and mood that true fans have come to know and recognize. This has become a favorite in the form of a rare treat. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone with an appreciation of true and original rock and the roots from which it came from!80sskatebettySacramento, CA"
1,not good,this is supposed to smell lake apples but it smells nasty i dont want to over exaggerate and say it smells like vomit but it does. i thought it might be because it is concentrated so i mixed it with my fog juice like the directions said and it is still nasty. i have the strawberry and rum scent and they are both great. i'd like to try the tropical scent but after this apple experience i dont know if i want to risk it. I defiantly do NOT recommend this product.
1,In the Dark Again,"I installed a lamp and a fresh battery in my flashlight and it worked great. I used the flashlight the next day for about 20 minutes or so. So far so good. However, a couple days later the lamp failed.I tried the second lamp from the 2-pack but it didn't work at all. So I didn't have very good luck with this product since I'm back where I started; in the dark. This may be a great product and maybe I just happened to receive the one in a million that was bad. The Solitaire flashlight is inexpensive and it would have been better if I had purchased a new one instead of the replacement lamps."
4,Very bright,"The parts were received in a very good condition, and fast delivery. Work very well on my flashlight."
5,A classic!,This book will help anybody interested in emergency diagnosis of stroke to be able to interpret to unenhanced head CTs. This excellent monograph summarizes the experience of the group of people who performed the CT evaluation of the ECASS study. It shows multiple cases of early stroke that the reader can try and study in order to establish an early tissular prognosis.This book is simply indispensable
1,Wagner bulbs inside of Hella boxes,"I've learned that Hella boxes come from Korea and India, packing two different versions of Wagner labeled 9004LL bulbs. Do not buy Hella bulbs and expect Hella bulbs, make sure."
2,"Great for recent grads, not seasoned pros","Okay, I'm not a seasoned professional, but I can write a resume, and pretty darn good one at that. However, I was looking for ways to give mine a new touch. I bought this book used, and it was worth the $7 I paid for it. I got a couple of new ideas, but it was more of the same old information."
3,Disappointing ending. Bah Humbug!,"Everything about the book is delightful. The characters are just right; you love Darci, you hate Adam, until he mellows out. You understand the storyline as the story happens, it all fits together well with the evil truly being evil, and then it's like the editor said, ""this is enough pages, we don't want you to describe the ending, just do a synopsis in the epilogue."" I was horrified that there was no description of the conflict, no passionate reunion with the hero and heroine, and no the true vanquishing of all foes, etc. It was like the editor and publisher decided the book was too long and cut it off at the knees. This book MUST have a detailed ending for it to work. It's very very disappointing to come to a denouemant and not have one. AND NO SEX?!? What gives? If you need help writing a good ending, let the fans do it. Trust me, we are not shy about what is good to experience through reading."
1,Very disapointing,"I've read everything Jude Deverax has put out (Sweet Liar is my #1 all time fav and her Velvet series is in the top 5) but she has really slid downhill in the last few books.I cared nothing about Darci. In fact, I was really annoyed by her.Adam is a MONTGOMERY but I didn't like him. I don't want him tied up with a bow and delived to my front door like previous Montgomery/Taggert men. (still waiting on my Kane Taggert BTW)There is a saying about a thousand monkeys typing on a thousand type writers for a thousand years comming up with something well, towards the end I think Ms Deveraux went out and found those monkeys.Very disapointing."
2,Disappointing,"After years of enjoying this author's works, I purchased this book eagerly - only to be very disappointed. While I understand that this is a fantasy, the major characters are so unbelievable as to leave me cold. It was difficult to finish it - I was ready to toss it less than half way through."
3,problematic,Decent begining and a fairly good middle bit.. I actually enjoyed read this book right up until the ending which was so thrown together and left so many things unanswered that I would hesitate to recommend the book.
2,Total waste of money,"I think this book was done because she had a contract to satisfy. It was a total waste of my time and money. I was disappointed because I really love her writing. One of my favorites is ""A Knight in Shining Armor"" by Ms. Deveraux. This one makes me think maybe I should wait until the books are in the library. I know I will not purchase one of her books in hardback. I can wait for the paperback issue.This book, in my world, is equivalent to a Harlequin romance novel written in the 70's. It is pure fluff."
1,Poorly written story,"I read this book in a day and, like another reviewer, I'm sending it straight to the giveaway bin. The writing style was more like a beginning writer than one with the experience of Jude Devereaux. There was no sizzle between the characters, and I'm not sure I even cared about either one in the end. I got so sick of both of them keeping their secrets, that I figured they deserved to get caught and held forever by the coven! This book skimmed the plot and characters and lacked something more potent to hold it all together."
1,IT [was] SO BAD!,I WAS SO DISSAPOINTED IN THIS BOOK THE SEX WERE NONEXISTENT .ARE WE SURE THAT JUDE DEVERAUX IS WRITING THESE BOOKS. IF SHE IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WAY SHE USED WRITE HER OLD BOOKS WHEN I FIRST STARTED READING HER BOOKS. ANY TRUE DEVERAUX FAN WOULD KNOW THE WAY HER WRITING SKILLS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS.
2,Not as good as JD's other books,"As said previously, read JD's other books. Much more interesting than this one. The characters are weak - the heroine is childish, the hero is irritable, the plot details are sketchy, the romance is off and unbelievable. The ending is vague and just thrown together. The only character that looks interesting but has too few pages/ lines is Putnam."
2,Read only if you have to read everything by Jude D,"I give this book two stars for being written by Ms. Deveraux and having a Montgomery in it, otherwise I wouldn't have wasted my time. It is a far cry from her usual style, almost science-fiction/mystery NOT good romance. The storyline goes way over the top and there is no character exploration. I never really felt like I knew any of the players. I do not intend to read any of the sequels."
2,Disappointing,"I normally love Jude Deveraux but I found this trilogy lacking her usual story telling flair. Her books usually draw me in, but I had to make myself finish this series."
1,One of the worst book ever.,"This book was so boring. I bought this book a few years ago and thank god it was cheaper than the regular price. I would have been mad, I wasted $8 on this book. On the other hand, this book wasn't worth any of my money at all.I was half way into the book and found it uninteresting. It was incredibly boring and the characters seem like they have not been developed at all. I don't know what went through JD's mind when she wrote this book. I got furious when the female character threw herself at the gorgeous Montgomery. They both seem like they don't connect.I hope JD's new books are better than this and keep her fans interested like Sweet Liar."
1,Disapointed,I have read all of Jude Deveraux and I feel she didn't put her heart into this book. Normally it takes me 1 to 2 days to read one of her books this one I kept hoping would get better but it took me 2 weeks to read and that is because i forced myself to. I feel also that this was a fast written book to put something on the shelfs but I felt it was a waste of money.
1,Rush ending,"I am a great fan of Jude Deveraux's. I love the Montgomery books and most leave me wanting more however this one didn't. There were several times when the change in setting and focus left me saying ""WHAT?"" and I had to reread to figure out who was where and what was happening. [I should only have to do this if I put the book down for a long time and a these books are a two hour read for me.] What happened to Montgomery's parents was very out of the family story line so I had a very hard time with belief now if it had been her parents and Montgomery was the one with the sight then well... The ending was very bad. I felt as if the author lost interest [or the editor was screaming shorter shorter] near the end so it was a slapped condensed version of what should have been much much better. Instead it left me with a he said then she said feeling. The book left me sorry I didn't pick it up at a library book sale for a quarter. Advice get it from the library if you feel you must read it."
2,Deveraux's attempt at the suspense/horror genre was mediocre,"Don't get me wrong, I love and own EVERY Jude Deveraux book, but this departure from historical/modern day romance felt awkward & thrown together.The heroine, Darci T. Monroe, wasn't very believable and the hero, Adam Montgomery, lacked depth. Parts of the book didn't seem to be well thought-out, which was disappointing.The highlights of this book were scenes where the famous Montgomery money was used in fabulous shopping/makeover scenes...My recommendation is to buy ""Summerhouse"" instead. It is classic Deveraux that is beautifully written with characters people can identify with."
2,Forever? Maybe to read.,"I love Jude Deveraux. Since A Kight in Shinning Armor. I am a very loyal fan of hers, although I don't get her new books right away.This is a very disappointing book. I could not get into the story. It was slow moving. Too much worthless details. I could not identify with the lead character.I was just plain disappointed with this book."
1,The last Jude Deveraux book I will read.,"I have been a fan of Jude Deveraux's for many years, but if this is any indication of the new direction she is taking with her writing I will find another author to spend my money on. The prologue is the best part of the book. I didn't believe any of the characters. Who would write a book about an antagonist who is so stupid she doesn't use her magic mirror to find out that losing her virginity will cause her to lose her powers and a mother who cares so little for her child that the child lives a street person type of existance, but shows up to sacrifice her life for her daughter's? This could have been a really good book if the author had taken time to make the characters real and not cheat the readers with basically two epilogues instead of a real ending."
3,"Not Her Best, But Not The Worst Either!!","This is not the best story that Ms. Deveraux has written but it is not the worst either. Darci T. Monroe was a kick. She was funny and quirky. This is another story about Ms. Deveraux's Montgomery Clan. I found it to be entertaining and fast paced. The charaters were fun, the storyline although out there was also entertaining. Don't expect this book to be like her older stories or you will be let down. Judge this book on the basis of this book."
2,Disappointing,"The prologue begins with a decent opening, giving the reader the impression that he/she'll be in for a good fantasy ride. The build-up to the point of the story was OK, but a bit dragged out. Too much time was spent focusing on the usual attraction between the lead protagonists (Darci and Adam) and not enough on Darci's journey of discovery of her ""supernatural abilities"". The climax of the story when Darci is supposed to defeat the evil witch is too rushed. The reader is left wanting to see exactly how Darci eventually disposes of her and the life and death struggle that ensues. All in all, I found the story unbelievable and unrealistic."
3,What? No climax?,"You'd think such a prolific writer of romance novels would know better than to leave readers hanging. I enjoyed this book thoroughly until the last chapter. The novel has lots of romance, charming characters, and spooky witchcraft...but then the whole thing falls apart with a flashback report of the big showdown. Did Jude have a deadline? Was she reluctant to show the heroine's awesome powers? Ultimately, the author copped out. This book has themes that are very dark - but she couched them in a light, airy romance. The ending could have been very dark and powerful. Too bad!My advice to readers is - go ahead and buy the book! It's fun and engaging (just be prepared to be annoyed by the ending).My advice to the author - don't be afraid to mix the romance with a touch more horror. I want good to triumph - but I don't mind seeing the battle!"
1,One of Jude D.'s worst books.,"If I could have given this book no stars I would have. I own virtually every Jude Deveraux book and have read her for 14 years. Though witchcraft isn't my thing, I bought this book anyway b/c it featured a Montgomery. Boy, was that a mistake. The plot was implausible. The characters unlikeable. And I can't believe she killed off some Montgomerys! She hasn't written a good book since ""Sweet Liar."" Each year the books get progressively worse. I haven't even bothered to read the sequel."
5,I just love Judes books,This is the very first book I read by Deveraux.I have since then read almost all of her books.Most being enjoyable.I just loved this book.Adam Montgomery is such a hunk.Of coarse Jude fans what montgomery isn't.Darcey was very intersting and funny.The first of a trilogy
4,Intriguing and enjoyable fast read,"This trilogy takes you into another world. Whike the first book is the best one, you still have to read the entire trilogy to experience all the magic this story has to offer. The books start out slow, but become hard to put down once you get into them."
1,Simply Unbelievable!,"This book was plain awful! It reads like it was written by a 10 year old. Actually, my 10 year old could write better stuff than this! The characters were flat and the dialogue was stupid. I give the publisher an A for writing an intriguing blurb on the back cover that made me pick it up. The premise was very interesting and could have made a fantastic story. I will say this though: I do find myself having to at least finish it because I do want to know how it ends. But that's all it has going for it."
2,dissappointed,"At first, I was glad to see Ms. Deveraux wrote a Montgomery/Taggart book again...Until I read to the middle of the novel. It was unbelievable...and not in a good way, either. The novel was rushed and though she has done fairy tales before (wishes come to mind and remembrance, too) it's like her novels have lost the detail and rhythm lately. I prefer her earlier works."
1,Mirror Mirror on the Wall........,Ms. Deveraux should have looked in her bewitching mirror and seen how many fans she was going to disappoint with this book. Don't waste your money or your time on this one! (I guess I should have bought that hot fudge sundae instead)!
1,Absolute Worst Book She has Written,"I'm a huge J.D. Fan but this book made me question my taste. To say it was awful is an understatement. The only reason I kept on reading it was to see if there was a ""GOTCHA-- JUDE DIDN'T WRITE THIS"" somewhere. Unfortunately there was nothing like that and I wasted a good 2 weeks of my time. Yes it took me 2 weeks to read this book because it was so bad. Normally it takes 2 days."
1,I CAN'T BELIEVE DEVERAUX WROTE THIS,"I have read all of Deveraux's books and loved them but this was a farce. No plot, no climax--the entire book was an anticlimax. I have come to expect more from her Montgomery-Taggart stories and this was one big disappointment."
3,Magic! Ehhh.,"The newest Jude Deveraux novel is very different from most of her others with psychics, witches, and magic mirrors, she goes a little further in this book than in Rembrance, and Sweet Liar. Adam is a MONTGOMERY and he meets Darci the female lead character when she answers an ad. Some of the book was a little corny with Darci being about the goofiest person ever. She and Adam don't really have that much chemistry that I can see its like Ms. Deveraux is running out of Montgomery's to write about so she just uses one of her throw away type men. I did enjoy the secondary storyline characters' romance though not much detail was given about this either. Believe it or not there is not one sexy scene in this book and it does kind of drag along until a bang up finish at the end which was a little too pat and cutsie. I thought this book was just o.k. but don't rush out and buy it just because you like this author. Darci must have used her true persuasion on me to get me to buy it."
2,She was soooooo annoying!!,"I am sorry, but the leading lady was so annoying, I couldn't stand her obssession with money, I don't care that after all itwas for a good cause.And other thing I didn't like was that larger than life Montgomerys could be killed, they are heroe, no matter where or when.And the mother going from I don't care a bit about you to I am going to save you, come on!!!!"
2,WHat happened???,"I tried many times, but still cannot finish the book. It's just very very bad storyline and not good settings.HOpe Jude Deveraux's next book would be better."
3,not the best,"I am reading Forever now and am more than halfway done.I am somewhat disappointed that there is not much in the wayof magic to the story. The romance is somewhat plain.I recommended A Knight in shining Armor to a friend but,this one is nowhere near as good."
3,How annoying,"Jude Devereaux's Forever... was interesting reading. However, as a writer myself, I had a lot of trouble with the fact that Adam Montgomery was always ""annoyed"". I soon realized the author was using that word (or a form of it) so often, I began to count. It was used to describe Adam's feelings ten times in the first hundred pages. I stopped counting after that, but, believe me, he continued to be annoyed throughout the book. I wouldn't be surprised if the word was used thirty times. Also, Adam was always ""snapping"" at people. Methinks Ms. Devereaux should avail herself of a good thesaurus!"
2,I expected better...,"Having read Jude Deveraux's other novels, I looked forward to reading this. Unfortunately, in comparison to her other novels, I found it to be a huge disappointment and just not as interesting or of the same caliber as some of her other books. Those looking for a great Jude Deveraux book would do better to check out Sweet Liar, Remembrance, or a Knight in Shining Armor."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"First, I love Jude Deveraux. However, this book seems like she just got tired of writing the story so she said THE END! Darci is not a truly likable person and the relationship she instantly establishes with her father is ludicrous! She describes fully what happens to the family of Adam, but when it comes to the final showdown.....suddenly we're one year later with no explanation of how it was all accomplished!!This should not have been listed as a romance as there is only ONE kiss in the entire book!"
5,Easy read,As with the comments on all her novels Jude Deveraux always delivers. Her characters jump out of the page. Can't wait for more.
3,"Good story, but...","I gave this book 3 stars because I was really disappointed in the climax. I read like a crazy woman to get to the big confrontation and then it just ended. There really wasn't a ""battle""I would still recommend reading this book, many parts of it were very entertaining, just don't stay up till nearly dawn trying to get to the ending!"
1,Unreadable,"If this novel is typical of the author's work, I have to wonder how she ever achieved her reputation. The story is terrible; the heroine not just oddball but genuinely repugnant and geeky. There is no logic to the hero's attraction to her; she puts their lives in danger, does stupid and unattractive things, she snoops, she's insufferably smug, she's written as pathetic trailer trash, and yet this handsome and supposedly intelligent man...well, it may be the fantasy of some women out there to be able to win the handsome prince, no matter how much of a toad she may act, but this was not entertaining.I didn't care about the plot, because I didn't care about the protagonists. I detested them.I couldn't finish this book, and wish I hadn't spent my money on it."
2,Mediocre at best,"Like many of you, I have been reading Jude Deveraux for a long time. Also, like many of you, I buy her books just because she wrote them. This time, I wish I would have read the customer reviews before I took the time to read the book. I can't say it was a waste of my time. The book wasn't awful. It was just disappointing to me. I kept waiting for something else ... that never happened.After writing for a period of time some authors seem to become bored with what they have been writing and try to branch out. I understand that. This just seemed to be too much of a branch out for me. I am so used to Jude Deveraux providing a GOOD love story that this one just fell flat for me.In the past, when an author has moved too far away from my reasons for reading their work I have found it easier to just let their books sit on store shelves. I'm not too sure that I'm not at that point with Jude."
2,Never again!,"I am a big Jude Deveraux fan. I loved her earlier work - the Velvet Saga was awesome, the Princess was hilarious and Sweet Liar a treasure. I have to say that I'm getting more and more disappointed in her new work. I can't say I enjoyed this book at all - it was confusing and very dark, but I don't think that's how it was intended. There is no real spark or connection between any of the characters and that just makes it disturbing to read. I recommend you borrow this at your local library and save yourself the money."
4,I like it,"I bought this because it was on sale. I didnt think it would work better than the older one I already had, but it was time for a new one - and like I said it was on sale.It is great. It works much better than the one I have. And knowing how well it works, I would buy it even if it wasnt on sale. It takes me half the time it used to to do my hair.I really like this product."
4,Works great,This straightener works great! The base heats up the wand pretty quickly (about a minute) and it stays hot long enough to straighten half way around with 2-ft hair.
3,sorry game,i actually like the game but can not use it as it's not compatible with my computer which has windows 7 or my laptop which has vista. i already had this same game. i got the new one thinking it had been upgraded to the newer programs.
1,Price refects quality.,"I had great hopes for this camera, but none where fulfilled, except for the great price. I got this camera and immediately began to use it. It holds an incredible amount of pictures, but the problem is with the quality of the pictures. The quality is terrible. I took over 100 pictures with this camera at all resolutions and the pictures were incredibly blurry. Only about 10, out of the 100 plus pictures, were ok quality (not very good quality at that). It takes forever for this camera to be ready to even take the pictures and it is temperamental about taking pictures after that. The camera took picture very sporadically. The web cam feature is bad as well. It came in very choppy. ..."
2,Great potential that needs development,"This is the Brownie of the digital cameras. If you know exactly what this camera is capable of, you can get good pictures, but not great ones. The picture capacity, was the main selling feature I was interested in. I would recommend waiting for D-link to come out with DSC-450 or 500 with a flash shoe, better lens( maybe a zoom ), and better light sensing electronics."
2,Not Fully Functional,"The DSC-350 took great still shots despite the fact that it needed a lot of light. Unfortunately, when I tried to set it up as a webcam I encountered a lot of problems with the driver installation. The driver that comes with the cam does not work in WinME; and the driver available for download at the D-Link website is no better (in fact, it's the same driver). The available patch did not help, either. D-Link tech support could offer no answers...."
1,d-link digital camera,"I ordered this camera last October. I tried to load the driver on my PC, and it just wouldn't set up right. I don't know if others had this problem or not...apparently not the other people who reviewed this camera. At first I thought it was a problem with the camera, so I sent the first one back, and got another, but I still couldn't get the driver to load."
5,The very best,"I have this camera I am ordering another one for my sister. I have used it as a web cam, I have a son in service(Army)stationed in Germany,I am very pleased with the picture quality,and ease of use."
1,not as good as i thought,"im the same kid that reviewed this camera before. the shutter stays open way too long. Most of my pictures were blurry. the video started messing up after awhile, too. i wouldn't recomend this camera. I sent mine back and am now buying an Olympus D460. sorry if you bought this camera because of my previous review."
2,Drive In,"I first saw this movie in the 1970s, back when the genre washot. I grew up on the genre and would love to see it again (the 747was cool)."
1,DRIVE-IN,"UPDATE: I have now received the correct movie. You must order a new copy directly from Amazon. The 2 used copies I received both contained the wrong movie........................................................................................................This manufactured on demand DVD-R does not contain the correct movie. The movie on the disc is Boston Blacktie, not DRIVE-IN. I thought this was a fluke, but my second copy had the same problem."
4,Priceless movie-within-the-movie,"I saw ""Drive-In"" at a real drive-in in 1976 -- and then I watched it on HBO countless times afterward.The main characters of ""Drive-In"" were forgettable, but I'll NEVER forget ""Disaster '76,"" the ""movie"" that's showing at the drive-in that's the subject of ""Drive-In.""""Disaster '76"" was a parody of every Seventies disaster movie from Jaws to Airport '75 to The Towering Inferno and more. ""Campy"" was an understatement.If you're old enough to have suffered through Seventies disaster flicks (and maybe even if you're younger), you'll chuckle at the tacky special effects and deliberately bad scripting of ""Disaster '76."" I wouldn't be surprised if the writers of ""Airplane!"" (1980) found some inspiration in this earlier flick.""Drive-In"" is, in essence, a movie-within-a-movie, shown in the Seventies at a drive-in-within-a-drive-in."
5,Drive In,"Watched this movie on hbo back in the 70's! Country music, multline plots and just enough one liners to get it done. The movie is probably a bit acronistic, haven't seen the stars in anything else, and there are millions of people who would not watch this flick. But it's just right for a feel good 90 minutes!"
3,Classic slice of N. Texas/all small Southern towns 1976,Classic. Enjoyable. Sophomoric/camp humor works. Great way to show kids what this period was like...and how great drive in's were/are. What happened to the cast?
4,Love it.,"This movie is up there with the Debut. Great indie movie dealing with coming of age and finding your Asian American identity. It's a cute, feel-good date movie. Loved the actors. Never seen them before, but will be looking out for them. This is one of a handful of Asian American movies which mark its maturity from the early days of movies like American Adobo."
3,Buy this 3rd,"I had added ""Ball and Chain"" ( PG) and ""Dude, Where""s the Party? (PG) ""to my collection some months back. Both featured the actor Kal Penn of Harold & Kummar . . . The recomendation off Amazon looked ok for ""American Chai ""(R) so I purchased it. Other than some R rated language it is about like a TV movie . After watching it I am glad 1.)I bought it used and 2.) cheap. It may have won an Audience Award at the Slamdance Film Festival but it is inferior to either of the two movies listed above. I would advise you to purchase either one before you watch this one. Rent it maybe but to me its not worth having in my collection."
2,Disappointment,Second region free DVD that I purchased from this vendor - while they both started out fine after a short time they would only play non-region 1 disks. Region 1 disks for the US started skipping. I thought that maybe it was a fluke with the first unit but it is the same with the second unit (different brand). I am not happy.
1,DVD player out of order,"Our DVD player was out of order after 11 months of duty only, incredible !......This is not acceptable.Guy Romain Fort lauderdale, Florida"
5,Grandchildren loved!,"Both of my grandchildren like this movie, but my grandson watches it over and over again. It has a great message. Its okay to be different."
5,The movie you *want* your kids to watch.,"My child brought the The Wisdom of Friends as a checkout from the library. The disk was well-used, plenty of scratches and scuffs. There's a reason for that. Kids really like this movie and don't mind watching it over and over. Once I saw it and realized what important lessons it was teaching my child, I had to buy a copy. Well worth it, and I recommend watch it with your child at least once."
2,A bit annoying,"I was looking for a non-scary movie for my 2.5 yr old girl, beyond just Barney, Pooh and Tinkerbell. I don't like this movie very much - Sarah one of the dinosaurs is negative and makes fun of the other dinosaurs and I don't want my daughter emulating her. There is a few slightly scary parts with the T-Rexs that are chasing them, but seemed ok for my 2.5 year old. If I have to watch a movie with my daughter, I would recommend Up or Tinkerbell first."
1,Poorly thought out and pointless,"My daughter and I picked this up and watched it last night. Ugh. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and sorely regret buying it for my daughter. The movie purports to be about little foot learning the ""wisdoms"" from his grandparents and then going on an adventure applying them, but instead it winds up mocking the idea of listening and thinking about what you're doing. The comedic yellow-bellied dinos wind up providing a sort of praise for stupidity and debasement of the wisdoms. It encourages children to ignore lessons of their parents and just do whatever feels good to them at the time.To summarize the lessons this movie teaches: Kids, it's okay not to listen to your parents. Feel free to wander off with any strange kids you meet in the neighborhood. If you've been told not to do something, but it feels right at the moment, go ahead and do it anyway. Parents don't know that much anyway."
5,One of the all time greatest recordings,"I am so glad to be able to finally listen to this without the crackles and pops on my vinyl to tape recording.This is the album that sets Fahey on a pinnacle of guitar virtuosity and creative genius. It is as much an exporation of sound as it is an emotional tour de force as Fahey zigs, zags, and pirouettes from the still center into hypersonic overdrive across a moody and melodic soundscape.I first heard this on an old Tom Donahue radio show on KMPX in SF in 1967. I was sitting in a parlor in Oakland and was just blown away completely and still am.I even like what some call ""filler.""When ""Days Have Gone By"" finally gets rereleased my Fahey void will be filled."
5,Great Product!,This is the best shaper I have ever worn! It is comfortable yet controls like nothing else I have ever owned...I would highly recomend it!
1,It rolls down -doesn't stay in place-got a run the first time,I was not as impressed as other reviewers- and I looked at the other reviewers to see how many reviews they actually have written-most wrote only this ONE! That makes me wonder if they are really Lipo employees.The first time I put it on - I got a run. They roll and don't stay put. They are like strong nylons. Not actually a foundation. So getting a run that grows is a possibility. I do not think they are worth the money and I am sorry I bought them.
1,What a huge waste!!,"I was so excited when I finally received this. All I wanted was some smoothing-did't expect to shrink 2 sizes. Well, it did smooth some, but the result wasn't as good as I get from a better brand control top panty hose. If you're looking for back and tummy smoothing, it's okay. However, if you're looking for help from the waist down, especially for the thighs, don't waste your money."
5,"Lipo High Waist Capri, exactly what I wanted.","This is exactly what I wanted and I am so pleased I made this purchase. This item retails for about $80. I found it here for $50. I love it, it smooths in all the right places and as long as it's worn properly (which does take a few minutes longer than slinging on a typical girtle) it does not roll or bind in any way. I love it. It even comes with a mesh bag for machine washing. It is a little heavier than a set of control top hose not as heavy as a full on girtle so wearing it during the summer was comfortable. I will definitely make this purchase again when necessary."
3,found the trick to make this fold paper better,i work at an office that has one of these. After struggling with it b/c it would never fold the paper without really creasing it I took the back feed-in plastic panel off and just feed the paper in by hand. it works so much better. It hasn't creased one paper yet. Seems durrable and worth the price if you take the back plastic panel off. if you don't you'll regret purchasing this b/c with that feed-in panel on it ruined 8 out of 10 folds.
2,Neat Device...Before It Broke,"I really didn't have too high hopes for the APF300 paper folder since it was so inexpensive...and that was good since it started to ""eat"" papers and/or unevenly make folds on the second day of light use. By the third day it refused to shut off and constantly ran when plugged in (it is supposed to ""autostart"" when a paper is inserted in the feed slot).It is too inexpensive and too heavy of a product to be worth my time/money to return. We will take the loss and chalk it up as a life lesson...you get what you pay for. We will be buying a more expensive one in the very near future.I do not recommend this product."
1,terrible,Just bought this and it has yet to fold 1 piece of paper correctly. i have gone through about 20 sheets of paper so far. fed one by one. what am i doing wrong? DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
3,"Royal, at times.","This is a nice machine, but sometimes it pulls the paper too fast and does not fold perfectly. Also, I get little black dust on the paper that wipes off. For the price, it is a good machine. I just bought it for convenience and wish it used batteries instead of electricity."
5,Wonderful machine,We purchased one of these folders for a political campaign in 2008 folded thousands (To many to count)of sheets of paper with very few problems. In April of this year we started another political campaign and so far in the last month have folded almost 8000 sheets of paper with the old letter folder. Had a few problems but finally figured out that i did not have the sheet feeder installed correctly.I would recommend this to anyone.
3,I needed a tri folder that was in-expensive,"A little hard to get used to because it would grab the paper and was not very forgiving and I had many creases. But after I got use to it it worked pretty good, I still creased a few papers but all said and done it was worth the $30. Excellent seller and very prompt."
3,Worked OK for a while,"This thing worked OK for about a year. I probably fold 300 pieces a quarter and at least 5 would end up wrinkled. The guides are not good enough to hold the paper straight on insertion. As it feeds deeper, it is forced to straighten out and gets wrinkled no matter how careful you are. After about a year, it started to misfeed everything and eventually stopped completely. In a way, I'm glad it did because it made me realize that paperless receipts are a better way to go."
4,More than just decoration,This book is the most comprehensive henna book I've come across! I loved learning about the historical and cultural significance of mehndi. The pictures are gorgeous!
3,Okay for fun,"When I was completely new to henna, I found this book fun. Now, while I am no expert, I think there are better on-line how-to's such as at mehandi.com (and no, I don't work for them). I'm still only an occasional henna slinger, so this book has some inspiring patterns. If this is your first book on henna though, I would suggest doing some more research. The above mentioned website has a great deal of free information and patterns."
3,Not a ton of information,This book would be good for beginners but for people who have done Henna for a long time it's pretty basic stuff :(
5,Mehndi Art,"Being an artist myself, I was very pleased with this book. I like to know the background of whatever I am about to make and this book does just that. It tells the history, and background of where and why Mehndi was done. Not only did it reveal a great history, but it also tells you exactly what kind of Henna Powder to look for when you buy your own. I have nothing but raves for the sources it gives to purchase the finest grade of henna powder. But you will have to read the book to find out where to get it. (I'll give you a hint: it's in Seattle)"
1,No Pictures all words no patterns,"Lucky I brought this cheap.I would not bother with this one.There is a little bit of tiny designs on some pages. Overall though, not anything very useful.SKIP IT CHIEF!"
5,A beautiful book that is both practical and spiritual,"What a pleasure this book is. I knew nothing about the art of mehndi except vague associations with National Geographic and some celebrities. How much more there is to this timeless art form, practised by women all over the world, including Roome, the author. Whether you enjoy looking at the gorgeous pictures and drawings, or learning about the history and rituals behind the henna tattoes, this book has something for everyone. It was so inspiring, I wanted to run out and find the nearest mehndi artist so I could try it!"
4,"Great, but less than I expected","My 3 year old loves the puzzles games, and has them down pat. And that's the problem. He has gone over the same things so much, that there is no more challenge to the game. I wish someone would put out a children's game that evolved enough to keep their attention. Maybe we will have to wait for DVD games before so much can be put on one disk."
4,Triumph,As a spinner of ghost lore Nancy Roberts can't be beat. Not the most chilling of Mrs. Roberts works but still well worth the price. Before anyone interested in ghosts takes a trip to South Carolina they should read this book. In fact anyone interested in ghosts should probably check out all of Mrs. Roberts books. I'm hooked.
3,South Carolina Ghost,The stories in this book were too short not enough information on the ghost.It could have been a lot better if the stories were longer and more detailed.
4,Republished under a New Name,"Very good book. And you don't have to buy it used - it's recently been republished, as ""The Queen's Command""."
3,Basic Freshwater Fishing,A good book for the beginning fisherman. I was disappointed that there was not more information on the presentation of the various artificial lures.
3,Great book for beginners,"The book is exactly what it's titled. It's full of Basic fishing knowledge. Great for beginners, not really usefull for anybody with a little experience."
2,Poor quality overall,"I read all the glowing reviews on all the other sites and really was excited to get a hold of this monitor. Installation was a snap and material is high quality. BUT.. the display quality is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable for anyone doing graphic work or photo-retouching. I quickly switched back to my 19"" Sony G400 (4 year old) within a few days and waiting to return this monitor tomorrow. Definitely not worth the money. Problems were:-vertical artifacts on the sides of the screen-VERY bad convergence.. long horizontal dashed lines did not line up straight-Things are too sharp on the edges and too fuzzy in the middleJust horrible to use for someone who works in graphic design. And for those who can quickly tell what is good or bad, you will be severely disappointed. If you are a gamer, you might be okay with it."
4,Excellent Monitor,"I purchased this monitor to replace a 17"" that I've been using since 1995. I spent quite a bit of time researching monitors on the web and this monitor consistently got high marks; one of the popular PC magazines gave it a ""Best Buy"" recommendation. Set up was a snap and the driver CD was not required for Windows XP, pure ""Plug-n-Play"". The picture is crisp, due to a high level of resolution and a bright display -- one of the brightest I've ever seen (the Magic Bright feature is very nice). The monitor supports a number of resolutions and is capable of very high refresh rates, so there's no flicker to tire your eyes. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase."
2,pink cadillac,I love the movie but ! it has been so chopped up from W B. That it is almost hard to follow. I have the original on VHS and it is very different.
5,Fantastic mystery,"A thoroughly engaging read, filled with historical interest, amazing characters, and a story line that makes an all night read inevitable. Scenes of St. Louis fur trade politics and US Army collapse in 1812 campaign in Great Lakes theater were fascinating. I was stunned at the elegance and complexity of the dialogues between the characters--a new high in sophistication. Burns meant to write a mystery with a backdrop of historical events. It is not an historical opus. Question: Did Meriwether get drugged throughout this book, did he have malaria, or was he unbalanced? Author does not answer these possibilities."
5,Amazing,"""As the Rush Comes"" is one of the top 5 trance songs I have ever heard. It kills me that I can't find more material from Motorcycle. Check out the Chillout Remix. It is just as good. If you know your electronic music, I promise you, this one won't dissappoint."
5,Real Rock and Roll Lives On,"If you are a fan of simple straight ahead Rock and Roll, Rockabilly, and Country then this CD is a must have. The album sounds like it came right out of the late 50's early 60's. Deke combines the afore mentioned styles and makes them his own with amazing results. Rhythm Rhyme and Truth will appeal to a broad base of fans from Country to Rock. A well written album with great music. The only thing better than this cd is catching them live."
4,Does Not Hold up Quite That Well Over Time!,"When I first saw this movie in the theatre about 26 years ago, it was definitely super hilarious. In fact, I returned a few days later to check it out a 2nd time! Some of the scenes, especially at the pre-wedding dinner were and are hilarious, and everthing in 1980 about the film seemed kookily and crazily off-beat with enough eccentic personnel to bring on dozens of out- loud laughs. Though still funny and very amusing, today it does seem somewhat dated with over-caricatured characters bordering on stereo-types. In fact the 2 most likable personages are the young future groom and his bride, even if they are also by far the dullest, and least interesting. Also, (obviously) AIDS has come about after this movie was made (or at least made much more public), and this recent past definitely puts a somber light on this mainly fun loving and very likable and amusing picture."
3,Parley Vous ?,"Once having viewed ""The Birdcage"" (Robin Williams/Nathan Lane) This Frenchy ""La Cage "" is a let down. Maybe half the laughs ? Only in English subtitle version. Acting is reasonably good, but comedy effort, if there at all ? is very subtle. Should a person buy his flick or should it be passed over ? It's a toss up. If you understand the French language, go for it !"
3,La Cage vs. Bird Cage,"For all the foreign movie snobs who hail La Cage as the the masterpiece which enabled the Robin Williams - Nathan Lane 90's knockoff --- give it a rest. As one who saw The Birdcage first - this 1978 French farse set on the Riviera and populated with foppish dandies falls flat and vapid in almost every aspect when compared with the crackling performance of Williams and Lane and the thermonuclear setting of South Beach. Indeed, the only redeaming feature of this bore is its spawning of The Birdcage."
4,Birdcage Mark 1,"This is the original film on which The Birdcage is based. It is a little sharper in every respect, but just as funny. While in The Birdcage you know all along that everybody's joking, the actors play it for real here. You never doubt that these are committed homosexuals living in a long-term relationship. The highlight is the outrageous male maid - a laugh at every turn.Although nominally about a gay relationship, this is really just another of Francois Weber's brilliant ""buddy"" movies, one of the first in a long tradition that includes Tais Toi and The Dinner Game as particular highlights. Weber has a superlative grasp on the comedy archetype: the set-up, the tangle of confusions, the resolution and the moral. Few people in movies have had such a clear and consistent grasp of the demands of comedy. And, as with his other great comedies, this one packs a great moral punch.By the way, nowadays Weber is both writer and director; in La Cage Aux Folles he was one of the four writers."
1,THIS IS AN ENGLISH DUBBED VERSION,"The fact that this particular title, the original French production indeed, is DUBBED IN ENGLISH is not indicated appropriately in the title for the listing. This is BAD. I paid my $2.99 and a mere 5-10 seconds past the credits discovered this awful fact. I stopped the vid at the 2 minute mark, didn't watch another second of it, never re-opened it, then tooled about Amazon ""all"" (confinement to the ""prime vids area was a joke beyond measure) in search of a means for (a) exchange and/or (b) refund. Nothing. So folks, if you light up this film hoping to hear the dulcet tones of Mssr Serrault, you shall be sorely -- SORELY! -- disappointed.La Cage Aux Folles"
3,Hello! Obvisouly you don't have any Mac friends. . .,"I think Outburt is an awesome game. My cousin has it and Ialways play it at her house. It was made by the same people whocreated 'You Don't Know Jack,' but Outbust, unlike Jack, gives you questions about stuff you know about, and itsn't 100% all-out disgusting.Your probably asked why I gave this awesome game a '3' if I love it so much. I'll explain. I wish I could get my self a copy, but Hasbro doesn't make a version for Mac. (...)If Outburst, the best game I've ever played, had a Mac version, I would give it a 10+.(...)"
5,We love this game!,"We received this game for Christmas last year and we love it. Whenever we mention playing it when we have people over everyone jumps at the chance. Sometimes people come over just to play! We have been playing it for a year now and we are seeing some of the same questions. We're waiting on some kind of upgrade to the game or another version. It is easier than ""You don't know Jack"", which makes it more fun to play with people of different degrees of knowledge. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an exciting and rowdy game for parties or just for something to do when you are bored."
3,Pretty disappointing,"I really had expected more from this game. While it's enjoyable on some levels, the questions are often ridiculous - either totally random and impossible to answer or a litle too basic. And some of the graphics and such are really annoying. It's basically simply an 'all right' game - for anyone interested in challenging, stimulating word games I would recommend... something else."
2,pa system included only the microphone,"I think the ad is a bit misleading in that it is not a ""system"", but only a portable microphone which does not work without the speaker, which is shown but not included. I returned the microphone almost 3 weeks ago and have not yet been credited with the refund."
2,"Cute, but.....","The illustrations are darling and the story is cute to a point. I think the ending could have been done better especially with the Momma cat saying she could have another litter, I know it's just a kids book, but as someone that does pet rescue and sees the number of animals killed in shelters each year this book left me regretting my decision to buy it.I have a rescued basset hound so I really did like the illustrations."
4,Dog Who Had Kittens,This is a wonderful children's book that adults will also enjoy! It shows children/adults how to have compassion for others.
5,A wonderful book for all ages,"This book is charming to say the least. To say the most the illustrations are wonderfully accurate of a basset hound and the story is one of the most wonderful I have read in a long time. Everyone has heard the stories of animals fostering other animals babies, this is a wonderful adaptation of that theme for all ages."
4,This is a great video!!!,"This is a great video. It shows Chevy Chase doing Gerald Ford, Andy Kaufman doing his own special performance, Dan Aykroyd with his Comercial Parodie Mel's Char Palace, the very first land shark sketch, Gilda Radner doing Emily Litella, Candic Bergen imitating Catherine Deneuve and much more."
4,Mislabeled Platfform Use,I ordered this product because it was listed as being compatible with the Mac platform. When it arrived (ahead of the scheduled time) it was clear that it does not support the Mac platform. I contacted the vendor and they agreed that the description was in error and promptly refunded my money. I appreciate the immediate attention to my problem and would use this vendor in the future if they have Mac products. I understand that it is an excellent product for the appropriate platforms.
5,Very Handy,"I'm an Infrastructure Consultant and find myself in data centers all the time. Sometimes they have the necessary outlets for my laptop, but frequently the PDUs don't. This power adapter has become a Must Have for my bag when I travel."
5,Excellente!!!,This rollers skate was the bomb!!! Gave it to my twin daughters for christmas and they love santa......they say he is the best!!!
5,"GREAT SKATES, GREAT PRICE!!!","I bought these skates for my niece who loves to skate at our local roller rink. She absolutely loves them. She can't wait for Saturday to come, because she knows that's the day she'll be skating. Great skates at a great price!"
4,Great Skates,"Fun Sturdy Skates. My daughter loves them, and I bought a pair for her friend so they could skate together. They have a ball."
4,Great for the price!,"My daughter loves these because they are Barbie and pink with sparkle wheels.We got them for a great deal on Amazon with free shipping.The wheels barely spin,but that was good for our daughter since she is just learning to skate.In comparison to the ones we saw at the sporting goods stores,these were better quality(and the ones at the other stores were triple the price!)."
1,awful and incorrect,"This is a misleading work in its entirety, especially the history section. Both the text and the drawings look like they came from WWII era history books. Recent re-evaluations of Ottoman historical records have led to a dramatic change of perspective, by eminent scholars such as Heath Lowry and Rhoads Murphey, on everything from the non-Turkish contributions to the founding of the empire (2 out of the 4 founders were Catalan mercenaries in Byzantine employ), to the reason why ""gazi state"" is a complete misnomer, and finally the pragmatism and flexibility in military organization that led to such brilliant early successes. These and many other essential factors are missing here. I would strongly recommend not wasting resources on this shoddy relic, and instead sampling more recent scholarly works, including ones by the aforementioned authors, and downloading more accurate and better drawn pictures of Ottoman soldiers for free on the web."
2,"For hard-core B, S & T fans only.","What a big disappointment this is. The band just ran out of ideas for good music and should have disbanded rather than put out this junk. Their first two albums are great, their 3rd one not bad, but after that they are all very poor."
2,Chrome plated plastic,"This is a simple one - it's a shower arm. It looks great in the pictures with flats to ease installation with a wrench! However, the pipe is plastic and does not feel very sturdy. Given that people pull on the shower head to re-aim the water, something metal seems like a better choice. Luckily, Amazon has a great return policy (it went back)."
5,Wonderfully smooth,"The tracks flow effortlessly from beginning to end, without a filler song in the bunch. After listening a few times you will never have the, ""ugh, I hate the beat on the this"" problem that plagues some lesser-quality dubby bands.Highlights, after listening to the CD for awhile, are pretty much every song. I became really interested in dZihan & Kamien after hearing the song ""Streets of Istanbul,"" though, which is a good introduction to the CD. ""Slowhand Hussein"" is also another good string-tinged tune.These beats are great for studying to or falling asleep - this CD was a heavy part of the soundtrack of my just-finished semester of college, and it was good soundtrack music!"
2,Not anything special,"--The bad-- The biggest problem that I have with this album is it's tendancy to come off as Smooth Jazz. The only thing that keeps it from being played on the Smooth Jazz stations it seems is it's occasional beeps and blips generated by cliche analog synths. Everything is right around 100bpm and falls inbetween exciting and downtempo. I imagine these guys are 'nice people to know'.The keyboard parts are particularly boring. You can tell that the song's production is starting with the keyboard recording. Single blocks of ringing accoustic piano chords at the beginning of measures as if the composer is imaging the rest of the parts as he/she is noodling on a piano. Not that great.However, not everything is black & white and this album does have a couple of decent tracks. ""Ocean Air"" is nice and catchy though you can see through it in a couple of listens.I usually eject this one after trying over and over to give it a chance."
3,"Ok fender, mounting system can fail.","When the fender was attached, it worked very well, however the mechanism to mount to the front fork failed on me. It's just an expanding wedge type mechanism to secure it to the fork, but it lost tension and eventually failed, which was unfortunate because until then, it was great."
1,topeak defender,"the product was poorly made, the front and back half of the fender broke off after 2 and 4 weeks of use respectively. the fender was being used for commuting to work (not even mountain biking or off road riding). as soon as it fell apart, i had to order a headland fender to replace the current one. caveat emptor!!"
2,Doesn't fit my Specialized Rockhopper,"Bought it for a 23"" frame 2007 Specialized Rockhopper. Unfortunately, the rubber insert that expands in the front fork stem to hold the fender on is too small for the hole in my bike's stem. I couldn't find any way to make this fender work and gave up on it. I gave it two stars because the construction seems OK, and it might be fine if it actually fits your bike."
4,"Good Fenders, easy install","Nothing but good things for the most part with the fender. Easy to install, mount is plastic BUT metal tab to reinforce it. They pop on and off with the push of a button clip which is great for me as I ride long distance on my bike on pavement, so I can remove them so I dont have the drag which I could be wrong about and get less drag when installed (havent tested yet)being maybe more drag created by top of forks being open.Only 4 stars BECAUSE of personal preference, the wider of the fenders goes in front, which I would prefer was the opposite so there was more coverage from the mud and junk being slung up on me. Havent tested actual performance yet but then againt never understood big front half of bike fenders anyways."
3,Its Okay...,Looks great but the mounting system is plastic and if u fall u can warp it. And if u have a higher end bike like me there is no bolting into my fork so I zipped tied it instead. Would prefer a metal setup if they made them. Overall it still gets the job done with a little tinkering over time.
1,Inadequate description of product,"Unless I am missing something, the method of attachment doesn't work with centerpull brakes, and the instructions on the packaging do not appear to illustrate alternative means of attachment."
4,Good fender good price,"I bought this fender recently and am very happy with it. It installed very easily, the instructions were a little lacking but if you have even very basic knowledge of your bike it is very easy, it takes only a few turns of an allen wrench to get it installed. I was worried that the clearances from the wheel and head tube would make it difficult to reinstall the wheel or not leave the front brake cables enough clearance to work properly but I was happy to find that it posed no problems at all. The fender looks very nice on the bike and serves its purpose very well. I love riding a muddy trail and no having debris flying up into my face anymore."
1,Stay away! Very fragile...,"Broke before I even got it on the bike. As I was putting it on, the flimsy plastic that connects the fender to the ""quick release"" snapped in my hand. Useless product."
2,80% pointless,"This Fender is WAY to short on a 17"" frame with 26"" wheels. 80% of the frame were it suppossed to stop the mud and bricks hitting fails badly. the rear part is abuot 5""+ to short to stop most of the mud.I got it to stop bricks damaging my Giant bike frame and failed....2 stars for build of it and the 20% of mud it actualy stops..DO NOT buy this is you plan it for the same reason i got it for..."
1,"Junk, waste of time and money!","Topeak make some of my favorite bike accessories.. Unfortunately, not this one! Installed it easily on my Rockshox fork, looked pretty cool.. Lasted about 30 seconds, until I hit the first small bumps.. Front 1/2 of fender mount snapped right off.. LOL, What a joke, the makers must be laughing about this one, Pathetic!Well, at this price, I can't complain too much.. But it is not worth the trouble of returning it!Everyone is an online sucker occasionally, live and learn! Make a note, don't waste money or time on this one.."
2,Bumps kill this fender.,"Remove this fender if mountain biking. I've been using it on moderate trails for a bit over a month, riding approx 75 trail miles. It had served well, until one chilly morning the other day the plastic mount snapped. The front portion flew off, though the rear section of the front fender remained and gave some protection. This fender would be best for wet asphalt only.Luckily, the two-piece fenders easily slide off mount using thumb tabs and without tools when trail riding. If riding a loop trail, you could hide the fenders in the brush and reattach for the trip back home, if you're not a backpackr.I gave the system two stars... On asphalt, I'd give it five stars. The flimsy mount needs to be all steel.Please, always use a taillight flasher and use a mirror. Them cagers are honey badgers! Steve F"
4,Defender,Great Item. aside from being a water and mud protector it makes the mountain bike look like a motorbike. i've done wheelies and jumpinng and it stays put. yet it is easy to take off.
4,Works as it should,"Mounted on a 2005 Specialized Pro Hardrock. It keeps water from spraying up into my face, but you still get spray that shoots out in front of you at a low angle. If you're riding fast enough, then this low angle spray will hit you just below chest-level.So, good enough, but if you want to be dry, then you should use full-fenders on a commuter bike.It looks cool."
2,not as durable as advertised...,This front fender worked well for a few days until the attachment mechanism thing snapped when I went over a medium sized rock.
2,Nope Nope Nope,"Once again proves you get what you pay for... rated two stars because it doesn't leak!Eggs stick badly... bacon even sticks... I bought two, so it's not a fluke. Handles were loose, but I tightened them with a screwdriver. Pans are handle heavy so they don't sit on the burner flatly. Nope, spend more and get what you want!"
5,A JOY,"Sonny Rollins continues to remind us that improvisation has so many different and equally pleasing approaches. This album is not simply a dense package of rapidly passing notes. It is truly the communication of the joy, humanity and spirit of a remarkable man. This album is one of Sonny's best recorded performances because it captures the spirit of Sonny's live performances. This is a man who still has incredible technique, but who chooses to hold it in reserve while he explores every possible variation and nuance of the meoldy and harmony of the songs he has chosen to perform. Never has the sax had a sound more like and as expressive as a human voice."
4,This Is What I Do,"This Is What I Do~ Sonny Rollins is a more great saxophone playing from the ""immortal"" Sonny Rollins. Listening to this album is soothing and it is like therapy for the soul. I am not going to say that I am a Jazz expert by any means. However, I do like good music and this certainly is it. Higly recommended indeed and it gets 4 well deserved stars."
2,Eh...,"Average account of WW2 espionage operations. It's obvious that the work is a first book from the author. Uneven research and focus hampers the study. There is also a sad lack of primary sources, however, this may be more from the fact that the documents are still for some reason classified by the CIA. However, if you are interested in a good account of OSS operations in the CBI Theater this is a decent source. If you want Europe, look somewhere else."
2,Not worth your money,"The back of this book gave me high expectations. It seemed that mystery, intrique, and some laughs were all rolled into one within. Well, they very well might be, but I wouldn't know since I couldn't finish the book. I rarely stop reading before the end (I even finished Military Blunders by Coffee). It reads more like a boring television script, than an interesting collection of tales and facts. Save your money and pass on this one."
4,A Memoir by a Lover of Shakespeare,"This is a sweet and poignant memoir of a man who loves Shakespeare and teaches Shakeseare to the elderly in New York. When he is not teaching, he spends his time dressing actors for the parts they will be playing in Shakespearian productions.He spends quite a bit of time reminiscing about the impact of his dysfunctional family and his relationship with his profoundly disabled sister.I highly recommend this book."
5,Beautiful Pass Through Another Life,"This memoir is incredibly heart felt, sensitive and beautiful. Interspersed with Shakespeare's words, and Smith's experiences sharing them with New York City's oldest people, as well as his experience with Shakespeare on stage is a pained and moving life.This is a remarkable book for anyone who identifies with the social/communal feel of life in the theatre, or artists for that matter. As well, anybody who knows the outside of an easy going life, alienation, deep guilt, a stilted family life, and the strain and sublime beauty of mental retardation.I feel thankful after reading this. Smith illuminates the simple beauty of a daily train ride into the city, the warmth and intensity of being an off stage dresser, the joy of being with young actors and artists, and the sweetness of giving to older folks, and finding out that they need vitality and art as much as anyone. Great for actors and theatre lovers!"
3,"Good book, but very little of it is new.","I'd like to keep this blunt. Basically, any long-time Greyhawker will find nearly nothing new in this booklet, as it simply offers up old-knowledge with a few new minor details thrown in, which are generally unneeded. Any new Greyhawker should get this book for its detailing of the Gods of Oerth and the various countries, especially if they do not possess the From the Ashes boxed set."
2,"Newbie's aside, this book is a fair waste of money","Unless you are totally new to the Greyhawk campaign world and/or are a RPGA member adventuring in a real Living Greyhawk setting, this book is a waste of money. I wish I had stuck with the simple DnD Greyhawk Gazeteer (the skinny one). This version essentially expands on the details presented in the skinny version, but much of the material is irrelevant to the current campaign setting. It's history, history,history, and there is little ""new"" about it. Again, if your new to DnD and have no experience with Greyhawk, buy it... otherwise it's a waste of cash."
5,The Good Ole Days,"Great CD, I love everything Gene Watson sings so I am partial to anything he sings. This is a must have CD. I especially like ""You Pushed Me To The Limit"", ""The Man That Broke Your Heart"" and ""I Don't Need A Thing At All"". but I listen to all of the songs."
4,Chamberlain take a turn,"This album is great.... However, if your'e looking for more split lip or fates got a driver type stuff, be aware. When I bought this album I was so shocked. The songs are mostly blues / country based and during my first listen I started to query whever the whole split lip / chamberlain thing was because they wanted to diversify in their musical style?. Most of my ""emo"" listening is to stuff by post hardcore bands and at a glance chamberlain fall right on the edge of this... this album though, is a real grower and after several times I find it one of the best pieces I have bought for some time, as if the strangeness of it compells you to listen again. On close inspection you can hear split lip in there...but chamberlain do not wear their hardcore hearts on their sleeves.. a great record given a chance."
4,DCD Lovers take note: A good Album,"Nice Vocals. A great etheral sound. Well written melodies - modern music with an almost classical/renissance influence. If you like Dead can Dance, you'll like this album"
5,WOW!,"This is one of the best book I have ever read. Walter Moers is so imaginitive. I could not put it down. This book is pretty much consists of the creativity and strangeness of George Lucas, a bit of J.R.R. Tolkien, a good amount of humor, and a whole bunch of WOW!"
4,The awesomeness of a little bluebear,"This is an amazing book, which thrills your imagination and brings your inner child forth from hiding. I read this book when I was young, and have always wanted to read it again, and even several years later, the book is still awesome. But reading it again made me aware of the quantity of information. It's like a sea of information which you might be drowning in if you're not careful. For a first-time reader, it's just fun, but as it was my second time, I noticed just how much description of just everything there were, and I caught myself skipping pages on pages, knowing I really wasn't missing out on Captain Blubears adventure.But it is an awesome and great book, and I know I will read it again, 'cause I worship the imagination of Walter Moers!"
4,very good!!!,I really wanted to give this book four and a half stars because it has a lot of action and a little funny too. the pictures were great. two thumbs up :)
4,And then it was simply grand!,"This is just a fun book, the endless ramble of a mysterious creature the Bluebear, who is exactly that: he's a bear, and he is blue. There's no overarching Grand Purpose, no metaphor/allegory beyond the extremely obvious, no lesson to be learned, just a good read. Yes, it gets overdone and overwrought, with the sugar desert, the grim ship the Moloch, the mad chase of the Spiderwitch, but our hero caroms from adventure to adventure like a pinball. The book does suffer from what's been called the ""And Plot"": and then this happened, and then that happened, and then... But it's a grand, wild journey; the kind kids tend to love and even grown-ups will find themselves peeking at when they think no-one's looking. A book for lifting up world-weary spirits."
4,Lovely & imaginative,"Sweet, fun to read. A delight to follow Bluebear on his adventures. Probably a great book to read to kids, but relaxing and funny for adults. Wonderful cartoons."
3,OK but where is the plot?,"A series of life stages told in vignette form does not a novel make. Populating a world with strange quirky creature is fine but they just populate it, they don't seem to live in it. An amusing read, but hardly gripping. And the Encyclopedia entries are a tad too close to The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy entries in the Hitchhiker novels."
3,Silly,"This book is silly. I don't know of any other way to put it.First, it's immense. The words contained with in it's 703 pages are at best, clever, at worst unimaginative and frustrating to read.The author creates a world - partially consisted of Earth and partially consisting of words and places with slightly changed names from Earth that can be despicably difficult to pronounce and remember. Simply put: Extremely distracting.The stories are cute and sometimes subtly educational/moral...but with the various tangents the author goes on - from the eyes of the Bluebear - rarely fit together enough to create a story that inspires imagery and a world that I can sink myself into.I'm reading this book with two other people and so far, we all just want to make it all the way through. I may update this review later if the book gets better, but we're over half way and I'm still thoroughly unimpressed."
4,Pretty Good,The book got here quickly with plenty of time before Christmas. The cover had a bit of damage to it which made me a little upset but the pages of the book are in great condition. Overall I was pretty pleased with my purchase.
3,compare it to Harry Potter?,"ok, i will.Harry Potter and this book are in the SAME mold.if you have found the strength within you to accept the idiocy of ALL the adults in the Harry Potter series, and even delight in the random supid behavior of the Harry Potter children, or the occasional unexplained plot twist, or J.K. Rowling's avoidance of any simple solution, ever...THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!if, however, you expect more from your adult literature, perhaps you should read something with a bit of depth?"
2,A bit overdone,"Unfortunately, this book really didn't impress me all that much. There is only one character, and his (its?) development is shallow. There is a tendency that I didn't like in Rabelais, either, of making a point by giving a catalog; as soon as a new plot twist is introduced, there is a tedious catalog of all the variations on the twist that's supposed to be funny, but ends up being quite boring.I suppose it would be a fun book for someone looking for mindless humor, but I was quite disappointed in it, and wish I hadn't purchased it."
5,She Likes It!,"I bought this for my wife. She says it is ""well written and very enjoyable."" From her that is high praise. My wife usually gets her books from the library. After reading another work by the author, she asked me to buy this one for her. High praise indeed!"
5,Veeeeeery good book,"I loved 13 1/2 lives of Captain Bluebear. It was a great book about a Bluebear. Bluebears have 27 lives. so the author writes about 13 1/2 of them. I'll admit that the book becomes boring at points. Like when he described all of the buildings in Atlantis. But otherwise it was a good book. I loved reading about his lives with the minipirates, on gourmetica island, in the gloomberg mountains with the professor, and with the Reptillian Rescuer. I would reccomend this book to anyone between the ages of 9-12. this book is a great read"
5,THIS ISN'T A CHILDREN'S BOOK.,"I kind of resent the fact people keep calling it that. It's basically a book in the style of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide..."" so I guess if that's a children's book....It's basically a journey story. It's wonderfully entertaining and very fast. It's basically a book for adults with a childlike imagination. It's fun and engaging. When's the last time you picked up a adult lit book with illustrations? It's just fun.I highly recommend it."
4,What fun!,I have just finished the 13 1/2 lives of Captain Bluebear. What a delight. I thoroughly enjoyed Moers vocabulary and imagination. How fabulous to find an amusing and captivating book that is not for the feeble brained. We are in the middle of construction on our home and this was the perfect diversion for those stressful times. Highly recommended.
5,"To me, Moers is a genius.","When you read his books, you will discover new worlds. He can be funny, romantic, scary, fantastic, angry... You just have to try Moers, I think, you will love him. And Captain Blue Bear is only the beginning...P.S.: I would have given more stars, if possible."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this product because I had a poor mattress and experienced back problems. I had seen the infomercial on TV and read reviews about people who said they slept so much better and experienced fewer back problems than before.First of all, every time I would sit on one corner of the bed, the rest of the mattress topper would flop up. For some reason I expected it to stay flat, even though it is an air mattress. My mistake. Then it would always move around while I was sleeping. I would wake up and the mattress topper and I would be hanging halfway off the bed. It just would not stay under the fitted sheet. After all that trouble, I still experienced many of the back problems I had before.To its credit, this product did help a little bit, but not much. I bought it to save money and sleep better, but I finally had to break down and buy a brand new mattress anyway. Learn from my mistake; save yourself the time and the money."
4,Aerobed Twin Mattress Topper,I had a bad back and wondered why every time I went camping and slept on my air mattress my back wouldn't hurt! So I bought this mattress topper and it solved all my problems; it was like camping!. You can adjust the firmness up and down. You can use regular twin sheets on it and tuck them under or purchase the sheets made for it. I have no problems with it moving around on top of my other mattress or popping up.
4,Ditto - almost perfect,"Very solid construction and easy to install. As reviewed by Linda, sandwich-, quart-,and gallon-size bags will not fit. I have an alternative available to me for those items so it isn't an issue for me. I'm very happy with my purchase."
2,poor shipping,The wrap rack was shipped in a post office mailing bag. It was bent out of shape when I received it. It should have been shipped in a box for more protection.
4,Great Product! Poor Shipping Method.,"This product was easy to install. It doesn't hold all the things I'd like it to, but I'm getting good use out of it. I was very concerned when the rack arrived. It was sent US mail, in nothing but a layer of bubble warp and a flimsy bag. The metal was bent, I assume as a result of being tossed around during shipping. I was able to bend the metal back into place, and there were not problems with installing the wrack. But it should have been packed in a box for shipping."
5,"Wanda, a married mother of an 18 month old","After reading the different stories in ""Where are our Fathers?""; I now have a clearer understanding of the different obstacles that single moms have to overcome. This book gives a sense of hope; a light at the end of the tunnel. I know that women tend to get very weary but don't give up the fight continue through all of your struggles because JOY comes in the morning."
3,A nice date,"This 1968 date finds Sonny Criss tackling a kenspeckle batch of material that includes everything from ""Yesterdays"" to ""Ode to Billie Joe"" & ""The Beat Goes On"". The title-track is the standout, with a relaxed, spacious groove that rolls on for seven minutes without a hitch--great stuff. The band's a good one, with Cedar Walton, Bob Cranshaw & the great Alan Dawson performing smoothly & in complete sympathy with the leader. The album's let down a bit by the unsubtle studio sound, which makes Walton's piano sound rather harsh & clunky, but it's not bad, & anyone who's interested in Criss will find this a worthwhile purchase. Like most Prestige albums it's short measure at 33 minutes--caveat emptor--but it's a good album nonetheless."
5,Sonny Criss The Beat Goes On,This CD is exceptional clear music even though it was recorded and remastered songs are banging mellow and some hot bebop songs would recommed this.
5,Quick Read,This textbook is unlike any other i've been assigned in my classes before. The textbook is organized into many short chapters that are specific and straight forward. This text is absent of flowery time-wasting information that you know the professor is not going to test on. All text books should be written like this.
4,Pleasantly surprised,The outside cover gives a false impression of the information it conceals. The material is interesting and well presented in an organized fashion that makes it easy to follow. A PhD is not required to understand the material presented but prior knowledge of basic concepts is helpful.
5,Works for me,Soldering... Spray Paint... Leaded Gas... Plastic/Rubber melting fumes.... it all stays out of my lungs now :)Remember to still use in a well ventilated area. Because your cutting your O2 down.
4,Pretty good,"It's a little small for me. I'm 20 years old 5'11, But it's still worth it! It works fine and is still air tight all around works perfectly"
5,State Houses: America's 50 State Capitol Buildings,"State Houses: America's 50 State Capitol Buildingsbeautiful pictures, everything I was looking,for, lots of informationThe best book ever!"
4,Great book.....,"I really enjoyed this book very much. The detail and amazing pictures are what truly captivated me. The only complaint I have is that this book didn't have pictures of the House and Senate chambers of the Hawaii Capitol building. Being from Hawaii, I would have liked to have seen pictures of inside the chambers because they are AMAZING and like no other in the country. Other than that......2 thumbs ALL THE WAY UP for this book."
4,State Houses,I have visited many state houses across our great nation and this book is a beautifully pictured and written but it also makes a great coffee table topper. I have enjoyed it again and again and visitors cant keep there hands of it.
4,State Capitols,"We love the book, but wish it was either in chronological order of entering into statehood, or alphabetical order. The pictures are beautiful and the information is written very well."
2,Just OK,Found this product a little more complicated in format than I'd hoped. Don't like some of the features. I wanted simple calerie counter. This has a few too many required steps.
2,"Good, but not Great","I am kicking myself for paying over $75 for this cheap tool! To the company's credit, delivery was fast and the product does what it says, it counts calories. But that is ALL that it does. There no balance of telling you how much you should be eating to meet your health goals minus how much you've already eaten that week/day. if i had to do over again, I'd go for a different product."
5,Keep on Track,"I have many health issues and need to watch my food intake. I used to use paper and notepad but this gadget is a life saver. Not only does it track EVERYTHING, at the end of the day or week or month you can generate a report. It certainly is an eye opener when you THINK you are eating healthy and you find you are far short on fiber or too high on sodium or too little on protein. Truly helps you tweak your intake for optimal benefits. Being mindful also helps you to make better choices and a side effect is less weight gain, or even a more consistent loss as you can program it for YOUR goals!!! GREAT telephone support too! Handy, light weight, helpful item."
4,Helpful Diet Tool,"I really like this calorie counter! You can carry it with you and just plug things in as you eat, so you don't have to try to remember at the end of the day. It has lots of foods, generic and brand name. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it's a little hard to see without my bifocals. But it's doing the job - I would buy it again. I highly recommend it."
4,freda\s review of calorysmart,"when inputting items care must be taken to observe which mealthe item belongs ie breakfast, lunch dinner etc. if you makea wrong meal it can be corrected later. It would be nice tosee a ""sugar"" input for diabetics info. the software isgood. cannot correct input when it is loaded into pc."
3,could be smarter,"I like the features of this device, its ability to store and do reports. That said, I found it tedious to enter the actual data. I stopped using it after a couple of weeks because I just got tired of having to look up so many food items after each meal. I found its ability to store favorites to be a big time saver, but its lookups were pretty weak. There needs to be a ""relevance"" sort. Anyway, this gave me an accurate way to track daily intake and exercise, but it takes some time. I'm glad I purchased this device, and I hope they keep improving it."
3,Good product but cumbersome to use.,"This is a wonderful product and it does everything that they claim it does. But, for me, I ended up having to manually enter a lot of the foods I was eating because the items they had in their data base didn't agree with the caloric value of what I was eating or I couldn't find it in the database at all. In the end, it ended up being too cumbersome for me to use. It was quicker to keep a written food diary and look up calories in a resource book."
5,Great item,"I like this thing a lot. I use it only to track food, not exercise. Nonetheless, I find very useful. It is easy to use, easy to enter or delete entries, to add favorite foods, etc. Sometimes it freezes up, and I need to take out the batteries for it to function again. Apart from this, I like it and really recommned it."
4,Almost perfect,"It does everything I need it to do and it is very easy to use. I wish it was easier to hold in one hand or to lay flat on a table (the back is not flat, so when you press the number or arrow keys, it tilts to one side). Otherwise, I really like it - great way to keep track of calories and exercise, even when traveling. The large number of restaurant dishes that are listed is very useful!"
4,Pretty Good!,Nice to be able to carry with me when I don't have my computer handy to keep me honest!
2,Coheso Calorie Smart,Great concept but very bad to screen which makes it hard to see. Also the logging food items is difficult because you have to know where the item is and a lot of name brand and restaurants aren't loaded so you will have to make subsitutions with the item closet to what you ate.
1,Rip Off,It was the worst item I have purchased for a long time. You can hardly read the numbers and it doesn't list much. I sent it back after opening it. DON'T waste your time or money buying it...
3,Calorie smart,The display screen is to light with makes it hard to read. In order for me to enter my items I have to shine a booklight on the display screen.
1,Soundboards Would Have Been Nice!,"Save for the BBC tracks of disc 1, Epitaph is unlistenable strictly because of genuinely awful sound! I own decade-old cassettes of audience recordings that contain far superior sound & dynamic range. It's understandable to counter bootlegs, but it's sad when the bulk of these disks barely reach bootleg quality!Robert Fripp should take a hint from the Grateful Dead in releasing unreleased material. Almost every mail-order Dead release (Dick's Picks, etc.) is marked by respectible to great sound quality, with the source being the master tapes. As for discs 3 & 4 of Epitaph, while they cost only $13, the sound there is even worse to the point that the price winds up a poor value."
5,THE TRUE WORD OF GOD read the bible and see yourself,"THIS VIDEOS CONTAINS ACCURATE PORTRAYALS AND IS A MUST SEE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN. IT IS THE WORD OF GOD TOLD FROM THE VERY BEGINNING UP UNTIL NOW. AFTER YOU REVIEW THIS VIDEO YOU WILL NOT BE DECEIVED BY AGGRESSIVE WORLD MEDIA. OBJECTIVE, UNBIASED, AND IMPARTIAL...ANYONE AND I DO MEAN ANYONE WITH A RATIONAL THINKING PATTERN WILL BE ABLE TO DISCERN THE TRUTH FOR THEMSELVES! DO NOT BE FOOLED! DAVE HUNT EXPLAINS THE TRUTH BEHIND THE REAL INTENTION OF ISLAM, THE ROLE OF ANTI-SEMITISM, AND THE DEEDS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST COMPLETE VIDEO EVER MADE ABOUT RELIGION IN GENERAL. THE TIME IS COMING AND LET THE TRUTH BE TOLD!"
3,Not quite as nice as expected...,"I purchased this for my wife. She had purchased a peridot version of this ring in Santa Barbara on a weekend getaway with her aunt and LOVES IT! When she found this one in red online, she was very excited and asked for it for her birthday. When it arrived, she was disappointed. Even though it costs about the same as the one she purchased in Santa Barbara and the picture is practically identical (just a different color CZ), it looks a lot cheaper in person. Our daughter says it looks like something you'd get from a machine. The sizing runs big, too, so it slides around on her biggest finger."
3,The 1st season was much better.,It's not that the season is bad. It's more that it's not really good. 1st season i was rolling on the floor. This one is less impressive. I was able to hook a few ppl who never saw/ heard of Harvey Birdman. I cant let them see this season. I'm waiting for season 3 now. Hope it's better. :)
1,Defective?,"I love Harvey Birdman, and I'm sure I would have loved the second season, but I ordered it twice and both times I ended up with two copies of the second disc. I suspect it was some kind of error that didn't get corrected. I wasn't willing to order a third time. I don't blame Amazon or whoever sent it. That's just what happened."
1,Don't Buy This Phone,"About 5 months after I bought this phone, I couldn't hear anything that was being said to me unless my phone was on speaker. This can only be done after a call is answered. So I called t-mobile, and they replaced the phone with a new v300. Another 4 months later, and I have the same exact problem. Only this time, if I want the phone replaced, I have to pay for it.Now imagine having to conduct all of your phone calls on speakerphone, no matter who you're with.Seriously, don't buy this phone."
5,da phone to have,"I have used nokia, samsung, ericcson and i think this one is the next BEST for a while. I like the ringtones (downloadable) (3gupload.com is a good free site) loud and clear, speakerphone is convenient, and the small phone size is good too. the camera is good for a phone, maybe nite pics are not as clear, but in good light u r getting some very good 640X480 pics. you can email multiple pics in 1 email, thats convenient.color screen is sharp, much better than the T610 (which i have used) good in sunlight too. there are a few recommendations that i would like to see improved upon down the lane in future models. speakerphone without opening or without waiting until i hear the other person on the line.for all u foreign travellers or ovrseas people, this phone comes with a plug adapter for asia and europe also. also comes with a nice matching color belt clip.Overall, I give this phone 4.5 stars, based on my experience."
4,"Nice, fair priced phone",I work for t-mobile and hand over fist these are one of the coolest camera phones out no doubt. I also am getting a e715 but these due have a good battery life and awesome reception. Although i love the e715 by samsung better if u dont have alot of $$$ to spend and want a camera phone dont hesitate these phones are a rarity.
2,what about the battery life? Please respond!,"Hi, I just got the v300 phone, and the battery life seems RIDICULOUSLY AWFUL!! I charged the phone all night, and at 11am this morning, my battery was low! How is that possible? I used it for maybe 15 min or less in the morning!?! I am thinking about returning this phone and getting the Ericson phone instead-please offer insight to this situation!! Also, last night, every time I tried to make a call on the first try it said network busy- call failed- something of that sort- I had to call every person aobut 3 times before I got through! I am looking for some answers! Would GREATLY be appreciated!"
5,this phone will never be available from this site,"I emailed Amazon to ask about the ETA of the V300; this is what they told me:Thank you for writing to Amazon.com.I am sorry for any misunderstanding regarding the availability of theMotorola V300 Phone on our web site.Unfortunately, the Motorola V300 Phone is out-of-stock and we do notexpect to receive any more from our supplier. For this reason, thephone can not be added to your Shopping Cart.I hope that this information is helpful. If you have any furtherquestions, please refer to our Help section:http://www.amazon.com/help/Thanks for shopping at Amazon.com.Sorry Folks, I wanted one too. Try elsewhere, and good luck."
2,Waste,"ok when i first got dis fone i liked it ALL RIGHT pic quality n speakerfone wuz loud,but around 6 monthz lata da problemz began , bat life , speakerfone, and worst of all could barely make callz , cuz i cudnt hear the person in the earpiece so i wus force 2 use da speakerfone, for da remainder of mah contract,,dont get it man,Seriously MOTO screwed up heayea i dropped it a few timez but hey,"
2,MOTOv300,"OK moto 300 not a bad phone, most problems with the phone is mostly with user error and abuse...v330 is better v360 is coming!"
1,Never buy Motorola Phone with a tiny charger,"I have two V300 phone, it was working properly until one day i am starting have charging problem. The screen shows: ""Unable to charge""... I was able to correct it by replug it for several times.. and finally the phone goes dead. I aways get the error charging messgae... The good thing is the 1 year warrenty coverd this but it's already the 3rd time i have to request a replace phone sent to me!! The worse thing is , TMOBILE now even start to charge $10 shipping fee for the problem they generated.I will never buy the MOTOROLA phone with the same charger again.Stupid design that never consider durability."
3,My V300 was also defective,"I bought 2 of these phones, one for me and one for my wife. Her's was fine. Mine would reboot about 1/2 the time when I tried to answer an incoming call. I took it in for service. After three weeks it was fixed, and I am satisfied with it."
1,A very HOT phone from Motorola,I am on a 2nd replacement phone in less than 30 days .The first had a keypad problem. The 6 key would not get pressed at the first attempt.Had to be pressed at different angle to get it right.The second phone used to get Heated up like anything while charging. Further it used to drain any fully charged battery.in minutes and heat up completely. Really HOT !Should I say a pretty HOT phone from Motorola !!!Please dont buy this phone.The Odds of you getting a defective V300 are pretty much high.RgdsV300ictim
4,Freakin' sweet phone...but not perfect,"I must admit that I'm rather happy with the performance of my phone. Most complaints that I would have are in the realm of T-Mobile's service, not the phone. It's got a great setup, good options and good funcitonality for the most part. The keys have been the only thing to really bother me on any level. Sometimes, you can punch buttons on the side while its in your pocket and change the ringer style. Sometimes, the upper navigational keys have also acted a little squirrelly. On the whole though, it's been a great little phone."
1,Battery is very bad..,"My battery discharges in under a day with less than 30 mins of talking. I changed 2 batteries, but still the same problem."
3,Screen is blank thro polarized glasses,"If you view the v300 screen thro polarized sun glasses, the screen looks blank. It looks as if the phone were switched off."
5,Good phone,"This phone lasted a long time. I think I dropped it 100 times and it still kept going. After 3 years, the volume in the ear went bad."
4,Very good,Does everything a phone is supposed to do ... and is small and handy. Camera is alright ... no blue tooth functionality available so its a drawback. But over all a very sturdy unit and gave no trouble watsoever.
1,"Dropped calls, T-Mobile no help","I have had this phone for 2 years or so... Very soon after I bought it, it started dropping calls. I could be in an area with good reception and yet during the middle of a conversation I would notice that the other person had stopped talking. ""Hello? Hello?"" They could still hear me, but I could not hear them. This problem has persisted and despite three calls to T-Mobile threatening to switch to another carrier I haven't been offered any incentive to stay. I am currently scoping out the deals to switch to another carrier."
3,"Cute phone, great size, but paint chips.","I like this phone very much. It's size and weight are great for a cameraphone. My only complaint is that within a week of receiving it, with very little use, the silver paint on the sides of the phone began to chip off of the plastic surfaces of the phone."
2,One Bad Bug I Encountered,"I got this phone after having a Nokia 3595 and a Motorola V66, and overall I like the V300 much more. Except there is one problem that has plagued me since the day I got my phone. There is a bug where when you open the flip screen the screen and background will short out, so you have to close the phone and re-open it multiple times. Which in many cases has made me drop phone calls. The phones features are great, and when the screen is working I have only had fun with it. If anyone knows how I can fix this without contacting t-mobile or motorola and waiting weeks for a new phone please e-mail me."
5,SuPeR PhOnE,"i love this phone it has great futres an excellent camera,great text messageing EVREYTHING!!!! it has a good digital clock itsa great phone get it MAN!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Poor picture quality.....speakerphone issue,"I bought this phone in January when I was trying to find a quality picture phone for my job. From the many online reviews I had read, the V300 seemed to fit the bill. Well, I would not recommend buying this phone for its picture taking capability, as I find it to be well below average. I did not realize just how poor the picture quality was until my brother-in-law visited and we compared phones. He has a Samsung VGA1000 picture phone with Sprint PCS. The picture quality difference in these two phones is like night and day. The Samsung phone pictures are much sharper and have better color than the V300. I also find the speakerphone function of the V300 frustrating, as you cannot activate it until a few seconds after the other party answers, not when it starts ringing. If you are looking to buy this phone for picture quality, I would suggest looking elsewhere."

5,Awesome Phone,"I've had this for a few weeks now, and it's awesome. I was deciding between the v300 or the SE T610. It was basically bluetooth vs. flip phone. I picked the v300 and my friend picked the t610. And we both agreed that if the v300 had bluetooth, it would've been perfect. As it is, the screen seems more vibrant than the 610. It also seems to have more battery life. I went with the flip phone because I didn't feel like shelling out the extra bucks for a bluetooth headset. Overall, this phone hasn't dissappointed me."
5,top 1 seller says everything,"I bought one a month ago, attracted by its style. Now I got a second one for my wife! Well, had I ordered earlier, I could get $50 more discount from T-mobil :) Phone is excellent, just wonder why it took so long for motorola to deliver this product! One tip I found: better fully use up the battery then recharge it the first few times, then you get a longer standby time :)"
1,Don't take T-Mobile,I rarely say anything is bad but trust me on this one I live in Atlanta and T-mobile service is very-very Bad here. It is not me but atleast seven of my close friends experience. You will not get signal if you get signal you will get Network busy. I have no complain about v300 phone. It is excellent but good phone can't help you if service provider (T-mobile) is so bad. My friends have different phone but all of us face same problemNo signal or Network busy. T-mobile is very bad
1,Worst phone I ever bought.,"I bought this phone and right from the second day I had problems with charging. I had to struggle to fit the charger so that it starts charging. Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem. It also had a new problem. Suddenly it stops ringing. I will be getting calls but no ring and no sound from the phone. I would give negative stars if possible but this is a horrible model."
1,Very bad service coverage in Bay Area,My phone gets awful signals in both my workplace and home which makes T-Mobile service pretty much useless to me. Contacted Customer Service and they said that nothing could be done. So I am supposed to keep paying for service that I cannot use most of the time because I signed a 1 year service agreement with them.
1,Still Waiting,"I ordered the V300 with service on February 6 thinking it would come before March 31 so I could get my $200 mail in rebate. Unfortunatly it STILL has not come (March 16). The cell phone I've heard is great and I expect it would be a lot better if I actually had it. I've called amazon and they are no help at all. Also I had to get their number from Tmobile because they don't state their number on their website. My cell phone has not even been shipped yet, and they moved the shipping date to march 25-april 4 when it was originally march 9-march 23. I'm thinking about just going to a Tmobile store nearby and ordering it. Just be aware that this could happen to you too."
2,Seemed to go well then all went down hill.,"It arrived very quickly. Unlike some customers, I was able to switch my number very easily. Customer service from T-mobile was very friendly. I had Cingular's Nokia and I only switched because I wanted to get a better deal, especially make international calls if I had to and roam when I travelled abroad (Cingular had limited options) However, T-mobile may offer more roaming/connectivity in more countries but they forgot to mention the fact they offer poor connectivity in the middle of Chicago! I was able to talk in the elevator with my Cingular service. I can barely talk in front of a window. A fireworks display at Navy Pier will interrupt a signal when I'm on Michigan Avenue -- visible distance but not that close."
1,Disappointed and problem with rebate,"I was very excited to get this phone based on the reviews. It has all the great features that everyone mentions, but the reception was horrible. I had switched from Sprint and now switched to Verizon, and both have much better service.Phone does not come with a built-in flash as description above says. ......"
1,Do not buy this phone!,"I bought this phone about 15 days ago. Since then, it has dropped every single call I have made/received. In addition, when I try to call the person back, I hear nothing but loud static until the 3rd or 4th try. Also, when I hit the menu button (either the middle button in the directional arrows or the three bars), and go into an option (whether the phone book, settings, etc.), when I use one of the arrow keys, the entire screen goes blank and blinks a couple of times. Then when I go in again, it does it again! Do not buy this phone! I switched to TMobile from Sprint. I feel that TMobile has better service, but Sprint has better phones."
2,High Priced Phone with Low Performance,"I fell in love with this phone because of it's striking blue color and great features. I was so excited about having speakerphone, but whenever i didn't use the speakerphone I couldn't hear the person on the other end and it became very aggravating. It takes forever to answer the phone, almost 5 seconds. (By the time you answer the phone, the person on the other end is gone.) Camera is not that great!!"
4,Pros and Cons about the Motorola V300,"Pros:1. The phone has an integrated camera2. Loud speakerphone3. Great backlight4. Great display options5. Great ringtone options (MP3) equipped6. Rubber-ized exterior for good grip7. Comfortable talk mode8. Doesnt become hot after talking long (unlike certain Nokias)9. Great fliptop with external caller ID and clock display which lets you see a number before having to open the phone10. Amazon customer serviceCons:1. Battery life, in the beginning is bad, but over time becomes better2. I havent had any trouble with software crashes3. Software is difficult to maneuver and certain things take too many steps4. Menu is confusing5. Camera is reasonable quality (VGA)"
4,BEST FOR THE BUCK,"CAN NOT GIVE A 5 STAR BECAUSE THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR INPROVEMENT. MY DAUGHTER GOT THIS MOTOROLA FOR [$] BUT IT'S LCD WAS DEFECTIVE SO SHE GOT THE SAMSUNG E715 AS A REPLACEMENT. NOW THREE WEEKS LATER THE PRICE ON THIS MOTOROLA DROPS TO MINUS [$]WITH REBATES SO I DECIDED TO TRY IT AGAIN AS MY PHONE. SO FAR, SO GOOD. MOTOROLA VS SAMSUNG- THE V300'S BATTERY LAST LONGER,HAS A SPEAKERPHONE, VOICE RECOGNITION, A GREAT EXTERIOR FEEL, NICER ACCESSORIES, CHEAPER THAN FREE AND ITS AN AMERICAN COMPANY. THE E715 IS SMALLER, NO ANTENNA STICKING UP, BETTER LCD ACTION, LARGE OUTSIDE LCD WITH COOL CLOCK, LARGER PHONE # READOUT (WEAR OR NEED GLASSES?)AND MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS THAT BLINK WHEN YOU GET A PHONE CALL. (MY DAUGHTER LIKES THIS BUT I FEEL ITS A BIT TACKY). TRUTHFULLY, THE PRICE WAS THE DECISION MAKER BECAUSE BOTH PHONES ARE PRETTY COOL. THE YOUNGER YOU ARE, OR FEEL, THE MORE LIKELY YOU WOULD GO WITH THE SAMSUNG AND NOT THE MONEY SAVINGS!"
3,"An ""okay"" phone","It's definitely small, light weight and loaded with useful features (camera, alarm, mini organizer). The design is also pretty and the phone feels smooth in your hands... but the phone kept dying on me. i had to return it twice during my one year warranty. once the backlight stopped working and i couldn't see anything. on the second phone the camera stopped working. finally my third phone works fine, but after two years the speaker started deteriorating and i can't hear anything on the other end unless i put it on speaker or use the earphone. it was also pretty slow when browsing through pictures and occasionally freezes up."
2,Its a Phone - Not a PDA,"After two years, my phone is functioning fine. I like having speaker phone capability, but it is marginal because of limited volume control. The flip to answer mechanism is a bit clunky because of the potential for inadvertent half flips that hang up on the caller. The syncronozation software SUCKS. I'm using a very ordinary Outlook Windows Intel system, and getting the systems to interface properly is a nightmare. It worked fine for a while, but when I hit 250 contacts, the phone froze up on loads. Now all the meetings I had for that fateful week six months ago buzz me every single day. They can't be deleted nor can new ones be added."
3,"Awsome Phone, Broken Speaker","I loved this phone when i first got it, but after about 2 years the speaker stopped working so all my conversations had to be on speakerphone, which is not private. I called T-Mobile and they told that they would fix it for me no problem and then they tell me that since my warrantee was up i would have had to pay $150 to get it fixed, so i bought a samsung e315 (dont reccomend that either).Pros:amazing camera qualityafter 100 pics only 50% memory usedspeakerphonespeaker quality good (before it broke)gamesaimeasy to usegood battery liferingtones are coolringtone quality amazingcool buttonsvibrant screenCons:no exterior color screenbuttons on side push in pocketcasing (rubber) peels easilyscratches easilyhad trouble charging (wouldnt find the charger)bigheavykeypad scratched a circle into the main displayi really did like this phone though i miss it but dont want to get a new one cuz ill prob go through the speaker thing again"
2,T-Mobile knows its bad,"I just wanted to echo the other comments that match up with my experience. In addition to mine and my brother's, I have about 5 friends with this phone, and 3 of them have already had to get a new Nokia. This phone has issues connecting to the charger, issues with the earpiece degrading, and issues with horribly slow button-response times, not to mention randomly dropped calls. I called T-Mo and they said these were all known problems! But my phone is 1 yr 3 months old, so they won't replace it! Don't bother with this phone."
1,The worst phone I've ever had,"The Motorola V300 is the worst cellular phone I've had, and I've had quite a few. The phone will drop a call and then start ringing without there being an incoming call. It doesn't charge worth a dang and this is my third phone since purchasing it in April of 2004. I've only had this last one for a week and it's doing exactly the same thing! The other day it took me 30 minutes just to get the phone to turn back on. The dropped calls are ridiculous. I finally lost it with T-Mobile and insisted that they give me another model. Hopefully I'll have more success with this one. Motorola dropped the ball on this phone and this experience has given me a very negative opinion of Motorola. I will never buy another phone made by Motorola."
4,Great price........ great phone,"Pros: I've been using this phone since a while now and the phone works great with T-mobile service. The screen is large and the buttons are easy to press. The structure is sturdy and survived a drop. The camera is fair enough to get distant pictures in sunlight. -$100 is surely a great price for this phone.Below are cons but none are outsized and shouldn't stop you to buy this phone.Cons: The speakerphone is not that clear to listen. The ring tones are really really loud and could be annoying sometimes. If phone numbers are stored on phone and then copied to SIM...the phone book shows all entries twice, which is really annoying. The phone doesn't come with any belt clip or a case."
3,great until last week,"The phone was great every bit as I was a new cell phone user 3 months ago. Last week, my 4 year old was playing with it and now the camera doesn't work. Whenever I go to the camera mode, it says ""Busy. Try Again."" Well it is still a great phone without a camera."
5,Great Phone for Anyone,"I've had this phone for a month or so now, and have no complaints. It seems durable,has all the bells and whistles you could want, battery life is decent, sound quality is very good on T-Mobile, is intuitive to navigate, and has a nice solid feel. You can find deals to get the phone at no up front cost with service so if you're in the market for a versatile high quality picture phone this is it!"
4,Great phone with a small bug!!!,I happen to own this phone since its launch back in Nov2003.. Its an excellent piece with all necessary functions and cool looks!! The reception is also good with T-Mobile service. No IR/Bluetooth is compromise. Apart from all the goodness the phone does have a small bug - It rings once after a successful call and sometimes leaves a missed call message. I have seen this problem in more phones than mine.. so just be aware of this!! I would still rate this phone as A+ and would highly recommend it!!
2,reboots when trying to answer calls,"Ive had the phone for almost a year. the interface is bloated, settings are not easily found, there are just too many places for things to hide.the camera is passable in daylight. the phone was working OK, but lately it has a tendancy to reboot at inopportune times. such as when typing a text message, or when flipping open to answer a call.in addition, lately i cannot hear very well from the earpiece. i used to have to turn some people down when talking to them, but now sometimes i can barely hear at all.i will not be buying a motorola phone again in the near future."
2,Short-circuited after three months,"I like the phone, but inexplicably the ""end"" button stopped working, and a few hours later, the whole phone stopped working altogether. I did absolutely nothing wrong. Maybe I just had a lemon? We'll see. They're sending me another one, but if they charge me, and they don't honor their warranty, I will certainly write another angrier review."
3,Ruined Opportunity,"A simple phone call is not simple any more. This phone makes me appreciate what a thing of beauty and wonder my ""stone age"" S-105 is. No camera, no voice dialing, but easy to use, and very intuitive. Which brings me to what I hate most about this phone - the nonintuitive menus. You have to consult the manual for every little thing because the menu tree is hard to comprehend and harder still to penetrate. This is not a phone for the casual user.The pros: bright, easy to read display, attractive styling.Cons: Not a good phone, battery life is very short (2 - 3 hours of use.) Stay away if you can."
1,garbag phone,"this phone is easy to work but the speaker phone is like a kids toy. i have the e715 this is a much better and cleaner phone but it doesnthave speaker phone, the picture qualit on the e715 bows the v300 away. the v300 is very fragle i droped it and the front screen cracked, in a scooba cover.i droped the samsung e715 about 10 times it still works real good and picture qualit is very cler but the v300 zooms in better but very grainy. over all the e715 is amuch better phone but i am getting the nokia,video phone next."
2,Phone quality poor,"The bells and whistles are impressive but the one thing you need this phone for-talking-is poor. There is an echo to almost every call. I frequently get static on my end that causes me to have to have the caller repeat themselves. I went from a very old flip phone with great phone quality to a high priced ""gadget"". Unfortunately I don't feel it is worth the price tag and plan to send it back. If you want to purchase a cellphone then test the brands out first. Online ordering is great but buyer beware!"
3,good,ring volume does not go loud enough. vibrate is weak.good display on outside and when opened. small. didn't break when dropped--so far. good battery. camera quality good. displayes number on outside of phone when calling. silent on phone option is good.
1,Getting rid of this phone right now,"I have had Motorola V300 for three months now and recently bought a Siemens SL55 to replace it. V300 looks nice and has numerous features, but the main use of the cell phone should be, well, to talk to others, right? This is virtually impossible with V300 because it drops every single call after 12-13 minutes. If you continue calling back and talking to someone, the call drop time reduces to 10, then nine minutes. It's extremely annoying and I find it impossible to have a business-related conversation (sure, my brother understands that the conversation is going to cut off and I'll call him back when it does, but it doesn't seem very professional to start a conversation with a client with ""My phone cuts off, so when that happens, please be patient, I'll call you back. Or to try to hurry and finish your conversation before the time your V300 gave you runs out)."
1,Avoid it!!,I have motorolla v300 with T-mobile 1yr plan since march04.It worked good for first 2 monts. After that it started to drop calls after 8 to 10 mins. irrespective of whether the phone is fully charged/not or the signal is very good/bad.I asked for a replacement phone and the replaced phone is doing the same thing after only couple of weeks of good performance.The same problem was faced by two of my friends who have v300 + t-mobile combination.
1,I do not like this phone at all,"beginning to experience frequent drop calls after 3-4 months of using it. battery was never charged up properly, for some reason, the charging went out by itself occasionally. hard to use, not user friendly. but i have to give credit to the picture quality."
2,Motorola Hasn't fixed Battery Bug,"This phone has many nice features- great ring tones, good picture quality, Prince of Persia game and also has optional features like linking caller ID to your phonebook. However it is a little bulkier than many other phones on the market. It was the hottest selling phone during the Christmas season last year. People were almost fighting to get it due to the limited quantity but like all Motorola phones it suffers from battery bugs that Motorola hasn't seemed to fix in almost all their phones. You charge it for hours and it works for like 45 minutes then turns off. To get it to work again you have to take out the battery and sim card only to have this scenario repeat. Bet those people wished they hadn't fought to get it now. Serves them right."
1,do not buy!!,"this model worked for 8 days then went dark, also do not under any circumstances no matter what kind of deal it looks like, order a phone and plan from cellularchoices.com or inphonic. this company sold me this piece of sh*t motorola then a samsung that worked for 11 days, the rebates are bogus they'll never even send you the rebate form. It took dozens of phone calls and weeks to get my money refunded, the rebates are a scam to make it look like you're getting the phone for free."
4,Good job Motorolla,"I just purchased this phone here in CO and am very happy with it. The most important thing is that it actually does it's job...as a PHONE. Sure it has cool stuff, but the reception is great, no dropped calls, and everyone hears everyone nice and clearly. My only quip is that the phone was packaged with the wrong battery, preventing me from putting the cover on. How many times does that happen??"
2,Bad phone!!!,"I bought this phone after researching it quite a bit and looking at user reviews. It seemed like a good phone, it had a great price on Amazon, and I really loved the idea of the mp3 ringtones. However, this phone stinks. It can go anywhere from no bars to full bars on my signal without moving - sitting in the exact same spot. For no reason, the phone will suddenly lose all signal and HANG. I can't do anything but shut if off and turn it back on, and then proceed to call back the person I was talking to with plenty of apologies at hand. Think twice before buying this phone."
5,Great Phone,"Nothing more to say other than this is a great phone. Has a great deal of functions, camera option is great. Speakerphone is also wonderful but volume on it is kind of low even when volume is all the way up. Other than that phone is great and worth buying."
3,So much for 24 hrs shipping,"I ordered this phone 4 days ago and it still hasn't shipped. So much for the available ""shipped in 24 hrs"" crap."
1,not all that,this phone is a phone i mean has the basic features the wap or browser dont work as well a lot of freezen that sucks the camera has no flash so is a pain in low light enviroment and the mirror is ridiculos comes out blary so is and avreage phone not all that i return it got the e715 is a avreage phone too but look less sporty than this phone and more profesional for business enviroments couple of more features no speaker or voice dialing so no biggie nothing is perfect so this v300 looks like a lets go to swim phone is water resistans or like a small verizon portable talking radio not all that 4 reviews sd dont see meany reviews for this so no meany customers for it and like i said nothing is perfect so lets stop complaining nad both phone are preatty desent and they are with t- mobile came out as the best cell phone company in consumer report so thats what it matters
4,Awesome new toy,"The Motorola V300 is a fun and functional addition to my everyday travels. It has so many features it's hard to describe them all. I really like being able to check my email from anywhere at anytime. I also like the downloadable song snippets that I can set as ringtones. I love that it has talk, text and paging capabilities. The camera is really fun, though the pics are not the best quality. I also love the built-in datebook, it has made my PDA obsolete."
2,Just the cons..,"I like the over all features of the phone but I have had problems.1. Mine might be the only one this has happened to but the silver finish started to come off from the first week to the point now where it is completely gone. Moto and T-Mo states that it is normal wear and tear and refuse to replace it.2. After about 20 min. it drops the call no matter how strong the cell site is. (I had the same problem with my V60).3. The connector pins Moto uses to charge the phone weakens and causes the phone not to charge (the V60 also had this problem since it is the same connector). Spreading the pins back out on the phone side with a needle repaired it.4. Once the battery is low, the phone beeps til you charge it so you choices are charge it, or turn it off.5. The belt holster that comes with it, falls off your belt easier than most.Since it drops calls like the last Moto phone I had, I think I will choose another manufacturer next time."
1,The Worst Mobile,"This is the worst mobile i have ever bought. It automatically ends my call as per it's wish. Though it has got all the good accessories, simply it does not work."
4,It's not that bad...,"I am not saying that the people that have written a review here are wrong. I had some problems, mostly beacuse my company sold me a phone that had been returned to them because it was broken! I was so p****d off, but since I had read some of the reviews here I didn't think to much of the earlier problems. I quickly got a new phone (no previous owners!) and since then it has been working perfect.I like the camera (though that wasn't the main reason for buying it). I am having fun with the cool little personal features...and it works fine.By the way, my main reason for buying the v300 - It's small and it's blue ! :o)"
3,"Great toy, average reception phone","when i first got this phone i was so excited because it was the coolest little toy, however when it came down to it if i want a camera i will buy a camera and if i want to play games i will buy a game boy and when i want a cell phone that gets good reception i will NOT buy this phone. except when i was outside i never got full reception (and lets be honest most of the time people use their phones is inside!) previously i had a samsung s105 and the moto v300 got nowhere near as good reception as the samsung did. bottom line i loved the phone i wished i could have kept it but i need a phone that is going to have good reception inside and the moto v300 i can say did not meet those standards. i ended up w/ the samsung e105 and it gets the best reception of any phones i have ever had."
4,Great phone great value.,"Had this phone for almost a year. Almost no complaints. Has all the necessary functions, although rather useless camera. Recommmend."
1,Stupid phone I ever had,Don't attract with their mail-in-rebates. Key pad is slow responsive or even no responsive some times. I donot even find any good thing in this phone.
2,"Buggy, and stupid external buttons","I've had this phone for a year now, and the cover is terribly scuffed-up even though the TMO salesperson swore it would be more durable... hah! The phone's OS crashes on me at least once every two weeks or so, and I have to remove the battery to get the phone to reboot.The worst thing, though, is Motorola's insistence on having external volume buttons. I can't bend over, sit at my desk, or get in my car without hearing the tell-tale beeps because I've brushed the buttons. Wouldn't be so bad if they could be disabled, but apparently they can't be. What's terrible is when I turn the volume to vibrate mode, but then brush the external buttons and the phone has been turned to LOUD mode. Talk about disrupting a meeting...Not happy with this phone; can't recommend it."
3,So-so phone,"I've had the V300 for more than a year now, and I think this sums it up:PROs:* Keypad and menu are user-friendly* Speakerphone and three-way conference capabilities* Encased in a non-slip material* Durable* Ringtones are niceCONs:* You open the phone to answer, and it keeps ringing for one or two more times before it finally connects.* Heavy* When calls drop, sometimes it just keeps ringing and you can't stop it for the love of sweet Jesus* It shows received calls as missed calls* Calls drop (often), but it doesn't tell you till way later in the ""conversation.""* The camera isn't that greatAs for reception, I think that has more to do with T-Mobile's general suckiness than the phone itself (I think). But all the talk about the charger is incorrect. It does take 2 seconds to show that it's charging, but so? And I've never heard of the volume dropping out, or it switching to silent by it's lonesome.I've been around the world with this phone, and have generally abused it. It has survived."
2,bad phone,"This phone has great features and all but I don't know if it's amazon phones or what. Within 20 days from getting this phone the front screen went blank on us. So we got a replacement. three weeks after that, the large front screen went blank and the keypad did not work. So we called and got our last replacement from amazon, u can only exchange three times. I ask the guy and he said all the phones are brand new. Well we don't abuse our phone at all. We use it just to call home when one of us are out. Never dropped it or anything. It just dies on u. Well the third replacement after a month went blank on us and the keypad don't work. So know we are stuck with a nonworking phone. So becareful when you order this phone."
3,Good Phone At An Okay Price,"Thus far, I've had no major problems with using this phone like other people have had. However, even though I send and receive all my messages (voicemail, text, e-mail, etc.) okay, I did occasionally have a problem with sending text messages and the receiving party not getting them; that's the only problem I've had with this phone so far. The camera feature is fair, in my opinion, because of the overall visual quality of the pictures taken with the phone (the pictures have a somewhat ""grainy"" appearance to them). In short, the V300 is a good phone to buy if it's your first phone and you don't want to pay a lot of money for a simple camera phone with text and internet capabilities. However, I must say that the keys on this phone are small (which is great for me since my hands are small), so I personally don't recommend buying this phone if you have large hands."
3,Longevity issues,"I really like this phone. The organizer, speech recognition and other features are really good. I like the camera, association of images and sounds, the organizer, etc. But, after about 9 months, the speaker in the clam shell started working intermittently, so i needed to put it on speakerphone to hear people. I know of a few other folks who have had similar issues with the clam shell construction. I had a new phone sent to me from the carrier and now I'm back in action, but be forewarned about the wear and tear issue."
1,Everything you heard is true...,"I am also a victim of the ""no sound"" syndrome of the V300. Conversations over the speakerphone is just not right! I just received my third phone, and I'm ready to send it back.T-Mobile did all they could to solve the problem, except for their no exchange policy (they don't offer trade ins.) Based on my conversation with the sales rep and the Amazon reviews on this site, I'm very surprised this phone is still on the market- and it still seems like ""bad batches"" of phones are being sent out!Save yourself some time and embarrasment. Don't bother with this one."
2,A Step Backward,"I've had this phone for a year, with T-Mobile. Reception is good in San Diego & NYC Metro area, where I've used it most. The phone is starting to show problems with the flip. Occassionally the screen is black when you open it, or blacks-out when you press a key. Pressing the earpiece too hard to the ear also sometimes blanks the screen and/or drops the call. Most annoying is the one number per name contact list, and the lookup by only the first letter. I've had Moto's Startec (best phone), Timeport, now this. As they add features, they seem to lose others. Also owned Ericsson and Samsung (S105). I've just ordered a Nokia 6600 and am hoping it will be better."
1,Having trouble with volume,"I wont recommend this phone to any one. I own this phone for year and half, and in very first few weeks I started having trouble in charging the phone. They sent me a new phone, since it was under warranty. Now for last 2 months I can't hear people from otherside, callers are also mentioning that my voice is breaking up. Offcourse warranty is over now."
2,"Nine weeks, no rebate","Mailed in my rebate and all the attending forms in early February. The status on the online rebate center has shown in-process forever. Cmon, 9 weeks? While it's too early to say I'm getting ripped off, this extended time frame doesn't bode well for the people Amazon chooses to do their rebate processing. Think twice before you bite on the rebate lure.The phone, with T-Mobile service is okay. Half of the calls will be dropped about 10 minutes in, and the battery life is nowhere near as stated. The phone itself seems to be pretty good, although the keypad layout could be more aesthetically pleasing and the keys a tad larger. To do it all over again, I would have bought the v600 for the bluetooth, but the rebates offered on this one at the time were too good to pass up. But the rebates don't matter if you never receive the money promised!"
4,I got it because it was blue...,I have had this phone for almost a year. I haven't had any problems with it at all and my T-mobile service has been great. I have been thinking about going for a device that is easier to send text messages on.
5,A great phone but probably bad service,"I am sorry to see such bad reviews for this phone because I bought it over a month ago and it has been great so far. However, the service i'm using is not T-Mobile so maybe it's the wireless provider.The things I love about this phone are the relatively good picture quality, ability to download stuff,animations for text messaging and the recall feature when your call doesn't get through. I like all the features though. Plus it's real easy to find the applications you want to use. So far I haven't had a problem with the screen or ring tones.The bad thing about is that it's hard to change the face when you're tired of seeing blue all the time. Plus, so many people are buying this phone I'm seeing it everywhere I go!"
2,Not a great phone,"I did not have good luck with this phone. I liked the features that it had, but I did not like how the phone would always lock up on me. I would have to pull the battery in order to get the phone to reset. When I would place a call on hold and take another (2nd) incoming call, I had a hard time getting my original call back. It would say.... ""operation failed"". I would try my old phone, and have no problems with switching back and fourth between calls. My screen would get wierd on my at times. When I would open the phone, sometime it would not recognize that I opened it, or it would take a few seconds. I am not impressed with this phone. I only had the phone 6 months."
5,a really awesome phone,"I got this phone a few days ago as I needed one, and it's on a FamilyTime plan with my brother's phone and my mother's phone. I must say -- this phone rocks.Why I liked it:The colour display is just gorgeous.The camera is pretty good quality for a camphone.The iTAP text-messaging system works very well, I thinkThe phone itself is very prettyIt feels well made when I open it and close itVery user friendly and easy to navigateSome minour gripes:Uneven backlightThe funny shape of the keysThe useless ""How to Use"" guideBut those little problems don't hinder my use of the phone. I really like it, and I've persuaded my elder brother to get one this summer!Definitely worth it!"
2,"cute, but choppy","I had sprint for years and got suckered into buying this by a dealer who sold both. I really wanted a new sprint phone. It took me ten tries to set up the voice mail because the call kept failing. Unfortunately I went out of town and returned one day late or I would have taken it back. There is a 14 day trial period. If you are going to switch to T Mobile, buy a cheap phone or get a free phone first to make sure it works in your area. I was told that were I work is a minimal service area, which translates to 9 out of 10 times the call will fail or cut out. This is not something ideal for your emergency phone."
5,T-Mobile and V300,"I had AT&T service with the old StarTac cell phone for many years. I was never happy with either, so I finally switched to T-Mobile and the V300 by Motorola. What a difference! I get great reception, no dropped calls, got dropped calls all the time with AT&T, and the price is very good. Voices are clear and distinct both on my end and on the end of the person I am calling. Most times they don't even know I am on my cell. The phone comes loaded with ringtones and a few games to get started. The voice activated calling works great. Many of my co-workers and friends have voice activated calling on other cell phones and services, but it hardly ever works for them. I am very pleased with how user friendly it is too. Two thumbs up from me."
1,Beware of this phone,"have owned the V300 for 8 months now, and it is nearly unusable. The screen and picture display is awesome, the ringtones are second to none, and it looks great - but it fails miserably when trying to actually have a conversation. My first V300 would drop all calls every 20 minutes, on the dime. After replacing the battery to no avail, I had T-Mobile ship me out a free replacement. My replacement now drops calls every 8 to 9 minutes! This would be funny if the darn phone didn't cost me so much. I will be getting my third replacement any day now...but after reading all these reviews, I now realize that a fully functional V300 is, as another reviewer stated, a crap-shoot. I intend to keep throwing those dice until I get a working phone from T-Mobile, or until they get tired of sending me replacements, whichever comes first. I highly recommend looking into Samsung instead - I wish I had."
2,Great phone...while it lasts,"This was my perfect phone. I had it for 2 years without a single problem. I loved how everything worked on it, the camera was great, the outside blue cover was perfect so it wouldn't slide around in my bag. But, the receiver speaker died shortly after I passed my two year mark. I had to talk to everyone on speakerphone which was a royal pain. I called T-Mobile and they apparently know about this problem, but still sell the phone. Judging by the rest of the reviews, this has been a problem for a lot of people.The other major problem with this phone is that sometimes it doesn't feel like charging. I would have plugged it in and it would say that it was ""unable to charge"". It only happened a handful of times, but again...juding from the rest of the reviews, it sounds like a major problem.It's too bad the hardware of this phone didn't hold up b/c I loved the features of the phone."
2,Do not buy,"I do not recommened this phone. The phone disconnected my calls everytime I talked more than 20 minutes. I knew 2 other people that this happened to on their V300 phones. I paid $200 when this phone came out, what a waste!"
3,Good phone but the coverage.....,Ths phone is great . However T-mobile coverage limited to the more populated areas and well traveled hwys and in-building coverage is often not so great so YMMV by your coverage needs . Their rates and customer service are great-(which seems to be unusual in the wireless business- definitely worth a try .
2,Not very impressed,"I was quite disapointed with this phone. I was really excited in April when I paid $250 for it. So far, it has given up all hope on charging, ALL the blue on the back has peeled off, when I try to press a button or type a text to fast it takes awhile to catch up, and it is very sensitive about being closed. also it won't let me view texts from certain numbers. as though it hates my friends...I would not recomend it and because of the problems I have had with it Tmobile it replacing it with a samsung for free..."
1,Cute but wait for the other shoe to fall...,Because it will! I've had 4 (FOUR!) of these phones. Luckily T-Mobile has been great about honoring the Manu warranty. Twice the speaker went- both external and internal. Thank GOD for the headset-that was a nightmare! Once when the screen went white- and stayed that way. Now its the charger. I'm hoping that the car adapter that I just ordered will save the day until I get get back to Verizon and a groovy LG phone.By the way- the number storage logic in the V300 SUCKS! Cannot store multiple numbers for same person- ends up as multiple entries in the phone book. Very Poor logic!! Hope Moto reads this- Geez- I used to think they were Quality!
2,too many software glitches,"I have had two of these phones. I sent the first one back to T-Mobile after it kept freezing on me (just like a computer freezes) and they gave me a refurbished unit in exchange. Unfortunately, the second one is only marginally better - it also freezes frequently (1-2 times per week) and sometimes the only way to reset it is to take out the battery and restart it. This phone has nice bells and whistles, but they don't mean much if the phone is so damn unreliable."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased my V300 in March and am now awaiting my 2nd replacement of the original. The second phone does not receive any signal at all. Both phones dropped calls, had a lot of static and echoed. I am hoping that the third time will be a charm, but am not holding my breath. I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
1,many problems,"I have been using this phone for 10-11 months now. It has a number of problems:1. From the time I bought, it has problems with charging. I have to wiggle the wire a number of times until the phone detects that it is possible to charge. While being in charge, it is also possible to run out of battery if you start using the phone!2. Just a week ago, the phone is acting wierd with little reception in most areas here around San Jose and so many failures while making calls or talking.It seems that I have to change this phone soon!"
1,Went through 2 of the same phones,"The first one busted in 2 weeks, I received a replacement, then the second one (same model) busted 6 months later.The problem was the same, I couldn't hear the person that was talking on the other end."
2,POS!,"This phone was garbage! AT random times my screen would just go blank and freeze and then come on a minute later. Everyone in my family has this phone (4 people) and we have had to get 3 family members new phones. Mine would say Unable to Charge when i tried to charge it. My dad's phone had about a 50% chance of dropping the phonecall when he was on the phone and my sister's backlight for her screen broke so she couldn't see her screen in the dark. I am giving the review two stars because (one star) they did replace our junky phones (with more junky V300s) and the second star, you can lock up your apps, pics, etc. The screen is legit, the camera is aight, the degree of customization is respectable, but you get what you pay for. If youre checking out T-Mobile phones, hit up the Sidekick II! $50 back in rebates for a phone that is ten times as good as the V300. But stay away from all of these triplet motorolas, everyone i know has issues with them, they are slow and defective!"
1,Worthless Device,I was so excited when I purchased the Motorola V300. When I recieved the phone it wasn't working. Amazon kept on telling me it was T-mobile's probem. I called T-mobile and they said it was Amazon's problem. I went back and forth calling for three days. It ended up being a problem with the phone. I even took it to a local T-mobile store and they were shocked b/c they never saw this happen on a phone. The phone would say enter the SIM card & it was already inserted. Amazon sent me a new Motorola V300 and it was stating unchargeable. I was so upset because the phone was giving me so much problems!! I was fed up and purchased the Samsung E715. That is one outstanding phone!!! I recieved the phone and it was working in no time. I had absolutely no problems. The Samsung E715 is what you should choose over the Motorola V300. I guarntee you will love it!!! I give it 5 (*****) stars.
5,Amazing phone,"First a quick confession: I do not like T-Mobile. I had them before and hated their (lack of) coverage and bad service.That said, the v300 is a very good phone. I won't rehash the long feature list here. What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling. This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner, maybe that explains the ""girlish"" styling, but it's still pretty cool. Of course, the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out.My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS..."
1,Save yourself the trouble,I purchased 2 of the motorola V300's for my wife and myself. We have not had a call that has not dropped. Both phones are unable recive a signal inside a home or buildinig. They are the most disapointing products I have ever purchased.
3,About the Motorola V300,"I bought the phone being that it was Tri-band and thought it will be useful to me. well, it turns out that one of the locations I am being sent to doesn't have T-mobile connection. I am moving to South Carolina and T-mobile has no connection there. I spent money on a phone and now I can't even use it. I Feel that T-mobile should give you some kind of map that indicates the places your phone is able to work. everything works great though.I would still like a map of places T-mobile's connected to. so, before you purchase the phone first ask if the area you plan on using it in has T-mobile service."
1,what a disapointment,"I bought the motorola v300 phone because it said it was a triband. It may be but you can only use it in the states with tmobile. Im in the military and I had to go back stateside and activate it and when I returned overseas,(where I spend most of my career) it doesnt work. i have a phone I bought almost 3yrs ago in Italy and although it is alot bigger and it doesnt have all the new features and all the gadgets....it works all over the world when I put a different chip in. The phone I bought is motorola and it is for a network called ""TIM"" which is over here in Italy...it still works all over the world. I have even gone to another country and before I bought a chip for that country...it picked up a network as soon as I turned the phone on in the airport. The T-Mobile Motorola V300 is a ripoff."
1,think again!!!!!,I love T-mobile it's the best.. i wanted and up grade on my old flip so i went with the V3oo it sucks it's the worst...screen goes black...the camera isn't clear at all.... it's just not simple and it's way to complicated for my taste... so take my advice n re-think before buying this phone.
2,Dropping calls after 10 minutes,I have noticed that v300 drops calls after 10 minutes. Called the T-mobile helpdesk which offered to replace the phone.It seems to be a known issue for T-mobile.
1,Junk,"Terrible phone. Was just freeze up and go blank or flashing screen wouldn't let me do anything. Had to set it up perfectly to get it to charge and then it took forever cause I would have to keep adjusting the charge plug. Second week I had it, I wasn't able to send or recieve and calls or txt msgs and had to get it fixed. All around garbage."
5,It was the greatest pre- teen girl game ever!!,It had everything a girl would want to play on a software!!
3,Missed the Run Time for This Movie,"I was disappointed by the fact that the actual movie is only about 10 minutes long. Over all the cinematography was well done for a short film, but the length didn't leave much room for any plot. I wish I would have realized that I was paying $1.30 a minute for this movie."
2,Confusing and not well thought out.,"I have a problem with this and other TY books. While the conversations are helpful, most of the exercises are confusing, silly (unscramble a croatian word) and don't provide the correct answers to recheck your own. Furthermore, the book doesn't take the time to explain the subtle nuances between Serbian and Croatian dialects."
1,Poor book...,"There are too many mistakes in this book. It must prevent us from the correct understanding of Croatian language. If you bought this book, you would know what I mean, but I highly recommend buying other book, for example Magner's one."
4,"*sigh* Why do you want to learn Serbian so badly, anyway?","Of what you people say, it's all Croatian and not enough Serbian. That's exactly why i bought it! I have no interest whatsoever in learning Serbian. I'm learning Croatian just for the joy of it (i have absolutely no Balkan lineage), while I could be learning Japanese (That's what I am) and i plan to have a nice experience with it.Oh yes, and the reviewer from Greece really shouldn't give it one star like he/she did for Colloquial Croatian + Serbian (yes I know it's only Croatian, that's why I'm buying it) just because it's only Croatian! Just learn the western variant and then learn the eastern! Or how 'bout not even bothering to review? :)After Croatian I plan to learn Slovene and Russian. Hey, Croatian has a purpose in learning other languages after all, unlike the way SOME people told me (you know who you are).... ^^Ah, well. Hvala lijepa, u zdravje, i do videnja."
4,Right after i clicked save I had something more to say.,"if you want to be challenged a bit, go for Croatian rather than Serbian, in my opinion. I chose Croatian as a challenge. My sister, from what she's seen of Serbian, finds it much easier to retain than their lengthier Croatian equivalents.Hope that helped, at least a bit. Do videnja!"
4,this thing,"It seems to work just fine. A little awkwardly tall, so make sure your surface is low enough to draw/work on.Sturdy, and durable."
3,nothing special,It was exactly as discribed nothing more nothing less. I found it to be too small for my use but in their defence they stated the dimentions.
2,light box review,"I am not unsatisfied with the product, but unhappy withthe price. I later found the same light box almost 30$ less."
