3,OK But Not A Classic,"I'm having trouble summing up what was wrong with this book, but I think it seemed to move too rapidly and not enough time was spent lingering over some of the truly deliciously wicked parts of the story. Coraline's bravery and the creepy fact of this mirror-image world on the other side of a fake door in her house give the right sort of building materials for a great tale, it's just that Mr. Gaiman didn't seem to follow through on the promise this dark little book had at its start. I really did love the cover design for Coraline, and the idea of this sinister pseudo-world lurking so close to our realm is a neat idea. I don't regret reading Coraline, but it wasn't everything I hoped it would be."
5,A spooktacular read,"I was surprised by how closely the movie followed this book, as I had seen the movie long before I picked up this book. It's a great short and spooky read that is perfect for Halloween coming up. Gaiman is a fabulous storyteller.Final Verdict: Definitely a book you do not want to miss. Appropriate for 4th grade and up."
5,My daughter loves it,"I bought this for my daughter because she loves the movie, and this version of the book has pictures from the movie. She absolutely loves it and has already read it several times. A good buy, in my opinion."
3,Nice book for spending time,"I bought this book as something light for reading and it didn't disappoint me. It is well written and fun to read. It catches your attention from the beginning to the end. If you want something fun to read in almost no time, I highly recommend this book."
4,Avoid Buttons at All Cost...,"Neil Gaiman has written a deliciously, wickedly scary book for children, very reminiscent of master children's book writer Roald Dahl. The heroine, young Coraline, is an explorer by her very nature. During a particularly boring day, Coraline borrows an old key from her mother and unmasks a door that leads her to a scary adventure that includes her ""other mother,"" a wicked, evil creation with button eyes who wants Coraline to live with her forever. In the course of the adventure, Coraline must rescue three children who have lost their souls to the ""other mother"" and also Coraline's very own parents, who have been taken captive. Along the way she meets a talking cat who becomes her dear friend and rescuer. I can't wait to read more of Neil Gaiman. He is most famous for his The Sandman comics, which have been wildly popular for years."
4,Creepy Coraline,"This is a book that begs to be read aloud. I read it once and now I can't wait to read it to my little cousins. Neil Gaiman creates an alternate world in which Coraline is wanted by her ""other mother"". She must somehow figure out a way to get back into the real world with her real parents. She has the help of what she thought was a boring stone and also, the black cat. It was very interesting to see how Coraline gets out of the alternate world, and how she gets her parents back. And even after all this, how she takes care of her ""other mother"" for good. Even though this is a YA book and I'm 26, I was still a little scared while reading the story :)This book is very creative and I can see why Gaiman is such a popular author. This was the 3rd book I've read by him and I can't wait to read more."
4,Those buttons give me the willies,"This is a delightfully creepy adventure that I'd recommend to anyone, not just kids! It is humorous, imaginative, sinister, and even downright frightening. Neil Gaiman sure knows how to play with our imagination. The artwork is downright creepy, but fascinating to look at. You won't be able to look at shiny black buttons or a needle and thread in the same way again. Button eyes.... ran chills up and down my spine.Coraline - the movie comes out in 2009. It looks like Dakota Fanning will do the voice for Coraline and Terri Hatcher will do the voice for Coraline's mother and ""other mother"". I can't wait to see it - especially since Henry Selick (The Nightmare before Christmas) is directing - I am a big fan of his."
5,A great book,"Coraline was a very original thriller with a mind-bending twist. I had read The Graveyard Book,(also byNeil Gaiman) and I really liked it. All in all Coraline was a very good book."
2,Rating,II chose two because it a kids book and I understood the movie better than the book n teen should read this book
5,Stay away from buttons!,"Do you want to read a fun exiting adventurous book?! Then you should read the book coraline. It is about a girl that finds a secret door to a different world! And it is also about how she is trying to get her parents back. But when her ""real mother"" wants her to replace buttons for her eyes, Coraline decides to fight back because she knows that this ""real mother"" is the one that kidnapped her actual parents. Can Coraline get her parents back and fight her so-called ""real mother""?"
5,Coraline,This book is scary but fun to read. I couldn't stop reading this book imagine a world were everything and everyong has black botton eyes boy does this book give me the creeps.
3,A Book of Nightmare,"This book starts off very interesting from the very first page, but I kind of wish I didnt read all the other pages! There are things from it I dont want to have in my head. I read it in the day but at night I kept remembering things from it I didnt want to, like how the rat gets blood on its fur but how the Other Mother has something like black tar insted of blood coming out of her. And the hand that scratches around the floor by itself. Its not like Lemony Snicket, where maybe something is scary and then you have a lot of something funny or cozy. Its a lot of scary darkness. Maybe this one is more for teenagers. I wish I didnt feel that way but remembering this book gives me nerves."
3,Kinda ... sorta ...,"I am a huge fan of Neil Gaiman, but I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with this edition of Coraline. For one thing the illustrations hit me like a dissonant chord, removing any sympathy I might have had for the poor girl who is at the center of this perfect storm of her own making.But I think the essence of my discomfort comes from the awareness that present day children are being brought up on a diet of weird spookiness, and while Gaiman's style works well for adults I think it transfers rather poorly into the world of the innocents."
5,Fantastic view into what could be a child's nightmere,"I thought this book has fantastic, it was engaging to read and the story line kept changing i thought there were a few parts that were a lil creepy like them the characters begin ""melting"", i believe it was a result of a few personal nightmares i had while reading the book..lol..however i was not so impressed with the movie.. This book was recommended to me by one of my students and i was quite surprised how much i liked it. i was even more surprised to learn Neil Gaiman the author also write stardust which was a fantastic movie."
3,"An exciting adventure to the ""other"" world!","Coraline is an excellent book in which a girl is taken on an amazing journey. She uncovers more about herself than she ever knew. If you love amazing adventures, you will love this book. It`s an exciting adventure you will never forget!!!-Jess :)"
4,Terrifyingly Good,"This is a story for kids and adults who anticipate suspense in every chapter. Coraline is a courageous young lady who leads a sometimes boring life of a child on summer holiday away from school. Little does she know that that summer is going to turn extremely interesting! With her wit and gutsy spirit she embarks on a journey of saving lives from an evil being. The beginning of the story is quite mundane but when the tale actually unfolds it becomes more and more chilling on every page. Together with jagged sketches that meant to be horrifying (and they are), Mr. Gaiman succeeds again in creating a narrative that deserves an ovation; he has once more crafted fascinating characters and brightly engaged them in bizarre situations with a great sense of humor. Until the final page, the story is stupendously told."
3,cute,I bought this book because the movie was so fun in a grim sort of way.the book is the same.it's a short read from a cchild's perspective.a good easy story to read for yourself or to your kids.
4,Great for giving yourself the shivers,"I am very surprised that there is only one review on this book, and even more shocked that the review itself is a critical one. Yes, there is a bit of horror in Coraline, but to me this made it deliciously creepy. And it is not your typical ""dark and stormy night"" creepiness either. Coraline is very unique, a sort of mixture of science fiction and mystery that blends together perfectly to create a great story, the perfect book for nighttime reading."
3,A decent little read,"Neil Gaiman's, ""Coraline,"" is a dark, moody short novel (160 pages or so) intended for a pre-teen audience that can also be enjoyed by adults as well. Gaiman succeeds in giving his readers a John Bellairs (""The House With a Clock In It's Walls, etc.) type reading experience with a story filled with eerie atmosphere and creepy supernatural beings. Fans of Gaiman's work in the medium of comic books will also appreciate the remarkable black & white illustrations provided by Dave McKean in each chapter. My only nit-pick is that while I was appreciating McKean's artwork along with Gaiman's excellent storyline and characters one can't help but think that perhaps this story would've been better suited as a one-shot graphic novel."
5,Excellent book!,"I bought this to read at night to my boys (almost ages 5 and 8) before bed each night for a while. It took us about 2 weeks to get through and they were so excited each night to see what was going to happen. The writing was simple enough for them to fully understand, yet not babyish at all. It also helped to not make the movie scary for them (the majority of our friends who've seen the movie have said it was scary). They enjoyed pointing out what was different in the movie from the book. Highly recommended!"
3,An Unexpected Tale,Coraline is an unexpected mystery. Coraline moves to a new home and finds a strange world hidden behind a locked door. Coraline must find a way to save her family from a mean and mysterious stranger.
3,Definitly for the young.,"Because my daughter was writng a paper, she was using Coraline as a reference to the genre of like books as Alice in Wonderland and the Narnia books. This was pretty light. Also watched the video. Not impressed. Perhaps you have to be thirteen."
3,Creepy yet Subtle,"A classic horror novel for children. Even though about a young girl, this book will also get boys hooked on reading. Neil Gaiman's best work yet!"
3,Too scary for kids,"This book is definitly way too scary for kids. I'm an adult and I was very scared. It is well written, however, and a real page turner. It's sick and twisted though. Maybe a 12 year old could take it, but I wouldn't give it to anyone younger than that."
2,An Honest Look at Coraline,"I originally read a review of ""Coraline"" in an article posted on the web that sited itself as belonging to some magazine or other, such as ""Time"". The review gushed about Gaiman's brilliance, his ability to capture both adult and young audiences with the novel, claiming it was in the tradition of such greats as Dahl or Carroll, and might even rival the popularity of J.K. Rowling and the infamous ""Harry"". I found absolutely no cause for such praise as this. The book does not match, in my opinion, the captivating characterization of Rowling's Potter series, nor does it touch the surrealistic beauty of Alice's Wonderland. The oompa-loompa vibe is all that remains of Dahl's style, and even that is muted to the point of boring one to tears. Harsh words, but true, nonetheless. By the end of the relatively brief novel, I was skimming pages, anxious to have finished it once and for all."
2,Coraline,"This book was so creepy, I couldn't even finish it! I'd have nightmares every night!!! I was looking at some books in my brother's room, and even though I haven't picked it up in years, when I spotted it, it sent a shiver down my spine. My mom started reading it to me, then she refused to after reading the first few chapters, she said she could tell it was freaking me out!!!!!"
2,Not Gaiman's best,"Not to say that Neil Gaiman is a poor writer, because he is surely one of the most imaginative and talented writers out there, but Coraline falls flat and is definitely not his best work. It is an undeveloped story with characters lacking depth. The peripheral characters (Coraline's neighbors) seem be tossed in to add some fleck of color, but add nothing to the experience. I know Gaiman seems to be exploring the children's market with other books like Wolves in the Walls (which is only worth purchasing for the illustrations, really), but his talents lie in other genres and should stick with it. There were some moments that were creepy, I admit, but this story doesn't belong in book form. (It would've made a great Twilight Zone episode). All in all, stay away from Gaiman's children's books and read the Sandman series or his other works intended for grown-ups."
1,....read Thief of Always instead,"...this book seems to be a rip off of Clive Barker's ""Thief of Always"" ...which is a much better book...I recommend that instead."
3,"Good book, poor condition","Was happy to finally read this book, but was sad to see it arrived soaking wet. Not sure if that was the fault of the seller or just the shippers in general, but it certainly put a damper on the experience (no pun intended). As far as content, the book is good, but obviously it is about fifth grade reading level, and it is quite similar to the movie."
5,good book! Shipping soon!,"I love Neil Gaiman's books, and this one is my favorate. I saw the movie first then got this book, it arrived 2 days after I placed the order, really fast!"
3,"""... after all, it is always easier to be afraid of something you cannot see.""","I read CORALINE because I'd heard lots of people say they loved it. I did not love it. I did not much like it either. It didn't scare me. And I don't know if it would have when I was a kid either. It's hard to say. I think now, as then, I need more depth of story, more than the premise of a bright girl being ignored/neglected then scooted to a new reality, where she realizes ""there's no place like home"" and Mom.The best line of the book is the title of this review: ""... after all, it is always easier to be afraid of something you cannot see."" I absolutely believe this."
5,LOVE all things Gaiman,"Gaiman is brilliant to read, whatever his story is. He completely grips you--even in this young children's tale! I love being a first-time Coraline reader in my 20's--and plan on introducing it to plenty of kids in the future!"
4,I'm not going to give this one to my grandchildren!,"Of course, I bought it for them in the first place. BUT, when I read it, it scared ME--and I think it would terrify THEM. There's something so very realistic about the Other Parents, something that lives in the nightmares of every child, and putting words and illustrations to it only makes it worse.The writing is terrific, the mood darker than the belly of a cow, and though the ending is satisfactory--even happy--there's a shivery feeling left behind.Of course, I still believe there are things under the bed, and in dark corners and at the ends of dark hallways, so perhaps I am not the best one to talk about frightening children. . . ."
4,The Great Coraline,Coraline is about a girl named Corline who just moved into a new house and she meets some odd people. There is a door and Corline keeps wondering what's behind the door her mother tells her that's there's nothing behind the door. One night her parents didn't come home so she opens the door and goes to a place that looks like her house. I would recommend this book because it's really good they're even making a book about the book. I would highly recommend this you read this book or see the movie they both are really good. I say the movie is better. If you read the book you should recommend the book it to someone and tell him/her to read it. Trust me it's real good. It is even a real good mystery book also.
1,Incomplete Product,This product sold in retail stores contains a starter printer cartrige. The product you sell does not and to buy one it cost more than the printer. I returned it. On a positive note the return process was quite easy except for the packaging materials which cost me $15 because I damahed the origional materials opening the shipment.
4,Great copier,"Have had mine for about 3 years. (...) It also came with s starter toner cartridge. Copies as soon as you turn it on, no warm up necessary. Copies come out very well.If you can do with out a feeder, auto staples etc., this is a great copier for the home office."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Rehashed text (from Suzuki brochures), amateurish and out-of-focus photos, a true waste of money. Two excellent alternatives: Suzuki GSX-R750 by Rob Simmonds and Suzuki Gsx-R750 by Gary Pinchin are the only books to buy."
5,forgot,"I forgot to mention the babes they picked up on the way. I think this also has Ava Lake/Mia in this also, who is also fantastic. She plays a PI following the two guys/dufiouses."
3,Bought this as a gift,"for my parents, who are into that new age'y stuff. They love it - this double album is actually pre-Paul Winter's switch to New Age, so it was a treat for them - jazz.I cannot say I've listened t it, but my folks like it."
3,"Grab Your Guns, Boys...They're Robbing the Bank!","Like several other reviewers, I latched on to this book thinking it dealt with present-day folks defending themselves against criminals. In point of fact, this book by Robert and John Waters relates Old West and Depression-era shootouts between bank robbers and enraged local citizens. It's exciting reading but not what I expected.The stories in OUTGUNNED are a combination of well-known failed robberies and little-known bungled attempts. Exploits by famous outlaws - Jesse James, the Daltons, Pretty Boy Floyd - are intermixed with those of robbery rejects like Adam Richetti. There really isn't any rhyme or reason to the order of the different chapters. Chronologically you jump back and forth from events circa 1915 to 1897 to 1938. And, if the thread that holds the stories together is bank robberies, why then is a chapter devoted to Tom Horn who was a killer but never a bank robber?All in all, a somewhat interesting but still optional choice."
4,Not what I expected,"I bought this book because I thought so highly of Mr. Waters' book, ""The Best Defense."" This is also a good book, but the subject is not what I was expecting. I should have read the commentary and reviews more carefully.I was expecting more stories of people who had defended themselves with a firearm, but this book doesn't really cover that subject. This book is about people who banded together to defend their communities against outlaws. It is not about personal protection.Most of the stories are about bank robberies and how the local citizenry thwarted them. The most recent event covered in this book occurred in the 1930's. This is primarily a history book.Although the book could have been edited better, Mr. Waters has done his research well, and he gives a good accounting of each of the covered events. If you are looking for this sort of thing, you will enjoy this book. I was looking for something else."
2,Too drying,"This soap is very drying to skin. The packaging is boring compared to the competition out there (Softsoap, B&B works, Tone). The soap lathers well and is antibacterial, and those the only reasons it gets 2 stars from me. Although the smell does linger on your hands after youve washed them, it's a boring ok-my-hands-are-clean smell. The soap is way too drying for me to recommend to anyone."
1,"Ha, I say ughh!",If you liked this movie I know a great psychiatrist who can help you. If you cried in this movie The Happy Farm would gladly have you. Do you really think that someone as annoying as Keaton could direct an animated flick? The people on the set probably acted as best they could ( which isn't too good) so that the movie would be over and they couldn't hear Keaton's squeaky voice any more! Good luck sitting through this!
2,Forget this watered-down adaptation: BUY THE BOOK!!!!!!!,"Diane Keaton's film of Franz Lidz's dark, hilarious memoir bombed in the States - amid charges of anti-Semitism - and it's easy to see why. It's norra lorra laffs. Lidz's book about his four (count 'em - 4, not 2!) crazy uncles and his borderline-crazy father has a Dickensian scope and a Joycian dynamic. His view is gently ironic, and propelled by pace, bite and pathos. In this movie, simplification and scaling down - plus huge Hollywood compromises and significant changes in ethnicity - lose the balance. A great opportunity lost and, ultimately, a terrible shame."
3,Lacks Memoir's Effortless Brand of Storytelling Brilliance,"This semi-comic update of the world crystallised by Samuel Beckett charts the disastrous involvement of laidback dopehead Sidney ""The Sid"" Lidz (Turturro) in a kidnapping case involving the wife of his millionaire namesake (Watt). The Sid is hired as bagman and of course finds himself increasingly at risk as he makes his way around an L.A. populated by the rich, strange and dangerous. Nor do his bowling buddies help: Arthur (Chaykin) is several pins short of a strike; while Richards, a crazed, irascible Vietnam vet, is so determined to stand his (and The Sid's) ground that he causes more trouble than he solves. What this all has to do with Franz Lidz's memoir ""Unstrung Heroes"" is anybody's guess. (Not mine)."
2,Turns Literary Champagne into Cinematic Kool-Aide,"The previous reviewer from Tempe, Ariz. seems to be one of those film studies majors who has never set foot in a bookstore. The book was hysterically funny and full of all sorts of deeply-felt observations about life and family. The film is a sugary confection made for mass consumption that insults viewer and reader alike with its reliance on knee-jerk sentiment and silly capers. What an opportunity missed! The book was dark and subversive, the apaptation is honeyed and hackneyed."
1,Give me a break!,"ANYONE WHO WOULD EVEN CONSIDER LIKING THIS PIECE OF JUNK CLEARLY WORKS IN A KLEENEX FACTORY. CRAZY UNCLES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CRAZY, NOT PREDICTABLE ECCENTRICS FROM SOME STUPID SITCOM. AND I SAW WHY THIS WAS BADLY DIRECTED AS SOON AS THE CREDITS ENDED, DIANE KEATON MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP. ALSO I SEE WHY SOME KLEENEX FACTORY WORKERS ENJOYED IT TOO, IT MADE THEM REALIZE HOW EXCITING THEIR LIVES ARE. GIVE ME A BREAK PEOPLE, AND STOP TRYING TO SAY THAT TOP FIVE MOVIES ARE MOVIES THAT WERE ONLY OPEN FOR TWO DAYS IN THEATRES."
4,Great way to watch a movie,"The movie was easy and instant to down load and view. The cost was very affordible. I love that I can take the movie anywhere to watch. No fuss, no muss."
3,What A Missed Opportunity!,"This sappy, syrupy reworking of a splendid memoir is only affecting because it manipilates audiences by focus group-tested Hollywood formula. Sadly, the filmmakers were too callow to take even minimal risks and follow the book, which is exciting and volatile and genuinely affecting. The memoir survives on its honesty -- the film is hollow from its first false frame to its last. Only John Turturro's brilliant performance redeems this cheap, commercial project. But then, what else would you expect from Disney?"
2,"Quaint, Neutered Cuteness","In its quaint, neutered cuteness, the word ""quirky"" has become an oxymoronic cliche - a way of making unconventionality seem blandly conventional. Quirky is the perfect word for the characters in this cinematic bastardization of a great, moving book. The four mad uncles have been reduced to a couple of only-in-the-movies harmless eccentrics. Trying for a dark-toned comedy of familial mishap, director Diane Keaton dips into the sentimental fraudulence of the Harold and Maude crazy-people-are-more-in-touch-with-life-than-the-rest-of-us genre. But the black hole of the film is Michael (Kramer) Richards, who's opaque when trying to play a character with hidden depth. His ""demetia"" is weightless, and so, finally, is Unstrung Heroes."
3,"A Sad, Sidesplitting Memoir That Hollywood Just Didn't Get","This is what happens when a genuinely funny, and touching memoir is eviscerated by Hollywood hacks. The unflinching book was full of whimsy and gentle irony; the film trades on sentiment and New Age wisdom. The book brings to life a whole gallery of strange and wonderful people. The film softens all their edges (or eliminates them entirely) and becomes a golden-hued dying-mother tearjerker that's undone by its shaky premise that crazy people are more in touch with life than their rational counterparts. It tries too hard to make lunacy endearing, and its rosy approach to terminal illness makes it all seem phony."
2,Doesn't Approach the Book's Genius On Any Level,"The psychedelic era's silliest secret agent is resurrected in a world that's moved on three decades. John Turturro (as Sidney Lidz) gets so much of the detail right, it's easy to take his resourcefulness for granted. Everything, from Sidney's velvet frock coats and frilly shirts to the casting (Andi McDowell's slinky sidekick Vanessa Kensington, scheming henchman Richards, and Watt's Basil Exposition, the Ministry Man who explains the plot) demonstrate how much Turturro, the creator of Barton Fink, enjoyed doing his homework. Someone, however, should have weeded out the dud gags and dissuaded Turturro from playing the villian (Ash) as well. Overall, it would take a stone face not to crumple at Sidney's dodgy catchphrases and irrepressible sexual desperation. ""Shall we shag now, or shag later?"" Soon, baby, soon."
2,A Good Movie For people Who Can't Read,"I'm from a dysfunctional family, too - but more like the one in the book, not as cute and unthreatening as the one in the film. Interestingly, the moviemakers Disneyfied Uncle Arthur into a compulsive collector of wedding-cake ornaments. The trove of flea market knickknacks assembled by the cinematic Arthur was hygienically boxed and labeled as if in a Hold Everything catalogue display. Evidently, the reality of moldering cardboard and cockroach-teeming newsprint didn't fit the director's Metropolitan Home esthetic."
2,As nutty as lemon meringue pie,"Too much of a bad thing can be terrible. It's fish 4 days old, I wouldn't buy it. Or even rent it. The movie drips with treacle. Whoever said they cried during this movie must have an open canister of tear gas left around the house. Insanity runs in MY family, infact it practically gallops. But this adorably silly family acts more like silly putty."
3,A workable text but nothing special,"As a college writing instructor, I've used several texts for freshman composition, including this one. While Axelrod and Cooper cover the bases from pre-writing through revision and include a variety of interesting essays for analysis, this is just another composition text. Visually, it is unexciting, and the impact of technology on writing today is not addressed as it should be. Also overlooked are the needs of international students and students for whom English is a second language. Bottom line: it's easy to find other texts that are better than this one."
4,Stellar casting...,"This is a gentle, cosy little murder mystery lifted above average by the stellar addition of not only Bill Nighy but also the one and only, fabby-dabby Geraldine McEwan. The running time of 2 hours doesn't allow for much in the way of complexity of plotting but it's really the gentle humour in this that's the important thing rather than the mystery.Bill Nighy plays out-of-work actor Charles Paris who, through his friendship with Hugo (Paul Ritter), gets sucked firstly into the mahvelous-dahling world of am-dram and then into the investigation of a murder. Geraldine McEwan gives a lovely performance as Charles' mother, part dotty old lady, part leftover wild child from the bohemian world of the Swinging Sixties. The other cast members are excellent too and the script is typical BBC4 comedy time fare - unchallenging but amusing. A very pleasant way to spend two hours - recommended."
5,Just Great,"What a voice. I now own all 4 of his albums and each one adds something new. Night to Night has a bit of a rock feel to it (just fine by me), but it's still Geoffrey's voice that carries you from song to song. Geoffrey seems to have no bounderies. I can't wait for his next album."
5,"Albuquerque in Our Time: 30 Voices, 300 Years","An excellent history of the City of Albuquerque. I found the book entertaining, informative and very well researched. I recommend the book to anyone interested in the history of New Mexico."
2,A very simple book...,I read this book in an hour an a half. I feel for Jodie and her search for her daughter. It's a nice story. I felt that it was an easy read. I think this is an ok first book.
3,Cannot seem to find correct space exploration book...,"I found this as the only/automatic (featured?) selection item when searching for ""National Geographic space"" ; originally, was trying to find a nice overview & history of space exploration book published by National Geographic. Just odd or weird, i think."
3,If you had heard the,"Here is a clip of the real Paban Das Baul classic ""parojanome"" from late 70s when he was a teenager![...]or search ""Baul Musicians from India"" on youtube.The difference between this beautiful original and the ones on this CD that's packaged and marketed for this globalization era is obvious. But I guess those of us who had the opportunity to enjoy his songs first hand in rural West Bengal in those days, shouldn't criticize either since our taste couldn't quite offer the artist an alternative and viable market for the original art form to prosper."
3,Paban Das and Sam Mills,"I must say that this album did not excite me so much. I have been listening Paban Das since my childhood days in various fairs in West Bengal. He sounds best when he is singing and playing his Dubki himself. The track ""Parojanome"" should be played withEktara and dugi along with the other instruments. The track ""Basundharar Buke"" by Paban Das is best recorded in an album called ""Pagla Ghora"". Fusion with Baul does make sense to me but this could have been done better (except may be the second track in this album)."
4,This Made Me Want to Read More Buchwald & Go to Paris!,"While I had heard of the legendary Buchwald, I had never read any his books or his popular newspaper column. After having read this, though, I would consider myself a fan.This delicious memoir chronicles Buchwald's experiences in Paris -- finding love, studying on the G.I. bill, getting his first job at the much-revered ""Trib"" (Herald Tribune newspaper). He recounts these times with a nostalgic air permeated with his delightfully self-effacing wit.The book stirrs an amazing desire to want to throw yourself in a jet and fly to Paris as Buchwald lovingly describes the food and places that shaped his trip.You may even want to read this book just for the cameos by famous writers, musicians, and politicians. It seems that Buchwald bumped into just about every 20th-century history maker during his time in Paris. (The part about Ginsburg and Picasso is wonderful!)"
4,Light and fun to read!,"I picked up this book at the used bookstore not knowing anything about Art Buchwald; I was more interested in reading about a person living in Paris than I was about Mr. Buchwald himself.I thought the book was delightful and I came away liking Art. His stories are funny, touching and sad, but always mixed up enough to keep the book lively and fun. I consider it light reading; a great escape from the office at lunchtime."
4,Witty tribute,"Heard the taped version of I'LL ALWAYS HAVE PARIS: AMEMOIR, written and read by Art Buchwald . . . Buchwald hasalways been one of my favorite humorists/columnist, though Iregret that he doesn't appear in my local paper.This book is a follow-up to his earlier LEAVING HOME . . . it is a witty tribute to 1948 Paris, a city he fell in love with as he began his quest to become a great writer . . . there are a lot of cute stories, plus much name-dropping (Hemingway, Bacall, etc.).I also liked hearing about how he met and fell in love withhis wife . . . his trials and tribulations as a father also had me laughing . . . as he notes, ""...""Overall, I enjoyed it . . . though this is one time wherea professional reader would have helped . . . Buchwald's voiceis not the easiest to understand--or at least not on these tapes."
3,A bit of nostalgia,"I used to read Art's column and once I heard him speak. He is, to me, an icon of what newspaper people used to be like. The book was a delightful remembrance of an age gone by...with all the celebs he was pals with and all the antics. Surface stuff but fun and lots of humor."
4,A PERFECT GIFT FOR THE SPORTS FAN,"I should know, I own it!!! I have grabbed these books since 1998, and they are superb. The only thing I do not like about the ESPN Sports Almanac, is that sometimes, there is a misprint, but it is rare. This is a superb book for anyone who wants to know the all time and previous year records in baseball, football, hockey, nascar racing, formula racing, golf, tennis, and basketball. But these sports are not the only ones covered in this extra thick publication. You will get info on Olympic sports including gymnastics, bobsledding, skiing, track & field, etc. The book covers the previous year in sports headlines, It has tons of information on off the wall sports like badminton and rugby, and it comes from the favorite sports people of America, ESPN. Enough said!!!"
1,Good Information but won't help you pass the exam,"The book seems to be pretty well written. Like most computer books there were a number of technical and gramatical errors, but the main problem is that the study guide does not map to the exam objectives as well as it should. I used this as a supplemental text, but also bought another Test Prep book"
3,fast shipping,The product is quite strong. The packaging was horrible. I personally wouldn't order from this seller again. The product did not smell fresh. It seemed to be sitting in the bottle for a long time. I just had a different odor in mind from previous purchases of Sandalwood Ylang-Ylang oils I have ordered in the past.
1,Hound Of Heaven,"The poem by Francis Thompson is a wonderful, thoughtful little book that I read in the past and wanted to obtain a copy for future review. My diffulty was not seeing the book before I received it. I found the copy you sent which said on it that it cost $l.00 was in terrible condition physically. The cost to me was ten times the original. If I wanted to give the Hound of Heaven as a gift, I would be insulting the receiver. Too shabby."
5,Living Proof That Not All Artists Are Made In A Studio,"I've read other reviews posted here and what I think they have all failed to touch on is this: Live is the proof in the pudding! If you can listen to the stripped down to guitar versions of some of their most popular songs they render here like only they can, and NOT have chills listening to Annie break her heart up into pieces and vocalize it, then you are the one who placed the chill in her heart.Watch Dave look at her as she sings and pick up on when she is going to hold a note out and when she is not while backing her with nothing but a few strums of a guitar! THAT! Is the meaning of ART. Listening to the different arrangements they have come up with for some of their most popular songs is reason enough to buy this DVD."
2,Not for the half-hearted Eurythmics follower like me...,"I must admit that virtually as soon as I bought this DVD (out of curiousity because many other reviewers are in the ""gotta see them live"" camp) I wondered if I'd done the right thing; when I played it I SO much wanted to justify my purchase but alas cannot; there is energy, yes, but little variety - all musicians apart from Dave S are subordinate & the performances, to me, are formulaic; I almost cut it off after the first 6 tracks but skipped forward to ""Walking on Broken Glass"" & ""There must be an Angel"" &, thankfully found some comfort in the familiarity of these & the (few) songs which followed. Bottom line: fine for true fans but not for the half-hearted."
1,DVD quality good. Quality of the Eurythmics: HORRIBLE!,"I was given this DVD as a gift. My friend knew I liked 80s/new wave music. The technical aspects of this DVD are fabulous. Great picture & sound quality.But The Eurythmics are terribly bland. Boring synth melodies run together to create this collection of unmemorable songs. If anyone else has received this as a gift, I pity you."
4,Eurythmics Live..I can say no more.,"Very Good Live Concert..Excellent Picture,Excellent Sound.And the Camera Work is VG+.Dave Stewart is getting some real nice Guitar Tone and he also plays some Sweet Slide Guitar on Missionary Man.Annie Lennox is having Fun from the Start and her Vocals Cook.She has a Great Presence on Stage and a Very Good Trio of Backup Singers.The Band Rocks with Dave and Annie.This is a Very Good Concert to Watch and even just Listen to.They play like 21 songs here.So if you are a Eurythmics Fan this is a Must Have DVD.If you have heard their songs but never bought any of their CD's then this is an EXCELLENT LIVE MUSIC ANTHOLOGY for you.I can say no more."
5,True Artistry at its Best!,"The latest reunion of Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart has produced an amazing concert with sheer artistry in both Annie's great voice, sense of drama, and Dave's music writing and guitar playing. I mostly enjoyed how the songs were rewritten and presented in a new light which added new life to the ""oldies"". You could see the effort put into the whole concert and Annie even nearly loses her voice a couple of times, but the vigor and passion she puts into each song are unsurpassable. However, I got a tinge of sadness as I realized that this could be the last time they would be performing together as a duo in a live concert setting, and one has to admit, they have reached their 50's already. Despite this, I will cherish this concert as one of the best they have ever given."
2,What an insult! Poor Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan......,"What were they thinking? Micheal Brooks, get a grip! Probably the worst remix of qawali and certainly of NFAK to date. Not in the least bit innovative or artful. I'm surprised that someone would do this to the celestial voice of one of the greatest musicians ever to be heard on this mortal earth. sad, very sad."
3,Atrocious Spelling,"I love Archer's short stories, but the spelling errors that occur during the conversion to the Kindle format are numerous. Apparently the computer spell checker that was used changes ""the"" to ""die"" quite frequently. Poor spelling and punctuation permeates the Kindle offerings and really make me second guess my decision to go with Kindle books. I would give the bound book 5 stars, but the Kindle version only rates 3."
2,Good only if your desparate to see some characters again,"A ""Prisoner"" collection with only one episode featuring Jim Fletcher and Vera ""Vinegar ****"" Bennett?! No Karen Travers, Lynn Warner, nor (what?!) Franky Doyle? No ""...like a concentration camp"" episode? Correction: They do appear in a hackneyed flashback episode on Disc 2, recalled by characters from long after my local station's run of the series.)This set is an overview of the ENTIRE series. Each episode on this collection is presented without context (this was, after all, a soap opera)with huge gaps in the storyline. It's good for revisiting old faves (and hearing that closing theme song), but not much else.There is a second American release with the first four episodes, but if you want to relive the series (and get others hooked), there is an Australian release of every episode available on the PAL format. (Bea Smith leaves at #400 if you need a cut-off point.)"
3,Patchwork quilt of episodes,"I was so excited to buy this series - I had been totally hooked on it in the early 80's in Southern California. I should have paid heed though to one of the earlier reviews that mentioned it was difficult to enjoy disconnected episodes. The DVD is great - the episodes were great. BUT, only getting to watch one episode with no follow-up left me very dissatisfied. I would much rather they put the show out season by season.I'm actually sorry I bought this DVD......"
5,For those unhappy with the DVD set,"PCB.H is an amazing show that ran for years. Even though it's from the 1970's onwards it's still a very addictive watch. Some episode might be missing on the DVDs. If you are unhappy with that you can always watch ALL episodes from the beginning of the series until the end, uploaded by GueenBea on Youtube for free. You decide."
3,nice vehicle for attractive newcomer,"This Playboy/Eros offering has the glossy production values we've come to expect, but there's another reason to seek this one out. Although the video box photo features another actress (who actually plays the best friend, not the lead), the star of this film, and reason enough to see it, is the lovely Samantha McConnell. She's quite new to films, appearing previously only in supporting roles in ""Beauty Betrayed"" and ""Passion's Peak"", and she brings a refreshing innocence and sweetness to her role as the college student seeking to widen her erotic experiences. She also has a beautiful, natural body and conveys a sense of genuine enjoyment in her sex scenes. Here's hoping we see her a lot more!"
3,Better than average,"Samantha McConnell, sometimes billed as (and really named Renee Rea), is indeed the best part of this movie, as she was in Beauty Betrayed, Fast Lane to Malibu, and Fast Lane to Vegas. She appears to be genuinely warm, natural, and even a little innocent. She gives a delightful human face, and some acting ability, to this genre.The movie is one of Playboy/Eros's better offerings, and the scenes in which Samantha/Renee strips on stage and has a threesome with Brandy Davis (from Eros's Testing the Limits) are particularly hot. Otherwise, the film is a collection of cliches--a mandatory dominatrix scene, a lame ""Eyes Wide Shut""-type orgy, etc. The real question is why Samantha/Renee never hooks up with the gorgeous and sexy roommate from the box cover.Again, not bad, but Beauty Betrayed, Testing the Limits, and Fast Lane to Malibu are all better choices."
3,Playboy - I'm Watching You,The movie itself was very good but it wasn't the same one I saw before on Cinamax cause all of the good parts were edited out.
2,More Work Needed,"Daniela may be a good actress, but singing is a whole other story.I thought that her voice would have matured by now since she is 13 years old. I think she needs more work with her singing.She still sounds like Luz Clarita when she sings. I hope that her voice changes soon, because I may not buy her upcoming albums."
3,This is nice!,"If you're a fan of power metal don't miss out on this album. Vision Divine does much better the second time around. My favorite tracks in this album include Pain, Black and White, The Call, and A Taste of Goodbye. This gets a 3/5 is because they have nothing truly spectacular but it's all worth a listen. If you crave more power metal and feel you've dried the well, then give these guys a listen."
4,"Laberynth fans, you should buy this CD","Vision Divine 2nd album is all what I expected. Very similar to Laberynth's style of power metal, Vision Divine follow the same sound and lyrics they created in their first self-titled album.Although I consider the first album superior, I really enjoyed this new songs they show to us in this album. Songs like ""Send me an Angel"", ""Away from you"" and the power metal version of A-ha's ""Take on me"", are just some of the excellent masterpieces contained in this album.If you haven't heard the first album, try to buy that one first,it is a 5 star album, better than any Laberynth album. After hearing Vision Divine's first album you will feel thirsty to get your hands into ""Send me an Angel""."
5,Awesome!,"I recently drove to Toronto to visit my sister and discovered this wonderful band. I had never heard of them, but when I heard one of their songs on the radio I decided to buy one of their CDs. I am so glad that I did.Beautiful Midnight has a wide variety of songs on it, and they are all good. There are some rocking songs and there are also some slower ones, but the thing that makes them all great are the lyrics and the vocals. I like to describe the CD as Matchbox 20 on steriods.If you are into good rock music with good lyics, I highly recommend that you purchase this disk. You won't be disappointed."
5,BEST cd ever by the BEST band ever!,"First thing I need to say is....The BEST!!!! No CD by any other band is this amazing. I got the CD when it first came out, Fall of 1999 and it`s still my favourite! I listen to it almost every day and never get tired of hearing the songs over and over like some other CD`s....I can`t wait til Spring this year when MGB`s new album, The Audio Of Being comes out, I`ll get that right away! This band is simply the BEST and I would recommend this CD to ALL rock/alternative fans....By the way, seeing the Matthew Good Band live is even better then listening to the CD, I would also recommend going to a MGB concert if you ever have a chance....It`s INSANE!"
5,mathew GOOD!!! band,"i just purchased this album because i was listening to it in a record store,and i must say ""why in the world has nobody really heard of matthew good band?"" this album is spectacular. never a dull moment. from the beginning of ""giants"" to the finale of ""running for home"", this album has it all. the song ""running for home"" brought me to tears. and the song, ""hello time bomb"" is a masterpiece. this album will never leave your cd player,and it will never leave mine. i have not had the chance to see them live,but the second i hear that there are coming then i will buy tickets in a heartbeat. the song ""strange days"" is so inspiring. you must purchase this album before MGB becomes a hit and the record goes flying off the shelf,and i believe this will happen very soon."
1,From a Matt Good fan...,"I'm not going to waste my time reviewing the album's content. I just want to give you all one piece of advice: buy the Canadian copy of this album. This claims to be the explicit version, yet the non-offensive words ""machine gun"" and ""kill"" have been censored. Confused? Also included are a couple of songs that weren't even released on this album, but other albums."
3,Mathew not so great band,"I first heard the song Hello timebomb and I was impressed,it sounded kinda weird but it was well written and catchy,and the song grew on me and I really liked it.So when I saw that on amazon it had gotten 5 stars I said that I had to get the cd.And was I suprised,I was expecting a hard rock album seeing that it is parental advisory but what I got was a bunch of slow songs,very soft and barely any sound but the guys voice,(which can get very annoying).But I give the band some credit for hello timebomb and for that I give it 3 stars because the song rocks."
1,Good for Nothing,"while Matt Good's Avalanche was one of the best Cd's i've ever purchased, this one was absolutely terrible. I really don't reccomend it at all.. there's not a single good song on it."
1,Don't buy it - the paint chips off,"My twin boys enjoyed this toy for a while, but I noticed that the paint on the key fob was chipping off. The toy is designed for young, teething babies. Having the paint chip off in their mouths is unacceptable! Based on the poor construction of this item, I do not recommend it."
4,The Magic!,This was an awesome movie!The talents of N'sync's Justin Timberlake are great.Maggie Lawson as playing the un-popular high schooler and the teenage model...spectacular!
4,Journey in your Mind,Sheila Chandra's voice has matured into a marvelous instrument. This CD is ideal for blocking out the world and allows the listener to travel the drone deeply into an inner conscience.
1,Highly overrated,"I think that this musician is highly overrated, and this CD in particular has been getting some good reviews even though it doesn't really do anything. Sheila's voice was used to reasonably good effect on her other albums, but here, her looping high pitch leads to some embarrassing results. Honestly, how can anyone sit through something like this without cringing?I suppose that New-Age music lovers have made it fashionable to state that they're into 'exotic Indian fare', which would explain why people rave about this singer's work even though most of it is a) unoriginal , b) boring and c) lacks content. Sure, shes pretty enough and is passable but to, like some reviewers, call her the 'find of the century' is going a bit too far. At best, this CD is silly and unnecessary and yet another attempt by Real World Records to put up obscure stuff on the shelf, package and market it well, and watch it sell by the dozen.Highly forgettable."
5,Dreamtime Star Journey!,"I have several of Sheila Chandra's albums but ABoneCroneDrone is the one I play most often. Few can truly apreciate the power of droning. If you enjoy the chanting of Tibeten Monks or, especially, the drones of the Australian didjeridu, you will love this album. Ms. Chandra's voice is pure magic."
5,marble halvah bar,This product came so fast that I couldn't believe it. It came alongside another barthat was chocolate-covered because the lady I bought it for had never had one and I thought she'd like the chocolate covered one best. I got the marble halvah bar formyself since that was what I used to buy at the grocery store twenty years ago. I had been having a craving for this bar and after I received it; I ate it up so fast.But now I know where I can get more if I get another craving.
5,THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE FOR LINEN POSTCARD COLLECTORS!!,"IF YOU ARE STARTING TO COLLECT LINEN CARDS OR ALREADY A COLLECTOR, YOU CAN'T BE WITHOUT THIS BOOK!Linen postcard collecting has got to be the the fastest-growing area within the larger hobby of postcard collecting. The appeal is obvious--the cards evoke a definite period in American history, from the early 1930s to the '50s--but it is still possible to get in on ""the ground floor"" and start or expand on a great collection, whatever your budget. Mark Werther and Lorenzo Mott's LINEN POSTCARDS: IMAGES OF THE AMERICAN DREAM is the ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL REFERENCE BOOK ON LINEN COLLECTING. It is not just another picture book with a little history tossed in: It EDUCATES the reader on how to look at cards, how to go about finding good cards--HOW TO BUILD A COLLECTION. I've consulted it again and again over the past year, and it continually adds to my appreciation and enjoyment of this field."
4,"Exiting, Passionate and Shocking","Victoria Fontaine's mischievous nature and brilliant, biting wit have scandalized the ton...and earned her the nickname ""Vixen."" But her reputation pales before the infamous Lord Althrope's, known as ""Lord Sin."" The years Sinclair Grafton spent on the Continent have done nothing to quell the rumors about his past. And when the stunning Vixen and the handsome rogue find themselves momentarily alone at an elegant gala, their passion gets the best of them.Caught by Victoria's father in a shockingly sensual kiss, Sin and Vixen have no recourse except a wedding. At first the very liberal lady relishes the thought of an unfettered marriage to an indifferent, unrepentant scoundrel. But she suspects there is more to this enigmatic, remarkable man, that his rakish persona is merely a pose. And after one unforgettable night of ecstasy, Lady Vixen is determined to unmask the true Sin...to satisfy a passionate heart that craves far more than freedom."
4,The Vixen finally finds her Match,"Another wonderful romance by Suzanne Enoch. In this story you will see some of your old friends (Lex and Lucien) along with Vixen who was introduced to us in the first book in this series, along with Mrs. Greenville's Academy.The story starts out as Vixen is drawn to ""Lord Sin's"" and dances with him, then allows him to take her to the garden and winds up in a very passionate kiss with most of London looking on.With a forced marriage that neither is apparently going to get out of they basically resign to being together but not giving up on their independence.Vixen is also one of the strongest woman characters in romance stories, she has a wonderful mind of her own. She even figures out Sin's past as well as who killed his brother long before anyone else believes her. I also loved her pets! The Mongo is a hoot!I really enjoyed this one."
2,Disappointing Vixen,"I love Suzanne Enoch's books and am anxiously awaiting the next in March - but ""Meet Me at Midnight"" was not only a disappointment but an annoyance beginning and ending with the heroine. The first time I read this book it was OK, the second read I threw it across the room, my own immature reaction to the childish, idiotic and uninteresting actions of Vixen. I am all for heroines that go against type - but this one didn't go in a way that made her more interesting, independent or engaging - instead I felt that I was wading through a mess of unappealing character traits that made me question the hero's sanity in liking her and rooting for someone else to appear and steal him away. Ms. Enoch is, however, still one of my favorite authors and I gave this book 2 stars simply because dispite my hatred of Vixen it was still well written structurally. I still recommend any of Ms. Enoch's other novels."
4,quite good,"This book is a very good example of the Tom Thumb/Stuart Little genre. Very original in its plot, and quite well written. Incidentally, Amazon, you should really have a subject category for ""miniatures"" in children's fiction, given that it is such a classic category, beloved by children. Fans of The Indian in the Cupboard or The Borrowers might appreciate being able to find more books about miniature people without a struggle."
4,Excellent Overview,"Excellent overview of not just a grassroots American phenomena, but a wonderful moment in time when television was local, before everything got sliced up and homogenized by the greedheads. Not everyone can be covered, and they do a nice job talking around the lack of Elvira, but this is a lot of fun. I especially liked the opening clip (it could have been Vampira, for chronology, or Zacherle, for popularity, or Svengoolie, for cult appeal, but I thought it was a nice choice that summed the whole thing up and gave it a humble face) and the title sequence, which is just grand! Good work. Now everyone go buy VIRGINIA CREEPERS on DVD!"
3,American Shorty,"Yes Being a Horror host Myself I was very excited to see this , It was done very well and professionaly but it left out so much, there was no mention of Bowman body or sammy Terry ect you would have to buy Virgina creepers to fill some of the gap this movie had, and then somebody needs to recognize people like sammy terry and Dr scar two of the best hosts ever, i give it 3 stars for at least getting this out there, People need to remember the good ol days. If your a horror host fan this is good but a little dissapointing as well but worth having."
3,Not really worth the wait,"The long, long wait for this release made unreal expectations for the quality. The nuts and bolts of the video and editing are just fine but the content is just not there. The focus is on modern hosts recalling past hosts instead of interviewing the pioneers directly. Oh there are some nice spots here and there but for $20 I expect quite a bit more.Good first effort but not great. Hopefully American Scary can serve as inspiration for more projects of this type."
3,American Scary - short on Hosts,"American Scary is the first documentary to spotlight the Horror Host phenomenon in America. The DVD is very professional and the filmmakers have done an admirable job of researching some of the original hosts from the early days of television, but what is really lacking is more footage of the horror hosts themselves. I grew up watching Pittsburgh's Chilly Billy Cardille back in the 1970's and while this host gets his due, he is only one of a limited number of hosts really given any airtime. We spend a lot of time watching a lot of ""interviews"" with ""fans"" of these icons from days-gone-by when what we really crave is more archival footage of these wonderful shows. By the end of this DVD I found myself feeling a little cheated and wanting for more horror hosts."
3,Just OK,If you gew up watching these hosts showing old movies on TV then this is enjoyable to watch once. I think it could have been expanded more considering how much can fit on a DVD. Major hosts like Zacherly and Elvira should have gotten more time and interviews.
2,something missing,Great movie well played out.How it cannot have the SON OF SVENGOOLIE is a reason not to buy the movie.Sven has been on for nearly 30 years and is loved in Chicago.
2,BUT WHERE IS...?,"sooo, a ""best of"" album thats missing lots of significant songs from the artists career. thats weird. not like ive ever seen that before.but seriously, why, if a record company doesnt have the funds/rights to get the artists complete collection together, do they waste their time and our money releasing it?"
2,"Among others, missing one of his biggest hits....","I found it very hard to believe that the people that put this ""greatest hits"" CD for Tevin Campbell left off several if not one of his biggest hits. The track I am referring to is ""Alone with You"" from the ""T.E.V.I.N. Campbell"" CD. Although many of his other great tracks are present, the fact that the above noted song is missing has deterred me from purchasing this album."
5,Tevin where have you been the voice of gold,"Tevin has the voice of gold, smooth with a passion that makes you kick back to Shh; but everyone what's to hear that sound. I look forward to hearing something in the near future of Tevin with the same quality as always. Whether it rains or shins that makes no difference there is something here for all that love good music. A fan in waiting..."
1,"Sucko, Sucko, Sucko!!!!","I hate the song, ""Tell Mw What You Want Me To Do"". That is the whinniest, suckiest song I've ever heard. When I was a child, I heard it, and they played it on the radio non-stop. Needless to say, that has scarred me from ever listening to the radio again, fear of that song coming on. He sucks, and I just wish he and his albums would disappear. That's what I want him to do!!!!"
4,substitue,I picked this rod to fill in while my split bambo rod is being repaired. Looking it over it seems alot for the money but using it will give an indication of it's value. It appears to be quality built and certaintly is a good looking rod.
5,simply great!,"This is the best stuff i have seen with these guys, going through different albums, having great fun on the stage and performing superbly. They picked their best songs for this concert - not that i could do that, i love every single song they made. Anyway it has this feel of a very intimate show with a small crowd of people. They are actually playing with the instruments while performing great music. You will not regret buying it. And SB deserves your buy :)"
5,Awesome DVD ! Great Musicians - Great Music !,"This band rocks , actually it progrocks !!True musicians in the days when you don't have to do something special to become famous.Great songs mostly from their latest CD but who cares.I love Neal Morse but Nick has a better voice.There is a kickass drum solo of both drummers.17 songs + 2 solos"
4,"Very good, but some of the remixes could have been better!","I'm a huuuge Aqua-fan, and I love all their songs, and I've always been wondering what they would sound like if they got remixed. Well, I got the answer by buying this CD. There are very many good remixes, but I miss the verse on very many songs. The Perky Park Club Mix of ""Barbie Girl"" is good, but where is the rest of the song? I can only hear the refrain! Some of the other remixes are like this too, but my favourite remix is the Metro Scuba Club Mix of ""Turn Back Time"". This fine ballad has been remixed into a catchy dance tune! The CD-ROM-videos are also very good. The ""Barbie Girl""-video is my favourite!"
2,THERE ARE BETTER BOOKS OUT THERE,"I thought that I would be getting a book targeted to the specific problems that shelter dogs experience. Perhaps training advice on how to deal with issues that these special dogs may exhibit. Boy - was I wrong! Having recently saved a 4 month old puppy from a shelter I was really looking forward to learning how to make my puppy's adjustment smooth. I learned nothing from this book. Some ridiculous chapters include ""Sex - Who Needs It"" and ""Will It Bite?"" both addressing issues that really don't need an entire chapter. Of course your dog should be neutered and of course you should do your best to choose a happy playmate - not an agressive fiend. I am not a new dog owner but these chapters would make me never want a dog. I have had a much better experience with other books written on the subject. I would not recommend this for anyone looking for insight and training tips for shelter dogs who may have been abused, abandoned, be extremely submissive or agressive."
4,(...)Reveiw of A Single Shard,"In 12th century Korea there is a orphan boy named Tree-ear. Ever since he was a baby he lived with a man named Crane-man under a bridge in the potter village Ch'ulp'o. Tree-ear admires one potter, Min. Tree-ear and Crane-man barely have any food or money until one day he went into Min's workplace and accidentally breaks a pot and most pay back Min by working for him but the potters wife starts to pay him with food. Tree-ear wants to learn how to make pots but Min refuses. But then he is sent on a journey to King's Court to show his master's pottery, but, little does he know this journey will change his life.This book is a good book. It starts out slow but when you start reading you really get into it. I like it because it is kind of a sad, slightly suspencing,adventerous, bed time story. People who would like adventure story with some thrilling and sad moments would love this book."
3,a Single Shard,"A single shard is a story about a poor boy named tree-ear who lives with a good friend, Cran-man. he helps a potter named Min make two beatiful vases. Then he set off on the journey to deliver the vases to the king.this book takes you back in time to a important part of history."
5,A Single Shard,"The twelfth-century Korean village of Ch'ulp'o is famous for its celadon pottery. Tree-ear, a young orphan, spends his days foraging for food on the fringes of society. The book opens with Tree-ear living under a bridge with Crane-man, a lame man who has cared for him most of his life. While foraging for food around the village, Tree-ear begins to watch Min, a master potter as he throws clay. Through his determination and desire to learn, Tree-ear apprentices himself to Min and begins the difficult task of satisfying the perfectionist, Min. Richly detailed, the book is a wonderful portrait of life in Korea and a tale of strength and determination. Tree-ear, in spite of his poverty and hunger, throws himself into learning with will and determination."
4,DIFFERENT,A predictable plotline with a satisfying conclusion. One slightly violent event spurs the main character on to action.
4,A Single Shard,"Having just traveled to South Korea, I have become fascinated with its ancient customs. The author writes a touching and sensitive story of class distinction in medieval Korea; and I also learned a lot about the making of quality ceramics, especially the coveted and lovely green celadon method."
3,"Good, but not Newbery material","The story is fine though predictable, and the book reads smoothly (Park makes clear writing look easy and creates some lovely lines). However, everyone I've heard compliment this book is an adult. The book's predominantly narrative style, its quiet tone, and its detailed passages about ceramics might be too subtle--or slow--for many children. I recommend the book for patient readers because the book IS good, but I puzzle over why it received the Newbery."
4,Excellent Book,"The book I read was A Single Shard by Linda Sue Park. This book was about a potter and a young boy named Tree-Ear. The potter was making pottery and trying to get a commission. Min, the potter, hired Tree-Ear to help him with certain jobs for him around the village. Tree-Ear lived with Crane-Man under a bridge. Crane-Man only had one leg that he could walk on. Min had a wife and one kid, but his kid died. Tree-Ear had been watching Min through a tiny hole in a shed. Once he saw him he knew he wanted to work for him. The setting of this story was in a small village on the west coast of Korea in the mid to late 12th century.A Single Shard was a tremendous book. I recommend this book to anyone of age 11 or above. This book was full of excitement and was impossible to stop reading. The author, Linda Sue Park, is an excellent writer and I would read all of her books. I think everybody should read A Single Shard."
1,boring,THIS BOOK WAS REALY BORING I REALY DIDINT LIKE IT BECOUSE OF IT WAS BASED OVER 700 YEARS AGO IF YOU LIKE STORYS BASED IN THE 12 CENTURY THEN YOU WILL PROBLY LIKE THIS BOOK BUT IF YOU DONT LIKE BOOKS LIKE THAT I SUGJEST YOU GET ANOTHER BOOK THAT BASED SOMEWHERE IN THIS TIME(...)
5,Beautiful Book,"""A Single Shard"" by Linda Sue Park is a beautifully written tale which offers fiction interspersed with history. Although I'm an adult, I enjoyed this book immensely. Congratulations to the author for winning the Newberry. Well-deserved."
5,Excellent book,"My 12 year old son loved this book. He was not enthusiastic about reading it, but ended up thinking that it was fantastic!"
3,5th Grade Students' Review,"This story was not the best at the beginning but it got a little better at the end. The characters were not the best choice for this book but, they did some interesting things.I think you should read it because the author expresses the feelings of the characters. It also expressed the details very well. This book would be great for a person who likes adventure stories. Though it was ok, if I had the chance to read it again, I wouldn't.We would give this book three out of five stars. We are advanced readers from the 5th grade and would recommend Number the Stars based upon our friends' review!"
4,"Loved it, but...","A single shard is a fantastic book full of dynamic characters and stunning descriptions. My only wish was that the author would have managed to slide some humor into the story. Overall, it was a fabulous read, and I look forward to seeing some more of Park's work."
4,MY SIXTH GRADE BOOK REPORT,"A Single Shard is an adventurous historical fiction that leads one boy's life to an adventure so great he will remember it forever. The boy's name is Tree-Ear and he is an orphan that lives with a man named Crane-Man. The village was Ch'ulp'o, Korea during the twelfth-century. He is barley surviving on scrapes of food under a bridge. He gets curious and accidentally breaks a potter named Min's pot. Then Tree-Ear has to work for Min for nine days. Later on after his work is finished he will work more, hoping to become a potter like Min. An emperor's assistant comes in hope of finding a great potter like Min. There is another potter who is just as great as Min and he is Kang. The theme is Tree-Ear trying to become a potter. The conflict is Tree-Ear's quest to become a potter. I liked this novel because it shows how live was in the twelfth-century at Korea. This is a great book for people who think History is a great genre."
4,Book Assignment,"Hi, I'm thirteen years old, and I read this book assigned to me by my teacher (required for eighth grade students in my school). At first I was like 'Ugh, not another book,' but when I started reading, I was hooked, and I finished the book before anyone else did.I really loved this book, and I think Linda Sue Park is an excellent author. Her writing really let me imagine a 12th century potter's village, and watching a boy spying on a potter working on his pottery. This is a really inspirational book that allows readers to always believe in their dreams, even though hope is dimming.I recommend this to teens my age level and above. Everyone who reads this will also enjoy learning new Korean words...I did."
5,A Triple Life,"A Boy who has no parents is sent on a mission by his master and then gets new parents. I have two favorite parts: those favorite parts are when the boy gets respect from the emissary, and when he gets the pottery master and his wife as his new mother and father. I would recommend this book to any one who likes books that start off with orphans and end up with the orphan having parents.RuDong, age 11, from Taiwan"
3,A good book w/ an abrupt ending,"A Single Shard was a good book and I liked it a whole lot! it was very interesting, and i liked the characters and plot. however, i did not like the end. it felt very abrupt, and i just didn't like it too much. it could have been better, and it could have had a little bit more suspense, but overall it was a good story! <3"
3,The shard Review by Evan Wheatley,"This book is called A Single Shard. This is a story about a boy named Tree ear that lives with a man named Crane Man. They live under a bridge in Korea. They try to live under the bridge by survivng on herbs and on special ocasions, delicous rice. It is a hard life for them both.This is a good book because it tells alot about old Korea. This would be a good book for those who like foriegn books. I hope you will enjoy this book. I cant thank you enough for reading this review. Good bye and have fun reading."
3,good,"A Single Shard is about a boy who loves pottery and gets a job working for a potter named Min.This book takes place in the early nineteen hundreds this boys name is Tree-Ear he lives with a man named Crane-Man under a bridge in china,Sarah"
4,"Not bad, but not GREAT","I keep these in my Jeep so when there is a vehicle in distress I can be of service by directing traffic. The reflective part is very nice, but the material the gloves are made of is more like a spandex. A cheap spandex. They just seemed a little too cheap for what you were paying. But it is a nice addition to the roadside assistance equipment in the Jeep.Visit my website at [...]"
4,Delightful,"I fell in love with Luc. It was so obvious that he loved her. Yes, he was a jerk at first but I totally supported every angry words that he told Catherine. She was so annoying and even hysterical at times. HE had already told her he loved her yet she kept thinking that she had no proof of his love and that he didn't love her.I have to say I liked her the best when she had lost her memory.If you don't mind annoying heroine go for it, even if you do give it a try. Luc will definitely make it worth your read."
2,Just Not That Good....,"I bought this one online based on the previous high reviews, but I've regretted buying it bcs. the heroine seemed to be such a wet doormat...."
4,Decent for standard size keys,"My mother, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, has these on her house-keys and they work really well. Unfortunately, the heads on her car keys are too large for the E-Z Key Turners.One solution I've found is to take an epoxy putty--like J-B Weld or QuikSteel, among others--and shape a new, larger, more ergo head around her slightly oversized keys. The epoxy putty molds like playdough but cures rock hard. The putty can be hand-shaped while still soft or, once cured, cut, drilled, filed, and/or sanded."
4,"Powerful, delightful, and brief","Remember the polyrhythmic big beat of Adam and the Ants? Here's the people they ripped off in a thirty-minute performance that blows the white sox off of Adam's boys. Strong, well-coordinated drumming punctuated with occasional yells is all you'll get and all you'll want from this ensemble. No background music, this commands your full attention as it guides you into a too-short trance. The Drummers of Burundi will change the way you hear music."
2,Very tiring,"I downloaded this CD from Itunes and I don't care for it at all. It is only one long track, and while the rhythms do change, they are hard to discern. After a few minutes it just becomes very repetitive for the listener.Instead of this, get Babatunde Olatunji's Drums of Passion.Drums of Passion"
2,30 minutes of monotonic pounding,"30 minutes of monotonic, monorhythmic pounding... and very poor recording quality to boot. There is $10 bucks I'll never see again. Oh well, you win some you lose some."
1,BB Chevy,Very poor BB Chevy book with very little useful information.Author needs to take a few tips from the likes of David Vizard on how to write an engine book.
1,not worth it,this book is all about builds allready made in magazines.....if you want something to show you tricks on big blocks go some wheres else ....not wort the money.
4,A big fan of the Shake Rattle & Roll franchise,"Even though this movie doesn't live up to its predecessors, especially the early ones, I still love the genre it brings. I have all the Shake, Rattle & Roll movies in DVD with an exception of the first one as I think they haven't made a DVD version of the first one at all. If you know that they are selling the DVD version of the original Shake, Rattle & Roll, please do let me know where to buy them."
2,12 inch spring pan,The pan was functional but so cheaply made it easliy bends out of shape. A cheaply made pan compared to the similar pans I bought at the grocery store. I bought this pan because I couldn't get a 12 inch anywhere else.
3,"Pleased with 12"" pan","I was pleased with the Hillware 12"" springform pan. True that it is an aluminum pan but it was functional and easy to clean.Didn't have a problem with it bending out of shape. White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake came out wonderfully. Used a double recipe and it was cooked all the way through."
3,Aluminum pan,I was a little disappointed in this pan. It was not what I thought it was. Represented as a commercial quality but it looks like something you could buy at any discount store.
3,"Initial impressions poor, but it works - see below","I have to be honest, I haven't used this pan yet, so I can't comment on its functionality. Just from appearances, however, it is very thin and not that sturdy. The ring doesn't form a tight fit around the base of the pan, so I'm a bit nervous that it will actually hold batter properly. Also, since I ordered this one online, I've found others in shops for half the price that seem to be much better quality. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Fake truffle flavor,"Sadly, this product uses the artificial flavoring* (listed as ""aromas"" in the ingredients list) that's used to make ""truffle oil"" products: once you've tasted it you'll never forget it. Look up ""fake truffle oil"" on the net and you'll learn more.I hate that fake flavor, to say the least. It's not as overpowering as it is in the truffle oil products, but it's there. We used the jar up as best we could and won't order again.*2,4-dithiapentane, I believe"
1,A MADAGASCAR RECORD IN THE TOP 50 GREEK MUSIC BESTSELLERS?,"Please, do you know were Madagascar is? (And Mauritius?) I wouldn't recommend anyone this record if they were looking for Greek music, as I was doing as I found it, together with other records from Madagascar, in the middle of the Greek music list. Apart from that, Justin Vali is a geat musician (I recommend his record with Kepa Junkera ""Bilbao 00:00"")"
4,An interesting view of early capitalism,The new introduction resumes the recent discussion about the book and the position of left wing critics of capitalism very well. The book shows new facts of the development of capitalism and state.
4,Great album!,This is another great album from TD lovers. And if you like TD you can check out a campaign on kickstarter for new music from a new comer to the electronic music world.[...]
2,Won't brake lugs,I've tried it on two different pickups and two trailers. The handles aren't long enough to break lugs. I tried it on lugs I put on by hand with rachet still would not break it loose
2,P.O.S Broke,"I picked one of these up because I drive a '98 Integra...and I figure the more space I can save the better seeing as how the Integra doesn't have much space. Well, it broke the same day I bought it...could only get 2 lugs off and then SNAP! ther went the wrench. Got 1 star for every lug it took off."
1,edited? pshaw!,"Has anyone ever bought an ""edited"" version of a CD? I've never ever seen one at a CD store, only here on Amazon. Who would want one anyways? Go buy the regular version of this album, it's awesome. Be sure to get the Canadian import though; the US version leaves out three songs --'I Miss New Wave', 'Let's Get It On' and 'Going All the Way -- and replaces them with three songs from the previous album, 'Underdogs' (available only in Canada). MGB is definately one of the best Canadian bands today, next to The Tea Party."
3,Fun movie but bad acting/directing,This is a great family flick but the acting/directing are sub-par. The special effects are decent considering this movie was made in the early 80's. Definitely worth seeing at least once...if you have kids who can watch it with you.
4,It transported me back to the 80's,"The 80's decade has a lot of great movies. Short circuit is one of them. Watching this movie again made me feel a little bit nostalgic about those years. About the DVD itself: you will get only the DVD and the case, don't expect a list of chapters, promotionals or anything additional. Also in the DVD there is not subtitles and no other languages (the description at Amazon indicates subtitles and Spanish language, but there is nothing of that). The DVD menu gives you this options: Start, scenes, languages (5.1 or 2.0, both of them in English)"
4,all generations,"I enjoyed this movie when I was young, so I purchased it so my children could enjoy it too. They absolutely love this movie. It had been awhile since I saw it, and I forgot how much I enjoyed it. Highly recommend for the family."
5,Short Circuit! A movie to charish!,"Ok, when i was a little kid i remember watchin this movie. I was like 5 or something, and since then i have looked and looked and looked, any finally i rented it once, then i really didnt have time to watch it, so i kept looking and looking, and the only place i could ever think of is somewhere online. So today i finally bought both of them! I just loved this movie the first time i saw it! Im 18 now, and im still thinking, i cant wait till those movies get to my door step! I would reccomend this movie to anybody, yes it may be a little Korny, but who cares! This is one of those movies you will charish for a lifetime!"
1,Very poor transfer from VHS,"I have the VHS tape of this movie, I really like it.I decided to buy the DVD version for better image quality andsome bonus features. But I found that the image quality is notbetter than VHS version. And there is absolutely no singlebonus feature. You can only choose, ""play main feature"".Even worse, it does not even have any caption or subtitle.At least the VHS had closed caption.This DVD is sort of ""just watch once and throw it to the garbage can""quality. If so, why don't you buy a better featured VHS ?"
1,Product does not fit description,"I haven't watched the movie yet, and my husband cannot enjoy it at all. He is DEAF, and it is supposed to have subtitles!It is in the Amazon product description, but not on the box or in the menu. I tried pressing the ""subtitle"" button on my remote, but the subtitles are not on the disk!"
2,Blu-ray version disappointing,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is fun, clever, action packed and makes you feel good. I was so excited when I saw there was a Blu-ray version - but what a disappointment. It isn't any better than a standard DVD - doesn't fill the width of my HD TV. I have looked at the specs on the case and can find no way to tell this BEFORE I buy. Any help here? Or did I get a bad disk? It would be most helpful to have this information available in the product description."
1,Great movie on bad DVD,"I have always loved this movie. No discussion possible.But... this DVD is about as bad as it gets: it is a FAKE wide-screen reproduction, meaning that on a wide-screen TV you get black bars all around the image. Yes, you can zoom in, using your TV's zoom function bad that means that are blowing up the pixels even further (already pixels are expanded to show regular DVDs on high-res screens, zooming makes it even worse.Anamorphic wide-screen has been available in the DVD definition from the get go. This technique gives best wide-screen reproduction on full-screen AND wide-screen TV sets."
1,short circut,"I ordered and the item was delivered to my door in lest than one week. GREAT Service.Although, I did order another item and have NOT received the movie and still my credit card was charged and have Not had a response from Amazon or the seller as to why and what the problem is. To which I have contacted three times. I will not shop here again."
3,Short Circuit,"This is a good movie, however, I expected more from a bluray version. Film quality is bad - it does not seem to have been post-processed at all to improve the image quality beyond the original film. Poor analog to digital transfer. If you own a DVD or even VCR version of this movie, don't bother repurchasing it."
4,a fond memory,This movie is really a cute movie. My kids loved seeing it and I remembered how much fun it was to see it at the movies. It is not the best movie I ever saw but it is not the worst either.
4,preview film before showing to children,"I had seen this film many years ago.I had forgotten how much ""questionable"" language and the one incidenceof inappropriate ""finger"" humor that there was.I would not show this film to children.What an enjoyable movie to be ruined by gratuitous PG13 language."
4,This Movie Rules!,"This movie is by far the ultimate classic 80's movie. It haspretty good effects, a good story line, and who can forget Ally Sheedy.... I recommend buying the movie. If you don't buy it for yourself, buy it for your kids."
4,Good DVD,This was an entertaining DVD on a robot who was part human. It was a good mix of technology and humanity and it was a good purchase.
2,Not really widescreen,"I really like this movie, but was disappointed with the DVD. It claims a widescreen aspect ratio, but it is actually a 4:3 presentation with black bars at the top and bottom which simulates widescreen. My TV can compensate for this somewhat but the producers of the DVD really missed the mark."
2,Way more foul language than I remember...,"I had fond memories of watching Short Circuit as a child, so I figured it would be OK to watch with my young sons.WOW I WAS WRONG...Now, if you don't mind foul language in front of your kids, then fire this movie right up. The story is still reasonably good and entertaining (even though seeing the electronics of the day is quite amusing). However, if you do mind bad language, let me tell you that it's chock full of bad language. My wife and I ended up turning the movie off because of the language. I really don't remember it being that bad. Maybe I watched an edited version when I was a kid.To make this review concise...If your value system allows for you kids to be exposed to a lot of bad language, by all means, watch the movie. It's fairly entertaining, even though it's old.If your value system DOESN'T condone this kind of language, I'd steer far away from this. There are many better options out there."
4,Short Circuit personal despite mechanical,"If ""Johnny Five"" has a personality, then he needs to fix my computer to be the same. After a robot is struck by lightning at the Nova Laboratories it becomes ""alive."" The robot then develops a personality to think that it is human. Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg star in this high-tech life story."
2,Liked it,"I loved the movie, I wanted to show it to my 4 year old son that loves walle. I didn't like that the features of the movie at the webpage informed that the movie came also in spanish spoken and subtitles, but it didn't."
2,"Except for a few quotes, it's really forgettable.","I honestly don't know why everyone likes this movie so much. Sure, it had some cute moments, but otherwise...eh. It's never kept my interest very long, and I can't even remember how the movie begins or ends. Everything about this film was just really plain.I do like how WALL-E looks like Johnny 5 though."
2,barely entertaining,"I was going to watch this with my six year old grand-daughter, but fortunately previewed it. I barely recall seeing the movie when it came out many years ago and didn't recall how bad it was. Not very entertaining and unnecessarily profane."
5,Way too funny,"I love this movie, The best part in here was when NUMBER_5 made a copy of himself and it got blown up."
4,Cheaper at Walmart and Unused,Received DVD in Like New condition and in only a few days after ordering but with S/H it would have been cheaper to buy New at Walmart.
4,Nice movie,A cute movie from the 80's...It has good image quality...remember those were analog times....
4,"Nostalgia and humor... Didn't age especially gracefully, though.","Bought it to relive a bit of my childhood. While it's still more-or-less funny, etc., it didn't age especially well. It very much ""looks"" like an 80's film (the hair, clothes and the special effects) and sounds like an 80's movie (dialogue, music, etc.).But, it's still rather entertaining! Has a few special features decent picture quality, considering the source material. I think it's mainly good for the nostalgia value..."
4,Short Circuit,Great movie to view with your Grand kids enough action to keep them intrested and enough subtile humor to keep you from snoring. If your kids are sensitive to violence then I would skip the opening scene as it does simulate a combat scene.
2,Bellow the average,The film subject is not either for adults nor for kids. The main proposal is week for a scientific fiction movie: a robot that becomes alive. From the point of view of my kids the film is just regular. One of my kids is ten and the other seven years old.Fernando Fernandes
3,parents beware,"My family would list this as one of their favorite movies. However, we had a TV-version of the story - and didn't realize it had so many ""bad"" words. The language is just not necessary to the plot of the story. Recently I bought a professionally made copy, to avoid all the commercials that came with the old TV-taped version...boy was I surprised! 45 ""bad words""! This is a kids story, why did it have to have so much foul language?! It wasn't just a word here and there, it was 45 bad words!"
1,Displeased,"BEWARE! I purchased this item for my 6 and 3 yr. old grandchildren only to be shocked when I heard all the foul language. Rated PG, it should be PG 13. Will become a yardsale item or else go in the garbage."
3,Purchased in a fit of 80s nostalgia,"I'd feel better about this purchase if I'd gotten it in the bargain bin. I'm saddened that I paid around $10 for it. What was the appeal of Ally Sheedy? Seriously. I don't get it. I really only bought this because of a vague memory of seeing it at a drive-in on the 4th of July when I was a kid. It's not the worst purchase ever made but, it's really not one I'm proud of."
1,Short (on captions) Circuit,"This is not a review of the blu-ray version. I am afraid to spend money on it since it appears to have the same major failing as the DVD version (which I do have)--NO CAPTIONS. I assume that captions are not too costly or difficult since every DVD I own has them. There are several reasons why captions are helpful which I won't labor over, but I think every blu-ray should have captions and a wealth of other extras. My blu-ray player uploads my DVD's so well that I see no reason to upgrade my collection from DVDs to blu-rays unless there is offered something beyond what the DVDs have. FUN MOVIE--worthy of more stars, but blu-ray without captions is unacceptable."
4,Nice movie - some bad language,"I remembered watching this movie as a child, so when I noticed it at our video store and it was PG I checked it out. My 7 year old son enjoyed it very much - watched it two days in a row. My only qualifer is that for a PG movie, it had more bad language than I would like - and certainly more than I like my son to hear."
3,Letterboxed 2004 edition,"4 stars movie. 2 stars letter boxed. I bought this to replace my earlier edition to have it play 16:9 on load but it is still letterboxed. Image doesn't want to spend the money to give us an enhanced remastered DVD but they will change the cover to trick us. True, not a masterpiece but fun to watch. 5.1 sound and letterboxed, Incongruous."
2,Digital Download is poor quality,"You get what you pay for. Short Circuit was $7 to buy vs $3 to rent, so I paid the extra $4 to have in my Amazon library. Other movies I have ordered have been excellent quality. This one is very low resolution and not full-size. Even when I zoomed on my TV, it did not fill the screen. My 6 year old son liked the movie anyway, but my wife and I mostly cringed at the mediocre script and incredibly dated music and hair styles. The language was very crude for a family movie. No f-bombs, but lots of shxx, axx, damn and hells. The movie is a light PG but the language alone pushes it into R territory."
4,Good 80s Experience,"This was purchased for an 11-yr-old -- I was feeling wistful and reminiscing on some of the movies I'd watched in my childhood and decided to expose my children to some of them -- good, clean fun in this movie, and the kids (aged 3-11) burst out laughing on more than one occasion. Definitely an enjoyable experience for our family."
5,Beloved classic,"This is one of the best romance/comedy movies of all time. Johnie-5 shows us that technology can have a cute, human side. Aside from a little inuendo and language, this movie appeals to all ages. Short Circuit sets the standard for the genra. Look closely at Disney's latest ""Wall-E"" and you will notice a striking resemblance to 5."
3,When AI was new...,"In the late 80's we thought Robots were the answer.In the 2000'sthey are replacing grocery checkers, and still as stupid as ever?Five never was alive, except in the movies.But it makes a good story. Now they are making war robotsthat are getting better at killing.There are a Mac based robots traveling around Mars, too.I like the movie, now, as I did the first time I saw it,but I know that an 386 level just couldn't be intelligent!A new 4 ghz Intel with multiprocessors hasn't a chance either,but the 7000 networked Cern processors are much closer,but no AI, yet...."
3,Suitable for Kids!,"Good movie, but not my type. This is a science fiction, happy going, sometimes touching movie for the youngsters. The acting is not serious and the robots are not as dangerous as they are supposed to be.My type is the Terminator, a science fiction movie with terrifying robots from the future and a lot of serious action. Although kids these days will prefer these types of movies."
5,Fun movie,"Fun robot movie, first of two in the series. Some PG suggested for a few words and hand gestures. A lot of laughs for adults as well as children.Very overlook movie, it deserved more of an audience."
4,"I enjoyed it, BUT . . .","I enjoyed watching ""Short Circuit"", but I doubt if it is for everyone. Because of the premise that this is about an 'escaped' combat robot and because of some disturbingly milartaristic moments and questionable language, I doubt if anyone under age 17 should watch this thing. It is a decent comedy film with a science fiction based plot, but ... Also, one of the main characters is an asian Indian, who is stereotypical in many ways. Unfortunately, he is one of the focal points of the comedy, which does have some racial ignorance.I admit to sitting through it and enjoying the movie. Also, I am giving it a good rating. But ... (Please do notice that those 'but's do add up to a sort of question mark.) Do prescreen this movie for children under 17. However, I think college age kids will enjoy this movie. Older SF fans will, also, enjoy this movie."
4,I love Number 5. DVD format is UDF,"The DVD's picture quality is OK, viewable. You cannot expect much if it's about 25 years old. But be careful, it will not play on Mac or Linux automatically. Installation of additional software or packages on Linux is painful and very often it does not work. It is a proprietary format that plays only on Windows PC's."
4,"Old movie, I just like it","I like this movie. I don't really know what to say after that. It's an old movie, one I liked and wanted to own, and since I needed extra $ for my regular order to have free shipping, I ordered it. I mean, why pay extra shipping charges when you can have something for your money? It's like getting something for free. Period. Jim."
4,SUCH A CUTE MOVIE.,My son and I love silly movies from the 80's. This is a must for any collection. My 12 yo loves it.
3,does the job...,I liked this when I was a kid... but I saw it so many damn times! I'm sick of it now... but go ahead and try it!
3,A collection must have...,"This movie is for the whole family to watch, especially the children will love it."
2,Too much profanity for a comedy!,"While the basic plot is fine and the robot is charming, the acting is weak and the addition of sexual jokes and swear words does nothing to enhance the movie. Skip this one and jump to Short Circuit 2, which is a much more entertaining movie, and the acting is better too."
1,wrong product information,The product does NOT come with Spanish audio as is stated in the product description this may render it useless for some people.
1,NO closed captioning!!,"It claims it have closed captioning, in fact it DOES NOT, and therefore I have to give it a bad review because no captioning, and it's misleading to say it does."
1,Short Circuit - NOT subtitled!,"I specifically ordered/purchased this movie because the 'format' stated it IS ""subtitled.""See Amazon description: Format: Color, Dolby, Widescreen, SubtitledWell it is NOT subtitled and I would not of wasted my dollars for this DVD. No matter what I did it kept coming up ""not available."" ggggrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good buy!,"This is an especially good young person's movie. It's an engaging, fun, and entertaining way to involve children in the basic philosophical issue of ontology. Ontology is the study of what it means to exist, or in the case of ""Short Circuit,"" what it means to be alive. Note René Descarte's (1596-1650) famous statement in Latin, ""Cogito, ergo sum."" (I think, therefore I am.)Regarding the Blu-ray transfer quality controversy, the version I just bought, in Feb. of 2009, had a sticker on its wrapper that says, ""New Hi-Def Transfer."" Although this movie's video quality is not as good as ""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Fountain,"" or ""Ice Age: The Meltdown;"" ""Short Circuit"" strikes me as being close to average for Blu-ray. One complicating factor is that much of ""Short Circuit"" was shot with low contrast, so inherently, its sharpness seems somewhat low."
3,Its all about the 80s,"At the time this movie was released I was 8 years old and I really enjoyed the film. Feeling a little nostalgia I bought the blu-ray version and boy was I disappointed , not by the movie, but the quality of the Blu-ray. This Blu-ray version is 1 notch above VHS quality and thats even debatable. The scene outside with the fog is were you can really see the lack of quality in this movie."
4,Cute movie,"This movie is from the mid eighties and it shows.... I had the same haircut (as Ally Sheedy) back then. And those fashions.... Yikes! Brings back all sorts of memories.Anyway, this is a cute movie and I would consider it a good family movie. It is appropriate for kids of all ages."
4,Kids love it,Watched it when I was a kid now we picked it up for our older ones. They think it's funny!
2,Wasn't Impressed,"I bought this album on the basis of some of the reviews on this site, and I wasn't impressed. I expected the album to be catchy with lots of riffing and melody and enjoyable hooks --like the song ""Disease."" Unfortunately ""Disease"" and ""Why Am I Here?"" are the only ones that are like that. The rest wasn't as good, more like Creed or something. Ugh."
4,Revolation for the Hell of it.,This was the first writings of Hoffman I had ever read. It rewrites history and covers things I had never been expossed to. It is a dark book with energy and spunk. It reflects the things we are going through now with the same type of goverment tricks. We must take back of country from the frat boys who are running it into the ground.
3,Abbie is a naive punce who no one remembers,"Abbie knew what he was fighting against ... but I don't think he had a clue about what he was fighting for.I admire anyone willing to get in the ring so to speak... But anyone who's hero is Fidel Castro and also believes in ""individual freedom"" needs to have his head examined.Abby thought that freedom is the freedom for the ego to move through life without obstruction. Needless to say, this is a child's view of freedom.He never understood that in life one must learn reckon with sail, wind and tide ... and freedom is only found when one learns to do that.Abbie merely spit into the wind... and got angry when it ""had the audacity"" to blow back on him.If he had lived longer, perhaps he would have learned to pick and choose his fights with a little more discrimination."
4,a really enjoyable and informative read,"Terry has managed to combine interesting historical information, well developed characters and a endlessly innovative storyline in a highly enjoyable mix. The book filled with wonderful twists and turns as well as well researched information. Terry is at his best (and it is really pretty good) when he lets the story and the characters move things along and goes slow on the historical minucea. It is a story that leaves the reader ready for round two after they catch their breath."
1,Not worth your time,"It's rare that I really don't like a book, but this didn't deliver what it promised. Contrary to other reader's comments, there's very little character development, and the character's emotions and reactions don't really seem to fit the context of the situation.I became uninterested in the rather rambling plot, and didn't find the situations very believable. A must miss.I would definitely recommend Conn Iggulden's Emporer or Khan series, and I really love Wilbur Smith's Courtney or Ballentine series. Both these authors really develop their stories, have strong plots, and do a great job of weaving history into a story."
5,WOWSER!,"This kept me going until the very end! Awesome story, a great read and a grand plot. The first time I've read this author and I can't wait to read more!"
2,Good American Thriller,"This is a very good American cops-and-robbers thriller. All the characters are Americans, in speech, action, thinking. The odd Italian word, & the odd Britishism are thrown in, Hollywood-style, for atmosphere. Venice is only an exotic backdrop. Tammany Hall in Hollywood-Venetian garb is what passes for Venetian politics. Very good entertainment."
1,Disappointing,I was disappointed in this book. The characters are one dimensional (there's little to care about here) and the plot is laborious.
1,plus size hosiery,it is listed as queen 2 which is fine til you get to the lace top with is too tight and does not give. Tried cutting into but still didn't help..only help would be to reduce yourself or buy from another company..which i have.
5,Great,"All right, let's get right down to it! When it comes down to intimate apparel, there is nothing that captures a man's eyes and imagination as thigh-high stockings!These soft and sexy stockings wear well, and stay up. So, you don't need to use a garter, but I do recommend one. (I don't believe in understatement in the bedroom.)I highly recommend these stockings to you - or for you men, buy them as a gift!(Review of Berkshire Thigh High Hosiery)"
1,Another vendor with Berkshire knee-high hosery. No better.,"As with the other Berkshire knee-high hosery I ordered, I was not the least bit happy with these. They were easily ""damaged."" They did not hug the leg, but sagged. They were not nice at all. I'm surprized a company like Berkshire would put out such an inferior product. They were not exactly ""cheap"" in price either."
3,YUMMY!!!,"I purchased these to make the well-known Coeur a la Creme recipe which is on the Food Network website and in Ina Garten's cookbook ""Barefoot in Paris"" (available on Amazon). I made half the recipe and filled 4 of these 4"" hearts to the brim (lined with cheesecloth) and put the remainder into a bowl. After several hours of refrigeration, the creme in the heart dishes hadn't oozed out of the holes, and except for being molded into a heart shape, it tasted and had a texture just the same as the portion I spooned out of the bowl. The half-recipe would easily fill 6 of these dishes for a reasonable serving size of this very rich dessert, however these dishes are not necessary for success. Even the heart shape gets lost under the berry topping. The recipe, however, is not to be missed! Unbelievably Yummy!"
5,Perfect for small dog crate,"This is perfect for my Pug's crate, it attaches to the side and she doesn't knock it down. The bowl comes out of the holder to wash and refill, and it's just the right size. Very happy with it."
2,Incorrect size,"I ordered the 11-1/2 inch Le Creuset Stoneware baking dish, and when I received it, the dish is only 10-1/2 inches and says so on the label. Not happy."
2,No CD-ROM,The book without the CD-ROM that was supposed to be included. The book was fine. I was just missing the CD-ROM.
5,Why buy Pt. 1 or Pt. 2 when you can have it all on Pt. 3?,"This is a cool little 3"" CD....I never seen one before, but it shore is cute! Oh, and the songs are good, too! ""Deadwood"" shoulda been on Version 2.0, it's pretty good....and ""Afterglow"" sounds like some kind of James Bond movie theme....it's ""tha shiz-nit""! Crystal method remix is alright, but the Purity remix is supa-dope! You should be ashamed of yourself for missing out on some badass music if you don't buy this one."
3,The first half is a bit of drag,"My dad rented this for me because I'm a huge Beatle fan. Seeing how casual fans disliked it for having to much info, I thought I might learn something from it. Well the first half is a photographer talking about how he just happened to have a camera on the day he met the Beatles and how he went around London taking pictures of them. The second half looked like it was going to show me the places where the Fab Four played, but still mainly an old man talking about his experiences. I think that it could have been better if they talked more about the Beatles' experiences than 2 guys that I've never heard of."
5,Robert Helms and Russell Gray Know Their Stuff!,"I have read many real estate investing books over the years and I must say, ""Equity Happens"" is the best one I have ever read! This book offers real-world strategies and tactics as well as how to ""think"" your way to becoming a successful real estate investor. Need a book on real estate investing? I would recommend ""Equity Happens"" be the very first book you read as it will lay the foundation for success!"
4,Less Messy Than Regular Bar Soap. Fun To Use,"The idea for a foaming soap is to reduce the time it takes for washing your hands. Instead of trying to work on a lather, a foaming soap is already made up of soap suds. Foaming liquid soap is generally thinner and watery, or else it will clog the mechanism to produce suds. You can buy refills in bigger containers or (shhhh..) concoct your own by mixing water and you favorite liquid soaps.Dial makes a lot of foaming soap products including Tone. A 7.5 oz bottle lasts a long time. More convenient than a regular soap for your powder room and sinks. It is also less messy than regular soaps. Generally one pump is enough to cover both hands. Just make sure that you cup your hands by the nozzle or the soap will spurt across the room. One wrong pump is all that it takes to learn how to use a foaming soap dispenser."
5,Prescribed by vet,This product was prescribed for excessive ear wax by my cat's veterinarian. It costs a little less to buy it over the internet.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Groo has a few problems with speaking, let alone having the skills to enable reading comprehension. A library? You jest. More stories here, including one where Rufferto is daydreaming, and you see how he would like things to be.Of course, they aren't, and he has to get Groo out of trouble yet again. All the usual suspects are here, the Sage, Arcadio, etc."
1,Psy Counter-Spy,"The book I received is missing forty pages (from 40 t0 79). I allreaday communicate this and the answer was that I return the book to be refunded.Quite frankly I want a book with all the pages, not the money of the book.Apart from the trouble of returnig the book I do not understamd what use are you doing to the book without forty (40) pages"
4,Good impressionistic jazz,"Jazz Meets the Bossa Nova is terrific stuff, perhaps Winter's best. It's companion album on this disk, Jazz Meets Folk Song, is less so, at times more pop than jazz. But the disk is worth it for the terrific ""Bossa Nova"" cuts."
5,Dyne supplement is amazing,"This supplement works great. All my dogs and puppies love the taste, it helped me put weight back on my nursing females in half the time. My male dogs kept their wonderful shape even during breeding season when eating is not their first priority."
2,I Really the Title Track..............,"......""Their System Doesn't Work For You"" is a good song. Pretty much every other song on here is garbage. Don't buy it."
4,"9/19 songs is good, but Anti-Flag has better","I have been listening to punk music, and especially Anti-Flag, for a while now, and have formed a reasonable basis for opinion on their Cds, having owned and listened to them all. The first 9 tracks from this Cd come from the North America Sucks EP, and are very good; easily up to par with Die For Your Government, and A New Kind of Army. However, then we come to the second 10 songs on the Cd, which are a swift change of pace, and not for the better. The sound quality is much worse, as are the songs themselves, including the singing. Although I love Anti-Flag in general and 9/19 of this Cd, I recommend it only if you've already listened to Anti's other stuff, liked it, and can't get your hands on the rare North America Sucks EP."
3,starts off good..then sinks like a stone,"What happened here? I popped this album in after years of searching for it ( it's extremely hard to find) and was blown away for the first 9 songs..then the album gets terrible..and I MEAN TERRIBLE..for the first 9 tracks their isnt one bad song , it's great punk ..but then from 10 and down each one is terrible , terrible , and terrible with maybe the two exceptions of ""Betty Sue Is Dead"" and "" Too Late"". 3 stars is really too much for this release considering how great ""Die For Your Government"" and ""New Kind Of Army"" were , but the first 9 are excellent punk songs the standouts being ""Their System Doesnt Work For You"" , ""Got His Gun"" , ""Born To Die"" and ""20 Years Of Hell""...better off without this one if you already own the North America Sucks EP which I doubt because only 1,000 copies were pressed but the tracks after #9 are really dumb , and long , boring , and just lame."
5,one of the greatest,"anti-flag had always been a favourtite of mine and this is definatly the best album ive heard in a long time!a mix of north america sucks and 9 newly released.dont waste ur money on sum other rip off bands. if u dont have this album go buy it now! definatly should be in ur punk cd collection!i recommend tracks 1,2,3,8,9,11,12,13,14,,15,18just some of the amazing songs anti flags put out."
5,beautiful,"just one thing i have to mention... it was like a gay flashback of ""bridges over madison county"" without the bridges :) but it was good and I'd watch it again"
3,Watchable,"Redwoods has a gripping storyline that reminds me of the memorable movie ""The Bridges of Madison County"". There is some good acting from the main actors, but some of the other characters have weak scripts resulting in an average movie."
3,genuion and true,"It is a great story but I found myself thinking are these straight actors TRYING to play gay charactors or are these gay actors TRYING to act. Sorry, I just just didn't feel they had the emotion they should have had giving the story line. In ""Torch Song Trilogy"" Harvey Fienstien had a line I love you, Just not enough. I came away from this movie feeling the same. I love the story but because of the acting, the movie Just not enough. I will continue to look for gay romance in the movies. I hope the directors will find actors who can be genuion and ture to what is written by the writers."
1,lousy movie,"This movie could have been better, lousy acting from the 2 main actors,the setting was beautiful, as the Northern Calif redwoods are lovely.Watch the movie, but you have been warned, sorry just telling the truth,"
2,From beginning has a problem - Desde el inicio comenzamos mal,"Resulta que desde el inicio tienen disonancias para aquellos que buscan historias de amor, porque comienza con un hogar gay fragmentado, donde una relación de siete años se ve en peligro por este nuevo romance que no es más que una infidelidad oculta por todos los cómplices familiares desde sus amigos, hasta su madre y hermano. Eso no entona con la búsqueda de un amor, si no con el problema de la infidelidad que se deriva de un desamor.No la recomiendo, excepto para aquellos que quieran salir corriendo de sus relaciones actuales. Y quieran ser infieles.No digo que esté mal, pero tampoco es congruente con una historia sincera de sentimientos.Since beginning showed how broke a solid relationship between two men, how separate a couple with a new option... I don't recommend this film except for the people who want to change their love for a new man."
1,Sappy doesn't begin to describe it.,"The romantic storyline and beautiful background of the California redwoods attracted us to this movie. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. The 81 minutes dragged on forever thanks to the slow (literally) dialogue and tremendous overuse of dramatic pauses. Every character seemed to have to think about every word for 30 seconds before saying it. Maybe they were trying to keep from laughing. The acting was not at all engaging or convincing and it wasn't helped by a script that could have been performed in more like 30 minutes. The story had many false starts - hints of subplots that were never developed. Overall, it seemed like it was written a gushing high school boy just out of the closet and bursting with hormone-laden false romanticism. But at least they had nice bodies."
1,I like trees,"I'm giving this film one star because I like trees, the movie however was painful to sit through (even the full frontal seemed gratuitous), the story was stale, the majority of the acting was unbelievably bad and frankly I was a bit saddened with the whole affair. I will say that I thought Matthew Montgomery was believable and did a commendable acting job (I would be interested in seeing another performance from him). This film just bothered me..."
2,Borning !!!,"I was kind of excited to watch this movie because of the reviews I was reading on the movie, but once I got the movie and watched it, it honestly sucked !!, couldn't get into the story, plus I didn't like the ending, I wish it had a nice ending but I guess not all movies end good."
4,Redwoods is underated,"This movie was very moving. While some people picked it apart, I enjoyed the journey. If you want to check to see if you're emotions are still working watch this movie."
3,OK movie with some problems,"This movie could be described as the gay version of ""Bridges of Madison County."" This movie is decent overall, but I definitely would rent it instead of buying it. I think Matthew Montgomery did some of his best work in this film, but I enjoyed ""Gone But Not Forgotten"" much more. I felt like the movie needed to be fleshed out a lot more. I found myself wanting to know more about Everett's partner and son. I wanted to know more about where Chase and Everett's lives took them over the last five years of the movie. The writer seemed to take a 'less is more' approach to this film, but I'm not sure that was the best choice here. This was a good movie that could have been excellent if tweaked a little."
2,Amateurish,"Redwoods(DVD)movie was skimpy on production values, story interest, and believable characters. The film pretended to be a romantic love story but our movie night audience was pleading for the dullness to end. Not even close to ""Big Eden's"" off beat humor, surprise twist, and touching love story that delivered the romance."
2,Really wanted to like this movie....,"Saw the trailers for this and thought, huh time to read amamzon reviews on it. I bought it anyway knowing there are very few good gay movies out there. Long painfully disjointed script, two dimensional characters and bradleys wardrobe kept screaming ""1985 lives again !""."
4,Redwoods,"I thought the movie was very well acted, the stars seemed believable, as did the plot. I felt very touched by the story line. The actors were very good. Over all quite an enjoyable, non sensational film.Ron Dean"
5,good purchase,this product arrived very quickly and packaged very well. it was just as advertised. good vendor to do business with thank you tz
3,Dreadwoods,"Definitely interesting is this film, with just the touch of romanticism you would love to encounter in your (too) casual life, if you're a bit of a dreamer. Just let me know why, most of the times, there's a melodramatic ending to most of the gay fiction on the scene?!! If it's just a way of paying the ""price"" for ""adultery"", it weakens the whole thing by its lack of opening, which should not be necessary ""happy"" though ; but a little uncertainty would have been welcome. That would have given an other dimension to the story. You'll enjoy it nevertheless."
3,Poco argumento,"Emma narra la historia de una joven impulsiva y consentida cuyo principal objetivo es encontrar el marido perfecto y no solo para ella sino tambien para su amiga Harriet, una chica de origenes humildes. A tal fin, Emma Woodhouse se empeña en manipular a todos los que la rodean, pero, naturalmente no para de equivocarse y provocar enredos y situaciones embarazosas. Solo Mr. Knightley, diecisiete años mayor que ella y hombre de temple y aplomo aprobados, se atreve a reprocharle su comportamiento de niña mimada e insensata...Una novela un poco aburrida, frivola y sin demasiado argumento"
1,Princess Vavara Softa Does Russia,"Imagine my dismay when I received this book and discovered that, far from being the memoirs of any actual Russian princess, it is nothing less than the graphic fictional account of the sexual escapades of a nymphomaniac Russian princess set during the time of the Emperor Paul. The author, anonymous, in describing with completely unwelcome detail the many exploits of this sex-crazed maniac, laces the book with erroneous bits of information about Catherine the Great's court and adds fascinating, made-up Russian phrases that sent me springing for my Russian-English dictionary every time (I got wise after a few chapters). In actuality, this book is a smut book, with no redeeming literary value whatsoever. It is the only book I have ever thrown away in my entire life."
3,"Great sword, wrong sheath","The sword is perfect. Well balanced, well made and very sharp. The sheath...it's all wrong. It's made out of black cordura nylon. Not very Spartan looking. It should have the leather sheath for that authentic look and feel. So now I'm on the hunt for a leather sheath. The black nylon one just won't do. Looks wrong and feels wrong."
3,Nice posters. A little dull,"I received the posters in record time and they even made it before xmas (even though I didn't need them til the next week). They are nice overall but 2 complaints... 1) the color seemed a little dull and 2) they were 23"" wide when most of the poster frames I found were only 22"" wide. But they are printed on very thick photo type paper and seem to be good quality otherwise."
3,In a galaxy far far away......,"Alright so I am dating a space fanatic, and for christmas I wanted to get him some nice framed photos of real telescopic shots. I didn't realize that there would be words along the bottom, as they are not pictured here on-line. Felt a little bamboozled. Now with that being said the quality of the picture is very nice, printed on thick poster paper and the colors are true and clear. I framed and matted the picture hiding the words, but even then wish they weren't there. Good product, definately not worth 15 bucks, but what the boyfriend wants he gets!!!Cheers!"
2,Not a book but a collection of manuscripts,"This book is moderately useful. It neither addresses basic imaging questions at a level that would catch the interst of a curious student, nor does it provide more comprehensive and thorough information for the seasoned clinician researcher. The chapters, mostly written by different authors, are rather randomly assembled, vary in quality, and leave the reader puzzled as to the overarching purpose of the book. And, it is very expensive for what it offers."
2,Not too Impressed,"I bought this for my dad's Glock 20, and it fit alright and it even looked nice. But when we tried to sight it at the range we were disappointed. Maybe I just got a bad one, but we would turn the dials to adjust it side to side or up and down but it wouldn't move. We got tight groups, but not on the target and that sort of defeats the purpose."
5,An Oasis for the Mind,"Oasis was released in 1997 as a soundtrack to a Mojave Desert film. What a superb instrumental/electronic album, a suprise really, even for a long-time Tangerine Dream fan like myself. The compilation is the work of the father-son team of Edgar and Jerome Froese. If you are looking for something representative of what Tangerine Dream is capable of in the way of an image-evoking, kick-back, mellow feeling soundtrack, Oasis is your best bet. Highly recommended as atmosphere, ambient, music and background tunes."
3,A good introduction to vip protection,"This book gives a good introduction to the world of Vip protection. It mainly centers on the United Kingdom and the United States, but does touch on a few other countries. More detail on the other countries would have made it an excellent book. For the reader who is looking for specifics on how to conduct Vip protection, this book does not provide that. It gives a history of how the industry has evolved and the types of problems faced. It is written in a style which makes for enjoyable reading."
1,A Movie to Avoid,"This is a true story of a man who struggles and eventually comes to grips with his alcoholism. It almost has the look of a home movie. Sound quality is poor, and cinematography could be better. The story itself is excellent, but the ending is a little bit over the top. If you are going to show this to a church group, it might be ok. Otherwise, there are hundreds of better movies out there."
2,Christian recruitment film.,"Michael Madsen plays Cecil Moe: husband, father, alcoholic. When his wife finally decides to leave him and take the kids with her, he calls Reverend Baird (who is played by the real-life Cecil Moe) and asks his advice.The low budget and sometimes unintentionally funny script is somewhat redeemed by a good performance by Michael Madsen, but in the end, the movie is too blatantly preachy. This movie is, according to the blurb on the back on the DVD, an ""inspirational drama"". This means ""Christian drama"". It was directed by Edward T. McDougal, who has made several christian films. They are what some christians would call ""witnessing tools"", but they really do mostly preach to the choir. If you like that type of movies, go ahead, but otherwise don't bother, unless you're a die hard Michael Madsen fan.The picture quality on the Westlake DVD is bad and not worthy of a full price DVD."
4,ammo pouch,"works well for my 410 ammo, i run a cattle ranch and needed a way to keep extra shots on hand, this does the job well"
1,Pouch's latch broke off after 2 hours of use,"Got this pouch for paintball in the Bay Area. Attached it to my molle vest the night before. Started play at 12:30PM the following day. By 2:30ish PM, latch needed for grommet had detached. I guess it wasn't meant for repeated openings and closings before and after games. The pouch, received the night before, was rendered useless as a result. Since it is a metal latch, it is definitely not worth it to have it repaired. Stay away from this POS...Stay far away."
5,A Gotta Have Pouch,"Better than a fanny pack. It's smaller, flatter, and rides great on the side of your waist. Can use it for much more than ammo! Carried my tactical flashlight, wallet, phone,small digital camera, and a tin of tobacco no problem. It's not bulky and is priced right. May try to waterproof it as its canvas and that would make it perfect.."
3,Quality control could be improved,"Alright, so I opened the package today to find two Rothco quality items(you should know about this hah). they both have different ""made in India"" tags on them, one of the belt loops is about half an inch higher on one, one already has a few runs in the canvas, one is slightly discolored on a portion of it. Other than those, which could be solved through some minor changes in quality control, this product seems to be quite the steal for a ""tactical"" utility pouch for maps, Magazines/clips, sandwiches, pocket tools etc etc.Three stars for quality control"
5,excellent reference,this is a very informative book. it includes articles that give an informative idea about feminism. it is worth every penny i paid. i recommend it for anyone interested in feminist studies.
4,Angela's Ashes Review,"I received the DVD exactly as the seller promised. It was in good shape and played well. The cover also looked good. It was worth the money spent. I purchased two copies of the Angela's Ashes DVD to show to students in my literature classes. They enjoy watching the movie along with reading the book. The DVD's came quickly after purchase. Overall, I was satisfied with the quality of my purchases."
5,Brilliant Photography,"The film was somewhat anti English but all the same I thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting, especially by the children was wonderful but above all the photography was brilliant. I'll be watching this again..........and again!!!!!"
4,Disappointing After Reading the Book,"I picked this DVD up the second day after finishing Frank McCourt's Book by the same name, I was quite disappointed. As is the Usual Case the Movie was not to be compared to the book.I found the book much more emotional than the movie.However it does offer the look of Ireland at that period in timeand some of the happenings in the book, so I think it's definitely worth watching,...but read the book afterwards ! You won't be disappointed.Recommended !!"
3,A Good Movie,This movie was indeed a great movie. The depiction of little Franky McCourt was great. The flick managed to pull through and follow the book at a whim but not by much. Key events and scenes are taken place but I think it lacks the true emotion of Francis McCourts story. Bottom line is READ THE BOOK.
2,Nothing like the book,"This movie was a good idea, but poorly done. It feels like watching a drawn-out chiche. The book was fantastic; dark and light at the same time, eerie and beautiful... the movie just doesn't do the book justice. I was highly disappointed."
2,Not bittersweet just bitter,"The original book had humour and pathos, good comedy is often tragic don't you think?This movie lacked humour and was just plain dreary. It also moved at such a pace that the characters remained two dimensional caricatures rather than envoking any sympathy in the audience. Perhaps it would have been better to allude to some of the events in the book and spend more time on specific key events."
2,Not Much Drama,"Crudely realistic. More like a documentary save and except the portrayal of his romance which is quite nice. But then that episode was too brief. The drama was lacking and it was more like an autobiography.Life is purgatorial in Ireland by that time. It reminds me of Mahler and of Rachmaninoff who had so many of their brothers and sisters and beloved passing away either so young or in their infantile. In short, it's like Dickens without his drama."
1,Morbidly Depressing,"This movie just drags. The struggle between the characters and their desires is noble and just, but the movie is just morbidly depressing. Is this entertianing? I can't see how."
2,Angela ashes,basic true story by frank mcourts who lived with his parents in america lost child who died for hungerthan move to ireland were better new life its is not true the place was very poor no clean water or food.However then its is very drama 2 child died in Angela mom's house then move to Laman Griffin (Bill galvin)house.There treath onfair Frank is very upset on his dad because he drink to much of amout of beer then his dad move toEngland there find new job he came never back why must Angela move to Laman Griffin.On the last part Frank go back to america on the dead of Mrs. Purcell take the money and to Travel Agent ask to America.Frank leave Ireland start new fresh start on America.the endthe opion on Angela ashes give I: 8Because that the last bit of the movie quiet boring because give no details about Americaand story quiet fast.It is very funny story
4,Great movie,"I enjoyed the movie, and of course movies sometimes are a bit of a let down from the book, but for those who rather just see the movie it does a fine job of telling the story. I read the book before seeing the movie and I thought they did a pretty good job, I do agree that there were some parts missing in the movie that was in the book. Emily Watson did a great job in this movie as well as each actor that played Frank McCourt. So regardless if you read the book or not I think you will enjoy this movie. And as for those, who think this movie is too Hollywood, well if that was the case then Frank's mom would have been played by Julia Roberts, his dad Tom Cruise, his aunt Britney Spears, and Frank would have been played by Will Smith, not to mention all the special affects they would have added to the movie. So I think it's a pretty good movie and recommend it."
4,Angela's Ashes,"This is a true story. Frank McCourt had a life that was quite unbearable. The squalid conditions and poor family relations would be difficult for anyone to endure. I did think there were some holes in the movie that I didn't quite understand, so I looked up the reviews of the book which helped a lot."
5,painful and beautiful,Frank McCourt's memoir is filled with pain but also a wry wit and a gentle spirit. Much of that survives on the screen to evoke all those elements in the movie.
3,It would be nice if ...,"The movie itself is great, however, it is not user friendly when you stream it off Amazon.com.It would be nice if there were scenes to choose from. It would also be nice if when youfast forward the movie would actually play - instead it needs to catch up to where youfast forward to (which takes a very long time)."
1,amazon should give more than 24 jours for 3 dollar rentals,I spent 3 bucks on this movie and missed the last hour of it because I thought I had more time and obviously did not. Amazon can afford to let the rental go till 9 the following evening like redbox. Very disappointed and WILL NOT be renting again.
2,Mediocre movie of a classic book! READ THE BOOK!,"Emily Watson is one of my favorite screen actresses and here she does not disappoint. She gives a wonderfully undertated performance. Robert Carlyle is also very good as he usually is. The boys also give really nice performances.The filmmakers do bring the wet locations to life - very much as they are imagined in the book.The major thing missing is the ""tone"" of the book. The book is hilarious - you laugh at the innocence of the boys point of view. Share his triumphs and sad at the set backs. That is what does not work about this movie.Also they left out a characted in the book (the little girl in the hospital) which was one of my favorite parts.Skip the film - read the book."
3,"A quality film, but relentlessly downbeat","There's definitely a place and a purpose for realistic films. But this one to me is too one sided, and while one can admire the acting and the photography, I had a feeling of wallowing in depression.I understand that the book is definitely a major work of literature. And the movie is instructive in it's portrayal of poverty. We need to realize and be aware of these things. But we also need the feeling of a human spirit that is capable of surviving and of finding joy in life.One may well be better off to read the book first to get all that the author intended. After reading the book, decide whether or not you want to see the movie, bearing in mind that many were disappointed by it."
5,Great pre-owned copy,"This is a wonderful pre-owned copy. I have been wanting to replace my VHS version of this film for years. The fulfilling company made sure to advise that the disc has scratches but plays fine, which is most definitely the case. This is a wonderful film and I am proud to add the DVD version to my collection."
2,Boring descent into abject poverty - no reason to exist,"This film has no reason to exist other than to create a boring two and a half hour unrelenting look at abject poverty - just about the most depressing and pointless film I've seen in years. The three child actors who portray Frank McCourt at various stages of his growth are exceptional and headed for serious acting careers, but the film has no reason for being other than to say ""Look at me, I rose above all this to become a writer so I could write about this depressing stuff."" The Oscar nom for score is a joke - there's very little original music and what there is is forgettable. John Williams' name and studio politics are at work here. Unless you're in a manic state and desirous of being brought down fast, avoid this film."
1,"Wonderful Book, Awful movie","I loved this book so much. I was so in depth to every page. I read the book for my junior class book chat. I am so happy that I picked that book to read. The movie on the other hand, left out so many details. I recommend not watching the movie after reading the book. It will dissappoint you. Go ahead and watch the movie if you never read the book it might be very good to you. I am not much of a book reader, but I love to watch movies but this movie was really not good. Sorry to Mr. Frank McCourt who wrote such a wonderful book that his movie had to be so bad."
4,Touching.,"Very seldom do films based upon a literary work stay true to the original text. Even more rare are films that are successful in such a venture. ANGELA'S ASHES is such a film. The film is an almost word for word adaptation of McCourt's beloved memoir and is full of all the novel's pathos and sympathy. The characters are real and the story is moving.The narration of the film, both adds and detracts from the movie's impact. The novel was very depressing, but was also filled with a self-depreciating wit and humor that lightened the seriousness of the situations described. In the movie, almost all of the scenes that contain any humor are the ones that include the narration. At the same time, the narration often does distract the audience from the drama occuring on screen.The acting is superb and the story is touching. And even though I read the book and knew the outcome of McCourt's adventures, the movie left me in tears at the end. Great art tends to do that."
3,Disappointing,"The book was engrossing. Too bad the film left so much out. Alan Parker's cinematic sense shines through, but I was never convinced of the poverty or the desperation elicited in the book. I never saw the McCourts in rags or visibly starving. The scene of the ""disappearing wall"" was missing as was any other subtle humor. The father had no discernable personality. This film could have been SO MUCH BETTER!!"
3,Good but book is better,I liked the book better. It described more vividly Frank's point of view on his trials and desperate poverty. Good read.
4,"Very Touching, Funny, and Inspiring","Most critics panned this movie, but I don't know why. I rented it despite the negative reviews, being a fan of the book of the same title by Frank McCourt.I was not disappointed at all. I found the movie to be very engaging. The entire cast was superb and the story was very good. OK, one problem: It could have been shorter. Other than that, it was a great movie.The story of Frank McCourt's childhood is universal and compelling. There is tragedy as well as comedy. AT the end of this movie, I was thoroughly satisfied."
5,Drop everything and read this entry in the New Frontier series,I have to say that as a fan of David's books that they just keep getting better. If your a fan of Shelby and Calhoun keep reading. I am not going to spoil any of the surprises for you. Only I'll say that this is one of the series that is worth reading. If it were up to me Peter David would write all the new Trek titles with the Next Generation universe.
5,Would you expect anything less?,"After years of listening to Al Wilson I wouldn't expect anything less than fantastic. He does it again in 2001. Fantastic C.D. It's not only that ""melt me"" voice, but the combination of songs on this C.D. brings enjoyment for whatever mood one may be in. As someone who is very critical of music and talent, I can honestly say this is well worth the investment. With his past hits and new songs, ""Spice of Life"" can be listened to and enjoyed by not only Mr. Wilson's long-time fans (with such songs as, Show and Tell and LaLa Peace Song) but ""true"" music lovers of all generations. Bravo for ""Spice of Life"""
1,Alternate Versions Or Copies Of This CD,"Please note, my rating on this CD is for a specific label. It appears there are at least two versions of this CD, one by World Music and the other by Ultimate Entertainment Distribution. The songs on my ""UED"" CD are not in the order shown on the CD song listing. The cover, as displayed here, is the same except the small round label (bottom left hand corner) is different. The UED version has all the songs, but not in the order shown on the jacket. It also appears the version of The Snake on this CD is not the original. I have another two copies which are both the same, but this one is different. It is not the song I remember listening to on the radio."
4,The Snake-Still a Classic,"This is worth the price I believe. Al Wilson has a good voice and sense of rhythm. Shortly before ""Show and Tell"" was released in 1973, I had the opportunity to speak to him in between shows where he was playing to only a couple hundred people in a club. I told him then that ""The Snake"" was one of my top ten favorite songs of the ""rock and roll"" era, not yet 20 years old. It's still true all these years later. His two major hits and the others on this compilation make it worth the price. A rollercoaster career I suppose, but I for one remain impressed."
2,Nowhere close to the original,"Let's face it. Pullman used up all he had 15 pages from the end of Golden Compass. This book is just churning for dough.The wonderful parts of Golden Compass - the characters, scene, and plot - give way to a contrived and pointless mysticism. If only Pullman had been capable of writing an ending to the Golden Compass, we would have been spared this disturbing and shallow read."
2,A warning to Christain parents,"Christain parents whose children may read this book, I would highly recommend that you read this trilogy before your children do. You should be prepared to discuss Pullman's series with your kids after they've read it. The premise of the trilogy is that the Christian God and his heavenly host are in a conspiracy to keep mankind enslaved. Indeed in Pullman's trilogy, the ""fallen angels"" are the force for good. Most Christian denominations would consider this story line to be questionable at best. I understand that Philip Pullman is an avowed atheist--one who doesn't believe in God--but what does one call someone who sides with the ""fallen angels?"""
1,WHAT HAPPENED??????!!!!!!!!,"When I read the Golden Compass I loved it. The plot was interesting, Lyra was intriguingand so was the concept of daimons. I was very excited to read the Subtle Knife. I was sorely disappointed.First of all, Lyra lost all trace of her personality with the arrival of Will. Second, I know good books shouldhave protagists of both genders but I thought Pan was enough. Will seemed just too boring to be interesting.Third, the anti God gist. I'm not Christian, and I have no qualms with books about fantasy magic. But after portraying Lord Arisel as the God killing hero was in very bad taste.Then the children wanting to kill children made me queasy. The blood thirstiness young children displayed towards Lyra and Will was appalling. The books shouldn't not get darker, Harry Potter as an example, but that was just wrong.In short, what could have been a wonderful series was forced to fall into despicability."
3,Suffers from middle-volume syndrome,"Although it kept me reading, The Subtle Knife didn't have quite the impact that The Golden Compass had. Parts of the book were brilliant--Lee Scoresby was an interesting, complex character--but on the whole, it felt as if Pullman was marshalling characters and plot developments to get ready for the ""good stuff"" in the third book.Although I find the theological basis of this book more than a little troubling, I will reserve judgement until the third book. Asriel, like Milton's Satan, *seems* be to be portrayed as a heroic figure, but that could change."
5,WHAM! Here come the heavy hitters,"And it is just so great to read a book and know, deep down, that it will be read again, and read to one's children and cherished. The first book opened the door and the second invited all the guests, so the third book is the party. But wow, what a richer, more nuanced world we have after the ~300 pages of The Subtle Knife. We find evil in children, Dust as dark matter and all of the lovely complexity that makes reading such a wonder and joy. And now we really know what Lord Asriel is up to, although Mrs. Coulter is still revealing surprises of her own. I should probably stop writing and start reading. One of the best fantasy series' ever, in the second rank under Tolkien and George R.R. Martin's Fire and Ice series."
5,Great Book,This was an excellent book. I had read the first one and couldn't wait to read this one. It was worth the wait. I will be glad when the last book of the trilogy when it is for sale.
3,"Unstoppable action, but some parts disappointing","The pace of the book is fast, but some parts happened so fast, I had to reread them--especially the death scenes. I was surprised that characters died so quickly after fulfilling their purpose in the story. I would have liked more development or closure.I was disappointed that Lyra wasn't as strong a character as in the first book. I never understood why she had to wait for Will's permission before using the alethiometer. I would like to think that Lyra learns from her mistakes and would only use the alethiometer for good reasons--and how would Will know when to use it or not?There is no clear definition of good and bad. Who is evil? Is God evil? Is Lord Asriel good? What are the boundaries?Overall, the book was a good read, but not as cleanly written as the first. The ending is a cliffhanger, as expected, but unfortunately, this means the book cannot stand alone. It relies on the history of the first book and the conclusion of the third book."
2,I can't bring myself to like this book.,"One the one hand, this book, like its predecessor, delivers an exciting story and an imaginary world that is weirdly compelling. On the other, it's often sloppily written and clumsily plotted. For example, I lost count of how many times in the first two books Pullman puts his characters into some tight spot, only to have them rescued by a deus ex machina arriving at the last possible second. This happened over and over again, to the point of comedy.In addition to its creaky mechanics, the book often seems to revel in suffering and violence, and its tone occasionally verges on the preachy. I was involved in this book while I was reading it, but now that I'm done I don't think I'll have the urge to pick it up again."
5,The saga heats up!,"Pullman has improved on The Golden Compass, brilliant in its own right. The terrific story continues to develop and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The best part of this book is that it appeals to fantasy lovers and people with no imagination(me). Don't be scared off just because it is a fantasy. I was skeptical, but I enjoyed this book greatly. This is a good bet for all readers. I can't wait to read the third book."
5,A thriller that will never let you go.,"This book was just great. From the time I picked it up I never wanted to put it down. And being a teenager it's hard to find a book that would do that for me. It has all the adventure and thrills that lead you on a simply amazing ride. Although I haven't read the book before this one in the trilogy, I thought this one was awesome. When I found out the next part doesn't come out till May I almost died. I'm on the edge all ready for the next part of the trilogy. Anyone with any imangation read this, it expands your mind to the outter limits. A definate pleaser!"
5,These are among the most incredible books I've ever read.,"This trilogy is the most stunning, incredible series of books ever written. A must-read for Pullman fans, they display his unbelieveable talent for weaving a storyline so fraught with adventure and yet still so true to life that the outcome is a book that is impossible to put down. This particular book, The Subtle Knife, is just as good as the first in a different way, though somewhat maddening as Mr. Pullman seemed to enjoy killing off some of my favorite characters. Moreover, these books seem less a product of someone's imagination than actual happenings, they are described with such detail. One can not help but enjoy these books, primarily for their great plot, secondly for their vivid storytelling, and finally for their ability to make you reflect upon them for weeks to come. I encourage everyone to read these novels, as well as the Sally Lockhart trilogy, and most everything written by Philip Pullman, for that matter."
5,"ONe word: EXTREMLY GOOD, wait that was two...","Man THE SUBTLE KNIFE is a great book, i rented THE GOLDEN COMPASS from the library finsihed it in a day and bought TSK the same day...I'm a 17 year old reader and i think TSK is one of the best books i have ever read. And i've read alot of books. Comparing His Dark Materials Trilogy to Harry Potter is pointless because His dark materials outclasses it by leaps and bounds, i wish as many children and teenagers who read Harry Potter would read The Subtle knife, maybe then there would be someway to save my generation.By making them think past the end of theier nose. THis goes for the over 20 bunch as well"
2,Huge Disappointment,"I really liked the first dark materials book. It was very exciting and Pullman created a great character in Lyra. What the hell happened to her between the first book and the last 2? She suddenly hooks up with a male figure, Will, and she's suddenly a sidekick? Her deferential attitude in this book is completely at odds with her fiery persona from book 1.Also, if the whole point of these books was to prove you should think for yourself, why have the characters blindly follow this alethiometer when they don't know whose controlling it? It seemed a pretty weak plot device to me.I won't bother telling anyone not to read it, because if they read the first book they'll be too anxious to find out what happened to Lyra to listen. I know I was! Just borrow it from someone or visit a library so you don't waste the cash. It isn't one you'll reread."
2,Don't like this one!,"I liked the 1st book and when I finished reading it, I was excited to read the 2nd one. I don't know if I want to read the last book. This book left me feeling empty, confused, and the Specters gave me the creeps. Lyra wasn't the same anymore. She took a back seat to Will. The Subtle Knife doesn't make me crave for more."
4,Solid Sequel,"This sequel picked up right from whereThe Golden Compass, Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition (His Dark Materials, Book 1)(Rough-cut)ended and kept my interest from start to finish. I enjoyed it quite a bit! The ending particularly thrilled and shocked me. It was both exciting and tinged with sadness. Where the plot will end in the third book seems unpredictable to me, so I am really looking forward to completing the trilogy.As for the controversial religious aspect? Well, it is a bit more involved here, but still not anything more blasphemous than a typical fantasy novel. Readers can pick and choose how they want to interpret the religious angle - the same as in any fantasy novel that bothers to create its own slant on religion. Needless to say, I did not find it to be troubling. And my only real complaint about the whole book was the over-use of the title within the prose - it really was overkill to use the same phrase so often!"
3,Complex,"I liked this book for the most part. It's extremely imaginative. Not only did the author create worlds separate from our own, but he makes them seem entirely believable. My issue is the confusion. This story is so complex at times, I have no idea what is going on. I reread passages, and hope for the best. If I have a hard time understanding (and I consider myself an educated adult), what in the world does the targets audience think? Do they just skim over the passages that are trying to explain dust, or angels, or spectors (for example). I applaud Philip Pullman for what he is trying to accomplish with this story, but it just feels like to much."
4,"Excellent, but no attempt to finish the book","This book was one of the most enjoyable books that I have ever read. Our class first studied Northern Lights, and the ending, promising much, but closing the story, made me pick up the Subtle Knife. The ending of this book, though, leaves you with the story completely open. He should have made the Subtle Knife slightly longer and finished the story rather that leaving it like that. It feels like later on, when I pick up the amber spy glass, I will be reading the next chapter of the Subtle Knife. Apart from the ending, just about perfect."
5,A really page turning book!,"Wow! Philip Pullman surprised us once again with this great ability to write. Though I believed that the Subtle Knife wasn't as exciting as the first book, The Golden Compass, it still keeps the reader locked into the book!"
4,Intriguing...,"Reviews for this book seem to have gotten further from the actual content of this book towards the whole religious aspect.I quite enjoyed The Subtle Knife. The plot was thoroughly engrossing and the characters were lively and interesting. The religious aspect was very thought-provoking and an altogether interesting view of looking at things. However, being an atheist, I'm probably more inclined to find this so.The one thing I didn't like about the book was the ending. I hate cliff-hangers and boy is this a big one. It annoyed me as a deliberate device to encourage readers to read the third book (though it will undoubtedly work on many people-- myself included). Over all, though, highly recommended. One hint-- start reading the second one after the third comes out so you can get ahold of it immediately."
5,AN EXCELLENT BOOK!!!!!!!!!,"The Subtle Knife mainly focuses on the two main characters, Will and Lyra, but on a grander scale, it intertwines the beauties and mysteries of the universe--northern lights, dark matter, parallel worlds--to create a fantasy that's simply compelling. Personally, I've never heard of anything like northern lights before, but after reading this book, it really sparked my interest in finding out more about what they are in real life. Anyway, I'm getting a little off topic here. Overall, The Subtle Knife is an excellent book with a great plot and interesting characters. Angels, daemons, witches (not the scary looking ones on Halloween, these witches are good and extremely beautiful), Specters, Shadows, and many other strong characters help to make this book an unforgetable experience.P.S. Maybe it's just me but it took me a really long time to notice there was a tower on the cover of this book..."
4,huge fan of this series,"Another great installment in this highly acclaimed trilogy. I'm very happy that I've exposed myself to these stories because they keep getting better. The Subtle Knife dives deeper into Lyra's story, exposing the reader to more characters, more worlds, and more details as to what this series is really about. I don't know much else to say about these books since I'm pretty sure most everyone on the planet has read them, but I really am enjoying this series and am looking forward to the third and final book!"
5,A sequel that is divine...,"The series takes a whole new direction with the second installment of Pullman's masterful series. Pullman is a genius at creating things that have never been seen or done before. He claims he has pulled ideas from other works, but he certainly is no copycat. (...) These books surely have had many Christians up in arms with its approach, and its mentioning of fighting someone specific, however, the story is intriguing just the same, and the characters are very rich and ever-growing. Throw in a few Specters, spirits who feast on the souls of adults, and you have a good new group of monsters to contend with. Some of the other characters from the first book also make appearances, such as Lee Scoresby, the balloon aeronaut, and Serafina Pekkala, a witch queen. Don't hesitate to read this entire series."
4,The Subtle Knife is one of the best books I've read.,"Seldom is the sequel better than the original. However, in this case, I find that The Subtle Knife is infinately better than The Golden Compass. Having already introduced main characters and main ideas, Mr. Pullman can bring out ideas and philosophies that capture the imagination and spark new thoughts. The only reason I did not completely enjoy this book was because of the cliffhanger ending that left me begging for the third installment of His Dark Materials. On the whole, however, The Subtle Knife is a superbly crafted literary work suitable for almost any reader of almost any age."
5,This book rocked!!,"I loved this book, and I thought Philip Pullman has a great mind. A lot of you think this book is satinous. What kind of world do we live in, so that we can't accept one another's feelings about God? I think anyone who thinks this book shouldn't be given to kids is dog-matic. Kids are their own people, and can't be told what books to read. On the brighter side, this book was one of the best ones I have ever read. I loved when Will found his father, and could almost feel how Serefina felt when she knew she had to kill the witch being tortured. DOES ANYONE KNOW THE TITLE OF THE NEXT BOOK? I have looked everywhere, and I can't find it!!!"
5,One of the best books ever written,"This was definetly one of the best books i've ever read, for any age group at any time. i recomend this book to everyone who enjoys fantasy books!"
3,"Eh, an average fantasy","Not much action or plot in my opinion. I don't really recommend this, because the plot goes too quickly. Chapter to chapter is a new topic, no chance to ponder or think about what happened. Not written well either, nothing that was done connected or made sense in the end. Must have been thrown together by the author for a quick sequel. I didn't find this satisfying, so maybe you should just read THE GOLDEN COMPASS again."
5,Awesome,Fulfilling in every way! I will remember the feeling of these books forever. A definite must read for every age.
4,Early arrival but a little concerned by the packaging,"I was happy the book came so quickly but I also bought another book in set. It was sent separately and the packaging was so much better. The corner of this book was a light bent and this could have been avoided if the book had been packaged the same way as the ""Amber Spyglass""."
1,Umm.. how should I say this...,"Sorry to disapoint you 5 star givers, but I mean, this book is a discrace at the lesat. For God to be the bad guy, is as low as it can go, EVEN LOWER!! What did this auther have in his mind when he wrote this? The deamon? But, I would not waste your $$$ on this so called 'good read' book!!"
1,IF YOUR CHRISTAIN BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved the first book,The Golden Compass,but this book is wrong. If your a christain do not read. This book is a disgrace. full of nonsense. all about rebel angels and man kind raging a war against heaven. Not, to mention emphasizes that god is cruel and evil. This book doesn't even deserve 1 star!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Atheist Propaganda,"This atheistic diatribe, along with other so-called fiction books likeHarry Potter Boxset Books 1-7andRabid: A Novel, will destroy the soul of America if not stopped immediately. I call upon Amazon to stop selling them, for they are teaching people that Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ does not exist or is not relavant to today. This is wrong! Protect your children from these books!"
4,Entertaining read,This is the second book of the His Dark Materials series. It's a nice little action read. I got the books on tape version for a long car trip and it made the trip much more enjoyable.
4,Good Overall,"In the second book of the ""His Dark Materials"" series, Philip Pullman brought out some great writing. A little unlike the first in the series, this book had great plot twists that kept you on the edge of your seat. I also really liked that after the loss of her best friend in the first book, he brought someone else into the life of Lyra named Will so that she would have a companion along with her. Whats more, having him be the bearer of the subtle knife was great because he then had a big part to play alongside Lyra."
4,The Subtle Knife,"Will and Lyra are bound on an adventure they will never forget. Stranded in a world that is not their own they met. Lyra is on a quest to find dust. Will, now the bearer of the subtle knife, a knife that can cut through worlds, is bound to her. Will they survive? This book will both horrify and delight you. If you want a challenge read The Subtle Knife."
5,Addictive,"This book is truly the best, most imaginative work since Tolkien. The way in which he captivates the readers attention is tremendous.This sequel, unlike others, is as good, if not better than the first book, Northern Lights. I strongly recommend this book. A great read."
5,it was just as exciting as the last one & made you want more,"The book was just as good as the first one but it introduced more characters to love and hate. Will is an excillent character whose brave,street wise,and can fend for himself. I can't wait to read the next book!"
3,"As compelling as the first, but a bit more disturbing....","Philip Pullman still has an incredible mastery of powerful language that brings strong imagery to mind and definitely pulls the reader into the story, and I really appreciate the new character of Will. However, as a deeply religious person, I find the idea of a new rebellion against God -- particularly as strongly advocated as this book seems to make it -- with no positive representation, disturbing. It's one thing to portray a god that is aloof & absent, accurately represented by & responsible for reprehensible 'agents' on the earth, but to use our own Scripture to describe this god tells something that I not only don't believe, but I find offensive to something most important to me. I hope that this is better resolved in the 3rd book."
1,"His Dark Materials, Book 2: the subtle knife",I order this audiobook over a month ago and i still havent recieved it yet. So be careful what u order on amazon.
1,THE BOOK WAS MORE THAN GREAT!!!,THIS BOOK WAS FANTASTIC!!!!! I put one star so you would read my review. This review I write is mostly to the ones who thought it wasn't right for people to read it. I do agree that it did bother me about the whole thing about God but it helped me realize how I was close to God. Besides that I LOVED IT. Somebody said that it was a terrifying book. Hello people this book is science fiction. And calling Will a murderer is wrong. It was the own guys fault in my opinion. Who ever hasn't read this book better go out and buy it right now. You are missing all the excitement. READ IT!!
5,A reveiw of The Subtle Knife,"This book is MAGNIFICENT. I loved The Golden Compass and have been waiting forever for the sequel to come out. It's just as good as the prequel, and in some ways it's even more intense. One thing is for sure: He'd better hurry up with the next one!This book is very suspensful and exciting. Cittagazze is actually a pretty neat world-it you're a child, that is. It was also interesting to note Lyra's reactions to our world, such as the disappearance of Jordan. I also liked the way that the witch culture was described.One thing I was a little surprised about was that there were religious undertones in this book. But it didn't ruin the plot at all-which I really liked. I could never combine religion and fiction like that.I guess that all I can say is this: If you loved The Golden Compass, this is a must read."
3,"While it was exciting, this book needs work.","The Subtle Knife was a good book, with wonderfullyput together fantasy. Pullman's characters arecharming, with bold and daring unmatched.This time though, The Subtle Knife did not comeclose to living up to it's sister book, The GoldenCompass. The plot was too stretched, and it didnot capture the attention it should."
3,This book was stop-and-go. It did not seem complete.,"The story started slow, picked up in the middle, slowed once more, then ended at a moment of suspense. Pullman ended it like this I believe to insure the purchase of the third book in the trilogy. Whereas the Golden Compass is story with a begining, middle, and end. The Subtle Knife has a begining and middle."
3,Maybe it's just me...,"Okay, I've read ""The Golden Compass"" and I absolutely loved it. It's a very powerful book in the sense that it makes the reader feel sadness or joy or whatever at the appropriate moments and also lets the reader feel like he or she is really in the midst of these events. But ""The Suble Knife"" was different, if not disappointing, because it seemed to focus on Will as the main character and thus conveyed a lot of bitterness because that's what Will felt. And I don't appreciate calling Lyra stupid just because she sees stealing as the best method for getting something that was stolen from her! Maybe it's just because I'm a girl and the main character seems to be a boy this time, and also I don't like the sad parts of books, but it just wasn't what I expected after reading the glorious Book 1."
5,One of the greatest books,"The Subtle Knife is a wonderful book. And you cannot let your religion stop you from reading it. Anyone who says it is going to far is wrong.Its aboutWill from our world, who meets Lyra in the world of Citaggaz'e. And a weapon that can destroy everything-or release it. The knife has intentions of it's own, you will learn. Lyra and Will go through worlds, while trying to dodge Mrs. Coulter and Sir Charles. In Citaggaz'e they find specters that have slowly been killing everything, but not with death. They also find troops of Angels and become friends with Balthamos and Baruch. It is a great book and a pleasure to read."
4,A thought-provoking book!,"This was an amazing book, but I do think that it could have been better. I LOVED 'A Golden Compass' and this just barely matches the standers set by the first book. Still worth the read though."
2,Boring.,"I wonder if Pullman actually knew what he was getting into when he started this fantasy trilogy. This book goes absolutely nowhere, and it was difficult to finish. I couldn't care less for any of the characters, and I really hope they don't make a movie out of it."
3,"A good story, but mixed-up religious views.","As a huge fan of the prequel ""The Golden Compass"", I could hardly wait to read this book. It started out great, very similar to it's prequel. The description was amazing, and the story was so gripping that it took me only 4 or 5 hours to finish it. But the whole thing about Lord Asriel planning a war against God seemed wrong. I thought it was horrible to suggest that God and religion is responsible for all the horrible things in the world. I think that Philip Pullman had a great idea about daemons and ulternate universes, but he kind of destroyed it with the whole idea of this battle against God. Other then that, this was an excellant story, very creative. But the religious views are too strong for a fantasy book.If you read ""The Golden Compass"", go ahead and read this book, but it's kind of important to remember that this _is_ just a fantasy book."
4,Not as good as The Golden Compass,"I actually think that the Golden Compass was more fascinating. It kept you more on the edg of your seet, and I liked hearing about Lyra and her side of the story. On the audo cassette, I liked how the characters were played by the same people."
5,The Subtle Knife is a WONDERFUL book,"This book is one of my favorites! I think how Philip Pullman writes is terrific and suspenseful. He really knows how to keep you reading! If you haven't read this book I highly recommend it to you-- although you should read the Golden Compass before reading The Subtle Knife. But when you read it make sure you have a lot of time, because in some places you just can't read fast enough!"
5,It was hard to put down!!!,I have read the first two books in the series and have found them amazing. The golden compass(book one) was one of the best books I have ever read beaten only by the subtle knife. I bouight the book got home and started to read. It was about 3 oclock. I didn't stop reading it till I was finished which was quite a few hours later. Basically if you like the golden compass you will love this book. The only thing that I don't like about this book is that it was published a little over a year ago I think and the third book is coming out in september of 99 which is in a long time and the book leavees you hanging.
3,"The Subtle Knife (His Dark Materials, Book 2)","Not just for kids! Imaginative and fascinating story. It is helpful to have read the first book, but it does stand alone quite well."
3,Good Story,Good reading. A little more mysterious than Golden Compass. May be too frightening for some younger reader.
3,Not comparable to other young people's fiction,"While I might agree that Pullman is anti-authoritarian rather than anti-Catholic or anti-religious, it is the apparant amorality of the main characters that would prevent me from recommending this book to anyone other than an adult. Lyra and Will show little real understanding of the value of life, feelings of others and so on that can be found in the Harry Potter series or the Narnia Chronicles. If we could prove the existance of God, or an 'Authority', should our first response to our Creator be to destroy this entity? Given humanity's despoilation of this world, our endless wars and refusal to share resources does it follow that we are ready to be masters of all we preceive and should have no checks on ourselves? Pullman writes an engaging story but one that leaves me unable to truly care about characters who only on a superficial level care about others."
5,Fantastic,"This book intorduces Will Parry, and reintroduces some of the most beloved and memorable characters you'll ever read about in your entire long life!"
2,Dissapointing,"After reading the Golden Compass (my new favorite book) I couldn't wait for the release of Subtle Knife. I got it the first day the book stores had it. After I read it, I was a little let down. I was expecting a spectacular sequel to a great peice of work, but in reality, it was a mediocre story. Minimal plot twists made it a little boring. Too bad, maybe the next book will be better."
3,What a mysterious title...,"I wondered about what this book could possibly be about. The book seems so metaphysical in essence. I found that the idea of daemons that were captured inside different enchanted animals was connected to the belief that some birds can talk and can hear thoughts, say for example in the Edgar Allan Poe poem the Raven, when the raven spoke to the person about the name of his true love. Anyhow, this is a British book that talks about how a chosen child endures certain adventures of mystery, mysticism, might and majesty. The book really takes you away to a fanciful world that is only connected to the real world in the concept of spirits and supernatural powers, which cannot be defined in the real world anyways."
4,His Dark Materials Boxed Set: Part Two of Three,"The golden compass of the first book was a special future-telling instrument which, when used correctly, can answer any question you ask it. Lyra happens to be of the chosen variety that has the natural skill to read it. In this book we meet our next hero, Will Parry, who is from our world. He finds and becomes the beholder of the subtle knife, a special knife with one side so sharp it can cut any material object, and the other side so sharp it can cut through the fabric of reality and open a doorway into another world. And so the reader realizes the great complexity of this universe with its many worlds. Lyra and Will now continue their journey, both in search of their fathers with the help of many unusual characters like giant bears and witches.Originally published on May 12th, 2003 Alex C. Telander.Go to BookBanter ([...]) for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
4,love it,thx so much for resending the books over night because the first 1s never came idk y but i thank u soooo much my son loves the books
3,Fell Flat,"I thought that _The Subtle Knife_ fell flat as a sequel to the impressive _The Golden Compass_. Generally, the first book was richer in imagination, and the characters more varied and fuller. I was especially disappointed in how the character Lyra worked in this book, subservient to Will and without a trace of the independence, resourcefulness, and bravado that won us over in the first book. Will, by contrast, seemed almost two-dimensional, and I never did connect with him. And somehow, the idea of a knife that cuts through anything did not capture my imagination in the same way as the alethiometer, with its arcane symbols and unknown workings. I can only hope that the third and final book will make up for this."
3,Good trilogy,"I'm anxious to read the third and final book in this series and find out what happens to the characters. The second book was just as good as the first, but I was disappointed that the main character Lyra didn't seem as strong as she did in the first book--and her strength is precisely what I loved about her in the first place. She follows rather than leads in this book, and I'm uncomfortable with how she beats herself up about mistakes she's made. The latter is common human behavior, but with so few strong female characters in children's literature, it would have been nice to see her struggle with these feelings and accept what she's done and move on. If her character did do this, I didn't pick up on it myself. Here's to hoping she regains her strength in the final book!"
4,The Subtle Knife or The STRONG Knife!,At school I won a prize for book tokens. I spent a long time deciding but i chose The Northern Lights and read it. Superb. I went immediately back to the shop after i'd finished it and bought the Subtle Knife. Reading it was great. The twist when when Will cut his fingers gave me the creeps because 1 month later I did the same! Overall cool book! At Christmas i got The Amber Spyglass the 3rd in the series.Bye y'all!Da fraz man
4,Really good but a little too confusing and short in places.,"I thought The Subtle Knife was very, very good, much better than The Sally Lockhart Trilogy. The death scenes were so sad they made me cry! It made me wish I had a daemon. I did think, though, that the author should have explained a little better why exactly the witch wanted to kill Will's father. I also can't figure out if Lord Asriel is good or bad. I mean he has no sympathy whatsoever and doesn't really care what he does to other people so long as the end result is what he wants, but then Will and Lyra seem to be on his side, the ""good"" side. Those are the only complaints I had, and other than that the book was wonderful. I think you should definitely read this book, but be prepared because it is absolutely impossible to put down and once you finish you will want to go straight to the third! Where is the third, anyway?"
5,I really like the Subtle Knife,"I am usually let down b sequals, but this is a big exception. I was as impressed with this book as I was with The Golden Compass."
4,Amazing book,The subtle knife is an amazing thrilling book in which you will not want to put it down until you're done.
1,A bit Deux Ex Machina,I didn't read this like 90% of the population when I was 12 it was only later when a friend gave them to me for Christmas. While I dislike the entirety of the series for it did nothing to grab me and feels like recycled atheistic arguments blended with someone taking the warhammer 40k lore a bit too seriously. The subtle knife is the worst of the series for me as it gives the characters an 'out' to every problem which in itself is a bit galling. The whole setup seems to have been created just to give a vehicle to further Pullmans agenda.
3,subtle knife - not for kids!,"The Subtle Knife is based on a pretty grim story line - and - definitely NOT a book for children ... but rather more something for those (commonly called: adolescents&adults;) who don't mind so much, if the 'good' characters step by step die/get killed and the 'bad' guys always seem to come through. (kind of like the Harry Potter series)The story itself is very well written ... but as said, just pretty ""dark material""."
5,MY FAVORITE FANTASY OF THE PAST FEW YEARS,"Pullman has crammed more original ideas into this trilogy than many authors have in their entire writing career. The guy actually invents a new sin and makes us feel repugnance for it!I don't know why so many people are referring to this as a kid's book. I suppose it's because Pullman's previous books were written in a young adult category, and the two main characters are pre-adolescent. Considering that part of the plot set-up is the transformation of the personal daemon as a person ages, I'm guessing that some big surprises will be in store for us in part 3 as Lyra ages.Perhaps this ""coming-of-age"" aspect of the story is why it is thought of as a non-adult book.But I'm in my 40's, definitely not coming-of-age, and this is the best fantasy I've read in the past few years."
4,Great follow-up,"The Subtle Knife is a little slow to really get going but peservere and the story really takes off. Will, like Lyra, is believable and likeable, and the two make a great pair as they travel between worlds and try to make sense of what is going on. Once again, Pullman's imagination is on top form, with lots of spooky Spectres, the Subtle Knife itself and more of the horrid Mrs. Coulter. The only let-down is the ""Adam & Eve"" element and the explinations about Dust and dark matter."
5,This is not a children's book.,"I picked this book up in an Oxford bookstore to pass the time in Heathrow waiting for an international flight, and was so enthralled I hardly noticed when the flight was (as usual) late. Some key characters are young, but this is NOT a children's book (I'm afraid to read it aloud to my 8-year-old). This book is by turns surprising, thoughtful, and poignant, and never dull. Pullman is at his weakest when he tries to hang his philosophical points on recent developments in particle physics, but his characters' emotions are so real and so intense that mere factual awkwardness can be dismissed. I'm waiting impatiently for the next book."
4,"Compelling,but........","This book is the first one I`ve read,but it won`t be the last.Lyra,Pan,and Will are sort of friends to the reader,and the many enemies are foes.However,The Subtle Knife has some controversial issues about God which as a Christian,I find disturbing.It`s also at times a little hard to grasp. This series has been described as a rival to the acclaimed Harry Potter books,which I also enjoy,and it`s fun to read what Pantalaimon changes into(leopards,goldfinches,mice,moths?)"
4,Cuts to the quick!,"Having written a review for the Golden Compass only days ago, I am now regretting giving it 4 stars because I loved the Subtle Knife so much more. I just found the storyline infinitely more rivetting.With the Subtle Knife, I definitely can see now, the serious religious undercurrents (who am I kidding, tidle waves) that flow through this book. An afront to God? Perhaps, but it makes for damn good reading! I can't wait to start book three, in order to find out exactly who the good guys are and what Lyra must do in order to fulfill her destiny (and destroy others).Some parts of the book did drag. I find Lyra and Will's story most interesting and often raced through the chapters that did not contain them in order to get back to the ""main adventure"". I can't wait to read ""The Amber Spyglass"".If I could give 4.5 stars, I would, because I have a feeling I should reserve 5 stars for the final installment."
3,I guess it was ok.,"The Golden Compass is one of my favorite books, I have to admit but The Subtle Knife, well, it kind of bothered me. That stuff about gob being evil reallly bothered me. I dont think he should have messed with religon in any kind of way. I hope that subjecit will take a different route in the 3rd book because I didn't really enjoy this book as much as the first one."
4,A Decent second book in the Trilogy,After reading The Golden Compass I quickly purchased The Subtle Knife eager to discover more of Pullman's imaginative and well-crafted world. The Subtle Knife was fast-paced and full of excitement which kept me turning the pages yet it lacked the richness and causality of the first book-The Golden Compass. I am not a writer so I have little to say when it comes to solidly criticizing an author's form yet I am a composer of music and know a bit about the subject. I have to say that The Subtle Knife lacks the richness and depth of his first book and contains a significant number of awkward and predictable passages that dissappoint. Not once while reading the Golden Compass did I find myself thinking these thoughts. Altogether The Subtle Knife was a good book but it doesn't satisfy the expectations left by the first.
5,Great sequal to the Golden Compass,"In this book, the adventure continues with Lyra, Pantalaimon, Mrs. Coulter, Lord Asriel, and the witches. There is also a new character, Will, who is a boy from the other world. They travel to the North of the new world in pursuit of Lord Asriel so that they can help him with the war against the angels. With Mrs. Coulter on their tail, will they make it? A great book! Philip Pullman has created a soon-to-be original. He puts fantasy and excitement into his books. I definitely give this book a 5-star review!"
3,A Great Sequel,"The Subtle Knife was a wonderful continuation of the Golden Compass. However, it was not nearly as interesting as far as the plot goes. As a matter of fact, I thought that it was a little too intense for such a short book. The introduction of Will was well done, but it just wasn't the same to turn the spot light to him instead of Lyra. After reading the Amber Spyglass, one might reconsider their thoughts as I have. Now I think of the Subtle Knife as more of a ""transition book"". Without it, the Amber Spyglass would not have been nearly as good as it is."
5,Satanic? Whatever!,"If you are true christians that read this book and think its satanic, then you might want to start to question things a little more often. If we dont think and question are faith and go on only what we have been told assuming that it is all true we arent glorifing god at all because were going on the base of conformity and not on the base of believing these things of our own free will. Part of faith is questioning it. If we dont do that we arent challenging it and it can never be proved right or wrong, good or evil. Read the book again and keep an open mind because it is written EXTREMELY well and is appealing. The point of books are for entertainment, being cynical of all the aspects and contradictions of belief to a book wont be very entertaining.BOTTOM LINE: Read the book with an open mind and an understanding that its okay to THINK and to QUESTION."
3,Disappointing - don't expect it to match The Golden Compass,"If The Golden Compass hadn't been so good, Iwouldn't be so disappointed. The Golden Compasshas texture, intricacy, and strong characters. The Subtle Knife is bland. Damn! I was looking forward to it."
5,Excellent,"Fast-paced and heart-thrilling this book continues right where the Subtle Knife left off. People with short boredom spans will enjoy this book as it jumps from character to character. It may seem incomplete to some of you, but pick up the third one and let all your problems be solved."
5,Excellent,"I thought that it was an excellent book and that all the people thought that it was a bad idea for Pullman to question the religion are wrong. Pullman was questioning the followers of it and not God. Whos side were the angels on; Lord Asriel. I think that The Authority is represented as God but God himself is not the one being questioned. Pullman was questioning the church and how its dictatoring ways ruled the world in a cruel way but God, God was not being questioned"
5,An excellent sequel to The Golden Compass.,"Enchanting, you don't want to put it down, and when you finish, you wish you had the third book."
5,Madam Butterfly,THIS CD IS A RARE ITEM WITH BEAUTIFUL BALLADS YOU CAN APPRECIATE. IT TOOK ME ALONG TIME TO RECAPTURE THIS TREASURE. I WAS VERY PLEASE WITH THIS PURCHASE.
4,the seven steps to mercy,I purchased this after reading another customer's review. I found it to be everything the review said it would be. I am pleased.
2,Some good...some bad,"Bought this set as it was the ""platinum"" set. Thought it would be a good one. Right out of the gate, the birdie was getting stuck in the strings of the raquets on every 3rd or 4th hit. That was extremely frustrating and caused us to quit playing shortly after starting. On a positive note, the net and volleyball seem to be of good quality and the set up was pretty easy. Ultimately...we'd use it for badminton the most and with the raquet strings being so loose that you can't play with them, the set is very disappointing. Would love to send it back, but can't find my receipt."
5,Absolutely incredibly delicious!!!,I can't live without knowing these are in my freezer and ready for consumption!!!!!!! All ingredients are good for your health!
5,Easy Attendance,I use this chart to take attendance. I also put colored sticks in the lower pockets and teach the students a code so that I can use it for lunch count as well! Anything to make life easier....
5,Good Quality,The Carson-Dellosa Attendance/multipurpose pocket chart is very high quality material. Very heavy duty and seems like it will hold up very well. I'm using mine as a job chart so my kids pull cards in and out of it multiple times a day. Great product and worth the money.
4,Very pleased with this shoe,"I want to share my oppion with you because I am very pleased with this shoe. The shoe size it is as expected, it is comfortable (air cushion at the heels not mentioned), good looking, well made, nice leather. Thing to be aware is that it isn't safe on certain wet surfaces. I do not give them the five star because of that but I surely recommend them. Good and nice shoes."
3,good,"the book is good , but I would like that the book has more questions at the final each chapter. Is only my opinion, maybe for another persons is well."
5,Good CD.... for rock fans only though...,"Let's get right to the point... If you don't like hard rock/techno, don't buy this cd. Just look at who's on it and you should know. Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, Disturbed, Orgy, Deftones, Snake River Conspiracy, etc. Every song goes well with the movie except for Son Song, which is not Sean Lennon on his own, it is with Soulfly. I love this cd and just recently found it, so I have been listening to it non-stop. It doesn't get old at all, which is a good mark for any cd...."
5,Question...,"There is a song that occurs in the movie where Kate Capshaw has just finished sleeping with her boyfriend. It's kind of a soft, triphop styled song. Anyone have any clue what that song is and/or who it is by? I tried checking the song listings at imdb.com, but they only have this soundtrack listed. Any help is appreciated."
4,Great rock music,"I haven't seen the movie because I've heard that it is horrible, but when I heard a listing of the artists on the soundtrack, I went out and bought this on the day it came out. Almost all of the songs can be found on the artists' albums, but I love this soundtrack; a lot of the songs have very catchy tunes and/or mixes, demented love song lyrics, and an overall great industrial sound. The best songs: Linkin Park's ""Pushing Me Away,"" Deftones' ""RX Queen,"" Orgy's ""Opticon,"" Professional Murder Music's ""Fall Again,"" and Snake River Conspiracy's ""Breed."" These songs are awesome and I keep them on repeat. If you like the soundtracks for Scream 3 and Dracula 2000, then you'll love this CD."
3,An o.k. later-era work,"Although I think Tangerine Dream are producing trite space-pop music now and have lost their influence on the music scene since the mid-'80s, I pursue all their releases up to this day. I think ""Transsiberia"" is a bit better than all the other countless and uninspired late-'90s releases, which overstock the record market. On this album, TD incorporated some really funky techno rhythms, which make tracks like ""Siberian Lights"" a pleasure to listen. Unfortunately there are also some boring tracks without rhythm backing. But all in all, this is TD's most enjoyable late-'90s album. It's worth a listen, even for old fans who only like their early stuff."
4,It's an adapter...like what can you say?,"Uh...it's a stereo RCA jack to 1/8"" headphone/mic in jack. It's not rocket science here. The only remarkable thing about this is that it is very heavy-duty and solid. Expensive, but rugged."
2,Overpriced,"As many other Monster products, this piece is incredibly overpriced. Is it high quality? Yes. Is a similar item at Monoprice costing over $10 less of any noticeably different quality? Not at all. I don't work for monoprice, but once I found them, I have never bought another overpriced adapter/cable. All the experts on AV forums seem to agree with me."
4,"Nice shorts, just disappinted that there were no pockets","These shorts are nice, and fit well. I am only disappointed because they don't have any pockets."
5,hauntingly beautiful,"Excuse the use of such a cliche, but the West has finally met the East, and done so in a way that is truly brilliant. Not being a great supporter of Nusrat's attempts at ""Westernizing"" qawwalis, even I have to admit that Michael Brook succeeded in creating a tasteful mix that the great maestro himself was unable to master. Though largely devoid of the repetitive chants and driving rythms of a qawwali, this album still captures the hypnotic qualities of Nusrat's best work. His voice is set against a background of music that is rich but not over-powering. As Nusrat's voice flits from a deep, throaty groan to a clear, haunting wail, it becomes clear that he has truly transcended the barrier of language, and is able to convey pure, raw emotion through music alone. This is perhaps the best aspect of Night Song - being able to hear a voice so miraculous without the clutter that usually surrounds it in his other works. The end result - hauntingly beautiful."
3,mood music,"Like much of the music produced with heavy synthesizer backdrops, ""Night Song"" is essentially an album designed for mood and atmosphere, rather than intense musical evaluation. Where this album differs from ""Mustt Mustt"" is primarily in the handling of Nusrat's vocals. The earlier collaboration was actually a collaboration, with the backdrops designed to compliment the range of textures produced by Khan's voice. ""Night Song"", however, uses the Voice like just another sample on most tracks, coming in for awhile and then dropping out, giving way to stale breakbeats and synth washes. While I can't give this album a bad rating, I would say go for the first Brook/Khan project and especially Nusrat's recordings with his Qawwali Party."
2,Musical Tourism,"As a long-time fan of Nusrat Fateh Ali Can and his collaborations with Jan Garbarek and Massive Attack I listened to this record with high expectations. However, I felt that Michael Brooks was not sensitive enough to the rhythmic subtleties of the source music and this record was marred for me by a predictable and pedestrian approach to the songs especially in the rhythm section."
5,"the words seem to make english sense,no babbling brooke","On Night Song, the words are not english, (clearly), yet thereis a transcendence of words, especially in the mostsublime first song, which i recommend a person put intoan infinite re-play loop. it seems to say to me :'there is only love, it is very much....'gorgeous the way Brooke blends so cunningly and withsuch soul craft the western sounds.no one's done it this well since Shankar met Menuhinin ""East Meets West"". buy it and listen oftenand you will grow...."
5,"No wonder Peter Gabriel, Eddie Vedder are crazy about him!","Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's voice has often been considered the best ever! Although Fateh Ali Khan is a traditional Qawaali singer beyond compare, his repetoire of notes and absolute mastery over entire scale even in music blended with Western idioms inspire awe. Night Song is an album for those who wish to sample some of Fateh Ali Khan's magic without having to ""endure"" traditional Pakinstani or Indian music. (If you like this album, get the one called ""Sangam"" from Indian or Pakinstani stores.)"
4,"Refreshingly new, highly versatile.","The collection has a good mix of Hindi and Punjabi songs, with a melodious touch of western music. The music is quite different and melodious. Nusrat has proved yet again that he is a singer of great versatality, by singing soft numbers with as much passion as he sings his thundering qawaalis.A must have CD for a Nusrat fan."
5,MP3 / 50 Greatest Hits / Nusrat Fetah Ali Khan / $8.99,"This is not a review for this particular album. But, to get the word out, one never knows what one will find on Amazon, if you keep scouring the pages! I wanted a good introduction to the music of Nusrat Fetah Ali Khan. Like a lot of us, I became familiar with his work, through Peter Gabriel and Jeff Buckley. What I found by scrolling the Amazon pages was: MP3 DOWNLOAD / 50 GREATEST HITS / NUSRAT FETAH ALI KHAN / $8.99!!! Its over 10 and a half hours of this mans music! They do not seem to be excerpts either, as a lot of the selections clock in at over 20 minutes. The majority of them at 15 minutes. It would take a bit of work to find out what albums they originated from, but 10 and a half hours of this genius for 9 bucks, is a no-brainer! Check it out under MP3 Downloads, if you would like a grand introduction to this man's work.50 Greatest Hits Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan"
3,Good but not great,"Nusrat's qawwalis are always playing in my Pakistani family's household, and I'm a fan of so-called ""fusion"" music, so naturally I bought this CD upon its release many years ago. There are definitely some great tracks on this CD, such as ""My Comfort Remains"", but a lot of the album is on the verge of studio overproduction. I think the other collaboration with Michael Brook, ""Mustt Mustt"", is more subtle and palatable. Regardless, I'd still recommend this album if for anything Nusrat's voice being incredible as always."
3,"Fun, sometimes funny, Afro-pop","If you enjoy the music of other Afro-pop stars that have risen to popularity lately (i.e., Baaba Maal, Youssou N'Dour), you'll enjoy Papa Wemba.This disc is a popsy blend of African rhythms, guitars, and wailing vocals, and the charisma and style of Papa Wemba is infectious and entertaining. Just don't expect anything too deep from this album."
5,Emotion: Pure Joy,"I'm not much into genres or pigeon-holing, so all I can say is this album is pure joy to me. It makes me smile and dance around. I've listened to most of Papa Wemba's output, but this captures me the most (with Voyageur a close second).To me, springtime by the ocean, bright sunshine, clear blue sky, light breeze... this is the album. Period.Then, just as the sun has gone down I will put on ""Serious Tam"" by Telek."
1,Only supports 1 external monitor,"Only supports 1 external monitor (not 2). And that is VGA not DVI connection. HP 2530 has small screen, so the combination of that plus this limited docking station is a limitation."
4,"SMALL, BUT PROBABLY USEFUL","This little book is small but built to last a long time in FULL use. The photographs are quite good and the maps are reasonably useful - as far as I can determine - but I have not traveled most of the tours described in this book. I can actually only say that the book is well made, logically laid out, and probably useful for persons planning to follow the routes described. Once you are there, you may find better assistance in getting around."
3,a few more photographs would be nice,full of info so it is a good book to take with you on your tour of the coast but a few more photographs would be nice. just my two cents
4,Pretty good,"I used this book for the Astoria to Lincoln City section. It did direct me to a couple of places I simply would not have found. I'd buy it again, though it's not perfect. Surprisingly few photos. And a star rating, or a better indication of ""can't miss"" vs. ""just nice"" would offer the time-constrained traveler more guidance."
4,Photo vacation,Covers alot of ground and offers more photo op suggestions than one could ever hope to take in one visit. Used it extensively to plan a photography vacation on Highway 101.
4,"It's a mix bag, but overall, its a good try.","The introductions were a little sparse and a lot of the homosexuality was considerably downplayed, Ann's book does give language poetry and female Beats like Diane DiPrima much more space than they get in other Beat anthologies. In fact, much of the ""man's world"" that is Beat literature is balanced in this anthology. I admit, sometimes, when it comes to overviews of the American avant-garde, one is trading one whitewash for another.Anyway, this anthology devotes time to writers other than the big three of the Beats. Selections from Joanne Kyger, John Wieners, Diane Di Prima, and Lenore Kandel make this anthology well-worth its price despite its flaws."
1,homophobia unleashed,"Did you know that Burroughs was straight? Or Ginsburg? Yep -- not a word about their homoerotic interests, either in the poems selected (or oddly slashed up) or in the intros. We do find out that Orlovsky was Ginsburg's ""companion"" -- is this the year 1928? The editor evidently thinks so. Instead of providing an honest introduction to Beat work, she inflicts salacious, incredibly obscure pieces upon us, like a 6-page rant from Michael McClure about (and I quote) ""woman woman woman woman woman woman woman."" This anthology tells us a lot about the editor's personal idiosyncracies, but it is not a balanced portrayal of the Beats."
5,This is still #1,"Ann,# 1 biographer-with Gerald Nicosia, did the basics, then cam Rolling Stones' ""Book of the Beat'..'99..both-are inseparable pieces to the ""Beat"" heart..a distillation that cannot be surpassed..in this Century"" Lowell Celebrates Keoauc, 12th events..."
5,Smooth Rolling,"These are very nicely made die cast vehicles! My son loves them all, especially Sheriff and Red, and my husband and I admire the quality. They have a great weight to them and they roll very smoothly. Excellent toys!"
1,What a rip off,"Instead of advertising 1:55 scale - how about you just say 2 1/2 inch match box car for $20.00, then charge 19.00 for delivery because in the end the order form wouldn't let me order a less expensive type of delivery and you have a nearly $40.00 match box car. To say I was disappointed and felt ripped off would be an understatement. How many normal people can tell you what 1:55 scale means? I got the same thing from Disney for $4.99. I will never buy here again! 0 stars from me!"
1,Close but no cigar,"I started this book and the first red flag was the Scottish brogue dialogue that some of the characters spoke in. Way too much mental translation. I stayed with it for about 100 pages and just didn't enjoy it much further. I might pick it up later but the formula was obvious and the characters just didn't get my attention. Besides, that brogue accent stuff really got on my nerves."
1,Misrepresented this booklet,"I thought I was getting something more than what this was. It is a booklet of activites that a social studies teacher would give their students. For $12.00 I would have expected more, plus the seller overcharged for shipping. I am returning the booklet immediately."
5,Mother Power - Even if you already believe we are wonderful!,"Finally, a book that will help women to find (and use) the strength within them, whether they be running a household or mananging a corporation. With an effective combination of hard fact and psychological insight, Plumez takes the reader on an eye-opening journey of astonishing accomplishments of 'ordinary' women and helps us to believe that there is a wellspring of mother power within us all. As a mother and a psychologist, I was impressed with how well Plumez translates her obviously well researched material into practical 'how-to's' about how to find, develop, and use our maternal strength. I loved the book and bought ten copies to give to friends - for a special celebration of Mother's Day."
1,Obsolete- Don't buy it unless you have an old computer,"I just purchased this product (early 2005) and it does not work with the current OS (10.3). You can't even install it. The publisher will sell an upgrade of the core program if you don't mind doubling your price. Given that there are so few Mac bible software options available, this is a real disappointment."
4,THE 4th INSTALLMENT IN THE TRANCERS SERIES!!!!!!,Jack Deth returns meaner and better than ever.Although it can't beat the first three movies and espically PART III but this is okay too.Jack Deth is a future cop and kicks Trancers butts.Trancers are zombie-like creatures who want world destruction.But Jack suddenly ends up in an alternate dimension ruled by vampire-like Trancers.THE BACKGROUND IN THIS MOVIE LOOKS FAMILAR.THAT'S BECAUSE THE VLADILAS CASTLE from the Subspecies series is in the background.So I guess Jack is in Transylvania?
5,You must watch this movie 100 times,"I admit I've seen this movie more than the average person, but this is no average movie. The bar scene alone rivals such films as: Top Gun, Roadhouse, and The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Admittedly, not many people have seen any of the Trancers movies, but those who have can appreciate its utter brilliance. Great lines from Tim Thomerson like, ""Lady I am tough,"" and ""Your probably just another dizzy b**** from Melrose... Shopping all day,"" make this flick classic. If you show me someone who doesn't think Jack Deth is the sweetest character alive, I'll show you a fruitcake who's probably better off watching re-runs of The Nanny. If you like Trancers, also check out The Castlefreak"
3,This movie is acceptional.,"The 4th of the TRANCERS series is okay, a pretty good story line, special effects, action, and a little bit of humor makes this movie good."
5,Best in the series!,Start here. The others are great to have but this one is the most valuable. Save this one in a house fire.
1,"Avoid. There are better, more enjoyable anthologies.","Avoid this CD.Historically it is accurate and the selections are representative and important. The quality of the recordings are very good.However, I did not find any of the tracks enjoyable, or anything I would want to listen to again, or explore further. This is not the case with OHM- The Early Gurus of Electronic Music for example. I listen to the OHM CD regularly and have expanded my appreciation and knowledge of this music, which I love, from the selections in the OHM collection.I will be selling these CD's immediately, or using them as coasters."
1,A Little Mix Up,"The ISBN number for this book is actually for a book with the same title and by the same author, but a book having different stories in it. If you take look inside this book, you'll see right away that the cover presented to you looks different. Further investigation reveals that the stories inside the book are not those mentioned by the other reviewers. In short, if you're looking for Milton Crane's ""50 Great Stories"", ISBN 0553277456, this is not it."
1,DIAPPOINTING,"I don't like most foreign writers, stories in foreign countries and stories by women writers--they're all so slow and boring-- so I was really disappointed with the first story Garden Party. The next is by Hemingway, who to me is not that great a writer because he can go on and on with useless conversations and little movement or action by the characters.It's my own fault, I let my choices be influenced by the Amazon policy of ""Buy 3, get the 4th free."" This policy does not include many books; you must select from a limited list. And I will never be duped again, I can tell you that."
4,Good,The book Is pretty used but it is very good for its price. It was also shipped pretty fast so I got it right on time.
4,good,"This is a good anthology for those who love to read but never get the time to read an entire novel or lengthy short story. It has some very nice pieces in it and a fair variety. For a quick read, a book to throw in your bag on the way to the doctor's office, or for someone wanting to renew their interest in the short story, I would recommend this."
5,The Apex of American short stories.,"This collection is actually rather good. It basically covers the best short stories written in America over the passed century. All the hits! Personally, I keep my favorites on my website at [...] Check it out! Anyway, this is a worthwhile collection to purchase!"
3,Fancy Short Stories,"This is a really good book of stories. A lot of them seem to hold more promise or insight than I can appreciate (I do not have the breathe of literature education or culture that it takes to understand all the subtle insights). I really enjoyed ""The Ghosts"" by Lord Dunsany: it had such a way with words describing the fire in the fireplace, etc. But the main interest in these stories is in the society and culture they describe. There is so much that we do know about our history that is spoken of in these stories. ""In the Committee Room"" by James Joyce is a pretty good everyday sort of experiences of some fellows in Dublin, but maybe there is something I missed."
4,Very helpful!,Just reading the table of contents helped me realize my son was normal which lowered my anxiety and built my patience.
4,Basic but good,"This is a really good book for understanding how a child learns and perceives their world. I like how the book was broken up into sections so that it didn't need to be read from to back. It's a good reminder that as parents we are teachers all the time and have a big responsiblities. I would recommend this book to anyone with preschoolers, especially before a child becomes a preschooler."
5,A Dream Set Heard Absolutely Live,"Recorded on April 23, 1997, in Zabreze, Poland, for a fan club release, the nine tracks encompass the second half of the European Tour's concert set.With no mixing or overdubs, the listener is hearing TD as if part of the audience, which is a huge plus. The electronics of Edgar and Jerome Froese are augmented by guitarist Zlatko Perica and Emil Hachfeld on percussion/codotronics.This is a solid set, with a soundscape that builds to a stunning climax. In a vast catalog of great hits and hideous misses, the live album is tremendous."
5,Success!!!!,"I ordered this to try in an attempt to get a very picky elderly dog to eat. She would only eat every other day in spite of my cooking for her. Lost a lot of weight, is skin and bones. This stuff has her eating 3x a day...I poured some over the doggy meatloaf or chicken I make for her and she eats everything. I will see if her weight goes up, but I assume with her intake more than quadrupled, she should get some meat on her bones. So far, so good. Thanks for a great product."
2,my dog wouldn't touch it,"I can't really rate the quality or effectiveness of this product as my dog wouldn't have anything to do with it. She is aging and getting very thin. She is a light and picky eater, so I was trying to find a way to get some extra calories in. All the reviews about the finicky dog devouring this sounded great, but my dog wouldn't eat it in her food, or lick it off my finger. When I touched a smidge to her lips to get her to taste it she was VERY put out."
2,"For ""Pets"", ""animals"", but SURPRISE, NOT FOR CATS!",I read all the comments and information and then purchased this for a cat that is having trouble eating. I feed him baby food meats but thought this might help.It wasn't until I received the bottle that I could read...on the bottle...that it is not recommended for cats and kittens.I would love to have read this before I ordered the item: it is very important to specify this fact.
3,Early Wolfe: works well despite the rough edges,"A nice complex mystery, one of Wolfe's better stunts, and Archie in full annoyance mode, makes THE RED BOX a nice addition to the Wolfe oeuvre. Whenever Wolfe leaves the office, bad things are bound to happen, but having to go to a fashion designer's workplace, albeit at the request of some of NY's top orchid growers, to investigate a murder, makes Wolfe more than a little grumpy and things go from bad to worse. As this is an early Wolfe mystery fans will find a few things not in line with the later more polished work; Archie lacks the sophistication we see later in the series and there is particularly unfortunate episode of police brutality that accepted as par for the course by all parties involved. But it is a good mystery with a few more twists than some of the more formulaic Wolfe stories."
5,One of the best,"Stout in his prime with Archie and Nero grooved into their characters, very fast pacing and one of the best plots in the series."
4,a classic favorite,"There's nothing more classic than a black and white pair of chuck high tops. I've worn them since I was a kid and I'm not about to stop now.I buy a pair every few years and wear them until they are literally falling apart around my feet.As much as I love the look of a brand new clean pair of chucks, I also have a special place in my heart for a beaten, battered, torn up, scribbled on, dirty, scuffed up pair. It's all part of the life cycle of a pair of Chuck Taylors.The basic colors also hold a special place in my heart. I can't walk into journey's anymore because all the shoes in there look like a clown took acid and threw up all over the place. Who can sell me shoes that don't make me look an a-hole? I'll stick to the classics.I gave a 4 star review, however, because it upsets me that these shoes have become so expensive. They can't possibly cost anywhere near that much to make. There's not much to them and that's what I like."
3,Took Seriously Forever,"I bought the shoes for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loved them, I couldn't be happier with the style and neither could he. The only problem was the shipping! I ordered them a month before his birthday and was worried I wouldn't get them in time. It took almost a month for them to be delivered."
5,Great Stuff,"First I must add that artist name is Ayako Hosokawa with an o not a as Amazon has in their database. This CD is one of fameous records from Three Blind Mice recordings made by XRCD process, in a few words a must for hi fi fanatics. This is her first album ( she has done 3 since), sample of jazz and some rock standards, all with one purpose: to show her great vocal capabilities. Acompanied with great jazz musicians from Japan of that time (1977) such as Tsuyoshi Yamamoto on piano and Shoji Yokouchi on guitar makes this CD even better. For the record track listing is : 1. Wrap Your Troubles In Dream 2.Misty 3. Our Love Is Here To Stay 4. My Foolish Heart 5. Bridge Over Trouble Water 6. When You Smile 7. Mr. Wonderfull 8. Feel Like Makin' Love 9. The Lady Is A Tramp"
2,Sounds great...but not so much,"Very cheaply made...the clip that attachs to your belt is very difficult to get attached to the cover. The wristband is just a short length of velcro that you can buy anywhere. However, the actual MP3 cover fits very well, doesn't slip, and allows good access to the buttons and ports."
4,"Skin Kit, Belt Clip/Sports Armband","The Skin Kit worked well, I haven't used the belt clip/armband yet."
4,"Great case, okay price.","This case is perfect. It's compact, and fits the sansa perfectly. All the buttons can easily be pressed with the case on. The scroll wheel might be difficult to use with this case only if you have very large fingers. For me it's fine. It's also feels nice, and keeps clean. I haven't used the armband or belt-clip. Both hook in through a slot in the back of the case, and I'm afraid it will permanently stretch the strap it feeds through.The price is very expensive. I didn't buy this item here, I bought it on eBay for ten bucks with screen protectors included. The screen protectors fit it well, and are a must for preventing scratches. I think this comes with a screen protector though. If price isn't an issue, definitely buy it for your sansa. If it is, shop around and buy this case elsewhere. I'm convinced this is the only good case, all the others seem flimsy, or too bulky."
3,Good Idea but too fragile,"I received the silicone sking kit yesterday and after I put it, I notice that between the lock switch and the headphones out the silicone skin is weak and breaking as a consecuence. I don't know how much it is going to last, I hope that it will be enough to justify the inversion that I made.Leaving that aside, I think that the skin is great, suits excelent and improves the handling of the buttons next to the ring which are difficult to press otherwise."
2,I must have a different model from everyone else,"I must have a different model from everyone else. The so called screen protector is a clear piece of plastic. It has little paper tabs glued to which said remove before or after application. But the things are glued on so tightly that I still haven't been able to get them off! I'm very disappointed. It's not worth the price, especially since I paid more for shipping than the case itself."
5,On Par with the Eisenhorn Series,"I've read almost every Warhammer 40k novel out there, and I have to say that this ranks as the most in-depth experience a reader can ever take into the Warhammer 40k universe. Abnett has reached a new level in his writing style, making it virtually impossible to put this book down. It has all of the action of the Eisenhorn Trilogy and presents it in a way that makes the reader feel as if he or she is walking alongside the characters. For readers familiar with Abnett's previous Eisenhorn novels, Ravenor takes place several decades after Hereticus and follows the exploits of Inquisitor Ravenor as he investigates the spread of a new type of drug called 'flects'. Several favorite characters from the Eisenhorn series have also been included in this novel, which is a big plus. I suggest reading the Eisenhorn Trilogy before this novel but even first time readers can get an appreciation for this incredible tour through the Imperium of Mankind."
3,Lines/ hoses are too short for an SUV,"I had to purchase new plastic lines/hoses because the ones included are way too short. Any SUV is taller than a car and the dipstick is back against the firewall. I had to go to an industrial supply house and purchased 8 foot lines/hoses. I spend a ton of gas money driving around the city to find ones that would work. Even if I did have a small car, they would have still been too short. Do they want you to stand on a ladder and do it?"
3,disappointed,"It works like it says it does, but I can't manage to get the tubing down my dipstick tube far enough to remove more than two quarts in my F150."
4,Works great with BMW 3; but not with Honda CRV,"Works beautifully with the Bimmer, but need the Lisle Oil Filter socket for sure.The evacuator though simple, can use a more thorough instruction to explain the drain plug (kind of stuck in there blocking the drain, but removable).Didn't work with Honda CRV. Didn't find any reference in previous reviews. But the Honda drain plug is easy to do; though not the oil filter.I would buy it for just the Bimmer."
3,Cracked suction tube,The largest of the three suction tubes was creased and cracked where it was bent to ship. I have not used evacuator yet.
3,Be careful,"This makes change the oil a breeze, but remember that you still have to change the oil filter, so unless you have an easily accessible oil filter, I would re consider buying this.European cars are the best fit for the intended use of this evacuator.A problem I encounter is that the straw seem to keep falling and leaves a mess if you don't clean it up fast. I found this extremely disappointing, maybe they should have a lock mechanism to avoid this.Overall its great, but not for every car. (some you just have to get underneath anyways.)"
2,No Warranty,"I was thinking of buying this evacuator but was concerned by some comments about it not working with synthetic oils. I contacted Lincoln Industrial, who manufacture the Mityvac and they told me they had tested the unit with synthetic oils and did not have any problems. However, they also told me that they do not honor the Mityvac's warranty if bought from Amazon. I emailed Amazon about this and they are ""investigating"". I was certainly not aware that Amazon sold ""gray market"" products."
4,"Had a defective one, Mityvac delivered","I used this on my 2002 BMW and it seemed to work great, but the next time I went to use it- oil started coming out of the T-Handle where air normally is the only thing that escapes. I called the manufacturer, and they advised me that a defect is allowing the seals in the lower part of the canister to degrade and will allow oil to bypass. They informed me that it would be covered under warranty- but Tool Topia is not working with me. When you call the line for returns, they have you leave a message- nobody ever calls you back either. I have called 4 times in the last 6 days- and nothing.**UPDATE** After Mityvac heard my story, they offered to send me another unit right away!Don't buy this from ToolTopia (Amazon's seller of this unit)"
5,Worth Every Penny,"This item was worth every dime. The other reviews that say it doesn't work, I'm not sure why they would say that. My method: I drove the car home, so it was hot. I went in, waited about an hour, went back out, sucked every bit of the oil out within moments. I have a BMW and can now change my oil in my dress clothes If I wanted to. It's great. No more lying on the floor, no more getting filthy, no more excuses not to change your oil.Also, the more expensive model with the 'reversability' so you can pump the oil out, I don't know why you would need that? This one, you simply pour it out. Easy. You won't regret this."
2,2 units arrived broken,"This seems like a nice unit. fairly solid, looks like it should be just fine. Except for the fact that it arrived with small cracks arount the screws that hold the top on the unit. It looked like they may have been over tightened during assembly. this is despite there being a sticker that said tighten screws before using. I sent it back Amazon returned it and had a new one at my door pronto. This was great but this has the same small cracks around a few of the screws. the cracks almost look like they were molded in, but are definitely cracks. Ugh."
4,Mityvac 7400 evacuator,"Very good product for normal use. I work for an a automotive shop and weuse the same model. Once in a while on some cars, I do more pumping thanother ones. If you don't want to get dirty, the evacuator is the way to go."
2,great idea but it don't work,"I like the idea of this product but the tube that is supplied does not fit all the way down into the dip stick tube of my car. Maybe it can only be used on specific model cars, but the product does not indicate that any where. Any ways check your car before purchasing."
1,Piece of junk,"Add me to the list of people who got ONE use out of this piece of junk. The next time around, oil was POURING (not dripping, or leaking, but STREAMING) out of the handle, leaving me with a HUGE mess to clean up and some tricky hazardous waste to dispose of. THANKS!"
1,Failed right out of the box,"This device was a failure right out of the box. All the screws were loose, and even once tightened, the pump got only a measly 12 ounces of oil from the crankcase. It would not develop a vacuum as stated in the instructions. Amazon referred me to the manufacturer. If considering buying this pump, be ready for frustration."
5,Works Great,It seems that my dealer overfills my car every time I take it in. This works great for taking the 1/2 quart out. 5 Minutes and I am done.
3,punping for oil,"I had high hopes this devise would make my oil changing job easier but as i found it really can't be done. The instructions were no help in the initial set up and start of the proceedure. I had to learn what i needed to do as i went along. The main complaint i had was that the tubes that came with the pump were not long enough to get the tube all the way to the bottom of the oil pan. This was while trying to punmp out the oil from a 350 mercury i/o bouat motor. Now i am going to try and find some longer tubes to use for my boat and car. In the boat motor it left about a quart of old oil in the engin. It was very well made but the tubes were the biggesst problem. Also, the tube kinked at the inlet to the resivor."
2,Mityvac 7400: it sucks because it doesn't suck,"I bought this product for use on a BMW 330i. I tested it in a sink to be sure it would work (no problems). When I attempted to use it to vacuum the oil, it hardly sucked out more than a cup of oil. I warmed up the engine (who knows if it wasn't warm enough?). The hose was so short I had to hold the unit on top of the engine (very awkward to try to pump that way). I tried both tubes thinking maybe one or the other would produce a better result; neither was better than the other. In the end I just packed the unit up and sent it back. I also found it nearly impossible to remove that plug thing that joins the hose to the unit; I'm guessing dumping used oil with that plug blocking the spout would have been nightmarish as well. I contacted the Customer Service and it took 3 days for them to contact me (pretty poor, IMO)."
4,Easy to use,"Worked well for changing transmission fluid. Easy to pump and extract fluid. I wish the tubing were longer: The unit has to be upright to hold the fluid and the hose attaches to the top of the unit, requiring the tubing to pull a u-turn and go down the side of the unit before getting to the top of the engine (unless you have enough room in the engine compartment of your car to set the extractor next to the engine - ha!)."
1,Dissapointed,Used it twice and now it doesn't work. I did see mixed reviews and ordered it anyway. I just hoped I would get a good one. I guess I didn't.
1,Seals poorly !,"I used this ONE time to remove oil from my van. When I went to use it just 3 days later on my other car, it would not extract transmission fluid.The plastic fitting that connects to the top of the unit was sucking air, so it would not create a vacuum. I had to stuff a circular piece of paper napkin between the fitting and the opening to get it to seal and work somewhat.After the first use the unit was rinsed with a mild solvent and cleaned as per the instructions. The oil I extracted from the van was NOT synthetic (see someone else's review on that subject). I now need to find the correct size O-ring to replace the defective,leaky original.The fitting should be of the threaded type and not a press fit that becomes leaky in a short time! Not much quality for $70+..."
4,"Works Pretty Good, Saves Time and Money","Recently bought the Mityvac 7400 because the dealer wanted $150 for an oil change on my SLK230. In order to pull the drain plug its jack up the car (put on stands) remove a skip pan and dust shield then on to the plug. The Mityvac worked great (I need to develop a little bit better technique) but it did a great job getting the oil out the dipstick. The pouring spout makes it easy to transfer the used oil for disposal. Because it is dedicated to oil changes a wipe down does the clean up. I had so much fun I changed the oil on my wife's Grand Cherokee, while I was at it."
1,Disappointed,"I loved this unit when it was new, but now after a year, not as much. Seems there is a problem with the seals when used with synthetic oil. Oil now sprays out of exhaust hole near T-handle."
3,It does the Job,"It should be cheaper, It's materials looks cheap (made in China)but it does the job as it is described i used it for lawn mower and my cars.."
4,Pretty sweet,"This oil extractor saves a ton of time. It sucks the entire 3.5 quarts out of my Prius in about 3 to 5 minutes. I know that it's getting nearly everything out of the pan because I put 3.5 quarts back in, and that brings the level right to the full line. You still have to change the filter, but I can catch the drips from that in a gladware container instead of a huge oil pan! If you have a European-style canister filter mounted on top of the engine, you're even better off!I have had no problems with leaks, and the vacuum is very strong. You only have to pump the air out once to drain the entire pan.If I were buying one again, I would get the model that allows you to pump fluids back out. Tipping the evacuator to fill containers for recycling can be messy, unless you're very careful. If you're buying this in order to save yourself a hassle, consider the reversible MityVac model :)."
3,Mityvac does not honor warranties from Amazon.com,"I discovered a broken seal on my 7400 and called Mityvac to get somewarranty information. Found out they do not honor warranties frompurchaes off of Amazon.com They only honor from distributors websites.Just be forewarned. The cheap amazon cost might be more in the long run,which is what i found out.-Sean"
2,OK with some cars,"This extractor worked OK with my Volkswagen, but it did not seem to get all the oil out. However, it would not work at all with my Buick. I could not get the tube far enough down the dipstick to extract any oil."
3,Needs longer tubes,Love the pump. The pump feels like it is high quality and holds more than enough for an oil change. I just pumped it a few times and walked away. The engine was pumped clean when I came back.But the tube is too short to reach the mityvac when it is on the floor next to the car. I had to duct tape two of the hoses together to reach. This seems like a strange oversight.
1,poor quality - no longer working,"After using a few times, it no longer worked. Oil actually leaked out below the handle when I used it. I would not recommend this product."
4,"Easy to use, great product","I bought this to change oil on a Mercedes C230 as it is recommended per the manufacturer to change oil from the top as opposed to traditional oil changes from the pan. The product works well and creates suction instantly once you have the tube down the dipstick into the crankcase. I found that the tube was not long enough for the reservoir to sit on the ground with the tube inserted so I had to use a stool to rest it on while I pumped and drained the oil. It was certainly different than what I'm used to but very effective and less potential mess than a normal oil change. After you are done the pour spout is great for draining into containers for recycling used oil. I have not taken off the top to clean the inside as I was in a rush, but I don't see that being any more difficult the operation of the device."
1,Leaks oil out of handle after one use,"Worked fine removing oil on day one. On day two, oil leaked out of handle right away. Huge mess. As with others reporting the same thing, it's going right back to Amazon. Now I'm looking for a better pump and it won't be a Mityvac."
5,Excellent! Appears to be improved design,"This is a time, grime and back saver! I was able to change the engine oil on my E38 BMW in 30 minutes without jacking the car up and crawling underneath (the oil filter is replaceable from the upper engine compartment). I read the previous reviews and it looks like the manufacturer has listened to the complaints and fixed the problems:1. The tubes are sturdier and don't soften and collapse when the oil is at normal engine operating temperature2. No leaks with full synthetic oil3. The tube tip is cut at an angle so it doesn't ""cling"" to the oil pan bottomThis is one of those ""why didn't I do this earlier?"" buys!"
4,"Good product overall , takes some effort to clean, hoses may get stuck.","Nice product which simplifies your life and makes changing oil much less messy. It is fairly straightforward to get it going and start pumping out oil in no time. Cleaning this up is not so easy though.Top part is not easily removable, so I used some degreaser to spray insides and rinse off. Cleaning up those hoses is not easy too and I would much rather prefer a one time use hose solution.Be careful pushing the hose inside your engine too hard. I changed oil on my Mercedes without any issues, but when I used it on my wife's Subaru small hose banded and got stuck inside the engine. I pulled it out after jerking and pulling for about 20min , but that scared me a lot."
2,Died after 2 years,"Worked OK when it did, which was about 2 years. I must have used it less than 10 times during those 2 years. Then it started leaking, sputtering oil through the handle. The manufacturer said the seals went bad and that it was not repairable."
4,Great Products for the Money,"I have done Oil change for many years the old fashion way..Man what a different. I don't have to set up any ramp,jack the car up or crawl under the car any more, (maybe with the exceptions of changing the oil filter of the cars that has the filter underneath).But my German make car's filter are up on top so it is that much easier I just pop the hood and a few pump later and it is done. The only thing is that I still have to do is get under the car to get the oil filter out. ... Overall this products got me to change my oil on my 4 vehicles..in less 2 hours including a small clean up and change tube for different vehicle."
4,Mityvac 7400 Fluid Evacuator,Works great! I ordered this item to change the oil in my wife's new Volvo and avoid the hassle of having to crawl under the car (it has a top mounted oil filter). The Mityvac arrived promptly with no damage; the directions were well written; and within an hour I was changing oil. About 5 pumps removed half the oil and another 5 pumps finished the process. The unit is simple but very well made and a genuine bargain at Amazon's price (with free shipping). The dealer wanted $150 for the 15K service. I completed the job in 30 minutes and barely got my hands dirty. Thanks Amazon!
2,Thought it would be easy to use.,The oil leaks out from the handle and makes a lot of mess. The plastic tube got stuck in my dipstick which resulted in a $500.00 bill from my local shop.Seemed like a good idea at the time but not impressed with this product. Although other people have had better luck.
2,Worked OK for awhile,Used this item for a short time and then it started leaking oil into the pmp. I contacted the manufacture and was given no consideration. No customer service for a problem item. Avoid-buy a better brand.
2,Don't use this more than 1 year,"Good white it lasted, but after just over a year (stored indoors), the Mityvac 7400 developed a leak in two areas that rendered the unit useless.FIRST LEAK:This occurred between the handle and the metal downpipe. Oil would literally flow out during a single pump. Messy.SECOND LEAK:This leak is almost as bad as the first. It occurs at the hole on the cap where the metal downpipe goes into the unit. Again, oil leaks out of it.When you combine the both leaks, it's a horrible mess! When I called Mityvac, their response made it seem like they had heard this before. It seems like there's no development in the product to resolve this problem. A known issue has been ignored. I'd recommend you turn to another competing product if you want something more reliable."
1,Leaks oil at handle,"I used this several times with my car, quad, motorcycle and itworked great.About a month later went to use it again and oil startssquirting out of the t-handle where only air should come out.I read where another user had the same problem and the manufacturersaid some brands of synthetic oil causes the seal to break down.Well give me a break, synthetic is here to stay, I was using itwith AMSOIL.Don't buy this product, its useless after it starts leaking andafter taking it apart there is know way to replace a seal.In the junk it goes!"
1,crap,"The handle broke after five minutes of use. i was able to rethread the shaft and get it working again but what a piece of goat ass this thing is. Mitivac, please make your products less terrible in the future."
3,Not bad but has areas of improvement.,"Not as easy to use as I originally thought. It does provide a convenient way to change your oil but you have to do a lot of maneuvering to get it to clean out the oil pan and a lot of hand pumping. The product is solid through, easy to maintain and built well."
2,"Worked for 1 1/2yr, then stopped sucking","Used only for oil changes on Mobil1 full synthetic 0w-40.Worked great at first, would suck 7qts of oil out in about 10 minutes without it being warmed up. Then slowly over a year it would take longer and longer, up to 20-30 minutes of endless pumping. It seemed as if a seal somewhere was going. If I kept pumping the flow would continue but as soon as I stopped there was no vaccuum left to keep pulling.I took it apart and cleaned all the seals I could get to which helped a little bit it never worked as quickly as it had initially. It went out with the trash this morning."
5,Scholarly work on an advanced topic,"I have a great deal of interest in the document object model, as it is the basis of HTML and XML documents. Anyone interested in working with HTML, XML, DHTML in an advanced way should read this book and learn from it. This isn't a book for people with a passing interest in slapping together Web pages in Front Page, but it will give you a solid knowledge of the advanced topics of DOM manipulation using JavaScript.The book starts with some solid theory and explanation of the DOM API, but quickly moves to some practical examples, such as some useful debugging tools, and some HTML interface components (popup menus, in-place list editing) which will get you off on the right foot thinking about how you can implement your own interface elements. That's really the strongest aspect of the book -- getting you to think in new ways."
5,Will the kids ever see each other again?,"Judd and Lionel are desperately trying to get back home to Vicki and the others. They can't ever seem to, and this time they run into unbelievers, searching for believers without the mark. Will they ever make it home? And will the kids back at the Dial hideout stay or face the strange warning? Follow the kids through the toughest period in history. This is a good book, it kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting Book #35, The Rise of False Messiahs (this book is now available, along with Book #36, Ominous Choices.) The recommended ages for these books are ages 10-14. I've liked this series and it's very informative about the rapture, the Tribulation, and the Great Tribulation."
5,susie q,"this is a fantastic little reference guide for all parents who wish to provide wholesome reading resources for their children ages 3-30!! the book breaks into different historical eras, and lists suitable and highly recommended fiction and non-fiction titles for various age groups within each era. Most titles are available at the public library. the booklet also has a system of symbols which denote ""christian"" titles, easy to find titles, etc. etc. Especially good for homeschool families. I have relied upon this booklet many times to find just the right book to correspond with what we are studying at home. I originally received the book from a homeschooling friend, who purchased it from Elijah Company for $3.50. Too bad it's so hard to find. get a copy, if you can!"
2,Blues Brothers Complete,I do not know if I like it or not. I still do not have it. I orederd before xmas ... Just waiting :(
5,Great CD set,"I purchased this for my father, he loves the songs on the cd (set). I'm glad this cd was an option for purchase."
4,"Good collection, questionable CD quality.","This Blues Brothers collection has most of the music that Blues Brothers fans are looking for. The CD plays well in standard CD players, but some of the tracks would not play on my computer CD drive. Other than this glitch this CD is a great collection of music from the movie."
4,"Good collection, questionable quality.","This is a great collection of music from the Blues Brothers movie that includes most, if not all, the tracks that fans are seeking. The CD sounds great in standard CD players, but some of the songs would not play on my computer CD drive which plays all other CDs without difficulty. Other than that glitch the CD is a worthy collection."
2,Hard Read,"The book is really over my head. I'm much too uneducated for this read. Given the subject matter, I can understand some of the vocabulary is not going to be common every day language. But there is too many big words for me. I find the author much too pedantic."
5,One of the best autobiographies I've read,"Michael McClean is one of my favorite songwriters. That said, he is remarkably candid in his autobiography - something that makes this book well worth the money to buy, and well worth the time to read. He composed many of the most widely recognized commercial themes you've heard on TV. As for his songs, well, it's quite obvious that he uses his songs as his ""journal"". A wonderful insight to a remarkable and gifted man, whose songs have been there to lift me at many of my own most difficult times. Thanks for writing this, Michael!"
3,Sibling Rivalry Run Amok,"Not much really happens in ""Little Sister,"" a somewhat strange novel about, not surprisingly, a little sister living in the shadows of her dramatic and gorgeous older sister.What seems like your prototypical teen romance between gawky narrator Cindy Halley and popular jock Ron Peters takes a bizarre turn when Cindy suspects that Ron is really interested in her sister Christine, his costar in the school's production of Romeo and Juliet. Naturally, beneath Christine's confident exterior lies a vulnerability that ultimately reconnects her to her estranged younger sister and solves the mystery of Christine's secretive behavior.Unfortunately, the novel's tidy resolution still resonates a bit of ickiness at the revelation that 17 year old Christine has been sneaking around with a 23 year old man."
3,Competent but unexciting documentary,"Antarctica Dreaming is a competently produced documentary, but nothing extraordinary. While informative and well shot, this production left a lot to be desired. The narrator's voice is dull, monotone, and wooden. The entire production seemed very mechanical and lacked soul.If you've had your fill of penguins and walruses over the last few years due to all the documentaries and animations, it's better off to skip this DVD entirely. This is nothing you haven't seen before. In light of the other much more superior penguin/Antarctic animal documentaries produced, like March of the Penguins, or the BBC Planet Earth series, your money is better spent there.Bad Extras:The extras include six mini-documentaries. The rest of the options lead to a still screen with text descriptions."
2,One of my biggest dissapoints in years.,"I like Paradise Lost a lot, but this album sucked. Why? Because the band did a no-no and sold out. Probably one of the biggest Sell-Outs in recent times (right behind Metallica). One question for Nick - Did James Hetfield give you singing lesson, because you used to have one of the coolest voices in Music."
4,Paradise Lost make a big change in sound; not quality,"With the release of One Second, Paradise Lost continue the progression they have made from album one. Not content to stay in a death metal pigeonhole, Paradise Lost have finally transformed themselves into the gothic rock band they have always hinted they were.Say Just Words gives the listener a taste of old Paradise Lost but do not be surprised by what else you hear. Paradise has lightened their sound on this one, preferring to move to a more mood oriented sound. They probaby saw all the copycat bands of their style and decided the time had come for a change. Certainly the new material doesn't kick with the same force as Draconian Times but it is their first step in a new direction and a welcome change for older fans. I look forward to seeing where they take this new sound."
1,"This wasn't just change, but rather a complete nosedive...","As an old fan of Paradise Lost, I have agree with those condemning the album. I'd say they completely ceased being any sort of ""metal"" with this album. That in itself isn't a bad thing - my tastes are much more diverse than that - but with it, they tossed out the grand melodrama that made them a great band. Still singing signature gloomy lyrics, but suddenly to simplistic uninspired rock melodies that sound almost devoid of any emotion or character at all.I have every album Paradise Lost has released, and One Second is, imho, thier worst album of all, despite going even lighter and more electronic with thier next offering."
1,Somebody kidnapped the REAL Paradise Lost,"Paradise Lost has gotten softer and softer with every album and now they have fallen to the point of shaving cream. This is so soft that REM puts out heavier riffs. The drums are now fake, the lyrics are shallower than a puddle in Egypt, and the vocals are as clean as a frat boy. This is a terrible release by what was a great band. Don't buy this c.d. (get _Shades of God_ or _Icon_)."
4,Note: 3-prong plugs,"I needed 2-prong plugs, but the photo here wasn't clear. These 3-prong plugs aren't what I needed, but I'll find a use for them.Here are the 2-prong plug adapters I really needed: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UE7SC8/"
4,Upbeat Beat,"I really don't seem to find some great feel good songs in the industry right now. Nevertheless, there is always a surpriser that does come out. For Joss Stone, she really pulled a down to Earth rabbit out of her hat. Her song, Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin' On Me), the second track from her debut album, The Soul Sessions is a very soulful and upbeat pop song. It really is just one of the ose feel good songs that you really don't find anymore. The song is much better than her first single, Fell In Love With A Boy. The song is really very groovy, and just easy to dance to. This is the kind of groove that Joss needs to keep making, a feel-good vibe. It isn't there a from a a lot of others right now."
4,Stone Love,"This Joss Stone single is valuable for the live version of James Brown's ""It's A Man's Man's Man's World"". Ms. Stone gives an impassioned and power reading of this outstanding track. Her vocals are powerful and she shows that she can command the stage as well as the studio. Surprisingly, ""Super Duper Love"" was picked as a single as it is one of the weaker tracks on the album."
4,not what you expect,"I ordered the Shelcore stacking cups hoping to receive 7 very simple, yet sturdy stacking cups for my 11 month old. However, what we received were 4 bulky stacking cups that make noise and light up. While my son loves them, they are not the simple product that I ordered and want. Apparently Shelcore changed the design of their stacking cups, but the photo and item description were not changed to reflect the new product."
4,I wish I would have bought it sooner!,"I bought this toy for my son's 1st birthday and I wish I would have bought it sooner. He really loves it! I think it would be great for any baby 6 months and up. It plays music too! You push the star and a few different tunes play. Two of the cups make noise, they have little beads in them and one of the cups you can twist it and it makes noise. My son loves these! It is a toy that he goes back to again and again. I am very pleased! It's a must have!"
1,Bad Advice,"This book offers a short-sighted, self-involved set of ""insights"" about teaching. There is very little focus here on the most important person in the process - the learner. Mr. Clark may be a fine teacher but HIS WAY may not be authentic for many, perhaps most, teachers. Good teachers know that our work cannot be summed up in any precise list of must do's and a real educator would not even think to create such a list for others to follow. It's a shame that a publisher of educational resources didn't tune in to this - preferring instead to indulge this self-promoter and his limited, superficial ideas."
2,Huh?,"I understand that we are all different, but my mind just can't grasp this guy. He dances around like he has ants in his pants and calls it teaching. I find it highly embarrassing to even witness someone wiggling around like that in front of an audience, and would only ever feel like laughing or participating out of sheer pity for the guy. It is an insult to the idea of education that he has to turn academic content into a flamboyant feely-fest. I was always more concerned with actual learning than with dancing around like a buffoon. And 55 ""essential"" rules? How incredibly arbitrary. 99.9999 percent of teachers in this world are not nearly overzealous enough to adopt this insane system."
5,A superb guide for students,"Ron Clark offers 55 essential practical strategies for students to function successfully in and out of the classroom. He deserves the aclaim he has received for this book. Lewarning etiquette, self-respect and consideration for others are necessary ingredients for a good life. I also suggest Optimal Thinking: How to be Your Best Self, written by an award-winning teacher, Dr. Rosalene Glickman. Optimal Thinking has been translated into many languages and is used in schools throughout the world to teach students how to be their best, master their emotions, make the most of any situation and achieve their most important goals. Buy these books and read every page."
2,"All hype, nothing solid","As a well-seasoned teacher, I was excited when I heard about this book, thinking it would be a terrific way to get new teachers better prepared for their classroom. Instead, this book has less to do with actual teaching than it does with massaging the author's ego. It is amazing that at such a young age and low level of classroom experience that this fellow thinks so highly of himself and his techniques. Nearly all of his ""essentials"" deal with what should be taught in the home. Also, few, if any, of his ""essentials"" deal with the learning process, learning strategies, differentiated classroom, etc., and will serve to impede rather than empower students.Give this guy credit though, he had a great PR campaign behind him and achieved something that most teachers never do; make money."
4,Good read for parents too,"The subtitle of this book is misleading -- this really is a book of etiquette rules, rather than a book about teaching techniques. The only direct impact Clark's rules have on teaching is that they (presumably) lead to better behavior in the classroom and they help children develop discipline and self-esteem. That said, this book makes a lot of sense for both parents and teachers, reminding us of the value of old-fashioned manners, and helping parents have some sense of their children's teachers' perspectives. I don't know how you could really dislike this book, because Clark's enthusiasm is so infectious."
1,Good behavior does not equal critical thinking,"As an educator and a parent, I was interested in finding out how to better teach my students and children to be thinkers, evaluaters, analysts, etc. Higher level cognitive skills are essential for success at school, at home, and eventually, in the ""real world"" of the workplace and so on. However, this book does not try to solve the question: How do we teach kids to be critical thinkers?"
5,Great for Beginning Teachers!,"I was given this book as a gift from my mom and found it a great read! I started reading it and could not put it down. Ok, you can laugh, however when I faced some of the same problems in my class I wanted to see how Mr. Clark would handle those situations (being he was Disney's Teacher of the Year, and was on Oprah). Mr. Clark gives excellent advice and tips on how to manage your class and set up routines from the get go. Being a beginning teacher it was refreshing to have someone say, this is what happened and this is how I fixed it. It is funny and useful and I can't wait to try some of his essentials in my room!"
4,Educational Uplift,"This book was a great read. It was an easy read, filled with short vignettes and suggestions on each page. It will be enjoyed by substitute teachers, classroom teachers and just about anyone in education. Positive books like this are always a welcome edition to my booshelf!--Shawn Schmittgen"
5,Inspirational!!,"This book inspires positivity and I would recommend. I purchased as a gift but had to have one for myself too!! I also strongly recommend the movie with Mathew Perry that tells the remarkable story of Ron Clark (the author and inspiration). I have been fortunate enough to hear him in person and I try everyday to remember the tools provided in this book. It can be useful in dealing with children, family and co-workers - respect is key!!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I was given this book from a friend in New York who said all the teachers in New York thought it was so wonderful. All I can say is that they must not have manners in New York. This man is making money by writing a book of manners. A teacher with common sense already teaches manners. I teach in the inner city and children can't remember 5 rules let alone 55. I teach manners every day, every hour. Ron Clark is a joke. Do not waste your money."
2,A Little Outrageous,"It seems to me that Mr. Clark is a bit of an egomaniac. While some of his ideas are wonderful, there are several that are completely ludicrous and unnecessary in a classroom or in any environment. In this book, he presents himself as someone who has to have his way no matter what. His no Doritos rule?!? What is that all about? Just because he had a bad experience once upon a time doesn't mean he has the right to ruin it for everyone else. His line rules are also somewhat excessive - the no talking what so ever not just in lines, but everywhere else. That may be fine for younger children, but as children get older, they are not going to follow this either because they don't want to or because they know it's going to bug the teacher.When I picked the book up, I liked the idea of the book from the back. As I got into it, however, I decided that Mr. Clark has too much time on his hands if he thinks that everyone should follow his rules than he is outrageous."
4,"Some Good Advice, Some Interesting Advice, Some Weird Advice","The Essential 55 is an interesting book that I think both parents and teachers can get a lot out of. Ron Clark, who is apparently a highly successful teacher, has set out 55 rules of his classroom he believes are the key to his and his student's success. Some of the advice is useful, if obvious (look your teacher in the eye, address teachers with ""sir"" and ""maam"". Some of the advice is weird--like always tipping in hotels and the length of time a group of students should applaud when congratulating a fellow student. The essence of this slim book could easily be distilled into a useful Parent's Magazine article--I'm not sure it warrants an entire book."
3,ok,This was ok. There were a few things I would use. A few of his ideas were a little over the top and I would have a hard time including into my day.
4,Ron Clark is amazing!,"I had the wrong idea when I started this book: It had been heralded as one of those ""life lessons"" books that people of all ages can learn from. And in that context, the book's rigid rule set is far too simpleton for the complex world in which we live.However, once I started reading the book in its proper context, that is, as a guide on how to educate children, I found it much more enjoyable. And my admiration for Ron Clark increased with each passing page. This guy is incredible! If only my grade school teachers had been as energetic and as innovative as he is.And, frankly, his results speak for themselves: His students love him, their test scores are high, and they do their homework -- and all of this in some of the most challenging school conditions in the country.A must read if you have young children, and an interesting read if you don't have children but are interested in how one man overcame the trials and tribulations of early childhood education."
4,Great Information!,I like how the book is full of information for teachers. It is organized in such a way that it is easy to go back and find something you are looking for. This book was recommended by my professor at the University of Texas at Tyler.
4,My life Line in the classroom,"This was such a great book. I couldn't have made it through my first year in the classroom with out this book. 8 years later I still employ the concepts that Clark emphasize in his text.Its perfect for the new teacher who is struggling, or a veteran teacher who is looking for some new ideas or a bit of professional development. This isn't for all teachers, but there is something for every level of teaching"
2,Letdown,This book was really hyped up and I was greatly let down. The tone of Clark's voice rings false and superficial. The book was short with little substance. On the plus side it was an easy read and occasionally entertaining.
2,Best Seller?,"I bought and read Ron Clark's book because I am an educator. I was interested because he won a great teacher award. I thought the parts that mentioned the White House visit and the Disney visit were wonderful, however, the rules Mr. Clark used, I found ridiculous. We must realize that Mr. Clark is still a fairly new teacher in the educational system. He has a lot to learn regarding the discipline of children. I was not impressed with the 55 Rules. I am surprised it was on the best seller list. As a teacher for the past eleven years, I have to say, Go with what works for you... Mr. Clark did!"
5,Great Book For Teachers,I had heard about this book several times from teachers and decided I needed to own it as well. It is such a great book with rules that makes sense. Every teacher should own this book.
3,Ok book movie was better!,Ok got a little boring around rule 35. The concepts are great but not realistic if you have a family of your own.
3,Well Duuuuhhhhhh!,"No wonder Oprah likes this guy. Just like Dr. Phil, he is the master of stating the obvious.My mom got me this book to give me a few teaching ideas as I start my first year of teaching. The thing is, almost all the 55 rules (with the exception of a few interesting ones) are things that any teacher worth his paperweight should be applying to the classroom: Say please, thank you, and excuse me. Don't interrupt. Well, duh.Perhaps the point of the book is not the rules themselves, but the concepts that they all rotate around: respect and courteousy, which are concepts admittedly absent from most SUV driving cell phone using adults nowadays, let alone kids. If that's what Mr. Clark is trying to pound home, perhaps another format would have made that point better. Then again, perhaps not.I got a thing or two from this book, but not nearly as much as it's lauded to provide. Perhaps all the best teachers are just too intuitively good at what they do to provide much advice."
4,Liked as a follow up to his story done on film,I have not yet read in detail. I may pass this along to a teacher for use here in a rual area
1,Good for people who never took an education class,"This is a great book for someone who has never taught in a classroom or taken any introductory education classes. All of the information in this book is taught in any entry level college education class. Since Mr. Clark was not an education major in college, the things he learned on the fly while teaching astounded him. To an education major, they are givens. By the way, Mr. Clarke quit teaching within 2 years of receiving the Disney Teacher of the Year award to go on the book promo circuit and make more money than a dedicated teacher does. This book is a waste of money."
1,Excellent!,"This book is excellent....If only we had more teachers like this now, our nation, and our world would be a better place!"
4,Head-sticky,"Sarah has a really distinctive voice and the songs just stick in my head (which is a good thing, a proof-of-worth thing), especially Like Louise Brooks. Its not like it took a long time to get into them, they were charming right away, but they got better after I had more time to mull over them, for them to pop up in my head while I was doing the grocery shopping. It's perfect music for spring. For rainy days too."
3,Gets the Job Done,A basic atlas that focuses on politics. A lot more should have been included- espically better maps.
5,Works transparently and reliably,"I needed a way to hook an old PDA to a PC with no serial ports running Windows XP. The drivers loaded perfectly, the software recognized the cable as a COM port, and it's been working just fine ever since. Definitely a niche product, but a useful one!"
3,Needs full size CD,"This needs a full size CD, will not work in slot CD drives, tried downloading drivers off web no luck, using bootcamp and XP on Mac.UPDATE I did get this working using the new Prolific R-V 1210 driver>>>>works good now."
5,beautifula nd informative book,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful book about the volatile genius Caravaggio. The text gives an interesting and compelling account of the artist's turbulent life, and the book would not be nearly so good without it, yet it is the beautiful color prints that take the breath away. All depictions are in color, and are often augmented with detailed close-ups or the works of other artists who influenced, or were influenced by, Caravaggio.A wonderful book for anyone interested in this remarkable artist."
1,plunger plague,"bored stone tiles and installed to later fill and find that plunger does not function and there seem to be no replacement plungers. Just days later they now no longer even show bronze plungers but show chrome/satin on bronze holder? I am very dissappointed that there is no recourse for this situation.Jerry Mahlberg, General Contractor"
3,Nice new baby keepsake; not a useful rattle,"We got this as a present and it is a very pretty little keepsake. It goes well with other silver keepsakes we have, like a little silver covered photo album and silver piggy bank. However, this rattle has not really captured out 5.5 month old baby's interest, although other rattling toys have. Further, the few times she has played with it we were alarmed by its damage potential. When she waves it around (flails) there is a good chance she will knock herself in the head with it. This can happen with any rattle, but most are not made of hard silver. Second, when she is flailing it around, there is a good chance she will fling it, and it can accidentally hit a plate, glass or other breakable. Again this can happen with any rattle, but most are not heavy silver. Finally, other rattles are also good teethers. I don't want her teething on a silver rattle. So we have retired it to the top of her bureau where it is very attractive among the other keepsakes."
4,"Solid, informative read","Setting the record straight isn't intended to tittilate, or even amuse the reader. (At least I hope not) It is a collection of hard, believable facts that lay out the whens and whys of events in Hendrix's abbreviated stint as a rock n roll God and enduring legend in a loose chronological fashion. (Whew!)There are other books out there with wild stories from dubious sources that may be more entertaining. But if you're looking to find out precisely what Jimi and his handlers did to create the legend. And to get 1st hand opinions from those who worked closest with him and to his mindset in noteable situations, Then this is a must read. There's a lot of ""what not to do"" to be gleened from it as well."
1,Who cares!,"If you are interested in Jimi's business managers, read this book. If you are interested in a biography of Jimi, don't. After about 100 pages of babble referring to travel, paperwork, and who knew who, I ripped this book in half and threw it in the trash can (not recycling bin). I was expecting to learn something about Jimi, not his bosses, and I held on as long as I could. I kept hoping, after 15, 20, 25, 45, etc. pages, that the authors would get to something of substance in regard to Hendrix's psyche, life, ambitions, shirt size, something, but it never happened. It just kept going with record/business ""data"", so I lost faith. Who knows, maybe if I would have read up to page 250, the interesting stuff would have started."
5,Unbiased Biography of Jimi Hendrix,"An interesting and well written account of James Allen Hendrix's transformation into ""Jimi"" and the tremendous influence Chas Chandler had on his development into a major star."
2,Bronze Finis Metal Cord Cover,"This was a bugger for me (a single woman) to put up!! requires drilling holes putting in plastic holders for screws, then screwing the back metal part to the wall. It was not just as easy as snapping the cover that hides the cord either. I need to go the hardware store and get one of those plastic covers that just stick to the wall. Of course it doesn't help that I put it up a little on a slant and cannot stand to look at it. I will have to take it down and fill holes then paint before I can put the new one up!! I wouldn't recommend this product unless you have a handyman handy!"
2,this was recommended but I did not need it,"I purchased a wall lamp and it was recommended that I buy this but one was included with the lamp and this purchase was completely unnecessary. I have not bothered to return it, therefore have wasted $13.00. You should not be recommending that this be purchased with the lamps."
4,Amazing Adventure,Zack meets an Egyptian ant in Central Park on a school trip. The Egyptian ant doesn't mean an ant from Egypt but an ant who has a culture like old Egypt. And the ant Zack meets is a slave ant who escaped from a colony. Zack decide helping her. What adventures are waiting him?I think this is a good adventure story. Author sets very special situations and makes the story interesting.Many things happen in short time. And many ideas in the story that let you surprise.Especially I felt familiar with the Egypt stuff in this story because I visited Egypt this May.Enjoy the adventures with Zack!
4,The Death of the Jacobite Cause,"Stuart Reid's many books are among the best modern sources for the final Jacobite Risings, and the '45 and the Battle of Culloden. The coverage of the forces present, their positioning on the battlefield, and their movements during the battle is beyond thorough, and Gerry Embleton's three color plates add a splash of lively color. Overall this is what a good Osprey title looks like, offering concise but detailed information on the topic and reinforcing it with lots of contemporary artwork, bird's eye views of the battlefield, and other visual sources."
4,Frosty the snowman...,"Being an appreciator (new word, I just invented it) of Brit comedy and drama and especially their costume dramas, Inspector Frost is the clapper that strikes my bell. Just as good as Morse and Lewis I think, but more gritty, as he usually deals with the more common folk than they do. Jason's Darling Buds of May hits it out of the park. As I think he also does as Frost. He hates the bureaucratic paper shuffling aspects of his job and avoids it whenever he can and in the process is more successful than his comrades. Good show and strongly recommended."
5,A Real Life British Detective Series,"Frost is an unpolished Morse,with (alas) an even skimpier sociallife.The stories are excellent-suspenseful,involving real lifepeople.The crime is serious,but not quite so ""grimy"" as inthe excellent Prime Suspect series.In each case,Frost has anew partner,who is an integral part of the story.He is heroic(winning the George Cross), has empathy for many of thevictims,and is lucky. The acting,photography,and introductorymusic are excellent.Each of the 4 stories is 100 minutes inlength.I will be buying the next series due in July.Enjoythis one."
3,Beautiful but lacking Practical Substance,"I was seduced by the lovely photographs, fun peel-and-stick arrangements, and cute mix-and-match cut outs. But when I really tried to use the book to plan a practical workspace that will serve family and guests for years, I found advice and guidelines skimpy and vague. I wanted more solid information, including specific attributes of a good work triangle, and important space allowances for walkways, cabinets and counters. I also wanted more attention given to relative costs of materials.Yet, it was very enjoyable to poor over the ideas, styles and photographs."
2,Silly waste of trees and ink,"The advertised mix'n'match flip page parts are just different colors of the same items! This is a very superficial book, good to pair with the new gender free EasyBake Oven for beginning beginners.Okay, so I'm being rough, but really, the author & publisher should have given more for such a pretentious package"
4,A Great Debut Solo Album,"I bought this cd after purchasing the second one first. This is a great debut cd by Hartmann with a rocking opening track and great variety in the other songs. His singing is unique, kind of a Jorn meets Lou Graham type ability. A great cd which I believe is bette than the second one, but I do look forwar to obtaining more of his prior efforts from At Vance, Avantasia and so on. Keep em coming!!!"
1,A Practical Guide to CRM,Redundant reference to nearly every main point. This book could easily have been one third the length and twice as effective if the author had been concise.
3,"Peace, Love, vibraphones and Jalapeno Peppers","Buy this! Mandrill's first record is one of the truly unique opuses of the late '60s hippie scene. They have a sound of their own but if you like early Santana, War, Sly, and the more high-energy late '60s-to-early-'70s hippie music in general, there's very little chance of not enjoying this. And how many rock bands have a horn section and a vibraphone player anyway outside the Zappa Universe? Excellent guitar player named Omar and a great singing voice on whoever the singer is in the band too (one of the Wilson Brothers?) two notches above Greg Rollie for sure. ""Mandrill"" would rate 4 stars but I automatically take one star off any record that mentions the words ""Peace"" and ""Love"" more than ten times in 2 minutes."
5,I should have been alive to see the 60s...,"if i had to name one band as my favorite, i couldn't do it. 60s music is so amazing to me, and this book about John Lennon has totally supported that opinion of mine. i am 18 but usually listen to ""oldies."" this book is incredible. it has the most random but so significant memorabilia in it, including a replicated Ed Sullivan Show ticket. it is so great, i bought it today, and i am enthralled with it. If you have any appreciation for 60s music at all, you will adore this book, i promise"
5,IN JOHN'S LIFE,"This is an outstanding biography of John Lennon.This is a high caliber, comprehensive work that follows John Lennon's early years in Liverpool and the formation of the rock bands he founded until its final evolution as the Beatles. There are a plethora of good photographs and material that will captivate readers from Beatle experts to lay persons. This author has clearly done an excellent job of researching his material.Yoko's input is invaluable and helps to make a good work all the more effective. Imagine owning this masterpiece - you will be so glad that you do. As for the Beatles, in my life, I love them more. This book will certainly spark an even keener interest in the Beatles and the man known as the Chief Beatle, John Lennon."
5,LENNON LEGEND Gotta Have It !,"This book is fantastik ! I love all great extra,treats.Copies of handwritten songs.Mini posters,photos,and so much more.A must have for any,LENNONLOVER !Enjoy ! Cheers,R.P.M."
3,"book great, condition not so great","I'm giving this book as a gift and from flipping through it I can tell it will be a winner. My only complaint is the condition it is in ... I selected a ""new"" book but got one that was dented, with scratch marks and a black marker that has crossed out the tag on the back. Not the best look for a gift ..."
3,Not particularly poor,"The cookbook itself if somewhere between a 4 and a five, with moderately good advice, but the author's overwhelming arrogance lowers the rating. For examples of this arrogance within the page, just read his description. It's difficult to imagine it being written without an incredibly smug look on his face."
2,Not that great,"The A/C series was better than the other test prep guides but not by much.I'm going to write the same review for all three of the ASE Test Prep guides I purchased.To be honest, I'm not very impressed. I'm used to the study guides for the FAA flight tests which are generally excellent from everyone. These had typos in the questions. One question even said to refer to a diagram which they forgot to print! I also found several mistakes in their subject matter in the study section.I think they are an aid and do help with the preparation but they publisher could have done a much better job especially for the price."
3,Interesting Start,"I have recently finished this novel and decided to write my review about it. Overall I found it to be an intersting yarn. The pace was fast paced and never ending. That I found, strangely enough, tedious. Usually in the majority of the novels there is more than your fair share of conflicts but there was also 'down' time if you will between the battles. And some of the situations seemed highly unlikely as well. But this is the Deathlands we are talking about so it is to be expected. The major complaint I have however is the fact that Overton was never really explained. I mean, where did he come from? How did he get the weaponry and the APC's? The other complaint I have is that the writer totally disregarded the fact that Nathan Cawdor is a Doomie, which was outlined in Homeward Bound.Still, overall, it wasn't bad. It was kind of fun."
2,Wait for the paperback edition,"I'm a huge Brust fan, but this book disappoints. There really is no plot to speak of, and the stories (and characters) meander about. As for the narrator, Paarfi is boring at first, but as the plot fails to move along, his voice becomes more and more annoying. There are some interesting bits info about Morrolan and Sethra, but these small gems are not worth the price of a hardback."
2,Succeeds at mimicing a scholarly dissertation,"This purports to be a scholarly dissertation about an imaginary world. Unfortunately, it succeeds. There is a reason that dissertations are not published in mass media. They are boring and overly wordy. I love Steven Brust books and the fact he will try new things, but this just couldn't hold my interest. It is still better than a lot of books out there, but it isn't great and that is what I have come to expect from Brust."
4,Dumas in Faerie,"Lord of Castle Black is the latest of Brust's Khaavren stories, specifically the second part of Viscount of Adrilankha. Brust does an amazing job of capturing the tone and feel of Alexandre Dumas' Three Musketeers stories, without the boring bits. Brust's writing is clearly improving from book to book. A very fun read, ending in what is becoming the typical Brust cliff hanger. If he follows the Dumas canon, there should be at least one more in the series."
5,First Class Delivery,"Signed, Sealed & Delivered is a great album from Stevie Wonder. The title track is among his most popular with its ringing guitars, blazing horns, southern fried sound and fiery vocals it is a r&b classic. Many of the songs point towards his movement into more social and political commentary. His cover of the Beatles' ""We Can Work It Out"" turns it from a song about a love relationship into a song about racial unity. ""Never Had A Dream Come True"" is another song about inequality. The album's most moving and emotional song is ""Heaven Help Us"". The song has a powerful orchestral movement and is a plea for change. The album showed a more mature artist and is a forerunner of the work he would explore later in the decade."
4,His best before his complete freedom,"How'd this on get overlooked? I see all the obvious Stevie masterpeices getting raves, but what about this one. Signed, sealed... is the final link from boy to man in Stevie's evolution. It's still ""Motown Sound"" based but you can tell that Stevie is trying to break the mold. Contains joyous soul shouters like the title track, ""Sugar"" (my favorite) and ""I Gotta Have A Song"". Brilliant!!!"
3,Stardust maybe not for kids,"I don't understand this pair up. The first two look like they are for preteens. Stardust would be for teens and up, as there are some scary bloody stuff, even though the movie is in the Fantasy genre. Stardust is a great movie."
5,Cold is the best band out right now...,"'A Different Kind of Pain' is definitely a different kind of Cold album, but you can't say that it isn't the same Cold because atleast 5 of these songs were previously unreleased soon after 'Year of the Spider' came out. I saw Cold in concert and it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to (and I've been to a lot!) There isn't one song on the ablum that is insignificant. I'm a huge Cold fan and even on their previous albums there is atleast one song I'd skip (Kill the Music Industry or Stupid Girl for example). Not on this album... if you want to sample it first listen to When Angels Fly Away, Tell Me Why, or Anatomy of a Tidal Wave (my opinion the best 3). COLD ARMY!!!!"
1,A different kind of boredom,"Bad Cd, too slow, too boring. Get over it allready. Get out in the sun a little. These guys are depressing and boring. Year of the spider was great, this is just dull."
3,Better luck next time,"I was looking forward to the release of this album as much as I was anything else that has come out in the past year. Year of the spider is one of those albums that has meant the world to me, it came along at the right time in my life and it jsut fit every emotion that i was trying to express but couldn't get out or my head. So needless to say that from an album called a different kind of pain, i was hoping for more of the same therapy. All and all i guess i was let down. Since cold played the old switcharoo guitarist game on this album it really seems like a lot is missing. most of the edge is gone on this one leaving a flat music pallet. The words are deep and meaningful but the music is missing the umph that it had before and unfortunaly what is left is nothing more then an average release. and you have no idea how hard it is for me to say that.thank you for your time"
3,Hmmm...,"I love the old cold, year of the spider is my favorite. This one, im not sure how to take it yet."
5,Incredible,"I've been a fan of Cold since ""13 Ways to Bleed on Stage""; In my opinion, 'Stupid Girl' from ""Year of the Spider"" was too radio friendly, but still a great song. I picked up ""A Different Kind of Pain"" after a new friend let me hear the album. I must say, that I am very impressed with the finished product. Scooter did a great job on writing the lyrics for this album, especially on 'Tell Me Why'. These guys know what music is and how to write it. It came from thier heart."
2,Too much sugar,"Too much sugar, not enough spice. Cold was a great band for combining the edgier apects of hard rock with melody for a balanced sound. Now they have gone completley melodic and destroyed the balance that made them good. For those that want all sweet melody,this will be a good album and from the reviews it seems that a lot of people like it. However, if you are a rock listener that likes a little salt in the mix listen well to the samples and make sure of what you are getting."
2,Bland and Boring,"The loss of both original guitarist shines through everywhere on this album. If you enjoyed anything previously done by Cold, you will probably not like this album. The melodies are generic, and the beats are dull. The only saving grace is Scooter's lyrics, but that unfortunately cannot pull this album out of the gutter.I would write more, but I don't want put more time into my review than the band spent making this album. Save your 15 bucks."
2,A different kind of Cold...,"...and not a particularly great one, either. I loved Cold's first two albums (especially ""13 Ways to Bleed Onstage""), ""Year of the Spider"" was a bit dodgy but still not bad, this album is just greatly disappointing. They used to have a cool, distinctive way of playing the whole numetal/post-grunge/post-polka/whatever the hell label you want to put on this genre, but this album is just as bland and banal as Seether, Shinedown, or any of those bands. Scooter even sounds like he's trying to sound like the singers in those bands. Sorry, but this ain't for me.But, uh, the cover art is pretty cool."
3,There is something positive to come away with from all of Cold's albums,"I own all Cold's CD's with my personal favorite being ""13 Ways to Bleed"". While ""A Different Kind of Pain"" is not my favorite it's not because it's bad but just because it's different. There is something positive to come away with from all of Cold's albums.To whoever took that cheap shot and referred to Scooter's ""squirrel nuts"" how the hell would you know anything about squirrel nuts? Either you have squirrel nuts yourself or you'd like to see for yourself if Scooter has squirrel nuts. Either way you should be horsewhipped for that disingenous personal attack on Scooter."
2,sheer dissa-cold-ment,"Of course I bought the new album, as I love Cold and feel I would support them even if they suddenly did a rap album, but I was really dissapointed with this poor attempt at being different than other hard rock acts. Cold does not show ANY signs of being different on this album.So whenever I have the urge to put this album on, I put on their debut album instead. I think you all should too. If we all do it, hopefully Scooter will realise they had something at the first attempt."
1,cold goes emo,"I dont know what cold was trying to prove with the release of ADKOP, but it sucks. I hated YOTS, too catchy and melodic, but i thought that it was maybe just a phase. this record moves even further from the cold sound. Heavy rock is dying, and as a true blue hardrocker, it pains me to say that. It seems like everyone is jumping on the girlpants wearin popemoscreamopunk bandwagon, and cold is just another jumper. if you support hard, heavy rock, dont buy this record."
5,Excellent Comeback,"This is a very good album. Cold were having some issues a while back, the singer in rehab and the guitarist leaving the band for Evanescence. In my experience very few bands make albums as good as the last one. Although not quite as good as ""Year of the Spider"", it is still a very good album especially considering the things they've been through. My personal favorite track - ""Ocean"""
5,Cold Remains Stellar,"After the year of the spider i was unsure which direction Cold would go for the new album. A different Kind of Pain is exactly the direction I was hoping Cold would go for. Cold keeps the rock and nu-metal feel, but pleases me with the melodic and heart felt moments in several songs. I believe this album has proven that Cold is a band which knows their potential and has reached it."
3,New Cold Album,"I am a huge cold fan and have been for a while.Compared to Cold's first three albums a differant kind of painis a step back. The first three albums cold put out were all a little differant and unique from one another and each one had a certain appeal or dark edge. Songs like Give, Go away, Goodbye cruel world, Confession, same drug, suffocate, wasted years, ect, had that appeal and continue to amaze me after all these years. This album just seems to be missing the dark edge that all the other albums had. Its like it is missing somthing. With that being said it is still Cold and they are still one of my favorite bands of all time. The album idoes have its bright moments and I will still play it to death. Just dont expect to much from it. I hope for cold's next album they will be a little more like the Cold on the first two albums."
5,Great Cd From The Group Cold,"this is my 1st experience with the group cold i went and listened to the sound samples on amazon and really liked the songs and i went and bought the cd and the song samples don't do the cd justice ! every song on here was great but the best song on the album i think is the title track A Different Kind Of Pain , altho all the songs was great this is my favorite , i have never heard of cold before this won't be my last cd i buy of this group !! way to guys !! excellent cd !!!"
4,"Not quite ""Back Home""","Well I must say I was looking forward to this Album for around the last six months and I must say I wasn't disapointed. I will say however that there was something missing however, and I believe that was the less hard hitting guitars which (besides Scooter Ward's awesome vocals) gave them their awesome sound. The New guys fill in well, but it just seems as though the music were lacking a bit, although it wasn't awful, and Scooter as always does a great (and probably his best) vocal performance ever on this CD. Overall I'd probably give the CD around a 4.5/5 but that wasn't an option. In comparison to other Albums I believe they did a good job competing with Stainds ""Chapter V"" but overall I feel Staind has a few more memorable songs on it than Cold does in this one....Again though A Great Heart-felt album worthy of praise!"
2,boring,"guitars are boring and simple ,the vocals were ok but most of the songs were bad.There is only about 4 good songs on this cd"
1,PURE CRAP!,"This is the most sorry Cold album to date. If you want to hear them in their prime buy the self-titled album, or ""13 ways"" even the cheesy ""Year Of The Spider"" (the start of the decline) OWNS this! Scooter's (lead singer's) newest project ""The Witch"" is even worse. Rock is supposed to have guitars, and I don't even hear a bass in this entire album, the drumming is very faint at best, the vocals get annoying and whiney. PLEASE COLD GO BACK TO YOUR OLD SOUND!!!! Save your money buy something REAL."
5,awesome album,"I have been a fan of cold ever since year of the spider came out. Then i got 13 ways and the self title album , then i saw them in concert on there yots tour, and they have become my favorite bad ever. This new album, A different kind of pain , is in my opinion , there best album. It might be slower than the others, but it has the lyrical genuis of scooter to make it run. I love ever song on this album(just like the other albums) but for me this album's lyrics touch me more and i can relate to them in every way. great album and if you are a cold fan, pick it up."
3,The same kind of pain,"this isn't a bad album, it's actually fairly good if you're not familar with cold's previous albums. one might wonder though, why a talented band like cold keeps recycling its earlier material. why do they write the same lyrics and melodies over and over again?get cold's ""year of the spider"" instead."
3,For anyone else this would be good but...,"for Cold it is not. One thing about Cold is that they've always been very atmospheric and dark. I remember way back years ago, when their self-titled came out and was blown away by just how f@#%$#% dark it was. And, while a lot of that comes from Scooter's vocals, a good portion of that was the distorted and crunchy guitars which for the most part on this album are completely gone. Because of this, in my humble opinion this is no longer a metal album but it is a rock album. The songwriting is good and Scooter's vocals are good (although not as extreme) but simply, the heaviness is gone. And without the heaviness, Cold just seem like a decent rock band without an edge."
4,Bragg is good for you,You know it is Bragg when it tastes good and is good for you. This is a tasty seasoning with the right mix of ingredients to make eating more enjoyable. Sprinkle it on just about anytbing and enjoy. A really healthy mix with no regrets after the fun.
4,Easy to swallow,My doc recommend that I start taking L-Carnitine so that my body would burn fat instead of muscle. These are flavorless and easy to swallow and are one of several of Source Naturals products that I've had positive experiences with.
5,Great Product,Received product by the date promised. Product is highly recommended for folks on the Atkins Diet to convert fat into energy. It is also supposed to have some limited beneficial effects for diabetics and those with high cholesterol. Have used for approx. 9 months and find it effective in giving me more energy.
3,molding edges,Bull Horn Wine cork pull looks nice and fit the period of the show. We had to sand and dremel down the molding edges. They were actually sharp enough to cut one's hand on. But once we took care of that issue all went well.
5,the dynamic duo,"cody lundin and dave canterbury show after a horrific storm how to collect items of use purify water and live in a world turned upside down, this is a great video all should own and watch time and again because the unexpected can happen to us all"
5,Love Actually (widescreen),I loved the movie the first time I saw it but never had the chance to buy it becuase everywhere I went it was in fullscreen and I despise fullscreen. Anyway I found it on Amamzon adn I jumped at the opportunity to purchase it.
5,Great Movie Out with the Girls,"I really enjoyed this movie along with my 20 and 30-something single girlfriends. It was witty, romantic, funny, feel-good, and overall enjoyable.I'm just an average person who enjoyed the movie worth the ticket price:)"
5,A Favorite Movie on Love and Christmas,"My wife and I laughed, and were brought to tears throughout this movie. It is an interwoven number of stories about Love and relationships - and the hardships and highlights within familes.The acting is great - and we have watched this move many times over the last couple of years."
4,"Not a realistic film , but designed to give that impression","This is a film that seems to be a comedy , but not everything always works out in life . A lot of different stories are presented to the viewer , but none outstay their welcome .The great comic writer Richard Curtis is behind this film and it's about time they let him go behind the camera , as the amount of money his scripts have made for other actors would be quite scary .This is a romantic comedy with a little bit more depth to it .You are likely to know already if you like this film as you will go by the actors in it .It's a nice little diversion with some well placed music ."
5,Love Actually,"No long review, I love this movie, have it on dvd.... Happy , sad, and LOVE. you wont be disappointed"
3,No Plot,"There were endearing moments, but the lack of storyline made it hard to stick with it. We spent most of the movie trying to figure out where the story was going before we finally realized that it wasn't going anywhere."
2,Not my idea of a romantic comedy,"This film seemed to have been written by two different writers. The stories of Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson and Keira Knightley were very touching and poignant. The stud wannabe going to Wisconsin to meet girls was funny but exaggerated, Hugh Grant's story was totally unrealistic, Colin Firth didn't look remotely in love and Sarah's story seemed to have been written to evince sadness. As for the nude stand-ins..I imagine a 16 year old writer or director wanting that in a film..no other reason for it."
5,Great Movie!,"I didn't know if I would like this movie, so I rented it first. And I was very surprised at how cute and heart-warming the movie was. It is very funny in many parts. The movie follows several story lines and then comes all together at the end. After renting this movie, I asked for it for Christmas. This is a great movie about love and relationships. I highly recommend this movie to people who like romantic comedies!"
5,A favorite...,"A favorite that I can and do watch over and over again. And, one of the few movies I'd buy on DVD."
1,Ridiculous,"This movie insulted the intelligence of everyone in attendance. The theme of it was the less you know someone, the more likely you are to fall madly in love with them. Hugh Grant's character, the prime minister of England, fell in love with a woman upon simply seeing her. That is Hollywood crap. The child that plays Liam Neeson's son is the most articulate character in the movie, and speaks clearly about his love for another 10 year old, which, if you've ever been in the presence of a 10 year old, is a bit less than realistic. I thought this movie was a spoof on romantic comedies, as I couldn't believe that even Hollywood would come up with such a far fetched tale. Don't waste your money."
2,nauseating,"This movie is so tacky. It was easy to predict what would happen next and as it did, I cringed in my seat. Running to the airport to say ""I Love You"", how cliche and cheezy. I begged that it wouldn't happen but all of the extremely ridiculuous and unimaginative love scenarios broke through. Credit to Emma Thompson for her excellent role, but other than that, I was so glad when it was finally over, and then I apologized to my friend for dragging her to see such a waste of film. How ridiculuous was Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister! All he has in common with Tony Blair is that he's British."
1,Puh-leeease,"Insipid, unromantic, implausable are the mildest terms to describe this utterly uninspired piece of dreck. Leaving matters of the heart, emotional honesty and intimacy to the British is tantamount to relying on the Germans to pump out comedies. The movie is painful to watch. They have dragged every name UK actor out of a deep coma to sleepwalk through their roles. If this is the best Britain has to offer then please, don't bother. The inane political subplot is so insulting and simplistic it is a wonder that adults wrote this garbage."
3,Crass remarks about WTC disturbing,"""Love is everywhere. When the planes hit the twin towers, I'm sure none of the phone calls made were about hate."" -""Love Actually"" from Universal PicturesThis is how the producers of ""Love Actually"" attempt to validate their movie. I was appalled when in the opening moments of the movie; Hugh Grant's character crassly utters this line. Why would anyone assume that it would be okay to use the WTC tragedy in this manner? I sat there, stunned in the dark, pulled back to reality. My husband said, ""I wish he hadn't said that."" I agree, I think this line needs to be pulled from this movie.It is up to you if you want to see this movie; the rest of it was a jump around, too many story lines, amusing fare. I just want to forewarn as many people as possible because I was completely shocked. No one should find themselves sitting in the darkened theater; a victim of Universal Pictures' bad judgment"
2,English Bable,My daughter and daughter in law liked it. My wife watched it I lasted 10 minutes and went to the internet.
1,Great cast - poor in the area of nudity and language,"The language was horrible and the nudity was unacceptable. These two components totally distracted from the dialogue and connections that could've been made with the characters. I'm ordering an ""edited version"" from another company so I can actually enjoy the acting and solid story line."
5,GREAT,I LOVE THIS MOVIE I HAD IT ON VHS AND GOT IT ON DVD TO TAKE TRAVLING WITH ME . I SEEN IT 1000 TIME AND STILL LOVE.
2,"Love is not in my air, actually.","I thought this was going to be a lot better. I'm glad that I just rented it because that's all it is good for is a watch. The only part that meant anything to me was the ending. The rest of the movie was quite bland. I do have to say there was nice casting here, but it's such a shame that they were wasted on this movie. As for the DVD extras, there was a lot of boring stuff. I went to the menu, then quickly got out of it. If you decide to watch this, rent it because I think 20.00 is steep for a movie like this."
2,Tried to hard,"The movie has all the things that you would want to see at X'mas, however I felt that the plot was all over the place and that they tried to hard.. Wouldnt recommend it unless it was a rainy day!"
2,A few comments about the DVD version,"I liked the movie enough to buy it, so there's no need for me to comment on the film itself. The DVD is what annoys me. I hate that there are previews on the disc, and I really hate that I can't go straight to the menu, I have to fast forward through these previews. That is my biggest complaint.The other thing that I really don't like is the menu graphic -- just a heart. What a terribly boring choice. A good movie, but an awful DVD."
2,Not for diabetics...,"This is one of the most cloying, sickeningly precious films I think I've ever seen. If you can get through the first ten minutes without cringeing, you might actually like ""Love, Actually."" If not, you're in for a sticky ride, full of so many wince-inducing ""awwwww"" moments that I thought I was watching the film adaptation of a line of a Hallmark cards. And for a film purporting to be about love, there isn't one single honest human emotion on display. And there hasn't been an all-star cast playing such witless wanks since Burt Reynolds and ""The Cannonball Run."" Bill Nighy alone is hysterically funny, hence the two stars. ""Love, Actually"" is ""Dreadful, Actually"" in every possible way."
2,good but...,"good movie, would have gotten 5 stars if they cut the porno scenes out in order to go for a rating of PG13. those scenes were very awkward and out of place... the rest of the movie and the stories and interconnections were great!"
2,"How can ""new"" be damaged inside the package?","I ordered this ""new"" DVD for the holidays, along with four others. This particular DVD was rattling when it arrived -- obviously something inside was broken. The DVD packaging/holder was damaged inside (the actual DVD was intact), leading me to wonder how can something that is ""new"" be damaged before it is even opened? The UPS shipping package was not damaged nor were the other four DVDs -- clearly this is a problem with the particular seller."
3,Some great scenes but a bit too obscene,"There were some really hilarious scenes in this ""romantic"" comedy that definitely made it worthwhile to see, along with some great music! However, the stories were a bit too unconnected and the push at the end to make them connect was too far a stretch. The overt sexuality was overdone, considering the right audience for the story, or more correctly, stories, is not likely to be the type of audience to appreciate the soft porn. It interferes with the lightness of the movie, pulling the audience from their relaxed dreamy states to one of irritation, and it was all unnecessary.The cast and music were the biggest saving graces of this film. I am curious, though, as to why the profiles of the actors playing Sarah's love interest and Colin's buddy are not mentioned on the film's website."
1,"""hate actually, too much heartache""","it started out interesting until about the middle.There are way better romance movies out there like the 'Notebook"",""Somewhere in Time,"" ""Against all odds"",or ""What dreams may come."""
2,"So much potential, so much left on the table...","The cast, headed by Hugh Grant, was so promising that 5-10 minutes into the movie you figure the movie must have cost an arm and a leg to produce...Though funny at many points, the movie starts to get diluted very early in the game, with so many different plots, that you start ""missing"" characters until they come back much later into the movie. The biggest problem with this plethora of plots is that most of them are resolved quite poorly, or left unclear. Barely a couple of the stories kept me engaged all the way through, specially since so many of them had such a weird ending.As much expectation as we had for this chick flick, it turned out to be quite dissapointing. Save yourself the time and rent some other Hugh Grant movie. As for this one, definitely not his best or a good movie worth checking out."
1,Don't waste your time & money,"Recipe for ""Love Actually"": Pull out every hackneyed cliche in the book, mix in some sappy, syrupy-sweet stock ""chick flick"" situations, add a lot of bad writing in which the characters all attempt to sound cute and clever, and WALLA! You get one of the most insultingly bad romantic ""date"" movies ever made. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, and nothing in it could ever really happen... it's escapist fluff. Nothing wrong with escapism, but this goes too far. There were a couple of funny lines and some situations that were potentially interesting (yet fell flat), but overall it was a complete waste -- not only of my time and money but of the acting talent assembled in the cast. I give it five pieces of dung."
2,Disappointed Actually,"After watching the previews and listening to reviews from both professionals and trusted friends I was very excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, the result did not live up to my expectations. The main problem was that there were too many plot lines. They weren't too difficult to follow, however, and that was the problem. If separated into their respective stories each plot line couldn't have taken more than 10 or 15 minutes, and you can write a decent story in that amount of time, but not a good story, and certainly not a great one.Because of the title I was expecting the movie to leave me with the warm fuzzies, but most of them left me feeling dissatisfied. I'm a big Colin Firth fan and I was grateful that at least his story was good. That saved it from my rating the movie one star. All in all, I wish I had never seen the movie. I would have been much happier with my illusion of a good movie."
1,dreck,"Despite a few interesting moments, this movie is terrible. The Tony Blair character meets the assistant and falls in love scenario is so truly, epically bad, I cannot contemplate who wrote this. Forget this and just watch Four Wedding and a Funeral again - you'll be much happier."
2,"Crap, Actually","Although it is at times witty and delightfully British, it is really not a very good movie. So there is this great cast, these wonderful actors (Emma Thompson, Hugh Grqant, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman for christ's sake) employed in the most desolate, incomplete, asinine roles of their careers. There is little to no character development and few storylines reach any sort of comprehensible conclusion. Bad, so horribly bad."
4,best christmas film ever..,"this film is bang on..interweaving around 10 love stories..and choosing the most competent starcast ..this sure is love actually..Hugh grant as the loveable british priminster,Colin firth as the writer who runs away from his french love only to fall in love with the immidiate best ,a porteguese housekeeper,emma thompson who is trying to comprehend the fact that her husband(Alan rickman) might b cheating on her and then Liam neeson trying to deal with the death of his wife and takin care of his son..and many more of such love stories..get any idea..this movie doesnt has much of a mind..if thats something intrigues u ..but it sure has a lot of heart..watch it to fall in love with it..although i was kind of disappointed with Rowan Atikinson's part..he looks completely wasted..but what the heck..the rest of the movie makes up for it so well that by the time it gets over u all u can think of is..christmas is allaround us so cmon an let it snow.."
1,Terrifyingly corny,"I actually found this movie frightening.I am proud to say that I was forced to see this movie on a bad date, and that otherwise I would never have even pondered subjecting myself to it. For the first time in my life I felt lucky to be a smoker, as it allowed me to gasp for breath and leave the theater a few times.Why there were talented actors in this syrupy, ludicrous and stomach turning piece of bile is beyond my comprehension. I can only rationalize it this way: Hugh Grant needed money for another prostitute, Billy Bob Thornton was on something, and Liam Neeson thought it was a parody of a romance film.Did The Blair Witch Project scare you? Wait till you see this one."
1,all you need is love,there's a good version of A Y N I L but otherwise I found the movie to be pretty boring and slow. Just fast forwarded through it. Not recommended.
1,Disappointed in quality of DVD,"What I saw of the movie, I liked - however, the DVD had a flaw in it, so wasn't able to watch the whole movie."
2,Average Brit RomCom,"This movie does exactly what it says on the tin. It's sugary, uncomplicated fluf, but never pretends to be anything else. As for the reviewer complaining about what he calls 'U.S' bashing - first of all this is a British movie reflecting a non U.S opinion, which makes a change from the patronising pro-US/Land of the free/God bless America tripe that Hollywood seems determined to force down everyone's throats at every turn.At the end of the day, this is an average Christmas feel good movie."
1,"Trash, actually","I loved Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill. Nonsense, but well acted and directed. And fun. The Black Adder series can be watched over and over again for pleasure without ever going stale. All written by Richard Curtis. I didn't expect intellectually stimulating social comment - just to be entertained. But this was awful. I wanted to turn it off after 10 minutes and only watched because I couldn't believe how bad it was. I'm amazed at the positive reviews here. Have we become this stupid? What hope have we of getting decent films made when the public go overboard for this trash. It should have been good. It was a good idea. But EVERYTHING about it was bad. We should be asking for our money back, demanding a remake that took more than twenty minutes to visualise. I can suspend disbelief and enjoy a good bit of tosh with the rest of you, but I'm afraid this was BAD. SO disappointing that SO many people fell for it. Are we this desperate for distraction?"
3,A Bit Icky,The saccharine flows a bit too thickly here. It's not enough to have a huge ensemble of couples all rushing toward the inevitable happy endings. The director has to mix in Christmas schmaltz on top of it all. Beware. Only for the rose-colored glasses set.
3,Okay movie. Certainly not worth all the hoop-la on Christmas Movie review sites.,"It's a nice little Christmas movie, but I wouldn't rate it in the top 10 or 20 Christmas movies like so many web reviews do. Some very suggestive themes - not one you'd want younger children to see."
4,I love this movie.,I am a dude and I am not afraid to say that I actually really enjoy this movie. It is the only movie in this sort of genre that I like. It does not take itself too seriously and the aging British rock star character is hilarious.
2,Bad Writing,"I did not find any of the character's even remotely likeable. There is little depth to any of the characters, not a feel good movie."
5,favorite romcom ever!,"Love, love, love this movie! Other than a few 'select' scenes, it is quite viewable by older teens and young adults as well. Cute, timeless stories and great acting. I had purchased it years ago and the DVD broke so I bought it again on Amazon!"
5,Excellent,"Wonderful movie about the ups & downs of love and ultimately finding a soul mate, in the most unique ways."
5,One of The Best Holiday Movies Ever!,You will love this heart felt holiday movie during the holiday's. This movie does a great job threading together all of the different story lines.
3,Great Movie,I love this movie but it took longer than I expected to arrive and the case was broken. It was smashed on both sides even though it was packaged with bubble wrap. The cover also falls out easily.
4,Great movie,"What a great movie! My adult daughter and I went to see it and almost didn't because she considered it a ""chick flick"", but humored her mother. Both of us were delighted with this movie. This is one of the few movies that I have seen lately that I would actually buy. Not for small children, as there are some pretty hot scenes, but a wonderful movie for adults. Shows you that love is alive and well in all it's many fabulous forms."
5,Great casting!,"I saw this film before Christmas and loved it! What great casting, all the great contemporary British actors are it this one. Hugh Grant plays a charming somewhat Tony Blairish Prime Minister with a great message. The film is endearing, sweet, loveable and very humorous. This is definitely a purchase for me!"
5,love actually,"Love actually is the best movie ever made! Its hilarious, and occasionally touching. It should be played every christmas...or even, better every week!! I can't wait 'till it is out on dvd. It deserves every award there is! Hugh Grant is the best looking thing that ever walked the earth, and he is fab in this!"
3,Not The Best Movie,"Love Actually had the makings of a great Holiday classic. It had Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson and so many great British actors and actreses. But with all the unnecessary nudity this movie stunk. Also if they had made some of the story lines longer than we could truely appreciate this movie. There didn't have to be nudity and this movie could have been easier to watch and have been a great movie. But the good parts was the ending because it was sweet and over."
2,not that great!!,"I really don't understand all these reviews with 5stars. I just came home from the cinema, and the movie really disseapointed me. There are far too many characters for you to care about. If they had cut the amount of stories in half, the movie might have been better. the only good reason for watching this movie are the good looking men!!!"
2,Stupid Actually,Too many stories crammed into one movie. And the result is none of them are developed very well. Too bad. Because some of them were worth embelishment and some could have been dropped altogether. Can't recommend this as a purchase.
1,Stupid Actually,"I just got done watching ""Love Actually,"" it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I was utterly disgusted! It made a total mockery of Christmas, with its ambiguous message--there was way too much sex and lasciviousness involved with the holiday celebrations. (Who in their right mind, dresses their kid up in some ridiculous lobster costume for the nativity scene?) It was blasephemous, vulgar, and completely gratuitous."
4,Cut the porn scenes and it would be a great movie,"I have seen this movie twice. Everything about the movie is perfect except the porn scenes with the two kids. Now being a woman of 24 I found this scene to be alienating. I get a little uncomfortable seeing women totally naked with my boyfriend who politely covers his eyes. The story had a lot going on but I never found myself lost. THe stories are plausible and real. I just didn't get the whole porn story. Maybe it's me being insecure but I would have given it 5 stars if I could show the movie to kids or my parents without feeling a little silly. I love and adore this movie, so if your competely at peace with tastless nude scenes then you will fall in love with this movie and watch it everyday."
3,Fun story but ...,"I saw this movie on TV with several scenes edited out. I loved it and thought it would be worth buying so I ordered it. My wife and I watched it when it arrived - the edited version was so much better! There were a couple of scenes that were close to soft-core pornography.I really liked the theme of several couples and the people they love; Hugh Grant did a great job - the concert at the end was a wonderful scene. Liam Neeson and his son were so charming - especially the running through the airport! And the man and his housekeeper who couldn't speak the same language was my favorite of them all.I like the movie, but I wish it had been toned down just a bit with the unnecessary nudity."
5,One of the best holiday movies.,"This movie has everything - comedy, drama, love. It is a must-see and you'll want to watch it over and over."
5,What a fantastic Movie!,"What a fantastic movie Love Actually is! Don't miss it. The fun, the music, the nudity, the tears, the laughter. Great acting by Hugh Grant and Liam Neeson. Everyone shines! One great big Christmas movie all wrapped up for you! I loved it as did my hubby. I will definitely see it again and bring the WHOLE family too! :) Merry Merry to all! Barbie"
5,Love Actually is actually fantastic!,"Love Actually was a breath of fresh air compared to all of the other ""Chick Flix"" that have been released lately. Movies like this one don't come along often and haven't since Notting Hill, 3 Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones' Diary. It is in true form to all of those. Bring your friend or bring your spouse-- I believe men will ""Love Actually"" this movie as well."
1,Quantity over Quality...,"The fact is, Love Actually gives viewers quite a few love stories, and it doesn't give the viewer time to connect. What is romantic? Romantic is seeing a couple fall in love, not 3035903509295208 couples talk about love. By the time the viewer may feel any connection to a character, a new story starts and the viewer is lost. I didn't pull one name out of this film and didn't get to connect with one character. Also, the pacing in this film is horrible. Right when a story might seem interesting, a new one starts and a new character is introduced.Love Actually tries to do too many things in a short time. The directing isn't that good and it's only saving grace is Hugh Grant. Also, a lot of the leads have no chemistry whatsoever. They just picked some top-notch stars and expected love. Sorry, but it just doesn't work that way..."
1,"Depressing and some spots humorus, but....","This movie starts out kind of pleasant, but soon becomes a drama with sad endings for some, and I would never call this a comedy. Every relationship has problems, and you walk away from viewing this with a great dissapointed feeling about Emman Thompson's relationship. The Ultimate romantic comedy as stated, should say, ""the Ultimate sad stories of relationships""."
3,Not as good as some say,"We rented this movie because it was highly recommended by people we knew as a romatic comedy. It was cute, but definitely not as good as the hype."
3,Not enough cats.,"I love cats, and there were far too few feline cuddlybumpbutts in Love Actually. While I was watching this movie, two of my cats did the cutest thing! They SOMEHOW ended up in the laundry hamper and almost knocked it over! I had to stop the movie for I was laughing my socks off. You know that look a cat gets when he knows he's done something wrong? Well, they BOTH had that look! Amazing!"
1,Just Awful,"I can't believe the British can make such an awful movie... I thought it was just a bad stereotype about them, but they really are just awful actors, the storyline is horrible. Ahhhhhh.. Don't waste your time, there is nudity and every other part of the movie is lacking as well."
1,Awful film! Awful acting! Incomplete story line! Yuck!,"For starters, and we were shocked at the unnecessary nudity. The lack of completion with the stories. We wanted to see this film because we like Alan Rickman. It was billed as a ""funny, romantic comedy"". It was anything but...Alan Rickman plays a married man who is tempted by his secretary to ""cheat mentally"" or at least to give her a Christmas necklace...this story ends with Rickman and Thompson (his wife) staying together ""for the children's sake""? Who knows? The story line is never finished...and that was the best of the stories in this film!What a disappointment! Would give it a ""no star"" rating if possible, but the lowest rating is a one star."
2,tedious,"This movie is like a spoiled brat lashing out in all directions without plan, without aiming and seldom hitting anything. Whoever said this was a feel-good movie was seriously disturbed. It is an exquisite study of British repression with a dash of multiculturalism thrown in.Give it to everyone on your Christmas list of the people you hate."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"After hearing the buzz about ""Love Actually"" I was very much looking forward to the DVD, well now that I have seen it, I can say that I was not very impressed with it. The various stories take place in the month in December in the weeks leading up to Christmas. For the most part, I found most the stories to be so unbelivible. The only one that seemed real was the story of actress Laura Linney character trying to find love while dealing with a mentally ill brother. That story was the only reason that I gave ""Love Actually"" three stars. But truly a movie that is not as good as the previews make it out to be."
5,Favorite Christmas Movie,I sent this movie to my daughter in college as it's her favorite Christmas movie to watch after studying and during the holidays. A great surprise for her to get this time of year!
5,Great Movie,"One of my favorites, Glad I got it. All star cast, and always gets me right there. 3 more words needed"
2,Lame,"Just plain dumb, trying to be coy. When your woman complains about a ""romantic comedy"" all the way through, you've picked the wrong movie."
5,Pathetically Awesome!,"If you want to laugh and cry at the same time; if you want to know you are not the only pathetic loser out there; if your capacity to love is so great, it is your biggest pitfall; this movie is perfect for you!"
5,Love Actually is one of my favorite movies of all time....,"I love this movie and can watch it over and over...and I do! Now, I'm happy to have it on my Kindle Fire, so it's at my fingertips!"
5,Love Actually DVD,"Fast delivery, item in perfect condition! This should be counted as one of the all-time great feel-good Christmas movies. Wonderful cast!"
3,Fun but bad,"This movie definitely captures your attention but is otherwise badly done. Try to sleep through most of it. One weakness is the large number of characters and you will find some difficulty in working out who they all are (or how they know one another). Hugh Grant is a disaster as Prime Minister and his infatuation with his secretary, and fight with the US President over her, is too bad to be even rated as farce. Colin Firth is believable as is Bill Nighy but I cannot imagine who wrote Emma Thompson's lines. Writer Richard Curtis has done better things. One feels that most of the actors just turned up for the day to do their parts and left; it's all rather disjointed. Rowan Atkinson does his best but he is obviously just there to help sell the film as is Liam Neeson (who came to the studio with that perpetually bored expression of his).The ideal drink to help enjoy this movie is a good sedative."
5,Love Actually is WONDERFUL!!!,"This is the BEST ""feel good"" movie ever!!! Everyone should watch it....afterwards you will want to call all of the people that you love, and tell them you love them!!!"
4,"enjoyed it, i'd buy it....","man, writers are really running out of ideas in the genre of romantic comedies.whats different about this movie and why you should see it? nothing new, but all the characters and storylines intertwine. many complain about this saying theres too much going on at once, but i feel thats what makes the movie charming. touches base on every kind of love.would be a movie i'd watch again."
5,Love Actually,"Really enjoyed the Movie,arrived right away and in great condition.Thanks for the excellent service.Sincerely Ann Pisarek Dutton"
1,Emotionally Detached,"Let me start by saying that the cast was impressive and that was the main reason for watching this movie. How bad could it be?This movie goes all over the place. The characters are not developed and therefore we are left empty and not caring one bit for these people. One reason I believe we don't connect is that there are way too many couples in this movie. Don't get me wrong the movie has potential but how can we possibly feel for over sixteen people when it's only a two hour movie?The only couples I feel that needed more attention were: Emma Thompson's charcter and husband, Laura Linney and the guy she had a crush on. If you watch the movie you'll understand why. Emma's character has a stronger story and Laura Linney's character had to deal with an emotionally unbalanced and needy brother. We could have seen more as to how she was going to deal with this and still have a life.All other characters were wasted and pointless. Such a great castwasted on this nonsense."
3,Ok..very funny if you have a british sense of humour,Being English i found this film funny but it definitley had some things it could do with out..if your still not sure i would consider renting it when it comes out on dvd..
2,"Disappointing, I am sorry to say","First, let me say that I am a big fan of British movies and especially a big fan of Colin Firth. Therefore, I rushed to see the movie. What a disappointment! It seems to be very diluted, like a series of storylines that are best dealt with in a soap opera. What were they thinking, these capable actors? Each role is barely sketched and stereotypical. I am really sad to write this review, since I know it is going to impact their viewership, but I felt so betrayed in my affections, that I had to say it."
2,I watched an 'edited' version...,"and thought the movie was interesting and entertaining. And it contained many favorite actors. Then I read an online review about the vulgar sights, scene and sayings that had been removed from the version I watched. How disappointing. This movie stood on its own WITHOUT tons of nudity or language. I also didn't realize the foul language used by the Liam Neeson character in talking with his stepson. Watch a cleaned up version if you can."
2,london actually....,"oh boy, this is a doozey of a flick.the only couple i was drawn to was that of the guy who hooks up with the portugese cleaning gal. sweet.the rest was garbage."
2,"Good story, too sexed up","The ending of the movie was wonderful, but I would have enjoyed this movie much more if it hadn't been so sexed up. The sex aspect did not contribute one tiny bit to the ""love"" focus of the movie, in fact, it highly distracted from it and cheapend it. Get real movie makers...start making movies we want to feel. The old standby that ""sex sells"" is getting old. This movie is just littered in bad taste."
5,best movie I have seen in years,"I cried at least 4 times, clapped my hands (out loud in the movie theater) and I was not the only one. At the end, I felt like giving it a standing ovation..but held back (it is a movie after all).this is the best movie I have seen in a long time. Completely romantic for all ages, for all genders...my boyfriend even liked it (so it is not just a chick flick)I wholeheartedly recommend itEnjoy"
2,"This movie didn't make me ""feel good""","The only two ""real women"" in the movie (read, over 30) have unhappy endings and yet all the men, young and old alike, have their wildest fantasys come true. If you like to see 50-something men end up with women half their age, this is the movie for you. Maybe I'm just mad because I didn't like how the Emma Thompson bit turned out. What the heck happened? I never figured it out.The only reason this gets two stars is because I like Colin Firth. But he is only in about 1/10th of this movie, so don't get too excited!"
2,Very forgettable snack of a movie.,"I found this movie very disappointing. It tries so hard to be cute and funny, stuffing over 5 different love stories into one short movie. What we get is a set of underdeveloped one dimensional characters, underdeveloped plot lines, and ultimately a very forgettable romanitc comedy. Frankly, I felt it was a waste of time and money. The only redeeming parts were Colin Firth's appearance (although he was on camera far too little) and the cute love story with the little elementary aged boy and his crush. Some stories that needed development were left to shrivel up. All in all, it is a snack of a film, like eating one M&M...sweet but woefully unsatisfying."
2,"good cast,boring storyline","The cast was good,but the acting and storyline was dry.At times I dozed off to sleep or would hit the VCR's fast forward button to find a good scene.If this is suppose to be a comedy it didn't make me laugh.If a future version of this movie is to be made I would urge the writers to make this movie a good one."
5,Even my manly husband liked it.,"I can't stand most chic flicks. I hate saying outloud to the characters in a movie ""why don't you just say/do {insert logical suggestion here}"". What I love about this movie is that it is sweet and sappy but not in a manner that makes me want to shove my finger down my throat afterward. The film takes a look at several different angles we see every day in relationships and not all of them are happy nor are all of them ever resolved. The humanity included, however, is what appeals to me most.Unlike critics who see this film as a dramatization of commercial Christmas at its worst combined with weak writing, I see several fun, imaginative, (even if not believable) and witty dramas tied up in a nifty little package. I love the dry humor and the music is thoughtful and appropriate."
4,"Don't listen to the ""professional critics""!","This is such a great movie. Take someone that you really care about and go see it, you will appreciate him or her that much more. This is an enjoyable, fun holiday movie for adults. Hugh Grant is great, absolutely hilarious (think Bridget Jones or Two Weeks Notice)."
2,Love Actually,Poor story line. Some great actors & actresses but i was disappointed in the quality. I won't buy before viewing a DVD again
1,Horrible waste of time,"I watched this on a recommendation from my sister. I'll have to talk to her.This movie was a disjointed collection of little relationships, none of which really had any magic or interest. There were random relationships thrown about without any real underlying theme or story. Many of the interactions were just plain stupid. And why the porno stars having on-screen naked intercourse and oral sex? Love Actually is a typical example of an attempt to pull together popular actors and actresses in a weak movie. I'm glad we only rented it. I definitely wouldn't recommend it."
1,0 stars 0 stars 0 stars,"If you think cussing Brits and gratuitous nudity are cute, then this is your movie. The problem here is that these actors and writers *actually* believe that they are cute and witty. Incredible, really. The result is a steaming bucket of excrement.I have some burning questions:1. Will Hugh Grant ever take on a role in which he portrays someone other than himself?2. Will the Brits ever get over their fascination with the word f*ck?3. If people have so much money that a piece of garbage like this can *actually* be funded, may I have some please? I'll do some good with it."
1,"Tasteless, Actually","This movie pulled out every cliche you've ever seen. The ""run after the departing girl at the last minute"" cliche was done not once but three times. The film used old pop music top-forty hits to establish moods in a very heavy-handed, distracting, and unimaginative way. And, in addition to being insultingly anti-American, the movie was so male-oriented, it was almost misogynistic. Most of the female leads played paid servile employees of their male lovers. The women in this film NEVER say ""NO"" to male attentions even if the woman just married someone else. And female employees flirt with their bosses by turning their office chair towards him and spreading their legs as widely as possible. This movie has all the subtlety of a pile driver but is far less interesting to watch."
1,This Movie Sucks,"I just couldn't get into this one. It was trying to be all things to all people, and the reason i like about a boy and most of hugh grant's other movies is because they have a decidely british feel and look. That's why people like him he's very british and handsome. We don't want him in a stupid american love story thats why bridget jones diary is so good, its very very british, and thats why notting hill was good hes just the lovable brit, u have to cast him as the ""lovable brit"" in a british type of film or u will fail!"
1,LOVE ACTUALLY IS MISSING,"DESPITE MY TITLE FOR THIS REVIEW, LOVE IS ACTUALLY PORTRAYED IN THIS MOVIE.........BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE MOMENTS ALL OCCUR IN THE OPENING AND CLOSING SCENES THAT SHOW REAL PEOPLE EMBRACING AT AIRPORTS.........INBETWEEN, WE HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF WITH THIS VERY TALENTED (AND ATTRACTIVE) CAST TOILING MIGHTILY TO CONVEY, NOT LOVE, BUT OBSESSION AND COMPULSION, IN THIS......WIERD......MOVIE. THIS FILM MAY HAVE MORE AWKWARD AND EMBARRASSING SCENES THAN ANY FILM MADE TO DATE..........EXCEPT FOR THE SOULFUL EMMA THOMPSON, AND THE VERY FUNNY BILL NIGHY (REPRISING HIS GREAT ROCK SINGER SCHTICK FROM THE UNDERATED FILM ""STILL CRAZY""), THE CAST IS WASTED, THE SOUNDTRACK (WHICH MUST CONTAIN EVERY LOVE SONG EVER WRITTEN) IS WASTED, EVEN CHRISTMAS IS WASTED IN THIS..............WIERD...........MOVIE."
2,Actually Awful,"I enjoyed the other movies by these talented filmmakers. Noting Hill--Great. Four Weddings and a Funeral--brilliant! I am very sorry, however, that I was so high on those films that I went ahead and bought the DVD without first screening the movie on cable. There are TOO MANY characters and storylines. This means no character is given ANY depth. It's awful, cliche, and sickeningly sweet. The ""bad"" girl secretary is actually wearing devil horns as part of a costume in one scene--sheesh, how juvenile and obvious can you get? Are these the same minds that created the other brilliant, touching, biting movies that I loved? If so, then all I can say is that they were so busy trying to push ""agendas"" that they forgot how to tell a story well. Characters are left at loose ends or given ridiculously forced cheerful endings to their stories. Just awful. Waste of time and there's some really nasty attitudes toward America too. I want my money back."
3,A cute and tender comedy,"Comedies are not my thing. And anything labeled a romantic comedy has me cringing. But the cast of this film had me curious. Its all actors I admire. And I must say, its a unique type of movie. Its not overly funny and its not really angsty. But it deals with so many different emotions and events, its just great to sit back and enjoy it as a whole. I know this will be one of those Christmas classics that people watch every year."
5,Should have won an Academy Award,"Extraordinary humor, wide-ranging samples of love, romance, sex. Not just a chick flick! Nine stories interwoven, including a prospective relationship between a Portuguese gal who doesn't speak English and an Englishman who doesn't speak Portuguese. Very well done, touching on all of life and love, from the very youthful to death. Should have won an Academy Award. Warning: do not watch this film with children under age 18, nor with your mother-in-law."
4,A hidden Christmas Classic,"This is a great British comedy. It could be a sleeper Christmas hit. I forgot how good it was till I saw it on cable and then I knew I must have it. IF you want to laugh out loud and be drawn in to the lives of 5 strangers whose lives all intermingle, its for you!"
5,The best romantic comedy EVER,"I won't embarrass myself and say how many time I have seen this gem, but this is one of the best films I have ever seen - funny, sweet, touching - the whole package and standout acting. Do yourself a favor a snag a copy for you and a loved one."
2,Not feeling it.,"I love all the actors in this movie but I just didn't believe any of the characters loved each other. (Except perhaps Liam Neisen and the kid) Also,despite there being a child in the film, DO NOT let your kids see this movie! (...)There were a few bright shiney bits in this movie, but overall, the characters were so hastily drawn that most of them didn't feel authentic at all. A good rental, but I am sort of sorry I bought it."
1,Love Actually,"Ghastly vomit enducing pseudo middle class fluff. A bad sterotype on British people being such twits: let me tell you your more likely to see Hayleys Comet close up, than London snowing.Hugh Grant is not a english gentlemen, he is a shallow floppy haired creep!The House Of A Thousand Corpses is less unpleaseant than this!"
1,A clumsy empty mess,"In the past, writer Richard Curtis proved a brilliant writer of witty dialog. But he's not particularly good at constructing funny situations. And he's terrible at building a passable reality or an interesting fantasy. In this movie, which is under his direction as well as his pen, he also proves to be a poor acting coach, an all-thumbs editor, a tonedeaf musical director, and, overall, just, inept.The movie is endlessly pointless. The characters are engaged in nothing serious or funny -- instead these talented people are acting through a suffocating hollywood-like porridge of boiled-down life-crisis moments. The off-target result just makes you wonder where these non-people came from. The movie is not sweet. It's not funny. It offers such badly drawn cartoons of life, that it achieves no mood at all, nothing of which I could approve or disapprove."
1,horrible,I love Hugh Grant and was looking forward to seeing this film. I was sickened to actually see it. Why wasn't it X-rated? I left with a pounding headache. Just awful.
1,Too much distraction,"I had heard so much that was good about this movie, that we went ahead and purchased it to watch together on Valentine's day. What a shocker! First, there are just too many storylines to keep up with, and then there is the sex... if your idea of a romantic comedy includes sex and sexual innuendo, then this is for you. I found the scenes with the porn stars to be offensive and unnecessary. The references to sex, and even with a young boy being sexually obsessed with a girl, was just too much for me.And then there is the language. Again, if you can get around the F-bomb being dropped every five minutes, then you'll love this movie. I understand that maybe the British have different standards for use of language then some of us, but this made it just horrible to listen to, much less watch.I would say we made it about less than an hour into the movie before we turned it off.I think this could have been done in a way that was much more tasteful."
1,"shallow; too many plots, not enough substance","I guess the point of this movie was supposed to be Love Overload, sending women into an overdose of estrogen with every romantic turn. Any one of these plots might have made an interesting movie, but each is chopped down into something about as substantial as a 30-second commercial. Most romantic movies only ask you to endure one or two cheesy gimmicks, but by the time I saw a marriage proposal accepted between two people who barely knew each other at all, I had reached the end of my rope, and I realized that none of this was anything like real romance.Without disdain, I can advise that if you're into the cutesy shmaltzy stuff then you may love this movie. The actors are superb with what little they've been given. (LIAM NEESON MARRY ME!!!)"
5,A Feel Good Flick,"First I'm a total Anglophile, I love the U.K. and many of the movies made or set there. This movie is even better than Notting Hill. A jumble of many stories, every one is entertaining, heartwarming, funny, you name it. A fantastic cast tops it. Please, for those still in the dark, ignore the full screen edition. I have no clue why DVD's are even made in the full format. Listen folks, you do not see the entire picture in full screen! That was the big mistake VHS made when it came out, every thing was pan and scan. I never understood that. Back to the movie, get it, it's wonderful."
4,Love is better the second time around....,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband who is a Hugh Grant fan and knew that he had enjoyed this movie when we saw it in the theater. Although I seldom watch a movie more than once, especially one I wasn't that crazy about the first time, I decided to watch it with him again during the Holiday break. Well, I must have been in a bad mood during the first viewing because I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It is a must for Hugh Grant fans!"
4,Still sorting it out.....,"Just saw the movie...11;45 am showing and theater was pretty full..LOTS of characters and some took up time from more interesting and more realistic characters...think it will overall be popular, but will cause lots of discussions...which is a good thing..LOVED the lack of makeup and fearless actors showing lines and wrinkles...American actors would never do that...but who can hold a candle to Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson...it is quirky....go see it...bet you will like it..."
3,Nice Christmas movie,"The start of the show was a bit dis-jointed and far-fetched. I enjoyed ir once, but have no desire to see it again. Glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater."
4,"love the movie. got a blue ray for Christmas, this was one of the first movies we got!","we got a blue ray for Christmas, this was one of the first movies we got! great movie and recommend!"
2,Terrible movie,"SPOILER ALERTOne guy is in love with his friend's wifeOne guy is in love his secretary, even though he's married...with children(bottom 2 images on dvd cover)The old musician confesses his love to his managerIf the above is for you then maybe you'll enjoy this flick.I wanna try and like this movie because of the decent cast, but I just couldn't...it's just too aggravating."
5,Best chick flick ever.,"Love this movie. It has everything: it's funny and smart, great acting. Love it, love it, love it, love it."
2,Disappointed,"Even though the story in this movie has merit, I think the portrayal of some of the scenes was inappropriate. The sexual portions and foul language were not enjoyable. I was told this was a great movie and it could have been one of those you want to watch often. I guess I didn't notice that it was an R movie, but if it wasn't it should have been. The purchase and ordering experience at Amazon were great."
3,Good little film,"The start and end of the film takes place at Heathrow, where a montage of people being greeted by their loved ones is lent poignancy by the opening narration of Hugh Grant stating that all the known messages left by the people who died on the 9/11 airplanes were messages of love and not hate, and the closing song of the Beach Boys' God Only Knows. Also effective is the use of cameos in the film, most notably as dream babes such as Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards, and Shannon Elizabeth make brief appearances in the airport as love interests for some of the diverse characters, who we see now have known each other in casual ways, each with different takes on love.Is Love Actually a film that will challenge you the way 2001: A Space Odyssey does? No. But it is a film whose well-written and acted characters and charm will stick in your mind long after their counterparts from lesser, schmaltzier films in its genre have faded."
5,A Must Buy!,The story lines were incredible and it's a movie that gives hope. The cast line-up was also great! Definitely something to watch over and over again.
4,Love it,I love this movie. I think it is so funny and it is really intersting how it follows all the different lives.
4,Love Actually,"This movie can be respectively called the oddysey of all romance films. An epic of romantic proportions this film focuses on a number of romantic relationships that are all linked. Set in the beautiful city of London the movie is charming and spreads the Christmas spirit. It will make you want to fall in love. Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth are hilights of the movie. Laura Linney and Keira Knightly also have good performances. All in all it is a good movie for adults to watch in the holidays. The DVD has a few features and a great transfer."
3,A feel good movie,"Sweet movie of love, love and some more love. Many stars and quite a few side stories makes it interesting."
3,"Too much going on, actually","This movie follows the romantic ups and downs of at least 8 different people. It has many nice moments, but ultimately it suffers from trying to follow too many plot lines. You only get brief glimspes into any one of these stories so that it is hard to get too emotionally invested in any one of them. The film is packed with talented actors, but few of them get to really show off that talent because they have so little to work with. So while it was a nice movie, I felt at the end that it could have been so much better if it had been pared down to following about half of the characters, particularly Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and his son, and Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. Still, I'd say this is worth a rental."
5,"I love this movie about love, actually!",I love this movie. It still amazes me when I mention it to a friend and they tell me they have never heard of it. Do yourself a favor and enjoy one of the best romantic comedies ever made.
4,Perfect Christmas film for adults,"My daughter has a very very small part in this film, so we were luck enough to be invited to the cast and crew screening in London.I did love this film. It made me cry, laugh out loud and I left the Theatre with a smile all over my face. The film has 8 intertwined stories, which all come to this fantastic ending, that makes you feel good about the world. There is a fare amount of nudity, all of which is of a sexual nature, Although this is very funny I just thought it a little out of place compared with the rest of the film. The shame is because of this, it will be a good few years before my daughter can see the film she appeared in (she's only 7). Not every one of the stories has an unrealistic happy ending, this makes it more believable and leaves you wondering what happens to the characters next.I do recommend people who believe Christmas to be special to see this film. It's a perfect Christmas film for adults."
3,"Surprisingly funny but unoriginal ""rom-com"" [3.5]","Loaded with superstars, Love Actually is an enjoyable, funny romantic comedy. It's definitely entertaining but lacks substance. Yes there are serious bits intended to tug at the heart strings, but they're all but swallowed by the comedy. At the risk of sounding anti-American -- I'm quite the opposite -- much of this film's charm is that it's very British.As other reviewers have said, there's quite a bit of Four Weddings and a Funeral in Love Actually. It follows that same formula. If you're looking for something fresh and original, this film's not it.Others might chide me for being prudish, but some of the nudity and adult language, especially the cursing by young Sam, was entirely unnecessary. Some of it, though, was funny. No matter how you feel about that sort of stuff, the movie's probably not suitable for younger viewers.This is a movie that both men and women can enjoy, especially if you're looking for something light-hearted."
1,Yuck,"I expected so much more from this terrific cast, but I was sadly disappointed. The film is severely marred by unnecessary explicitness. For those of us who prefer not to watch porn, we don't appreciate the filmmaker's attempt to insert it here under the guise of a sight gag. It's still offensive. Also disappointing was the storyline with a stepfather and young son constantly talking very explicitly about sex. Beyond inappropriate and utterly depressing. Don't waste your time like I did on a flawed film whose pretty package disguises the ugliness beneath."
1,Seller was dishonest,"The seller of this movie did not deliver on-time despite being paid for - and when package arrived late, it was missing the return address so that I could receive a refund. What a disappointment!"
1,Really Bad,Worst movie I have ever seen. I can't believe this great cast played in this movie. A bunch of shallow relationship and unrealistic characters.
1,Boring and crap actually,"Wow another Wooden non Oscar worthy performance by the most wooden of men, Yes you've guessed it, Hugh Grant. The British always curse and put down awful performers like Hugh Grant but never seem to pick on he's incredibly crap acting, the man sucks. As for movies starring this hack then I can assure you this really sucks. Why do the British keeping making these god awful romantic comedies, they never work and are never funny. This is a movie for grannies and losers so if your neither then take my advice and watch something else."
1,A feel-good flick for fat girls,"Hugh Grant falls for a girl with a large bottom -- fat girls around the world can now feel better about themselves.Right... this movie tries hard to be uplifting, but in the end it is simply insufferable.Nowhere near as good as ""About a Boy"" -- easily Hugh Grant's best film -- or even ""Notting Hill.""Pass on this load of hooey."
1,"not a ""romantic comedy""","i asked for this movie for Christmas, specifically to see alan rickman. i was highly disappointed to see him play a middle aged man with a wife of 13 years and 2 school age children who decides one night in the sack is worth a $500.00 gold necklace -which he gives to his secretary of just a few weeks(while he gives his wife a cd)-and his family life - this is a comedy??!!mr. rickman is much too good an actor to settle for this dribble of a part! now, if you want to see him at his recent best-check out the first harry potter movie where he plays severus snape, potions master and spy, in a subtle, sexy performance."
1,"Weird, vulgar, and baaaaad. Only Billy Nighy is fun.","Very vulgar movie.Not a movie for families. Even the parents swear with their children. This is a very bad british movie. But what can you expect from them? Only in America, the Christmas movies are mostly actually not objectionable.All the characters are stupid. Colin Firth adores a woman who cheats on him with his own brother, how stupid is that? A woman who just got married is the object of love for another man, how inspiring is that? A widower talks about his fantasy date with a slizzy model at his wife funeral ...The only redeeming part : weirdly enough it's Billy Nighly!"
1,Shallow and anti-American,"Is it funny or charming? Well, this film panders to anti-Americanism, the new religion of the world. American girls are portrayed as loose bimbos; the Prime Minister is given kudos for stickin' it to the nasty American President. The plot is shallow and so are the characters. Don't say you weren't warned.Those who absolutely loved this film are encouraged to mindlessly click on Not Helpful :)"
2,British comedies keep sinking lower and lower,"This could have been a good movie if some of the stories had been left out. I'm not a prude but the couple simulating sex scenes really was awful! It definitely deserved the ""R"" rating. I'm glad I watched it alone as I would have been embarassed. Some of the actors/actress were great like Colin Firth and Hugh Grant and that's the only reason I gave it any stars at all."
4,Love actually is THE movie you have to see if you're feeling down!!,"I saw it first on TV and I was so intrigued by the concept that I watched it fully. At the end, I was amazed. For once, all the stories didn't end in a good way, which is rare. The movie shows all the kind of love you can feel (for you brother, for your co-worker, for your family, ...). It's a very good Christmas story, and even if at some point you can think the movie is a little cheesy, well, at the end, you just feel good and full of love to share.The actors are all very good british actors, which make the film even more intense. Well, if you're feeling down, just watch love actually.Oh by the way, the story with Colin Firth is one of the best. Just watch it."
3,Too Cute,"Excellent talent holds you to the end of this story, which would have looked ok on a stage, but the contrived feel ultimately disappoints."
5,Worth buying for Hugh Grant fans,"If you like Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill, this DVD is actually worthy buying, not just renting. It is actually a better movie than I had expected based on the reviews, and the commentary by Richard Curtis and Hugh Grant (as well as Bill Nighy and the child actor Thomas Sangster) is excellent: perhaps actually more entertaining than the movie itself and extremely informative. It's worth it just to hear Hugh Grant make snide remarks about Colin Firth (actually very amusing). Also interesting to learn that one of the scenes in this movie had actually been originally written for Four Weddings and a Funeral.The deleted scenes on the DVD are also actually very interesting. The movie was actually editted down from an original 3 1/2 hours. If Curtis had been allowed to actually release all the junk he had filmed it might have actually ruined his career (the original climax with Thomas Sangster doing elaborate acrobatics at Heathrow is awful, actually)."
5,Didn't Want it to End!,"Okay, I'll admit it, I went into this film with super high expectations, as Notting Hill and Bridget Jones Diary are two of my all time favorite movies, but I was so totally smitten by this movie that I had to write my first review to share with others. I've never seen a movie that so adeptly dramatizes the many forms in which love affects us. Each (main) character (not counting the silly little parts played by the nude stand-ins) was so earnest and ""naked"" in their utter surender to the reprecussions of true love, that it broke my heart while making me laugh all at the same time. Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!"
5,Love it!!!,"Great movie. I can watch it over and over. Makes me cry everytime I see it. Love to watch it around Christmas, since it is a Christmas movie."
5,Beautiful!,"One of my all time top ten! See it whenever you feel down. It is funny and heartwarming and your worries will disappear.Rent it first, if you don't believe me. Then you'll want to come and buy it too! :-)"
5,Perfect Christmas present,"I laughed, I cried, it moved me! It had everything. The cast is utterly incredible and you really live their situations it so well done! Many of my all time favorites doesn't hurt. Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, the list goes on and on. It breaks your heart, but also fills it up with love!"
5,Excellent movie that considers holds the human condition with seriousness and humor,"This is an excellent romantic comedy. However, it is much more than that. It takes the psychological threads and complexities of relationship and weaves a wonderful tapestry that illuminates the human condition while it entertains. I laughed many times during this movie and other times was nearly moved to tears. It is an excellent movie to revisit at Christmas time and it is complex enough that it can stand up to repeated veiwing. The acting and writing is also suberb and it has the flavor of a good foreign film blended with the best characteristics of a U.S. film. At the price they are selling this film for, it's totally worth the risk to buy it if you haven't seen it. It's heartwarming... engaging... and delightful in every way. You won't be disappointed unless you are looking for very light entertainment with little substance (which there is a place for in my book as well)."
2,stupid actually,I can not say what was more stupid about this movie. It's amazing how shallow everyone was in this picture. They all claim to love each other but really they would not know love from a night out with a call girl.
2,Very Disapointing,"I like romantic comedies, so I thought this film would be just the ticket, well I was wrong.There are a few (and I mean a few) funny moments, but they are interspersed with too many ordinary & unfunny will-they-or-won't-they typical scenarios and dialogue that we've seen a million times before.Some of the deleted scenes are actually funnier than the movie itself!If only they had included these scenes and had, well, a LOT more humour, then it would be a great comedy film.As for the romance - erm - very weak quite frankly. The film flits between different 'romances' but the chemistry between the actors on screen is zero. Its all very predictable, OF COURSE certain people get together at the end, yawn. And what was with that waste-of-space storyline of the man who loved the black man's wife, that wasn't finished, nothing happened with it!I've given it 2 stars not 1 because of the (albeit sparse) funny scenes."
5,I actually loved this movie!,"i thoght this movie was so fun! i went and saw it with my mom (because i'm just 14) and she loved it too. it has alot of nudeity in so its not the best if you want to take your kids. and the plot line is so cool, because all of the storys are some how connected, so that makes it really cool. ohh, and also, see this movie if your a hugh grant fan;)"
2,Pass on this one.,"This is one of those movies that you really want to like, because it's always on the cusp of being funny...but then isn't. Also, the nasty little U.S. bashing politics should've been left out. I found it offensive. Liam Neeson is wonderful, as always, but the movie is definitely a ""rental"" only."
5,Love this movie,"One of the best romantic movies ever made. Wonderful stars, fantastic story lines. Love the way the characters are intertwined"
5,I love this movie,It has amazing actors and is a great drama as well as offering a lot of laughs. Hugh Grant does a dance which is adorable. This is a great holiday movie; I watch it every year around Christmas.
5,Nice Feel Good Movie,"This movie is a great look into the lives of regular people. I love the way it concentrates on several stories at once. It is funny, light hearted, sweet, and happy. It's a great date movie or chick flick."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:As long as you don't take this modern-day fairy tale literally you'll have a heck of a time; combining laughs, romance, and a bit of pathos into one of the shortest-seeming 2+ hours movies ever made, Love Actually is well-worth checking out."
1,One of the worst movies ever!,"What's with all the sex first of all? There's no need for any of it. Secondly, what was the point of the movie in the first place, love? It was a bunch of couples cheating on each other! It was not a good movie at all and I recommend Lost in Translation over this! Don't waist your money!"
2,Not enough Hugh,"Somehow when I rent a DVD ""starring"" Hugh Grant, I expect to see a lot of Hugh Grant. Silly me! In this ensemble effort, he is in just a few scenes, playing the Prime Minister of England who is inexplicably attracted to a foul-mouthed female assistant. If that's not enough, there's a couple starring in a porn film who are too shy to even kiss on their first date. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this movie can't decide if it's concentrating on its R rating or trying to be a feel-good movie. It tries to do both and doesn't succeed very well in either effort."
2,Great acting but Very Antifeminist,"I don't mean to be deliberately narrow-minded when I say this movie made my skin crawl. I went into the theatre excited to see Emma Thompson in a new film role and I left extremely angry at the limited roles women play in this film. They're all seen through the lens of the male and this angered me particularly.Love portrayed in this film is not ""love actually."" It's still love according to Hollywood. The lovers are all beautiful physically. Their situations are idealized--even Emma Thompson's, whose husband cheats on her--and characterization is nil.Skip this movie and watch ""Sleepless in Seattle"" instead."
2,It ain't that good.,"Before I sat down to watch this film I wasn't really expecting much and what I got was what I expected. Love Actually is over-long-I was bored by One hour and thirty minutes, it could've been rapped up- it is far too sentimental, Andrew Lincoln? Cheesey! The beginning was so unthoughtful, making a speech about the Two Towers. What happened to Laura Linney's story?In short do not waste the money to watch this film, wait till it comes out to rent and get your mate to rent it for you.Anti-America was quite enjoyable though."
4,Love Actually DVD,"I love this movie because it's so poignant, but still very British in its humor. Multiple story lines come together at the end, and it's about true love, so how can you go wrong?"
3,Shlock Actually,"The British are still trying to find that 1930's to 1950's style, Golden Age romance for the Cinema. They spruce it up with modern mores, bed jumping and adultery, sprinkle a little adult movie moves, add a chubby, Monica Lewinski love interest for a single Prime Minister that looks a lot like Tony Blair, add mental health issues, and bingo, ya got Three Weddings and a Night to Remember.What's all this mean American President business? Now that the Magic, oh forget it, the new Democrat is President: America is sensitive and kind."
2,I just didn't GET it,I am surprised at all the hoopla about this movie. Got through the first couple of scenes and turned it off. It seemed to be nothing but a bunch of blah blahblah.....we watched Calendar Girls instead..now that movie ROCKS!
2,Could have been SOOOO much better!,"I was very disappointed with this movie! It had great potential with an outstanding all-star ensemble cast.Unfortunately there is an over-abundance of profanity, semi-pornographic nudity, and strong anti-American sentiment!Whoever thinks these sort of things enhance a movie is sadly mistaken."
3,Overcooked,"The sole redeeming qualities of this film -- other than Hugh Grant dancing -- are the beginning and the ending. The story is soft to the point of mushy. The characters fall in love predictably and with as much melodrama as two characters running towards each other on the beach in slow motion. I found the stereotypical European anti Americanism to be irritating. While the beginning and the ending have a feel good quality, I found the film to lack inspiration."
2,"Love Actually, I don't think so.","Love Actually is somewhat sweet romantic comedy. I like the story between Hugh Grant and his tea lady and Laura Linney and her much younger beau but the rest of the stories were tepid. Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley ruin this movie, over-rated and stuffy actors who make little or no impression whatsoever. And those stupid scenes with those adult film performers really make this film feel forced. Love Actually is more about lust and misunderstanding than love. This one you can skip."
5,pure entertainment,i've watched this film multiple times and loaned it to friends who have watched it multiple times. one reviewer dissected the movie and seemed anoyed by the racial overtones. poor soul. if he only new that in most of the rest of the world people judge each other on character and personality not the color of their skin. get this film and you won't regret it. i think it's one of the best romantic comedys ever made.
1,Awful,"After 20 minutes of watching this film, I knew that I had had enough. Vulgarity for its own sake. Poorly directed. No respect for some fine actors, who should be ashamed of themselves. It's a far cry from Four Weddings and a Funeral."
1,Greatly Disappointed,"This movie disappointed me greatly. I love Hugh Grant, but this movie hurt me. It was slow and not heart-warming and romantic. The only part I adored was Hugh Grant, dancing around the Palace. Other than that, I loathed the Porno actors scenes and the Guy who liked his best friends wife. The entire movie was a let down."
4,Basically Charming,"Love Actually presents a series of charming tales underscoring the variety and persistence of love. As the plot unfolds new love is contrasted with old love and lust with betrayal. Some scenes are taken to believable excess but most remain in the romantic comedy reality. If you watch closely I bet you find the love you have, the love you once had, or the love you long for."
5,A Christmas Classic!,This year I bought DVD's as Christmas presants. I choose Love Actually because it is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has a wonderful cast and is really enjoyable.
4,"Bored, actually","I think that if this movie had been made with only American actors and taken place in America the critics would have slammed it as just more Yankee treacle. Does giving these sitcom-ish characters accents elevate this flick to classic status? I think not.It is a lightweight, forgettable, date film. Rent it."
5,I actually loved Love actually,"What first pulled me into the movie theatre to see this movie was all the big names. A steller cast doesn't aways mean a great movie, but in this case it was. It was good for it's audience. Some material could have been deleted from the movie (like some of the swearing and the scene between the body doubles) but you have to remember this is English humor. It is funny, but it wouldn't be for a 12 year old. The different stories are all woven together to make a good movie. Whether or not you decide to own it depends on your own taste, but it is definatly worth seeing once."
2,Only a Diehard Fan of these Actors Need Apply,"Personally, I do love all the actors. But, I felt like the characters were not fleshed out as much as I wished. I felt like I was left hanging because I wanted more out of these people. Yes, there are some really funny parts to this film. But with so many actors and so much action going on, I wish there was fewer to concetrate on and as I say, more to be fleshed out.Personally, I would perfer Bridget Jones Diary over this and even some Sense and Sensibilty or even Emma with basically the same actors in them."
3,Watch it for Thompson and Nighy,"Emma Thompson and Bill Nighy steal the show in Love Actually and rise above the rest of the cast. Thompson is wonderful as the stay-at-home mom who has to confront the fact that her husband is romantically interested in a young officemate; her performance is a combination of sweet, wry humor and deep hurt. Then there's Nighy, as a crude and raunchy ex-rocker who, in one of the movie's best scenes, shows that he has a heart... and a love for the most unexpected person!The rest of the film wasn't as great as I expected it to be. The jokes were not all funny, and the numerous storylines made the movie sort of shallow; it had a glossy, frosty, holiday feel to it."
2,Well . . .,"another reviewer said this is very percussive without much melody. True. I love highly percussive IDM but this is only interesting enough to listen to once straight through. As soon as you're done listening you've forgotten what you've heard. Everyone is annoying and disturbing (and part of the reason I returned the disc) where a guy says over and over again: ""I want to kill everyone, Satan is good, Satan is our pal."" Maybe it was funny in The 'Burbs but taken out its context and radomly placed in a song makes it disturbing and completely unneccessary. Miss June is the only awesome track and I found I played that over and over again but the rest is mediorce at best.Rumor has it that this is aphex twin. If so, shame on you Richard. If not, then you'll do better picking up an aphex twin disc. And hey reviewer down below, leave Warp records alone. Obviously you like mediorce music like this."
3,darkman is back..for round three.....,"this movie is a great popcorn muncher!! sit back relax and enjoy...although not as : powerful"" as the first one it still has a decent plot my only gripe is the dvd ..there are no extras period not even a trailer or anything talk about bare bones..still if you liked darkman one and 2 which i thought were excellent pick this one up just for the film.."
1,Don't even bother with this one,"Yet another attempt to try and make a Darkman sequel, this one is worse than the second.Vosloo returns while Fahey is the bad guy and is horrible at it. No wonder it's direct to video. A BIG waste."
5,FANTASTIC!,i totally loved this movie! it was by far the best of the 3 in my point of view... a really emotional ending! brilliant!
3,"I wanted to hate it but after watching it, I kinda liked it.","I loved the original film but never wanted to give the sequels a chance because I didn't like that the actor was replaced from the first film. Even though hes different, He's passable and the story, action & special effects are decent for a direct to video. looking forward to watching darkman 2 now."
3,Forget the title,Despite the corny title this is actually a decent movie. The performances are good for being a direct to video so is the storyline. Those who liked the first may find this to their liking.
2,cool hero made bad,I AM A DARKMAN FAN I HAVE ALL THE MOVIES AND ALSO THE COMIC BOOKS BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS AND DARKMAN 2 ARE HORRIBLE WHEN COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL.ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE THIS IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS DIRECT TO VIDEO CAN GET.
2,Soap opera with sex scenes,Not one of the better examples of this genre. I don't know whether other country's versions are different to the Australian version but there was an obvious section of the film cut out (not the first time I've seen this happen).
3,Good Fun for Many,I enjoyed this film. It had all the fun of a romp.Phil Lewis was very good for his first outing. He played the sinister doctor with aplomb. Vic Martino was also quite good. I loved his scene chewing.Good harmless fun for all.
5,elixir of bliss,"if this cost less i would drink it every single day. as it is, i order it and make it last by cutting it on a pot-by-pot basis with lipton yellow label (i like strong tea.) bright, beautifully red in the cup, full-flavored and delicious, really, a black tea drinker's elixir of bliss. and the tin is not bad either . . . we accumulate them over time and fill them with home-made christmas candies to give away, but only to people we really, really like:)"
5,Excellent Black Tea,"This tea is exactly what I was looking for in a morning tea. Strong, well balanced flavor with no aftertaste."
5,Wonderful delicious tea,I discovered this tea at a grocery store in Paris several years ago and have enjoyed drinking it ever since. It has a dark robust taste that I like better than English Breakfast Tea. Highly recommended.
3,Good for beginner,I had supposed that it would contain more on marketing. It is a good read or those starting in the field.
4,This one'll light up the Hollywood sign,"Another homerun for the Eros crew. Great looking girls, hot action (the hot tub scene with the two models is arguably the hottest scene of any Eros title.Run don't walk to see this one. But don't waste your time on the rated version. As with all of these titles, the real action is in the UR versions."
4,Great Christmas Memory Album!,"The format of this journal is very flexible -- you can use it a bunch of different ways to record your holiday memories. It's very sturdy and has held up well over five+ years. I have really enjoyed looking back and remembering things about past Christmases that I might otherwise have forgotten. But be aware that it is chock full of Mary Engelbreit drawings. I've been able to get past it because I like the format a lot, but others may find the cutesy artwork a bit much."
2,"Lord, help us if Emma ever finds happiness","This is a must read if you are into the Alpine series. However, Emma Lord must go it alone. What's next? Will the author kill off Milo???"
3,Great plot; questionable ending,"I would have given this book 5 stars if it weren't for the ending. The Alpine series is a well-developed series of books with three-dimensional characters, vivid descriptions, humor, and excellent plot-lines. I always look forward to each new entry as I did this one. This book did not disappoint with regard to the above-mentioned characteristics. The citizens of Alpine are so realistic, I feel as if I know them, especially Emma and Vida. This book was a page-turner from beginning to end. So what's my problem? The ending. Without giving anything away, I felt that what happened was not true to the tone of the series or fair to Emma. Usually this series is more upbeat, a very attractive feature. However, the ending in this book was downright depressing, and I don't understand why it happened. If you're a die-hard Alpine fan, you may feel as I do about this part, but still enjoy the book. I do recommend it."
2,Nemesis Indeed,"I've read all the books in Daheim's Alpine series and loved each of them . . . up until this one. The plot of Alpine Nemesis was great and the storyline, well developed, but the ending was unexpected, uncharacteristic, and downright depressing. Daheim's audience is probably ninety percent women, most of whom read for the sheer pleasure of escape from the realities of life. What was Daheim thinking when she wrote this book? I do not recommend Alpine Nemesis, and am very reluctant to read Daheim's next book in the series for fear that it'll be a downer like this one."
4,Expected more from Emma,"The Alpine series is fantastic reading. I have enjoyed all of the Emma Lord mysteries. The ending to this book, however, was disappointing to me. I had hoped that Tom would have just ""one more family crisis"" that would cause him to again leave Emma. Then, after struggling with all of her emotions from all of the years past, she would decide that she needed to move forward in her life without Tom, without looking back."
3,Fun for a while.,"For a couple of days this is fun but after a while it gets repetitive and annoying.I haven't touched (literally) my tamagotchi in a couple of months. Kindergarten has NO GAMES; school has one very confusing game andit doesn't get a job for so many weeks of waiting. And constant mini-game-playing. The graphics are poor for today's technology, everything is low on technology."
1,A waste of money,"Tapes are very difficult to follow. They are done in a very fast monotone. The font of the written text is too small for anyone to really see. I bought it and tried following it several times. It was just too frustrating to continue. I have found other tape series that are fantastic, like the Pinnseuler. I highly reccommend that one. This one will end up in the garbage pail unless you are a keeper of useless junk."
5,Incredible!!,"If there was any question in your mind if you are a deeply emotional person, just listen to this. If you cry, you are. After listening to this for 5 seconds, I was crying like a baby - it's so unbelievably touching it's hard to describe in words, you merely have to experience it for yourself first hand."
1,Rite or Passage,"I didn't really like this book. It was kind of sad in the way that Johnny was adopted and he couldn't live with the same family over a certain period of time. I thought it was a little racist how the author had the gang be kids who were black and the victim, someone who was white. There was also a lot of fighting in this book, and what I really didn't like was how Wright ended the book. He ended with Johnny falling into a troubled sleep thinking about the woman who was yelling for them to stop. He said that Johnny just wanted to go home, and quit the gang. It didn't seem like the right ending for a book like that. I wouldn't recommend this book to a student who always wants a happy ending, that's for sure."
4,Rite of Passage,I enjoyed this book. I got attached to the characters and I didn't want to put it down. I was refreshed by this book because mecause the main character made one bad decision after another. My only objection is the ending. But after a litle thought I was able to cope with it.
3,Rite of Passage,The book Rite of Passage was really interesting and exciting because it's about a boy who has lived with the same family all his life until he's taken away by a different family. Then he runs away from the family and then joins a gang. The best chapter of the story is 1 to me because it is when Johnny is told that he is being taken away buy a new family there is a lot of emotion. Then when his new family comes to pick him up he does the last thing he can think of and that's run away and he does. This book would be really good for teens because it's about a teen who runs away to join a gang. I would give this book a three out of five because of the ending and its really short.
3,review rite of passage,the book was a little strange but it was interesting. I would recomend it for any one that likes a short book that will keep them interested. the book has its own twist on life and it works for the author. this is the only book that i have read compleatly.
3,A.S. Wold Studies Rite of passage,"The book rite of passage by Richard Wright I thought was interesting and easy to follow. It was adventursome and was exciting. It was also short and easy to comprehend. the book was very discriptive and gave me a good picture of what each caracter was like. there was a ten-page fighting passage that was suspensful because the caracters kept on trading off winning. the book made me relize how good i have it, a family,a good school, and a good place to live.Overall I would recamend this book to kids 14 or yunger because it was easy to read.Also to people who like aventursome books this is a good one."
3,AS World Studies review,"I thought that Rite of Passage was definately not one of Wright's best works, and certainly wasn't of comparative quality to the rest of Wright's works. Rite of Passage has an excellent plot, but lacks in-depth character development and description; the book isn't very substantive. If the book were longer and more developed, it would be a worthwile book to read. If your looking for a good Richard Wright book to read, try American Hunger, or native son."
4,good detail about empires,"this book is a really good stuff.it has very detail description.althoug the author forgot to add few informations,but is still good."
5,Readable and Comprehensive,"Clearly the result of exhaustive research, this book takes traditionally very dry material and presents a highly readable text that identifies fascinating perspectives on the American Dream.Recommended without reservation."
4,Excellent characters,"This is the third ""Dogme 95""-movie following 'The Idiots' and 'The Celebration'. A very charming story with excellent actors and a cute kid. Very funny indeed"
3,Mildly entertaining.,"Mifune is the story of two brothers who have been estranged due to an escape by one brother, and also the story of a young prostitute and her teenage brother whom she has lodged at an expensive private school. All four characters are united in this tale of people trying to escape their origins for what they perceive to be a better life. How they come to appreciate their true selves and each other is the driving force of this film. In some ways almost too simplistic, it is nevertheless a success in its telling. The film is set in a pastoral scene and in some ways is reminiscent of COLD COMFORT FARM, a film that is far superior to Mifune."
1,Is there a minus star? AWFUL!!,"Bad movie, bad quality, bad cast, bad lighting, bad script and did I say just a bad movie??? If you are looking for a fantastic movie with the same plot -- see SHOWER. The Chinese did a superb job on the story of a man who was ashamed of his roots after his success (including his retarded little brother). See SHOWER- -it will touch your heart!!Shower"
3,"Lovely, funny film!","""Mifune"" isn't a great film, but it sure is fun to watch. Part of the Dogma 95, the first comedy made under those rules, it is sort of like watching leafs falling off of threes. You find it beautiful, but at the same times, it feels like death. And that's what Mifune is all about. You never quite know how to feel about this film, but at the end you feel a sort of loveliness in your heart, and that's fun. Iben Hjejle( who also had a role in High Fidelity), is quite impressive as Liva a prostitute who finds herself the maid of a man and his brother who is somehow retarded, in the house that their father lived in. As the story grows, Liva's brother comes to live with them, and that's when the theme of the film lifts. ""Mifune"" is really about brothers and sisters. Though it doesn't exlpoit it at its full credit, at the end of the movie, you understand those people and their relationship with their brother or sister. That's a good thing."
5,Mifune,"Here's a movie that was excellent, about accepting people for what they are, and accepting yourself. The four main characters in the movie did an excellent job in portraying their character. A movie full of fun, exciting and a lot of laughter. You may find yourself in one of the roles exhibited. A great foreign film."
5,to who said that NOFX sounded like Green Day and Sublime,"Not all punk is Green Day. Not all Ska is Sublime. Neither sounded anything like Green Day or Sublime, except for perhaps punk and ska pickings"
4,Decent,Earth Crisis doing a Misfits cover?? Wow... WEIRD but very cool. Some of the covers I din't like but I am more into the metal/HC scene. Punk/ska fans would probably give this the extra star.
2,Not for piano,"This book was not what I was hoping for in terms of piano music although it may be good for guitar and vocal. Quite a few of the songs are just the background music w/o the melody line. I only enjoy playing about 4 songs from this book - wish I had bought the complete book of one of his solo albums like Blue Turtles or Nothing Like the Sun (but didn't, so could be the same issue!). Do we really need the Puff Daddy Remix of Roxanne? I don't think so."
3,"Good yet, not excellent.","This is the first negative review I have posted on a book. This book is excellent for piano, but for guitar? I think not. I thought this book would have tablature and chords, but unfortunately it only has chords. Don't get me wrong this book has excellent chords, just no tabs. For those who play piano and rythm or solo guitar this is a good choice. But for lead guitarist, look else where. Thank war veretans for all the have done for us. HOO-YAH!!!!"
5,Lonely on the Mountain (the Sacketts),Louis L'amour books have been around for a number of years. I remember my Uncle reading these books back in the 1950's. He is a great Author and any of his books you purchase I am sure you will enjoy. He wrote about the West as it was when it was new and wild. I recentally purchased 5 0f these books for my Grandson. He is thrilled with them.
4,"Eleventh in the series. Good entry, not the best.","Sackett brothers Orrin, Tyrell, and Tell team up with old sidewinder Cap Rountree to help out cousin Logan by driving a herd of cattle up north. Lonely on the Mountain is full of characterizations and adventure (even though the cattle drive doesn't start until halfway into the book).Of course, not everybody is so nice as to allow a bunch of Sacketts to get away with doing family a favor, so the boys know to ""expect Higginses,"" as they say (meaning to expect trouble).Not a terrific entry in the series, but certainly worthy of the L'Amour brand."
4,VOTE FOR DVD RELEASE!,"HEY, BR>SET IT UP SO PEOPLE CAN VOTE TO GET THIS MOVIE PRODUCED ON DVD!!THIS IS A HARDCORE WESTERN, IT ROCKS! HARDCORE VIOLENCE, AWESOME DIRECTING. RELEASE IT ON DVD!! VHS IS TERRIBLE.PETE"
2,Poorly packaged,"The plastic tension disk in the center was broken, allowed the pieces as well as the DVD to slide about inside the sealed case. It was loud enough that clearly someone ought have noticed it. Such a condition made for awkward gift giving."
1,WTH?,"This movie tests my ""suspension of disbelief"" over and over. I can't get past the pirate costume, the shaved eyebrows and mustache...so...West Hollywood. Bizarre in a stupid way. Even the horses are ""costumed"" wrong--the saddles used are all post-1940. What a joke. Sorry. This movie is lame."
5,One of my all time favorite western movie.,"The Last Outlaw, definitely one of my all time favorite western movie. This great production was make possible by the filmmaker of the originalThe Hitcher. It's was those day when HBO make incredible TV movies with amazing cast members. In this case with Mickey Rourke the star ofThe Wrestlerand Dermot Mulroney who work onMy Best Friend's Wedding (Special Edition). The story is really good with a great memorable villain play by Mickey Rourke how steals show from the fist minute he is on screen. What's make this western movie different from others movies? I describe it as a western movie mix with a strategy war game chess and a lot psychological twist. It's definitive a must see and one of the best HBO Films."
3,An oddly diffrent book.,"I liked this book, although the auther went on a tangent after about one paragragh. He would be talking abuot the main story line, then all the sudden (blah blah blah means blah blah blah. I hope you don't think I mean blah blah blah)then back to the story line. Sometimes in the middle of the sentence!It has its funny moments though. I say go read ""The Series of Unfortunate Events""!"
2,Not a good book at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I didn't like this book because it was boring and the bigging stunk. I read all of the books and that was just a waste of time. It got confusing in so many parts.
3,"Fun read, but a bit to much like A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS...","With the popularity of J.K. Rowling's HARRY POTTER series and Lemony Snicket's A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS,many children's authers use similar elements as these two authers (e.g. Jenny Nemo in the CHARLIE BONE series). A HOUSE CALLED AWFUL END,I am sorry to say,falls under this catogory. As in ASOUE, the circumstances are unfortunate and yet the tone is comic. The book is light on substance(and at times plot) but this won't get in the reader's enjoyment of the story. Thanks to the delightfully wacky story and deliciously ecentric illustrations,this is a fun, fast read althogh a bit more suitable for larger libraries.RATING:B-"
5,"A beautiful, dharmic and profound book.","Sharon Salzberg has written a beautiful and profound book about practicing the dharma, living the dharma, and spreading the dharma. She relates wonderful stories of her own experiences, many involving the great spiritual teachers of our day. I was continuously inspired by her writing. I highly recommend this book for anyone who'd like to have an inspiring spiritual book around the house. The best part of the book is that it is written in 1-2 page chapters, each one an immediate hit of pure dharma. So, I can just flip the book open, have a quick read, and come away very happy. A great book, indeed!"
3,Keys for Writers,"It is okay, good condition, but it was not the one I needed. I was looking for the 5th edition and after delivery I saw it was 2nd edition"
4,Synth Rock Period Piece,"Human League is mostly remembered for their smash single ""Don't You Want Me,"" which was unavoidable on pop rock radio when it first came out in 1981. As a result, most people probably think the band was a one hit wonder with little substance. Surprisingly, ""Dare,"" is a strong album that pioneered the synth rock sound that bands like Depeche Mode and New Order would take to much bigger heights. That the Human League was more than just fluff is shown by a song like ""Seconds,"" which mourns JFK's assassination. Other standout cuts include the ballad ""Open Your Heart,"" and danceable ""Love Action.""Overall, a synth rock period piece that trascends the era in whcih it was released."
5,A early synth-pop masterpiece!,"I also remember buying this LP in high school and was immediately taken by the energy this music had. Although ""Don't you want me"" is a good song. The songs "" Sound of the Crowd"" and "" Open your heart"" were top 10 in the UK for weeks before this album hit the U.S. For those of you synth enthusiasts, I would recommend another band with similar styles such as Heaven 17 with their self titled album. They had a monster dance hit called "" Let me Go"". In fact two of the members from Heaven 17 used to be in the Human League prior to ""Dare"" and wrote the songs"" Things Dreams are made of"" and ""Love Action"". This music is pleasurable and is what dreams are made of!"
2,This album has exactly one good song.,"This album has exactly one good song, ""Don't You Want Me."" Actually, it's a great song. But the rest of the disc is filler material. What a shame."
1,"Love Verdi, hate this version","If you love the Verdi Requiem I believe that you, like me, will be disappointed with this version. It surprised me to hear a spinkling of wrong, or fractured, notes in prominent spots. Rehearing these passages is like walking with a pebble in your shoe - it gets more and more annoying - even painful. Considering the DVD recording medium and the date of recording, it is also woefully poor quality. Stick to one of the older recordings and you stand a better chance of being satisfied."
5,And you thought that your final exam was tough,"Rod Walker had one final exam left before he graduated high school but it was a tough one. Rod and his classmates were going to be dumped in an unknown environment and those that survived until pickup a week or so later passed. The test was difficult enough but Rod had never considered what he would do if the pickup never happened. When it did not the surviving students began to group together for protection. As time passed they began to accept that rescue was not going to be coming, and began to form a new society.This was one of the 'juvenile' novels that Heinlein wrote early in his career. Fans of his work will recognize themes that would emerge in his later works. Heinlein would revisit the idea of forming a new government in THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS, Lazarus Long would set out as a pioneer in TIME ENOUGH FOR LOVE. As is common with a Heinlein novel aspects of this straight forward adventure novel will keep the reader thinking for years to come."
5,Disturbingly brillant,This book left me thinking and disturbed for days afterwards. Simply amazing. Heinlein captures you and sucks you in completely.
4,If you like Stargate,"If you like Stargate, or liked Sliders, then this book is for you. A group of students set out for their final exam of sorts to prove they can survive in a, what they think to be, controlled situation. There short test quickly turns into a deadly situation where they find themselves isolated and not sure of when they'll see home again, or if they ever will. If I described the book anymore I'd really be giving away more than I wish to. All I have to say is, if you like Heinlein, like Stargate, and/or like Sliders... this book is for you.-Ryan M."
4,Another Heinlein Juvenile Success,"This is a Heinlen Juvenile that is not set in the 1940s SF Solar System. Instead Heinlein uses ""Star Gate"" style technology, without Ancient Egyptian mumbo-jumbo, to send humanity to planets surrounding alien stars. The basic story is about some young people marooned unexpectedly while on a field trip.There is a resemblance to _Lord of the Flies_ but Heinlein is a much better writer with a sunnier, although still not too sunny, view of human nature.The central character seemed annoying in some respects the first time I read this. However, his good qualities overshadow his flaws. Now I realize that he is fairly consciously creating his own flaws. He is a young man with heroic goals and those goals twist his character somewhat.This story predates the ""Star Gate"" film or TV shows but it is likely that Heinlein didn't ""invent"" the technology either. It is a very tempting idea."
4,"For a teenage boy, it doesn't get much better than this.","This is classic sci-fi/adventure for the adolescent reader. The futuristic setting, the action/survival theme, even a hint of sexual tension -- what more could a teenage boy want in a book? And if it sounds as if I'm being tongue-in-cheek, I'm really not. I loved this book as a teen, and got a lot of enjoyment reading it again a couple of decades later."
2,Not so impressed. I wanted to be though.,Old mans war and the forever war are hard to replicate. The premise was excellent but the campy story was too much.
1,tunnel in the sky,Robert Heinlein is a well know science fiction writer so i assumed tunnel in the sky would be fairly well written. Boy was i wrong. The premise of the book was interesting however the characters and dialogue were not believable. There was no flow to the story. It was as if the book had been written by an eighth grader. Save your money and do not buy this book. Big disappointment.
1,Annoying,"I bought this book based on the other reviews posted here. I was hoping to find a new author--and maybe genre--to enjoy. If this book is typical of the best sci fi has to offer, it will be a short relationship for me. Dialogue and characters werew wooden, no sense of ""place"" whatever was created, the plot was modest, and there was little originality in the ideas. I bought three other Heinlein titles at the same time--I hope they are less tedious."
5,Caught my Child's Eyes,"Our son has a budding interest in astronomy and a nine year old's attention span. That's okay b/c he is nine, btw. This book is definitely visual enough to pique his interest in ways that other astronomy books could not. His father (the astronomer...) is thrilled. The photography is quite simply lovely and provides a different perspective on what is up there. I generally use that ""other"" part of the brain, but even I was quite engaged. Maybe not terribly technical, but it's a start."
2,"Sometimes clever, but incoherent","I heard about this from a friend of mine, and went to go see the show. Some moments were okay, but not a lot of thought was put into the plot, characters, or lyrics. The vocal performances are not terrible, but certainly the actors were not cast for their singing ability. File this under ""Could've been quirky and inspired, but instead was flat."""
2,"wretched, yet intruiging","sort of like seeing an asian transvestite gyrate on the bar counter- you don't want to watch, yet you can't look away."
5,"Original, Insightful and Inspriational",Eleanor and Tom have written a classic. It's about time someone has taken the role of women in high political office seriously. I'm buying copies for my daughters and nieces.
2,It's acceptable at best,"This book is written by a team of two authors and it shows. The book often seems disjointed and repetitive. It lacks polish and feels more like an undergrad term paper than a serious, analytical work. The information is interesting, but it lacks any serious examination of the policies these women pursued and it has serious omissions. It sticks with women in Congress, but fails to examine other powerful women such as Madeline Albright, Sandra Day O'Connor, or Ruth Baider Ginsberg. In the end, the book seems myopic in its approach and fails to show any evolution in the role of women in politics over time. You don't get anything here that you couldn't get out of Ms. Magazine."
4,Cute - Runs Small,"These are so cute. It's hard to find a flip-flop with a heel for my 5 year's very small foot - but these were too small even for her. She wears a 8 or 9 in shoes, but her heel hung off the back of these. Disappointing since I can't find them in a different size (or color) on Amazon."
1,Broke after a few uses,I purchased this for use in a high school chemistry class. After one use the top came off and I could not screw it back on. The base is also poorly connected. I would not buy this again.
3,Fire Syringe Craftsmanship,"The Fire Syringe works as intended, demonstrating the principle of Adiabatic Combustion. But the one I ordered broke from the base because the threads were not long enough, and therefore screw-in far enough into the base and broke after a few uses. The tube still works, but now requires glue or epoxy to affix it securely."
3,Fire Syringe,This item was purchased for a college professor. I do not know if he has used the Fire Syringe nor what he thinks of it.
2,disappointing after reading thumbsucker,"another reviewer has already covered the plot pretty thoroughly. i didn't really end up feeling anything for the characters, though i really tried to like the protagonist. it seems promising at first, but after the first eighty pages or so it just drags along. it builds up all kinds of events, but then seems to try and wrap up too quickly - which in this case was a good thing. i had to force myself to read the last thirty pages rather than skimming them.the only thing that really recommends the book is the humor in the first half of the book - specifically a scene where one of the elders gets work as a secret shopper at a thinly disguised walmart."
1,Supplier dishonest.,This provider offers what is not in inventory or in the state that offers it.This item corresponds to a memory kit Kingston brand and I bought two kits.They sent a single pair of a different brand than the bought and not a new article is used.Was asked to return the kit did not send this provider and never processed the refund with Amazon. For this reason I am denouncing this dishonesty.
1,OOPS,MY MISTAKE FOR ORDERING ECC RAM AND NOT RESEARCHING FURTHER. IFT WAS NOT ADVERTISED AS SERVER RAM. SO I ORDERED IT.
5,Great case!,This is the best case I used for a PDA. I had a leather case before and it just wasn't good enough. This case I could carry with me and not worry about my Zire 71 being scratched or broken or being turned on by accident. This case is very tough and doesn't have any of this flimsy things in it that could brake from above average use. It even has removable clip that attaches to your belt. It felt very secure when I wore it. This is the best case I used.
3,Wonderful beach book,"Malone's skill with prose -- and knowledge of southern women -- are well doemonstrated in this wonderful collection of short stories. While not the stories are not all of the same even level of writing, there is a good range of character types and plot twists to tease and stimulate the imagination. Malone is a good story teller. Some of his lines are memorable -- and quotable. Enjoyed reading it."
3,"Oops, got the wrong album, buts its pretty good britpop anyway","I downloaded this album thinking it was by the post Minor Threat, pre Fugazi project by Ian MacKaye, my bad. And much to my suprise I got some emotive britpop that sounds kinda like a mixture of Verve, Oasis, and Radiohead circa The Bends without the emotional despair. Very nice, melodic and thoroughly enjoyable music by some guys who aren't afraid of a beautiful melody and anthemic songs. Not bad, if a tad formulaic, but its a very pleasant listen so what the hell?"
2,Disappointed,"Before I bought this album, I hadn't really heard Embrace before with the exception of ""Fireworks"". And as far as ballads go, I thought ""Fireworks"" was one of the best. When the debut finally came out and some critics were heralding it as ""the best debut since the Stone Roses"", I rushed out and bought it. It starts out good enough, the first minute of ""All You Good Good People"" is unabashed pop brilliance. But as the song (and the album) progresses, it just turned into a disappointing run-of-the-mill rock album. I honestly coudln't see what the hype was about. After giving the album a chance, I eventually stashed it away to gather dust."
4,the best cheat sheet for art history class,"Finally figured out what to say when walking into an italian church or museum and have to explain to friends what this or that is all about. Always wanted to know why christ is holding an apple or why there is a bird on the corner, or why this saint is holding this particular object. Could have given it 5 stars, but held back, since the names of art and literal references are all english-based, with little mention of the original names in italian or latin. The illustrations are of superb quality, and so is the paper and book binding."
1,Pricing,"I have not actually had a chance to review this book, but I just had a family member tell me that they saw the same exact book at Barnes and Noble for around $10.00 which means it is priced too high here."
3,Missed an increasing trend,"The book does not discuss an increasing trend. Children as caretakers of parents in their own homes. Failure to discuss in detail the devastation of losing elderly parents when they were part of your most immediate family for a long time is a huge minus. There are three such relationships in our extended family, an uncle and two aunts living with their children. They plan to die at home.Lost my Mother less than two weeks ago after living with me for over ten years. This book didn't help me. It is simplistic and logical. That's the problem, logic isn't appropriate when we are thinking emotionally."
4,Justifying my feelings,I really felt that this book helped me justify alot of feelings I had concerning my dad's recent passing. sometime I question how I feel and this really helped me give validation to the thoughts and feelings I was having. The only thing I disagreed with was how a daughter reacts to a mothers death. My mom passed away 25 years ago and I think the passing of my dad is a lot harder for me. Could also be because I am older and not having small children to tend to like when my mom passed. I do recommend this book.
3,A guide for Adults-When parents die,"I did read this book, I felt it was lengthy in content, someof the content was not that well written or I didn't understandthe usage of the content. I did not find it as well written as other books I have read on Grief and Bereavement. But it mayhelp you with the understanding of grief.I wasn't impressed with the book overall as I had initiallythat I would be.Not bad, just wasn't really what I was looking for."
1,Disappointing,"I found this book disappointing - not as helpful as I'd expected. For me, there were too many details and short anecdotes but none explored in any depth. I found it frustrating to read. Also, the book doesn't mention what happens in blended families when a parent dies - for example, the issues that affect the children of the deceased when there is a step parent involved, as well as step brothers and sisters. While the book covers many topics, it focuses mainly on the traditional nuclear family and assumes,the children are adults."
1,not much use,"I read this whole book. And once I was done, I still was left wondering, what now. It really hasn't done anything for me..."
5,Illustration Masterpiece,"If you're like me, you look forward to the illustrations in each issue of Playboy. They are not only witty, but masterfully rendered and executed. This book is a wonderful collection of the best illustrations Playboy has published."
1,Didn't work,"I have NO idea how to use this thing. I wanted to make chocolate bottles, but it didn't go together well whatsoever. Folding it didn't work, so I cut it and that didn't work either. Oh well!"
5,Very helpful book!,Both an informational and instructional book. This book gave me a good understanding about the theory and history of infant massage. It also explained thouroughly the technique and benefits of preforming infant massage. Madeline and I have gained many enjoyable and memorable hours of massage from this book.
5,Super!,"Love this book...it is very encouraging. I like ""Holding Time"" just as well...although the basis is different. I like the similarity. A great read for anyone interested in bonding deeper w/ their children."
4,Helpful Book,"This is a very helpful book. Good instructions for infant massage and how to help relax fussy and colicky babies. It is a little difficult to understand how to properly execute all massage techniques from book, but I couple the instructions in the book with You Tube video to better understand how to perform infant massage on my daughter."
3,Disappointed,"Although the book was ""new"" as in unused, it was very old and yellowed. I did not realize it was an old issue"
2,You need to have some prior massage exprience,"Purchased this book for my sister, who is a first time mom. She had great difficulty in following it. The set up is confusing. The illustrations lack any directional guidance. You need some massage background to follow the written instructions. There is an overwhelming amount of initial instructions that can be a bit intimidating. If you're a massage therapist, this book will be a great addition. If you're a first time parent, with very little time, find another book. Furthermore, the paperback will not stay open while you try the massage moves, so you need someone to hold the book."
5,Wonderful Book,This is a great book on baby massage. I started giving my son massage when he was having gas issues. the techniques in this book worked on helping to relieve his gas and get it moving.Now that he is no longer having these issues we have continued using the massage techniques - it calms him and gives us a great bonding experience. I highly recommend this to all new moms!
5,one of my favorites,"This film is one of my all time favorites. I think it's because these kids remind me of my friends and I as kids - riding our bikes, going on little adventures, etc. The cast is absolutely perfect. Wil Wheaton was the best crying kid of all time - with the exception of Ricky Schroeder in The Champ. LOL. River Phoenix was excellent in this film, which is an adaptation of a Stephen King short story. Part road film, part coming of age tale, all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings."
4,Dr. scrunchys review,"I thought stand by me was very good, especially for it's year. I thought the acting was great, especially river pheonix. It had a great beginning, middle, and end also. I just think there could have been a tiney bit more action. But it was very good. I think all kids should see it, even if it's raded R. It's important for kids to see."
5,Great Movie .. Recommended!,"My mother and I decided to rent this movie after watching the TV show, I Love the 80's. I think it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's basically 4 boys and how they are best friends. They go out on a 2 day adventure to find a dead body, but they uncover some horrible truths about themselfs and their lives. With Corey Feldman and River Phoneix, you cannot go wrong. The movie was humorous and heartbreaking. You laugh and you cry. This is one movie that I will always love, and never mind watching again."
3,pretty good but it could have been better,"this is a good movie for adults and kids.the one reason i liked it was because it has Corey Feldman who plays teddy so the movie rocked.it could have been better.but why was it called stand by me? and it didnt have that much music in it,either.but still good"
2,Stand By Me lies down,"Four 12-year-old boys go searching for a dead body. When they find it, they have to fight off a group of older boys. Not much of a story, though I guess it's not meant to be, but rather a study of the four boys. One is smart, another is a take-charge type, the third is an odd-man out pudgy type, and the fourth is the victim of a psychotic father and not too bright. The problem is that one minute the kids sound like slob-mouthed 12 year olds and the next like adults in an O'Neill drama analyzing their ""ruined"" lives. Not very believable--or it tries too hard to be and fails, which is worse."
2,You've got to be kidding.,"This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other. When does that ever happen? The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids. What 12 yr. old worries about ""..never getting out of this small town.""?I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense. I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie."
5,Stand By Me,"Personally, Stand By Me is in my top 10 movies and stories. When I compare movies that were written based off of novels, This movie would be in my best list. The script, very correctly portrays the characters that were written in Stephen Kings novella. The cast couldn't be more perfect for the characters they were supposed to play. Will Wheaton for Gordie, acted the sensitive kid to a tee. The movie made me reminice for a childhood I will never know in my generation, and be glad for the opportunity these children (I know they're fictional) had to discover who they were, and where they wanted to go in life.Seriously a great!!!!! movie. (Even tho I like the novella better)"
5,I Love It!,"I love this movie. It's my favorite. I first saw this movie when I was little, but I didn't know the name of it until this past year. I've seen it a bunch of times since then."
2,Great movie but horrible sound quality,"Stand By Me is a great movie with solid performances all around including several future stars like Kiefer Sutherland and River Phoenix, in one of his final roles. It is truly a excellent adaptation of Stephen King's ""The Body"". However, I can't believe they even bother making DVDs (especially ""Deluxe"" editions) without including a 5.1 dolby digital audio track or even better, a DTS digital audio track. This edition of the movie only qualifies as a 2 star because of the ridiculous mono soundtrack. What were they thinking? What a joke, the soundtrack CD has better quality sound! A fun movie which would have been 4 stars with a decent audio transfer."
5,Great Movie - Especially the train part!,"I really liked this movie! I don't think kids cursed like that in the 50's-but then, I dunno! My favorite character of course, was the Chris Chambers kid...he looked REALLY good. My mom told me he died. Oh my God. Well, at least he still has a living brother, that dude from the Gladiator. The best part had to be when they were crossing the bridge and then the train came and they had to run as fast as hell so they wouldn't be squashed to death. Another one of the best parts is when Vern drops his hot dog-I think-into the fire.... then they all crack up. I think maybe I'll buy the movie!"
1,do not recommend,it keeps pausing i havent been able to even watch the movie.i want a refund or i will never download a movie again esp. if they dont improve them
5,One of the Best Movies Ever,"I absolutely love this movie! It's one of my favorites and I could watch it over and over. It's got good plot, good acting and great child stars. I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE to hasn't seen it yet (if there is any such person)."
4,excellent movie~~~~,"This movie is very interesting for me. Because four young boys showed their friendship and morality with undergoing all sorts of hardship. Second reason, everyone's character is funny especially Teddy like a psycho. And each character made harmony altogether in this story. First of all, each boy's character is good, nice, and innocent. They were very young but they kept friendship and morality. Besides they helped each other for their friends. I want to emphasize that is better point than normal adult."
5,A gem of a movie,"This is a movie worth buying. With a genuine feel, the story rings true. I also like it because in the plot, there isn't clutter. It hints at things and gradually enlightens the audience as it progresses. (Rather than hitting you over the head with a sledehammer at the start and dragging out the next 2 hours. Which seems to be the popular trend these days.) Classic, timeless, and will look great in your collection."
5,Very good and sentimental movie,"This is my favorite movie. I really enjoyed it. River Phoenix, and Jerry O'Connell play their roles extremely well."
2,where's the actor's commentary?,"Would it have been so difficult to get the three remaining leads together to provide a commentary track? You're better off getting an older edition of the same movie at your favorite big-box store for $9.44. I seem to recall the soundtrack CD was only 30-some minutes long (those old songs were pretty short) so if they're going to include an audio CD, why not the WHOLE soundtrack? Seems like a rip-off to me; too bad the studio phoned it in, rather than actually make a worthwhile product."
4,Not for kids,"I thought that this would be a great movie to watch with our 12 year old, since it is based on that age of kid, and I remember the story fondly. I found out quickly that it is not appropriate for this age group. All of the swear words used frequently, smoking, etc. After shutting it off and watching something else with the kids, mommy and I watched it and enjoyed it tremendously. I do remember the short story, or novelette titled ""The Body"" (Stephen King) being slightly better than the movie, but this is a classic."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A maudlin movie which coasts on a wave of pure nostalgia to its shattering anti-climax of a conclusion, Stand By Me is inexplicably beloved despite being a completely forgettable film: unless you happen to love the song Lollipop or want to see lots of boys crying and hugging, stay away."
3,Not Very Good,"Four boys in a small town in Oregon set out to find a dead body of a kid who was killed quite a while before. On thier adventure, they discover something that they never knew existed. That is thier extreme friendship. They all help each other out in this movie. It's deffinetly not my favorite movie, but if your looking for a film to see because you can't find any others. I'd try this movie."
2,"Stephen King top, stand by me flop","It is one of the most boring film, I've seen by Stephen King. There is nothing horrible inside. I think that most of the watchers, which find this film great are very young. I love Stephen's psycho thrillers, but this film hasn't got something, which makes me anxious. It's more an adventure film for children. To sum up: Stephen King top, stand by me flop!"
2,I DONT KNOW WHY......,"TECHNICHALLY THIS IS A EXCELLANT FILM,I DIDNT LIKE IT.A STORY ABOUT A GROUP OF YOUG FRIENDS WHO GO ON A ADVENTURE TO FIND A DEAD BODY OUT OF CURIOSITY.I FOUND THE FILM TO BE BITTY,AND TIRESOME.I WOULDNT WATCH IT AGAIN."
5,"Great Movie, I cried watching it.",I haven't cried since I was 11. I am out of college and working now. This movie brought back my memories of my best friends in elementary school and what we experienced together. It is a must see.
5,stand by me review,"Dear reader, stand by me is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. River Phoenix is wonderful in this movie. He can just go in there and do his thing. He works so well with Wil Wheaton. Rod Riner did a great job at all the sceens. This movie has excitement, adventure, you'll laugh you'll cry this movie is so wonderful."
4,"Teen actors have Great talent, and they finally show it.","You've got all these terrible teen comedies lately with kids just trying to get some money with a movie of no integrity, and here comes River Phoenix who wants to be more than some lowly comedic actor, but an actual actor of integrity and talent. This movie is great. It is great for discovering how to be a kid , and how to deal with that. What's strange about this movie is you don't know why, but these guys have got to find the body. Heck, even they don't know why, but they've got to see it. Mayve it's for the fact of facing their fears and conquering whatever doubt is within themselves. They want to grow up, and they want to prove it.It's a great movie!"
4,Excellent,"This movie was a good coming of age film. I thought the characters were well developed and the train scene kicked!!! All of the background the characters had made it seem realistic. Even if it's rated R, I think everyone needs to see it. It's what real filmaking is all about. No sex, No drugs, No guns, just honest to goodness movie magic."
4,an amazing story,"Stephan king wrote a special story about childhood.You can feel the atmosphere of those days. Some parts are a little bit too long, but all in all it is an interesting story. The problem is that I can not sleep after this video anymore. I just have nightmares. The dead body of this story pursues me every night. His rotten hand is catching me and I am screaming the whole night. The worse thing is that I am now provided in a psychiatry - the good thing is that stephan king is enjoying me!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Adventure of a summer,"The time of the Sixtees is a great time for this story and the soundtrack is very great too. It's a nice summer adventure of four friends which would find the body.For me, some parts of the film are too long. But I think the story shows us that a true friendship will be the greatest gift we can get and that the childhood will be the best time in our whole life."
4,A good childhood time,"I mean that this movie is a good film to entertain all of the family. It is a light story with small hotspots all over the film. You can see well how the life was in the 1950s in American's back country. Affectionate Americana looking back at boyhood friendship and adventures in the 1950s. The story of a big adventures of 4 boys there began with a spin coin bet. I urge you to buy this movie, and you will be guaranteed to enjoy it. It is a truly touching movie."
5,Its a cool/sad awesome movie!,This movie was so awesome.It is kinda sad at the end but i think they all played a great role.I think that its a five star movie and its great for someone who likes movies of reality.
3,"I said ""f"" in the '50's !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I think that this movie is just to entertain people.I think that this film is worth watching. I would like to tell everybody that it isn't a movie witch want to show us anything useful, it's just entertaining. And I think that this film is better than the last few oscar-winners. I hope that you people won't take this film too personal because i don't want to see somebody vomiting all over his neighboors. I like this film, it's story is very funky and good disributed over the hole film. It's a shame that there arn't any love-scenes in this film I thought that there is a love-scene in each Hollywood-film... The Taff from ""la Suiza"""
1,ripoff - mono audio on this,"The Amazon description clearly alleges that this disk has 5.1 english audio. It's mono. Absolute, flat-out lie, which makes me think the review that claims 5.1 audio, is an Amazon ""plant""."
2,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"This is a film about four boys who go searching out for a dead body so they can become famous. I thought this movie had some pretty cool stuff in it, but the f word gets on your nerves after a while. Was the language in this film really necassary?"
3,A nice look back....,"(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)Those Extras:Commentary: Needed more. Reiner several times will disappear and important ground will not be covered. Stuff like locations or casting get overlooked and annoy. At least he nicely details the train bridge sequence.New Interviews: Terrific. Wheaton, Feldman, O' Connell, Reiner, Dreyfuss and even King hark back to the shooting. Oh to have gotten to hear Phoenix as well :(.Music Video: Though the late River is missed, it was immensely fun to watch him and Wheaton rock out with Ben E. King to the title tune. But where are Feldman and O' Connell?Overall: Good for a rental, cuz that's it, gang. This needs SO much more. A behind the scenes look, outtakes, deleted scenes, the trailer isn't even on the disc! The ""Karate Kid"" is instead!"
5,Classic,"Rob Reiner (the director) has done a beautiful job of capturing many things: an amazing era, adventure, serious-ness, and friendship. It is definitely a cult classic of the 1980's, and I highly suggest everyone watch it. All of the young actors come across so pure and wonderful - making it an easy watch, even though they are each battling their own wars with themselves, parents, and eachother at times.One of my all time favorite movies."
5,Audio-CD used - Ashra - The Virgin Years,The article reached me in the described condition (mint) with a nearly lightspeed shipping from the US to Germany ;). Thank you very much!
3,Loved this Watch Storage Box,"We almost didn't order this item due to a review we read regarding the space between the watch face and the glass lid being to small. I'm so glad we decided to chance it. We have not found this to be the case. My husband has been searching for a nice case to display his many watches in, but everthing has been more money than we were willing to spend. When we found this item it was in our budget and seemed to be just we were looking for. We love it! It's made wonderfully, and is beautiful as well. We couldn't be more pleased."
4,Wood finish not exactly as shown on the picture,"This is a fine watch box for the money. You have space for a dozen of your watches. The wood finish could be much glossier but you get what you paid for. Overall, it fits most of my collection except those extra large watches (i.e. Invicta Lupahs). Not a bad buy if you want to store most watches for less."
4,Great product!,This watch storage box is beautiful. Came the very next day! Would definitely order from Amazon again!
5,Classy,I bought this product for my husband and he loves it. He keeps asking me how much it was because it looks so expensive. Its definitely a good bank for your buck and it fits all his watches so nicely.
3,I'd be careful with this one....,"The product came in a timely manner and looks gorgeous BUT be careful, the drawers would barely open...they seem to be stuck or something. The top latch opens fine but the two drawers below take a lot of force to open. This was a gift for boyfriend who loves displaying his nice watches and he loves it and doesn't mind the fact that the bottom drawers are hard to open, but it bothered me (I am the one who bought it after all). Nice product other than that, but I probably would have bought a different watch box had I known."
3,Get What You Pay For!!!!,"This watch box is nice but as stated the bottom drawer will not hold the watches, not enough clearance. The pillows are not as pictured, they are small rectangular shape which allows the watches to move around. I really wish they had made the pillows to fit the square space as pictured to secure your watches from moving. Would have rated it four stars if pillows fit and five stars if bottom drawer was deeper."
3,JERKY BOYS SAMPLE!,Funky tune with an awesome jerky boys sample nicely placed. Worth getting if you like a)funky tunes or b) the jerky boys!
3,I don't get it.,"I dont get why Darkthrone is really so popular.I mean their newest CD wasnt horrible and had a refreshing punk twist to it, but mostly their songs consist of the same riffs over and over again. This CD is more like a snooze-fest that I've listened to once. I dont recommend this CD."
5,Great video,This video is a great breakdown of the art of Chin Na. The video tries to expand the art a little to far and in not sure how practical that would be in a real life situation. But if you know what chin na truly is than this video is a wonderful example.
4,Powerful,"I read Dave O'Neal's second book, ""The Pact With Bruno,"" first. Now I know why some reviewers are calling him the next Elmore Leonard. But you must read ""What Goes Around,"" to know what makes Doug Carlson tick. The night has eyes. And O'Neal's books would make great movies."
5,"A well-written, suspenseful novel.","Dave, you have an exciting little book. After getting started, I could not put it down. It is a well-written, suspenseful novel and should become a hit. It reads quite well on two different levels, as a fast paced thriller and a critical look at failed human systems."
5,Lisa from the North Shore,"What a beautiful story...This book was so touching I have started reading it to friends and family that come to visit my new baby. A book that touches each person in their own way. I could never have imagined a nicer way to explain to a child and of a lost loved one. The ""Angel with the Golden GLow"" is the most special story I have ever seen."
1,Not a greatest hits,"This CD should not be entitled ""Greatest Hits"". Some, if not all, of the songs on this CD are not the original recordings. This fact should have been made known to the buyer on the detail page."
5,Outstanding! And no problem with the re-makes.,"A previous reviewer made a comment about the (2) remakes that lead off this CD. While I too would have enjoyed the originals, hearing Jesse's new take on these classics is just fine with me. Darkness darkness in particular is sensational in it's new version. As for the rest of the album, since all my old vinyl is warped and scratched from over use, it's a real joy to hear Ridgetop or Songbird in all thier glory. It's been a long time. The liner notes were excellant, what a great idea! 5 Stars from me!"
3,Pineapple Thief starts with a bang and ends as a wimper.,"I don't know whats going on with some of these UK bands. They seem to start out with such promise and maybe greatness, then all of the sudden they become derivative and tired. This has happened to Radiohead and now Pineapple Thief. I am not saying they are a bad band but they haven't carved out anything new. They definetly are not a prog band. I really don't know who decided to tag them that. I feel they have become whiny and irritating and don't even rock like they did on the first two records."
2,Not what it looks like,"I thought this puzzle was shaped like the birds as it is shown, but when I opened it(and once you do you cannot return it) it was all outlined in white. All the outside pieces were white, so to me this does NOT look like I thought it would."
3,Well-done for a small Indie,"I thought the film was well-done for an inexpensively made Indie. Good story line; well written and the actors surprisingly good. The fact that it was shot near where I live and the fact that I know one of the producers may have colored my critique, but I think I would have given it a good rating nonetheless. Looking forward to their next production; which I understand is in the works."
4,absolutely smokin' a la EBM release,"As the title says. This is the best I have heard for years which carries the Original EBM (Electronic Body Music) style.. Hard-hitting. Absolutely exciting recording, but you gotta love this sort of music.. To the non-fan of intense music, it seems repetitive, but to us old-skool Industrial lovers.....Turn on the Mind-Drill, LIGHT IT UP....!"
4,"Might be more rock, but pretty awesome for an electro rock album...","I'm a big fan of their older work and saw them when they were touring last year. Their new work isn't as great as the old stuff, but I still think it is a very nice produced work. I am glad they tried doing something different, but didn't really lose much of their previous sound. It is more rock, and that is how they intended it to be. A bit more political too? Anyway, it took me a while to get into this album, but after a few listens I was set. My favorites are Reminders, Ruin (really cratchy inbetween rock and electro :)), Stand Up (probably the most catchy dancey track on this album, it was also their single), and Delete (this one's so hard, but it's good). It's really a well rounded album I think, go check it out!"
2,Couldn't stomach this one,What drew me to Stromkern was the electonics and the strings they used. This CD is more of a metal album. most of the songs all sounded the same to me. I gave it numerous tries but it just didn't click. I need electronic noodling in my music.
2,great idea - poorly executed,"What can you say about a guide which tells you about paradise but gives the wrong co-ordinates ?Unfortunately, despite its claims I now have to check all sources (locals to google earth) before going to a new pool with this book. I have spent hours on dirt roads, following the directions and finding out it is the wrong way.As my 10-year-old put it "" Maybe he doesn't want people to find these places"" !Another example is repeating the same map for two differant places !!"
1,flawed,"this book is riddled with flaws. the directions are misleading and dangerous. i have gotten lost on many of these excursions due to his poor trail descriptions. one will also be mislead by his money grubbing tactics. once you purchase the book you are lead to believe that you are allowed access to all of the holes in the book, but guess what? no. you have to join the serria club to get full access. lame, everyone knows the serria club is a cruel animal killing fratfest. i doubt this review will even stay up long enough to read because pancho is notorious for deleting these things the second they are written. i write this in the least slanderous way possible, but, he is in this for the money, not the love of swimmin. i recommend chris shaffer's book ""the definitive guide to waterfalls of southern and central california"" much better descriptions of waterfalls with swimmin holes with SAFE directions to and from."
4,Not sturdy at all but my daughter loves playing with it!,"I had read reviews that this wasn't sturdy and they sure were right! It took a long time to put together and it falls apart very easily. It needs to be put on a hard surface and can't really be moved at all or the tracks fall apart or the supports fall off. But with that said... my daughter loves it! She has been playing with is sooo much since Santa left it for her! My husband has had so much fun playing with it with her. The little shopping bag ""drop off"" is so cute and the escalator for the cars is really cool. Don't purchase if you don't have a lot of room. It is taking up a lot of space on our playroom floor and you can't move it since it's so unstable but it really is a lot of fun!"
4,My daughter LOVES this....,"Santa gave this to her last Christmas... was all set up.... and was by far, her favorite gift....It is not totally durable, and was a little crazy to set up, but for the price, it was totally worth the money...It is Nov following year, and she is still asking me to set it up to play with it...My daughter is not a total ""girly girl"", and loves to play with her big brother.... and this toy let her be a girl but still play with cars....I hope Santa brings something similar this Christmas!!"
4,"A fun, pink toy for a 3 years old girl",The granddaughter really loves this Christmas present. She has spent hours with it and the fact that it is pink makes it all the better.The only reason it wasn't rated the highest overall is because snapping the track together is somewhat difficult and one section didn't fasten securely until glue was applied.
5,Fun for ALL of them,"We got this toy for our 7 yr old daughter last Christmas. She has 3 brothers (one older and 2 younger). They ALL LOVE playing with this toy. The biggest problem is deciding to let them keep going around, or to let them cross the finish line and start over. This track is not any less durable than any other race track out there. And the fact that it is pink and motorized with lots of options for where to stop and what to do, keeps the kids entertained for a while. Sometimes they will make up their own design and others they just use the normal configuration. We highly recommend this toy to anyone looking for something ACTIVE for their little pink ones."
1,"Flimsy and poor assembly instructions, buy my niece loves it...","This thing is an exercise in frustration for my sister, who has to continually rebuild it. Now that my brother-in-law and I puzzled over the incomprehensible instructions for 4 hours on Christmas day... that's not too big a deal, but the first time, it was really awful. The factory sent this partially assembled, and one part was in backwards.... the instructions, mostly poorly drawn diagrams were no help. Because it was the ""it"" toy of the season, and my niece really loves it, we put up with it, but unless it is specifically requested by a child, I'd look elsewhere."
3,Pollywheels,This item it cool to play with and we like it but it falls apart easily.It is not very durable.
4,"Not well built, but SUPER FUN!!!","Despite the reviews, I bought this for my 5 yr. old daughter for Christmas. I got the mega set with 8 additional cars. She absolutely loves it!!!Worth mentioning, is that her 7 yr. old brother and 4 yr. old sister do too. True, it is not extrememly well built, but it was easy to assemble and works even without the few track supports which fall off. Well worth the $32 I spent for it."
3,Cute but flimsy,"This is an adorable concept, just wish it was made better. It works, but it will not stay together. When you bump it or try to move it, it falls apart! My daughter loves it when it is together!"
3,Race to the Mall (if it stays together),"Finally there is a racetrack for girls (even if it just takes them to the mall). My girls were excited to get this and did enjoy it once we set it up. It does take time to set it up and it doesn't stay together very well if it is at all moved. The buttons that launch them don't always work either, which was dissapointing."
2,Needs MAJOR improvements,"My daughter received this for Christmas and it looked like a cute concept. The problems started when we opened the box and realized the instructions (or lack of) was just a diagram where you had to figure out where to put the pieces. The track is very flimsy and the supports that come with it don't stay together.Once we got it together, my daughter had fun playing with it... but I had to keep putting tracks together and supports back in place because it kept coming apart as she played with it. She wasn't playing very rough with it, but it's just cheaply made.The little pieces are pretty much useless except for the little shopping bags that stick to the cars.It's a really cute concept but I wish they tracks were made alittle better!!"
1,"SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME, MONEY AND AGGREVATION!","I had read the negative reviews on this product but my daughter really wanted it for Christmas, so I bought it. I figured, like all Polly stuff, a little super glue would help keep it together and she could enjoy it. WRONG. We returned it the day after Christmas. All Polly stuff is flimsy and poorly made, but this is the worst of the evils. The buttons to launch the cars didn't even work. Save yourself the time and energy, and your child the frustration and DON'T BUY THIS TOY! Mattel should be ashamed!"
4,muy bueno pero muy fragil,"Tengo morochos, un niño y una niña, acaban de recibir este juguete para navidad, y a ellos les encanto. El unico problema es que el juguete es muy fragil. Pero los entretiene mucho. Pena que solo lo fabriquen para nuñas, pero eso no impide que mi niño juegue con el. LES ENCANTA"
1,Very poor engineering - flimsy - too many parts - instructions poor,"Yet another poorly designed toy. Extremely flimsy, pieces fit together very poorly causing car to stop mid-track or fail to pass through various gates and openings. Assembly instructions had numerous errors (both pictures and instructions). Pre-assembled parts work very poorly."
2,Waste of time and money,"Just another reason to try to get my daughter not to play with Polly and her friends. The track takes for too long to put together, comes apart very easily, far too many parts for a simple track. Mall feature is within the tracks and unaccessable for any play. Overall design looks great, but not fun for her to play alone or with friends.It falls apart with the slightest movement and what child does not try to move their toys? Only value was in the cars, she likes them and would love to be able to buy more than the 2 that come with the track. She plays with the cars with her doll house and actually asked me to put the racetrack back in the box."
2,"Chinsy construction, lots of work for adults, fun for kids","Can't believe this cheap toy has become so expensive. My girls liked the idea of it, but the connectors were weak, so the track often fell apart mid-use. The motor that drove the ""car escalator"" was fairly loud, and talk about sexist - but that's another matter entirely.That said, we gave it away last year to another little girl who was thrilled to have it. And believe it or not, I kind of miss this toy - and putting it together time and time again."
1,Do NOT waste your money on this one!,"We bought this for our daughters, ages 4 and 6. They were SO excited about it (having seen the commercials of course) and they seem to like it but we (Mom and Dad) hate it.The pieces are flimsy, especially the track supports. Even the slightest bump will have the track pieces separating and the supports falling off. The escalator feature is fun for the most part, but again, if the set up is bumped it dislodges the drive mechanism and the escalator won't go.Needless to say, either Mom or Dad has to be nearby to re-set the pieces every two minutes.The teeny accessories are useless and the girls haven't even attempted to play with them.This toy is very cheaply made, and a big disappointment from a major toy manufacturer such as Mattel. It might be on your little girl's wishlist, but I'd steer clear of this one if I were you!"
1,Total GARBAGE!!!,"This toy is a piece of garbage.Cheap isn't the word to describe it. It took my husband an hour to put it together, and the slightest movement makes the whole thing fall apart. You can't even turn it or the tracks separate and the pieces come crumbling down. My daughter (5 years) asked if she could play with it in the living room - so I tried to very carefully carry it - it was like starting over again.Honestly, I was not expecting a really high quality toy here, but it is horrible. I am considering throwing it in the box and sending it to Mattell.The ""race"" idea gets old after about 10 minutes and she just played with the Polly Pocket girls on her bed after that. So save your money and save yourself some aggrevation and just buy a little playset and some pink hotwheels.Ugh!"
1,FALL APART TERRIBLE TOY DO NOT BUY,"THIS POLLY POCKET TRACK IS A WASTE OF MONEY. IT IS FLIMSY. THE SUPPORTS DO NOT SUPPORT THE TRACKS, THEY ARE NOT STURDY ENOUGH. NOT EVEN ON A HARD SURFACE. THE TRACKS DO NOT STAY TOGETHER. THE FORCE USED TO PUSH DOWN THE BUTTON TO SHOOT THE CARS MAKES THE ENTIRE TRACK MOVE THUS BREAK. THAT BUTTON BROKE AFTER TWO TIMES. GENTLE USE TOO. WHEN BUYING THE CARS SEPARATE BE SURE THEY HAVE A HOOK ON THE BOTTOM AS NON OF THE SINGLE ONES WE BOUGHT DID SO THEY WERE NOT NOT NOT COMPATIBLE. THIS SET IS IN THE GARBAGE."
3,"Nice idea, not worth the money","What a great idea, right? Girls love race tracks just as much as boys (I always wanted one!), and this one is PINK. But it is complicated to assemble (my 9 yo can't even begin), and constantly falls apart. Santa brought this for Christmas last year, and the girls did play with it...until it fell apart. Since then it has lied in many, many pieces in a bag in a closet. The girls aren't interested because it keeps falling apart, and I simply don't have time to keep digging out the instructions and putting it back together. It was a waste of money."
2,Not Very durable,"This product is cute, and my daughter has fun with it, BUT it falls apart VERY easily!!!! Right now it's sitting in the middle of her toy room because if you try to move it, it just falls apart!! The pieces just do not want to stay together!! If I had to do it again, I would NOT purchase this product!!"
2,Race to the Mall,"I was very disappointed in the Polly Pocket Race to the Mall Toy. It will not stay together and the item to release the cars jams all the time, so my six year can't play with it."
5,The best Garfield book ever,I think this is the best Garfield book because it has the 20 best cartoons and other stuff
5,I laughed for a long time!,"Not only is Garfield one of the greatest characters in comics history, he's also the funniest. Jim Davis takes us through 20 years of your favourite Orange feline. Some parts of the book just make ya laugh forever and it's hard to put it down. I'd recommend this book to any comics fan or anyone who likes to laugh."
3,NEEDS TO BE RENAMES,I love my printer but they need to change the name of the ink cartridge from CLI-36 to CLI-30 because 30 prints is all I got out of it. Thats too expensive in my opinion. Over $.50 per 4x6 picture.
1,Very Expensive,"There is no question why printers are so cheap - it's ink, they make the money on. Number 36 did 6 prints at best and cost about $20.00."
2,Changing Frequencies,"A thoroughly inbetween album, ""Obscure Alternatives"" shows the transition the band was making from its trash-rock roots (see ""Adolescent Sex"") to its haute couture future (see ""Quiet Life"")and doesn't succeed at being anywhere near as good as either. The ersatz soul-funk that made the first album such a guilty pleasure has been replaced by steely rock guitars (""Automatic Gun"") and voyeuristic, off-kilter pop that ineffectively steals from new wave (""Love is Infectious""), Bowie (""Suburban Berlin"") and even reggae! (""...Rhodesia"") As usual, the musicianship and arrangements are superb but this is the sound of an unhappy and unsure band. The final track takes a slow piano coda from Erik Satie (something which would happen on the the next two albums to far better effect) and points the band to its future, but it doesn't rescue the overall collection from sounding forced and pouty. An obscure alternative indeed."
2,a REload of Alternative,"Metallica has been a favorite band of mine since I bought the Black Album. But when I bought this, I was disappointed except for ""The Memory Remains"", the only good song on the CD. All the rest of it just doesn't sound original. I also don't like the fact that they got their haircut like the Backstreet Boys. They should have kept their hair long, kept thrashing like they did 15 years ago and not made this album such a disappointment."
3,respectable but passed peak,"This album is ok but it is obvious that metallica i spast its createive peak with this album. The songs seem to just drag on like the memory remains or devil's dance. Unforgiven2 is pretty food but why keep the intro from the original Unforgiven? They albums that they have done since this album continue to prove metallica has run out of ideas. Garange inc, an album of covers. S&M, has just two new songs, one of which they have been working on for years. The others are just stuff from previous albums. So far, there is no info about a metallica album with all new material on it. Lars says that 2000 is an off year for metallica so don't go holding your breath for it."
2,"Oh, for the good old days.","As a stand-alone album this is competent enough stuff. But comparisons to pre-Load era Metallica will leave the more established fan a bit disheartened. Goodbye sweet riffage, you will be missed. Thank God Iron Maiden is back, maybe James and the boys will get inspired again by their New Wave of British Heavy Metal heros."
3,CANT BELIEVE METALLICA MADE THIS,"Seriously,this album can't hold a candle to any other of Metallica's works,except for Load.Fuel is pretty good and I thought maybe Metallica gave up the Load approach to songs,but the rest of the album is pretty much crap.Unforgiven II was always bound to be compared to its prequel,hence making it was a stupid move.It's okay,in fact,but the solo is seriously terrible.I don't want to believe that this was GUITAR GOD Kirk Hammett playing those solos,because they are not worthy of his name.They tend to fizzle out about a millisecond after they start and instead of pumping you up they make you want them to get over.Not what I call vintage Metallica.'Where...things are' is sufficiently creepy but there is not much substance in there.In conclusion,I think this is a must buy for any fan who has heard the first four albums since this sorry effort will make you appreciate them much more."
2,Psh.....,"I still remember that, after the release of this album, I had the sneaking suspiscion that Metallica had run out of steam (thank God Garage Inc. and S&M; delayed those thoughts). I liked ""Fuel"", ""The Unforgiven II"", and ""Fixxxer"", but the rest are throwaways in my eyes. I mean, what the hell was up with the retarted moaning at the end of ""The Memory Remains""? It would've been a halfway-decent song without it; the S&M; version definitely kills the one here.I can't really recommend this to anyone besides the diehard fans."
1,The only thing I miss about the 80's is Metallica,"In my opinion, its not about how heavy you are, or how fast and in perfect timing you keep with your bandmates, its about the reason you are doing it all for. Why your putting the thing together in the first place. I purchased this album with the intention of giving Metallica another chance after skipping several of their current releases. That said, it is obvious what this album is about. Commercial success (excuse me while I gag). What was Metallica initially about? Why were they so great throughout the 80s? Because it was being done for the kids. Money changes people, even the best people. Nothing rings truer with this band. And that said, I pose this question to you Jaymz, what about the kidz? Money and fame are a shallow substitute for perhaps the most important reason of all for playing in the first place: being a kid and sharing your greatness with other kidz. Just my opinion."
3,There descent into........,"This album had some good songs on it, and although some people say that the black album was the last good album, I think that this album is pretty good. Worth buying, but it definatly forshadowed there descent into whatever you want to call St Anger. Theres some good songs but some of them just suck. I like unforgiven 2, fuel, and fixxxer. Some others are good too but these are my 3 favorites. One song that failed horribly is Where the Wild things Are, what were they trying to do? I myself don't know, but if i were you this would be the last metallica album to buy."
4,METALLICA ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Songs like ""Fuel"" ""The Unforgiven II"" ""The Memory Remains"" and ""Slither"" makes this the best head banging Metallica CD yet. For all you metal fans this is the stuff!!"
5,Metallica is becoming better every year!.,I think that Metallica has developed a lot since their first album.Many people are now very disappointed about their music.They say that their music has been influenced too much by commercial interests since The Black Album. It is true that there is a big diffrence between the music of Kill Em All and Reload.But I see that as something natural.Because they are growing older their music is becoming mature too.But I would not say that their music is becoming soft!. They still are and will forever be the KINGS OF HEAVY METAL!!!!!!!!!!!!.
3,A mixture of greatness and mediocrity,"There are four highlights to this album:1. Fuel2. The Memory Remains3. Unforgiven II4. Low Man's LyricThe rest is nothing to write home about, some tracks one might even consider skipping when listening to this CD."
2,Mixed,"...Load I thought was the worst CD of all Metallica CDs.Reload, in my opinion, is probably the 2nd worst Metallica CD. The reason I'm thinking so negatively here is because I expected Metallica to be a little bit more metal sounding; I was really expecting more drive.Fuel is good and one song, Memory Remains, is really cool.What I really didn't like about this CD is that the instruments sound too tight and commercial; It really does sound like they didn't use amps on this CD! It sounds like they used some POD like devices. I swear I heard keyboards too ... it's really disappointing -because they really are a popular heavy metal band- if you know what I'm talking about..."
2,Wretched,"Yeah, it's pretty much useless at this point to submit my opinion on the subject, but after listening to Master of Puppets for the first time in a lengthy while, I am oh so sadly reminded of how much I'm bothered by the extent to which these 90s Metallica albums have soured my opinion of this once great band."
4,Still Metallica,"It hurts to give a Metallica album a 4. But this album is still good. ""Fuel""-""Unforgiven 2"" are excellent songs. But things start to get bad from ""Better than you"" to ""Where the Wild Things Are"". But then comes ""Prince Charming"" which is a pretty good song. But ""Low Man's Lyric"" has got to be one of the greatest slow Metallica songs, and has powerful lyrics. ""Attitude"" and ""Fixxxer"" are both great speed metal songs. With the exception of a few fillers this is a great album."
1,Metallica's dead,"I feel Metallica is the greatest example of a sellout that there ever has been. They didn't evolve as much as they devolved after Master of Puppets. They aren't even metal anymore, they are just bluesy soft rock. If you want to hear some good heavy metal, listen to the first 3 Metallica albums or Led Zepplin, because they are the best example of a band that evolved without selling out or making crappy music."
1,RELOAD OF GARBAGE!!!,This album is just as bad if not worst than load because it sounds completely the same.No memorable songs and all the lyrics are extremely cheesy.How could the same band which created the masterpiece album master of puppets create this filth?This band has completely sold out and have become lazy because they probably think they have nothing left to prove.They are touring with a bunch of numetal bands and it wouldnt surprise me if they got eminem to play with them.Yes people it is literally getting that bad now adays.All they care about is money now and being on mtv.DO NOT BUY THIS OR SUPPORT THEM ANYMORE!!!
1,The final nail in the coffin,"I have always loved Metallica, but everything that has a beginning has an end. This was it. The end of the Metallica era. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Really good country album..,"hahahaha...Well, if i had to choose between Load and Re-load, i'll probably go with Load. Re-load has a great start with ""Fuel"", and Devil's Dance is also very good. But Re-load is a strange album, even more strange than Load, which i think was close enough to the metal genre anyway."
2,"Take 1 cup of Load, Add 10 cups of Worse and Stir...","Load was a scuff on the Metallica logo. Reload is a stain. Many claim that the album features good songwriting and originality and that if Metallica kept producing thrash albums they would get repetitive. This album is repetitive not only in and of itself(Reload, as in Load again), but features little diversion from mediocrity among its own songs. The only stand out song is the riling The Unforgiven II. Working off a theme from the Black album, a powerful and original song is composed that's surprisingly effective. The rest of the album is stale. Fuel is much weaker than it first appears and The Memory Remains, while creepy, isn't technical nor is it well-written. I liked Low Man's Lyric, but it isn't Metallica. If you look at this album as though it was released by another band, it shines a little, but like Load, reality tarnishes it heavily. Don't buy."
5,ReLoad is good... in a different way,"Being a hardcore Metallica fan, I would say just about anything they do is good. Personally, I like the slowed down versions just as much. I feel these are almost better because they have a more hidden motive behind each song which is really cool. The Unforgiven 2 is an awesome song as well... The whole CD is worth that song, even though most of the songs, like all Metallica cds, are good."
1,AMAZING,"The transformation that surrounded James, Kirk, Lars and Newsted is something really amazing, something to be studied by scholars !! How a band changes direction so hardly and begin to being so commercial, is almost unbeliavable. I have nothing against trying new approaches, but Metallica later albuns are so heartless, formulatic, Kirk Hammett is playing his worst ever, Lars drums seems a machine, so boring it is. As for James, he still can write some of the best riffs around, but I think he's guarding them somewhere .... FORGET ABOUT METALLICA."
5,That is why I like Metallica !,"I don't care what old fans are saying, but there are lots of us, who think that Fuel,The Memory Remains,The Unforgiven II and Low Man's Lyric are the best Metallica songs ever. And yes, we buy, not Napster it."
3,A Step Back,"As a fan of ""Load,"" I was hoping Metallica would deliver more great music when they ""Re-Load""ed with this album. But after really giving it a chance, most of the songs on Load fall into one of 2 categories. 1) Radio-friendly rock & 2) Filler material. It's obvious that a lot of these songs were the ""Load"" leftovers (Bad Seed, Carpe Diem Baby, Devil's Dance). The 3 mainstream songs contained here are not particularly good either - they're not bad, but Metallica have done MUCH better. The albums saving grace are the closing 3 songs (Attitude, Low Man's Lyric, & Fixxxer). The 3 closing songs have the classic Metallica formula going for them whether it be fast or slow.But in the end, ReLoad seems to be a more riff-oriented album than Load, but this doesn't necessarily make it any better, let alone even on the same page (there isn't one song with that special sound to it).Jab Another Pin In Me..."
4,Reload is worth buying!,"Reload from Metallica is a rock/h. metal CD which is almost THE BEST. Some tracks (Fixxxer), [The Unforgiven II(The I is better)], (Low man's lyric) are worth listening to. If anybody listens to rock or heavy metal should buy this cd."
1,after the black album tallica r not tallica,"when the black album had hit the shelfs back in 91 all the real cool heavy metal fans were shocked that their can be a change to the best , but when follow up to the best selling album came load was not just a shock it was a shock that the tallica fan never could overcome to all of ya tallica fans this is the only thing i could ask of ya cause if ur just getting n2 metal thats a bliss cause u never went through the hell that was called the mid 90s - skip load and reload and go straight to the garage cds"
4,Reloaded Indeed,"On the companion album to Load, Metallica stretches further out into what can only be described as ""biker rock territory."" This album has more agression than its bluesier counterpart and is definitely a better representation of the band. ""Fuel"" is super charged boogie and ""The Memory Remains"" sounds like muscled up Sabbath. ""Don't go lookin' for snakes, you might find them,"" James Hetfield warns on the swaggering ""Slither."" Hetfield's vocals are improved, as are Kirk Hammett's bluesy fills. There are a million cool riffs on this album. I just wonder why they remade ""Unforgiven,"" into a flaccid country tune ""Unforgiven 2."" Oh well."
2,Alternica Part Deux,"Although slightly better than Load (of...) it still lacks killer riffs, and speed, which is good, if you like The Cranberries. Not recommended if you like ""Puppets"" or ""Justice""."
3,It's Aiight,"I have two ways of looking at this album:One on hand, this is VERY beneath Metallica; the fast and furious hijinks that got me listening to them(a black guy that loves hip hop) 10 years ago are long gone. Thanks to them, I no longer associated heavy metal with [bad] pop bands like Poison and Bon Jovi and got into Anthrax, Cannibal Corpse, Megadeth and other super heavy bands. This Metallica died with Cliff Burton 17 years ago, even though I liked And Justice For All; which leads me to part two of this conversation:This is not a BAD album! There are some bright spots on this album, including Fuel, The Memory Remains,Devils Dance and The Unforgiven II,but for the most part this not worth investing your hard earned paper in. Hopefully their next project will have let them see the light and come on home!"
3,"Not bad, not great","Reload has its moments, although I think it is unfair to compare it to previous albums. By itself, Reload is a good rock-and-roll album with highs and lows. I don't consider Reload a metal album because most of the songs could be played on the radio and are relatively short. The highs are on such songs as ""The Memory Remains"", ""Fixxxer"", and ""Unforgiven II"" with interesting guitar work and lyrics. The lows (unfortunately more of these) are on songs like ""Slither"", ""Prince Charming"", and ""Bad Seed"". These songs are repetitive, unimaginative, and for the first time in my Metallica listening career...annoying. This album is Metallica's most commercial by far. All artists have a right to express themselves through their medium however they choose, but for the sake of Metallifans everywhere I hope the next album has heavier riffs, perhaps an insturmental, and some guitar solos!!!"
1,"Sad, sad, sad, sad, sad.......","If you compare it to all the garbage that is always being played on the radio or eMpTyV, this album is not that bad. But if you compare it to the work that this band did in the 80's, this is absolute trash!!! Long gone are the days in which MetallicA was one of the top 5 music acts in the world. It's very, very sad... :("
1,Sellouts of the Century,"I cannot say enough about how Metallica has done a 180 turn for the worst. They were everything that metal meant; after all, they were metal'lica. But since they started selling records and got a taste for dead presidents they have lost their integrity. I mean this in the truest sense of the word. With their impending lawsuit against napster, this band has layed the last brick in the wall between them and their fans. Lars says that the band doesn't like their art traded like a commodity. What does that mean, Lars. We aren't talking about a group of starving artists here. Additionally, music being sold by the record companies doesn't qualify as ""traded like a commodity""? Oh the days when Burton was playing with the band. They were masters of the trade. He must be turning over in his grave now..."
4,What is wrong with all of you?,"Come on, this is an obvious ""step down"" for Metallica, but you cant ignore the fact that its still good music. I like reload better than lod, dont know why, I just do. It may not be ""pure Metallica,"" but still, its good music. Also, this is the 3rd most tallented band in HISTORY, they dont make bad music(1.Led Zeppelin and 2.Rush). Someone said they were as good as Silverchair, FEH! Metallica WILL live on forever, weather you like it or not, sorry to say, Silverchair wont make it past the millenium. And to those of you that think bands like Nirvana and Silverchair are MORE TALLENTED than Metallica, Wake up morons, stop being so damn ignorant."
5,BEAUTIFUL! ITS A SURE 5 STAR,"How can someone live without it? The first time i heard Re Load, my heart when AAAAA, HELL YEAH!!!!!!GO METALLICA AND GO AMAZON!I DEDICATE THIS TO EVERYONE AT U.C.S. AND KATTI!!"
5,"Oh, YES!","Snake, I am a snake. Tempting, that bite you take. Take a real BIG bite of this cake! Buy, buy, buy!"
3,"Not as good as ""Load""...","If ""Reload"" is supposed to be a continuation of ""Load"", somehow it doesn't live up to its predecessor. ""Load"" was somewhat more adventurous whereas ""Reload"" sounds the same more or less. The best tracks are ""The Memory Remains"", ""The Unforgiven II"", ""Better Than You"", ""Prince Charming"", ""Low Man's Lyric"", and of course ""Fuel"". The rest of the other tracks are more or less filler. Still, ""Reload"" is worth a listen whether or not Metallica has sold out (which I could care less...)."
4,metallica is still doing it and going strong!,"I got into Metallica when i first heard UnforgivenII. After that i went on to listen to Reload, which completely rocks, as well as all of their old stuff. Kirk is way awsome on the guitar and Lars rules on the drums. Reload is livelyer and somewhat different but always good."
4,More like Metallica at last!,"After the complete disaster of the album named 'Load' , ReLoad gives us fans better music. Although not (again) like the old Metallica, the sound of this album is quite good. 'Menory Remains' and 'The Unforgiven II' are candidates of classical Hard Rock pieces. Well, all in all, Metallica does it if they want!"
3,Decent album (3.5 Stars),"This album really isn't as bad as many people say. But a few songs were either not that good or too long, to i had to take away some stars. Here's a track-by-track analysis:1. Fuel-10/10-A good way to start an album. It's miles ahead of Load's starter, Ain't My B****.2. Memory Remains-10/10-Also a good song.3. Devil's Dance-10/10-I love the bass in this song.4. Unforgiven II-10/10-Not a bad rendition5. Better Than You-6/10-Repetitive, crappy lyrics.6. Slither-7/10-WTF? THIS is a bad rendition of Enter Sandman!!!7. Carpe Diem Baby-7/10-OK song8. Bad Seed-8/10-Good song.9. Where the Wild Things Are-10/10-FINALLY! Another 10/10 song!10. Prince Charming-7/10-11. Low Man's Lyric-7/10-WTF? Metallica doing soft rock? It's not really that bad a song though.12. Attitude-5/10-I ussuaLLY SKIP THIS SONG.13. Fixxxer-20/10-awesome! This would be a 5 star album if every song were as good as this!Bootm line: It's actually a good album."
4,Metallica Blues,"Hey, I have to say, that isn't the real Metallica. This is Blues Rock. At least, Reload is good, but not their best. I think their best album is ""Kill 'Em All"" or the super-duper ""Master Of Puppets"". Blues fans, this cd is for you. Metal fans, keep away from that cd.Metallica Best Albums: 1) Master Of Puppets 2) Kill 'Em All 3) The Black Album 4) And Justice For All 5) Reloadbye!"
2,What the hell is this?,"This album seemed to be forced. It just wasn't them. They made songs like ""One"", ""Fight fire w/ fire"" and ""Battery"", then they make this poor excuse for a heavy metal album. By the way, I DO NOT CARE THAT THEY CHANGED THIER LOOKS! Just because a person gets thier hair cut and blah blah blah, doesn't mean a damn thing to me. Load was a good album, this is the weakest metal album I have ever heard."
1,"The songs that weren't good enough for ""Load""","This album contains the songs that weren't considered good enough to be included on ""Load"". Whereas there were a couple of songs on ""Load"" that I thought were okay, I didn't like a single one of these.If you're new to Metallica, I recommend ""Master Of Puppets"" or ""Ride The Lightning"".I have to add though: does anyone else find it ironic that a band that supposedly hates being labeled chose to name themselves METALlica?"
1,Don't get me started,"Ever had that feeling when you really like a band so much, you'll get the new album when it comes out and you're trying really hard to like it, making yourself think you do, but you wonder why it's so hard? That's exactly how I felt about Reload when I was 16. Young and stupid. Times change, and so do people, so if the late 90s were characterized by nu metal and alternative rock, that was your bait for corporate opportunities. Only after 3-4 years of obnoxious overplayed preppy alternative songs on the radio, especially off of this album, I decided to give up on Metallica and traded in all my CDs at the used record store. I still like to thrash all around and act like a maniac every once in a while, but I also appreciate some artistic value in music."
1,This is worse than Load!!Too bad I had to give it a star!!!!,This is an alternitive album. Where are the blistering riffs? Where are the thundering chords? Where has the Heavy Metal gone??? This was such a waste of my money!! When I think of the other CD's I could've bought it makes me cry!!!
1,This release is a joke!,"What happened to the days when you could listen to a Metallica cd over and over and it sounded as fresh the first time as the last i.e. Ride the Lightning, Master. This release is as week as Load! Metallica is rakin in on the profits from you and I the fans that are taking chances on garbage like this.Megadeth is where its at!"
1,Face-It Alternica is not Metallica,"Ok some angry fans dash the new Metallica for not being ""as heavy"" but this is not the *real* reason we are so pissed off. The reason is that there is no musical value in the new music. Old hits like ""Fade to Black"" and ""Sanatarium"" were slow and on the softer side but didn't smell of trite pop garbage. Face it... although the Justice and Black album were *decent* I am still of the opinion that Metallica just isn't talented enough to write good songs without their cornerstone CLIFF BURTON. Metallica died with this man-- May Metallica and Cliff Rest in Peace and may God smite these imposters!"
1,A big disappointment,"I listened to it once and thought that it was garbage. I thought to myself, ""Well, maybe that's not fair. Perhaps I should listen a few more times before passing such a harsh judgement."" So I listened a couple more times and decided that my first impression was spot on. The CD is not worth the money that I spent on it."
1,"If I could give this album ZERO stars, I would","Metallica has become a dim shadow of their former self. Yes, yes, I've heard all of the talk about musical maturity, however, Metallica has lost any edge they once had. Honestly, I doubt they'll ever regain it. Unforgiven 2 may be the saddest blow of all, revisiting and revising a truly great track, and turning it into something that the Metallica of old would have snubbed from b-side status. Hetfield has gone the way of the almighty dollar, and the only unforgiven sin is this last and worthless album."
1,Half-hearted.,"The problem with this album is that it meanders from first to last track without doing much. ""Fuel"" is hardly the heavy headbanger the unschooled in metal make it out to be. The main riff is 2 notes, and James sounds uninspired. I find that people still call Metallica a ""heavy metal"" band is laughable. These are the same people who can't stand bands like Iced Earth or Blind Guardian, who are leading the new wave of metal, because they're ""too heavy."" Heavy metal should blow you away. No matter how loud I turn up this album, it still doesn't blow me away."
1,What's the deal Metallica?,"I've been listening to thrash and speed metal for a long time now and this is Metallica's worst album. It's as if they took all their old fans, told them to get lost, and got alternative fans! I tried to listen to it with an open mind but it still sucks no matter what. James Hetfield lost his growl and some of the guitar riffs sound like country! What's more, Kirk Hamett's guitar solos are horrible! Metallica really lost their touch with this one. I doubt they will ever be able to put out a good album again. If you really liked Lightning, Puppets etc., I doubt you will like this album."
1,I dont know what you positive folks are talking about,"This album is not only a let down for Metallica fans, its a let down for music in general. I have been a Metallica for many many years and this is obviously the worst, even worse than Load, which at least had a couple decent tunes. Its a bad album by music standards as well, I put it right up there with Gruntruck's wreck of a first album. The album is unlistenable too. St. Anger is ok, at least they are raw and aggressive like the old days in the music. Reload is just plain Horrible."
4,"Kinda disappointing, but better than Load","Okay, I have one message: It's not as bad as everyone tells it...I admit it is disappointing to some point-but not as disappointing as Load, which is the worst album next to Garage, Inc. Clearly, I think TRUE Metallica fans have been sold out. They almost make me sick now, because of the stuff they've shown now...and yes I have been a fan since the day they started. And their best album is ...And Justice For All-no matter if the sound is shoddy or not, it has all the songs on it. Master Of Puppets will also go down in history too. Ride the Lightning and Kill Em All are REALLY good, also...but I really think Metallica has really sold us TRUE fans out...peace"
4,More syrup for your pancakes?,This record is probably the strangest of all Metallica. The first 4 tracks are the best. Low Man's Lyric is a nice branch off the Metal tree and Fixxxer has a nice fat sound. The rest I can live without. Certainly not their best or even close but it IS another page in the life of Metallica. Metal Forever!
3,It's could of been better.,I am a fan of Metallica but this one was just not that good.There were only a few good songs but those song were pretty good.But over all don't waste your time or money on this CD.Trust me buy one of there other ones.
4,Why did Metallica cut their hair and change the music pace?`,IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY THEY CUT THEIR HAIR! The bottom line is that Metallica has successfully evolved into a band that will no doubt take their place in music history.
3,"I am a huge fan of metallica, other than this album","This album does not compare to their first four, but it has Fuel, Unforgiven 2, Low Man's Lyric, and Fixxer. Other than those 4 songs, the rest are all of Metallica's worst songs. I gave Load 4 stars because that album is still awesome, even though it is slower than traditional Metallica ( The Outlaw Torn kicks @$$). This album has only 4 goods songs though, and is by far Metallica's worst album."
2,Buy Something Else,"This album has let me down and Metallica are bastards. Do not buy this CD!!!! I know that this may not get posted as it breaks the rules but DON'T LET FUEL TRICK YOU!!!! The album opens up with Fuel and that IS a good song, one of the best metal songs that I have ever heard. But the rest? They're not brilliant. Prince Charming tends to grow on you a bit, as do most of the songs, but if your compare this to something like Nevermind by Nirvana, Bone To Pick by the Gone Jackals, Live After Death by Iron Maiden, or indeed, all the other Metallica albums, you'll be sorely disappointed. Get one the other albums I mentioned. Now? Well, now I'm off to buy Metallica (oddly enough, by Metallica) and take Re-Load back. Just see if you can get an MP3 of Fuel or something, as that song IS good."
3,Re-Load,"Well Once again Metallica comes back with another albulm. Many people thought that after Load they shoud have packed it in. There are a few good trackx on this abulm but to compare it to previous Meatllica albulms such as Ride The Lightning, And Justice For All..., and Master of Puppets is a crime. This is a good albulm but in my opinion is not really the typical Metallica sound. The best track on this albulm is a slower less reconized track about a man in a deep depression, Low Mans Lyric, it tells about how hes eventually going to get what he deserves and all kinds of stuff like that. The more reconizable songs on this ablulm are... Fuel, The Memory Remains, and the reminder that Metallica has been and always will be a force, the unforgiven 2. A good albulm to pull out occationally."
4,"Improvement over Load, but some low points.","This album had some good tunes, like Fuel, but unfortunately there were a couple of songs that were a little too long and a little too boring. This was the first Metallica CD I bought, but now I very rarely listen to it because I've got Puppets and AJFA, not to mention the black album. As far as Megadeth goes, nobody with an ounce of intelligence should listen to those wannabes over Metallica. Metallica set the standard for metal, and bands like Megadeth and Pantera were merely followers. BTW, Dave Mustaine doesn't hold a candle to Kirk Hammett."
1,BLEEEEECH! SOMEBODY KILL ME NOW!!!!!,"THREE WORDS DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM ""STINK, STANK, STUNK""! GET THE F$#@ OUTTA HERE. THIS AIN'T METALLICA, THIS IS POPROCKICA. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY WHEN EVERYONE KNEW WHO THEY WERE. I MISS THE GOOD OL' DAYS WHEN I COULD MOSH AROUND MY ROOM AND AIR GUITAR TO THEIR SONGS, BUT NO MORE, NOW I HANG MY HEAD IN SHAME AND BASK IN THE OLD ALBUMS OF YESTERYEAR AND ASK MYSELF, ""WHAT, DID I MISS SOMETHING HERE?"" STICK A FORK IN 'EM THEIR OVERDONE! SEE YA!"
1,I wish you could give negative ratings,"Oh boy, here we go again. This album is marginally better than Load, and really stinks to high heaven if your a fan of their real music, but, like most other real fans, it doesn't stop us from buying the albums. I'm sick and tired of this ****, the past 3 albums have been nothing but commercialized, self-serving... I guess buying each new album thinking maybe it will kick *** again is stupid, actually i know its stupid after listening to this. When I first listened to this with my friends, we laughed at most of the lyrics. There's no emotion, no speed, and worst of all, not a drop of metal in this entire album. I think I could walk up to James and smack him, and he'd play a country riff and sing ""yeah, yeah!"" instead of fighting back. This band is very close to losing a real fan. Luckily, the old **** still kicks ***."
1,And now they will suck forever!!!!!!,"This is the worst album that I will not listen in my life! This guys should change the bands name to ""Sissylica"". In case you don't know, Metallica's last album as a band was ""..and justice for all"". After that they opted to make money out of all you new fans that really know what good music sounds like...."
1,how pretentious can one band be?,"Wow! With phrases like ""Be not afraid"" it's no wonder this album sucks. Ok, ""Fuel"" what the hell is this song, all it does is describe how fuel works in an engine, HOW IS THIS A SONG??? ""The Memory Remains"" this is a song about NOTHING, they just took a bunch of words that rhymed that mean nothing together. ""Unfogiven II""? WHAT?!?!?!? a sequil to a freakin' song? this just proves metallica is using the success of previous songs to their moneymaking advantage. ""Better than you"" no, I don't think so, I still haven't sold out. If you agree with me try some good bands like Samael, Black Sababth, Pantera, Fear Factory, Type O Negative etc."
3,Definetely better than Load,"Not a buy, but the four songs that I heard, ""Fuel"", ""The Memory Remains"", ""Prince Charming"", and ""Better Than You"", certainly showed vast improvements over the disposable Load from the previous year."
3,"It's not a BAD album, it's actually pretty good","This isnt metallicas best, but its still pretty good.I dont get why people say this album sucks, because it does NOT suck.Sure its no master of puppets, but it deserves some credit.The best song on this album is probably fuel, or the memory remains.The unforgiven II is pretty good too.I just wish there was country guitar riffs on this album.I'll tell ya one thing, its a hell of a lot better than st. anger!Anyway, all in all, i'd say this is a pretty decent album,just not their best.Really listen to it, and you'll see what I mean.Not as good as load,but good."
2,Ugh terrible!,Metallica has not made a good album since And Justice For All. Even the Black Album has a few forgettable songs and those are becoming more and more prominent in each subsequent album. Master of Puppets is my benchmark and they have fallen far from that peak. Load is just that.
3,nothing special,"we were all afraid metallica lost it with this album. It doesn't have the bite that any of their previous releases had (although it does have one of my favorite songs ever: the unforgiven II). while some of the laid back style is very good (such as in unforgiven II) others just leave you feeling cheated (such as low man's lyric). This does have some other good songs, though, like fuel, memory remains, and fixxxer. not that impressive, but not necessarily bad."
2,Still not the very worst of metallica but pretty darn close,"Let me just say this album is on the very edge of not worth having. King Nothing is about the only descent song on here. Unforgiven 2 is junk in comparison to the great song unforgiven was on their Black album. there might be one more descent song on the album i forgot to mention. I might go to a pawn shop and by a 3 dollar copy just to see what i missed the off the first time i bought it but from what i remember this album was a true sellout metallica disapointment. I'm sorry James and Lars if you hate me for saying this but THE TRUTH HURTS, and if you hate me then too bad Cliff defenitely don't hate me cause i praised your band back when you played your true style. If you ever get out of this new age conforming junky sound then i will consider you a worthy band like i once did when i considered you my favorite band of all time Like i did back when you were true to Metal."
4,This album doesn't get NEAR enough credit,"Sure, maybe RELOAD isn't the old Metallica, but it is still awesome. Most people say that RELOAD was a worse disappointment than LOAD, but if those non-appreciative-close-minded morons actually LISTENED to RELOAD, then they might actually see that it is a great album. RELOAD is probably the most complex of all the albums that Metallica has ever released (closely rivaled with LOAD). Hammett's playing skills are actually better in RELOAD than in any of their old stuff. I also have to say that Hetfield's voice is much better in this album than in the old stuff. Ulrich's drumming is calmer, but he is still great, too. I'm pleased to say that Newsted's bass playing was more heard, too. RELOAD RULZ!!!"
3,"It's not that it's good or bad, it's how you play the game","For it's STYLE, the album is fine. I have been a metallica fan since Kill ""em All. I think I am more of a Cliff fan, actually. I don't think the music they do now is better, I don't think it is worse. It is simply different. If your musical taste has range, you may like this album. If you prefer alternative over metal, you may like this album. If you are a ""true"" die hard fan of the rooted sound of metallica, you're going to hate this album. It is just time to realize that this is what these guys are doing. It isn't better. It isn't worse. It's different. Although I think it may be different enough for them to change their name to ""Alternica"" - They may have heavy songs, but I don't think you still count them as ""Metal"""
4,Clearly more popular than LOAD,"But only AS good!Tracks like Low Man's Lyric continue in the change of attitued which was dominant in Load whereas Fuel and Unforgiven II (favorite on the album) show the band still clinging to their roots. If you were not a fan of Load (as many of you clearly were not) then there isn't much point in buying this. However, if, like me, you accepted the pace change and appreciated the aforementioned album then this should be ideal!"
3,+++ Re-Deem of Re-Load+++,"This album is maybe one star better for their small effort of trying to redeem thereselves by recording ''The Unforgivin II'' from their huge ''Black'' album, but still reuin every other song with short timing, not good solo's or riffs and slower pace in the music, but still a better album than ''Load''. This one contains three pretty good tunes such as ''Fuel,The Memory Remains, and The Unforgivin II'' and ''Low Man's Lyric'' is really good too if you listen to all of it. I would say go ahead and buy this one if you like MetallicA it's definatly and upgrade from ''Load''"
1,reload that crap,"master,sanitarium,fade to black,orion,blackend etc...... but not this ,at least its better than n sync or is it....sad but true"
2,What Happened on this one guys.,"Ok....i have Been A Hardcore Metallica fan since 1987.Everything that they have released Ive liked, Even Load.I tried my hardest to like this album but just couldnt.I forced Myself to listen to it Hoping it would grow on me...but it just didnt.Although the album has 4 good songs on it they are ""Unforgiven 2"",""Low Mans Lyric"",""Fuel"" and what I consider the best track on the album""Fixxer""It just doesnt hold up to there past albums,Its like this is the album they put together from stuff thaT they had thrown away in the black album and load sessions.Dont get me wrong though...I still have Much respect for Metallica and I support them Not matter what they did.Im Looking forward to there next Album ""St.Anger""."
5,"METALLICA ROCKS, AND CHEAP WANNABES SUCK!","I have one thing to say about thiz album, it is 100% better than any other Metallica CD. ""The unforgiven 2"", ""FUel"", and ""the memory remains"" are the songs you can listen to over and over again, without even getting sick of one second of it. Metallica is still alive, and will live for many heavy metal years to come.Metallica 4 LIFE!!"
5,This album is for all rock listeners. An A or A+ album,"I thought this was a great album. Though it isnt as heavy metal-thrash music that long time Metallica fans have been used to over the years, Metallica is still rockin. People werent very pleased with Load but I think ReLoad is a very Metallica-like album. Definatly Black Album material. Although some self proclaimed True Metallica fans dont care for ReLoad, it just shows that they are not true fans after all. Any real fan would be open to any changes that a band decided to make. I wasnt very happy with Load myself but I still went out and bought ReLoad the day it came out and I was very plaesed. I thought WOW, this is a real bounce back from Load. I am very proud of this album. I have been a fan since the 1983 debut Kill em All and as of the release of this album, I still am. Best songs- Fixxer, Fuel, Slither, Memory Remains, Unforgiven II"
