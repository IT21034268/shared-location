1,Second one stopped working in right ear,The first pair that we got my daughter lasted over a year then the right side stopped working.So we got a second pair and after two and a half months - same problem.I think we will look for a different brand at this point.
3,the sound is amazing`,but after a few months those sliders to adjust size broke and its kind of uncomfortable to wear these the only reason it gets a 3 is because of the sound and the lifetime warranty that i dont think i will be taking advantage of
5,Impressive,"I don't have as much money as I do love for good sound. These are great for the price. I have used much more expensive headphones and been disappointed. A friend has Dre's Beats, and they are very good. Using the Koss PortaPro on my mp3 player (SanDisk Clip) using the FLAC format blew me away. It is a better sound than on the $250.00 Beats on a stupidly expensive Ipod. No doubt the FLAC format has a lot to do with it, but I saved $400.00 over my friend and get very good sound. Very clear, great bass, at all volumes. I usually second guess any purchase I make...happily, not this time!"
5,WOW!,"I spent much time researching good, inexpensive headphones. I often ran into these and so I bought them. Not only do they satisfy me, but I think the sound is absolutely great. In fact, I am very pleasantly surprised that such thin and seemingly delicate headphones could produces such incredible sound! Especially for the price these are a great buy. They are very comfortable as well."
3,Good and Bad,So it folds up. That's nice. It sounds pretty good. That's also nice. But it also feels pretty cheaply built and the connector is not at a right angle so I'm expecting that the wire will begin to break near there from all the bending.
3,Could be better,"The sound is excellent. Very true in all frequencies.However, the metal headpiece is not that comfortable and theit constantly becomes unhinged from the the plastic securing piece.Next time I will stick with the Sennheiser p100."
2,"not good, might try again later","Not sure if anyone else experienced this but mine had some wierd rattle on the left ear that went away if I hit it hard enough or let it play for a few seconds. if I let it ""cool down"" the issue would come back. not sure what it was but had that not been a problem I might have kept them. the sound was average and I do not understand why people say it had ridiculous bass, I don't think it did. This is an average sounding headphone by comparison. nothing to write home about. I got the Sony V6 and those are very good, glad I got those, would like to try the Audio Technica m50 one day. I also got those really popular panasonic earbuds here for like $5.87, those also suck, the JVC Gumy earbuds sound way better. I think those earbuds represent a good value like the Pinnacle PN8+. I know that's not an earphone but the Gumys really are that good of a value at 7 bucks. anyways I might give these portapro another chance...probably not though."
4,PX-100's First Cousin?,"It seems that, like alot of other customers, I've tried both the Porta-Pros & the Sennheiser PX-100's. Overall, the two models are very similar in sound quality & comfort. Still, I would have to give the edge to the Porta-Pros. The Porta-Pros are bit more detailed & have a slightly warmer & richer sound. This should not be much of a surprise since Sennheisers are known for their clear, but ""thin"", sound. Of course there are better headphones out there, but these are a very good value which is why I'm giving them 4 stars. I can't see how anyone could be disappointed with them. After all, there are reasons why this model hasn't changed since they were introduced in 1984."
4,Great quality,"The Koss PortaPro has wonderful stereo quality. Although the over head design looks like it can easily catch your hair, it hasn't caught mine once. The only downside is there is a lot of sound leakage and it hurts my ears after several hours if I don't put them on perfectly aligned."
3,Hasn't been a year and they've already crapped out!,"I ordered these headphones several months ago after hearing all the good reviews and learning about Koss's amazing lifetime warranty. I was sick of buying expensive quality headphones only to have them all break before the year was out, including a pair of ninety dollar Bose earbuds I had gotten several years ago!I figured if the company felt confident enough to have such a great warranty, I had nothing to worry about, right?Wrong, it only took a couple months for the sound to stop working on one side, I had to start adjusting them constantly to get them to work properly until that eventually stopped helping entirely.I loved the compact size and sound quality of these headphones, but I am sad that I will end up having to actually use the warranty after such a short amount of time."
5,Amazing headphones,"For the money, these are one of the best headphones you can get. Not only are they comfortable, but they can pump out outstanding quality sound. I have tried these on many different genres of music and they seem to make everything sound great. To me there was little risk involved and a ton of return."
3,"Lovely sound, perfect portability, but durability could be better.","I just killed my second pair of these, so I'm finally debating whether to get another or try something else. While they're perfect for walking since they don't block out ambient noise but still have great sound quality, both pairs broke in the same way. The wiring at the plug seems to be weak, as with both pairs I lost sound in the right side. Considering that they live in my bag and aren't abused at all, I was somewhat disappointed by this. Otherwise, they're perfect."
1,Dead as received,"Many hours were spent considering the decision to purchase a set of headphones.The Koss PortaPro Headphones won the research.Unfortunately on delivery they did not work!!!!!!!Not a problem, Amazon will replace the defective product they provided.Yes they will, seven days at the earliest, following nine days waiting for the original defective product.Time to shop locally and avoid the disappointment of not dealing with a human being."
3,Good sound but extremely cheap build,"I'm actually a 15 year old who bought these off my mom's account.The only reason I got them was cause I wanted good sound on a budget & after countless good reviews I got these for about $30. I expected the sound to be absolutely fantastic & just blow me away & stuff like that but honestly, the creative in-ear buds I got with my ZEN were better, yet these (Despite the retro look) attracted the attention of my friends & were pretty comfortable. But when we were on the soccer pitch the ball just rolled over these & they were demolished. I had 4 pieces of a Koss set after that. They also kept pinching my hair which doesn't seem like a big deal, but is pretty irritating.So if you're a teen who hopes to buy these because they look like a good deal, don't.Go for a higher quality pair, & hopefully those will last you longer."
1,"Not ""noise cancelling""",These are NOT noise cancelling headphones! In fact they are junk! I am returning my set to Amazon. Don't buy these!
4,very good match for portable player or phone,"No hissing, good sound isolation, can be used for hours (at least by the teens), compact, light and still have large drivers.Lows are not very pronounced, comparing to similarily priced sennheiser HD201, but the size is MUCH smaller too. Since mobile phones are not known to be able to drive lows anyway - perfect match.Very good alternative to the inside-the-ear types that I, personally, cannot tolerate due to the feeling of something foreigh plugging my ears and lack of air circulation.Kid takes them to school and has no problems with peers or administrators.NO, these are NOWHERE near full-size Sony MDR-6, but they are perfect for what they are - mid priced PORTABLE headset for low to mid-price portable electronics."
4,Not bad at all.,"Hate the little earphones that came with my iPod so I bought this headphone to replace it. Excellent sound quality, lots of bass, nice and compact when folded up, and has a little pouch for storage. Not bad for the $$. I in fact ordered another one for my sister to use with her ipod, and she loves it also. I have had it for 3 months now and have no complaints."
5,Super Headphones!,"I am very pleased with these headphones. They produce great sound, are light weight and adjustable, and fold to a very compact size.My only complaint is that they came with an adapter for a large input jack (which is very rarely found) instead of an adapter for two prong jacks (which are required for using these headphones on an airplane). I couldn't even find an adapter at Radio Shack so ended up listening to the audio on the airplane in one ear only. Oh well, otherwise they're great."
5,Terrific Sound at an Unbelievable Cost,Very inexpensive when compared to others rated in its class for quality of sound. Get them as soon as you can. I have not had a problem with the head band capturing my hair and I have used these extensively.
4,good product,these headphones are awesome. i like the open ear design where i can hear what is going on around me. very durable and good sound quality. have been using for a year with no issues
4,A real steal in this day and age,"For $30, you simply can't beat these headphones. When my Bose earbuds died of a short at the jack a few months ago, I started searching for an affordable pair of earbuds/headphones that fit well and had excellent sound. After trying some Klipsch earbuds and Koss over-the-ear headphones, I stumbled onto these via a cnet review. They're great. I wear these at work so it's important that I be able to hear other sounds like a phone ringing or co-workers trying to get my attention. At the same time, I value high quality sound and these, surprisingly, provide. Sound is great. They're light and fairly portable. The only thing I don't like is that even set at the lightest tension setting, they still squeeze my head enough to make my ears a bit sore after a long time (I have big ears - your results may vary). I'm happy I bought these and would recommend them to others."
4,"Great sound, but does ""leak"" sound","As the other reviewers have said, they do sound great, but they allow too much sound to escape. I planned to use them at work, but I can't because of that. Get the ear canal types, or the headphones with an enclosure around the entire ear."
4,Pretty good.,"These headphones are ugly but sound great, they are also very comfortable. Perfect for home, I wouldn't wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noise-cancelling.PROS- Sound is great, bass and all.- iPod/iPhone friendly plug.- Lightweight and comfortable.- The price is right.CONS- Need to re-adjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off.- Not very cool looking, I would probably buy these in black if I was ordering again."
4,Koss PortaPro Headphones,"Pros: Sound fantastic for a $30.00 set. Sound more like a $100.00 set...Cons: The set looks a lot more rugged build in the picture that it does in reality. I would not buy these for a kid or even a teenager. They would not last.For an adult that just appreciate great music and it's not planning to go to the gim or run two miles while listening to your ipod, it's perfect.Greate Base sound without missing on the hight pitch sounds at all. I could not find any distortion on the sound even with my Itouch Ipod 2nd generation blasting at maximum volume."
5,"Great sound from this Koss product, Portapro headphone",This product is priced right... a great value! You'll like the sound and price. Although the product looks dated the sound is great.
5,Koss Porta Pro --Great !!!,"First of all I did a lot of research before buying my Koss PortaPro headphones. I subscribe to Consumer Reports and CNET and the phones got good ratings and reviews at both sites. I am thrilled with my PortaPros, they are everything they are claimed to be: great sound and very light to wear. I would recommend them to everyone.Now, about Amazon.com: I tracked my headphones all the way up to when they said delivered. No phones: I emailed Amazon.com and they sent another pair out no charge via next day air. Two days later I found the first set behind a cellar door that we do not use very much. I sent them back to Amazon.com collect freight. I am more than totally delighted with their service.Boston Bob"
4,Be Yourself,Excellent self-help book which is easy to read and has solutions which can be applied to many of life's troubling circumstances. A shortcut to resolving many of life's dilemas which are not always easy to apply to oneself but frequently this is because insight is sometimes painful to aquire.
3,k.d. lang: live by request,this cd wasn't as dynamic as i had expected. i've seen her really belt out songs but this wasn't one of them. she is still very good.
3,Didn't like this one as much as others,"I love k.d. lang, but did not enjoy this one as much as some of her other works, but then, that's just an opinion. Music, as in all art forms, is a very personal experience and to each her/his own. That said, to give you an idea of my tastes, I absolutely loved her ""Hymns From the 45th Parallel"", but did not enjoy this one. If you are familiar with that CD, and listen to this one, you will hear the difference. But with a voice like hers, she could sing the telephone book and it would be great!"
3,A Title,"Turned out to not be what I was looking for, but it did arrive FAST and better than expected!"
4,"Sweet, Sultry and Oh-So Seductive....","That's K.D. Lang. The collection is a bit weak, especially ""Big Boned Gal"", but it works because K.D. knows how to woo an audience. As the track progresses you get a true feeling of Lang's range, and her dramatic abilities. She is simply electric. This may not be your choice as her best work, but it is a marvelous introduction to a very talented (albeit controversial) recording artist.Blessings,Cris"
3,live but not better,"I was very disappointed with this CD. I saw the concert on TV and it was lovely. The CD on the other hand exhibited poor volume control. The volume level of Ms. Lang's vocals as well as, that of the instruments continously fluctuated. Ms. Lang has a beautiful voice but, it was not showcased on this CD. I struggled to hear her on many of the songs. I would return this CD but, it is the only one that has 'Barefoot' on it."
2,Cynical,"I don't know if the title is a hint as to the origins of this CD, but it wouldn't surprise me if it were released ""by request"" of kd's label, and not her. It certainly does not bear the mark of a release supervised by kd - the vocals are often less than perfect and even off-pitch (given, it's a live record), the song selctions are unadventurous, the arrangements are hackneyed. As an artist, kd is a perfectionist, and this just doesn't come close. As a huge fan, I have to wonder why kd's label (or kd herself?) doesn't have more respect for her work. Hers is a singular talent that deserves better than this off-handed release."
5,THE BEST,"Scruples lifts the hair and adds volume without damage and without making it look stiff. One spray lasts twenty-four hours. I have thin, tough to hold hair and this product works. It brushes out easily. It is the best of the many hair sprays I have tried in my long life."
4,Best bang for your buck,"I believe this is pretty much the best headphone out there for the 20$ price range. while this is the best headphone at its price range, if you are playing extremely strong bass, it will start 'scratching', this is not very noticeable but it would be better if it was different. the overall sound is very nice and compares rather well with the higher price headphones. if you do end up breaking this item koss's lifetime warranty will cover it so no need to buy headphones again and again."
3,Not Good Not Bad,"fair price for the result, i am not really dissapointed. I think what i didn't like is that they are low on bass, and very high on treble. But it doesn't mean you can not enjoy listening to music with these headphones, unless you need a high bass frequency. Ok for an every day use."
4,Amazing bass and quality for the price,"I already had 4 pairs of these...this headphone is the cheapest of PortaPro family, and the sound is excellent, clean, deep bass; high sensitivity, even I can get satisfactory sound level from single-battery walkmanthe reason why I give 4 stars is, the cable is easily broken, and the length is 1.5m, sometimes the cable tangle my feet when I am down on knee, and when I stand up when I don't undo the cable, the cable breaks, and I have repair myself, after that, I lost volume control and the length is reduced to 1mthere's new version comes out, which is KTX-PRO1, which uses plastic headband insteadif you prefer a standard headphone for about 20 bucks, this one is a must buy, you shall not regret for the sound"
3,"Great bass, boom,boom RATTLE...RATTLE!!!","WOW! great headphones, right? Yes and NO. I got mine a year ago so I have some long term experience with these, and they were great at first. I showed them off to my friends, and I even convinced my friend to buy a pair from Radio Shack.(KTXpro+Optimus PRO-35, same thing...) He loves his so far, and everyone around me also. After about 8 months, they started RATTLING. This is VERY annoying because every time a drum hits on the music, a distinct RATTLE enters the soundfield. This, as I said is VERY ANNOYING!!! I dont think there is any way to prevent this from happening, these just dont age very well. Dont get me wrong, these are the BEST sounding headphones I own now,(Im going to buy Sony MDR-V6's) but the RATTLING just becomes too annoying for me to give 5/5 stars.BASS: 9/10-great bass, believe me. TREBLE:10/10-excellent,excellent,excellent. good for rap,classical,rock, anything or people who dont mind RATTLING."
2,Disappointed and Feeling Ripped Off,"I bought these headphones based on the first couple of reviews I read here. I should have read further, because about two weeks after I purchased the earphones, the left side went out completely. There was nothing obvious on the outside of the unit and I didn't hear any ""rattling"" as described by other users. The darn things just quit! I must say, however, that the sound quality for those first two weeks was excellent, but all in all, not worth the money and frustration."
1,big and uncomfortable,"I'm probably going to try to return these - they are dorky big and when I put them on the ear pads seem to point the wrong way, really uncomfortable. I wanted a nice portable set for my MP3 player (which supposedly came with inferior 'phones) but these really aren't, the ear bits are about 2"" x 4"" and they don't fold up very compactly."
5,Exellent for my Vacuum Tube Gear,I use this headphone with my Vacuum Tube Headphone Amplifier. Works great. Deep bass and clear high frecs. Great value.
3,"Great sound, lousy durability","I have had my set for five months. The sound is excellent. Unfortunately, the wire needs a strain relief where it enters and exits the volume control. I suggest finding a spring about twice the size of a ball point pen refill spring and twist it over the wire and onto the rubber grommets that extend from the volume control. Maybe then the wire will last longer. The KOSS people will replace a broken set but you have to mail it in with a check for $6.00 for return postage. That is what they call a lifetime warranty.For those who want occasional ear cover style, I pop the ear pieces out of the headband and put them inside a cheap set of noise blocking ear muffs like they sell for a couple bucks at the tool store."
4,Excellent sound quality!,"I'm not an audiophile, but this pair of headphones deliver clear, crisp trebles and mids and strong, well-defined bass. The volume control is very convenient, especially when I do not have convenient access to the volume control say in the school computer labs. The head band is a tad too tight though (though it grips nicely), and after one year of use, the plastic around the band broke. Nevertheless I will still buy another from Koss again. They make great sound!"
1,NAUSEATING!!!,"Barbra has given so much of herself over the years from Broadway, to film, more albums than any popular artist has recorded, interviews, charitable events, etc. That is the worrk that will last. I don't see why we just can't appreciate her works and stop trying to dissect her. Talent, charisma, etc. is the very thing that draws the public to a star; but there must be a boundary drawn between fan adoration and psychopathic drama. I don't believe Barbra has any record to set straight, especially on Oprah. I think it would be like speaking against the devel incarnte Christopher Andersen and giving his no-factual book credence it doesn't deserve. If Barbra chooses ""to set the record straight"" I'm sure it will be in her own time and in her own wonderful way!"
1,Christopher Andersen is a miserable wretch.....deserves to be burned at the town green for such mean spiritedness!!!!!!,"Why do people like to trash icons.......especially Barbra who is brilliant in everything she undertakes.....singing, comedy, acting, producing, directing.....you name it.....she and Bette Midler are my two favorite famous women.....I am shocked at the publisher for printing this book!!!!!"
1,Lost in Translation,"Like other books by Christopher Anderson I've read, this book has absoluely no merit."
1,NOT FOR STREISAND FANS,"Dear Readers:This book is NOT for Streisand fans. It's not even for anyone who deems themselves a lover of humanity. For someone to claim that Steisand fans will love this book is an abomination and an obvious ploy to sell a book that isn't doing as well as expected. Animonisity starts in a twisted mind such as Mr. Andersen must have, and then spreads throughout our culture and our world. Ultimately it breeds contempt between people that ends in wars and desecration. And I want no part of it. If you don't think the one thing has anything to do with the other, give it a little thought."
1,Read the National Enquirer Instead,"Don't waste your money on this ""tell-all"" book. It's written in a mean spirit by someone who obviously dislikes Barbra. I should have been forwarned of the author's intent just by reading the inside jacket sleeve...""SURPRISING NEW DETAILS ABOUT HER WEDDING AND MARRIAGE TO JAMES BROLIN""...""A PROVOCATIVE INSIDE ACCOUNT OF WHAT REALLY WENT ON BETWEEN STREISAND AND BILL CLINTON IN THE WHITE HOUSE..."" Sound familiar? Every tabloid out there screams the same type of attention-grabbing headlines. This book was written by someone who dislikes Barbra and apparently her success at what she does. I stopped reading this awful book at page 78. Even looking through random pages, I found the same negative tone...Mr Andersen's one-sided opinions and nothing more. This book is going in the trash."
1,Too much gossip; not enough truth,"Barbra Streisand has been an icon for the past 40+ years. She has given so much musical pleasure and film enjoyment that I can hardly contain myself. Everytime she appears on camera even for TV specials, it is a main event. I wish someone would explore the value of what her talent has captured to so many people all over the world instead of reporting gossipy rumours."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,This is noothing but a re-hash of old artciles from the rumour mill. Nothing new here and a not a very good read. Couldn't finish it.
1,Rehashment of everything that's come before,"This is nothing more than a rehashment of other books, articles,, gossip, rumor, facts previously known, etc. A tabloid Hollywood work. Really not worth any low price. Anderson is not known as a classy writer of Hollywood biographies. When Streisand pointed out an error regarding her sister's wedding, Anderson retorted with, ""That's one small error."" Streisand says that she will not go into further errors, so we will not knowhow many others there are for sure, but I bet there are quite a few. Leave it on the shelf."
4,The way she really is....,"I have no problem believing everything written in this book. Streisand is egoistic, very controlling with no regards for anybody, even for those who helped her reach the top. And I don't care how many awards she got in her career, it is not a noble attitude. I am not particularly fond of people with such a big ego, using people for their own advantage and afterwards ignoring them like they never even existed. Walter Matthau was right when he said: ""Who the hell does she think she is""! She may be an icon for many people... not for me."
1,Junk-Food Hatchet Job,"First let me say that I had no hard, pre-conceived notions about Ms. Streisand upon starting this book. I had heard, like everyone else, what a pain in the -ss perfectionist she could be. But this book is just one gossipy anecdote after another. In the final pages, he tells us that she is going to record her 60th album, and after all that reading, I had only heard about a handful...The way he relates her life, she was too busy being a narcissistic b-tch to have time to record 60 albums. I'm sure there's truth to the stories, but this can't be the whole truth. I wish I'd read a more thorough biography on her, not this gossip column of a book."
2,People Who Hate People.......,"Why write a book to make someone unhappy.... Then again, why write a book if the person one writes about has passion, compassion, and a desire to live a truthful, artistic, perfectionistic, and full life AND the writer has little or no interest to (try to) understand. Perhaps only a person who does not admire, like, or understand what makes a true fully human being. I think the book is about writing about someone the writer knows little about and, as a writer, lacks the intuition to see how truly special this person is as an interesting subject one can learn to appreciate as a reader. And also.....Not a greatly written book technically either."
3,What a Pill!,"It's amazing to me that just because someone is talented in some area, people give them a pass on oft-times BOORISH behavior. Gad! Mr. Andersen has done a great job of portraying Ms. Streisand in all her self-absorbed glory. Well-written and researched, this is a great read for all but the most blindly-adoring of her fans."
2,Why the vendetta?,"Boy, does someone have an axe to grind with Barbra or what? OK, so it's not big news that Barbra Streisand can be difficult to work with, is a perfectionist, may have a high opinon of herself. But the author takes every opportunity to knock her. Even those who had to work with her on movie sets where she might have been demanding admit that her suggestions, her know-it-all attitude was often correct. And can Barbra do nothing right? Early on he takes her to task for her lack of grooming, later on for her fastidious dressing and nails. With this author, Barbra couldn't win. The entire book has a gossipy feel to it that made many of the observations suspect. Bottom line? Next time I'll look for an objective author, not someone out to malign his subject."
2,A Hard-bound Tabloid Story,"""Barbra: The Way She Is"" isn't a biography so much as a 412-page National Enquirer story, offering more gossip than insight on its subject. The author and his editors don't even bother to check simple facts like who directed ""Patton"" and what was Jack Nicholson's debut movie, calling into question other assertions Christopher Anderson makes in his book, like all but claiming Streisand had affairs with Bill Clinton and Prince Charles. I'll admit I couldn't put the book down, but when I was done I wished I'd spent my time reading something else."
1,One Voice!,"I tried to say before that this is a one-dimensional look at a multi-dimensional talent yesterday, but I guess I have to elaborate on that for my review to be posted. I'm afraid though, if I do elaborate, that my post will be removed because of the explosive words I would use to describe my personal dislike of Christopher Andersen's non-talent for writing. But rather I'll just say how inappropriate I thought the book is and hope that my review is appropriate enough to be posted."
1,Hateful and Awful,This book is not a biography but rather a littany of volatile slurs. So much mis-information when in print seems to count for the truth. This book is the furthest thing from the truth or from Barbra Streisand. I recommend you buy the double CD The Essential Barbra Streisand instead. You'll get far more than your money's worth and more hours of enjoyment than the pain it takes to read this book.
1,NOTHING??,"Was there nothing good that he could have said about her? Surely being famous for 40+ years she must have done something right...according to this author, NOTHING!! Don't waste your time or money on this..."
1,Drib Drab,"I was more disappointed with this book than I can say!I've long been looking for a biography on Barbra that has the excitement about it that her performances have, the allure about it that a glance on screen can give, and the thought that a photo can provoke. Nobody so far, least of all Christopher Andersen, seems to have gotten it quite right. I've read a couple of previous Barbra biographies, believe you me, nothing new here. Certainly the convention has been to treat Barbra Streisand as a controversial subject. And I've long stopped trying to figure that one out."
1,Even marked down it's not worth the time,This book is a travesty none of which is believable. The author must be incredibly insecure to attack Ms. Stresiand in such a manner.
1,What a Crock!,"The thing that is so grotesque about Christopher Anderson is that he makes his living decomposing the lives of people who are most admired. He uses their names and images to sell books - if you can call them that. I mean they have pages that are bound together, but they hardly enlighten or are even fair in spirit. The only thing Mr. Anderson reveals in any of his books is his own pathology."
1,Just Awful!,"I really tried! I mean there I was reading the first couple of chapters and really I tried to enjoy this book! But in the end I only made it to the point where Barbra is about to film ""Funny Girl"" and I simply gave up.This guy seems to be adding whatever he can to make Barbra Streisand anything but what she really is., a true talent and a great humanitarien."
1,Cheap Talk,"Just because the author states the undeniable brilliance of Barbra's talent does not mean that the rest of the book is accurate, coherent, or a valid work."
1,Bottom line - This book is TRASH!,Bottom line - This book is TRASH! It's author is nothing more than a gossip columnist who loves the sound of his own pen. Apparently Mr. Andrerson can't think of anything original to write about on his own and must resort to defaming popular figures in order to validate the space he takes on the planet. He is out for nothing more than to make money at the expense of someone else's hard work and earned station. His treatment of Streisand is far too contrived and poorly crafted for my taste. His approach to one who has inspired so many millions is uninspired. Perhaps Christopher Anderson should begin to look for another line of work.
1,Misguided!,"This book did absolutely nothing for me. Barbra is such a fascinating person as well as being an extraordinary talent. She speaks her mind truthfully as to reveal exactly where her heart is. She has stood up, donated, and helped raise fortunes for meaningful causes throughout her brilliant career. She certainly deserves a better treatment of her life story than this. And so do we."
5,One of the best books in the series,"WHen we last left off in the series Gaia was leaving to go to Germany with the man she thought was her trusted Uncle Oliver who was dying from cancer. Ed undergoed massive surgery that could possibly let him walk again and Sam finds himself falling in love with Gaia and involved in the murder case of his friend. Now to tell you what happened in this book whould be a crime becasue I'd be spoiling it for you. Let's just say it has a lot less action, but is a lot more emotional. It's an important novel in the series that's sure to change everything, and everyone in it. It also reminds you on how evil Heather is. You'll never look at her the same way again after this book! I reccomend this book for anyone who loves the Fearless Series. You need to read this one!"
4,Satisfying,"After the long anticipation for this next book in the series, I found it to be pretty satisfying. Gaia finally has Sam, and she finally has her father. However, it has an interesting twist. Instead of Gaia feeling more pain and getting into more trouble, Ed and Sam are taking that role. The book had less of a cliffhanger than most of the others, and had less action like the others in the series. Though it was very good, it wasn't the best. I am still interested to see what happens when Gaia gets back to New York in the next book, and I can't wait to read it."
3,"Content is good, but low (technical) quality.","First of all, the source of this video is a DVD, so we're talking standard definition here. And then the streaming quality is not that good, highly compressed. I didn't expect HD, but better quality from Amazon."
2,Boring,This video was quite long and boring-there was too much history and not enough actual Tai Chi going on. There has to be better videos out there.
5,Excellence at a very affordable price,"I am a novice, and have wanted to learn Tai Chi for a long time. Tried a few other DVDs and quickly gave up - mostly due to the instructors rushing through the lessons and providing insufficient detail ,,,or not breaking down the sequence sufficiently for a novice to follow. This s approximately my 5th week of viewing and reviewing the content and attempting to learn from it. I must say that this is one of the best - if not the absolute best - instructional presentations that i have ever seen. Kudos to the producers and the entire teaching team led by Dr. Yang. Because of this DVD, i am sure i will learn all the 37 movements .... as he says, ""don't rush through this one"".... tai chi is not easy and it takes time and practice to learn this great art."
1,"Dont buy it, is a waste of money,Useless DVD",Dr Yang like to show himself and use 60% of the frame to show himself in artistic pose but the pose of the exercise is very small on the side not been able to see it well because is to small. You have to come very near to the screen to be able to see the Tai Chi position.Who ever made this DVD had no idea of what the buyer needs in order to copy the exercise from the DVD and do it life.Others DVD thayt I have bought have the same problem . The profesors seems to be exhibitionist who only want to advertise themself with our money
3,ho hum,"Way, WAY too much talk and not enough show. Much better to have alive teacher, learn the moves, and let the teacher make the little corrections necessary. I was disappointed. This isn't usable for me. I'm too old to stay standing as long as necessary with this just to get a few of the moves done!"
4,Like the explanation; the speed is good for a beginner,I like his explanation of the moves & why its important to be precise. Dr. Yang also shows moves within a group & you are able to see different variations on the move.
5,Wonderful training!,"I love Mr. yang style of Tai Chi and consider him a real master. The DVD is clear, serious and well made.I recommend this DVD for any one who had already a teacher and is whiling to practice some times alone.I use this DVD while I travel around the globe and it is very useful! Helps me a lot to be connected wit thiswonderful martial art! Mr. Yang has a very simple way to explain the exercises and shows that he is a real master!If you never have done any Tai Chi before I recommend go first to a teacher and then use this Dvd. Thank you for Mr Yang toshare such ancient knowledge in a DVD!"
5,Good Buy!,This scale works great. Fast and accurate. Good price. And a Cusinart. How can you go wrong?
5,Best Soundtrack Without a Film Award,"Hard Cash is the soundtrack intended for a BBC Northwest documentary that, according to one online source, was first broadcast in 1990. After hearing the album (we have it on LP) we searched in vain for the film on DVD (or should I say, VHS?). In any case, the CD makes one hell of a British folk ""sampler"". I'm familiar with the work of most of the artists, and in my opinion the project inspired some of their best work. I guess when you're included among such company, your contribution had better be strong. One listen should encourage the listener to seek out more stuff of theirs."
2,Not up to snuff,"Loud and does not come close to its advertised spec of being able to shred 7 pieces of paper at once. It actually has difficulty with 3 pages of standard printer paper. (Could it be that the spec refers to tissue paper? ) So after about two years of light home office use, it is now dead. Is that all that one can expect from a Fellowes shredder?"
4,True Customer Satisfaction!!,I love the price! I love the quick delivery! I love the packaging! It was all around greatness! Thank you for making me smile!
3,Pretty Dry,This was a required book for my class and it was really like a typical textbook that it's a bit dry and long in definition of things.
5,The RFP book that htelp me to do the job well done,"I was in charge to define the RFP for a big imaging system project and this book gave me the tools to plan, supervise and create the RFP that point out the requirements, so the providers can easily develop the correct solution in their proposal.This book is ahead. Has very good explanation (easy to read and understand), well structured and the examples are good to have a clear idea of the content that should have all the topic of the RFP. It gave me the tools to map the plan, the definition of the requirements and the development of the RFP document.This book must be in any library."
2,A mediocre resource at best,"There is a need for a good, inexpensive book on RFP writing. Unfortunately, this is not it. No offense to the author, but this book is weak. The book assumes that all RFP's are about IT projects and doesn't even mention the possibility that an RFP might be issued for anything else. Materials? Contracting? Outsourcing? Never even mentioned. Do yourself a favor and try to find another book."
3,IndieReader Review,"Summer Sleep-Away is the tale of a twelve-year old boy at summer camp for the first time. Will he fit it? Will he make friends? Will it be better than at home where his parents are fighting all the time?Far from home, separated from his family and not knowing a soul, Mattie Kleinfeld is scared, homesick and cries himself to sleep. But soon the tears give way to new friends and fantastic adventures. Mattie goes hiking and fishing. He sails and swims and plays in team sports. But it is not the canoe trips or the overnights that set this summer apart; it is not even his first girlfriend. It is a clue that he and his friends stumble upon that lead to the adventure of a lifetime.Sweet and innocent, Summer Sleep-Away will keep kids engaged and remind adults what it felt like to be a kid far from away from home for first time.Reviewed by Cindy Erdesohn**IndieReader gives this book 3.5 stars**"
4,Short and quick workout,"This is a great workout, if you are short on time and can't workout. There are 3 ten minute workout routines, I personally enjoy the very first routine and the time goes by so quickly. This is a great workout for your buns and legs. I only wish the workouts were at least 15 minutes instead of 10. However, I am happy with the results that I am starting to see."
4,Good book,In this book Lulu falls and Snow White is hurt. Lulu blames herself and says she will never ride again. Can Pam and Anna get her back in the saddle? Read to find out. This shows that accidents can happen and they aren't your fault.
3,good pony pal book,"''The missing pony pal book is o.k,but it is not my faveroite.I like the part when lulu gos in the woods.I would also reccomend the pony and the haunted barn."
3,fisheye lense,I purchased this product for my videocamera -sony HC-46. Unfortunately the step up ring provided with it doesn't fit my camera. it was 37mm to 30 mm.I needed 37 to 25mm ring wich i had to purchase separately. It wouldn't be a bad idea to specify the step up ring size in the product description.
2,: WARRANTY no good!,"I would have given it 4 stars but the poor customer service from Fellowes marked it down. Cost vs performance, product is good.'Customer Care' A true measure is when one has problems with the product and how the Co. responds. Fellowes does NOT stand behind their product. The 5 Year Cutter warranty given by them is not worth the cardboard it is printed on. 18 months in and I am having problem with the cutters. Fellowes throws in a host of excuses and is unhelpful. I now have a piece of $99 (when I purchased it) junk.I would have gladly come to some resolution that even require me to pay for a repair. But, no, they will not or cannot help, thus Fellowes OD1200 has to be thrown in the garbage (their recommendation)Do your own homework/research. Fellowes does NOT stand behind their product."
1,awful,"This cream was very thick, I should have known what it would do to my hair. I could hardly get a comb through it after applying it, gave up trying to get my hair to look normal, had to wash it again. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Yuck!,"I don't know what it is about this stuff but it's just BAD! It's so thick and sticky. It makes hair styling such a pain, you just end up washing your hair again to get it all out! It doesn't go on evenly, dry or wet! I don't recommend this at all!The 2 stars are only because it smells so good. :|"
1,Old Product,I purchased this product at the store and fell in love with it. Reordered it on the website and was disgusted to receive two containers of what was supposed to be the same great product. What I received shouldn't even be sold...old product...useless!
1,To Thick & Sticky!!,This stuff is so thick and sticky; I thought some of my hair was coming out as I tried to apply it. Would not recommend.
4,"Nice toy, futue software will make better.","The PIM is everything it appears, small and functional. I thought it would be great for mainly reading stuff, but inputing info is pretty damned nice (no funky handwriting techniques needed). Passwords, the web thing all nice.The sync software is the weakest point, it's a little soft, but it works fine for me (win2K and win98)."
1,Rex Rumor Central,"Even if the Rex 6000 turns out to be the best invention of mankind, I have to give it a 1-star rating due to Xircom's (or Intel's? They just bought Xircom) failure to deliver, to keep promises and to provide adaquate customer support. Anyhow, if you would like to know what other people think, or if you are still waiting for your Rex to materialize, go to the Rex Rumor Central at http://www.linkmagnet.com/rex/rextalk.html."
1,Disappointment,"I found this book to be very poorly written. Though full of many stories it lacked any concrete or practical information. For example, the next time I'M lost and I can't find a railroad electrical house to break into and take insulation from to keep warm what shall I do?"
4,Great for price,this is your basic knife set. I've had it for 3 months and so far so good. Plus you can't beat the price!
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I have been looking for a new knife set for our new home for awhile and saw these knifes were the right price and had a good rating so I went to the store to check them out but in the store they make it so you cannot remove the knifes I thought the handle looked cheap but again it had such a great review I thought I can't go wrong,Well I got them home and compared them to my old knifes they cut the same as my now rusted and dull knifes and the blade is very cheap I took mine back to the store and ordered a set from online for twice the cost but 5x the quality...Please Avoid These Knifes There A waste Of Money!"
5,Hunter's second-bes,"Jack Hunter's best spy story, second in quality only to The Blue Max, the air-combat story which was his first novel. Tense, clever and original, OOUWFT is clearly based on his own experiences as an Army counter-intelligence officer in Germany at the end of WWII. Hunter's plot tricks are clever and unexpected (unlike in many of his later works which recycle many of his characterizations, events and descriptions) and his view of spy-vs-spy at the birth of the Cold War is unique."
2,Agreed,"Okay, i absolutely love this show with all my heart..but the same thing happened to me when i bought this set. i bought it from best buy and had to return it 3 times before it actually worked. on the first 2 sets, the discs were all scratched and alot of the episodes couldnt play. Also, the extras just seem extremely disappointing. You would think you get something fabulous for $200. I should have just stuck with the individual seasons i had sold to buy this :("
3,Two Discs are not unviewable,"I haven't viewed the whole series, however, so far, Season Two, Disc One is just a bundle of squares/blocks of color/jagged images. Same with Season Three, Disc Three. I love SATC TV series and movies so glad to at least have the discs and movies to view when I want but obviously disappointed with these two unviewable (if that's a word) discs. Haven't had time to view the remaining discs and the movies but hoping they're ok. Packaging is 'fabulous'!"
2,Some of the episodes don't work,"Ordered this as a gift for a friend that had never seen the series, but there are serious issues with several of the episodes not working. Attempted to view on Blu-Ray/DVD player and also several laptops and the issue remains."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!!!!,"It's not the fault of amazon.com, but HBO. I'm not complaining about the show, but the quality of these DVD's. I'm in the process of returning my replacement set for a REFUND, not another replacement. Neither the first, nor the second set worked. Don't even waste your time. All of us who purchased the set and then got a replacement should receive a personal apology from HBO because they obviously went that extra mile to show their appreciation for their loving fans..."
4,"Love the Show, shame about the presentation","Great show, shame about the crappy HBO packaging with its cheap plastic boxes that literally fall apart within weeks!"
1,Duplicate Disks!!,"I bought this for a gift on the Gold Box Deals. My friend starting going through her DVDs no problem until she got up to Season 3. There were TWO #3 disks, but there was no #2 disk anywhere!! What to do?!?! It is too late to send back for exchange or a refund!! What a crock!!!"
1,SCRATCHED,"Dont get me wrong, if it wasnt for the fact most of my disc for this item was scratched then it wouldve totally got 5 stars from me but that wasnt the case. Its too expensive for me to have recieved dvds i couldnt even watch. And on top of that, the seller i recieved it from CD WAREHOUSE or something like that was at first helpful but he sent me out the wrong replacement disc for one and when i bought it to his attention he was completely rude about it and gave me a 10 dollar refund to shut me up! Anyhow if i could leave this complaint under feedback i would but lucky for him it was already off my history so i couldnt. Anyhow, for the most part I LOVE THIS ITEM but i would NEVER buy from that vendor again."
1,The complete collection of Sex & the City,"I was charged $127 for this on Dec 9,2010 but my mother did not receive the order. I will report this to my credit card company and Amazon.com."
4,Great Show...Great Set...One Issue,"This is a fabulous t.v. show, in an awesome package. And this is coming from a man! Amazon once again provided the best price and primo service. We did have a similar issue that other buyers had, e.g. one of our discs wouldn't work. Amazon replaced the set at no cost and virtually no hassle to us, the replacement worked great. One star ding for the initial product failure."
4,Perfect Gift!,"The best part of buying the complete series is the case it comes in. We borrowed the complete series from a friend who had it in parts and aside from the fact that those packages sucked and fell apart, it was a hassle keeping it all together.In this set, its like a little binder with pockets for individual discs.It really is worth it."
4,Great but damaged,Outstanding series !! But beware season 3 does not work !! Even if you exchange it the replacement has the same flaw. Would have been a 5 if HBO didn't screw up season 3
3,Sputtering...,"I bought this version of the dvd set and love the series. Unfortunately, the ""sputtering"" happens on every dvd player we have including the computer dvd player and playstation2. It's throughout the seasons and annoying because sometimes you're missing a few seconds or a few minutes. We've tried playing through it in slow motion but it just freezes completely or skips. With such a smartly written show, any dialogue missed is very upsetting. We're trying to return it and just buy the used versions of the individual box sets. It's just awful."
1,Defective Sex and the City Sets,"So far I've received 2 of the complete sets of Sex and the City and I've had to send back both. Both have discs that are defective and just won't play. A serious disappointment for us Sex and the City fans, but Amazon is still working with me and hopefully I'll get one that works. Perhaps just a bad batch."
1,Sodom and Gomorrah,"This is a TERRIBLE piece of american culture, and truly illustrates everything that is wrong with western culture. THere is not one redeeming quality in the entire series. The actresses who play the supposedly fabulous characters are anything but. No man in his right mind would be attracted to these ugly skanky women. also I found the whole series to be quite misogynistic since all the women characters are so wholly negative. Plus it seems that the writer is perhaps making the statement that professional women who focus on their careers are ugly, bitter sex crazed whores, which is what these characters are. What I don't get is their sex or reliationships could be special after the ten thousandth sexual encounter. This does not bode well for our country."
1,Mundane Poison,Length:: 6:28 MinsHere's some general thoughts on this series. I ended up doing it in four parts but only one could be posted here.
1,Forced to watch,I bought this serie for my wife (who loves it) but the episodes I have been forced to watch make me wish I would have just gone with diamonds for Christmas. Just terrible.
2,Isn't here yet,I have not received my dvds yet. They are several days late and the seller wont contact me back. I'm not happy
4,Complete sex,"There are a few Sex and the City complete series out there, but this is the nicest one to own. The velvet cover, scrap book type of packaging all made the price tag worth it.My only complaint is the video quality for Season 1 is quite bad. I only hope that they could have polished up the image."
5,Sex and the City gift set,"The price was right, and the packaging is better than expected. To watch and rewatch Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte & of course SAM at my lesiure is like having therapy for the single girls at my fingertips! I am glad I spent part of my stimulus package (thank you Mr. President) on such a fine product. If you are a fan, this is something you cannot be without."
5,Great comprehensive set,"For romatics or SATC fans this is as good as it gets. All the seasons are entertaining, funny, sexy, interesting, intelligent... having them all together is priceless"
3,Very disappointed!,"I was so excited to start watching the series again, but became very disappointed when I realized the dvds I purchased were scratched. What a let down!"
1,DVDs don't work,DVDs would not play on either my stand-alone DVD player or my computer DVD drive. These discs are defective.
3,You can buy all the seasons individually for less,"Just an FYI. If you order each of the 6 seasons individually for about $20 ea. (there are 7 sets total, because season 6 is broken into 2). From what I can see, you can save about $60 buying them individually and the content is the same. Sure, the packaging might not be as nice, and the individual box sets will take up more space, but seriously... is that really worth the extra $60?"
1,Expected higher quality packaging,"I am a huge SatC fan and I was VERY disappointed with the quality and packaging of this boxed set. Its basically a ringed binder with cheap cardboard sleeves for the DVDs which rip easily. I ordered one set and discovered that half of the DVDs skipped, were scratched or didnt play at all. Thinking this was an isolated incident, I returned it and got a replacement set. My replacement set had the same problem. There must have been something wrong with this print run. So I ended up returning both sets. Needless to say, for almost $200 I expected a lot more quality."
2,Good But Not Great!,"I bought this for my wife and another one for her friend on her birthday because they are Sex And The City junkies. As noted by other reviews, the quality of the DVD's are not that great. In both packages that we received some of the individuals shows don't play. Our experience is that the episodes skip from time to time. We tried them on two DVD players and two notebook computers with the same response. You will get most of the shows to play but it is hit or miss. We didn't bother sending them back since we expected to get the same quality in exchange. If you have the money, buy each season individually and you won't have any problems."
3,"Best series ever, but what happened to the picture quality ?","This series is fantastic. Presentation is fantastic.What happened to the picture quality on series 1 - 4 ? It is very grainy and at times looks like you are watching a bad copy.Series 5 and 6 are better quality, but not fantastic.I have exchanged three times now at the place of purchase, but still there is no improvement.I have a new LCD tv and dvd, so it is not the equipment.You really notice the poor quality when you watch another dvd.I have just bought each series individually and the quality is much better. Go figure."
1,What a mess,"I ordered this item expecting to be happy because I love the show. But when I ordered the item, I found that some of the disks skip and don't play right. I had a replacement ordered and that skiped to. You can imagine my frustration. I had to return this item twice. I finally decided to buy it directly from HBO, I hope that these disks work. My recommendation:Don't buy this item from Amazon!"
1,Awful.,Very bad experience. Many of the DVDs did not work. Why does Amazon continue to market this product when they are aware of the product flaws?
1,Damaged,"Most of the episodes in the seasons 3, 4, and 6 did not play because of damaged CDs. I like the series but disappointed with the shipment."
1,Discs damaged,"I should have read other reviews before ordering this product. Many of the BRAND NEW discs skipped, got stuck or did not play at all. By the third season it was no longer one or two episodes, but almost an entire disc that was unplayable. Very disappointed. I returned this product."
1,ALL SCRATCHED UP!!! NOT WATCHABLE!!!!!,"ok, so i just got my dvd set today and was SOOOO excited to sit and have a SATC marathon. unfortunately, these dvds are unwatchable because they are scratched beyond belief. it was brand new in packaging but the dvds are in HORRIBLE condition and there are black smears/smudges on the inside box set in the back. it looks like it was used and stepped on and beaten and just put in saran wrap. i should have listened to the other reviews. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!"
4,Sex and the City,I received the dvds in record time and was pleased with the condition of the product.
5,Great Complete Series,"Finally have to chance to watch this complete set of series. Love the story line and every character. I though sexiness and acting do not mix, but Sarah proved me wrong. She is not only sexy but also an excellent and a very cool actress."
5,AMAZON IS THE BEST E-SHOP IN THE WORLD,I THINK THAT YOUR OFFER OF THIS ITEM WAS THE BEST I FOUND IN INTERNET.
2,What to do with damaged goods?,I ordered brand new dvds and at least three discs skipped. What do I do with them? I also checked the pricing and I over paid. I could get the same dvds at Sam's Club for less.
2,"Hey suckers! Don't buy the singles, watch 'em on Netflix then buy the whole box later!","I never buy single season dvds. You know they will eventually bring out the complete box! Just rent them cheaply through Netflix and hold out until the complete set is available. Otherwise, make the studios richer by buying everything twice!"
1,Do not understand the appeal heere.,Ok let me start by saying im a guy and Iam almost positive this show's target audience is 16-30 year old women. Ive watched about 4 episodes total of this show with my girlfriend. Not only was there not much of a plot to these episodes but the voice over of Sarah Jessica Parker throughout the entire episode kind of wears on you. All the men in the show are either gay or are made out to be a tyrant of some sort. And basically it just seems like a show were a group of women complain about their encounters and love life. Blah blah blah blah blah............. I really dont see the appeal to this at all.
1,I HATE THIS SELLER!,I MADE A PURCHASE 3 WEEKS AGO AND IT HASN'T BEEN SHIPPED! I HAVE SENT 3 EMAILS WITH NO RESPONSE! THERE IS NO PHONE TO CONTACT THE SELLER I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!!!!!!! I NEED TO CANCEL THIS ORDER AND I JUST DONT GET A REPLY DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!
2,not very happy with the product,pc made dvd's--i thought i was getting the real box series but i got a fake.
1,Defective product,I had the same issues that other reviewers experienced with the DVD's. Amazon has sent me two different sets and neither will play several episodes in Season 3. I also tried multiple DVD players and computers.There is something wrong with the manufacturing of this product.
3,"Not a review, just an observation and a question","I haven't purchased this set, but by my count, it'd be a lot cheaper to buy the individual seasons rather than the Complete Series box set (actually, the best deal seems to be to buy the Seasons 1-5 box set, then Season 6-I and Season 6-II individually). If the box set contains extras not found in the individual season releases, that might make it a worthwhile purchase....Which leads me to my question: does the Complete Series box set include something extra that you won't get if you purchase the seasons individually? Seasons 2, 3, 4, 6-I, and 6-II, contain 3 discs, and Seasons 1 and 5 contain 2 discs, for a grand total of 19 discs. Yet, the contents of the Complete Series box set is listed at 20 discs? Where is that extra disc coming from? Would anyone who has this box set care to comment or write a review on that?"
5,"Great Series, but what about the Price?","I love this series. I saw a couple of episodes out of order and had a little bit of a hard time watching, but when I started renting the series and watching, I couldn't stop until the whole show was over. The thing that confuses me about this box set, however, is the fact that if you buy each season separately you save over fifty dollars. Can someone enlighten me as to why it is more expensive to buy the box set? Thanks"
1,Check all your discs immediately!!!!,I ordered this set twice and both had at least one unplayable disc (season 3 disc 3). For this much money I expect a lot more than awful cardboard!
5,Sex and the City - The Complete Series,"This is the 2005 edition. However it has all 94 episodes and the Bonus Disc that includes: En-Sex-Lopedia, Sex Essentials, Location Location Location, You can quote me on it, and The Quest list.I think it is a good deal for the price."
1,Quality-Quality-Quality,I am on my third set after returning the first two. Various disks would skip or just freeze outright making it impossible to watch. Really unacceptable considering the price and the fact that it is not an isolated incident.
2,Pauses... Skips... But NO SCRATCHES!,"My roommate and I both purchased this series. The higher in episodes, the lower the quality. Season 4 of my roommates set won't play at all! I tolerate the pauses ONLY because I'm overseas and this is my ""entertainment"". My roommate, on the other hand.... She's ready to throw her set into a lake of fire! Would NOT recommend."
1,Sex and the City,"I tried to play these DVDs on two DVD players, SONY and SANYO(they were not cheap players) and my new DELL laptop. Had the same problem on each. The THIRD DISC of each season had a problem. Some seasons the THIRD DISC had 2-3 episodes that would break up and one THIRD DISC would not play at all. Why did the first and second disc of each season play beautifully without any problems at all? I have NEVER experienced any problems on my players before. If the manufacturer is aware of the problem, why not list the players that it will not have problems!!! Why offer these for sale this way? Why can they not manufacture them without the problems???? Very disappointed with this, I was looking forward to watching this wonderful series in entirety. Too bad the other collection is also made by the same manufacturer."
3,It is good but..,"The problem I am encountering is a technical one, I was told by tech support for my widescreen tv that the dvd's are not formatted to show the image in its original old tv scale size. What is happening is on a widescreen tv it pulls the image to the width, and chops off the top and bottom. I tried making setting adjustments on the dvd player and the tv, but nothing happens so it must be the way the dvds are manufactured."
4,"Obviously the series is great, but...","If you're reading this review, you probably already love the series. And having it on DVD is great - especially compared to watching the watered-down version on broadcast TV.My only complaint is how grainy the images are, at least through the first season or two. I know this is probably how it was shot, and not the fault of the DVDs, but it is still annoying. Not enough to not recommend the discs, but be aware of this before you buy."
3,GIFT FOR GAL PAL...,"CONSISTING OF 18 DISCS FOR SIX SEASONS OF SHOWS AND TWO MORE ""EXTRAS""This COLLECTORS SERIES of discs takes awhile to go through. Several discs would not play correctly as they blocked [season 6 part 1 - episode 11 and part 2 - episode 8] and we are still going thru the rest...it will take a long time. I am told the COLLECTOR SERIES GIFTset is no longer available, but amazon.com when contacted offered a full refund for return, or to work with me on obtaining selected replacements from the individual season sets, with some refund credit on original purchase. We chose the latter. I have made 20 purchases in the past 5 years total of over $1,200+ and this is the first time I have dealt with customer service or had a problem so my hat is off to amazon.com for the amazing job they do in getting it right or making it right almost all the time..."
1,Bad CD quality,"I got the CDs with a little delay. Some of the CDs play well, others skip, and some episodes cannot be viewed. I am on the 3rd series and I did not watch all episodes. Hope going further I will be able to watch them. So far quality is 50/50."
1,Defective discs... again!,"As many others have stated, some of the discs WILL NOT WORK! I have tried purchasing this set numerous times hoping to get a functional complete series, to no avail. My wife is terribly dissapointed as this was to be a birthday gift. I guess we will have to wait for the Blu-Ray version and hope the discs are functional.Sex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset) [DVD] (2005)"
1,Damaged Product,This was the only product that I was not satisfied with from Amazon. The second disc of Season 2 skipped. Then I ordered another one and the same thing happened!!! I was so annoyed. I wish they would pull these from inventory so no one else has to go thru the hassle of all this.
3,Disappointed,"I was impressed with the price and how fast the product arrived, but was very disappointed in the quality of the disks. There are several episodes that I wasn't able to watch due to the disk freezing up in the middle of the episode. I thought that when you bought something New it was suppose to work. Well this one didn't I would say out of all the episodes abt 6 were defective. Very upset about this product."
2,Not that great....,The box was in good shape but some of the disks skip.... If it starts off skipping then I have to just forget about watching the episode all together.
2,Not happy,I am a huge satc fan but almost every disc is scratched. Totally not worth the money it was a waste and totally disappointing.
5,Perfect!!!!,"I bought this for my fience and she loves it! She had all the seasons separately in the clear plastic and they fell apart and got scratched. This set she truly loves with the bonus content and they all have a great storage for the disc and good pictures too. It's a must for any Sex and the City fan. Now I'm stuck watching it lol, but I like it."
5,best ever,"This is one of the best series every! So glad it was at a price I couldn't refuse! And BTW, I love the sexy pink velvet. some people were complianing about the packaging (scratches etc) but I take a little care and so far so good. Love this set!!"
5,SATC... I want more more!,"I finished watching all of of these with my wife just a few weeks now, yes we watched both movies, and I miss it all ready. I'm just so thrilled she has a great version to watch over & over."
1,Sex and the City became Planet Earth,I ordered Sex and The City and received Planet Earth. I have been hospitalized and when I got home yesterday and got ready to watch Sex and the City I was most shocked to get Planet Earth. I wrote to the suppliers but have not had a response.
4,French Subtitles,I am so happy about my purchase.I just go through season 1. During two of the episodes....there was a flash of SUBTITLES in French...thought it was so strange.Could there have been a copying problem?Haven't seen the other discs to know if it happened to the others as well.....
3,Love the series but these discs are glitchy,"This series is great, however the pink-case production of them is glitchy. Some discs will skip or there is one episode that will not play at all. I have read other reviews with the same problems. I would recommend buying, Sex and the City the Complete Collection as opposed to this, the complete series. It will cost a little more, but there won't be any problems with the discs."
1,very disappointed regret buy this!,poor quality not all episodes work and mostly all of them skip and some don't even come on! im very disappointed and regret wasting money on this!i feel like i've been robbed
4,Sex and the City- The Complete Series Review,"Overall, the product I received was in good condition. It was in its original packaging, however there were a few skips and malfunctions on one of the season three disks. I do feel as though I got this collector's giftset for a great price and in close to perfect condition."
1,"Unreliable seller, Package never arrived","The seller was unresponsive to my email & this is a recurrence among other buyers. He uses USPS and if it doesn't ship on time (or at all, in my case), he blames it on the mail carrier. I suggested that he use an alternative company based on my experience & the reviews that he received. I ordered this a month ago & it's been over a month without a response. I suggest paying with a credit card & having a buffer where you would be able to obtain a refund. I would be open to writing an honest response if he takes the time to look into this issue and resolve it in a fair manner."
1,great!!!!!,it would have been even better if i would have recieved it.... been over a month since i ordered it... would have been nice if i actually got my order!!
1,horrible experience,"this was a horrible experience for me, i tried to purchase this box set for a christmas gift and never received it. I tried to contact the seller with no feed back from him. The money was taken out of my account and I have nothing to show for it. I am now in the process of figuring out how to either get my product or my money back."
1,lets just forget it ever happened,"What a horrific show. Four messed up, neurotic victims of modern society justifying themselves through bad comedy, and a similar existence for millions of women who sit around feeling miserable about themselves, eating chocolate and gaining solace through false identification with these ridiculous characters. The writers bear no small amount of responsibility for allowing the world's womenfolk to drift further and further down a ghastly path of promiscuous, unstable, self-gratifying misery. Still, credit where credit's due - they have managed to create the four least attractive female characters in TV history - an achievement of sorts, I suppose..."
1,the grandmothers of the desperate housewives,never liked this series it was horrible thank god this was cancelled but the saga's not finished they're making a movie boo!
1,Disgusted,What garbage. What a bunch of vanity. A series about sexually immorality - what are people thinking when they watch and buy this stuff.
2,Poor product quality,"The product arrived quickly. The price was good and Amazon always does a good job expediting. The product looks nice, but several of the discs have flaws. There are several episodes cannot be viewed."
2,Sex and the City - complete series giftset,"We had to exchange for a second set. The problem is that the dvd's are just slid into cardboard sleeves rather than being protected with hard plastic. So there are a lot of scratches, some bad enough to make the dvd unplayable. Same problem with the second set. I would recommend the series, and the Collector's Giftset idea is great, but because of poor packaging, I can only give 2 stars. NOTE: Amazon was terrific about replacing the defective item. We decided not to try for a third set since the problem seems to be due to packaging."
2,CHRISTMAS GIFT,I RECEIVED THE COLLECTORS GIFT SET IN PLENTY OF TIME FOR MY DAUGHTERS CHRISTMAS GIFT. I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO HERE FROM HER THAT SEVERAL OF THE DVD'S WERE SCRATCHED.
1,A slap in the face to fans of the show.,"I just bought this box set from Best Buy for my girlfriend, and I've had to return it TWICE!!! Most of the DVDs were severely scratched right out of the box, and wouldn't play on my DVD player. The Best Buy employee went through 4 box sets on the shelf, and all of them were scratched. HBO has basically put out an incredibly shoddy product. Even if you love Sex and the City, DO NOT buy this set! You will regret it. Hopefully, HBO will have the good sense to issue a recall one of these days. In the meantime, I'm considering never buying an HBO product again."
3,"Great show, poor quality","I received this set as a Christmas gift and of course was thrilled. However, I noticed several glitches in some discs and later read other online reviews stating similar problems. To my disappointment, the entire disc 2 of season 3 will not play along with many episodes in other seasons. Although the packaging and other features are wonderful, what good is this collector's set if the episodes won't even play?I think it is highly unfair to continue marketing and selling this product if there are known errors reported. I may as well have bought all the seasons separately. Now I'll end up losing money if I return it and I wouldn't even feel right re-selling it to someone else."
1,DVD bad quality,"as some reviews mentioned, the price is not cheapi heard a lot about how wonderful this show is/was and decided to get the whole package - expecting to enjoy itfirst, the delivery was delayed due to whatever reason, but i am appreciative to receive it in the endwhen i played the first DVD from season 1 ep 1-3 was great, i enjoyed the showhowever from season 1 ep4-6 onwards, DVD has problems, making the viewing unpleasanti have not played all the DVDs but expect more DVD to be faultyfor close to $200, HBO is providing very bad quality"
2,sex in the city complete series,"This was obviously a complete set of all the episodes. All those that played well were fine, however 3 or 4 of the discs would not play properly and so you miss out on segments of a program or would have to skip a program. That was disappointing, given the price."
5,Happy Wife Happy Life,"Men - This has to be the second or worse show ever created unless you are homosexual (Which is okay too). The fashion and the inner thoughts of a woman, well that about says it all.But the upside - Sex in the City is good for well your sex life. Buy it for the honey and you might get some."
2,Some of the disks don't play at all....,and I have been unable to get an answer if those disks can be replaced.This is not a rating about the series - of course only fans would buy the set to watch - but the quality of the product is not what one would expect.
5,GREAT DEAL!!!!!!!!!!,I'm 100% happy with my DVD'sSex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)
1,Returned DVDs,I needed to return the DVDs. I only played a few and they were defective. I don't understand why this product can't be perfected?
3,"The product, not the series","It is always amazing to me how poorly a pilot episode is filmed compared to the rest of them. Watching these brought back memories of mine and instilled a distinct craving for Comos!While there is no doubt that I absolutely love SitC, I unfortunately encountered some problems with the discs themselves. While the company was quick to reply they seemed hesitant to want to replace anything."
5,Increible y muy entretenida serie,"MAgnifica serie. EL paquete el bellisimo y viene con un cd extra, además de todas las temporadas. Es el perfecto regalo para los amantes de la serie, y también para todas aquellas mujeres y hombres que están cansados de series llenas de diálogos insipidos y repetitivos.Totalmente recomendable para los amantes de la buena t.v."
4,Got it as a gift,"got it as a gift for a friend of mine for her birthday because she loves the show, i was worried about some of the dvds not working as some of the other reviewers had described but she said they all have worked for her so far! only concern is that the dvds ARE in fact very tight in the casing. but over all, wasnt let down."
2,"Great Collection, poor quality","The Series Collection we bought is great...but the DVD's are not of a good quality. It doesn't matter the player we use (DVD, Blu ray, Xbox, portable DVD, etc.), we can seldom watch the entire episode because it gets frozen and doesn't even let us take the DVD out of the player!!! We are really disappointed. We can't return it because shipping would be very expensive...so, we have to imagine the end of some episodes or read about it in the internet!!! :( :( :(Just wanted to let you know about this problem so a better care is taken about QUALITY."
1,ALL SETS ARE DEFECTIVE - DO NOT PURCHASE,"Like everyone else who has given this set 1 or 2 stars, we have concluded that the DVDs are defective. We bought one set and noticed that many of the episodes skipped or simply didn't play (particularly in season 3 - just like the other reviewers). After getting the same result when we tried to play it in other players, we returned it to amazon for a replacement set. When the replacement set arrived, we encountered the exact same problem! We thought we were crazy until we read the other reviews on this site. For whatever reason, these sets have a major manufacturing defect & you should avoid them entirely."
2,defective disc,"All of the discs work well except for one which is Season 6 Part One episode 12. Does not play at all. It goes back to menu. I was kind of disappointed because that was one of my favorite episodes where Charlotte was expecting and had a miscarriage and how she dealt with the situation, etc. My advice is to watch all the episodes within the 30 day period so you can return it. I made a mistake on taking my time that it elapsed and cannot return it. I may have to purchase this episode to download it so I can be able to watch it. Bummer!!!"
2,disappointed,"Many of the third disc of a season won't play! Other disc play just fine, so I'm missing the season endings of all the seasons I've watched so far."
1,Scratched Discs,"A warning to anyone thinking about buying the Collector's Giftset. I purchased it through Amazon and two of the discs could not be viewed because the discs were damaged. I returned it and received a refund. Subsequently, I purchased the set through Costco and, again, there was at least one disc that could not be viewed. I returned that set as well and got a refund.To anyone considering the purchase of this giftset, I recommend that you keep your receipt and check each disc (by playing it)so that you can return it if you get one or more bad discs. For anyone giving this set as a gift, I would let the receipient know of the potential problem so that they can exchange it."
1,Not worth it!,Disc's were scratched~skipped & didn't play in the 2 (TWO) different sets I recieved. Amazon was great about refunding full purchace price. Waste of time!
1,Quality Issues for Sex In the City: The Complete Series,"I would suggest that you save your money and do not waste your time with this compillation...the quality control of this box set is very poor!!! After recieving the 2nd box set with the same issues, returned it for full credit. Make sure if you do get this that you immediately check all disks for proper playing.Kudos to Amazon for taking this back and re-imbursing my shipping expenses but would suggest if you really want to buy this get it from a Big-Box Store where it can be more easily returned at point of sale if not free of defects."
1,Skips,On every single DVD it has a split second skip in the intro of the show. Several episodes will not play when you select play.
1,Junk,This was a Christmas gift and I felt terrible having to have the buyer return not one but two sets. Both of the sets had visible defects on some of the discs. The discs that appeared to be ok skipped. The plastic on the first set was horribly scratched and cracked. The quality is awful. I would never recommend this to anyone. Pure junk.
1,Defective,"I bought this for my wife as a wedding gift. Unfortunately, upon reaching the third season onward, the discs began skipping and became pretty much unwatchable. Returned and only got partial credit because of Amazon's 30-day return policy."
5,Fantastic Gift,"Purchased this for my mom, she's a huge SATC fan! She absolutly adored the packaging. Great buy."
3,ok,great series but mine didn't work. had to send it back for a refund. bought at Target for the same price and it worked just fine
4,OKAY... BUT,The item came before it was promised but was not packaged well. It should have been put in a box as it was a heavy item. It was just packaged in an envelope and the casing for the cd's was bent in some places.
1,Even more disappointed,"Well I've just opened up my replacement set and as luck would have it the same exact disc is freezing up. Season 3, Disc 2. Right at the end where Carrie thinks she's lost Aidan's dog. So much for my idea to try to get a complete set by combining discs from the original and the replacement. I have until the end of the month to return the first set so I'm going to watch what I can and return both."
1,Disappointed,"I am asking myself...""I thought I ordered a new product?"" On the first play, several of the DVD's skipped or had static across the screen. I still need to contact the distributor and hope for the best. I have ordered many DVDs from Amazon, this is the first time I have been disappointed."
5,Sex In The City Complete Set,"I got this as a gift from my parents for Christmas and honestly, i barely left the house because i was addicted. The case is really nice and when you open it up it has the CDs and it briefly summarizes what happens in each episode. Definately buy!!!"
2,DVD's dont play!,"I have been waiting for this and finally received it. Ok but I am on my replacement set that ALSO wont play. I am frustrated and disappointed. So now what, do I buy each season individually???!"
1,"HEY, HBO: FAHGETTABOUDIT!!!!!!!","HEY YA, HEY YA, HEY YA! STEP RIGHT UP SUCKAS AND BUY YA FAVORITE SHOW ALL OVER AGAIN! ANYTHING NEW? HARDLY. SAME STUFF - BUT DIFFERENT - AND PRETTY! - PACKAGING! Looks like this is getting to be a trend. You can damn well expect the same thing for The Sopranos and any other favorite television program you've bought in good faith when it came out as an individual season. There's no reason to pick this up unless you're a masochist. I WOULD buy it if commentaries were available for every episode, but you know that's not going to happen."
3,Sounds like Kayla is jealous to me.,"Opinions are like....well you know and after reading a certain someones less then stellar review of this show, it just made me want to purchase this box set even more for my Fiancee. She goes on to, badly, rate several other movies like Pretty woman. And she complains about several others as well. Seems like someone is jealous or maybe its just the fact these films are above her intelligence level. I am willing to bet she is a holier then thou type and probably the type of person to yell at a person for spanking their child in public. Thanks for selling me on this box set with your *yaawwwnnn* review. And lady if you think thats what all New Yorkers and the city of NY is like, maybe you should leave your house once in a while. But as the saying goes, Let those who are without sin cast the first stone."
1,I am pretty angry,"the show sex and the city is a wonderful show. But I am really pissed off that HBO didn't come out with this beautiful giftset until I already bought the cheap plastic crap, for all the seasons. Also if amazon.com is suppose to be cheaper then why is it when I went to TARGET they have the exact new giftset for $189.00 I suggest that you should get the box set but you should buy it from Target."
3,Too pricy on Amazon,"Product is good, but can get it cheaper elsewhere. I returned it and bought it at a big discount store. This is one of the few times I didn't get a better deal at Amazon."
1,"DVDs are good, but Amazon service is not","One of the DVDs in the box set I purchased does not function properly. I have been waiting for over a month to send it back to Amazon. I have requested a return envelope twice. It still has not arrived. So, I highly recommend buying the product from someone other than Amazon. At least then it will be easy to return should you also have problem."
4,a 'mr big' absolutely,love be able to watch the show whenever you want..many of the bonus features are great..hearing the director's background on the show was wonderful..the cut scenes from the some of the show was fun and enlighting..the only part i did not like were some of the bonus features required to much reading..would have preferred audiothumbs up for the complete series..
1,Ripped off,"I took a risk and purchased a used series, and when it came (2 weeks of waiting), it was obvious that it was not in its original packaging. The pages of the book had been photocopied and some were even put in upside down. Several of the disks skip or don't work at all. I will never purchase anything from this person again."
1,not happy,"been a month since i ordered ""sex in the city"" and the arivaldate of 9-23-10 has come and gone. beginning to think ive beenhad!"
2,?????,"Not happy with this AT ALL!!HUGE Sex and the City Fan!!Was so excited to get the entire series, BUTThe first season, AT EACH EPISODE, I had to turn the closed caption off!! EVERY TIME!! Very irritating.Season two - not bad. Had to turn off the closed caption every time I inserted a new disc. I can handle that.The next seasons, you COULDN'T TURN THE CLOSED CAPTIONING OFF!!!!!!! VERY IRRITATING!! GAVE ME A HEADACHE!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!Last season, had to turn off the closed caption each episode. By the time I was done with the series, I don't think I will EVER watch it again!!!!!!!!"
5,Sex and the City - The Complete Series (Collectors Giftset),I bought this as a gift and the recipient was thrilled. It was shipped on time with no problems.
2,Not happy with the product.,"I was eagerly waiting for this set to arrive, cause always thought amazon products were the best. But these Cd's are far from good. I think they are used ones. Every episode gets stuck and I have to Stop resume and start the whole thing again."
1,Skipping DVD's,The first season was fine but the second season all the dvd's skip!!!!! I have tried them in more than one dvd player and the dvd's skip! So disappointing!
3,Sex and The City (6 episode set),Received on time. Qualty was gritty. A couple of the discs did not work. Vendor said I had to go through Amazon. Amazon has never responded.
5,Very Satisfied!,"Recieved this product very prompt. I have always loved the SATC series, but this collector's giftset is AMAZING!Has cute pictures, description of every episode, Even bonus CD! The box is in pink velvet, really nice to display! I am very satisfied with the product."
5,A wonderful time,I had only watched some episodes of Sex and the city but never the whole seasons. I really enjoyed the complete series. I would advise it to anyone who like to laugh and is romantic.
1,Not too happy,Not too happy with this one. Half of the DVDs wouldn't play the episodes!! So I missed out on soo much! I had to fill in the blanks by watching the next episode (if that one would even play)
2,All discs skip!,Should have read reviews before purchase. All the discs I've tried to watch skip at different times.Extremely poor quality-
2,A duplicate disc with season 6 part two disc 2,The series was good. The only problem is that the same disc from season 6 part two disc 2 I had two of them and was missing season 6 part one disc 2 so I had to go back on amazon and purchase season 6 part one disc 2 to watch the four episodes that were missing from the seller I bought it from. It was dissapointing and the disc does not match the collectors series set with the color of the disc I had to purchase separately from another seller.
4,Love the series. Hate the way item was packaged,"I am a Sex and the City fanatic! Love...LOVE the show! I find myself popping in Sex and the City to play in the background when I want something on but don't necessarily have to pay attention. This series has been hard to duplicate since it ended airing.I actually purchased this gift set some time ago but had to comment on how the packaged product affects the quality of the discs. At first look, the item is pretty stylish. A book binder full of discs. Unfortunately, the discs are held in place with paper slots which scratch the surface of the cds. I'm annoyed because one of my discs skips now. If anyone knows where I can go to exchange that disc, please share :)"
1,Do NOT buy this set,I just bought the set new and so far I have had nothing but problems with the dvds. The quality is very poor. I can't watch Season 2 Disc 3 and now I can't watch Season 3 Disc 3.
4,Sex and the City box Set DVD,"I love the show, love the DVD.It is so cool, to watch all the shows in ORDER. The way they were meant to be viewed.The only problem I have with this DVD box set is. My last Disc on Season was scratched. So I have ONE EPOSIDE on the set that is scratched. You can not watch it all the way through.I sent off for another one and the replaced my scratched one, but then the DVD box set they sent me back was scratched as well, the Same DISC.So I don't know if ALL OF THE SEASON TWO'S ARE SCRATCHED OR NOT, But both of mine were.Other than that one disc, it is great.Everyone who is a Major Sex and the City fan should get it.Just watch out for Season Two."
1,worst movie ever,"this is the worst movie in the world any man could watch, guys if your thinking of watching this with a gf dont its torture."
5,"Thank You, Amazon!","I awoke on Christmas day to find perhaps the greatest gift imaginable, a poster with a picture of this set and ""Preordered From Amazon, Coming Soon!"" written beneath it. This is so cool. At first I wasn't interested in this show, but after watching only three episodes, I was hooked. I began watching the show on TBS, and although it was still enjoyable, the editing and poor dubbing irked me, so I asked for this, never thinking I'd get it, but guess what, I will! It comes out in two days, and it's gonna be my best gift ever! Thank you, Amazon, this set is great and the price is WAY cheaper than buying them all separately (which would cost about 300 bucks). I can't wait to get this set, and I'll review it's contents as soon as my sister and I finish watching it. I'm SO excited!"
1,Don't trust Amazon.com for a good quality,"Almost all the DVDs were scratched pretty badly. I sent the set back explaining the problem and asking them to inspect the DVDs before they send me a replacement. Well, they didn't becuase the replacement I received was just as bad -all scratched."
5,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:","GREAT DVD SET, CARRIE AND THE GIRLS SURVIVE IN MAMHATTEN AND THE DATING LIFE OF MANHATTENITES. JM"
5,I will keep this forever!,"A must-have for Sex and the City lovers. It includes Bonus Discs and pages after pages of pictures and tidbits, not-to-mention the pink and fuzzy cover... what more could one ask for?"
1,Poor quality of discs,"Apparently there was a problem wherever these discs were manufactured, because I, like many other shoppers on here, have had to return my set due to malfunctioning Season 3.Which basically means that, if you order this set, you need to watch every disc in its entirety within the 30-day return window."
1,Major Design Flaw!!,"NOTE: This product only gets 1 star because of it's design flaw, not because of the series itself.Warning to all buyers, the jackets that the DVD's are placed in will scratch the DVD. You have to be extra careful when you're removing and replacing the DVD's into the jackets. I have to admit, the packaging is enticing and being a big fan of the show I HAD TO HAVE IT. But i'm so disappointed in the product itself. Bummer"
1,great looking but discs are defective,"I bought this set when it was the goldbox special. I was so happy to finally own the whole set before the movie came out. After reading the reviews of bad disc I decided to watch some tonight. I could not even get the first disc out! It was glued to the paper! After removing it I attempted to clean the glue with a disc cloth, it did not matter. The disc will not play and skips. I tried the next disc which was also defective on the back, glue and marked, and it would not play. I did not even make it passed the first page which is the two discs. This is a great looking set but quality is very poor. If you want to look at the box this is for you. If you want to watch the discs, buyers beware! Not even 12 mins. and it is still skipping all over terrible quality! I am returning these and will not be asking for an exchange due to the fact other buyers have the same problem. Sad, it was a great deal."
1,Substandard Packaging,"What the description for this box set doesn't tell you is that it is half again as tall and half again as wide as a standard DVD, so it won't even fit on the same shelf as the rest of your DVDs. And as nice as the suede album cover might look, inside it's just a ring binder with cheap cardboard DVD holders. Definitely not the high quality boxed set I was looking forward to. And I really was looking forward to having a decent box set of Sex and the City, since the individual season DVDs had such flimsy plastic cases (very prone to ripping at the edges if you open them at all frequently).Now I'm kicking myself for having sold my individual DVDs to buy this boxed set. Maybe in another few years they'll come out with a box set in which they do *not* skimp on the packaging. SatC is the only series I've seen that has such consistently shoddy packaging. I really don't understand why."
4,Sex in the City,The price for this was excellent. I compared in the US and in Canada for the best deal and this was it. Unfortunatly the clear case was damaged during shipping and I am not sure how to get another one. If anyone was information on how to do this please let me know.
1,disappointing with the dvd quality,"This dvd is what I am waiting for... But the quality of this DVD is so bad that I had to exchange it once. The second time I received this set and found there's more problem in the DVD, I contacted Amazon, and they told me that this set has a high return rate due to it's quality.I guess what you pay is what you get."
2,Defects are common,"I went through 3 of these and they were all defective. Season 3 disc 2 would not play on any set. I just sent the 3rd back and bought each season individually. I was VERY disappointed because the packaging is beautiful. I love the box! I really wish it had worked. HBO was no help at all when I contacted them about it. Amazon, of course was extremely helpful and nice but they did not want to send out a 4th box and I don't blame them!"
1,3rd & 4th Season DO NOT PLAY!!!,"Its been said before. And like the others, I don't blame Amazon. They did everything they could, sent a new (but defective) set over night air. Refunded my money when neither played, and I was well past the 30 day period.But I'm highly dissapointed! I saved up to get this set, and was looking so forward to owning it. Now, I say, don't buy it. And write to HBO demanding a product that works!!"
3,"Brilliant TV (5 stars+), But Poor Video Quality, Few Extras","This is really more a review of the DVDs than the show itself. Without a doubt, Sex and the City is some of the best adult TV ever produced -- so well written and acted (except, perhaps, for Season 5, which is only so-so by comparison). Sex and the City is 5 stars + insightful, meaningful entertainment.That said, the video quality of the first couple of seasons is rather poor (like a cheap VHS-->DVD transfer). Very grainy. Hardly any significant extras come with the DVDs. Maybe this is what one gets when the whole series goes for just $200 (one of the most amazing bargains around).If you are concerned about video quality, I might wait until a better reissue."
5,Worth Every Penny,I was so excited to see this set but I never thought I'd actually buy it. I did and I am so glad. I long ago gave up my HBO subscription (but will likely renew when Soprano's comes back in March); I thought the only way I'd ever see these shows again was on TNT where so much is edited out it's like a different show. Save your pennies and ask for Amazon gift certificates for your birthday - this is totally worth it.
5,GREAT BUY A+++++++,"For $109, this is a great deal. It looks like the exact same copy I saw at Target and Borders for $$199. I didn't care even if this didn't came with the free movie ticket. It is a complete set encased in a pink suede album. It is very elegant and it truly represents Sex and the City. I can not express my joy for buying this just in time. I can't say it is worth it for $199 but it is a steal for $109!"
4,A Great Set for a Great Show,"This show is one of my all time favorites! The packaging on this set is so pretty and gives the show the display it requires. Unfortunately, like other reviewers a disc in season three was messed up. Luckily for me, only one episode wouldn't play compared to the multiple episodes other buyers can't get to play. Other than that, it was well worth my money!!"
4,Very good,"I've bought it for a friend of mine who, like me, loves Sex and the City, she's very happy with it, loves the photos and the informations she found in it."
1,Very disappointed with quality,"Some of the disks ""stall"" if you will and some episode won't play at all. Not a lot of them, but none of them should. Whomever created these discs and sold them should have to go good for them! Don't buy this collection!"
4,SEX AND THE CITY GIFT SET,"If you don't have any of the individual season sets of this show, you're definitely going to want this set ! The box and binder it comes in are really nice. I highly recommend this dvd set if you are a fan of the show."
1,"Not one, but TWO non-functioning sets","Apparently there is a serious quality control issue with the manufacture of these discs, because I had to return my first set when disc 3 of Season 2 caused both DVD devices in my house to freeze (I nearly had to break one of them to get the disc out). Just received the replacement set today, and same issue. This is EXTREMELY frustrating, and all I can say it is a really good thing I have not had to pay for any of the shipping!"
5,Great Box Set!,I highly recommend buying the complete series boxset over each season individually. The packaging for the series is beautiful. It also includes an extra disc not included in any of the dvd sets
5,A Review For All Cycles,"Just as life has clearly defined cycles, so does a small business enterprise and the SBA book by Charles H.Green depicts it clearly. Whether it's the start-up or expansion cycle, his book will show you how to plan for the loan, how to go through the document review, and how to enjoy the award of a loan. It walks you through the long and frightening process of getting a loan with sound advice and forms that inform and educate.What if turned down? It shows the applicant why it happened and how to repair any damages to their business' ego. It very smartly says, ""it's not personal it's business.""As antrepreneur dealing with capital formation on a regular basis, I recommend this book to all who know the trials and tribulations of ""getting the money."" You will find an answer to your situation, guaranteed."
3,International Marketing Terpstra,A prescribed text book for MBA students. Unfortunately I found it somewhat lacking in depth and had to resort to others.
3,Good,"Even thought this book was not in color, the content is all there. and the book was in good condition"
4,Handy Coat Hanger,This backseat coat hanger is an excellent way to keep your coat hanger ready. It is very sturdy and it keeps your coat from blocking your view as you drive. I highly recommend this product if you are in and out of your car and want to keep your coat looking good between sales calls.
4,Best gift for your bf or husband,"I bought this for my boyfriend who wears a suit every day. He gets compliments on this product all the time, from co-workers to the workers at the carwash. Everyone thinks it's such a great idea. It looks pretty sharp too. The only issue is if your headrest doesn't come off. That's the only way you can get the hanger on."
2,Plastic Parts Always Break,"Don't understand why they can't make the whole thing metal, as the plastic grey hinge pieces have already broken for me. Anyone know if they sell these pieces separately?"
1,Buyer Beware,"The description doesn't tell you that this won't work if you have electric controlled headrests. The picture doesn't depict it clearly either. I've been trying for several days to get in touch with this seller asking if there is a workaround or adapter, but I've yet to get a reply.Overall, the quality is good but I can't speak to the fit & finish and I certainly won't rate the customer service as good."
2,Blue Screen of Death,"When the product works it works well. However, anyone with Adaptec Easy CD creater 3.5 or above (and possibly below) had better watch out. If you don't download a patch from Adaptec b/f installing the imagemate, then your computer may not boot and you will get the blue fatal exception screen starting with the code 0028.The tech support for Sandisk actually asked me if I got the ""blue screen of death."" They think it is a joke there, but a customer wasting hours fixing a computer with Dell is no joke.Also, my computer only recognizes the device half the time. Tech support told me just to plug it in again everytime I use it instead of leaving it attached. UNACCEPTABLE SOLUTION. I'm returning mine."
2,disappointing read,"I must agree with the other reviewers who found the book a tough go. The actual narrative of the plot itself takes up very little of the book. The majority of the text deals with the complex interweave of family politics in Renaissance Italy, but much of it seems tangential. Engrossing it certainly is not. It's too bad, as I had high hopes for the book. I wonder if some of the other reviewers actually read the same book that I had."
2,this book drops the ball,"This historical era is so much more exhilerating, complex, and intriguing than this book conveys. Martines has politcal axes to grind, and it's obvious. He diminishes the story's excitement (and it's truth).I wish someone would write a great LORENZO novel! Why isn't there one out there?"
3,"Chatty, But Not a First","This was an entertaining spin through Medici politics but is not for someone new to the topic. Background knowledge of the major families, papal politics, and Florentine society is necessary."
2,OK if you're not interested in the medici,"This book is about everyone BUT the Medici. Has lots of info (especially on money value fluctuations) but disorganized, chopped up and, unfortunately, they made even the Medici dull. Hard to do, or so I thought. Try another author on the topic."
4,A good read,"Having very little knowledge of Renaissance Italy, I found this book to be very informative. Not only does Matines do an excellent job presenting the facts surrounding the ""Pazzi Conspiracy"", but he takes time to elaborate on 'Social Climbers', arranged marriages, crime and punishment, and many other topics surrounding the Renaissance.Of particular help were the family trees in the beginning of the book. Without them I could never have kept track of all of the characters. Too many Cosimos, Jacopos and Lorenzos...I do agree with the reviewer who said that the book was a little chopped up, and I feel Martines might have been able to organize it a little better, but this didn't prevent me from finishing it in 2 days.This book helps to make learning about history fun."
4,Murder and Revenge,"The ""rule"" of Lorenzo ""the Magnificent"" Medici in Florence was always fraught with danger. He was not a king or a high elected official, but he effectively controlled the city during his lifetime. This book details just one of the plots against him, and the one that came the closest to killing him and changing the government of the city. It failed, but Lorenzo's brother was murdered, and the revenge taken against the plotters and their helpers and members of their families was brutal indeed, even by the standards of a much more brutal age. The book is riveting when it talks of the plot and its aftermath, but there are long stretches about Renaissance banking and such that are just mind-numbing. These stretches are what kept me from giving this work 5 stars. Otherwise, it is an excellent read, and I recommend it!"
5,A better dust mask.,I bought this model dust mask for the extra protection it offers for organic vapor. I have used these before they seal perfectly around the face.
4,Fumar!,"Nacho-cheese Doritos with an expensive glass of red-wine. Hippy beads in the doorway with a hand-made oriental rug on the floor. ""Chico and the man"" with a soundtrack by Puccini. Spyglass has something for everybody."
4,MR. HIMES IS WRONG!,Keelaghan is great! Now I'll agree he's no Gordon Lightfoot. But then who is? I've seen him in concert and found him to be a very entertaining and sincere musician. I listen to his music on a regular basis. Perhaps he's not the most profound or innovative folk singer but whoever is looking for that in folk music probably doesn't understand folkmusic!Perhaps James use to beat-up on Mr. Himes on the playground....?Now that would make a song I'd want to listen to over and over again!
4,"Not perfect, but still pretty good","While I think the Amazon reviewer has a point about the song ""A Recent Future,"" the fact remains that when James Keelaghan is ""on,"" he's absolutely amazing. And his voice is phenomenal. I especially love the tracks Sweetgrass Moon and Cold Missouri Waters. When he performed Sweetgrass Moon at the Kent State Folk Festival in 1998 asking the audience to provide harmony, everyone practically levitated cause the effect was so beautiful. Give his music a try and definitely see him live if you can!"
2,REASONS FOR DISSATISFACTION,"THE PLAYER WAS TOO HARD TO OPEN. THE RED LEVERS ON THE RED BACKGROUND WERE TOO HARD TO DISTINGUISH.I RETURNED THE PRODUCT ON 2/12/13. I COULD NOT ACCESS THE INTERNET BECAUSE I WAS WITHOUT POWER FOR 5 DAYS. THEREFORE, I COULD NOT FILL OUT THE E FORMS NEEDED TO RETURN THE PRODUCT."
4,Gothic and gracious,"This is another of Tabor's signature blends of traditionals and today's folk. Her arrangements as usual are so sparse as to almost seem austere, highlighting her smoky contralto. ""Ten Thousand Miles"" and ""Let no Man Steal Your Thyme"" are wonderful covers of traditionals. In addition, Tabor makes work from today's composers her own: Billy Bragg's ""Rumors of War"" speaks evocatively of today's world. Elvis Costello's ""All this Useless Beauty"" seems written for her.While this is not my favorite Tabor CD, it's definitely worth a listen and purchase. You will not regret hearing her sing!"
3,Its ok,"In an America ravaged by a racial civil war four people will come together to save the world.1. An old indian medican man2. A street child living in St. Louis3. A homeless man living an an Atlanta ravaged by war and divided into waring sectors4. Most importantly there is a doctor who has discovered a may for the body to heal itself.So ok at the begining when the backgroud is explianed I found that to be very good and well thought out. After that things get a little messy. I love Reading Rainbow, but as far as being a good author Mr. Burton falls flat. My biggest problem is that the charecters repeat themselves saying past comments agian and agian. Not that I didn't like the bookOverall-If you can find it, this is a very good read"
2,A SO_SO BOOK THAT DOESN'T LIVE UP TO IT'S POTENTIAL,I read AFTERMATH by LEVAR BURTON and although he gives it a good try I found my mind wandering while I was reading the book and here's why. I felt that the charachters were just too uninteresting they didn't grab my attention like they should to make a good story although I was intrigued by some of the book's points such as the earthquake and the civil war I felt that it could'nt compensate for the above. So all in all I can not recommend AFTERMATH.
2,Didn't like it!,"Let me preface by saying that I really like Levar Burton. His work on Star Trek and Reading Rainbow is great. I love to watch him act.BUT! Levar should spend some more time practicing before he publishes any more books.Levar has an *excellent* idea with this book. He is a very creative individual, but his writing is too choppy and plain. I was unable to relate to the characters, and topics were introduced to quickly.If this book had been several hundred pages longer, I would have been able to read the whole thing, as it would have necessitated more descriptive language and more attention to detail.Burton should not give up hope. His ideas are fascinating, just presented without enough detail and character development.I will buy one of Burton's books in a few years, because I believe that writing experience will improve his style. Possibly you will see a rave review from me for a future Levar Burton novel."
3,Burton is solid in debut effort,"Although LeVar Burton is best known for his work on Star Trek: The Next Generation, Roots, and Reading Rainbow, I have a feeling he'll also make a name for himself in the genre of science fiction...Although it has quite a few kinks, Aftermath is a thought-provoking what-if that reads easily and engagingly...Burton notes that he wants to leave his own mark on the sci-fi genre, and he does so here...Though not a blow-you-away novel, he does get the point across with an up-tempo plot and believable characters...For a first novel, this isn't bad..."
4,"Excellent extension of the ""Star Trek"" series. . .",Mr. Burton's first attempt at entering into the science fiction genre brings a forceful new dimension to science fiction with this powerful and sometimes even disturbing new novel
1,Fool's gold in the pot at the end of the Reading Rainbow,"Evidently, in the real aftermath all of the truly talented writers have perished. This book was painful to read, to the point my penance for once again allowing myself to be mesmerized by name recognition was to finish it at any peril. I can only hope the target audience is the age group most likely to be familiar with Mr. Burton's work on the PBS show.The storyline, set in the not too distant future under internal conditions of civil war, economic collapse, and impending natural disaster was promising. Unfortunately, the text was presented in as primordial of fashion as I can recall for any work of Science Fiction. Character development was minimal, the science largely contrived, and the flow unpleasant to follow.On the other hand, Octavia Butler, to whom the book was dedicated, would probably be an actor of only elementary skill."
1,This book should be read by every aspiring Author!,"For this book is proof that anything can be published! Whenever I am in need of inspiration I just read the end of this book and remember somebody actually got paid for this! As far as the Author is concerned: I like Mr. Burton! He has entertained me for years... Roots, Star Trek, (Also in the Movie with Steve McQueen who plays a Modern Day Bounty Hunter) and I am not saying he cannot write! But this book just does not pass the test. Pace is ok, Characters thin, but the Plot is contrived and the reader feels it while reading!"
2,Definitely a first effort,"Some of the ideas in this book are promising, but it just doesn't read all that well. The characters are one-dimensional, despite rather forced attempts to give them some depth. There is far too much use of passive voice, and the narrative is choppy. By the time I was 1/3 through the book, I could see pretty clearly all the way to the end. To be fair, there were some high spots. All in all, though, I was glad that I got this one from the library."
3,Horribly structured,"A book that starts of with good potential branches off into a pitifull ill-thought idea. Racist complains about Amercia, which are totally not true. More effort could have been put into the story to make just a little unique. Unless you have no life what-so-ever do not waste your money on this book."
2,"OK, but not great.....","The premise of a near-future America devastated by civil war, economic depression and a monster New Madrid fault earthquake forms an interesting and initially promising backdrop. But Burton's neophyte writing skills are painfully evident in the one-dimensionality of his characters, the amateurish approach to the scientific, and awkward prose. I can't help but wonder what someone like David Brin, John Barnes or Octavia Butler would have done with this story. Another thing I didn't like too much were the almost-cartoonish racist overtones applied to the characters and overall story line. Maybe if Burton would have been less proccupied with these and more mindful of writing a more coherent story, the book would have been better."
5,274 pages- minuscule manuscript relevant to humanity today,"I picked up ""Aftermath"" in the morning and could not put it down. I finished feeling that it is Mr. Burton, not the character in the book who is ahead of his time. Anyone wanting the benefits of the ""neuro"" -enhancer"" need only look inside themselves-- after they read ""Aftermath.""...again"
3,"Mildly entertaining, but lacking true substance.","Aftermath is an OK attempt at Post-Apocalypse fiction set early in the next century after a devastating second Civil War.Science fiction of this type has it's own genre, inhabited by both hardcore SF writers like Niven and Pournell and by mainstream horror writers like king and McCammeron.Levar Burton's first attempt in the day-after-doomsday realm is not bad. His characters need more development (unbelievably wholesome) and seem to be blessed with incredible good fortune in a devasted world full of peril. There always seems to be a good samaritan around whenever you need one.Half way throgh the story you have no doubt that good will triumph, and a happy ending is inevitable.All in all not a bad freshman effort, and I will read Burton again (Levar, if you see this, a tale set during the race war would be cool!)."
2,Disappointing,"I think that Levar Burton had a good theme to build on. He was trying to say that we should correct the schism between the races, which is a wonderful endeavor. However, times it came out a little too much against ""the white man"" and that disappointed me.I don't think the book was too badly written, although there was one page where a paragraph was almost word for word repeated in the one below it, but it didn't really capture my attention or my sympathy. I kept reading hoping it would get better, but it really didn't."
2,Novel with potential fails to deliver.,"I must admit that I purchased this novel because it was written by Levar Burton. This, I believe, was what his publisher was hoping. The novel has some interesting concepts, but much of the action hinges on the existance of a fantasy- like healing device which was not believably realised. The protaganists are pleasant enough, but seem devised to provide racial harmony at the expense of realistic characterisation. Much would have been helped by judicious editing (Is it believable that a scientist who works to develop an electrical device wouldn't know whether 200,000 volts would be fatal?). I doubt that Mr. Burton would have had this effort published without the strength of his name, which is a pity because it is a good attempt which does show some promise. It just isn't ready yet."
4,Funnier than the original,"With new troubles, new misfits, new surprises, and a new member of the Desperadas, it's good to say that Desperadas 2 is quite possibly the funniest Pinoy chick flick comedy I ever saw."
4,La Belle Ville,"Outrageous as the Belle Ville that it portrays, City Unique is much more than a thoroughly-researched and extremely well-written account of two of the most exciting decades ever lived by Montreal: it is also a literary testimony that brings to life the past behind the city's present and future. Weintraub's book flows just like the Saint-Lawrence - you glance at its troubled-though-delightful waters and wonder what you'd find at the bottom... Well, here's your chance to take that to shore, from the accounts of characters as memorable as Lili St. Cyr to the unravelling of a city torn in half by a street called The Main, whose every corner tells a million stories, with anglos on one side, francos on the other, and everything else in between. By one of Montreal's finest journalists, City Unique is an absolute must in our quest to understanding what lies underneath the city's cosmopolitan and multi-cultural enchantment today, as belle now as it was then."
2,learning a new language,"Originally, I thought the interactive format of this product would facilitate my learning Mongolian. However, there is no English transliteration. Also, the speakers' pronuciation is not that clear."
1,Good containers.,"1 Star review was before I saw the case of 6 under features. They are excellent containers. Good enough for AB, good enough for me."
3,getting better,"I'm not a big fan of Miss Zukas but as she's getting older, she's getting better. If she ever gets around to letting Boy Cat shred the draperies, I think I'll really like her!"
3,Serial Killers 101...except for Manson,"I also agree with John Faye. Ted Bundy. Edmund Kemper or another Serial Killer would have made this Video set a must. As explained by Mr Faye, Charles Manson was a mastermind for mass murder, but not, by any means, a serial killer.But the information and research is a must for people seeking basic information on serial murders. The quality is decent. If you are an experienced collector in the subject, you may want to skip it...alot of the info is already in your criminology library at home.If you are also interested in Manson, then this collection is for you. The video regarding him was informative.It's a shame they don't make almost any videos or books on Edmund Kemper...a most intriguing Serial Killer..."
4,This doesn't have an angled rack...other Calphalons better,"This is a great deal on clearance, half the price of what I saw recently at Macy's. However, this particular model is missing two important features.First of all, the rack sits flat in the bottom. Second, the rack has handles along the long edges. Meanwhile, the roaster handles are of course on the short sides. The four handles combine to ""lock in"" a fixed space -- you can't have bird that's legs hang over the pan for example. Newer roaster models I have seen that are optimized for turkeys and birds have a three angle ""cradle"" rack, which I think would be much more functional.Overall, this is a great deal, and I'm sure it'll work well for pork and beef roasts, etc. And we did fit a 20lb turkey in the pan (in a bag) without the rack, so it's not all bad. But, it could be better. The nonstick is very nice, cleanup was a snap."
4,Good for the price,"Used this the other day for the first time. Very easy clean-up. Not the quality I expected from Calphalon. Add says hard anodized, not quite, outside is, but the inside is coated with a non-stick coating. I got the impression from the add the entire pan was hard anodized. However it's a good roasting pan and worth the money IMO."
4,Great roaster for the price,"Like all Calphalon pans, this roaster is of good quality. Have not used it yet but not disappointed as of yet."
2,river work,"i was not happy with this one..i used it once, made chex mix withe it and gave it to my mother for christmas as i had saved the box.."
1,Lightweight & Flimsy,Just received pan - very disappointed. Lightweight and flimsy - not up to Calphalon standards. Will return. Avoid this pan & purchase a better one!
2,L is more like an XL,the mountain's shirt sizes are not accurate but their artwork is amazing. 8 more words required to post this review
5,THE authoritative resource for information about stuttering,"Everything you want to know about the history of research, theory, and treatment of stuttering is contained in this book. I have used it (and its predecessors) as textbooks in my course, as a reference in my own research, and as a resource just about any time somebody asks me ""has anybody ever studied...?"" If it's been written about, it's in the Handbook. This is truly an indispensable text and it should be on the shelf of every speech-language pathologist who evaluates or treats individuals who stutter."
3,purchased for class,This item was purchased for a college level class. The book is full of studies and in depth research and information on stuttering. It is very dense at times.
1,Keep your sales receipt.,"(purchased from a regional hardware chain, ACE-affiliated)This product carries only the flexible flyer name and decal eagle.It has no durability in my experience.I weigh 180#, and this thing tore itself apart the first time I yanked the yoke hard-right. It just folded under me. No crash, no ice.It just folded, as if made of foil, or sun-bleached plastic.Not: ""It failed because I ran with it and bellied-down for a faster run.""Not: ""It broke because I ran into a tree/other sledder.""Just failure, in the softest of user modes.Not worthy of the name some of us remember from youth.Brittle crap."
3,flyer,bought this for my son. the sled is extremely light weight. and i was pretty disappointment in the quality of its workmanship. it works well on groomed trails. i don't recommend it for adults or children over 100 lbs.
2,A view of crypto-zoology,"A very interesting book to read. It seems to suggest that most of the creatures discussed do not and never did exist exactly as described. Unfiortunately, the author constantly tries to ""cover his back"" by suggesting as a parting shot in each case that PERHAPS the creature did exist at some time but does not now, nor are any remains available. to me, it seems to be science tinged with mythology and no clear distinction. In some cases, this degenerates into mere superstition. I certainly would not recommend this book for children or young adults who lack the experience or scientific knowlege to assess this material in its true light."
5,Memory Lane,"I have been a Knight Rider Fan since the beginning, I really don't play with Kitt, I have it on my dresser next to my Rocky Balboa statue. I am 56 years old, I am very happy with this replica of 1983 Knight Rider KITT diecast model car 1:18 scale die cast by Ertl If your a Fan you will to"
2,don't bother,"my wife and i put this on our registry and the both times we used it, it was a huge let down.the first time didn't get hot enough. and the second time it did get hot enough be we had to down the cheese as fast as possible. Even with how fast we consumed the cheese fondue, it wasn't fast enough because there was a good 1/4 inch of burnt cheese at the bottom. spend the little bit extra to get a good one."
4,Olympic Peninsula thriller is very readable,"Based in Sequim, Wa which is where I live, this thriller was a must-read once I heard about it. A good story with descriptions of the local community made the book seemingly come to life.I have heard that the new hotel being built in Sequim is looking to turn this book into a dinner theatre show which would be wonderful."
3,A pretty good book,"This book is a good book for somebody who lives around where it was written, because I thought that some things that were described are not the way it really is, as far as the, "" Rain Forest."" The description of what it is like to be in the woods was really good and the only way the author could describe it was to actually experience it. I thought this book was good for keeping you on your toes, and I was always thinking, and guessing. If you were to read this book and you have never been to the rain forest you would probably know how to dress. There was this specific part in the book that was describing what it is like to be lost in the woods and the way the author described it, it was almost like you were there."
4,A Really Good Read!,"I have never read any of this series of books before, and this was my introduction to Gideon Oliver. I found that at times I was tired of all the silly romance, but it was a believable romantic story of an older man trying to get back into the dating scene. I did enjoy the main story of the ""lost tribe"" and the side story of Bigfoot. I was able to laugh at his attempts to find the people without having the proper gear or skills to go into a rainforest. He was armed with his naivete and silly ideas about ""communicating"" with them. All-in-all, I enjoyed the storyline and I enjoy the idea of someone actually living off-grid in a rainforest and surviving."
4,ANTHROPOLOGIST FINDS MYSTERY IN THE RAIN FOREST,"Fans of Aaron Elkin's Anthropological detective, Gideon Oliver, will find this a necessary sequence in the life, loves and mysteries of our hero. As to his life, apparently he has shed the women of earlier volumes and is ready for something to come along as he follows his physical anthropological bent out in the field. There he meets a Lady Park Ranger, boss of the national park to which he has been called by his friend in the FBI anad finds her more attractive than a cave full of old bones. The reasons he has received the call to consult are a few bones which might throw light on the mystery of a missing girl. Oliver performs analytic miracles but in some loose talk during a press conference gives the impression that the death might be the work of the monster, Big Foot.This sets him and the Lady Park Ranger on a mission to find the truth of the affair.Not the bet of the series, nevertheless, an eminently readable entry."
5,Attention getter from the start,"My mother Geneva was born in Marshall County, Boaz, Alabama. She has never liked to read books, but she was given an autographed copy of Behold this Dreamer for Christmas. The moment she opened this book she was hooked! She would discuss the characters at every meal and in the evening as if they were part of the family! She has constantly asked us if the second book has come out and we found Through a Glass, Darkly. She read this in 3 days! This from someone who disliked to read! She is now asking when the third series is coming out--can you help?! Thank you for such a wonderfully engrossing book, it has brought back a lot of memories for her--she, by the way, is 76."
2,Not quite deep,"I'm addicted to A&E and History Channel's investigative reports, and even thou this one gives a lot of information, it was not as deep as I expected. It doesn't have any performances appart from the intervewed persons. It becomes really dull after presenting one classic painting after another. I'm living abroad and wanted to have some of the same programming I had at home, but this definetely doesn't do it."
5,Mysteries of the Bible: Very well done,I have always been a big fan of this Mysteries of the Bible series with Richard Kiley and Jean Simmons since it used to air on A&E. I am very happy they made these available on DVD. The series is very well done.
2,"NOT RELIABLE, BIASED...","Yuck! It would be so nice to see a balanced perspective. It's not apparent in any of the series out there on cable tv that they even try to get other opinions. This one especially. I trust and believe the Bible is accurate. This series does not. Buy ""The Stones Cry Out"" DVD from World of the Bible Ministries and ""The Second Great Battle of Jericho"" by The Associates for Biblical Research. Then you will get another perspective.Haven't those in the media ever heard of The Near East Archaeological Society, The Associates for Biblical Research, The Institute for Biblical Archaeology, World of the Bible Ministries? Here is a list people that unfortunately many in the media forget about.Dr. Bryant WoodDr. Edwin Yamauchi (infrequent guest)Dr. Gary ByersDr. Bob Smith (from Florida)Dr. Charles AlingDr. Clyde BillingtonDr. Michael WiseDr. William SheaMr. Gordon FranzDr Randall Price etc;"
4,So glad I bought this,"I've used this product 4 times since Thanksgiving, and I've been completely satisified with the outcome each time. It's so easy to clean, and nothing sticks. I love the removable rack, which makes my life easier when removing food from the pan. It's durable, looks good and performs better than I had hoped for. I'd recommed this item to anyone I knew who wants cooking and clean up after roasts, hams, tender loins, etc. easier."
2,Please do not write this kind of books!,"What does the writer want to say to us?No fun, No serious, No meaning, No understanding.Seriously, have Columbia university students read this book?"
4,allright,as a player of the sport of hockey i allways need to practice my shot. These targets are great for that. You can use them again and again. and because they are also so inexpencive how can you go wrong?.
4,Adequate and Fun for Kids,"If you've ever watched the NHL All-Star Skills Competition, you've seen the pros destroy these types of targets with wrist shots. While these are not the same as the styrofoam targets the NHLers shoot at, these are fun for kids and work reasonably well. As the saying goes, if you aim at nothing, that's what you'll hit."
5,Definitely a puzzler!,"It's not often that I haven't guessed the criminal half-way through a Morse book, but this one kept me guessing! Very well written, true to the characters, and well-paced!"
4,Excellent is all i have to say,This is a suberbly written book. Praises to Colin Dexter. The infamous morse and lewis (Morse and Lewis) are portrayed in an excellent and complex characters that you actually start to fell and care about what happens to them. the story is about a murder which happens in Bloxham Drive and morse and lewis investigate it . it leads up to a story of blackmailing and a local election at Lonsdale College for the new master. The book is well written with short paragraphs that made it easier to read and understand and the beautiful plot twists that i enjoyed thouroghly. I would like to ounce again praise Colin for a job well done and this is the first inspector morse book ive read and im hoping to read others in the futre.
1,A disgrace to the Wrestlemania legend.,"I remember when this event was hyped with matches like the ""Fatal four-way"" WWF World Title match. Unfortunately, hype can be very deceitful. You know you have problems when the abominible Terri-Kat ""Cat Fight"" is the only one-on-one match. Almost every match is poor except for The ""Triangle Ladder Match"" and ""Triple Threat Match"". The actual main event was a flop, with people selling longer than they should have just so the Mcmahons could divert the action away from the wrestlers. Mick Foley and the Big show's presence in that match was clearly just for appearance's sake. Most other matches are forgettable. The one great match was the Ladder Match, but it still wasn't the Shawn Michaels-Razor Ramon Ladder Match, nor did it save Wrestlemania 2000. Go look for another PPV. This isn't worth it."
3,So-So,"This PPV was alright, the Triple Threat Match and Triangle Ladder Matches were incredible, and the fatal four way was so-so, but,by far, the best part about this DVD...the history! You can watch highlights of all the Wrestlemanias. See Hulk slam Andre, the Mega-Powers collide, Ultimate Warrior wins title, the incredible first ladder match, and HBK's boyhood dreams come true! This is great history, for a fan interested in the past, and a long time fan...again, the event wasn't incredible, but the history is!"
2,Total FLOP!,"The anticipation of this event was phenominal but once i read the card, i thought it was gonna be a flop. About 3 of the 9 matches actually had stories behind them, why is D'Lo/Godfather fighting Bossman/Bull Buchanen, i thought this match was ok for a bossman match but why was this match on the card along with about 4 others. It did have some good matches like the Triangle Ladder Match and the Main Event but to see HHH, the WWF's biggest heel to walk out of WMania the champ was wrong. This is the 1st WM where the heel walks out champ and it spoilt the event. Mick Foley or the Rock should have won the title, more ratings and sales would be produced if one of those guys won. In my opinion, hardcore WWf fans buy it, but if you just wanna see some action, buy the Rumble, more action and better storylines."
1,terrible wrestlemania,"this video is not worth buyin. i just bought it to have a wresltemania collection. the main event was terrible.the triangle ladder match was awesome though.edge and christian, the dudley boyz and.hardy boyz really put on a show.i reccomend not to buy this movies.i do recommend wrestlemania 12,and any wwf videos from 1996-97."
1,Terrible,"This show was absolutely terrible. The four way Euro/IC match was 3 1/4 stars, the ladder match was 3 stars, Chyna/Too Cool vs. The Radicals was 2 1/2 stars, the main event was 1 star, and the rest were all DUDs. Having 5 DUDs on a card with 9 matches is inexcusable."
1,lineman,"this is the worst wrestlemania ever, and Ive seen all 22, the booking was horrible no Steve Austin apperance, stupid tag matches, head cheeze, mae young, the stupid hardcore battle royal, and the crappy ending at the end of the main event, the only good match tlc was decent at best, but the ones at mania 17, and summer slam were better. This one sucks watch 17 or 19 they are much better"
5,"I'd give this 10,000 stars if I could!","I've been watching wrestling since about late 2001 but really started getting interesting in 2002. I bought the Wrestlemania box set for WM 2000 through WM20, so i don't need the VHS, but I assure you that if you like WWE in it's current state you will love this. It imbodies the attitude era and is very unique and edgy. Its great for fans of any age! It will not be a wate of your money!"
3,shoulduv been better,well it was okay but not as good as i thought it would be. here are the matches and there ratings: bull buchannon and bossman vs.dlo and godfather got a 2 stars. well most of um were duds the tag team title ladder match was good. and the main event kept u on the edge of your seat but a bad and surprising end.
4,WWF Wrestlemania 2000-could it have been better?,To some up Wrestlemania 2000 would be to say that the ppv was shocking and awesome but it wasnt the best.I expected more out of the this ppv due to the way it was hyped.I mean dont get me wrong it was a great ppv but it lacked something......It was great but not the best.I recomend this video though for any new WWF fan.Why?Because in this you will see that Wrestlemania is truly the event where the superstars take it up a noch and the fans cheer just a little louder! Recomended
2,WORST WRESTLEMANIA OF ALL TIME,Wrestlemania 16 was a complete dissapiontment all the matches were rubbish. avoid at all costs. i am a big wwf fan and i know this was dissapointing as a pay per view. the only good matches were The Tag Titles match with Hardys dudleys and E&c and the WWF Title match wasn't all that bad
3,Wrestlemania 16 was Overated,"These people are charging ridiculously a large amount of money for a Wrestlemania, quite honestly was'nt that good... I'm a hardcore fan and at that I've seen way better pay per views that even was'nt a wrestlemania, if your going to buy a wrestlemania get 17 or 18, personally I think 18 surpassed them all and was WWF/WWE's highest peak, it all started going down hill from there... Now That said, DONT BUY IT TIL THEY DROP IT DOWN TO ATLEAST $50.00"
2,Wrestlemania 16 was miserably bad,"WM16 was bad. just too bad. The tag team matches were bad. ALL of them. Then there were the ""many people involved"" matches. The main event, the Triple threat Euro and I-C title matches, the Triple threat ladder match for the tag titles and even the womens match has many people involved. Basically, a lot of suckiness everywhere. The women's match was the only match that was 1 on 1. Kat vs Terri in a ""cat fight"". There was for some reason A LOT of buildup for this match. But obviously, it [is bad]. A few decently good matches were the 2 triple threats and the main event was decent. Altogether though it was bad. Its supposed to be WRESTLEMANIA! Not an extended version of HeAT..Anyway, if u want to rent it just because its wrestlemania, than rent it. but please dont buy it."
2,not that great of a wrestlemania,This was the only wrestlemania I havn't seen on pay-per-view. I have been a wrestling fan for a long time now. Now i've seen bad pay-per-view shows from wwf/e programing. But this has to be among the worst. I found myself fast forwarding to the main event which to me was the most enjoyable match on there. I don't have much to say about the other matches besides BORING.Not my favorite....but hey thats my own opinion and taste. I'm not saying not to buy it all i'm saying i didn't find it enjoyable.
3,ok show,this wrestlemania was just ok. heres my ratings for each match in order.the godfather and d'lo brown vs. bull buchanan- 5/10 **hardcore battle royal- 7.5/10 ***1/2head cheese vs. t&a-; 6/10 **1/2triangle ladder match- 9.5/10 ****3/4kat vs. terri- 3/10 *1/2the radicalz vs. chyna and too cool- 7.5/10 ***1/2chris jericho vs. chris benoit vs. kurt angle- 8/10 ****x-pac and road dogg vs. rikishi and kane- 6/10 **1/2the rock vs. triple h vs. mick foley vs. the big show- 8/10 ****
4,Better Than You Think,"I know a lot of people who weren't too impressed with the show itself, BUT... The DVD presentation makes it all worthwile. I enjoyed it personally, and hearing the alternate commentary during the Euro-Continental match was quite fun. All in all, I really enjoyed Wrestlemania 2000 a whole lot more with the extras.Disc one has the show itself as well as the alternate voiceovers and other things, while Disc two is a great history lesson about the previous 14 Wrestlemanias. With Wrestlemania 20 on the way, it's a great way to bone up on the classics, even if it is four years old, lol. Seriously, it's a great presentation of Wrestlemania, and worth a look."
3,Wrestlemania was nothing special,"Certain matches of the night were great, but outcomes of others were expected. The T&A/Snow and Blackman match was pretty good. The Triangle Ladder match was the best! Unfortunately, the Fatal Four-Way Elimination Match was a little long and weak. Overall, rent it."
5,"If You Are New To June Tabor, Start Here","This was the second June Tabor CD I ever bought, the first being an oldie, Airs and Graces. Whereas the first one was mainly traditional, this one is mostly contemporary. But she gives this material the same loving care that is evident on the older stuff. And if you are new to traditional music or to June, you may want to start here. The songs are some of the most beautiful she has ever recorded - and of course there is her unique voice, which is deep, dark, and rich. Do give this a listen."
5,Great for Coffee Table,"I bought this book because I love Kevin Aucoin and I think that he is an extremely talented make up artist. I keep it on my coffee table but I also look through it for tips for myself. What I have found is that my guest can not help themselves from picking up the book and asking questions about the models. It's like a game, 'Guess who the model really is'. It is striking to them when they find out that Veronica Lake is actually Martha Stewart or that Linda Evangelista is actually a well coiffed man. If you have an open mind and you love make up, pick this one up."
4,face forward,"It is a good book but I do prefer Making Faces,the service was fact and the book was nicely packed. It arrived new invery good conditions. Very happy"
3,Good for pros,"This book is good for the serious make-up artists. It does have a few tips that can be used for everyday use at home, but more geared for pros."
5,professional makeup artist very happy,"I bought both Kevyn Aucoin's books, both are excellent books even for a professional, I have learn a lot more from them than from some courses. Buy them! Gilma Ospino"
5,the master at work.........,"Just from the experts I have read, I can tell you this is an increadable book!! From the pictures, you couldn't tell me winnoa ryder was not liz taylor, or martha sterwert (side note- Proof he is an true artist) is Veronica Lake. BRAVO!!"
5,Great book!,I purchased this book for my daughter-in-law who is in cosmetics and sales and she said it was a great book. She picked up a lot of tips to use in her profession.
5,makeup application books,"I love Kevin's work so much that I have all of his books. I find them very inspiring. I am not a makeup artists, I just like to be reminded that I can do whatever I want with my own face and Kevin's books help me regain my confidence about what beauty is.....it is not about the makeup, it is about who a person is, and what shines through. His application tips have changed the way I make my face. Over the years I rarely have worn makeup because I don't like looking like I am wearing makeup, following Kevin's suggestions and techniques has allowed me to develop the skill to enhance myself in a way that is not glaringly obvious, but a a before and after comparison would yield a tremendous difference. I am grateful for stumbling into finding Kevin's books and now I LOVE wearing my makeup. Putting it on and taking it off has become a small enjoyable ritual for me in a hectic pace of life."
5,Put your best face forward,"Kevyn Aucoin is a brilliant artist, sheer brilliance! His before and after pictures of his models show all the difference of night and day, and although he doesn't give you step by step instructions- it certainly is not a difficult task to figure out from the large pictures included. The book is excuisitly presented, in beautiful hardback and the photographs of the models are well done aswell. I particularly admired Kevyn for using not only celebrities (certainly no shortage either!) but also friends and family of his own, celebrities and other friends. The book probably showcases 70+ DIFFERENT people! Definitly worth the cost- everyone should own this fabulous book. Hats off to Kevyn Aucoin!"
4,A Star Is Born!,"Definately the pinnacle of Kevyn's star-studded career this book is DRIPPING in celebrities from cover to cover! Each super star poses as Kevyn's canvass and boy does he go wild! Highly creative, highly impressive, highly glamorous! The only problem of course being that you would need the face of a celebrity and the talent of Kevyn to pull off most of the looks! But oh well Kevyn showed his own star power in this book before his tragic and too-soon death. He will DEFINATELY be missed by film and fashion elite and by the millions of fans and acolytes he acquired!"
5,Albert Einstein of Makeup,"Pure Genius! Kevyn not only knows how to 'paint a face', but he's also handy with pen and paper. I loved every inch of this book, from the title page to the credits. As with his previous book Making Faces, he outlines each look he makes and simplfies the process so that the non-professional can achieve a similar finish. If you are looking for a book on make-up and application, look no further. You will enjoy it!!!"
5,Makeup has been an art form since the Egyptians,"Celine Dion as Maria Callas? Works for me. Also Kevyn Aucoin gpays homage to his gorgeous mother. This is, afetr all, an artiste who is not afraid to work with Martha! He transformed her into Veronica Lake, and his work presaged that she would metamorphose into the Comeback Queen. I adore this book."
4,Best of Aucoin's books.,"In preparation for doing my own makeup on my wedding day, I sought out various resources, which led me to Kevyn Aucoin's books. While not a self-help manual per se, this book shows the amazing transformations that can come as a result of makeup alone. I found it very useful for providing an overview of different techniques--for example, the effects of combining light/dark mouth with light/dark eyes; the use of neutral versus more dramatic colors; options for shaping brows, eyes, and lips; etc. While most of us will never come anywhere near Kevyn's skill level, this book provides at least a starting point for incorporating some professional tips into your own makeup routine."
3,not descript enough to be helpful,"I wanted to do my make-up like famous african american women, but although Kevin SHOWS in pictures how to thin down the nose, lighten out the skin tone, and other artful concealments, he never mentions these steps in the written descriptions. All the descriptions seem to generally be the same steps, page after page. He is phenomenal in his transformations, but does a poor job explaining EXACTLY how to do them ourselves. The pictures are beautiful, though."
5,Kevyn is a brilliant artist!,"This is the second time I have purchased a book by Kevyn Aucoin. I also purchased (and reviewed ""Making Faces"" which I loved) and I absolutely LOVE him. He is without a doubt the most talented make-up artist in the world. He is amazingly talented and takes make-up to a higher level. It is true art that this man creates. I am astonished and awed every time I see his work. There is so many wonderful and creative ideas that are certainly within the reach of the average woman. BUT, there is also that wonderful element of Fantasy that ""Face Forward"" brings to the table. He is brilliant and I just love his work. It's a wonderful resource and a fabulous coffee-table book. I really think you'll love it."
5,FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE!,"I was VERY happy with the condition of the book and the packaging. Pride of ownership was very much showed. The book was in better condition than it stated, so that was a very nice surprise."
4,This is more a collection item than an actual makeup book,"This book proves once again that Kevin Aucoin was amazing! However, it didn't really help me figure out any new tricks or looks (and I'm not a makeup artist or anything like that). In my opinion it has some content as ""Making Faces"" and a great selection of examples. I do not think it is a bad book or anything like that; the transformations are astonishing. However, I would have just stayed with my copy of ""Making Faces""."
3,"Amazing Artistry but Lacking in ""How To!""","Although Kevin Aucoin is an unaparalleld make-up artist, I was disappointed in the lack of practical hints and techniques for the average person in this coffee table book. Another irritation is the refusal to give name brands for the various foundations, mascaras, blushes, and liptsticks used. The excuse that Kevin gives that, ""they may be out of use in three months"" just doesn't fly. The real reason is based on the $(dollar) sign--Revlon, Chanel, Arden, Estee Lauder et al. may not hire Mr. Aucoin if he recommends one brand over another. This is not helpful to the reader who has no idea what a ""reddish-brown cream blush"" or a ""light beige lipstick"" is.That being said, the make overs of stars and every day people are amazing."
5,Perfect,"Well, he did it again! As a fan of Making Faces, I have been looking forward to this book for a while. Not only are his tips excellent and useful, but the pictures are absolutley beautiful. Kevyn is a make-up guru...who else could have transformed Martha Stuart into Veronica Lake?? Kudos Kevyn!"
5,Kevyn Aucoin is a Talented Artist,"I purchased this book, and what Kevyn can do is so artistic! He has a tremendous talent of bringing out the best qualities on a person and then turn them into other celebraties. My favorite was Cher [the actual one], her makeover was amazing with the jewels around her eyes. I definately would recommend this book."
4,Pulsar Watch Review,I bought it for a gift. I was able to re-set it easily and I like the appearance and the guarantee.
4,Most Realistic Mars Exploration Novel I've Come Across,"Geoffrey Landis does a fine job portraying the dusty, desolate Martian landscape in his first novel, ""Mars Crossing"". Alas it lacks much of the lyricism present in his best Hugo Award-winning short story fiction, but nonetheless, Landis does a fine job recounting a story which could be seen as ""Captain Robert F. Scott on Mars"" (Scott was the ill-fated commander of the British expedition that arrived at the South Pole after the successful visit by fellow explorer Roald Amundsen and his team.). The characters are credible, behaving realistically during a desperate trek across most of Mars. To be frank, the ending is a bit too neat, and disappointing, with a surprising revelation or two by one of the characters. Still, this is the most realistic novel I've come across describing a manned expedition to Mars. Hopefully Landis will fuse some of his lyrical writing with scientific detail in his next novel."
1,Just plain BAD!,"I have tried to read every Mars book to hit the market and I was excited by this new one coming out. Unfortunately, the author only has enough Mars story to fit about 50 pages so he feels the need to alternate chapters between Mars and flashbacks. Not only does this get annoying, but it would seem that every person on this Mars mission had some horridly freakish childhood. Also, Mr. Landis' personal obsession with the cesspool city of Cleveland shows as multiple characters ""coincidentally"" went to college in Cleveland. Anyway, if you want a Mars book pick up the Kim Stanley Robinson or Ben Bova series'... this one is terrible."
2,"If this is ""Hard Science"" then I don't like it","I can't say I enjoyed this book. As is epoused in the sleeve-notes, the writer has a significant amount of real NASA-related experience. I found the book far too reliant upon actual scientific details than having any real story. Page after page of technical-details does not constitute the type of Science-fiction to keep the reader (or me at least) involved. There are no actual mind-bending ideas in this novel, it is simply a modern-day pseudo-thriller padded out with too many references to details like 'UV-energized sulfur radicals'. If you like sci-fi based around unique and previously untried concepts (such as a Philip K Dick novel) I would suggest you will find this book somewhat stale."
5,It was a good reading!,"I had just finished reading the awfull dissapointing shelters of stone (Auel)(by the way do not buy that stupid book of AUel shelters of stone, do not waste your money.) and had no intentions of reading another long, long stupid book, so I grabbed this one and I got into it, caught my attention, and game me the enjoyable time I was looking for. I know nothing about Mars or space travel. so everything was pretty credible for me, as any scfi story, the reader most learn to accept certain things that are humanly impossible as possible So based on that, everything sounded credible to me. I am waiting for the sequel to see what happened with them all on the different paths the choose. Good, entretainig and easy to read."
2,"Okay Science, Bad Fiction","The science (as you might expect) is pretty good, but as fiction this book falls flat. It has no dramatic tension, two-dimensional (at best!) characters, and an ending so abrupt and so lame I almost threw the book at the wall. Spend your money on Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Books instead."
2,Hard sci-fi? Hardly.,"Seriously, how hard is the science in a book that has a blurb about somebody getting lost because he forgot to take his GPS unit into a cave? (Don't believe me? - use the Amazon search function).OK, the science, which is supposed to be the centerpoint here, is now very very suspect, but how is the writing? Not great. Not a bad book, but not great either. The old plotline of ""who will give up their life for the others"" has been done before. Lately, better, by Michael Flynn in ""River of Stars"". There is a lot of babble with not very interesting characters. Hey, if I had to choose between ""Paris Hilton - My life story"" and this book, I'd choose Mars again. But that's not saying much, is it?"
1,One of the worst sci-fi books I've ever read...,"Don't let Geoffrey Landis' claims of being a ""NASA insider"" fool you into thinking that this book is even remotely based on science fact. I AM A NASA INSIDER and I assure you that most of the book is based on complete bunk. The astronauts in this book seem like out-of-control gang-bangers who shrug off death like it happened every day. The reality of WALKING or DRIVING from the southern hemisphere to the north pole of Mars? I think not. Astronauts having sex in the space station? No. And don't even get me started on the ending... It's horrible.Do yourself a favor and read another book. I will never, repeat, never read another book by Landis."
3,Great beach reading,"If it's a page turner you are interested in, this is it. For a first novel, it's pretty good but I'm looking forward to reading Landis' next book.Pros: Totally enjoyable. Lots of interesting classical physics problems to think about. Engaging plot.Cons: No totally new ideas. The characters were not very interesting to me."
3,Good straight forward Mars Book,"After so many disappointing books and movies on Mars, along comes Mars Crossing. This is an interesting problem that places a crew on the surface with a broken space craft, and the only working (or maybe no longer working) space craft is on the other side of the planet. For the first time I really got to see Mars in terms of its geography. I think the characters could have used some more work. They weren't flat or anything, they were just kind of the same. This is a good read with some interesting twists towards the end."
3,Intriguing if imperfect,"As a disclaimer, I should admit to having known Geoff online and at conferences for some years, so I am not completely unbiased.This novel is the author's first full length book, and shows many first-novel flaws. As an engineer and scientist, I was coughing dismay at the lengths gone to set up the primary man-against-nature conflict, though the execution once set up was better than average. There is a focus on the characters which is nice, but inconsistent. Some ring true, some fall flat. Plotting was unsteady in places.That said, this is a book that I enjoyed reading. Geoff is a better than average writer and I am looking forwards to future novels of his. I do not recommend _Mars_Crossing_ without reservation, but I do recommend it."
3,Interesting premise never really catches fire,"Astronauts stranded on Mars trying to find a way home is a potentially exciting premise, but this book a disappointment.Part of the problem is that the characters are not drawn with any depth - the author doesn't get inside them and make them living, breathing people.And Mars is well...boring...as portrayed here.Competently written but it just never catches fire."
4,I can't get enough Mars books!,"As you may have heard, Landis is actually a NASA engineer, so he knows what he's talking about. Everything in the book is technically accurate, and he has a lot of interesting sociological predictions. It is always hard to write near future sci-fi, since everyone has different ideas about how things will turn out.The best part of the book, however, is the characterization. I felt like I really knew every one of the characters after finishing the book. They actually have the quirks and character flaws that all of us carry around.I would recommend this book to anyone, regardless of whether they are Mars fans or not. It will definitely get you thinking. Just be sure to buy it from Amazon through the Mars Society's web site, so you can actually help us get to the Red Planet!"
5,.,If you are looking at this review then DO NOT PASS THIS ALBUM UP! This guy is one of the greatest of all time. You can hear some of his music on mySpace if you want to check him out. His songs will make you laugh and cry. Why are all the great ones dead?
4,One of their best later albums,"This CD has the most traditional tunes of the post-70s Fairport Convention, and I generally prefer more trad. with my Fairport. That being said, it also contains some of my all-time favorite non-traditional Fairport songs (""Slip Jigs & Reels"" and ""Travelling by Steam"" are fantastic). All the musicians are excellent, and I must point out that Simon Nichol's voice is wonderful on this album (really on all the ones he sings on, but I noticed it the most here). I don't know why such a rich voice doesn't get praised more. My only complaint is that there are a number of songs (like ""London Danny"" and ""Diamonds and Gold"") on this album that, while good, are real downers!"
3,A lively example of 90s Fairport,"The quality of Fairport Convention's 90s albums has depended on the material they've found to record. ""Jewel in the Crown"" is a pleasant return to form after the tedious ""The Five Seasons"". The songs are more lively here, giving the album a better pace and more upbeat feel. Highlights are the instrumental ""A Surfeit of Lampreys"", ""Travelling by Steam"", and ""Slip Jigs and Reels""."
2,"Multicultural American Literature: Comparative Black, Native, Latin, and Asian American Fictions","Wordy, bias, book of hate.I do not say things lightly, and yes, I have read it cover to cover. Essentially, whites are evil and everyone is a victim are the two central thesis points.All of the examples point to this idea.The book is very difficult to read, both for its wordiness and its content.Whatever happened to ""I have a dream that we would not judge each other by the color of our skin, but the content of our character."""
1,Not impressed,I had to order this book for a college course I was taking. The book made no sense and subsequently I dropped the course. I've read better material.
3,CD by folksinger who happens to have same name as novelist,"This is not a review but a cautionary note -- obviously Amazon's employees are ignorant of the fact that there are two Cormac McCarthys in the Amazon inventory, one a folksinger, the other a distinguished novelist. If Amazon suggests audio CDs by Cormac McCarthy, the performer in question is not the noted writer. END"
5,Cool jazz,The collaboration of Bob Stata and Justin Flynn is not to be missed. Cool as a summer breeze.
3,Nice tunes!!!,"This is a quality first effort by bassist Stata. He has composed some very nice tunes. He has also called on the composing talents of Gibson and Flynn for several of the cuts. All of the tunes are quality, but some of the arrangements don't come off as extremely thoughtful. That being stated, I found this to be an enjoyable record full of honest performances. It alludes some to the hard bop period, but stays mostly in a 60's Miles kind of groove throughout. All of the sidemen are quality with a few familiar names. (Locke, Grant) It is certainly a refreshing look at jazz music. You will find yourself humming all of the melodies after a couple of spins on the disc player. I really like the front line of vibraphone, saxophone and trombone. Why don't we hear more jazz trombone? This recording certainly begs the question. All in all, this is a great Sunday afternoon listen."
2,Distracting and disappointing,"John Denver was many things to many people, to some a happy camper whose view on the world was Far OUT! While to others Denver was a visionary, someone who inspired others to look more deeply into their values, their world and do something proactive about it. Although MS Smith attempts to explain Mr. Denver's spirituality, the book is more ""her"" take on spirituality than Mr. Denver's. It's also distracting to find out that Ms. Smith never knew Mr. Denver personally so how can she claim to represent his views? After reading it I wondered why I'd wasted my time reading this. Rather than read this book buy more of John Denver's later cds from the 80s onward and discover his spiritual beliefs through his lyrics for yourself."
2,A Mediocre Result with Great Intent,"You'd have to be a pretty dedicated JD fan to like this book. It clearly has positive intent and there's no question the ""Everyman"" approach John Denver took to his own spirituality was appealing to a broad audience. This book just ""misses"" in so many ways that it's a difficult read."
1,A disappointment,"The title of this book is a piece of false advertising. I expected to read a description of the spiritual and religious views and practices of someone whose music I enjoy. Instead, what I got was a 150-page essay on the author's personal new-agey definition of ""love"", sprinkled liberally with hero worship. The book puts John Denver on a pedestal and presents him as a transcendent and perfect being; I prefer to see those I admire as real people, with real human imperfections."
1,It is a CREEPY waste of time and money...........,"This book is more about idol worship then it is about John Denver. I had been looking forward to reading this, but unfortunately from the moment I began I only became more and more disappointed and uncomfortable. The author moves away from the humanness of the artist and focuses on creating a picture of someone that we seem to be expected to worship as a deity rather than appreciate as a humanitarian. John Denver was a committed and conscientious believer in the goodness of the human spirit. I think you will find his philosophy is best represented in the tableau of his own music. Truly, it would seem a much better place to go to understand his spirituality."
1,garbage,"I'm a die hard John Denver fan, so it would be very hard to displease me. This book does. I know much more about JD's philosophy, and I've done no research and only shook his hand a few times....The book is so full of praise you would think this man is Christ....I had to throw up it is so sweet."
1,Better books exist about John Denver...,A disappointing book by someone who never met John Denver or heard him in concert. Miss Smith has rendered only personal opinions.
5,The Almighty Pan!!!,"I'm not the type to get excited over a pan, but I'll make an exception for this pan. Fantastic buy!!! The nonstick is exactly that, nonstick. Cook an egg without oil and the egg glides off - anything you cook glides off. Wash it with soap, water and a washcloth and your done."
2,Not so great,"I decided to return this item because the bottom did not sit flush with the stove and caused the pan to wobble around whenever I tried to use a spatula on it. It's possible that the pan was defective and that everyone else's pan was flat-bottomed, but the cooking was so uneven that I didn't want to keep it. I already have the 10 inch crepe pan, so I'm just going to buy another one. That pan is the best piece of cookware I've ever owned, and the fact that I don't mind having 2 of them is a testament to that."
1,pass on this one,Calphalon has the same cheap non-stick coating that comes off and scratches with the least contact as the cheapest pans you buy at the dollar store. Get something with a thicker coating that will actually last.
1,overall not pleased,"I purchased this pan about a year ago. I remember liking it at first. I had read a lot of great reviews on this product and I have always liked Calphlon. For the first first time I am complaining. The bottom of the pan became warped. I do not use this pan more than a few times a month. My displeasure in the product prompted me to check the customer reviews, which I rely on, to see if other consumers had the same problem.I found one other person with this complaint. The pan does not sit on on the stove making it impossible to cook evenly. Forget the spatula.I will be throwing this pan out soon. This is my first customer review and I have been buying Calphan since 2000.I suggest that you pass on this one.SincerelyThis Pan S...."
3,"simply calphalon low end, but performs great.","Simply Calphalon like the rest of the lines carries a warranty. When there is an issue such as what I've read here, call Calphalon's 800# number, I'm sure they will replace a piece in that condition. Professional cookware, low end or not comes with quality assurance."
1,Day bed,This product was disappointing because there was no spring included by place the matress for the bed. My daughter will have to wait another three weeks for shipment before she can use her bed and I've had to spend an extra $180.
4,My daughter won't stop watching ELMO,This is a good DVD. My 18 month old daughter sings and dances to this video. She will sit and watch it long enough for me to empty and refill the dishwasher...that's all I can ask for!
5,Loved it,I have a little 8 month baby and he just LOVES Elmo. He won't watch anything so intenting as he does Elmo. So we have a huge collection of the Elmo DVDs.
2,Losing Steam,"The series started out great. The first few books were wonderful, but the plot seems to be running out of steam. I'm eagerly awaiting the next book, to see if it is picked up."
3,When is going to end?,This new book disapointed me because Pacal is making this series into a soap opera that will never end. It is taking to long for Sam and Gaia to get together. This is an endless pointless story. And I hate waiting two months for the next book to come out. I will lose interest by then.
4,It's okay,"Not as much problems happen compared to her first couple of books. She longs out the problem with Sam and Gaia too much. But over all it was good. Just good. Nothing better. She didn't get into to much fighting. This one is mainly just about the relationship between Sam and Gaia. But it's not that bad that you should skip it. I'm hoping for a better book next time, but it seems like she is going to run out of stuff now that her dad is sort of together..."
4,"Many recipes, no photographs","If you enjoy spicy, smokey, and grilled...this is the book for you! Many, many recipes mostly grounded in the flavors of the Southwest that feature the building blocks of salsas and grills. We also enjoyed the deserts and beverage recipes....BUT would have appreciated at least a few photographs. The woodblock illustrations with each new chapter are nice, but once you get into this volume you'll need some sticky notes to mark your pages. If this had had some pictures I would have given this book 5 stars!"
5,yay! It's back!,"This is one of the cookbooks lost in Katrina that I'm so happy to have again! Granted, some of the recipes are committed to memory, but it's comforting to be able to curl up on the couch and read like a sneaky romance novel.The canning and sauce recipes are to die for, and everything has smokey hints and spicy influences! One of the favs!"
4,Sizzle Spicy Smackaroo,"Great cookbook! The recipes are easy to understand and even better tasting. Mr. Kerr has a flair for setting the mood for each of his recipes with anecdotal descriptions of how to serve and what to serve with the dish. The only drawback is sometimes the recipes call for ingredients that are not easily obtained (common grocery store), but he warns of that in the book! It's a good read and a great cookbook."
1,Defective Product,"The design and size of the book is very nice. However, if you decide to buy this book, or have already bought the book, then make sure that you count the amount of pockets that are included inside of the book. The back cover of the book claims that there are 13 pockets included for Kindergarten to High School Graduation. The book that I received for my daughter only has 12 pockets. Therefore, it only allows enough pockets for Kindergarten through grade 11. I am very disappointed that I cannot use the book because of this."
3,Difficult to use on oneself.,"This is probably easier to use on someone other than oneself, someone who has long, thick hair.My hair qualifies on two points, it's long and thick. My only problem is trying to manipulate it on myself. It's easier for me to do a French braid on myself than Wonder Weave. It's doable, but I've yet to get it neat. Towards the bottom of the braid, I have trouble holding onto both it and my hair, so the end result looks a little poofy.I really think this could work, if I use it on someone else; and the result where I get it right is lovely. However, I'm not much good at doing my own hair, and I thought this would help. It's not any good for how I want to use it, but it could work for someone doing a daughter's hair.________________UPDATE: I practiced and practiced on myself and I've finally given up. This is just too difficult for me to use on myself."
3,index works but search does not,"It has a lot of content, but buyer beware, there are compatibility problems with the search engine and browser, specifically from the CD:This search engine works with most Java-enabled browsers supporting version Java 1.1.2 or later. It has problems running with Mozilla 0.9 and 1.0 and Netscape 7 on Mac OS 9...Well Mozilla essentially means all of the new Netscape releases also (since its Mozilla based). I don't know what Microsoft-only planet the idiots who wrote the search engine came from, but given the material they should have considered that a bulk of the user base is on Unix and Linux, and DOES NOT USE MS BROWSERS. They should have advertised this fact before hand."
5,Worked wonderful!,My MIL was constantly complaining about her corner cabinet. We installed this in less than 15 minutes and now she is happy! Whew!
3,Pretty tedious,"I am reading through this and I am disappointed how tedious it is to read. It is very detailed but the history gets bogged down in all the details and celtic names the author shares. All good stuff, but stilted. I was hoping it would be a good read in addition to being a history book on druids. It is the latter but not the former."
2,Academic Grudge Match,"I suppose that books are a nicer alternative to MTV's Celebrity Death Match when it's time to settle a score (not half the fun, though.) There is admittedly a huge amount of very academic and erudite information here concerning the Druids and Celtic history but I felt that he wasn't really writing for me. Instead, he was carrying on a running argument with Nora Chadwick, another equally talented writer who happens to differ with Ellis on several apparently key points of Celtic lore. So be it - if Druids are your thing you'll likely find the book interesting though maybe a bit dry and academic. If you're looking for something to read along with your stack of vampire or werewolf comics, though, you'll likely find it long and tiresome."
4,Good Solid Overview of Druid History,"I enjoyed this book- it isn't as ""dry"" as I was expecting for a history book, and actually didn't take me long at all to get through. It covers all the basic bases to introduce to people what the Druids were, at least what we do know about them. The only thing I wished was that the author would have looked into the Druid Revival more if he was going to do a chapter on it. He's obviously treating it with disdain, and because of this only presented some of the less credible people involved in the Druidry revival, or at least barely mentioning the ones that inspire many modern followers. Other than the last chapter, excellent book and a muast-read for those interested in Druidic history!"
3,Be very careful ordering this,"I looked up the model of battery that my UPS needed on APC's website. They stated it was BF250, this item, so I ordered it here at Amazon.Unfortunately, APC believes BF250 is known as RBC33, but the listing for BF250 on Amazon.com is RBC10, which is a slightly different size, has terminals in a different place, and is only one actual battery, not the pair that is RBC33.So, make sure this is really what you want."
2,Depressing,"The other reviews were so great I had to buy this DVD, later to find out I could watch it on ""You Tube"". It is a little bit longer than 4 minutes but if you really need to have it buy it used. The other reviews were so in awe of this but I found it sad and hard to watch."
1,Absolutely Horrid!!,I know Harlequinn Books are a short read (usually takes me 2 days)but this books was just terrible. I won't even keep this on my shelf.
5,"Loves these boots, get compliments all the time.","Beautiful color. Perfect heel size. Comfortable. Can wear with jeans or a skirt. Rugged, high quality leather that has lasted for 5+ years and still look great."
2,Poor,2 of the 3 balls split in the first 15 minutes of play. Good weight and bounce qualities. Maybe these were a bad batch?
4,"A good, basic treatment","As a good, VERY basic biography of the first twelve rulers of Rome this book is good. Grant basically turns Acton's saying about ""power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutley"" into his conclusion that overwork and poor health mixed with a healthy dose of fear will do the job even better. As a historian Grant is first rate and cites all the obvious sources for his subject (Suetonius, Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny etc...) As a writer however, Grant is not as accessible as someone like Joseph Ellis, James Reston or Steven Ambrose. He has a penchant for the more ""scholarly"" style of prose which can often make good information like this a bit less accessible for the general reader. These guys led amazing lives full of intrigue, violence and incredible self-indulgence. A little on how the Roman populace and the Senate viewed these rulers would have given a more well-rounded picture."
2,Back Support,It was not the size that it stated. I really needed it so had to sew on an extra piece of elastic and velcro to make it work. If I didn't live out in the country I would have sent it back. That is why I ordered online to save me gas and a farther trip to find a back support.
2,nothing compare to what is shown in the picture,"No bars .......where are they, it supose to be like the one shown in the pirture, So.."
2,Didn't live up to my expectation,"I suffer from horrible neck pain and headaches and have tried so many different things to get some relief. When I saw this product on Amazon, I was immediately intrigued. It looked like just the thing to allow me to massage my own neck when the pain hit. After receiving the Accu-massage, I immediately tried it out. The little balls at the top screw into the handles and can be adjusted to one of 3 different settings on each side so that you can customize to your needs. I think what most disappointed me was that the balls are stationary. They don't roll around as you move the sticks. The balls are hard rubbery plastic and don't slide easily over the skin so it mostly feels like it's just pinching your neck rather than massaging. It just didn't work for me. If this company could make a similar product with balls which would roll as you massage, I'd definitely give it a try. This one, however, is not something I would recommend."
2,"Possible I'm using it wrong, but it's not doing anything","I basically feel like I bought a weird bendy stick. I've used it a few times and it just doesn't really massage my back. It seem liked a great concept. But now I don't really use it anymore. Like I said it's possible I'm not using it correctly. I think the biggest issue is it's too flexible. When I put some pressure it just bends too much. There's no resistance. Most of my energy is then used to ""shape"" the stick and not actually apply pressure. It's entirely possible that if one was not to press too hard it may work. Problem is if I have a need for a massage, then I need a lot of pressure. I lift weights so it's possible my muscles are denser and need more pressure to get knots and aches out."
1,Not so much,"I thought this would be a good idea but it really just pinches and although the balls adjust, I could never get them so that they actually dug into the right spots. It really was a waste of money and is sitting unused in my closet...along with a few other things I'm purchased. A tennis ball is more effective and a lot cheaper!"
1,Another defective unit broke promptly,"Used twice for a few minutes by a 68 yo 104 lb woman and snapped in half with minimal effort. See all the other reviews on this product reporting the same over quite a long period of time. My son bought the same thing a few weeks ago and it snapped in half the same way within a short time. Fortunately Amazon refunded our money promptly.DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, do not purchase. Read all those ""1"" reviews!"
2,NOT REALLY HELPFUL,I WANTED SOME KIND OF DEVICE TO HELP RELIEVE NECK STRESS AND KNOTS IN THE MUSCLES. THIS PRODUCT JUST DOESN'T DO IT FOR ME. I TRIED IT WITH SEVERAL BAD SPOTS BUT IT DIDN'T RELEASE THE KNOT. AS FAR AS USING IT TO MASSAGE A KNOT OUT OF MY NECK I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
1,"Liked it, but the handle broke right away",I used to have one of the red and black versions of this device and gave it to my daughter. Decided to replace it and ordered this white one because of the price. Guess you get what you pay for. It didn't last long at all. One of the handles broke rendering the entire device useless.
5,Helpful tool,"A little tricky to get the hang of using, but once you master it...it can help you move those painful knots out of your shoulders. It hurts in the process, so make sure you know what you are doing."
1,HORRID SINGER!!! BEWARE!!,"the worst singer i have ever heard- i love prog metal- but i sold this cd after a week- great, great music here- but the singing! Id rather listen to a donkey whaling in my face- or listen to a cd with a bunch of midgets hitting eachother with baseball bats in the groin!!!"
3,Not so impressed :(,"Sadly, I was not as impressed with this album as I was hoping to be. Granted it is Evergrey so it does rock, but it does not hold the epic power and true emotion that I felt ""Recreation Day"" or the far-superior ""In Search of Truth"" captured. The music and lyrics are good but they don't seem to have the hook-line-sinker effect that the other earlier two albums have had on me. Englund definately stands firm as a amazing and powerful vocalist and all of the musicians are at the top of the game. I won't call this album poor or a waste of money by any stretch but definately get ""Recreation Day"" and ""In Search..."" first."
4,EVERGREY AT THEIR BEST...BUT NOT THEIR VERY BEST,"Ok...This Album Is A Great Album Indeed. It's Atmospheric, It's Got That Very Edge That Elevated Them In Their Past But What It Doesnt HAve Is Patrick CArlsson On Drums...Dont Get Me Wrong Jonas Ekdahl Is A Good Drummer But He Does Not Have What Carlsson Had In The Previous Albums.Thats My Only Peeve Of This Album...But All In All It Is A Great One. ""A Touch Of Blessing"" Is A Great Opener...Its Catchy And Has That GOTHENBURG Sound. The Following Songs After Are Well Written But I Know Englund Can Do Better. Its Worth The Money...Buy It..."
2,kevosb,"This was a let down from the previous CDs. There weren't any apparent new ideas. I heard a lot of stuff that sounded like attempts to modify great old ideas. As a musician I have found one of the biggest problems is to do something completely new AFTER doing something completely great. Evergrey has a solid past. This CD sounds labored, struggling, unimaginative and plain. I hope they find a new direction because their last CDs all have unique excellant works. I'll buy the next CD but if its like this I will never give them another chance."
5,AMAZNIG !!!!!,"Loved this cd....... I wasnt all too impressed with a few of the songs but half way through the album, it turns from an average cd to incredible and amazing. Some truely moving and touching songs on this cd. My personal fav is When the Walls Go Down. With the 3 accoustic songs at the end as a bonus, this album moved me in ways no other band can. The vocals are amazing !!!!!!5 STARS"
2,Second rate and too subdued.,"I, like another reviewer, find myself bored with this CD after only a few listens. It seems like one of those ""let's toss together a CD real quick"" projects, with a bunch songs that likely didn't make the cut on Recreation Day. Sometimes it's just better to wait a extra year or two to allow for a more quality product to take form."
3,Well........,"For staters, this along with SDT was my first evergrey record, so im not some long time fan, but i do know what I bloody like. Now, this album was not some slap dash effort like many have claimed it must have been, they spent like 5-6 months in the studio writing and recording this.Now to the album. Its easier to criticise an album like this than to see what songs are actually great. I think 1,2,3 and 6 are possibly the only great songs on this album, More than ever, being possibly one of my favourite songs ever. But there is definatly too much of a mid tempo, samey feel to the tracks, and in all honesty it does get boring. If i could i would prob give it 3.5 out of 5, purely on the brilliance of more than ever, ambassaador and a touch of blessing. But this album sadly has nothing on SDT."
2,I have never liked this band and never will,"When i heard of evergrey with ""a search for truth""i thought hmm this band is different.BUT..the more i listened to the singer the more i realized this guy sounds like a suped up version of Michael Bolton(with his ohh yeahh,baby,this and that).His voice didnt fit this music in the beginning and it doesnt fit now.The music is very good(as most swedish metal acts are).But his voice shoots everything down,songs start out with good riffs,solid drums,bass etc.then he opens his mouth and its like well this sounds like Bruce springsteen.Want some good singers listen to TAD MOROSE,NEVERMORE,DREAM THEATER,BALANCE OF POWER..etc.Sorry no sale here."
5,the more i listen...,the more i like these guys. they are like my second fav band after dream theater
5,Great Taste,We can get these crackers locally but the price is a lot higher. I absolutely love these crackers and they have a deep rich cheese flavor. I will continue to purchase these crackers from Amazon to complement any holiday.
1,Total unsatisfied,"This model RN-305 is a complete disappointment. I purchased it to replace a model RN-108 which unfortunately was dropped and broken. The replacement doesn't even come close to the original. I have tried all settings...speed, voice activated, etc to no avail. The replay of recorded voice is not natural and there is always a continuous whiring or hissing in the background. The similar microcassete it relaced had no such annoyance. Recordings from the old recorder sound ok on the new recorder so obviously the recording properties of this new recorder lacks any quality. Can't even return it due to a 3rd party that hides behind Amazon.com in the wood-work."
1,"OK for a while, then it stops working","I bought this recorder for college. At first it worked pretty good, sound quality isn't great, playback is a little fuzzy and distorted, but overall it was good considering the price. Now after a couple of months it only works when it wants to. It will be fine one day, and then the next it won't play the tape back, or it won't record at all. I thought it was the tape, but it does this with all the tapes. I replaced the batteries so it's not that either. I have lost hours of lectures because of this thing. I am buying a digital recorder to replace this one. Hopefully that will be more reliable and maybe even last me the entire semester!!"
5,"Dated technology? Yes, and it is fine for my purposes","I wanted a recorder to 'catch' my thoughts as I went for a daily walk or drove in the car. I thought I wanted a recorder that uploaded my 'session' onto my PC and also one that was rechargeable. In looking around at the technology, I decided to try this older paradigm. It works fine! It does what I wanted to do - capture thoughts that come to me when I am away from my computer. I like the simplicity of the design and it is working just fine."
1,Great if you like MOTOR NOISE,"I agree with another reviewer. This machine is nothing like the older Panasonic micro's, which produced CLEAR recordings. This one buries your voice behind motor noise and hiss. Am exchanging it for a SONY."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,"JUST WANNA WARN YOU GUYS NOT TO BUY THIS FROM STAY AT HOME DADS. THEY SUCK!!! I ORDERED IT IN DECEMBER 2009, AND NOW ITS JULY 12, 2010 AND IT STILL HASN'T ARRIVED! I WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING IT FROM ROCK RIDGE SALES INC. THEY GET IT TO YOU IN LIKE 3 DAYS! THESE GUYS ARE THE WORST SERVICES I'VE EVER HAD. I CALLED THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NO ANSWER! I EMAILED THEM, AND THEY EMAILED BACK 2 MONTHS LATER SAYING, ""SORRY FOR THE MIX UP, WE'LL REFUND YOU ASAP AND SEND U A NEW DECK FOR FREE."" AND GUESS WHAT, THEY DIDNT. THEY ARE THE MOST UNRELIABLE PEOPLE I'VE EVER BOUGHT FROM. I NEVER THE SECOND DECK THEY PROMISED AND MY MONEY WASN'T REFUNDED!! IF YOURE SMART, U WON'T EVER USE THEM AGAIN"
5,Great Cards,"The red deck is a beautiful deck of cards and has been an effective and novel magic deck. But one element I was not aware of when purchasing was that the cards have a slightly altered red rider back. The outermost white piping is filled in red. While good enough for a cursory glance, it won't hold up under even casual comparison. As for a positive, the red faces make for a very dramatic effect when performing a shape-shifter change to an identical but traditionally colored card, seemingly snapping the color out of the card."
3,A nice little book,"This book apparently is written for the housewife who likes serving pecan nuts or likes baking pecan pies and wants to have some background information. It is very nicely printed, nicely bound and nicely written, with brief easy-to-digest chapters.There is a modest number of recipes, and a modest bit of natural history. Most of the book is on the history of the pecan growing industry, with a select few historical b&w photographs, and plenty of historical tidbits. This book will make a lovely gift.My major criticism is that the pecan tree, as a tree, is almost lost from sight, with only a single color picture of a tree and no picture of leaves or flowers (however, nuts are featured infull color). Also the bit on the botanical name is ... Well, let's say if it was a recipe it would yield an inedible product."
3,smaller than pictured,This item was a little smaller than I thought barely fits in my hand but over all decent blade and had a nice sharp edge
3,A Light and Fun Read,"I had fun reading this book. It had some clever ideas and you could tell that the authors had a good time with it. I thought the physiology of the plant people was particularly thought out; I like it when a fantasy world is that detailed. I didn't really get into any of the characters but the book kept me guessing until the end about what the villain's come-uppance was going to be. A complete surprise! All in all, this was an enjoyable book and I hope to see more collaborations between Anthony and Taeusch in the future."
3,"Light, enjoyable read","To me, this reads as less of a serious novel (Incarnations of Immortality, for example) and more of a light, enjoyable read. It seems that Mr. Anthony and Ms. Treusch got together and decided to have fun. I get the feeling that they just wanted to relax and play around a bit, and it does seem like they had fun. There's a lot of plant puns here. Magazines become 'magazinnias', prostitutes are 'passionflowers' and the like. I smiled at some of the puns. If the author's objectives was to have fun and make a amusing story, they definitely accomplished that.However, the ending felt weird to me. The 'secret' of Spring... well, it's not much of a secret. I was happy for what happened with Zygote at the end, but at the same time, it felt cliched to me. This book had a lot of potential, especially for the ending. I'm not saying that this is a bad book at all, but if you do decide to read it, just don't expect a great read."
3,Cute but sappy,"don't read this book if you're looking to get very involved with the characters! the book is humorous, but it just gets so cutesy you get a little tired of it after a while. a good read if you're on a plane or laying on a beach, but not to get involved with!"
3,It isn't easy being green.,"This book is mildly amusing with its odd cast of characters and plot mixtures. Among other things it contains humans, human/plant hybrids, ant people, good wizards, bad wizards, spaceships, magic castles, time warps, romance, etc. Spring (the human heroine) is a strong protagonist, but Herb is a bit wimpy as the half-human, half-plant hero. Read it just for fun, but don't expect too much. For a really intense read about green people, I recommend MISTWALKER by Denise Lopes Heald."
3,"Intelligent plants, people, and hybrids","An interesting and sometimes humorous novel. Herb Moss and Spring go through a series of adventures as they try to elude an evil magician. The story tends to sidetrack into various fairy tales, and wanders a bit getting to the climax. A kidnapped maiden, dragons, and various ETs all add to the plot. The story becomes a bit corny at points, and gives a plant's eye view of life - those flowers you pick may be someone's children. Overall, it is good light fiction."
3,"Good for a read at the beach, but don't expect too much","Piers Anthony is most known for his comical Xanth books, but in this book he and his collaborator, Jo Anne Taeusch, turns their sites on science-fiction. This is the story of Spring, a girl on the run, and her unlikely hero, Herb Moss - a half-man/half-plant.This is a nice, though light-weight book. The characters are underdeveloped, with the book relying on the zaniness of the happening to carry the story along...which it does only moderately. The mix of sci-fi and fantasy is not too serious, but then again neither is any of the rest of the story.It's not a bad book, good for a read at the beach, or when you have time to kill.(Review of The Secret of Spring by Piers Anthony and Jo Anne Taeusch)"
1,Unreadable bilge,"Its clear from the author's note at the end that Taeusch knew this was the only novel she would ever write. Therefore, she has included EVERY IDEA SHE EVER HAD. It's got puns. It's got plants. It's got magic. It's got space travel. It's got time travel. It's got (failed) attempts at humor and (failed) attempts at profound obsevation about love, romance, and sex. The end result is so utterly incoherent one shudders to think what it must have been like before Anthony polished it up."
4,Learning the Ropes,I should have read this book BEFORE my recent trip on Southwest. I actually saw many of the shennanigans Marty describes with such classy humor. It made me wonder just how many of them he had pulled on me as the middle person to his aisle seat. The book makes flying Southwest more fun.
1,disappointed,just really not that funny. i ordered it to bring my total order up to 25.... should've paid for the shipping.
1,Don't bother - if you're looking for a great ab workout,"I just received the video and couldn't wait to feel my abs burning. What a disappointment! Although the instructor explained each move slowly, when you actually got into it, it seemed to go to slow and not make you feel the burn as in other Ab videos. I would recommend this only if you are a beginner and never worked your abs before. Abs of Steel videos are much more intense and you feel the burn!"
2,Good if you like slow ab work that is easy,"I liked some new moves that htye do on here, but I really don't think this tape is effective over the long run. The ab exercises are very easy and I didn't even feel the burn at any time that I did them. Never was I sore the dare after or anything, it was just plain too easy. I think they needed less talking and explaining of the moves and just do them for longer and a bit faster. Everything was in slow mo!"
3,Decepcionado...,"Saludos! En resumen, compre este CD-SINGLE por el VIDEO ENHANCED de ""ESCAPAR"" que viene en el (si, realmente trae este video), pero lamentablemente es solo para verlo en una pequeña ventana, porque al intentarlo ver en PANTALLA COMPLETA, se distorsiona terriblemente, y es algo lamentable porque el archivo que viene pesa como 80 MBS, yo he comprado CD-SINGLES que venian con videos de tamaño menor, pero con mejor resolución"
2,Great? More like unknown.,"I picked up this book thinking I would be reading about detectives of the likes of Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, and Miss Marple. The back cover lists such literary greats as Agatha Christie, William Faulkner, and Ray Bradbury. But when I read the short story by Agatha Christie, who did it feature? Not Poirot, not Miss Marple, but one George Rowland. Never heard of him, you say? Well, I have read this particular story before, but it's barely memorable. It involves a minor mystery that does not involve a murder. An Agatha Christie story without murder! The editor's poor choice of this short story is indicative of the other types of stories he used to make up this collection. Throughout the book I found one tepid and boring mystery after another. I would definitely recommend borrowing this one before buying."
4,Different,"I enjoyed the storyline very much. It was unique and different from the usual time travel romance novels. I encourage the reader that, if you find yourself scratching your head at the simplistic narrative of the first few chapters, to persevere. The writing vastly improves as the book progresses. This is definitely worth the read."
3,OK,"I was looking for a christmas book for my daughter that would explain things simply, this wasn't it. I mainly decided to purchase because the illustrations are beautiful. The text leaves a lot to be desired! It barely touches on the actual nativity story; it is pretty much just animals in a barn. Nice illustrations, though."
4,very sweet story,Beautiful illustrations and a wonderful way to tell the Christmas story. A couple of pages had some flaws in the printing.
3,Static,"Unimaginative illustrations and scant script. While generally reverent and wholesome, the book is undistinguished. Better to buy The Christmas Donkey or another book with superior, more lively illustrations. 3 stars are generous."
5,The Christmas animals,"Got this one for my grandson, and it is very sweet story of the animals at the manger. He will love the animals."
4,Dreamy Illustrations,"My four year old daughter loves this story. The story is simple and repetitive. It is about animals welcoming one another into the manager on the evening of the birth of Christ. At first I was skeptical that this short story wouldn't hold my very inquisitive 4 year old's attention, but it did and still does! She asks to have the story read and read again. I believe the illustrations are part of the attraction. The images seem to glow and are tranquilly beautiful. The specialness of this night can be felt on each page. If you are looking for a Christmas book that is beautiful to look at and will captivate a young child's heart, look no further. This one is as good as gold."
5,sweet little nativity story,"I really love this book - I love the refrain ""There is always room for a little one here"" and how it ties in to baby Jesus finding a welcome after being rejected elsewhere. A sweet children's Christmas story that does not lose sight of Christ nor become too pedantic."
5,Great Christmas story for youngsters,A wonderful story of the birth of Christ. Perfect for toddlers thru kindergarten. Pictures are beautiful. I read it to my prescool Sunday school class and they loved it.
1,Disappointed,"I have several Case knives and they've all been great. But, I regret buying the Sod Buster. It was dull right out of the box. Even worse, it absolutely would not take an edge. The blade shape isn't very useful. Too fat and not pointed enough. It's more of a glorified paring knife, except my paring knives are sharper."
2,It's okay,"This product is just ""okay"". It brightens up the bathroom and its thin enough that the toilet lid stays up. The new tolilet seat we purchased has a very thick back hinge that does not allow for a traditional lid cover (the reason for searching for something thin like the Seat Sock). However,the opening end frayed VERY quickly and the sock constantly gets twisted and needs to be re-adjusted. I'm not sure I would get this again."
3,They Work.,"Sure wish that they had some plan, calmer colors to choose from, but if you have an elongated toilet seat - they don't make the covers anymore. So, if you want a cover, and some color, these work."
1,Post-modern trash,"If this is what post-modern lit is all about, I'd rather be a pre-classicist. This book is essentially one big chapter about a hundred brothers reuniting for a dinner. What follows is a series of squabbling between brothers that is at most incoherent. The prose is really bad, with exaggerations and flowery words (more like a Venus flytrap). Donald Antrim seems to have written the book in one night, because the events don't make sense. My advice is start with one brother, and go up from there. Leave this bin of mumbo jumbo for graduate students and intellectual snobs. Post-modernism is reserved for you after you're dead."
3,100 Brothers is not better than 4,"What do you do when you can not write in depth about a subject or at least you can not depend on language to carry your work? You write a postmodern mess that carries the reader along on a wild joyride, and leaves the reader in the end with nothing but good entertainment.This work exemplifies tendancies in contemporary fiction to not write literature as much as write anything that mocks it. If you can not write Literature, then take the necessary elements of literature(in this case plot and character) and stretch it to the extreme producing an original but utterly empty postmodern cartoon.I give Mr. Antrim three stars for entertainment. Its a fun book. But not much else is there."
2,Bummer,"I got my 3Com two weeks ago and had a terrible time trying to determine what was wrong with it. Finally, it proved to be a hardware problem. The modem was defective. It seems to be real fast, but two agonizing weeks of trouble shooting is too much since it requires checking both software and hardware."
2,driver problem,"The model number of this modem is USR5699B. It crashs my system (frequently (I have Windows XP Professional, which is a very stable operating system). After each crash the core dump screen shows that one of its driver file has problem (3c1807pd.sys).I bought this modem just becasue it is a US Robotics. My old US Robotics Sportster modem works perfectly for more than 5 years. But I am very disappointed at this one. I did not give it one star becasue this is a very fast modem."
2,I feel like an online crash test dummy,"It is a shame for 3com to be mentioned, but I am also one of many infatuated customers that happen to find the Blue Screen of Death maybe twice a week when navigating with this modem. Could be the hardware which could be a piece of s*^t or maybe the software (system Drivers).My OS and machine are more than enough 1024 KB RAM, P3 Xeon, SCSI disks and windows 2000, Service Pack 4.What could be wrong? My trust in a serious and commited company to deliver something good for life, or the mistake of paying the price for a cheap piece of hardware that delivers pain, in the closest retail store!"
4,"Might not be ""new""","I was happy to find this mike available on Amazon, at a good price. It was listed as ""new,"" but when the carton arrived, the manufacturer's box inside all the packing was completely trashed and faded. It looked like a mouse had eaten half of it. There was no shrink wrapping or sealed plastic anywhere, including inside the box. While this Mike was in good condition, I seriously doubt that it was new.I called the company, who offered to take it back, but had absolutely no explanation about the packaging or history of the item. I opted to keep the mike, but had I known that it was not ""new,"" I would have expected better pricing. Personally, I think Amazon should remind this retailer that there is a difference between ""new"" and ""used, in good condition."" I believe they were being dishonest."
2,Missing Something!,"This book is definitely missing something. Maybe the author tried but does not succeed in connecting all 24 ship disaster stories from centuries at sea. The author, Bernard Edwards, tries but doesn't succeed in making me interested in the sea disaster stories listed here.For starters, he starts telling stories from the 1770s to the 1980s. Remember this book was published in 1990. While I found the Titanic disaster to be the most fascinating, the author writes another side to the story entitled ""Scapegoat"" about Captain Walter Lord on the steamship, California, that was rumored to be nearby while the Titanic sank. I found this case to be most interesting because of my interest in Titanic.Apart from Titanic, the other stories are often short and repetitive in nature. The stories just blend together. I would have preferred to see more connections among the disasters."
1,The title is deceiving.,"What a disappointment. I am preparing for my first trip to Spain. Hoping for a summary of the country's history and people that would help me appreciate what I am about to see, I anxiously opened Lalaguna's book. Instead of text that would bring the country's culture and historical figures to life, I found a mere time line. Chapter after chapter that traces groups of people by date and geographical location. The Black Plague, the Inquisition and Ferdinand and Isabella's reign were all dispensed with in a mere paragraph. What a shame that such a rich heritage could sound so boring."
1,Very Unapproachable...,"A word of caution: this book is not in any way a pleasure to read. I tried several times to slug through it but maybe got as far page 60-something. I don't want to dwell on how scattered this book was. I'm still looking for that great book about Spanish history - or at least a comfortable overview. As for the title, ""A Traveller's History of Spain"" who is the traveller, is it supposed to be the 'reader' or the 'author'? If it is the latter, it must have been a book meant for him because I couldn't follow along. This book is arduous."
2,Biassed history always unwelcome,"While shallow enough for those like me who have little patience for over-scrupulous books, it is strikingly biassed and opinionated. Some remarks about historic figures are blatantly subjective, and bias reaches its zenith when the author goes to great length criticising the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez. As a Spaniard who has lived that period, while I acknowledge the right of the author to hold an opinion on Gonzalez's period in office, his comments go way beyond admissibility in a history book. I cannot recommend this book."
1,book review,The one i purchased was a used book wich fell apart as i read it. I was not worth it the travel folks that recommended it must not have read it.mor historical orientated not a good travel document
4,Great for Beginners!,"This book has lots of useful info. for those interested in Crystals. It gives a brief overview of the science and mystics behind crystals, as well as a brief description of the properties of 20 common crystals. It also has a short section on healing layouts. There are lots of beautiful pictures! However, this book doesn't give a very detailed description of any of the crystals, and is very limited in the amount of information it supplies. A great 'diving board', though."
5,A real life tear jerker. Reads like a novel. I loved it!,"I loved this book. It actually made me cry. I had no idea that Robert Capa had an affair with Ingrid Bergman (among others!) and it is brilliantly told. I have read a few of Alex Kershaw's books and the thing I really love about them is that they tell true stories in an exciting way. They really do read like novels -- rather than the usual stuffy, worthy bios that get written that only an obsessive fan of the subject could be bothered to wade through. Deserves to be made into a movie."
3,"Pretty to look at, not really to cook from","The pictures are great. The recipes are ok, but they fell a little flat. It's not something that I feel I'm going to use a lot."
2,A Little Too Full of Itself,"Written by Hamptons insiders, The Lobster Roll purports to be a charming and useful summer cookbook. And while its size and photos do make it aesthetically appealing, its prose and recipes disappoint. There's not much new here, including the self-congratulatory tone that permeates the glossy pages. Anyone who has visited the Hamptons will recognize the you'll-always-be-an-outsider-compared-to-me attitude; anyone who has ever made crab salad has already advanced beyond this book."
5,Raves for the Lobster Roll,"Our home of 31 years was decimated in the September 2010 flood and everything on the first floor was lost, including this cook book which my husband and I had purchased during a New England vacation a couple of years ago. I was so happy to find it available at Amazon. It's a great book, full of delicious recipes and helpful little hints (even helpful for someone who has been creating in the kitchen forever!)."
5,great tribute,"Spence's originality and passion obviously inspired a lot of musicians--that, and the thought that they could deliver a less harrowing performance! Really, this is the best tribute album I've ever heard (don't they usually stink?), not a bad cut anywhere. Hokey Pokey also did a very nice compilation of Richard Thompson's songs done by others."
2,Buyer BEWARE!!!!,"This is NOT ""silvertip"" badger hair. It is ""silver tip"". That space makes all the difference in the world. This is your basic pure badger hair brush that cost about 25 bucks. The descriptive ""silver tip"" means simply that the tips are silver colored, not the grade i.e. not the indication of quality that the one word ""silvertip"" meanbs. This is a VERY misleading product title and it IS NOT the way Omega itself describes the product. The merchant should be ashamed."
2,Brush Shedding,"I have used this brush for a little over a month. It has now started to shed! Everytime I use it, it looses 4-5 bristles. The brush was great in the beginning, but now given the experience I am having, I would not buy it again."
3,"Great quality, very small print","This is certainly a quality bible, based on the NIV. However, the print is very small. I have the KJV Pitt Minion and though the print is also small it is much more readable. The paper in the KJV seems to be more opaque, but it may be just a bolder print.I will add that the French Morocco leather that they used is nice and the binding allows the bible to lay open flat. This edition also comes with a concordance, which my KJV doesn't have. As always, Cambridge does make the highest quality bibles. Even with the small print, it's a nice Bible. Still, preference should be given for more literal translations such as the KJV, NKJV, NASB, or ESV."
1,False Advertising,It does not fit a 2006 Aveo. This product is for 2007-2011 aveos. I have been burned twice now trying to get a dash kit for my girlfriends car.
1,Bad Choice...Amazon,"Funny you asked me to review this purchase. It was the first thing I ever purchased from Amazon...and it doesn't work! I contacted the manufacturer. We ran a number of test on the product only to find out it was defective. I'm sending it back directly to them. By the way, I have to pay for shipping to send it to them. It would be nice if Amazon offered to pick up that tab. Now I'm not saying this was Amazon's fault it doesn't work, but I will have to say it may be a really long time before I order anything else from you guys.Thanks for asking my opinion."
2,!!BRING SOMETHING BETTER TO THE PLATE!!,"Don't waste your time checking this out. This is truly a horrible buy, take my word. The sound is horrible. It sounds like someone put a metal box around it so you can't hear it well. Plus they charge too much for it. On my part, bring something better please."
5,minna quickfix arms and legs,"excellent tape ,girls really mean business,not just a show girl tape .Use it all the time .If you mean business as far as quicktone workouts ,buy this ,its well worth it"
4,A Friend In Need Is a Pest,"Bobby Heenan was one of the greatest entertainers to ever appear in wrestling, and here in his own words he relates tales from his time in all of the major feds of the day. This is a very quick and easy read, as The Brain moves from one entertaining story to the next. Not much in terms of straight autobiography here, as the flow is mainly in the stories, which Bobby tells very well. Recommended for wrestling fans from the 70's onward, as younger wrestling fans won't have any idea who a lot of the wrestlers that are mentioned are, while longtime fans will love the stories and memories that Bobby The Brain shares."
3,"That's why they call him ""The Brain""","Being a wrestling fan since I was a young boy, I have to say this book is a GREAT READ. However the only down side to this book is it's TOO short, Bobby's been in the business way too long too to write such a short book, even Chyna and Goldberg who've been in only a few years in wrestling wrote their books with more stuff. Bobby I hope you write a follow up with much more stories, other then that I really recomend it, or as The Brain would do, wait for your friend to buy it and take his."
5,a fun read,"bobby heenan is a famous heel manager and heel announcer who has a great sense of humor. Some very funny anecdotes and advice. A great read for anyone who has enjoyed the ""brain"", or pro wrestling."
4,"Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan - WWF/WCW/AWA fans this is a must.","Bobby Heenan was in the the original big three wrestling organizations during each of their peaks. AWA in the early 80's, WWF in the mid 80s to early 90s, and WCW during the late 90s. Throughout the book he details what it was like and several HILARIOUS stories from those days. Among them are stories involving: Ric Flair, Andre The Giant, Harley Race, Vince McMahon, Linda McMahon, Jesse Ventura, BlackJack Lanza, Tony Schiavone, Mike Tenay, Gorilla Monsoon, Verne Gagne, Mean Gene Okerlund, and many more. The Foreward by Hulk Hogan really says alot about The Brain. The only reason this didn't get five stars is because some of the dates and such are off a bit, but for any wrestling fan or any era that had Bobby Heenan in it, which I guess is every era except this current one, should definitely get this book. Of all of the wrestling books that I have read this one is my favorite."
3,brain cramps for heenen,as much as i liked this book it was TOO short...heenen only wrote about 148 pages some of which was the index.. maybe he will write a more in depth book once he beats his cancer...i was very suprised at how he was very close with gorilla monsoon..watching him as a kid i always thought they hated one another but that couldnt be further from the truth..the same can NOT be said for tony shiavone
4,"If you love ""The Brain,"" you'll love the book.","I thought this was a very entertaining book and a quick read. The only problem I had with it was that Bobby talks so highly of Vince McMahon, you'd think he was a saint. Not saying McMahon is all bad, but I think old ""Weasel"" should have been a little more open about how McMahon is. Nonetheless, I would recommend this book to any true wrestling fan."
1,why bobby why,"I read this about a year ago but it terribly unimpressed me. He was an arrogant enjoyable person as a fighter. The book shows very little of that. I read about a person who was down on his luck, no insurance that helped [the toll wrestling takes on his body, cancer in the family], and begging Vince for a bone.Not what i expected. Not what i liked."
1,i love the brain but not his book!,"wrestling fans save your money! i'm a big bobby heenan fan, but just can't recommend this book. it's PONDEROUS to read and other than one or two wisecracks, the brains personality just doesn't show here. doesn't give much detail and you get the impression it was written very quickly."
1,Helen Traubel Rarities On Radio 1937-1944,"This CD sounds like an old, old worn out record. Not quite on the wrong speed - but definitely not on the right speed."
5,The only book you need on bonds and derivatives,"This is a truly impressive work and a great reference. Even market experts will find something of value here, it takes the reader from first principles to some very complex subjects, all explained in very acccessible fashion. Every topic connected with the debt capital markets is covered, ranging from bonds, interest-rate derivatives, money markets, credit derivatives, yield curve analysis, structured products, CDOs, everything. It is also very well written, like having your own private tutor and market expert delivering a lecture on the markets. It is well worth the money I paid for it, and I recommend it to anyone who needs to know about bonds, derivatives and market analysis. This book is streets ahead of all the competition, no author I have come across, in over 20 years of experience in the markets, comes close to writing like Choudhry does. jrasheed2000@yahoo.co.uk"
5,Comprehensive,This book is a valuable resource for all levels of experience with bond markets. I highly reccommned it to anyone in the field or interested in learning about the subject. The book begins with a rather basic introduction to the debt market and leads you into a detailed analysis of derivatives and more complicated pricing models.
1,Done Better Before,This work seems to be a clone of other books that came out earlier but were better written. There is nothing new here.
1,The Market Clearinghouse,"This book has some good information in it, but the problem is that it is not new information and seems highly derivative of earlier works. Those books happen to be chiefly by U.S. authors, but that is probably because the number of financial books written in English tends to be by U.S. writers, although several strong UK writers have made significant contriutions.Whatever the phobic concerns of the reviewer below, there is no conspiracy among book buyers to avoid this author's work. The marketplace voted based on its perception of value-added.It is sad when one cannot tolerate the treatment one is content to mete out to others. The only way to change that is to refrain from doing unto others what one does not want to have done to oneself. Smart people stop negative behaviors and suddenly life becomes much more enjoyable."
4,o,Bought this to replace the original cables. Not great wire or connectors. It gets the job done and that I guess is the bottom line.
5,Great Watch,"This is a highly functional, no-nonsense watch. It is very accurate and has a clear, easily readable illumunated dial, with 12 and 24 hour and five minute interval markings."
4,Good quality watch.,"I have always had the numerals and hands of my watch illuminated. This watch illuminates the entire face, and the hands are seen as a silhouette. I think I perfer the normal method,(illuminated hands and numerals), now that I have used this watch for a month. I will reactivate my Seiko. This Pulsar is a good watch and keeps accurate time, and I am a fan of the twist-o-flex watch bansthat came on this watch, like I have on my Seiko."
5,MENS PULSAR WATCH:,THE WATCH CAME HERE JUST FINE. AND IT FITS JUST RIGHT AND I LIKE IT AT NIGHT WHEN IT DARK OUTSIDE SO I CAN SEE IT FINE AND IT LOOKS GREAT THANKS. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS WATCH THANKS...
4,Shredder meets Expectations,This is a great Shredder for the price. I would have rated it 5 stars if the printer didn't arrive with a crack in the case. The machine does a great job cutting up the paper into very small pieces. It can hold quite a bit of shreddings which you'll find add up quickly. Staples are no problem for this machine. I would buy another one or recommend this to a friend without any hesitation.
5,Cool Hair,"I was getting married and the lady that was supposed to do my hair and makeup backed out two weeks before my wedding. I liked the hairgami products that I have used in the past and needed one more piece to accomplish the look that I wanted. I was thrilled that I could get a kit with the piece that I needed and a few extras to play with later on. I have since watched the little dvd that came with it and tried out a few of the other looks, which take patience but look great once you figure them out. I liked this product and would recommend it to anyone that would like to move beyond scrunchies and ponytails everyday for work."
3,Plastic cheap,"The second day I was using this product one of the handles broke off the tool that creates zig zags in your hair. However, the concept is good. The others products work well and the video is informative."
2,"If you have thick hair, I'd look elsewhere","I wish I had read more reviews before I bought this product. My daughter and I both have very thick long hair, and many of the accessories that came with this would just NOT work with our hair type. The ones that did work broke quickly. The style cards seemed easy to follow, we just had too much hair to do the steps. Perhaps if we had thinner hair it wouldn't have been so abusive on the hair clips that were included, and would have warranted a higher rating. For us though, not so much."
4,Good Value for the price,"purchased through supplier website Not AMAZON. Product is economical for all the clips offered in the makeover kit. It takes a minute to get used to how to use them. They are not your simple clip or elastic band from the drug store. With patience and persistance they become easier to use, and after a bit they are second nature. I recomend this product. They will make your hair look good and people will notice it too."
1,So diasspointed,"First of all, the DVD in it is so old that it will not play on any type of new technology. The instruction booklet is an overview, so that was no help. I had to go to YouTube. I still couldn't get figure out what 1/2 of the items do, and the only one I did like was the monkey claws and they broke with in a month (they look easy enough to make on my own). I would not recommend this to anyone, it is a waste of time and effort. It so sad too, I remember see an infomercial years ago on this and always wanted it. So, so, so diaspointed."
1,FRAUD,"I recieved clipss that broke on the first try, the directions were in russian and the main clip was a weird design when the description says black. They should not be allowed to sell on amazonTotal Hair Makeover Kit 90001"
2,Don't bother,This was a real disappointment. The directions are very vague and the products cheap. If you want something that's in the kit I would look for it in a Sallys or online and get that 1 item.
3,"Uhhh, a nice idea in theory.","To anyone who has normal/thin hair: I'm sure this product will work great for you, and you can feel free to ignore this review.To anyone who has thick hair: Ugh. This won't work too well for your hair. I wish it wasn't that way, but I have very thick hair and the product just seems to be a bit too flimsy/not geared toward thick hair."
2,Hairigami,"Very hard to use, maybe with a lot of practice it would get easier. Don't buy if you are planning to use immediately. This is where is I got very discouraged. Just haven't had the time to play with it so it's sitting in the box!"
5,Good medicine for weary spirits,"This is a wonderful book not only for spiritual warriors, but for everyone else too. Conflict resides within the kernel of all human relations and in nature too, and all too often we find ourselves overwhelmed by it and take actions that escalate the level of conflict rather than help to calm the situation. This book helps to remind us that in the face of conflict we do still have a choice, a position we can take that won't make us part of the conflict. It is the opposite side of the coin, or, as some would call it, the ""divine view"" that restores balance and peace.A great solace in times of world conflict, a good medicine for all weary spirits dealing with conflict in the great and small moments of our lives."
4,FUN FUN FUN,"THis toy was great, but basically the same as the Animal Planet Dinosaur playland. My son loved both of them. The other review here said it was just an empty box!!! Boy is she wrong. My box is packed full of fun dinosaurs! My 3 year old is in heaven!"
5,YEARS OF FUN!,I bought this two years ago for Christmas for my daughter when she was 4. It's still one of her favorite toys. She can sit and get lost in this little world for a long time while learning about the different kinds of dinos. The best thing about it for me is that it comes with a plastic box to keep everything together. To this day all the pieces are together while other sets are scattered in different containers. It's been well worth the money.
5,My nephew loved this,There were a lot of dinosaurs and my nephew plays with this all the time when he comes over.
3,Wonderful Box,"My son has tons and tons of fun with the dino box. He stands on it, pushes it across the carpet, opens it up and looks for treasure, even hides in it. However he couldn't understand why, when he first opened it, there were no dinosaurs inside. I had to explain to him that it was just a dino box. He loves it anyways."
5,I should qualify it with 10 stars...!,"Very ilustrative video, a must see for all the goverments all over the world. Is not exactly a video version of Garret's book, is an excellent complement. Almost 6 hours of evidence, opinions, history, etc. A must see video on schools, hospitals, homes, everywhere. But....WE NEED THE DVD VERSION !"
2,Missing parts,Was easy to order and got the part quickly. When received the lock assembly the inside box the lock came in was broken open and it was missing the retainer clip.
1,SECOND EDITION?? WHY WAS THERE A FIRST??,"This is the MOST BORING book I've ever read. Whoever read it for publication obviously knows NOTHING about computers. He constantly repeats himself and really says NOTHING---other than ""don't download from the internet and don't share files"". And it's obvious he knows nothing about viruses either. Doesn't give any description how to prevent them---other than buying virus protection software, which most computers come with now. By constantly repeating everything at the beginning and end of each chapter with litte content in between, the book could of been scaled down to 10 pages of non-repetitive words from the 350. It's ONLY redeeming quality is a couple C++ programs he copied from other people and some of the websites he mentions. Other than that, it deserves a rating of ""ZERO""."
5,Syndey Earl Wright was married to my Mom Rosemary for many y,"Way To Go Syd, This is Patty RobedeeI know Mom is in the Heavens Smiling down on you"
5,Review of Quickfix Total Body Toning,"I am a busy professional with a fulltime job, three girls, three dogs, am a Brownie leader and volunteer with two organizations each week. I needed the Quick Fix. That's why I bought this video. It is everything it promises. I got to all my important body parts within a short period of time (and my body parts are looking better). It made it possible to squeeze exercise (toning) into each day. Sometimes before work, before dinner or when things quiet down in the evening. Give it a try. Its your best shot towards fitness in a busy world."
5,well worth the money,"This product is wonderful, well worth the money. I bought it for my grown daughter. She was thrilled. She is building a new home and raising a family. This will follow the years."
3,small bag,"It's nice in that it has the Sony emblem, and it's a good quality bag, but it is really too small for the camera and accessories. Even though it is rated for my camera, I really need a larger bag. I thought that as they reccomended this bag for this camera it would work, but I have to struggle to get it to snap shut."
4,"Nice bag, though a bit bulky","I bought this along with a Sony DVD camcorder thinking it would fit quite nicely. However, the bag dwarfs the camcorder. Considered sending it back since it's the size of a purse while the camcorder is more like the size of my hand but once you stuff other things in there (cords, DVDs, etc.) it's not TOO insane to have a bag this large."
3,Nice Bag!,This is a very nice bag BUT it will NOT stay latched.It is a poor idea for a latch to close the case and I am constantly having to close the bag when I carry it.The inside is nice and the front zipper pouch is handy.Now if the silly thing would just stay latched and closed.I would not buy it again.
5,Love these dolls!,"I purchased several of these dolls last Christmas and was very pleased, as were my granddaughters that received them. They are super cute and a great size. They also have darling accessories."
2,overcost,"COST MORE TO SHIP THEN THE PRODUCT, overcharged for a very small package, was charged $4.55 for a package that had less than a dollar postage on it. The description was right on and the time for arrival was great. Just the cost to mail it. In the future I will just buy generic Tampons to start my fire. CHEAPER"
4,Tinder-Quik 10 pack,"Received this promptly, even received a few extra ones.The shipping is a little higher for the item. But itwas in great condition."
5,tinder,"This is very Good stuff to put in you camping gear, survival pack,,for any emergency that would require starting a fire"
4,A must,A must if you are into camping or traveling in a camper or RV. Easier than trying to find leaves in the desert or leaves in a wet area. I would recommend in any camping kit just in case.
1,Waste of Money,"Including shipping, these are over $10 for 10, or about a dollar a piece. For a fraction of this amount, you can go and get a bag of cotton balls and a jar of vaseline, coat each cotton ball with a dab of vaseline, and using an old empty pill bottle, sans label, you can have your very own backpack 'fire kindling' kit...for about $0.02 each. In the end, that's really all these are, anyhow...cotton plugs with an igniter on them. Beeswax will also work with the cotton balls...just don't be ripped off with a 'pre-made' gimmick."
2,Perfect for the lazy,"Perfect for the lazy. For this I am lazy, you can have the same thing with $0.10 worth of thread and cotton balls if you want to take the time to make them."
4,"It works, but there are more practical ways to start a fire.","As for the good things, I can easily light a fire using my flint. But the burn time isn't quite as long as advertised. My recommendation is to carry about 10-20 squares of toilet paper in a ziplock back (quality brands work best). It takes the same amount of space, and ultimately performs the same function. Just shred the toilet paper into a small pile (one square is sufficient), then shave some magnesium onto it, and it should light on the 1st or 2nd strike. My experience is that one square of toilet paper will burn for about 30 seconds, which is the same as I got out of this tinder. Plus if you need to do your business in the woods, you have an alternative to pine cones, and a couple of ziplock bags can always come in handy during survival situations.I have not tried using this when wet, but anticipate there is no advantage over toilet paper which was kept dry in a ziplock."
3,Wetfire is much better,Tried this as a part of a multi-element fire starting kit. Ive decided that it is not worth the volume in my kit. WetFire tinder is much better for me.
3,Not enough for tough fires,"Yes, those little things burn for about a minute or so, but if you don't have plenty of dry timber/brush, you'll be out of luck with just this. We tried Tinder-Quik this past weekend when we had to make fire right after it rained, and found that cheap matches and plenty of dry paper worked as well as Tinder-Quik in that humid environment and wet firewood.I can imagine that had we gotten our matches wet, Tinder-Quik could come in handy; then again, by itself it would not let you have a good fire in wet conditions."
5,Great buy!,"Picked this up for my BOB and can't complain. The price was right and if SHTF then I can rely on these little guys to keep the fire going and more importantly keeping me warm. If not then these will work just fine when camping. Thanks a bunch to the folks at Vigilant Gear, LLC keep up the good work!"
4,Good to have. Really just for emergencies.,"This product will do exactly what it says it does. Its just smaller than you would imagine. each tab is approximately the size of a tootsie roll. These tabs are really just something to put in your survival pack. I cant imagine a time when I would really need one of these to start a fire other than in a survival situation. If you are going camping and you know it is going to be wet, you are much better off bringing some fire starter matches."
4,"Burns easily, but not for very long","These are slightly too small if you plan on using a flint striker to light them, so I cut them down the middle (vertically) and spread them out by tearing it. This created a larger area for the sparks to land and turned out to be much easier to light. Unfortunately, by doing this, I think I sacrificed some burn time. If you choose to light them without tearing it, it would be best if you used a lighter or matches to do so.Overall, this is a fantastic product that is:Easy to light (the flint striker only needs 1-2 strikes)Small and easily portableCheap!Highly recommended."
2,"They work, but 10 is useless","Well im not saying that they dont work, because they do, but only ten? sure they send a couple of stragglers with the pack but what I use now for tinder is much better and comes in a pack of 100 for the same price, cotton balls...cotton balls are so easy to carry around and are really easy to use as tinder, i use them for tinder every other week."
2,Try This Instead of Tinders...,Hand Sanitizer and cotton balls. It works a lot better and is mucho cheaper... Stays lit for at least 45 seconds... Don't believe me? Try it... Thank you for reading this post..;)
2,Not impressed,"I am not sure what I was expecting, but what I recieved was 10 pieces of cotton. I would have been better served to buy a large bag of cotton balls for half the price"
2,tinder-quik 10 pack,Just got back from a 4 day trip and these little things worked alright. Have used other products that worked better. A little slow to get going. If things were a little damp I don't know if they would do the trick
1,Fell apart when used,Cheap damper fell apart when I turned on the fan. Blades not attached very well. Buy something else.
1,Flimsy,"The Broan 7"" hood damper is very flismy with a lot of metal on metal contact. It rattles so much that it is louder than the fan on my range hood."
1,Flimsy damper,"I've ordered this thing twice now. The first time it fell apart when I tried to install it into the ductwork. The second time, the very flimsy damper ""wings"" were already bent inside the packaging. This thing must have been engineered by a three year old."
4,Broan Range Hood Damper,"It's amazing to me that I bought a new Broan range hood (not a cheap one) and a damper wasn't included. It took a while to find where I could buy the BP87 using the Internet. It also took me a while to figure out how it needed to be installed on the range hood. The instructions from Broan were not clear at all. Once I did, I was satisfied with the purchase.While not mentioned in the ""instructions"", the BP87 need to be screwed to the 7"" duct adaptor plate. It is necessary to drill holes at the bottom edge of the damper through the adaptor plate and then secure it with sheet metal screws (I used 4 screws spaced 90 degrees). The damper works well to keep ""wind"" out of the kitchen along with noise from the neighbor. When the range hood fan is on, the damper opens very easily and closes quickly when the fan is turned off."
5,Broan BP87,With New Broan hood installed I found that a round damper 7 inches in diameter was needed. Seems no one in my area had one! So when I got this from Amazon and installed it worked great. No more cold air falling on top of the rangetop and across the kitchen floor and My Feet! AND it came from Amazon more quickly than the shop could get one in!
1,A true piece of junk!!!,"This is the worst excuse for a damper that I have ever experienced. Even Broan has removed it from their website which should tell you something.It rattles more than you would be willing to tolerate.I read the other negative review before buying this item and thought that with all the positive reviews there had to be something wrong with his. He was absolutey right. Those other reviews had to have been placed by someone with a vested interest in selling this worthless piece of junk.Once I track down and buy a better damper, I'll have to basically redo all the work in installing the range hood.I strongly urge any reader to avoid this product.If I could have give this product a negative number, I would have."
1,doesn't close,"While i agree that the 7"" damper for the broan range hood opens ok it doesn't close after the fan is stopped. Half of it stays fully open! What good is that? I would have paid more for something that does the job but this was the only 7"" choice."
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,It's really pretty flimsy I might not have ordered if I had read all the reviews. Shipping was fine the quality of the damper leaves something to be desired.
2,Clanky,"Not the best built / designed damper ever built, but it closes and prevents back drafts, so it does it's job. However, low speed setting on range hood barely pushes damper open, high speed makes damper clank clank clank clank, then a loud clank when it closes. So, all I can say is clank clank clank clank."
1,Who was born this special day?,After reading the editorial review I ordered this book. I thought it would be a great gift for a 3 1/2 yr old at Christmas time...another book about Christmas with beautiful pictures. WRONG! The book doesn't even mention 'the Christ child'- although the book JACKET does. This book will not 'evoke the true meaning of Christmas' as stated on the jacket. It'll offend anyone who already knows the true meaning. The answer to the question 'who was born this special day' was certainly NOT answered on the last page - 'it was the child'. WHAT child???
5,One of the best,"You might be tempted to skip the introductory theoretical material and go right to the ""do's"" and ""don'ts"". But this short, wonderful book needs to be fully digested. It's like having a preaching coach at your elbow.Schlafer will inspire you and save you from the unique pitfalls associated with preaching at weddings and funerals and other special days. Get this book and spend a rich hour with it before your next wedding or funeral. You owe it to the people you are serving! If you only use it for that, it's worth twice the price."
4,I cant believe it.,I wish every playboy video was like this. Its not as explicit as a penthouse video but they show pink! (if you know what i mean) I heard this was a new trend in the mag but I cant believe it translated over to the video.If they continue this I will have to start buying there videos again.
5,Memories...,"I really enjoyed reading this book, it was like talking to my 5th grade teacher, always telling stories from his childhood. Reading this was very funny, like when he was talking about Andy Griffith, and a few jokes, and how Andy laughs when he really thinks somthing is funny. It's a very good book for people who think Don Knotts is a great actor, he talks about, ""No Time for Sargeants"", ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Three's Company"" just to mention a few, but still more movies and shows he has done, not to forget his army days too!"
1,Another Missed Apportunity,"Andy, get Barney another bullet. He missed with this one. Okay, so the guy's sweet, kind, can't get a mean word out of him. He went through two wives, he had kids, he had disapointments and missteps, and he doesn't share any insight into the pains, joys and frustrations of his life with the reader. We see a picture of his kids, and that's it. What's their names, Don? Do you love them? We hear about a divorce, thrown out like an after-thought. With what little I've been able to glean from other sources, Don Knotts is maybe the greatest missed chances for comedy, ever. Without killing himself with drugs or stupidity, Knotts blew it. True or not? I'll have to look for the answer somewhere else. He blew it with this pablum book too. Hopefully someday someone will write a biography of the man, and we can see his humanity, instead of just his brave face."
1,I guess anyone could get a book published,"I have read alot of garbage in my day, but this one takes the cake! I can see Knotts as Serial killer Ed Gein perhaps, but who cares about Barney and that junk. Knotts, maybe the old age home should take away the ghost writer that wrote the book for you and take a nice long nap!"
3,Barney Fife and Other Characters I Have Known,"This was a charming book, written in an almost conversational tone. It gives a chronological run-down of Knotts' early life and entire career. It is, however, lacking in personal history. The births of his children are tacked onto professional rememberances almost as an afterthought. Overall, it is a satisfying read, and will make the reader want to run out and rent ""The Apple Dumpling Gang."" (I did, and my kids loved it!)"
5,Barney Fife and Other Characters I have Known,"With having a dog named Barney Fife you can guess that we are Deputy Fife fans. Purchased this book for my hubby for Christmas which he really enjoyed. Good price, seller and transaction."
3,Hey Barn!!!,"As I am sure most readers of this book are, I am a huge Andy Griffith fan. So when I picked up this book to read, I expected a few chapters on the show itself. What a let down!! Only a few short chapters at best. Knotts has to be one of the most talented funny men in television history. The character Barney Fife in my opinion is the funniest tv charcter period. The book is carefully written with no smut what so ever. That is fine by me, however the A-G show took up 6 years of his life, and he spends more time talking about the Apple Dumpling gang then he does the show itself. The title is a classic publisher bit, making the title ""Barney Fife....."" has a lot of people thinking that the book is going to be about Barney and Andy and the behind the scenes tales we all want to hear about. You will get some of that, but will be left begging for MORE!!!!!"
2,ok,"The songs were nice, but the tape was scratchy in all of my tape players. Not sure if it's the tape or my tape players."
3,Fantastic family movie,"This is a great family movie. It has everything - heart, action and fun. I've seen it twice already! This is the kind of film they used to make, and I'm hoping they make more of. I loved it."
2,Elf-man DVD,"Just got through watching Elf-man and was very disappointed! After reading the reviews (all 4 stars), I was anticipating a really good Christmas movie to watch with my son. Unfortunately, the movie started off slow and never really got any better! Mediocre at best! Save your money!"
5,Book enthralls teen,"The Children of the Anarii was the most addicting book I have ever read. As I was reading, I pictured the text in a movie format, fearing that if I put the book down, I would miss something vital to the story line.I have never read a fiction novel that was so developed in the characters and scenarios that I felt included in the story. Anyone who enjoys reading about things not usually discussed in main-stream fiction would absolutely love this book. As soon as I found out there were additional books, I found a place to order them. I want to thank Bek for supplying a book to the public that is so inspiring and thought provoking."
2,Soundtrack from Attack of the B Movies,"Having listened to the selections on this disc, I found it quite difficult to appreciate Mr. Kaufman's violin artistry. These tracks of modern era stream-of-consciousness-B-movie-sound- track music run together with little to distinguish one from another--excepting Still's insipid ""The Blues""--all replete with the sound deadening reproduction of the 1940's."
2,Slightly upset,"The quality of the item was fine, EXCEPT for the fact that the most appealing part of the book was not functioning as a result of an ineffective battery."
3,"Nice screen, but poor synchronization options","I have recently purchased both the 5001 and the 6000 series REX, and found the 5001 to be more flexible in its synching options, and less delicate.I use my REX primarily as an address book, to do list and notes. Input is not a big issue for me, nor is Web content downloads.The 5001 uses the Starfish TrueSync technology to synch with any number of devices, including cell phones, Yahoo and Palm Desktop. I actually synch mine with both Palm Desktop and Yahoo simultaneously so that I have access to my addresses over the Internet.The 6000 does not support TrueSync, limiting my synchronization options to be only Outlook, and the bundled desktop application. The 6000 also seems to be more delicate with both the screen and the buttons.Bottom line: I just returned my 6000 and am ordering a second 5001."
1,Not ready for prime time,"Great form factor, but many many problems. I agree with the earlier reviewer that the 5000 series is vastly superior. Not only is battery life better, but the screen is more legible (no touch screen) and the synchronization is much faster, as is general application speed.Oh, synchronization on the 6000...I never did get it to work right. Intellisync is just as bad on the Rex as it is on the Palm. You just can't trust it to keep your data in order. Truesync that is used with the 5000 works wonderfully well and hasn't ever missed a beat.So, good idea for the 6000, but I'm afraid that the lowly 5000 is much more useful, useable and a better value to boot."
5,Handy!,Very nice set. The larger one is great if you have a deer hunter that does his own butchering. Very nice sizes and clean easily!
1,Not worth the money,I've owned many cutting boards but these are the first ones that I felt like returning. I tried to chop garlic and slice ginger on these boards but the boards slipped and slid back and forth on my Corian countertop. Don't try to slice a loaf of bread because the knife may slip!
4,"Classic coverage - not most up to date, but will never be obsolete","Author concentrates on radiometry and detector basics, and does not give up to date performance specs on detectors or current trends etc which may soon be out of date. He does not cover readout electronics. I appreciate the fact that he derives a lot of things (formulas for integrating sphere, fourth power cosine law, etc.) instead of just stating results. He does the basics, and in my opinion does them very well. He also does not take forever to come to the point."
3,mech man,Love the graphics and commanding my allies!!!!!!!!!! I just love mechs and hope they can improve on it later later.
2,Careful with this game,"Although this game is a lot of fun, getting it to run is quite difficult. There is no support from microsoft and you can only relay with the information of the forums. This means each month that goes by it will become increasingly difficult to run, because of new video cards, mother board configurations and not to mention Windows Vista. So careful when you purchase it."
3,Not as pictured,"This is not as it is pictured. In fact we almost sent it back except that it is so inexpensive, we decided to find a tree to put it on. It really is a more bright red, not the nice maroon it shows here. Also the rooster is a bit hokey looking. It is pretty thin plastic, i am not sure how it is going to hold up outside under extreme weather conditions. It really looks cheap, but it isn't high priced, so you get what you pay for. I'll try to update later on to post how it is doing outside in the elements.Edit Oct 5, 2011: We have had this outside now since purchase and it does hold up! So that is a plus in regard to this item :-)"
3,Manfrotto strap,"Looks good, but doens't perform nearly as well as expectedSomewhat cumbersomeWhy can't someone make a bag that is also easy to carry?"
3,high maintenance knife,"The knife is sharp but the handle has weird shape and does not sit well in my hand. I feel it is rather slippery and too round, too small.The edge chips even I use it only for peeling fruits. The blade stains. If you do not dry the knife immediately after use, it rusts.Overall, the knife has all of the typical flaws of Japanese knives(chips, stains, rusts). It is not bad, but I recommend that you look for a knife with ergonomic handle."
2,Second rate,"This is the least durable knife I own. The edge does not keep and is easily notched. Ironically, the benefit of ""Damascus"" steel is its durability and tendency to hold a very fine edge. This is a pretty knife (if you don't count the notches), but the merits end there. I'm afraid my faith in Calphalon is now diminishing with every product I buy. Poor pans, poor knives."
5,This book is really helpful for Geography Bee hopefuls,"I give this book a 5-star rating because it really kept me intrigued. On a campout, i stayed up and continued reading it by moonlight. If you are a person looking for assistance in the National Geography Book, this is an excellent book. A whole bunch of questions appeared on my written state qualification exam (which i passed). Questions that helped included ""What is Pinyin?"" ""What is Manifest Destiny"" ""What are the horse latitudes?"". A lot of the questions appeared at the state bee, but, unfortunately, i didn't get any of them! But still, this is a must have and therefore gets my 5-star rating!"
4,New Age without the Baggage,"I can't tell you a lot about Uakti (I'm not even sure how you pronounce them), but this is a very unusual and often beautiful album. Categorized at World Music, you can hear the far-flung influences here, and while this definitely has a New Age feel, it comes without all the usual sentimental, tedious baggage."
4,Relaxing music let you no more trouble and pressure,"Excellent recording sound, skillful acoustic performance, all you need to do is sit down, enjoy your coffee, read some books......their sound will bring you in a relaxing world."
4,Moisturizer and detangler in one,"Although Original sprout is a little thick, it allows me to not use my other hair product as much so it save money as well. This keeps my daughters hair moisturized (which gets dry frequently) all day. I reallyt like the product. Would have been a 5 if it wasn't so thick."
5,Amazing product,"I never review products, but I have to say, this product is amazing. My 3 year old has long, thick, wavy hair, and post-bath brushing was a nightmare. This stuff is awesome--brushing is SO much easier, and her hair is glossy in the morning. It also works on dry hair, without becoming crunchy like the stuff from the drugstore. Simply the best."
5,"Great product for thick, curly hair!","My daughter, age 2, has extremely curly hair and it can be very dry and firzzy as well. I have had such a hard time with any other ""detanglers"" and she cries the whole time I'm brushing her hair. I was so impressed with this product because it gets the tangles right out and it leaves her hair a lot less frizzy with more soft curls. If I wash her hair, put the detangler in and comb through, the next morning I can just rewet her hair and it seems to reactivate the product; allowing me to comb through it again. Smells great too, I don't know why someone said it smelled bad."
5,IT WORKS!!!,"I have tried EVERY natural hair detangler on the market, and after using half of the bottle on my duaghter's fine hair it would finally be approchable to comb/brush through. The Original Little Sprout's detangler works in less than four mists!!! WE LOVE IT, and won't live without it!!!!"
2,Strong Odor,"I bought this product for my daughter and it does make it easy to comb out tangles and it does make her hair shiny and cuts down on fly aways, but, it smell so terrible! The smell is so strong and perfumey it gives me a headache so I would assume it does the same for my little one. I would be a repeat customer but not with this scent!"
5,wow it actually works!,"this product is really excellent. it detangles, fights frizz, and does not leave hair weighted down or greasy feeling. i think i'm hooked."
3,Just okay,"There's nothing miraculous about this product. We bought it because it can be used on dry hair, unlike the mixed chicks leave-in conditioner. Original Sprout does take the tangles out, but it doesn't keep the hair moist at all. When the product dries, it leaves the hair drier than before (maybe because it has alcohol). I'm looking for a product to keep her hair moisturized and shiny. It leaves no flakes or build-up though. That's a big plus!!!"
2,it's o...k...,"the real *miracle* is that they got me to pay $14 for this product. won't happen again.the stuff is fine. not sticky and smells nice. however, after using this stuff up in a week, i'm getting the same results by mixing water with some detangling conditioner in a spray bottle. i happened to use paul mitchell, but i'm sure any other product would work as well."
3,It used to be good,"I'm really sensitive to smells, and I appreciate that this product does not have any strong perfume odor. It works well and lasts a long time. After showering, I just spray 8-10 sprays into my palm and rub the conditioner into my daughter's hair (and my own--it works great!). Detangling is a breeze.EDITED December 2012: They've changed the bottle and formula. Now it has a perfume smell and leaves a build up on the hair. We're going to have to find a new product now. Bummer!"
2,:(,I bought this detangler for my bf's curly hair and it didn't work nearly as well as the review said it would.
3,SO SO,"I might buy this again. They only thing is it's kind of expensive, but, it is organic. I dont think it was that great getting out tangled out of the tub. But it does work great on morning bed head. I just would spray it on the frizzed bed head then lightly brush out and her hair looked great!"
5,Great for the curly ones!,"I have 3 bi-racial children, ages 5, 3, and 1.The all have curly hair that without detangler to comb out into lovely ringlets is a tangled frizzy mess and they are very vocal about the discomfort of having it combed out:(Thanks to the very high reviews everyone gave this product on avg, even though I literally did not have time to read them individually I ordered it.Its Fabulous!It really gets though the tangles and the kids love the smell.The care taken in making the product safe for our children is the icing on the cake.I will probably have to keep this in the house, you would think I was killing them when I comb their hair every morning up unitil now!Thanks again to all who took the time to come bk and review. Its a wonderful product and from now on I will do them same instead of being lazy LOL!"
5,Excellent Read1,"This book was an utterly gripping read. Not only is the scenery vivid and the characters feel like people you've known you're whole life, but it's a thrilling emotional roller-coaster! Elliot creates a world filled with deep emotions and I couldn't pull away from it once I started reading. A great book. Glad I stumbled across it. You should read it!"
4,"Good anime, bad English dub","This DVD was great! I watched Sherlock Hound as a kid, and had only good memories about it. I'm happy it came out on DVD! The only thing bothering me is the English version, which is very bad in my opinion. The actors are just plain, and the English accent, although a nice touch, doesn't add up to the whole thing. Better to watch it in Japanese! I know though that there is a French version which is excellent, and although there's probably not a very big market for anime in French, would it be so much trouble adding one more track on the DVD? Still, I recommend this cartoon to any Sherlock Homes fan, and any nostalgic young adults like me :)"
2,It's called Professional Baking because it's not for the home baker....,"Simple fact: This is a text book. This is the book that we're using in my Pro Chef/baking & pastry course, and we've discovered that many of the recipes/formula's in this book are NOT the proper ones (case in point: ever hear of tiramisu without the alcohol???)I've been told by one pastry chef to only do the formula's in blue, not the red - so might give that a shot - other than that, the recipe/formula's in this book are NOT easy to follow- but they're not meant to be - it's *really* not meant for the home cook at all - those looking at the book thinking of buying it need to remember that - it's called Professional Baking for a reason. That said, I wouldn't suggest it to professional bakers/chefs, either."
3,Smoke and mirrors,"Amid all of this book's hype, I really found myself unimpressed--particularly after one incident:I actually bought this text for my wife, who is a home chef, and she found it very difficult to follow. She said that the instructions were difficult, and many of the recipes did not work on the first try.I have used this book in my baking classes, and it seems to be decent for culinary students, but not for the home chef."
2,Not the product I thought I was getting,"I was attempting to obtain a Genuine Taxi Wallet and found the advertising for this very misleading, and felt it was deliberately so.Buyer beware."
5,Great text book of Alchemical study.,"The book, ""Spiritual Alchemy"", written by , C.C. Zain, is full of easy to understand alchemical terminology. The author easily explains The Philosopher's Stone, Transmutation, The Elixer Vitae, The Great Work, and Higher states of Conciousness. Bear in mind, this is a course textbook written by a Master Initiate for his students. But it may be enjoyed by all who share a love for The Western Esoteric Tradition. It is a wonderful treatise on esoteric lore and has my highest recommendation. Buy it today!"
1,Prepare to get lost...,"While this map is nice because its laminated, don't count on the information! Many roads are mislabeled and/or missing altogether. Don't waste your money here - the best Puerto Rico map is the one sold in the gas stations and drug stores on the island."
3,Harry Potter robe,$29.99 is a bit pricey for the quality. The description did not make it clear the wand or glasses were not included. The picture implies they are. I got a better deal for my daughter at the WBShop.com
5,Plays,It plays and the item was still shrink wrapped and the cds and dvd was included and not scratched. All worked out good.
2,Not good...,Marginal video quality.Marginal sound quality.Sade Live from 2001 is better but this one comes with a music CD.
4,Which of three versions is this?,"An all music website reports that ""The Sinking of the Titanic"" had been recorded three times. The first, for Brian Eno's Obscure label, was a landmark recording, but went swiftly out of print and became a much sought after collector's item, while the third, a relatively bland performance on Point, was widely distributed in the late '90s. In between, on the independent Belgian label Les Disques du Crepuscule, Bryars recorded what is possibly the definitive version though again, it is a difficult disc to locate. Who has this can tell us which version this one is? Thanks."
4,"Very Unusual, but very Satisfying","When I first bought this cd and listened to it, I must admit I didn't care for it, and I didn't listen to it for quite a while after that. But, recently, I was in the mood for something a little different, so I popped this one in. A lot of times I like to put the tv on mute, and listen to my music, and watch whatever happens on the screen. I love doing this because I am a huge fan of film music. I happen to be flipping through the channels and HBO was showing ""Titanic"". I muted the tv, and popped this cd in, and let the music do the rest. The experience was so heartwrencing. The beginning scenes of ""Titanic"" when they are veiwing it on the ocean bottom had a totally different, more ""personalized"" feel to it. This album is really unique. It really took some time for me to get used to it, but it was worth it. And oddly enough, I like music that is unusual, but this one took some ""gettin used to"". I would definitely recommend this for any ""Titanic"" freak like myself."
2,"obvious, superficial","I can't imagine that the reviewers who call this meditative, deep, poignant, etc. have much truck with the music of Morton Feldman, because if they did, they would hear this muzak for what it is. It pulls all the obvious, cheap thrills musical tricks for a ""deep, sad, moving"" soundtrack to a tragedy. Occasional interesting percussion touches. Those who listen to Feldman, Webern, Stockhausen, Cage, will find this superficial, more annoying than moving. A cut above Neil Diamond's Jonathan Livingston Seagull, though."
5,Meditative,"I wonder how many people bought this recording thinking it had something to do with the ""Titanic"" movie? And if so, how many kept the recording? Their loss. This is a great work, well performed and recorded. Repetitious without being monotonous, it's the aural equivalent of watching light move across the water as seen from beneath the surface. Recommended to fans of Eno, Philip Glass, and their contemporaries."
4,"A beautiful, melancholy piece - innovative and sad.","Bryars must be one of today's most innovative composers. His Jesus's Blood composition is exceptionally moving but not something one can listen to frequently. The Sinking of the Titanic uses a similar repetitive, tape-loop technique - the tune 'Autumn' is a constant theme - washed over with Bryars' classical orchestrations and sounds of water, metal and mumblings. It is a beautiful, melancholy experience. Bryars seems to have a way with composing music which is understated, poignant but always imaginative and unconventional. This album is probably one of his more immediately accessible - I highly recommend it."
1,Not Worth The Money,"Very Basic, and quite frankly old school. Not focused enough on Variety of Buyer Needs. Emotional, Economical, Rational etc. Do not recommend at all"
3,Not Bad,I had my hopes up high when I ordered this product. I live in Michigan where the winters are very dry and the summers are extremely humid. I have thick wavy hair and after using this product my hair didn't feel much different than other products I've used. I still had frizzy hair. I'll keep using it until it's gone but I'm dissapointed it didn't work for me.
5,Excellent Product,This product is very good it does what it says it would do. It keeps your hair frizz free and healthy looking.
3,Long N Strong Anti Frizz Serum is better.,"This stuff is decent, but I found Long N Strong 2-in-1 Anti-frizz and Hair growth serum to be better. Its actually the best stuff I ever used. My hair broke a lot less, and grew faster and it NEVER made my hair greasy! Which is great!It also lasts a long time because you don't gotta use too much."
5,Works Fantastic!,"I agree it is the best serum to smooth out ends. Typically, even if used sparingly, they are extremely greasy and work terribly on fine straight hair making it look greasy. I have fine straight hair that has all over bright blonde highlights and after blowdrying and styling every day, my ends need a little help. This product works amazingly well in smoothing out the ends without making FINE hair look greasy and way to soft to hold a hairstyle. Like any styling product, less is more. Use it sparingly, because a little goes a long way. Can be used on wet or blowdried hair. I tend to use it after I blowdry my hair when my ends look & feel a little dry."
4,Gives a nice shine,"Provides a nice shine, but make sure you use it very sparingly. I have very fine hair and if I use too much I look greasy. I use such a tiny amount that the bottle lasts forever!"
3,Curiosity killed the cat (me)!,"A seemingly amateurish detective story something like Nancy Drew kind of stuff (excluding the sexual references to Thompson Briephs' practices, of course).A mundane love affair --- quite unnecessary in the development of the plot. Such convenient way too, to end up the story so the couple can live happily thereafter.The only thing that kept me curious was the inclusion of the puzzles in the book. A good breather from the predictable 'twists' (if ever there was such a thing in the story). However, my curiosity led to a disappointment after reaching the end of the book. Like, huh? ""You made me read it till the end & this is all you have to offer?"" (sigh)"
5,Intelligent Mystery With a Twist,"I thoroughly enjoyed Nero Blanc's 'The Crossword Murder'. It harkend back to good old-fashioned classic mystery writing. Characters and situations were contemporary but with a feel that was reminiscent of Nick and Nora Charles. It was bright, stylish and challanging. The puzzles did however stump me in several places, but I don't want a crossword puzzle to be 'dumbed-down'. I was glad to see that there was a sequel, 'Two Down' and bought it as soon as it was available. Here's hoping this book series has a good long run with many sequels to come!"
2,cute idea that fails,"Combining crossword puzzles with a murder mystery is a good idea, but the authors don't carry it off. The writing is generally amateurish and the plot less than challenging. The authors are even relegated to the triteness of a climax that depends on having the otherwise-intelligent heroine do something laughably stupid, thus putting herself in mortal danger. Lastly, the puzzles aren't very difficult nor do they play a significant role in the solving of the mystery."
3,Good Not Great,"I picked up this book while shopping one day, intrigued by the fact that it included some crossword puzzles and I am a fan of them. After reading the book, I realised the crossword puzzles were extraneous and that I did not have to do the puzzles to help figure out who committed the murder.Private investigator Rosco Polycrates is hired by the mother of a murder victim (crossword editor for a local newspaper) to investigate the death, which is first ruled natural causes. He has the help of sexy (of course) but married Anabella Graham, the crossword maven for the rival newspaper.The writing was lively in some spots, but amateurish in others, particularly in its characterizations of the secondary characters, who mostly came across as stereotypes - ugly secretary in love with handsome boss, prissy society column writer, cheating aging sex goddess married to older man, etc.Not for sure if I will pick up the second in the series or not."
5,A Sure Eye Opener-Every Human Should Read!!,"Wow, what a wealth of knowledge for everyone! ""Mankinds Ultimate Dilemma"" should be on everyone's ""Must Read List"" a true insight into our daily and future concerns that face Mankind's ability to recognise and deal with the next 150+ years Globally & Culturally as the world gets smaller and smaller...This book will open your eye's and it is backed by tried and true science. No need to read the 40+ feet thick of science data, just read ""Mankinds Ultimate Dilemma"" you will get the picture. I will recomend this book to all my family & friends!"
5,"We Want The Funk,Gotta Have That Funk!!","There is absoulutely no going wrong with this two disc set.Every great Parliament song you could possibly want is included.Any true funk lover must have this set,bottom line."
4,Following Your Dreams,"Crossing the Pacific Ocean. Now, there's a dream many have long held. This book does an excellent job of telling you how to do just that, regardless of whether your dream will be realized or not.The book assumes you will be traveling by sailboat, and visiting many of the major points of interest in the wide Pacific, from the Aleutian Island to Japan, down across the tropical zones of the Pacific to the cold forbidding Antarctic regions. The primary emphasis is on cruisng the tropics, however.I am planning to depart on a voyage across the Pacific ion a few months, and have found this book to be right on target for my needs for planning this great trip. If you want to join us in spirit, just buy this book!"
3,Only Advanced Should Buy This!,"I gave this 3 stars only because I'm a beginner-intermediate to yoga. This is definately for the advanced. She constantly transitions smoothly and very quickly from one pose to the other. Never stopping to let you get into a correct pose or cach up; therefore, you can't do the poses correctly. I miss half of the workout just trying to catch up to her. For one of the segments of the video, you are in the plank positon for almost the whole 15 minutes. If you are advanced, then buy this DVD because you'll get a great workout!"
1,awful,what a load of insufferable tripe. reads like it was written by a high school sophomore on mushrooms. this guy knows nothing about rock music or life in bands. avoid at all costs.
2,Amarillo - Disappointing,"The reason I got this single, was a) for charity and b) for the video.So I remember buying the single from HMV earlier this year and it had (Is This The Way To) Amarillo (Which was good), (Is This The Way To) Amarillo [Disco Mix], which was the same except with the same beat and The Laughing Record, which was pointless.The video I found out, didn't work on a DVD Player, just the Computer and on the Computer is was bad.So unless you're a Tony Christie fan (Not me), you just want to get the video or if to raise money for Comic Relief, I see no reason of getting the single as it is a rip off!Jake Potts"
3,Wild Republic Children's Pillow-Horse Pillow,"The pillow was smaller and a little flatter than anticipated. Also, the background was a forest green as opposed to the blue background depicted in the picture on the website. The green background was a bit of a surprise, and doesn't exactly match my daughter's decor, but being the horse lover she is we'll keep it."
2,Short But Not Sweet,"If you're curious about this event this dvd may be more than you need to know. Be warned Yoko is nearly unlistenable.She does have a lot of good songs that can be found on the ONOBOX but here she just wails tunelessly on Yer Blues and Cold Turkey.It is fun however to see if you can watch the dvd all the way through without someone else telling you to shut it off.The Chuck Berry ,Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis clips are all cool but i'd really love to see the Alice Cooper Group performance from the same day."
4,Good for a John Lennon fan,"This dvd was good except John forgetting the lines of the songs Money, Dizzy Miss Lizzie, and Give Peace A Chance. He did do a good job on Cold Turkey except he got one line wrong and he did good on Yer Blues. I don't know about Blue Suede Shoes because I haven't the real song of it"
1,For Lennon fans only,"""errr...this is what we came for really....ELLYELSHAN!!It's errr... give peace a chance so, sing along will ya. I've forgotton all those bits in between, but I know the chorus so""...Nuff said...."
3,"Great Performance, Bad Film","John Lennon along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry performed a rock and roll revival concert in Toronto. One song from each is presented here, as well as John Lennon's entire performance. The music here is fantastic; the problem is that the cameramen seem way too focused on John's beard. First there's a close-up on it, then the camera leaps back for a full shot of John. This technique is very disturbing, and heavily plagues the film. But the music is great, so for that, the film is worth it."
4,Three Acts and Rare Presence,"Sweet Toronto...ah yes! Bo Diddly, Jerry LEEe, CHUCK BERRY, and the Little Devil Himself (Little Richard);are well worth the price of this DVD,and then some. To see them at this point of space/Time...and their ""Top Hat"", 50s Hippie-Rocker Roller, Sterling preformances, is a Keep-Sake. John had his Magical Mystery Hat on, in arranging for them to be there.Johnny's Presence, guitar, Voice, and ""signature"", is also Star Striking ! As for Yoko.... well...thats Called ""ART"", and Eric Clapton is a very Kind Friend To John Lennon.This Segment of the Film MUST BE Viewed, atleast once. PersonaGratis, and the First Preformance of ""Give Peace a Chance"", besides other Charms, are well worth it. John was not my Favorate Beatle, sadly to say (most of his Life was Really..Tragic), But the Beatles and his solo music could not be seperated. OWN THIS FILM...now !!"
3,Yoko Blows,"This is an interesting DVD. It starts out with a few peformances from classic rockers like Chuck Berry, and then Lennon takes the stage along with Eric Clapton on lead guitar and Yoko on annoying squawks. It is cool to see Lennon on the stage at this point in his life, but Yoko's wailing quickly drives you to insanity. At one point Yoko crawls into a bag and lays on the stage, unfortunately, she climbs out and finds her way back to the mic. Yer Blues and Cold Turkey are pretty interesting versions. Clapton looks stoned out of his gourd. All in all, nice DVD for a Lennon fan."
2,"The performances are historic, but...","As with the album that came from this concert (""Live Peace in Toronto 1969""), the quality of performances is very uneven. Yoko's songs are not ready for prime time, and her attempts at singing and vocalizing make Linda McCartney sound like a nightingale. Nevertheless, the rough, underrehearsed sound of the Plastic Ono Band is still exciting 31 years later.The film would be worthy of three stars just for capturing Lennon and Clapton in a historic concert were it not for the low quality of the cinematography. The film looks lousy, even for an impromptu filming. Buy it ONLY if you are more interested in the authenticity of Lennon trying to establish an identity separate from ""Beatle John"" and less interested in a polished product."
2,Not that great,"This game is really not what I was hoping it would be. First, it's controls are fairly complicated for getting simple things done and it allows you to do stuff that is inappropriate. For instance, it is possible to fold a hand that was checked to you. Second, it makes you sit through a fake shuffle and deal sequence each hand which is just goofy. It really serves no purpose other than slowing the game way down. I hope the makers don't think that are actually recreating the feel of a real game of poker. They shouldn't even try, that is not what this game is for. Third, the computer players play like idiots. They will call repeated raises with nothing pretty much down to the river. Once they get low on chips and pot odds dictate going All In with almost any hand, they will begin to fold much more regularly. So they play almost exactly opposite of what they should.I don't recommend this product."
2,"Not bad, but could have been better","This hand-held game is ok for familiarizing yourself with hold'em poker, however it has some faults. Probably the best feature is that it allows you to have multiple human players ( up to 7) and also select the number of computer players. This makes it easy to play hold'em where it would be difficult to play cards normally, like in the car on a road trip with friends. Word of caution: the computer players are much easier than real life players. They are ""calling stations"" and nearly always call bets to the showdown at the end. Just because you can make thousands of ""digital dollars"" playing this gadget doesn't mean you are a great player. One programming glitch it has is that it allows you to have the option to check pre-flop, in a real hold'em game you don't have that option-you must bet, raise or fold (checking is not an option in the first round of play pre-flop)."
1,SHAME ON SEAN,"Back when Sean Young burst onto the movie scene with roles in BLADE RUNNER and NO TURNING BACK, it seemed her star was really shining. Lo and behold, the sometimes competent actress is reduced to starring in a film like this. Ditto to William Devane, who for years entertained us on KNOTS LANDING, he too should fire his agent for getting him involved in this psychobabble mess.Young plays a sexy psychoanalyst with unconventional techniques whose patients keep disappearing. Devane plays the father of a hot-tempered former boxer (a studly but untalented Will Schaub), who evidently was pretty cruel to his sons.The plot is so contrived with a distraction of an unconnected murder, and the rest of the cast are reminiscent of community theater actors, and that's an insult to them.More time is spent on showing naked women, some of them apparently bulemic or anorexic, and the whole thing is just a waste of time."
1,Don't be fooled by the cover...,"This is the worst movie to ever be made in the history of movies. However, if you like softcore porn, you may actually enjoy this because that is about all there is to it. I would have to say there is more plot in porn movies than this movie. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is terrible. After you watch it, you don't know whether to laugh or cry that you actually spent the money on it. I have seen some really bad movies but this has to be the worst. No joke... However, if you don't heed my advice and you do buy this movie you can always use the disc as a frisbee for your dog or a coaster to put your drinks on. Personally, I'd set it on fire and see how fast it burns. That would be more entertaining than what this film had to offer."
1,Orion Dead at 53,"Although ""Orion"" (Jimmy Ellis, Orrville, Alabama) never attained the fame he so desperately sought, he was an object of much affection from his loyal fans who constantly supported and encouraged his career. Ellis and his wife were murdered in 1998 during an attempted robbery of their family business in Orrville, and the funeral was attended by many grieving fans from as far away as Canada. Ellis was survived by one son and his family."
2,Printer can't recognize the cartridge; had to throw it away.,"I've only installed two of these so far, 1 recognized fine, the other wouldn't recognize no matter what I tried. I ended up having to throw it away."
5,earns high marks all the way around!,""" This collection of original piano and piano/ensemble compositions earns high marks all around.Spielberg`s highly developed sense of melody is enhanced by a technical facility for the piano which lends an almost vocal air to these pieces....thoughtfully arranged and sensitively executed...Spielberg`s ability to conjure up visual images through purely instrumental works ranks among the best I have heard anywhere."" -The Music Paper"

5,"relaxing, insightful music","Robin has composed some beautiful, very original music. The insert in the CD explains each song and its theme and inspiration."
2,"Flimsy cheap,",Replaced the plastic lazy susan we had for 15 years. The old one cracked around the bearing. This one lasted one year and we were careful not to overload it. The shelves cracked around the bearings and the full length of the shelf. Broke right in two. I don't know if more expensive ones are better. I am trying a wooden one for $125.00. This one was $80.00 with freight. I think it will be $45.00 well spent.
4,very good vendor service,"Originally received this package as an open box with missing parts - not ""new"" as was listed. I quickly wrote a negative review.However, the vendor went out of their way to get me the missing parts in a very timely manor. The service level was very positive."
4,A lot of fun,"I got this DVD as a surprise for my fiance. I did a lot of research before hand on different videos. I wanted one that was sexy, but tasteful and informative. This video definitely fits the bill. All the subjects are fully nude but it is still informative and instructional. My only criticism would be that it moves a little fast. And it seems to detract from the overall experience a little when you or your lover have to keep hitting pause to keep up with them. You will, however, learn a lot of great massage techniques and the lucky recipient will receive a relaxing full-body massage. You are first walked thru a complete back and leg massage. Then you are taught a very thorough frontal massage that literally ranges from head to toe. This was a lot of fun for both me, as the giver, and him as the receiver. I can't wait until it's my turn to be the receiver!"
2,Poorly done,Cheap production and vague script. Soft core scenario doesn't help or produce any sparks. I sent it back and will look further for a good massage DVD. Disappointing.
1,Not the best,Slow moving. Poor quality video. Not complete technique on either male and female. There must be something better!
1,connectivity problems...,"I have 2 computers connected to this router, and each computer gets errors saying ""network cable unplugged"". they come on at the same time. Other times the error will say limited or no connectivity.My roomates had this router, we called the support and they said the router is probably bad.we got a new one, same model, and its having the same problems.I am not completely sure if the router, but thats all what it would seem to be, our ISP it would be the router, but Dynex does not know why.Sometimes we can surf the itnernet for horus without it disconnecting, other times it keep disconnecting for hours."
1,Difficult to figure out the installation directions...,I think the item is extremely complicated to install and configure - and - I have IT experience as well!After reading the instructions on the CD Rom that came with it I scrapped the entire project!
1,Bad purchase.,"After setting up this router, it would not connect to the internet. I, then decided to disconnect the router and try to connect directly through the modem, but I could not connect on the computer with which I had tried to set up the router, but I could with my other computer. Since I had bought the router from an ""unauthorized"" dealer, Dynex would not give any tech support. Dealer had no idea what to tell me, he was unfamiliar with Vista. I then contacted Dell who manufactured my computer. The tech at Dell could not resolve the problem, so he conferenced with me with my internet provider. The two of them could not work out the problem. Finally, I restored my computer to the settings from the day before, rebooted the computer and got my internet back. The router is now in my trashcan. Where it belongs, as far as I'm concerned!"
5,The Island of Nose- sure to tickle your fancy!,"This book is so interesting, from start to finish. I no longer have access to this book- because Grandma burned it years ago! She bought it at a garage sale after only looking at the first couple of pages, but once she realized that there were pictures of exposed phalluses and breasts, it went right into the attic! Of course, we all still found it and marveled over the artistry every chance we got, but she put the ol' kibosh on that as soon as she found out. Some people have no appreciation for art! Truly, this book is wonderful to behold and one of the most imaginitive I have come across, if you can get past the nudity. It's one of those Graeme Baese-like books where you keep turning back to the pictures to see what you missed! I highly recommend this book as a conversation piece for the wide-eyed wonderer in all of you."
5,It's a book...,Exactly what the professor told us to get... So far the book has been an easy read and plenty of good examples.
3,Pretty good...,"I have been using this book for my class for the past several weeks. This book is adequate for my class, though I doubt I will keep this in my collection once I am finished. I think my main gripe with the book is that it provides lengthy examples for tasks that were very easy to understand, yet it glosses over the examples that were very hard to comprehend.One of the parts was how they gave about 4 or 5 examples in converting numbers to different bases, when the steps are virtually identical, yet they don't have any examples of IEEE 574 (floating point) conversions, even though floating point covers an entire section of the book.This is hit and miss. I will use it, but this book will not be added to my collection of school books that I have kept when I finish a course."
3,Excellent Survey of Computer Architectures,"I recently used this book for a course and agree with the reviews that it is easy to read and very concise. It provides a wide scope of computer architectures and covers these well. However, I did find it frustrating at times that it provided too cursory a coverage of the computer organization pertaining to memory. This was especially prevalent in its discussion of caching and virtual addressing. It did not provide enough technical discussion or indepth examples although the illustrations were excellent."
5,Smells great!!,I got it for my BFF for Christmas and she loves. The price was great too so that was even better
3,Not Realistic,"This book is good but not realistic at all...Jessica and Elizabeth have a new friend whose parents own an amusement park, so the friend sends gives them their own rollercoaster without telling them or thier parents first. Then all their friends want to do is ride the rollercoaster instead of playing with them, and strangers show up at their house to ride the rollercoaster. They want to get rid of the rollercoaster because they think it is causing too much trouble, so they write fake complaint letters from the neighbors."
3,Pretty good book,"The book A Roller Coaster for the Twins was a pretty good book,but not one of Francine Pascal's greatest books.A few other things happen apart from what is in the summaty.Jessica and her best friend Lila have a fight because of the roller coaster,and the Twins and their brother Steven want to get rid of the roller coaster after they see what it has done,and start pretending to be neighbors complaining about it.The book wasn't bad,though."
4,Cook Book,This book is very well written and easy to follow. I made one of the items. I found out I don't like rosemary! Thebread it was on came out great! I will make some of the garlic based toppings next. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to cook. I used a pizza stone and parchment paper to cook on that made it supper easy.
5,GREAT book!,"I have made almost every recipe in this book and they all turn out PERFECTLY! It's amazing what a good cookbook can do for you're confidence. Buy this book if you have a kitchen aid mixer, because everything needs lots of kneading. I am asked for the recipes almost every time i make focaccia using these recipes. If you buy any bread book, buy this one!"
1,Disappointing,"Amateurish video quality; Pat Metheny hardly plays; cover is misleading. Nana Vasconcelos' percussion solo is an unexpected treat, but it isn't enough to salvage this disappointing DVD."
4,Humor Helps,"I thought that book was very helpful. It added humor to a sad situation...and was not insulting because the advice wasn't from someone who was suppose to uplift your spirts (like your best friend or mom). Lisa's workbook approach encourages you to write everything out - which in turn, makes you really THINK through the relationship, work through your feelings and put you onto the path of recovery (without expensive therapy bills)!"
4,closed great at the finish1,"having some knowledge about the story generally, i was concerned about holding my attention through the introduction of players, plot and inside jargon,etc. how wonderful to read along at a nice afternoon clip all the while being pulled in by some very imaginative and creative twists and turns.main character developement was exceptional (far craftier than other phil reed characters, low rider) and the pace of the closing chase though exhausting was worth every minute of it.the marquisde fraud is a really satisfying read."
5,The Marquis de Fraud,"A great read! Non-stop action that makes you want to keep on reading (in one sitting, if you have the time). You'll learn a little about the horse racing world and at the same time meet some well-developed characters, some you'll like, some you'll love to hate. The plot moves along nicely, not too slowly, with a few surprises scattered about. All in all, a very good book, one I could see becoming a very good movie."
1,worst show ever,"I wish I could give this show negative stars. Awkward posing, uncomfortable moments, dumb noises, but nothing funny. The jokes just aren't funny."
5,Great Piece of Equipment!,"Great piece of equipment, be sure to have your butcher block oil on hand though (either mineral oil or the actual thing) I use it for everything pastry, a great way to keep the onion smell off of your sweet dishes."
5,Birthday Present for my sister,"I ordered this as a gift for my sister! She loves it, this pastry board is just as the description implies and arrived as ordered."
4,Worth having for the Lone Ranger storyline alone,"By far the best of these programs was The Lone Ranger---well written with exciting and meaningful stories---followed by The Scarlet Cloak, The Shadow, The Green Hornet, The Green Lama---and sadly, by far the worst of them, The Adventures of Superman, which is just poorly written propaganda for government policy (which is apparently all that is meant by ""Truth, justice, and the American way""). Three and a half stars."
5,Oh my...one of the hottest bands ever!,"This is proof to those who did not see the Mothership that she was sailing higher than most any band that took the stage in the 70's. What a hot concert, what a crazy group of people that was putting on this hot show!!! buy it"
3,FUNKSTA HARD..........,Great to have in your collection.....pity you couldn't see more of the band untill they came out the front.......man is he on drugs or what !!!!Bring back the memories........filming was kinda average....Cross dresser funksta.....aye...seen them here in NZ....ok will be looking at other dvd's of Parliment...see if I can get a better one.....Eps..........
4,P-Funk in your home!,"There is nothing in the world that can compare to the comfort of a concert in your own home!! This DVD provides that and much more!! In typical P-Funk style the stage is crowded and smokin'!! It is very colorful and the sound is absolutley wonderful! G. Clinton did an outstanding job on the song selections, eventhough every song that he ever put out can't be on here, the choices are great. Glen Goins did a masterful call and response and sing-along on ""Mothership Connection"". The concert effects of dropping the Mothership is far out, and very entertaining! Plus the camera work is not bad at all, for a concert recorded live from Houston, TX @1977, which was originally released in 1986 on VHS. Other song highlights are, ""Undisco Kidd"", ""Dr. Funkenstein"", ""Let's Take It to the Stage"", ""Night of the Thumpasorus People"" and many others. I highly recommend this for all true Funkateers!!"
3,"3 stars, but buy it anyway!","Three stars for quality only, five stars for content. As one reveiwer here points out, the year was 1976, but I believe this DVD could have been both audio and video enhanced using modern technology. This show is off the charts awesome there is no question about that, but the sound and video quality are seriously lacking. Be that as it may this dvd is rare and special stuff and since this is the only material of this type from an historic band, I recommend it anyway. You can still see and hear what a power force the P-Funk was and remains to this day."
4,"Funk at its best...however,","The show was from the 70's and the lighting just wasn't good. There are many shots from the concert where it is dark???? What's up with that? However, the music/funk was never better."
1,Not the best...,"This DVD is much older, but I guess I expected too much. The band is sluggish and the filming is terrible: color is bad, sound isn't that good, and whomever was filming looks like practice."
1,A Major Dissapointment!,"I only wish that I had read a review like that of Wesman's prior to my purchase of this DVD title. I am astounded by the fact that the one reviewer threw out about the $250,000 prop of the space ship. I am not kidding you, this could not have cost more than a grand to construct. I have now seen the Mothership as well as the even bigger disappointing DVD, Atlanta House of Blues. Unless there is another DVD title that Amazon does not offer, there is not a decent George DVD available. I agree with the Wesman, go see him live! No one matches the energy or funk produced at a Clinton show. I need some of what these other 5 star reviewers were smoking...."
1,I was ripped off,I ordered an online e editon 2 volumes and CDI didnt not get the online pin number. I wrote to amazon and Still I havent heard from themIt is a total cheating
5,Best robot game ever,"There are loads of robot games in the video gaming universe, but none can come close the MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries experience.With precision joystick or mouse, gamers get to experience the exhilirating thrills and spills of giant robot combat minus the arcade feel of less serious games like MechAssault.MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries is also more than just a first person shooter game since it involves armoured combat that is reminiscent of medieval knight dueling but with hi-tech weapons.Best of all, MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries has a thriving online community that is replete with open game servers, leagues, clans, mods and fan-fiction writers.So, get the compilation, even if all you want is just MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries. It helps to play MechWarrior 4 and its Black Knight expansion first before playing MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries.That way, you can prepare yourself for going online to play Mercs with veterans. Rest assured, many vets are more than happy to accommodate fresh blood."
4,"Fun game, but a little buggy","I've been into the mechwarrior games for years, and this compilation pack is a great deal on the MW4 series. There are some bugs in the programs, I've had a few complete system hangs in the middle of missions, and the pathfinding abilities of the other mechs on your side are really bad, they get stuck behind buildings and can even get stuck on each other in tight quarters preventing any of them from moving and forcing you to restart the mission. Despite the bugs, this is a fun, fast-paced game, and I've enoyed many hours playing it."
2,Singer 7466 does not live up to its name,"Until three years ago I had been sewing on a Sears Kenmore which I purchased in high school (over 30 years). I finally decided it was time to upgrade. I purchased the Singer 7466 but did not actually sew on it for almost a year (moving, disabled, etc.). My mother still sews on her original Singer and it sews like a gem. I have had numerous problems with this machine: will not sew with the cover on; foot controller sticks horribly; needle threader never worked; have not found the 13 needle positions it purports it has; one step buttonholer?-have not seen that happen yet; today, I cannot wind a bobbin-it stops and I get an 888 code--the troubleshooting tips in the manual are a laugh. I have emailed their website and never have received any help. I may have received the occasional ""lemon"" but this experience has helped make my decision on purchasing a new sewing machine--it won't be a Singer."
2,Problematic,"My office has been using this photocopier for about a year now. It's in a 24/7 pharmacy so it's being used constantly. I give it the two stars for being able to keep up with our demands, the speed is acceptable.During the past year it's developed numerous problems. The machine has displayed system error messages on about 3 occasions and I had to call Sharp support and type in their secret button combinations to get it fixed. Sharp witholds troubleshooting information from their customers in order to benefit and secure their tech support department.Sharp gave us a refurbished replacement unit and it eventually started having the same problems. Now the machine makes a loud humming noise after every copy, though I suppose you can get used to the noise after a few months.The toner cartridge has also leaked inside the machine a few times, causing a big mess we had to vacuum up.It's come time to replace this guy. I'll be trying a different manufacturer, perhaps Brother or Canon."
4,Great Copier But . . .,"As replacement for my faithful Sharp Z-52, this AL-1631 works like a champ, but don't place much reliance on Sharp Customer Service. When unit came out of the box Sept 12, the hinges on the detachable multi-bypass paper tray were broken. When I contacted Sharp, I was told they do not sell replacement parts. Under warranty, I could have returned this BRAND NEW copier and received a REFURBISHED unit with an intact bypass tray. Needless to say, I declined this no-brainer offer. Sharp should make these parts available online as Sony and other manufacturers do. After striking out with Sharp, I contacted Amazon's customer service which I should have done in the first place. My defective copier was picked up by UPS the next day and a new unit shipped second-day air with no hassles. Replacement works perfectly. Kudos to Amazon for prompt and efficient customer care."
1,Sharp service STINKS,"Sharp has THE WORST service I have ever dealt with. I had the AL-1551, and when I bought it I was told warranty would pay for repairs. What they instead do is send you a refurbished.... the refurbished I got was worse that the broken one I had. I had to sue them to get my machine fixed, which only needed a plastic piece in the document feeder (probably cost them $5 in parts). STAY AWAY"
3,CE Credit,The CE credit for this book expired in October 2011 and is no longer available. This information came from the publisher.
5,"So far, so good","Prior to purchasing this product, I did a lot of research on squirrel proof feeders. None seemed to really do the job, and I agree with others that 100% squirrel proof is probably not possible. But after just a few days, my squirrels (grey and red) seem to have given up. They get on the top of it, and there is no place for them to go except onto the ground, as the tube that holds the feed is very long and they cannot reach the perch/feed holes. Gone also are the large blue jays and grackles. They did not even try to feed from this. Even chipmunks have given up. My only concern was that my larger grosbeaks and cardinals would not be able to perch, but so far so good. This is a large, heavy product and looks like it will easily handle the winters. I will update this review if the squirrels figure out how to feed from it. GREAT PRODUCT!!!"
3,Not great for cardinals,"This summer once the brewers black birds moved in to the area, the smaller birds, cardinals (and honestly, I don't mind feeding the blue jays even) all had a really hard time getting to the feeders once 11 brewers blackbirds moved in. I picked this up at a local hardware store, and hoping it would at least allow the cardinals to eat. The cardinals don't get bounced but the food ports are too low to the perch to allow the cardinals to eat. Unfortunately I would not recommend this feeder if you want to feed cardinals with it. Otherwise the chickadees, nuthatches, and other smaller birds don't mind it. Though the gold finches haven't been back to check it out either. Time will tell, but the cardinals look pretty pissed off at it."
2,ABSOLUTELY NO NEED FOR THIS,"I decided to pick this up when i bought disasterpiece because i've been looking at it for a while and never had the urge to buy it. I was blown by disasterpiece, the best live/band dvd i ever bought. But when i put in welcome to our neighborhood, i wondered where everything was? The interview was crap, the music videos are on disasterpiece, and the band introduction is worthless. Maybe this woudl be good for the music videos, but disasterpiece is out, THIS IS WORTHLESS, im very sadened by the fact i wasted my money on slipknot merchandise."
1,Don't buy it,I made the mistake of buying this DVD. Nothing is really new on this DVD except for a few minutes of bonus footage. They should have at least put more interview footage on it.
2,they could do better,"ok my frend jordan let me barrow this dvd. it was ok. on the dvd you get a chose to pick eather 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, righteach pick has the same thing. same music video's the same people talking it just shows the same thing over and over agen. it not woth the money.Disasterpieces was SO much better."
2,Good thing it was a trade of points on my credit card,"Well... I went to a local store to trade some points on a credit card I am about to return or cancel. I asked the guys how much points I had for trade for credit in the store and they gave me the ammount so I start to see what I could pick up.My first choice was the BlueRay of 'Rust in peace' from Megadeth but I had to give $11 in cash, but I am going to make some spends for the hollydays so I went for something cheaper ... the Slipknot DVD was then choosen.I dont want to bore you with my review... two stars are split in this order,star 1) I am a Slipknot fanstar 2) I had some time holding the purchase of this so I finally get it for my personal collection.This DVD should be retired from the market and be included as a bonus DVD on Iowa or the self titled... So, you are warned, are you a big new fan of Slipknot?... get it, are you a multi taste metal fan?... look for disasterpieces.RIP Paul Gray."
3,so so,"I was wondering wether to give this a 2 star or a 3 but i considered that if it is slipknot it is at least a three star and if they have a 2 or 1 star it has to really suck. but when i got the dvd i thought cool a slipknot dvd. the minute i got it i watched it but i noticed some disturbing things such as some blurry scenes so some of the time you dont know what the heck is going on, the interview is short, the camera moves around alot during the live performances, and the worst thing is it's no more than 25 minutes long. I know i'm just a kid but i am a big fan of slipknot i'm even atempting to get one of the very few m.f.k.r. albums that i had to get from the U.K.! Anyway the dvd has some good parts like the spit it out home video and the surfacing live song was awesome audio wise but most of time the camera just cant stay still for more than 3 seconds! in my opinion this dvd wasn't good but it wasn't bad ethier."
1,it sucked,im a huge slipknot fan but when i borrowed it and copied it i totally sucked i like the disaterpiece better i gve that a 6 out of 5
3,From the Nazi Era,"This is a must-have for admirerers of Dame Schwarzkopf since it places her voice very early in her recording career (this is from the 30's and she last recorded 40 years later) and in a repetoire not usually associated with her (that is for those that were recorded, she performed, but not recorded, almost every soprano part during her carreer both in Germany, Austria, and Covent Garden).But this is a two-for: rare Scwarzkopf and rare Verdi. With her distinct timbre, Schwarzkopf is easily identifiable in this amazingly-good audio recording. Many say that Walter Legge was her master and molded her voice, but here when she was very, very young, the Schwarzkopf of the silver voice shows through. One can see that she was a rising star for her artistic, not political (or sexual) qualities and what Michael Reichausen saw in her when he attempted to capture the German lied near the end of Hitler's terror."
3,Are you planning to build or design an RF circuit?,"This book is NOT for you if you plan on building or designing an RF circuit. It is definetely not for the TECHNICAL consumer.But it is meant for people who just want to get the gist of RF technology. This review is to warn people who are planning to get into the area of RF. You may want to purchase RF Circuit Design by Chris Bowick instead. If your into the theory of RF, avoid this book.3 stars and no less because it was well written. No more no less.And Carl Weisman was right, when he said ""hide the book from engineers."""
4,"Light & enjoyable, for the most part","Way back in high school, just before becoming a computer nut, I was a radio hobbyist and would have really enjoyed this book. Even now, as a CS/EE guy I still found it great toilet seat reading. It's not a heavy, serious book - it's light reading, sometimes annoyingly so; but with that in mind, entertaining & informative. Wish it had more to say about Spread Spectrum. Look forward to the DSP version, but hope it's ""heavier""."
4,A must have for entry level professionals in the RF industry,This easy reading book will make the complicated RF industry easy to understand.
4,Just What It Purports To Be,"Excellent overview for a person who does not have a formal engineering education nor exposure. Appropriate balancing of depth and breadth of topics. I recommend it; worth the investment and time. Other titles are not primers, or they are telecom not wireless tomes, and do not focus enough on the wireless topics."
4,Not Great Visually But Who Cares??,"OK, so this is not the greatest video visually. The colors are blah, the focus leaves a lot to be desired occasionally, and the stage sets are far from exciting. But if the most important asset of opera is the singing anyway, this is the video of Les Troyens to have. Jessye Norman's voice is clear and powerful, and the role of Cassandra the prophetess gone beserk is a great one for her. Even though Domingo's role is a punishing one he does much more than survive it -- his singing is a triumph. Troyanos is wonderful as Dido. Also wonderful is Levine in his young prime conducting an orchestra that is as polished as wonderful as could possibly sound in this sprawling behemoth of a masterpiece. For those who love these singers and love great singing and opera in general, this is a video worth having!!"
4,Beautiful traditional staging of this masterpiece,"The Met performance of twenty or more years ago is still the one to see. The cast is flawless. Jessie Norman as Cassandra gives the best performance of her illustrious career and the young Troyanos and Domingo are also superb. A huge cast with excellent ballets (there are several) does this remarkable work justice. I give it four instead of five stars because the sound is somewhat under-recorded. I had to really boost the volume. Nevertheless, this is THE Troyens on DVD!"
2,No English subtitles,"I only select operas that have English subtitles, so it was very disappointing to find out that Les Troyens did not have English subtitles even though the product description clearly lists English subtitles. Since I didn't know what was going on, I can't review this product."
1,Use your imagination.,"I like this opera very much, but while I found it musically as good as the cast and conductor would lead one to expect, it is visually so disappointing that I gave my copy to the public library. If this performance is on CD, listen to that with your eyes closed and watch the performance you create in your own head. It can only be better."
1,defective pioneer classic,"This is about the pioneer classic issue of the Met performance. My disc was defective starting about half way through on 3 DVD players -- 2 Samsung and 1 Akai.Very sad, because I was falling in love with this performance based on the first half. I think it has been remastered by DG or someone and maybe someday I will try that one. I would only warn if you buy this make sure you can return it. To the eye the disc looks perfect. I seem to be the only one with problems who has written here and so maybe it is alright for some machines.Comment added later. On reflection I suspect that the disc was damaged somewhere along the line by Amazon shipping or vendor. The box is bowed in."
5,An invaluable resource for anyone with neurotic tendencies,"One of the most useful and *gentle* self-help books I've encountered in a very, very long time. Unlike some books that almost make you feel guilty if you can't ""overcome"" your neuroses, this one acknowledges the difficulty of eliminating one's neurotic tendencies and then shows you how to turn them to your advantage. Yes, to your advantage.The book is a very easy read and filled with immediately useful advice. But don't let it's accessibility fool you - the information and ideas laid out in this book are rock solid. If you even suspect you might be neurotic, stop beating yourself up and buy this book. The only thing you'll regret is how long it took you to discover it."
3,OK,"This book is decent but after reading I was totally convinced I did not have a neurological disposition. The stories in the book are way far more complicated than what I thought I was...so I guess I am okay...I mean everyone is okay but jeez, this book was just alright. Nothing very special and I have found more help in reading about being mindful...you can check out Thich Nhat Hanhs book: You Are Here. I am sure it will help much better than this novel."
4,needed more discription.,"I took a gamble and I got lucky, I needed an 18 inch piece of aluminum duct. It came as I had hoped, solid and just what I was hoping for."
4,A Suspenseful Book!,I bought this book to try out a new author. I was not dissapointed. A Palestenian detective is paired with a female Shin-Bet investigator to solve a series of serial killings. The Palestenian detective was formerly a detective in Detroit.After the murder of his family he returned home. He and the Shin-Bet agent form a good working relationship that eventually leads to a romantic laison. This book does a good job of describing the worlds of both Palestine and Israel. The team have to deal with some dangerous and seedy characters with their investigation. When they finally reach the guilty parties the killers are very shocking to say the least. A plot to destabilize the peace process is under way. This is definitely a well written book. It also impressed me with Jon Land. Read this. You will not be dissapointed.
2,Unimaginative whodunnit posing as political thrillier.,A new fan of Jon Land I bought this book on the strength of the reviews. Little more than a cheap detective novel the characters are as shallow as the plot. It was an effort to turn the pages.
3,Not enuf info,"The DVD itself has good content, but I like to be able to time my workout so I know when I'll be done (to start dinner, go to work, etc.) The DVD cover and inside has NO information about running time, what props might be needed, etc. May be a small problem for most, but surely the publisher could have put this info on the cover."
1,Don't Be Fooled,I Bought this CD for the Live Tracks and the Quality is Horrible.The rest of the tracks can be found on any greatest hits album
2,My response is a little different.........,"I listened to this after reading the almost unanimous praise it received here on Amazon, and one thing is correct, it is compelling. However, I found it eerie and actually terrifying, like a snippet from a psychological horror movie. I can't listen to it anymore; it is beautiful, but unpleasant and disturbing. As odd as that sentence is, you may want to check it out."
2,Disappointed-of little value other than background noise,"I had hoped to use a portion of the cd for a presentation, but it was so hard to decipher the words that without a lot of work to set the context and hard listening by the audience-more than I could expect and still hold interest, it was not workable."
1,jesus' blood never failed but this cd sure did,"In fairness I must admit I bought this cd because Tom Waits was involved, knowing nothing of Gavin Bryars. Having now heard the cd, I hope I never hear from Mr. Bryars again. I admit the idea of using a found tape of a hobo as the launching point for orchestration is intriguing, but the experiment went horribly wrong. This cd became annoying after about the first three minutes, and from there soared to new levels of obnoxiousness. Even the contribution of Tom Waits does little to redeem this pretentious absurdity. Jesus save us all!"
5,Understated and Moving,"I first heard this piece three years ago. I was sitting in a darkened classroom. My music appreciation professor introduced it by telling the background story. I was thoroughly expected to be annoyed and disinterested. However, I was far from either. I actually became very emotionally moved. The understated elegance and emotion of the orchestra underscores the pain and hope in the derelict's voice.The orchestration is simple, repetitive, and at time's easy to overlook. Just like the life of the original singer could be. Yet at times it also holds great jubilation and hope. The mixture of musical principles and emotions is breathtaking and touching. This is simply one of the greatest minimalist works ever created."
5,More of the same,"NPR should just have this song featured weekly, because like some many of the other reviews, I too was driving to the store when this song came on. I sat in the parking lot for the next 5 minutes listening transfixed. The next day at work I searched for the song on the internet and found the account Bryars gave of the old man. It is an incredibly engrossing experience that can move you in tremendous ways. There's nothing more I can really add that the other reviewers haven't already touched on. It has to be heard to be believed."
1,"One of the most boring, annoying CD's I have heard",I just don't know what anyone could like about this album. I listened to it twice and then gave the CD away. I feel bad for the person I gave it to.
4,Almost too much of a good thing,"You'll either run screaming from the room or be paralyzed with emotion. I fall in the latter category. Not recommended for people with short attention spans, this recording expands a little too much on the more powerful original version, tripling the length. I don't agree with those who feel Tom Waits adds to the piece; I prefer letting the anonymous singer get the last word. Still, as many have said, the melody is unforgettable, the singer's voice brimming with devotion and the chamber strings section lush and eloquent, a happy medium between the spare opening and overdone conclusion."
2,this one escapes me,"I should love this album; maybe if I'd heard the original (others complained about this re-release) but to me it sounds poorly mixed and kind of dull. And endless. Just not hearing what brings people to tears. And I love found recordings and all. I heard about it via the re-realased Bush of Ghosts booklet that referenced this as a landmark, and maybe it was, conceptually and musically speaking but it fails to reach me."
4,Strange and wonderful,"This piece defies normal categorization. It may drive you nuts or it may creep under your skin into the subconscious. The sleevenotes tell the history behind this highly unusual musical loop that gets built out into a minimalist symphony of sorts.My only criticism would be that the orchestration could have been rather more varied in places, but that tramp's voice will really get to you."
5,I stopped and broke down in tears,"A few years ago, I was driving along listening to NPR. On comes a review of this album, giving one or two minute interludes at time. It was all I could do to stop the car before I broke down in tears. Since then, a professor recently reintroduced to the piece to me during a drawing class. The effect it had on the whole class was the same. A truly magnificent work, worthy of our attention."
5,Unexplainable,"Nobody can explain or describe this album. You have to hear it for yourself. All of the reviews here, both positive and negative, are 100% accurate.I found it hypnotic. A friend of mine said it ""frightened"" him."
4,"Wistful, peaceful, and victorious","The testimony of this man's life shines through his simple song and wavering voice. I notice several reviewers have dismissed the man as a drunk; actually, according to Bryars, the man wasn't drinking. http://www.gavinbryars.com/Pages/jesus_blood_never_failed_m.html"
5,Very touching,"It amazed me when I read, a few scroll downs below, almost the same story as mine: I also heard this album for the first time at night, from a public radio station, going home after a hard day's night. After searching for a while, I found it here, and it is one of my remarkable experiences with contemporary composers. Very toughtful and respectful work by Bryars, who found out early that he was dealing with something very powerful, even not being a religious man. He was careful enough to present it delicatly. Amazing, intriguing, and very powerful."
2,Mediocre blanket,"The quality left a lot to be desired. After only a few days use and one washing (first one), there are several areas where it's coming apart. It's not as soft as some reviews indicated. It's just OK. Ended up folding it and putting it away to use for moving or something similar later on. Took out the micro-fiber one that I forgot I had and am still using it."
4,Be forewarned - Wash separately,"We purchased this blanket in purple. When it came time to wash the blanket, I wisely decided to wash it alone instead of in with the jeans and other dark items. Washing in cold water, this blanket turned the wash water a delightful shade of purple - almost looked like grape juice. It produced an incredible amount of lint both in the washer and in the dryer - I stopped the dryer cycle several times to clear the lint filter. Other than that, this is a fine lightweight blanket - just right for fall or spring when sleeping with the windows open."
2,A bit thin,This was a pretty color but a bit thinner than I expected. The cotton is also a little scratchy.
3,Okay,"These blankets are just okay. The colors are not very true to the colors represented. They bleed a lot when you wash them. They are not soft. There are a lot of loose yarns coming out. I have been using them for years but, would not buy them again if I had the choice."
4,Sage Blanket Review,"This is a great blanket. It's soft and perfect for the summer. I also like that I can wash it at home and not have to take a bulky comforter to the dry cleaners. The only thing I'm a little disappointed in is the color. It looks much richer on the website than in person. The color says sage green, but actually looks more like a pea green. This is a very minor concern, but thought it might be helpful information."
3,Nice blanket,"This blanket has a nice weight, and the color is wonderful. Although, like most cotton blankets, one must watch for pulled threads."
1,still have not received this product,"ordered product 10/07/07. Today's date is 11/06/2007. Still have not received product after two e-mails declaring this product on "" back order"". Shipping and stock is ridiculous........."
4,"good looking, easy to read","I just bought my third one of these watches. They are nice looking without being gaudy, and keep good time. The only down side is that the mechanical day and date indicator assumes that every month has 31 days. If you fail to reset it at the end of a 30-day month, it stays one day slow. That would not happen with a modern digital watch, but I much prefer that analog dial.Why have I had three of them? The first had had a number of years of somewhat rough usage as my only watch. It still worked well, but I wanted a better looking watch for dress occasions. The second was fine but failed (out of warranty). So, I bought the third one, which I could have avoided if I had thought earlier about using the first to make a heart transplant on the second (cost $5.00). I now have two good looking functional watches, which should last me a long time.."
3,nice watch - but watch band way too small,I don't consider myself a BIG guy - 6ft-190 pounds -therefore I was amazed that I could hardly get the flex band over my hand !!!Nice watch for the money - but plan on buying another watchband if youare not a under-average guy !
3,Great at first but rusted quickly,"This hardware cloth is heavy duty and a great value for the money. However. We used it to predator-proof the outside of a chicken run, and after less than a month it began to rust in strips along the 48"" width. It has been three months and the wire continues to rust. We will probably have to replace it next spring, using a more expensive, better quality hardware cloth that we hope will hold up better."
3,Globetrotter Travel Pack Malta,I like to purchase travel guides that are not more than one year old to insure I am reading up to date information. This Travel Pack of Malta was described as a 1999 edition. In fact while the Travel Pack was put together in 1999 and contained a 1999 map of Malta the Travel Guide which was 90% of the package was a 1996 edition. I feel this was a misrepresentation of the package since most of the information was compiled in 1996 not 1999 as I was led to believe.
4,Not perfect but overall great.,"This book covers a tremendous amount of information that the general woodworker needs to know but would likely take 20 years to learn on his own. So why isn't it sold in my local wood working specialty store? Because it has a weak first chapter that can be confusing and slightly incomplete. Other parts of the book are better written. Don't let the first chapter scare you off just keep reading, it gets much better and quite thrilling at times. By the time you finish you will feel as though you've taken a college level overview course on woodworking. The information gets deep but is decently written for the non-engineer most of the time. I feel lucky to have found this book."
3,Out with the Old,"I've been using this book for years, and it has come in handy, providing a lot of useful information over the years. But now I'm looking for something more up-to-date. The Encyclopedia of Wood comes from the United States Department of Agriculture and is the best wood technology reference around. And it's a better bargain...a newer book at an old-fasioned price!"
4,"Exceptional, but not perfect!","This book contains a great wealth of information, my only complaint is the data is not referenced for sources of information. Trying to verify or follow up on specific information is not easy."
4,Information Galore,"This book had a lot of information that I personally didn't need, but lacked some that I wanted. Most noteably wood identification. It presents an entire section on this topic, but only shows microscopic views of different species, which is pretty useless to me. The author assumes that if you're reading this book, you can look at almost any piece of wood an identify it, thus making a pictorial directory of wood almost beneath the sofistication of this text.It is a well written book if you want to understand the science of wood. Think of it as an anatomy & physiology for wood. I would have given it a 5, but ommitting normal pictures of wood types seems to easy to have been left out."
5,Should be required reading,Excellent book about all things wood. Should be required reading for anyone working with wood.
5,Exceptional Reference,"I was amazed at the level of detail and depth of knowledge revealed in this book. To read and master all of the material would be the work of many months -- think of it as a graduate school course. Fortunately, this book does not need to be treated as a textbook. Simply find a topic of interest, and dig-in to learn a wealth of practical (and background) information."
1,"Beautiful piece, disappointing performance.","Used this ONE time and the beautiful enamel coating flaked off the bottom and cracked out on the inside. It was used according to the enclosed directions (for proper temperature range, manner of usage, etc.) with great care and it still essentially ""broke"". We can't use it any more for fear we'll be eating the porcelain enamel chips in our food. I had high hopes for this casserole dish because it didn't require seasoning and would be easy to care for - and it comes in nice, bright colors. I would not recommend this cast iron dish at all, unfortunately. Too bad."
3,"Good, but with problems","I work as a medical interpreter and use this as my main reference tool. I particularly love the anatomical diagrams, and that the dictionary gives regional usage of words. One very serious problem though - when there is more than one option for a translation, the choices are listed in alphabetical order with no consideration for which choice is the most frequently used. So, I might have to try out a number of words before I hit on the one that the patient understands (I'm also studying for a certification exam and have no way of knowing which of several choices is likely to be on the test). It's common practice in dictionaries to list the most commonly used choice first - this would have been much more helpful. I'm currently shopping for another dictionary that doesn't have this problem."
4,Good Start,"The first half of this book is in English, translated to Spanish, under the Alphabet headings. Very good, very concise. The next section is again in English, with medical terminology and the spanish counterpart, diagrams of body systems with Eng-Span conversions, and skeleton. Second half of book is the same as first, only, its Spanish to English. Very helpful book. Good start for someone like me who is just learning the Spanish language."
4,It's better than using a fork,"I can't complain considering the options in the US, but I really love the one I bought in Argentina much better, the shape is more for the gnocchi, rounded top, not a rectangle board kind of big for the little gnocchi. Considering there's not much available here, is ok and of course much better than having to use a fork for shaping. If you never used other types of gnocchi boards, you won't know the difference. The price is cheap too!"
5,Must have,"If your into making your own Gnocchi, After using this one time, you'll never go back to using the tins of a fork...... it's so easy to use. I'm finding my self finding different recipes and trying them all with this new toy. It's really easy to use and they come out just like Mario's. It's great........ and the cost is no big deal....... However, you do have to take care of this, it's real wood, and needs to be treated as such....... not the top shelf of the dishwasher...... this needs to be brushed clean, wiped down and put away dry......."
4,Simple and to the point,"A very simple product, but found that it worked as advertised. My only complaint would be any sort of instructions for use. I had seen one used before, but if you hadn't, instructions would've helped."
4,"Colorful, inexpensive, work just fine!","I am not sure why some other reviewers rated these floppy disks so low, but I have had absolutely no trouble with them - and I have used them on a number of different computers (from home to office). They work perfectly fine every time and have not failed at all. The price is right; they're colorful (my day certainly needs brightening-up sometimes!), and the box they come in is great storage. While it may be true that now we have better storage media in the form of CD writers, not everyone has a CD writer - or wants one for that matter! Meanwhile, all PC's still come with a floppy drive and these disks will work perfectly."
3,Floppy disks are old news but very usefull,"If you don't have a burner yet, what are you waiting for? Floppy disk are pretty usefull sometimes but let's face it, they're getting old and 1.44 megs doesn't store much these days (except for small things like homework and stuff like that) I don't use floppy disks much now a days but the price is pretty good for 40 floppy disks. So if you don't have a burner yet (cd-rw preferably) then i guess you can am.. probably.. get.. these.. i guess... but get a burner already will ya? ^_^"
4,"Flat, not Thin","Only Amazon's product title is misleading. HP's text is accurate. This is a big CRT ""normal type"" PC monitor. It does have a flat front, not curved like many [other] CRT monitors. However, it is not a thin LCD or Plasma display.If you are looking for a regular 17"" monitor, this unit is very good for the price. The picture is stable, sharp and accurate with good contrast and brightness. This may not be the very best possible 17"" monitor...If you are doing pixel accurate graphics work all day long, then spend the money on a better monitor. If you are running games, standard applications, surfing the web, looking at pictures, or watching DVDs, then this is a good monitor for you at a great price."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"As the saying goes, this small and inexpensive book gives you exactly what you paid for ... very little! The introduction to the book consists of three pages and the katsinam which are shown, though accurate, are certainly not some of the best examples. The primary katsinam for various seasonal dances are included, but very few others. One would be wise to chose other books on the subject."
1,God its bad.....,"Anyone that thinks that they can listen to this cd more than one time through is full of garbage. Blackie Lawless should be ashamed of this material, the sound and the production. WTF? I am a WASP fan. But KFD should be a give away cd and no one should be required to purchase such garbage. Blackie, stop trying to be something you are not. Get back to Crimson, your first release or Unholy Terror. You have it in you. And get some real production. Chris Holmes, go away."
4,QUIT YOR WHINING...ALL OF YOU.,"I'm tired of people saying this album is crap. This record definately has it's place in the catalog and is something for all WASP fans to hold on to. Things like KFD, Kill your Pretty Face, My Tortured Eyes and the like are not your standard WASP fare, but are dripping with anger and emotion that is 100% real... not being pissed off for the sake of being pissed off. Those of you who are serious WASP fans know that we are always wondering what Blackie is going to do next, and we appreciate that. Some people don't care for it...fine. But people saying it was a waste of money and it's nonsense are just completely full of it. Don't buy it yet until you spin some of the other discs first, but get it. You'll realize it is a valid and very cool piece of work."
2,Industial Attempt Of Yet Another 80's Rock Band,"What the heck is this? It sure doesn't sound like W.A.S.P. I can tell it's Blackie on vocals but what is going on here?Is every band I used to like going to have to go through growing pains or something and release a bad industrial sounding CD? You can compare this to others like Danzig, Crue's, etc.'s , lame attempts at being an industrial band.Some songs are okay on this CD but nothing is good. Go back to having a bit of melody guys!"
1,Too small surface area to work,"I actually have used several 3M products, and most have worked well. But these little hooks just don't stay up even to hold very light paper objects. I'm not sure why they work so poorly, but my best guess is that the surface area of the adhesive strip is just too small.In contrast, I've used the large 3M hooks with great success to hold up rather heavy robes in the bathroom."
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased these Command Hooks to hang 4 picture frames through out my house, and in the middle of the night all four frames fell and broke. I would not recommend this product, not only do I have to replace picture frame, but i now have to purchase a more reliable product"
5,Command Mini Hooks,"Love Command Products great for hanging all kinds of items. Perfect for hanging keys, dish cloth, any small items. Have them in all sizes for all hanging events."
1,Don't Buy - Destructive to Walls,"While I was originally prepared to compliment these hooks on their ability to stick to the wall, I discovered that when I tried to remove them, each of them managed to rip off pieces of my wall that I'm now going to have to patch. Don't buy them if you ever plan on taking them off your wall."
3,Good for small things,"These are nice in theory but can only hold very light things - I use one to hold a statement necklace that doesn't fit in my jewelry box, and another to hold a mesh bag, but most things are too heavy and/or big for these hooks."
2,Dont hold anything with weight to it,"These are great if you want to hang something light weight, but dont expect to hang picture frames or anything from them. We tried putting two behind an 11 x 14 frame and they came off the wall immediately."
1,WASTE of money!,"These were a total waste of money, and they were NOT cheap either! I re-decorated my son's bedroom as a surprise. Since we had just spackled and painted his room, I didn't want to put a lot of nails back in the wall to hang things. I was so thrilled when I found these; however, they did not work AT ALL. We tried hanging VERY light things(using mulitple hooks, mind you)without any success for more than a day. After multiple attemps, I said forget it because I knew that something I was attempting to hang was going to end up falling and getting broken with these useless hooks. Furthermore, when they fell off, they took the new paint with it! Not only did they not work, but they were NOT damage free. I ended up using small hanging nails in the end, which was what I was trying to avoid in the first place by buying these. These were a complete waste of time and money, and also damaged my freshly painted walls! NOT HAPPY!"
2,Did not hold weight,I ordered these to hold up Christmas cards strung along my fireplace mantel. They fell all the time... didn't hold.
4,"Great Price, But They Are Definitely Mini","I currently have medium sized hooks which are five times as big as these hooks, so when I ordered them I didn't expect them to be so small. These clips are pretty much good for keys and maybe a couple of necklaces or other light weight items per hook. The good thing is that the adhesive is the same size that comes with the larger hooks, so they're interchangeable."
3,Meh,"Pros: I had four of these up and they held small objects (static loads) just fine. Before applying I cleaned each surface with 95% isopropanol.Cons: Three out of the four were difficult to remove after a year. Instead of the adhesive stretching and eventually pulling completely free like it's supposed to, the adhesive broke (one out of four came away cleanly as advertised). Instead of being to reuse the hooks I had to break them apart to get to the adhesive. The adhesive did eventually come free of the wall without damage but it was much more difficult than expected.This seems to be a problem restricted to these tiny hooks--the larger ones have worked just fine for me."
2,Didnt work for us!,"Oh my these did not work for us! I have used them in the past for my shower curtain tie backs and they worked just fine. Even in a damp setting! Following the directions: I lightly wiped the walls down, waited 30 mins then proceeded to line them up the wall (hanging a paper light) waited 30 mins and put everything in the clamps. seriously was just a power cord going up a corner and they kept popping off the wall! I used all the sticky things up and now just have the holders. Not for us."
4,"A fun read, especially for gardeners","If you are in the mood for a light hearted mystery that is fun and full of gardening tips, then this is for you. Ripley goes along at a leisurly rate (the murder does not occur until around page 100) but her characters are interesting and fun. Every third chapter or so, there is a small gardening essay covering various topics such as composting, organic pest controls, roses, etc. If you are not into gardening, you can skip these because they are essentially unrelated to the plot."
2,no content,This book had no content to it. It wasn't a story for entertainment for anyone. It was just a bunch of repetative sentences. With a bit more effort the author would have had a better product. It was a definate disappointment. I bought it as a gift for a 2 year old. I'm glad it was delivered to me rather than my sending it directly to the child. Once I looked at it I decided that it wasn't worth sending. My lesson was to definately read reviews.
3,Not so sturdy or engaging,"I checked this book out from the library for my 18-month-old son, and he was not as interested in this book as in other lift-the-flap books... but I honestly don't think the construction is very sturdy and the flaps often fold back the wrong way."
1,"Seen them live, heard the record.","Retarded, in all aspects and meanings. What? Is she trying to rip off Veruca Salt or does she just have no talent. The husband is okay."
5,Awesome,"I love the recipes and the pictures were stunning and the food taste as good as they look, it keeps you cooking"
4,If you like stock market books!,"This is a history of various market declines and panics. Providing some useful insight, it is well written and deviates from the normal how to buy stocks book. If you want a good read and like stock market and finance books, you should like this."
5,The Real Oedipus?,"I read this book years ago and then lost my copy but the memory stayed with me. Recently, a friend gave me another copy and I reread it. It was even more compelling this time. When I first read this most accessible of Velikovsky's books, I was much impressed with the author's linkings of coincidence and the uncanny effect of each of the connections identified by the author. Upon rereading, I am even more impressed. Would that we had a generation of young readers who might be interested in such a puzzle and I would much appreciate their feedback. This is remarkable, intuitive scholarship that is very well worth the investment of time required to glimpse a first class mind at work and be rewarded with an answer as to why this one, singular Greek myth has so many elements that are not particularly Greek and here are matched with so much that is unmistakenly Egyptian. The Sphynx knew more than one secret and Velikovsky reveals it to us. Bravo!"
4,Small,It's totally adorable and already loved dearly by my 4 year old but I was a little surprised how small it is.
2,Impossible Installation!?!,"I bought this for home use...loved the duplex/copier/scanner functions and my TI Microlaser (circa 1991 is just about dead)... brought it home to install. Finished the install procedures and doesn't do anything (other than make great copies). My jobs go to the print queue and then the printer s/w takes over and tells me that the item is ""Scanning"" even though there is no action from the unit...it will stay this way for hours.I reinstall (per the instructions). I try a third time.I call Sharp's helpdesk. We delete my other drivers (for printers I still use), and reinstall the AL-1641CS. Tech tells me that since I have had a HP driver installed, it will likely never install correctly. I asked, ""So, do I put it in the box and take it back to the store?"" Tech replies, ""Either that or reformat your computer."" Hmmmm. I'll try another tech before I haul it back."
3,Fine book,The book is being used by my tutee's AP Calc class so it is the one I had to get. It's a fine book and covers the curriculum appropriately. I find some of the explanations and motivations a bit to simplistic.
1,It's totally not what it is.,"The book doesn't have an original cover, and it looks like it was stolen from a library since there is a bookcard inside the book"
3,late arrival,"Book was in good condition, only thing is that it was shipped very late. I received the book almost after 15 days of placing my order."
1,Bower Lens Pouch,"You get what you paid for with this pouch. It is made of padded nylon. There is nothing soft about it inside to protect you lens. I'm not going to use this to protect my lenses, but I'll find some kind of use for it."
1,Clunky Game,"This game is a total waste of money. The controls are slow and clumsy. You cannot simply toggle through the puzzle from one space to the next. Instead you must use two hands to move around, then stop and put your hand back on keyboard to type in letters. If you use arrows to move, you must arrow over, then hit enter, THEN click the mouse to designate direction. By the time you finally get to each square to type in a letter, you have lost interest. The opening screen is all silly advertising. You must go through layers of screens to even get to the game. Buy the HOYLE Word games instead."
3,Switchroo?,"I have many of the figures already & bought this set in hopes of completing my set. Unfortunately I received only some the figurines shown. I now have 3 of some & am still missing others. I am very disappointed. The figures are also a bit scruffed up. I am wondering if they are actually seconds. Price is excellent, but what good is a dollar saved if you spent a dollar on something you didn't want?"
4,Great fun for kids and adults alike!,"The Rudolph and The Island of Misfit Toys (12) Figure Collection is great fun for the kids, and also works great as a desk decoration for the holidays.If you put any of these on your desk you can bet that your coworkers will be picking them up and playing with them too.The only issue with this toy is that, while durable, they are not indestructible. They seem to be made of some sort of plastic/clay hybrid, so they will break if dropped onto a hard surface.This shouldn't prevent you from purchasing this set, but it is something to keep in mind when you children are playing with them since the broken pieces may become a chocking hazard.Overall, if your family is a fan of the Rudolph movie this set is a lot of fun around the holidays."
4,Groucho steps into The Master's shoes,"While investigating a murder on a Sherlock Holmes movie set, Groucho gets to gather all the witnesses and reveal the culprit in classic detective style. Mr. Goulart has crafted a story which succeeds in being both an effective mystery and truly funny. As I've come to expect from this series, the story is surprisingly deep, with Mr. Goulart also giving an interesting glimpse into the politics and attitudes of the times. I'm eagerly awaiting the next volume!"
1,Order it but you will not get what you ordered,"I am sorry to say I really cannot review this item, because I never received it! I was sent, what they thought was a ""comparable"" keyboard, without the adapter, stand, etc. that was listed in the description of the PSR-175. I emailed the company shipping and called, but I didn't receive an explanation of why I didn't receive the one I ordered, if it was out of stock they don't sell anymore anything, I only got a credit for the shipping which, of course, did not cover the cost of buying the adapter and stand. This was for a birthday and I was very disappointed."
5,We salute you!!!!!!!!,"I am 35, and I have been an AC-DC fan for 25 years ever since I borrowed my brother's cassette for Back in Black, this DVD has most of the best of the band and in a Live stage in front of a huge crowd which adds up to the extra addrenalin boost you are going to receive when purchasing this DVD. Panoramic scenes and takes, light show but best of all the performance and sound are very good for this production. I could be watching this DVD everyday, actually I do. This is what I wake up daily to and you should to. The whole band still rock like always."
4,"If you love rock n roll, this is a must!","AC/DC at it's best + Blu Ray = Great music, great picture and pure rock n roll. Buy this disc, use it for all sorts of occasions and what a great way to show off your new home system."
4,AC/DC Live At Donington,"Excellent sound quality, and a great concert. Picture quality as goodas one can expect from a concert from the early 90'. If you are an AC/DC fan and got a PS3 / blue ray player this is a must have.."
3,An average AC/DC DVD,"This concert is a basic AC/DC concert. If you have seen any other AC/DC DVD you have seen this. It is a great DVD but angus does to much improvising with his guitar. That seems to drag the concert out. Angus has trouble with his guitar in Let There Be Rock it seems and it is a little bit annoying. I didn't have a clue that this DVD had been overdubbed. They Say the solo in Fire your guns was changed and that was a fast hard rocking solo but I can't like it anymore. I just want raw hard rock angus never needs overdubbing. Overall it is a good purchase with some good songs. Brian performs every Bon song great exept for jailbreak he sucks at that. Oh and if you don't like the camera moving so much just watch some of the songs in Angus,Malcom,Biran and Cliff Cam."
4,Dirty Deeds,"I usually don't like live performances, but this one was really pretty good. The songs are all top-quality and the guys look like they're all having a blast on stage. A very energetic show."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"It couldn't be more blatantly obvious that the audio was dubbed over the original recording, if it was even recorded during the actual Donington show at all. When I watch a concert DVD, I fully expect to see and hear what I would have seen and heard if I had attended the concert. This experience however, was more like watching a bunch of MTV videos where the audio was from CD versions of the songs, but the video was showing concert footage. I contemplated giving it two stars instead of one because of Angus' high-energy performance, but the fact that I kept fast-forwarding to the next track during my initial viewing should tell you all you need to know.The bottom line is that I will most likely never pull this DVD out of the cabinet to watch it again for my own personal enjoyment. It will only ever see the light of day again if a friend still wants to see it even after the forewarning that I am sure to give."
2,How did Brian Johnson ever get the job?,"You will love every opening of each song. Everything is greatuntil Brian Johnson starts in. Man, if he would just speak thelyrics opposed to his attempt to sing, it would greatly improvethe DVD. If he wouldn't sing at all, I'd give it 4 stars. Angus& Malcolm are simply the best. I will listen to AC/DC with BonScot until the day I die. If you are going to order only oneAC/DC VHS/DVD, this is not it. If you have all the others, thenyes, you'll need to complete your collection with this one."
2,"Great Band, Not So Great Mix","I have been an AC/DC fan for as long as I can remember. The thing I love about those guys is they are who they are. They rock their way. I liked this DVD, but the mix wasn't what I had hoped it would be. You can hear the lead guitar and the snare drum above almost everything else. A little more balance would really improve the overall sound quality. I like the setting, just would have liked to hear all the music."
1,Overdubs SUCK!!,"Buy the VHS or Brazilian DVD version of Donington. They aren't overdubbed with other audio tracks. For instance, during Shoot to Thrill, Brian screams something, but his microphone is on his belt. During Back in Black. He says ""hey mama"" but his mike is no where near his mouth. One of the solos doesn't line up during Fire Your Guns. Thunderstruck even sounds different. There are lots of differences in the US DVD. I don't have time to name them all. The undoctored versions of the show also LOOK DIFFERENT. The show took place near a storm, but on the US DVD, there aren't any storm clouds. The sound is great, but its not from Donington. The original video and audio was fine. They should've left it alone. I strongly discourage the buying of this DVD. Buy the VHS or Brazilian DVD to get the full effect of the show."
4,"Nice, but...","I couldn't help but notice how great this DVD is, but... all of the songs sound way too much like the studio recordings.That is to say, the reason why I buy concert DVDs is to here a version of the song that different from the album version and to watch the band. In this one, you just get to watch the band. There's nothing different sounding.That's why I like, say, the Led Zeppelin DVD more than this one.I would've given this 3 stars, but Angus Young's hilarious strip-tease gave it another."
4,Live at the castle,"Good concert.. sound was to "" tinty "" sounding for me personally...saw blow up your video tour far better solos and sound...but it's a good concert.."
4,"Good concert, ok sound mix","I love watching the concert, lots of energy throughout, great songs, freakin AC/DC! My only complaint is the sound mix. I usually watch it with the 5.1 PCM version, and although it does sound good, the vocals are a little buried in the mix. The guitarists sound like they are sitting right next to you because they are panned left and right in the surround channels, which is pretty awesome, I just wish the vocals were up a bit more."
3,"Great DVD, except.....","I was jamming out to this DVD when it froze in the middle of ""Hells Bells"". It would not go any further. I tried it in all my DVD players and the same thing happened. I am getting a replacement, which is great, but it seems the manufacturers would watch the quality of DVD's they put out. Otherwise the music was great."
5,Play it loud,The Next Best thing to seeing them live. Make sure you turn your surround sound to ear bleading loud to really enjoy.
2,Disappointed,"I know that this concert was filmed back in 1991, and to compare it to more recent recordings that were made for HD isn't a fair comparison, but i doubt that there is much a difference from the regular DVD and the blu ray version. The footage is very grainy and when you see the shots from a distance it looks like every other pixel on the screen is a white dot. The sound is great(especially if you have a good theater system), but the video of this disk isn't up to what i'd expect for High Definition."
5,Blown Away,"This review will be simple and straight to the point.Call up some friends. Have them come over with beer and whiskey. Turn the stereo up to ten. Rock your flippin' brains out. This DVD performance is great.I was blown away. For close to two hours, AC/DC tore the stage apart. There was no down time. There were no ballads. This was hard rock from opening to closing.The audio is excellent The visuals are also excellent. This concert was well filmed and recorded.""Live at Donington"" sits proudly amongst my collection of live performance DVDs.Rock fans will not be disappointed. Buy this performance."
2,"Good Music, Poor Video","Gave this a two because of the songs. The video on this DVD is very poor. I don't even think that the sound is from the actual concert. If you watch everyone playing and listen to the sound, their movements don't match up with the music. I guess if you were going to order this, you'd want to get the Blu-ray so you'd at least have a better video (although I haven't seen the Blu-ray, I'd imagine it would be crisper). If you just want to listen to some songs, and see the band along with those songs, then get this DVD. If you want a realistic experience, skip this product."
5,This is the book to have.,Deke McClelland has an incredible video series on Adobe Photoshop and Sandee Cohen was with Adobe Systems for several years and first appeared in a multimedia presentation on the CD that came out with Illustrator 5.5 and she did a great series of demos showing off the new features.This book is the best one I've found on Adobe Illustrator - the information is presented in such a way that it's easy to find as well as thorough and complete.
1,For experienced users only I think,"Thats right, if you are a beginer, then I would try something else. I bought this book thinking that it would be perfect for me. As I'm an artist, I thought it would be easy to understand. This book is too brief. It doesnt explain the funtionality of any of the features enough. It tells you only how to get to them and do basics with them. I am going to have to return it. I bought this to improve my skills, but the directions are so poor that I could not get the job done with this book. I strongly suggest getting something else. When I discover it, I will post another message. Good luck, and sorry for negetive review, but Im just trying to save you the hassle that I had with this."
1,"""let me tell you about drawing software""","This book is much more of a dialog on drawing then it is useful. While parts were interesting, I found myself wanting some real substance _somewhere_ so I could actually apply something I had learned. Unfortunately, the authors instead find themselves telling funny little stories and jokes throughout the book, taking away from what little substance it has. Yet another disappointment...I would really like to find a good book on Illustrator, as the software has some great potential."
1,Little value,"For a hefty 600 page book on Illustrator, this book does little more than gloss over the features of Illustrator. Rarely is there a glimpse of supposed ""real world"" usage, as the title plainly screams at you. I'm quite upset I wasted my money on this book."
1,Don't believe the hype and save your $$,"Buy the Illustrator Classroom in a Book if you're a professional designer, or want to create designs and illustrations like a professional. If you want a career in clip art creation, then this might be the book for you. I've never seen such amateur artwork.Add on top of that the authors' cloying style which is both demeaning and seriously unfunny (but three cheers for trying, right??), and you've got a huge book that is a nightmare to plow through.Oh, and Sandee Cohen never worked for Adobe...that was Luanne Seymour Cohen, who has written the excellent Design Essentials book covering both Illustrator and Photoshop.It's too bad that Amazon doesn't let you preview a chapter...I doubt any copies of this book are being sold in real bookstores where you can actually pick up this ""work"" and leaf through it."
2,"A little light for a ""big"" book","The authors seem to gloss over a lot of Illustrator 9.0's features. I've been trying to use this as a reference book, but there are just too many things missing.Maybe they'll get it right for version 10.0, I like Deke's writing style."
1,They killed a tree for this?,"No CD. No color artwork. No ""professional"" artwork. Lots of clever banter. No real tips or tricks. This is closer to a parody book than a book on how to learn Illustrator.Very poor."
2,Save your money...nothing new,"Zoom club records claimed there was rare photos inside...there is not, oh there is but they are scaled down to less than 10 percent their original size. Also they claimed that the 2 bonus tracks on All Systems Go would be released here...they have been not. Get the two previous re-releases by Zoom Club (find them at KISSshop.com Amazon obviously doesnt give a damn about keeping them in stock) of Vinnie Vincents first two albums and pass this up.....its nothing new. The only difference is that the box set has the two ASG and Invasion albums with a colored label (instead of the original, cheap ""photocopied"" label).I bought this because I believed there to be actual life size photos in it...unfortunately I got ripped dont let the same thing happen to you. This is just Zoom Clubs last attempt to cash in on Vinnie's music."
1,This movie is brain damaged!!,"The following things were bad about this movie.. ""ACTING"" ..ok i dont expect any of the actors in a b-movie to get any nominations but, the acting here is porno bad! ""SETS & EFFECTS"" ..there werent many sets because the film takes place on a highway. That has me asking why the gas station that Ron Jeremy runs his car into looked like cardboard..? Other than that there where some unique effects. ""EDITING"" ..its hard to explain why some scenes were used but, I can only conclude that the editors were sure that no one would see the movie. ""STORY & SCRIPT"" ..more absurd than you could ever imagine. ""DIRECTION"" ..the director allowed all of the above to take place so enough said!! This is the last time I believe what I read on a dvd case as far as critic's praising a movie. There are about 5 quotes from different reveiwers.. none of them had I ever heard of and, now I know why."
2,B Horror Flick,"I got this in a pack of 4 DVDs for 5 bucks. Four college students pick up a hitchhiker who starts messing them up. They kill her and she comes back. Turns out there were 4 clones of her, all of whom meet their demise. It had some gore and nudity, but little else to recommend it."
3,Bruhn wanna-be,"This book is a collection of information and data that already exist in Bruhn. I ordered my book from the author before its general release and it came with 4 or 5 pages of errata with it. There are so many more errata I have found since then. I have found this book to be useful only for the methodology of its examples; otherwise, I go back to its source (Bruhn)."
3,collection of magazine articles,"This book is simply a collection of articles from the ""Vegetarian Journal"". I'm not saying that's a terrible thing, but just know that before you buy it. It was interesting to look through the first time, but I didn't really care for any of the recipes and I haven't opened it back up since the first time I read it."
5,Fun for the whole family,"These silly and irreverent sequels to some of Mother Goose's rhymes, written in language children will love, will leave family members of every age laughing. The accompanying illustrations are clever and humorous and add just the right touch. A wonderful book for everyone. I recommend it highly."
1,Not for Children,"This book has a few clever lines, but in general is unsuitable for young children. Violent, scary and gross themes abound."
1,Painful Pumps,"Loved these shoes but they hurt. Perfect heel height, great pattern in the leather and unusual silver/black pattern. But they really hurt my toes. I reluctantly returned them."
5,An extra dash of zest or authenticity,"Echoes from the Hills: A Defined Guide to Country Sayings by Roland Lee Netzer is an fun and informative guide which is packed cover to cover with colorful country phrases and their practical definitions. From ""A difference of opinion is what makes horse races"" meaning ""let's see who has the best idea by putting them to a test"" to ""Your mouth doesn't run on shutters, it runs on biscuit cutters,"" meaning ""shut up and eat; you talk too much"", Echoes from the Hills is an extraordinary guide to rural sayings and language which is especially recommended reading for ""city folk"" who need a brush-up on country lingo, as well as writers looking for an extra dash of zest or authenticity to add a rural dialogue."
4,DOES THE JOB........,"Bought this for my dog. He's got arthritis and joint pain, and thought the massage and deep heat would be benificial. Boy does he love it!!! You should hear the moans and groans of feeling totally relaxed...and see his eyes slowly close and tail wag like crazy. The attachements are wonderful. One for every area of your body. The heat is a nice bonus....but can only be used with 1 attachment. But that's OK.The only 2 things I found could have been better, is for the heat to be a little warmer or have 1 more higher setting. Same thing with the vibration. The LOW is almost useless....very little stimulation. It would be nice if they had low, medium and intense.But, for the price & free shipping me and my Dog Gus are well satisified."
3,Where's the heat?????,"The attachments are okay and the virator action is very soothing, but I'm disappointed with the heat feature, you can bearly feel any heat and it takes forever to heat up to that very minimal point. If you want to purchase this item, save your money and buy the 2 speed massager without the heat feature. You'll be paying for heat you can hardly feel."
2,Okay,"It has decent power. Any deep pressure will stop the vibrations, so it's pretty useless for deep tissue. The heating element doesn't get better the luke warm, not enough to penetrate the skin and do any real good. The attachments are nice and plentiful. The on/off switches are sensitive and in a lousy spot if you actually grasp the handle to work out your kinks and soreness, your hand will constantly hit the switch and accidentally turn it off."
3,Customereview,"The low setting is pretty mild. The high setting is pretty high-speed vibrations and would make a good sander - could probably do a good number on foot calluses with some adhesive sandpaper. Haven't tried the heat. Handle is too short for reaching your own back. For the price, it is great if it is what you want."
4,A very good one for the price,"It is a pretty useful massager and for the price it is worth trying !The heat is not pretty good, but overall a good one."
3,Wahl 2-Speed Hand-Held All-Body Massager with Heat,"It's good quality....but not exactly what I needed. That was my fault, not the massager. The low speed is hardly noticeable, the high speed is good and so is the heat. I'm in the gym 5 days a week and really needed something I could use to reach my back."
1,cheap,not powerful. top broke in half. not worth your money. does not do what it claims. i am looking for a good one so let me know if anybody has a better one im looking for something to help cellulite
4,does what it is supposed to,"this massager does not disappoint. the fast mode is strong enough wile the slow mode works on sensitive areas. The heating system is handy since it increases blood supply and comfort. The grip is also good, specially after 5 min of use. It comes with a large selection of ""tips"" which can adapt to your needs.On the negative side, the heating feature only works with the large pad, not the other smaller ones. And the buttons look a bit cheap, so these will be the first one to pop out.Otherwise great product."
4,Can't Live Without it!,"This is a great massager. Has plenty of power to soothe my aching muscles. The heat function works well but it takes a while to heat up. I turn the heat on for a few minutes before I start my massage so it is good and warm when I begin. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the motor is gone after only six months. It could be my fault because I use it every day (sometimes several times a day) for extended periods of time. That being said, I am buying another one because I can't live without it! Even if I have to buy one every few months, it is worth it.Wahl 2-Speed Hand-Held All-Body Massager with Heat: $25.00.Relief for my aching muscles: Priceless!"
3,You get what you pay for,It works ok but is kind of noisy and the heat only works with one of the attachments. It is slow to heat up.
1,worst masssager ever,worst item ever bought! barely massages and heats up nothing more to say bout it just dont waste your time and money with a pos like this
1,WEAK--WORTHLESS,WEAK wothless piece of cr*p like most the other new ones on the market --maybe the w/o the 1101 its a stronger model ordered it thru Walmart.com and ill take it back to their store
1,can't even hold it...,can't even hold this device...it's so fierce...then there's not one attachment which can be fitted to the head disc ...the head disc..doesn't come off and none of the parts attach at all..it's not what is shown..was really disappointed as the recommendations seenin the write ups... seemed all good
1,Returned it after one use,"Awful awful product.....I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, he is very athletic and always sore, I thought this will make him feel better. He hated it, I tried it to see if I like it(I don't like returning products) ..... gosh it was awful .... I returned it.....first item I have ever returned that I bought on Amazon."
4,Worked for massaging my Achilles Tendon,I bought this to massage other areas of my body and initially found it ineffective.Then I strained my Achilles tendon. I removed the default heater device and put on a little plastic knob on the massager and its been helping my tendon get better over the past week.So I dock it one star for the heater not being very effective.
5,Certified Massage Therapist,"Steady vibration is predictable and therefor, comforting to the client. Transition from superficial to deep tissue massage often starts with a warm preheat for relaxation of the general area. This tool is especially beneficial for tender areas and the bottoms of feet."
3,Good mini massager but very little heat,I bought this massager because I wanted both heat and massage; unfortunately Wahl only got half of the equation correct (the massage). After 20 minutes on high heat the metal disc only got slightly warm. On the other hand the massager is pretty impressive for an inexpensive massager. I won't be returning it but if I had to do it over again I would have purchased a different product.
5,definitely recommended,"Just wanted to echo the other reviewers. High setting gives good vigorous body massage. Low setting can be used for scalp or face. One note is that product not good for reaching to upper back - Homedics seems to have products better for that. The head assortment can also be useful, but not sure how important the heat option is. The best thing I found about the heat option is that I like that particular head best for body massage."
3,Doesn't work for me,"There are many great things about this product, so please read other reviews to see if those features are what you are looking for. I was drawn to this product because of the heat feature. Unfortunately, it never gets warm enough to do any good. You hardly notice it has warmed up at all. I also found that I didn't need all of the attachments. The main one is all I used. The biggest problem for me is the weight of the massager. I have pain in my hands and I found that the heavier weight of the massager caused me to end up not using it."
3,Okay,"Price is okay given the build quality. Feels durable and not cheap.Personally, I found it somewhat uncomfortable, as the level and pattern of vibration would cause a real itchy feeling on the skin, instead of actually massaging your muscles."
4,Mom loves it,"My mom has severe arthritis, and her doctor recommended she get a personal massager to help her on the days she doesn't go to physical therapy. She lives in a drafty basement apartment in New England, so I thought the heating element would be an added bonus. I gave her this for Christmas and she opened it up and started using it right away. It took a while to heat up the first time, and it doesn't get THAT hot (not hot enough to burn yourself, obviously), but it certainly helps her muscles warm up and relax. She only has uses the heat attachment - not the other ones - so far but for the price I paid, the value was well worth it."
4,wahl massager,"does good job little weak for me and gets hot if run for long ,if your really small person might work good"
5,whal,"I've tried several others to help relieve pain in my shoulders, and Whal 2 speed massager is the best one I've found."
2,Too loud,"We purchased this massager to replace the older model we had because it quit working. I wanted the same model we had and this seemed just like it except for the heated attachment. I liked the idea of the heated attachment, so I chose this one. Unfortunately this one is very loud and I could not enjoy it at all. It did not massage as well as the older model either, so we had to return it."
1,Giant piece of cheap-plastic-Chinese made crap.,"I'm not sure why this received so many great reviews. I paid more for this than others because I thought it would be good.Moments after first trying the regular head, I tried to replace it with another head. The instructions say ""with thumb and finger, pry off"". Well I tried and it was on very tight. So I tugged it until it pulled off....along with pulling out the inerds of the machine. The cheap plastic on the outside cracked.The head came off, but the connecter to the head was dangling outside the plastic.What a piece of horribly-made cheap plastic garbage.If you have a Wahl clibber, this must use the same motor because it has that horrible whining that the clippers has. The clippers at least are made somewhat solidly. This is junk.Not worth the price. Wahl probably makes it for $2 in China and sells the crap for $50. TOTAL RIPOFF.Not sure why so many good reviews. The heat is barely noticeable and the vibrations aren't that great."
2,The heating option is not worth this unit,"I had previously purchased the Wahl unit without the heating option and loved it. Based on the reviews and my experience with the similar unit, I purchased this one - not worth it. It works no better than the basic unit, just heavier and with a horrible heating option. Much happier with the basic model as it works great and is lighter."
5,Super Stimulator,"This massager really works, and it is dirt cheap! I am 82 and I get stimulations that make me feel, well, like I'm 60. Not bad. Think what it will do for a 40 year old!"
3,small yet effective,I like the different heads it comes with. The heating comes in really handy for muscles that are really tight. Great for easy reachable muscles.
2,You get what you pay for,"Inexpensive, yes. All those attachments are unnecessary--they don't change what the massager actually does. A bit heavier than I expected, too. Excellent delivery from Amazon, though."
5,Celebrating the people of Queens,"Excellent book -- tons of great restaurants, classic ethnic recipes to make when you get home, indexes by ethnicitiy and locale make places easy to find, explanations and introductions are interesting and informative. If you live in or will visit Queens, this is a great book to have."
2,Watch out for serious errors,"Was given this book in college to read over the summer. Addresses Christians with the mind set of separatism and asceticism. Realistically that's a limited audience, and what is needed more is a book that challenges Christians to be radical influences within the culture and still be set apart (but not a 'hermit'). My biggest problem with the book is that it is riddled with Open theism, aka God doesn't really know everything nor does he have power over any or everything. Very distracting from the main points of chapters. That pretty much destroyed his ethos for me.His section on technology was particularly weak (Check out ""Small is Beautiful"" by E.F. Schumacher instead). Overall, I would avoid this book."
1,Cowboys with Chrome Horses,"I was really disappointed with his book. It seems to be disconnected,like a collection of works by the author. Some things are repeated in different parts of the book. There is much unrelated information to dig thru to get at what the author says he is discussing. The layout makes it difficult to read, there are lots of typographical errors and mis-spellings, even of President Roosevelt's name. Save your money."
4,Inspirational,"A lovely little book about an amazing man. St. Francis was full of the joy and love of a true Christian; very much a follower of Christ in a dark time in history. I am a ""recovering Catholic"" and it is wonderful to be reminded that there have been some truly amazing people involved in the Catholic hierarchy."
5,A Beautiful Book on living like Saint Francis did.,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves Saint Francis and his way of life. I'd also recommend it to someone who doesn't even know who Saint Francis is, but would like to improve upon their spirituality and the quality of their life. John Michael Talbot goes over things like simplicity, solitude, joy, humility, creativity, chastity, compassion, peace and prayer. He gives examples of how Francis lived these things out and he also adds his, and others' wisdom on the topics. I also liked how he put in thought-provoking quotes from various people such as Buddha or St. Bonaventure. I found this book excellent and well worth the money. I know I'll always treasure it and reread it throughout my life. I'm sure it will help me in my walk with Christ and I'm sure it will do the same for you if you read it as well.God Bless,Neil"
1,Unrewarding,"I was expecting so much more based on the glorious reviews below but they totally missed the mark. Equivalent to a book report done by a 3rd grader with ADD, this has little to offer.Quotes seem misplaced and most stories go nowhere. I was hoping this would be more inspiring with USEABLE knowledge and not another pulpit for Christianity.Wayne Dyer has done a far better job using the teachings of ST Francis."
4,Nice blend of integration and integrity,"John-Michael Talbot manages to crystallise essential of Franciscan spirituality in a manner which makes it appealing and accessible for those in any state of life. Of particular note are his words about prayer, the practise of virtue, discretion and charity in dealing with others, and maintaining integrity without letting one's zeal exceed one's prudence."
5,Lessons of Sarint Francis,Well written book discussing prinicples guiding Francis of Assi's daily life. Excellent for personal spiritual growth or in an adult group discussion
5,The lessons of St. Francis,"This is a very pratical book, and it is very much aimed at how to bring simplicity and sprituality into a modern life."
5,Beautiful,I am not about religious man.But this is one good try to understand about simplicity and spirituality.That's true....
1,"Terrible written instructions, mediocre pictures","This is the worst origami book I have ever used (or in its case, attempted to use). The directions are horribly unclear; it seems that this author thinks that whatever she means, she can say ""open it to the top"". Four completely different folds she describes as opening it to the top. My, that's not helpful. Also, you just have to guess if valley or mountain folds are meant, because for both identical dashed lines are used and both are described as ""fold"". It's terribly confusing to have to make models just by looking at the pictures, when several folds can yield identical-looking results from the camera's angle, thus leaving the folder with all sorts of superfluous creases and frustration. In short, do not buy this book! I wouldn't even waste my time checking it out of the library."
3,"Mixed, but attracted, bag of origami models","This is a difficult book to review. It was one of the first origami books I got, and I ended up getting frustrated by it. Some of the models only work if your paper is the same color front and back, and some of them don't work without futzing not indicated in the directons. However, the book is very attractive and also has some great models. It's a good book, but not an origami classic"
2,Confusing instructions,"The instructions were so confusing I could not find myself creating an origami figure. Did not buy this book on Amazon, however, therefore, I have the luxury of returning it."
3,"Beautiful photographs, hard to follow","While the pictures and projects are beautiful, this book is not good for visual learners. Some of the steps will ask you to make a certain fold and when you do, the example in the next picture looks nothing like the what you just made. I am not new to origami, and I have to say this is the most difficult to follow design book I have ever used. I will keep it, and keep working on the designs, and it is a joy to look at. I would love to see these works and pictures, in a book that is better designed for visual learners."
2,Not quite origami,"I don`t think that this is a good origami book. For example, some of the models require glue or cutting which is a contradiction to the rules of origami. There are also some models that the author does not acknowledge to the original creators. But I would give some credit as the photographs were very clear. And for that I give it 2 stars. But overall I don`t think that this is quite a good book. Paper Folding? I don`t think so, More like paper cutting."
3,Beautiful shoe....runs big,"This shoe was really beautiful (dark brown) but I had to return it because the size runs approximately half size too big. I wear a larger shoe size and a half size smaller was not available therefore I was unable to order a replacement. For what it's worth, the shoes were comfortable during the brief time that I had them on my feet."
4,"Vintage Little Richard...sweat drops, throwing shoes....","The film and sound is to 1960's quality...but this is the show that Richard has given for years. If you have seen him anytime between 1965 and now, you will enjoy it....because you WILL relive that concert. The classic standing on the piano and throwing his jewelry, shoes....even his toga....to the screaming audience is here. His toga is covered with 1 inch square mirrors and makes Richard look like a moving disco ball!! The toga must weigh 5 or 6 pounds ...and out it goes into the audience!! Then Little Richard continues with audience members dancing with him on stage as he drips with sweat, his torso glistening with sweat... If you are a fan of the ""wild man of rock and roll""you will like it The length of the session is shorter than I expected Good vintage shots of 1960's peace movement type audience.(The same company that produced this dvd, has a Chuck Berry dvd at the same Peace Concert...)"
5,Hal Clement Award for Excellence in Young Adult SF,Each year the Golden Duck Committee selects 3 books to get recognition as the best in childrens science fiction. Alien Dreams won for best in Young Adult Science Fiction.
4,Almost perfect,"Finally! A domestically released Kool & the Gang collection, with great liner notes and most of the hits from both phases of their career. Disc 1 is the jazz/funk Kool & the Gang of the late 1960s and 1970s, and Disc 2 is the Pop/R&B/rock Kool & the Gang of the 1980s, with JT Taylor on vocals. Both discs are drastically different and serve to highlight the different phases of the band, similar to Fleetwood Mac. My only complaint is that there was enough time on both CDs to include certain songs that were left out, to have made the collection perfect. Those songs are ""Jones Vs. Jones,"" a bona-fide top 40 hit which was criminally neglected, and ""Holiday"" and ""Special Way,"" their last two hits, and perhaps even ""Steppin' Out,"" another minor hit. To have ended the CD with ""Holiday"" would have been awesome. Also, I wish they would have included the impossible-to-find single/radio mix of ""Cherish,"" which was the hit version...but other than that, it's great to finally have this."
4,A Decent Collection at a Decent Price,"Sure, the latter half of Disc 2 is pretty lame; but most of the rest is so great that we can agree not to speak of it... Like other releases in the ""Gold"" series, you get all the hits you need to own with good sound quality at a decent price."
1,I got raped!,"Man, I could pull a better book out of my ass! This book must be standard in the grade 1 ciriculum. It reminded me of a Dr. Suess book except it sucked way worse (is that possible?), there are no words that contain more than 4 letters and this review contains far more information than that book. I mean, Jesus was that bad. I haven't been bamboozled out of my money like this since the last time I was at the fair. Or was that a strip club? If your a slobbering idiot with too much money, buy this book. If you don't want to piss away your hard earned cabbage, buy another book."
5,Love it,"I was looking for a shrug/trap bar for a few weeks, just trying to decide on a perfect one. I already bought the Troy VTX 300LB weight set so I figured I'd spend the extra money and buy this bar made by Troy. It's quality matches the 300 pound set nicely. It's a very nice looking chrome bar with solid welds, doesn't look sloppy at all. The bar is actually different than whats pictured on Amazon. The bar has the raised handles AND also the regular flat handles. That was another plus for me. It also weighs a little over 50 pounds."
1,Yawn Fest,"I will give the intros, the first couple of chapters and the last chapter an interesting rating. The rest is a total Yawn Fest. I am selling my copy on eBay!"
1,Garbage In - Garbage Out.,"Another person trying to disprove something they don't want to beleive. Ovewhelming evidence proves that Jesus was crucified. Nothing in this book disproves it, because nothing in this book can stand on its own."
1,Fraud,"This book is fraud religion, fraud scholarship, and totally clueless. This author purports pure fantasy. Want to know the truth about religion? Spend time reading comparative religion, comparative mythology, archeology, history, rather than nonsense like this book. I recommend reading, The Jesus Mysteries, by Freke and Gandy, Joseph Campbell's works in audio, video and book forms, Robert Price's, Deconstructing Jesus, and a vast array of other authors sourced by these and many other authors. Oh, be sure to read, Unearthing the Bible, and find out what archeology says, now, today, with the most modern of techniques utilised, about the land of the Bible. Spend your money and time discovering truth, rather than the nonsense espoused in The Jesus Papers."
1,Bovine Scat...................,"at it's smelliest. The review above says ""....As a religious historian and a leading expert in the field of arcane knowledge, Baigent has unequaled access to hidden archives, secret societies, Masonic records, and the private collections of antiquities traders and their moneyed clients."" Does anyone really believe this? What an insult to our intelligence!I saw this clown on TV, completely staged for filming, with his dark glasses, leather (or imitation)jacket, long hair, and chain smoking cigarettes, and his pompous attitude. I almost fell out of my chair laughing, but gagging at the same time. He reminded me of a teenage motorcyle punk trying to be intelligent.I admit, I did NOT entirely read this book; I was tired of being sickened. If you pride yourself on your intelligence, do not read this book, or at least don't pay for it (I didn't). On the other hand, if you are a hate-mongering, anti-Christian, or atheist, have at it, it's right up your alley...."
1,The Jesus Paper's,I haven't read it yet. And probably won't right away cause i'm reading something else.
1,Old Wine In New Bottle (Unfortunately Watered-Down),"In what was billed as a stark challenge to our understanding of Jesus's life and death, as well as the treatment of these subjects by the Church, ""The Jesus Papers"" falls far short of even the most modest evidentiary standards, relying too much on supposition and speculation. Thankfully books of this nature need not provide 'lock-solid' proof of their claims to be interesting (or even entertaining) particularly when they are clearly intended to spark debate and confront assumptions which are themselves questionably valid. While Baigent seemingly writes with this end in mind, he ultimately disappoints providing instead a rambling, meandering summation of his theories that clings (barely) to its narrative structure. Save yourself the time and money and avoid a book all-too-conveniently produced to coattail off of the release of the blockbuster Da Vinci Code and buy Holy Blood, Holy Grail (by the same author) - a far more persuasive and moving read."
2,Disappointing based on previous offerings,"Michael Baigent is an expert and icon in his field. His breadth of reference is highly impressive and whilst there were some very interesting elements in this book, for me he rambled and spent an inordinate amount of time talking about the exploration of the caves around lake Avernus. I felt the book had been padded."
2,"The Jesus ""Capers"" is More Like it!","I am so disappointed because Baigent does nothing but rehash his old theories in a new updated bookcover! This book is a recap of Holy Blood, Holy Grail and the Messianic Legacy. Although the title is provocative enough, there is no further information afforded by reading the text. Like so many other authors who seek to lure us in with ""secret"" or ""arcane"" knowledge, there is nothing new! It's all hype - I'm tired of spending money and being duped into purchasing a book which is merely all a come-on! Grrr! I'll give it 2-stars because he does delve into the Egyptian connection to the teachings of Jesus. Other than that, I was hoping for more substance. Come on, Michael, we've heard the swoon theory a million times!! And, by the way, you never tell us ---just what are the Jesus Papers????"
3,simply my observation...,"I have not read the book as of yet but plan too [to enter my comment I was forced to rate the book].Interesting observation, if one looks up the Holy Bible there are at most 18 reviews and no arguing of historical accuracy. Just find it comical.Shell"
1,Supporting illusions...,"So continues on the scheme to deface and devalue Jesus Christ. I say if you have something to write about, put it on paper and back it up with some facts and sound theory. Everything else, highlighting this shabby attempt to further a mudslinging campaign, is a unthinkable strech of unsupported faith."
1,What people do for cash,"Books like this one are nothing new. The idea of Jesus having survived the crucifixion is hilarious for HISTORICAL reasons: If anyone knew how to EXECUTE a man in ancient times, it were the Romans. A very high profile ""criminal"" like Christ would not have been allowed to be taken down from the cross unless he was dead. Just give the Romans SOME credit!And Pilate making a deal to save Christ's life? Oh, for the love of GOD! (Pardon the pun) This is just RIDICULOUS!I don't mind theories and additional thoughts. But THIS is just hilarious!"
1,Horrible,"This book was the worst load of crock I have ever read. Unsupported facts, unsupported beliefs. It sounds to me like this man is on a witch-hunt to say everything written in the Bible is wrong. How much sense does that make??? Don't waste your money, instead read from credible resources like The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel. He does a good job of providing historical facts to the life, death and ressurection of Jesus."
1,The Jesus Paper.,"In regards to THE JESUS PAPER.By: Michael Baigent.Mr. Baigent:I read your book and WOW --- what a disappointment!It is full of conjectures, innuendos, and ( when the reader is led to believe that finally you were to present with a fact ), it was either lost, stolen, given to others, misplaced, even destroyed.I do not recommend this book to any other buyer. Heck, take the money and waste it on Powerball.Thanks,Tony G."
1,Interesting Hypothesis,"I am an open mindex reader. I was simply let down with what Professor Baigent had to offer. It wasn't until the final 20 pages of the book that he brings together the ""shocking"" details of the Jesus papers. With so little substance to back up the argument, I was left with an odd feeling at the end of the book. It was so speculative, I could never use his information in any kind of debate. I would be referencing documents that many believe exist. I did not mind the read and it is an interesting Egyptian section, but to call this book the Jesus Papers should tell me we are going to focus on those docuements. Thinking about this book, I almost feel like it was written to put pressure on the antiquities market to sell the remaining scrolls and documents."
1,Nothing new here.,"Warning warning Will Robinson! There is nothing new here! Our beloved author basically summarizes and remixes his earlier work Holy Blood Holy Grail like a DJ at an all night rave, which in it's self, was based mostly on conjecture and theories (the book not the rave).If you like money and would love to buy something for oh say $20 DO NOT buy this book. It is a total waste of time and paper... those poor trees.However on the overall idea of the book, I'd have to say it's a nice story and very inventive however the fact that it lacks a shred of any sort of corroborating evidence in it's self should be enough to help people decide that both Baigent's earlier work and Brown's funny novel are in no way true but simply works of fiction. However people will of course take these works to heart and we will be descended into chaos, dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!"
2,Hodge-podge of theories with not enogh time spent on any one of them,"Many of the ideas that Michael proposes in this work are interesting and seem reasonable but he doesn't follow through with nearly any of them. Even worse is that they don't seem to really relate to one another. Though perhaps that would be too easy (and certainly prove them untrue) if they did fit together like a tight little thriller puzzle.Unfortunately this book comes off as a well written (and sometimes exciting) hodge-podge of alternate histories of Jesus combined with sometimes unrelated global travels, promising meetings, and ancient secret digs. Maybe he will explore some of his theories further and spend more time writing about them soon."
1,Don't Bother,"Save your money. This could have been a fiction story for all we know. The ""evidence"" he provides are privately held documents that the author has ""seen"" and taken for granted that the owners told him the correct information about the papers as the author cannot read the papers that he has seen. All his ""evidence"" is totally anecdotal. The only other ""evidence"" is of a painting done in the 1600's or later as ""proof"" of a hoax.While his theory that Jesus lived after his crucifixion is interesting, he provides no proof except one interesting sentence in the original gospels.The Jesus Mysteries is a much better read and an incredibly scholarly book with dozens of pages of references."
2,Was not what I was expecting...,"The information in the book is interesting. Problem is that it doesn't have much to do with the topic at hand. The chapters (maybe 3 of them?) covering the topic were good.The material in the book seemed to be more about the history of the area Jesus inhabited rather than about how the Catholic Church is perpetrating a lie. I won't lie, I am a practicing Catholic, but I was really interested it what he had to say and what evidence he had to back it up. I don't, for a moment, think that what the Catholic Church teaches about Jesus is 100% correct. There is also the fact that there is a great deal of information about Jesus missing from Catholic teachings (from he was the age of 12 or so until he is in his late 20s is all but missing).I have about 2 chapters left and am greatly disappointed in this book. I borrowed this from my mom (not a practicing Catholic) and I think she was actually more disappointed in it than I was."
5,Re; Going the way of Zeus,"Historical Jesus or mythological Jesus, Michael Baigent does an excellent job at differentiating between the two with facts and intelligent speculative conclusions. As more and more ""newly"" discovered ancient manuscripts are revealed, the religious leaders are horrifed that their deceit is being slowly exposed for what it is. Baigent contributes to the ever growing evidence that if Jesus did exist, he was a man, nothing more, nothing less. The divinity of Jesus that was invented by the early church is a myth as much as the divinities of Zeus, Apollo, Mithra, or Chrisna. Jesus will certainly join these late great gods one day in the future. It is only a matter of time and thanks to Baigent and people like him, we can enjoy our wonderful life on earth instead of believing in fairy tales and waiting to die to experience happiness. ""The only gratification that science denies is deception"" - Carl Sagen."
2,Here We Go Again...,"Weren't HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL and THE MESSIANIC LEGACY enough for Michael Baigent?We get it Mike...You and Dan Brown and that crazy Starbird woman believe Jesus and Mary Magdalene were an item and they had a kid."
1,Pray for Mr. Baigent....,and anyone who believes in what he has written in this book. It takes more faith to believe in his theories and ideas than it does to believe in in Christ and that he rose from the dead.
2,boring,"I started reading this book with an open mind and quite interested in the topic. There are alot of things in the bible that trouble me. This book troubles me also. It leaves you with more questions than answers and becomes very boring and hard to follow by the middle of it. That's when I put it down and didn't pick it back up. Maybe if I had read to the end I would of been more impressed. Maybe Dan Brown will write a fictional novel based on this book too, and it will be a blockbuster."
1,"Isn't this ""theory"" gibberish getting old by now?","No, I'm not going to dignify this by elaborating further. This is just a link in the chain of (giggle) ""historial fiction"" that currently accounts for DaVinci Code, etc. It's all been said before, Michael. HO-hum...."
1,A search for profit,"It has come to my attention that, although this book obviously has very few objective truths, or anything beyond conjecture really, it continues to attract readers. While I can understand wanting to read an intellectual work before judging it, in this case, that is unneccessary. There is very little representative of intellect in these arguments, and by purchasing it merely to disprove it, one would only fuel this man's lies. By putting cash in his pocket for spouting out mistruths, we are perpetuating and, indeed, encouraging this sort of book. Save yourself some money and say ""no"" to misguided works like this that broker upon their controversiality to make an easy profit."
3,Junk Journalism,"This is really junk journalism. The author jumps to conclusions to support arguments without creating a foundation. There are some valid historical points, but frankly leaps of faith to prove his arguments. It is worth a read for conspiracy theory buffs but other than that isn't much in the way of research."
1,The jesus papers,"Mr. Baigent is obviously a kook. Just one more attempt to discredit the gospels, written by men who ACTUALLY were there and witnessed the crucifixion. This kind of writing is right along the lines of those who say the Holocaust never happened.Don't waste you hard earned money on this collection of rhetoric bologna. This type of slash fest also has one good end result. It proves what the bible says about those who will always try to distort, discredit, and twist what the Word says. And for that, we thank Mr. Baigent. This is a foolish piece of rubish not worth the read. From the first page to the last, nothing but garbage."
4,This man is just obsessed with Jesus.,"Our author is so enchanted by his own thoughts about Jesus that fundamental research, reading, and proven scholarship sit under his nose unseen. Kind of like J.M.Allegro with his book ""Sacred Mushroom and the Cross."" You have to love these guys for stirring the pot. WOW, these men just can not stop thinking about Jesus. Me, either. But if you want to stand solid ground you need to read some more. Follow up with Justin Martyr's ""Dialogue with Trypha"" a very elaborate proof that Jesus is the Christ and the Messiah. Then if you want more check out the work of Ernst Van Doschutz and Hermann Freiherr Von Soden who wrote until 1914.For a really quick fix try out the Coptic Church in Egypt web site. They have a line of popes through the laying on of hands from the time the apostle Mark was there approx 50 AD. Pray for us Saint Pachomius."
4,HBHG Lite plus a bit more,"If you've read Holy Blood Holy Grail you will be familiar with the first 2/3rds of the book....although if it's been some time since you read HBHG the review is good. The ""Jesus Papers"" themselves are intriguing, but (surprise) cannot be substantiated beyond Baigent's word. He does assemble the usual collection of collateral data to support the idea that Jesus survived the Cross...plus some of which was new to me.I wouldn't call it the ""Greatest Cover-Up in History"", reserving that appellation for the events of 1947."
2,Baigent Wants Our Bucks,"I read Holy Blood Holy Grail years ago and re-read it later. I found it quite interesting. I have to agree with the reviewer ""Pen Name"". Baigent himself is now on the DaVinci Code bandwagon.Let us not forget, Holy Blood, Holy Grail was released as a work of non-fiction, while Dan Brown wrote his as fiction (very well, I might add, it was a great book). It is ridiculous that Baigent is suing Dan Brown for ""stealing"" his ideas. He should also be suing all the others who wrote books on this subject. I guess he thinks Brown has more money than the others.Personally, I feel that Baigent and his co-author fitted their unsubstaniated findings and some ideas taken from the Masons (both are Masons).This is not to say it was not a very interesting book and an interesting theory, however it is very difficult to trace a specific idea from the present to 2000 years ago."
2,Interesting title Half deceiving content,"I was appealed by the title in a bargain price of a bookstore and I thought it could have been an interesting reading after books from Elaine Pagels about gnostic gospels. The first 8 chapters are the most pertinent to the title and give some historical context of Jesus' life and of spread of early Christianity in first two centuries BC, mostly from Josephus, other Roman historians and gnostic gospels. After this, the author digresses on mysticism and finally goes back to Nag Hammadi and Dead Sea Scrolls, supporting the destabilizing influence of these on some principles of Christianism. Sometimes the author tries to give evidence to some of his hypothesis by stretching too much the relevance of archeo findings or of some excerpts of texts mentioned above. Surely provoking and revealing for readers that approach gnostic gospels for first time. Teh book could have been long half its actual length."
2,Nothing exposed here...,"Although this book provides some interesting information about archeology and the workings of the black market in dealing with ancient artifacts, there is absolutely nothing new revealed in this book.At the very most, after teasing readers throughout the book with the revelations to come, in the last few pages Baigent claims he saw a document, which he could not translate, but that supposedly exposes history's greatest coverup. Huh? What am I missing here? Don't you have to be able to read and understand a document to know what message it reveals?I would advise you that if you're really interested in the type of information this book purports to reveal, read any of Elaine Pagel's books. This one is a waste of time and money."
1,Specious analysis,"I read this book because it was selected by our book discussion group. I thought the authors' ""analysis"" was unbalanced in that, for each ""lie"", they included only those points to analyze that permitted them to support the conclusion they wanted. For example, under the ""lie"" of ""Religion and Politics Don't Mix"" they failed to discuss the efforts (and success) of the religious right to influence the content of school textbooks or to require the teaching of creationism along with, or in place of, evolution. This book is clearly an attempt to support pre-determined positions rather than an analysis of some very important issues. Our book group, including the conservatives (Republicans), agreed the book was not well written and a poor choice for discussion."
2,Insulting to those who actually follow politics,"If you follow politics, you'll find their writing and the ""lies"" they dispel, such as ""All Politicians Are Corrupt,"" to be condescending and insulting.They present evidence irresponsibly, such as charting projected Medicare spendings in the future and failing to mention whether or not the dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation.It is apparent that the target audience here is those that have an obscured and cynical view of Washington."
5,A Book to Share,"I agree with every good thing said about this book in the eight Amazon readers' reviews below. I have read a great many of the books about our planetary crisis over the years. In terms of impact per page, I think this is the best yet. In just a bit over 200 pages it portrays the threats, the driving forces that underlie them, the transitions needed in our society if we are to overcome them, and a great variety of approaches to producing those transitions. It is compellingly urgent and at the same time pragmatically hopeful.I'm going to buy multiple copies and send them to friends and relations who need to read it!"
5,Beyond interesting,"Seeing the front pages from around the country was very interesting. The ones that got nasty and used words like Bastard where the most interesting. Must have book about 9/11. But be sure you know before you buy, this just has FRONT PAGES of newspapers, no stories."
4,A good resource to remember this horrific day,"An interesting concept for a book. Filled with color copies of newspaper front pages the day after the 9-11 attacks. Clearly photos got repeated, however it is especially interesting to see what angle different papers saw the event from. Some seemed to be breathless printing single photos. Others seemed very opinionated and ready for something bigger. Some seemed to be caught flat footed and editors were at a loss.A moving book related to one of the biggest single attacks on our country (if not the biggest).I remember that morning having my 6 and 10 year old sons watch the TV to see events unfold. I explained to them that this was the Pearl Harbor of our generations. Along with a couple of other books that I own, this is a book to remember that horrific day."
4,A moving collection,"A very good collection of newspaper front pages from across America on that fateful day and those that followed. Will appeal to more than just journalists and newspaper buffs. Many of the pages, photos and headlines are gripping, and will remind many just how awful those first days after the attacks were. Good, bare-bones presentation marred only by sub-par reproduction of a handful of pages."
4,PHOTOGRAPHS FROM MAJOR NEWSPAPERS AROUND THE WORLD,"While this book does contain some good photographs from newspapers around the world in regard to the horrific events of September 11, 2001, I found the book did not have the quality of other books published to date. This book is in paperback, not hardcover, which will not be nearly as durable if you are purchasing the book as a keepsake to hand down to future generations. The book is well organized and has some very good photographs but it would not be my first choice. I would recommend ""New York September 11"" with photographs by Magnum Photographers before this one.On the plus side, proceeds from the book will go to the September 11 Fund administered by the United Way, but it does not say what percentage, if any, of the funds will be used for administrative costs. Readers my want to review other books before purchasing this one and, if they so choose, give directly to the September 11 Fund through a direct donation."
2,gansters,ok rather boring gangster movies. Just not great movies and I wouldn't buy them again. I usually like this kind of movie but not these.
3,Great Intro,"I'm in total agreement with Amazon's reviewer save for a few things compilers could have done better. The inclusion of the group's 1965 single ""Go Now"" should - by all rights - have been included. ""Cities"", a beautiful and rare single that was only available on the boxed set should also have been in the running order. Lastly, someone should fix the listings for Disc 2. Both songs were by The Blues Jays, i.e. John Lodge and Justin Hayward. Sound: great. Liner notes: great. As an introduction to the band: 8/10."
2,Poor sound quality,"The songs in this collection are well chosen, but the first hint of trouble comes when you pop disc 1 in the player and your display says Nights In White Satin is 4 1/2 minutes long. Yes, they cut the entire ""Breathe deep the gathering gloom..."" part. Come on guys, you have 2 entire CDs to fill, don't edit the band's debatably greatest song.But the big problem is the sound quality. It's ok if not wonderful on disc 2, but all of disc 1, which is where most of the primo material resides, sounds compressed and hashy. The original Deram CDs made in the 1980s sound much cleaner, and they were made with relatively primitive equipment.This collection is ok to throw into a car stereo, but it wasn't made for people who love this music."
4,Polydor Gets Closer To A Definitive MB Compilation...,"...but no cigar just yet. There's still Blue Jays/Justin Hayward solo stuff here, robbing this otherwise great anthology of disc space which could be used for, say, interesting album tracks from ""Prelude"". On the plus side, ""Go Now"" is gone (that's really a song from a different group, according to Graeme), and there are songs from ""Strange Times"" and ""December"", bringing the Moody Blues ""Anthology"" up to date. Also included is the the timeless ""Had To Fall In Love"" from ""Octave"", the most underrated of Justin's love songs.In conclusion, although not ideal this is the first Moodies collection that I'd take to a desert island if so exiled."
5,Good music!,I needed to replace a long lost CD and after seeing them in concert recently I had to replace it! My 19-year old daughter loves them also! Ageless classics!
4,Most Moody Blues for the Buck!,"Timothy Leary's dead, No but I know he's on this record! Kinda grew away from the blues a long time ago. But I got most every thing I wanted and some I couldn't care much for. Great Buy for he price."
4,Pretty Fine!!!,"This is a pretty fine collection of Moody Blues songs! While it may not be PERFECT, at least for some fans, it is pretty close. A must have for the casual fan, as it includes a very good assortment of all their work, along with their biggest hits. We thought it sounds pretty good; there might be a little room for a slight bit of sound or editing improvement on a few songs, but this CD certainly sounds better than our old LP's. If you were to only have one MB CD, this would be it. We're glad we purchased it, bet you will be too!"
2,Content Great Quality Not So.,"I bought this Double Disc due to the Excellent selection of nearly all my favorite Moody Tunes. However, once I put it in my player, I was quickly disappointed. Not sure if this has to do with the fact that it's a Greatest Hits Duo, or if it's just badly made...Or both. I rarely buy 'Greatest Hits' for the simple fact that they always seem to pale in comparison quality wise. On these two discs the sound quality is horrible. It hisses, is unclear on certain cuts and goes in and out making me need to adjust the sound/volume every few songs..I would recommend it solely based on the song selection, but if you are a sound expert and picky about the quality of what you put into your ears, perhaps it would be a better investment to buy a few better Moody Blues CD's and make your own playlist."
4,Very Nice Collection,"I am overall very pleased with this purchase, the audio quality is very good, which is not to say I'm dissapointed but I think it could have been just slightly better. Song selection covers nearly all my wants, some of the newer titles could have been left off for more early-middle material, but that is not to say this wasn't worth the price, it was. I find most of the Gold series to be quite good."

2,Misleading,"So, the book features seven secret origins. One is of the new incarnation of the JLA, and the other six feature the more prominent members of its roster.Grant Morrison writes the story of the actual JLA, and that's it. Mark Waid writes The Flash's origin story, but the other five are written (poorly) by no name talent.Morrison and Waid's stories are great, but not enough to warrant spending this much on the book."
3,good,"this cd is good, i like most of the bands, but i was really looking for a song from the end of the game. when it has the film of all the real skaters theres a song playing that goes something like ""everybody is somebody in LA"". and it says LA over and over. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHAT THAT SONG IS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!! kel_shmel333@hotmail.com"
3,I wouldnt buy it // But its good,"Was pretty sketchy about this release. after hearing this i changed my mind about this. all the bands do such a gret job. Fall Out Boy does a great cover of Gorilla Biscuits - Start Today, Rise Against was great with Black Flags - Fix Me, If you seen Lords Of Dogtown then you know they can pull off Black Flag (Ok at least I think they can), Taking Back Sunday doing Descendants was great... but i wouldnt have bought this record, im glad i got to listen to it. yes its great but nothing i would buy.."
4,Get Over It,"What I have heard of this CD is not not--if your into the type of music that these bands put out. If your looking for a ""true"" punk or emo or hardcore CD....your going to need to go back to the 70's & late 80's because they do not exist anymore. Plus anyway, is the label really all that important or is it about the music?"
3,Thought it was a cool idea...,"It's nice to hear some of these songs done by some of the more popular bands of today. For some reason people have a problem with bands doing straight up covers of old punk songs and not giving it there own interpetation, but I didn't think that was a cover. I thought that was just redoing a song in your own way. A cover is paying tribute to the band who originally wrote the song -- not trying to out-do the original. Whenever I hear a cover at a show, I don't hear anything so different to say, ""Wow, that was such a great take on that song!!"" There's a reason. They're old punk songs, so all you so called old punk fans (which would make you at least 30 plus a few years, so if you're complaining about the interpertation of the cover than you're just lost in your years...) should just can it because they weren't the most complex symphonies of all time, they were just what they were. Simple and fun."
3,most of the well known bands..,"after i bought the game i was totally amped for th soundtrack (there is a crapload of awesome metal and punk in the game) but when i looked at the tracklist i was like wtf? WHERE IS DFA1979???ARGthis should definately have been at least two discs with the massive collection of songs found in the game. i suppose it has mcr, fob, ra and fata but.. what about the metal? and i dont even like the hiphop but i would have liked to seeit included.my final say: NEED MORE TUNEAGE. DONT BUY. well unless you only like those songs then fill yer boots. props for the clash ripoff cover though"
1,I HATE THIS,"why did they have to do this! they ruined some real good punk songs, some classics, and had emo bands cover them. THIS IS A SHAME TO PUNK. this soundtrack made me cry. its such a disgrace. WHY DID YOU DO THIS MR TONY HAWK. WHY?!?!?!?!?!"
1,Killing Classics Should Be A Felony,"This is complete and utter garbage. Today's trendy garbage bands have taken amazing songs from our punk rock for-fathers and desecrated them. Saves The Day covering Sonic Reducer makes me want to vomit just like Chris Connelly. The only highlight on the whole record is My Chemical Romance's cover of The Misfits song Astro Zombies. Even Glenn Danzig himself said it was pretty good at the recent Danzig show I attended. Other than that, complete and utter garbage."
3,Three stars might be generous,"Why is the cover like London Calling when there isn't a Clash song on here?Anyway, overall, this album is not very good, mainly due to so many new bands being bad, but there are some decent songs. Those decent songs are ""Fallen in Love"", ""Institutionalized"", and ""Suburban Home"". And even though I don't particuarly care for My Chemical Romance, their cover of ""Astro Zombies"" isn't half bad. Other than that, the tracks are mediocre to bad. The bad being Fall Out Boy.So instead of buying the album, I would just download those few good songs."
3,3 stars for Descendents cover.,"So most covers seem to be really bad. So most of the bands on this cd suck, with the exception of a few. Now, I am a big Descendents fan, and I have never heard a better Descendents cover than Taking Back Sunday covering Suburban Home and I Like Food. I don't really like Taking Back Sunday, a little too poppy for my tastes. But have any of you listened to their cover? Makes me wish the Descendents would release a cd with new versions of all their songs, somewhat like the Queers did with Summer Hits.3 stars for Descendents cover only. Don't buy this. Just download the Taking Back Sunday cover. Trust me, it won't suck."
1,Like someone under me said...UTTER TRASH!!,"Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT buy this garbage!! All it is is a marketing ploy by the makers of Tony Hawk to make punk rock seem ""cool"" and ""trendy"" to a mainstream audience by having crappy, modern, POP bands cover these hardcore classics!! Don't buy this album, if you want to get into punk rock by the albums by the original artists, don't support that greedy, corporate motherf*cker, TONY HAWK!"
1,Tens of millions of copies sold world wide?,"That editorial review is full of crap. While the games 'Tony Hawk's Underground' and its sequel sold very well, they did not sell 'tens of millions of copies world wide'. Now for this album: its pure trash. What could have been an awesome soundtrack full of awesome 80's punk bands is just some crappy emo bands covering punk classics. Skip this trash."
5,Ignore the others,"Being someone who has never played the game before (but wants to), I think that the Tony Hawk's American Wasteland sondtrack is pretty good, with a couple of slightly rough edges. I approve of the idea of having modern hardcore bands do older punk songs, as most of them did a fairly respectable job. My favorite tracks on the album are ""Astro Zombies"" (My Chemical Romance), ""Wash Away"" (Alkaline Trio), ""Suburban Home/I Like Food"" (Taking Back Sunday), and ""Ever Fallen In Love"" (Thursday), since they all do good jobs at remaining loyal to the originals but still adding their own little twists. [I don't think that these bands are THAT mainstream, compared to a lot of bands (***cough**greenday**cough***), except for Fall Out Boy]. So, yeah, unless you're already prejudiced against the bands on the album like a lot of the poeple that reviewed this album on Amazon, or if you just don't like punk, I would definitely suggest this album."
4,good bands+good songs=great album,"This album was really brilliant, living up to the standards of the other bands who actually wrote the songs. Some of the songs may even be better than the originals, but thats my opinion. And for some people who wasted their time badmouthing one of the greatest skaters alive and this CD, thats a stupid thing to do. Watch t.v. or something. Leave it for the people who have better things to say. Really.I especially liked ""Search and Destroy"", ""Ever Fallen In Love"", ""Astro Zombies"", and ""Start Today"".If you haven't listened to this album, do so. I didnt buy the album so do what I did, either let a friend burn it for you, or download the good songs from a website for cheaper."
1,just plain bad,"Personally, I don't mind most of the bands on this album, when they do their own stuff. These covers are the worst covers I have ever heard. They are devoid of anything that makes them worthwhile for covers. The bands all tune their guitars to sound like the originals but they don't have the standout voices that the originals had. The only exceptions are the Dropkick Murphys and Hot Snakes. Those two make this album worthy of one star. Personally I like Alkaline Trio, Saves the Day and several others on this cd, but they don't understand that a cover is supposed to be your sound and interpretation of the song. Let's face it, the original musicality of these bands was fairly low. The things that made them stand out were the fact that this was a new kind of music and they all had such interesting vocals. These covers use the same music that these guys used twenty years ago with throwaway vocals."
4,Glass on a vacation from glass,"Foday Musa Suso, esteemed African composer, had a great role in co-composing this music. What he & Glass did was literally work on each line of music together, writing a note or a few notes before the other had his turn at it. The result is something they were both very pleased with & which neither could have composed on his own. The work is brimming with Glass's repeated figures, but it's not music you might expect from him. Exotic, dry, often ethereal, it'll coat your dreams at night with a fine white sand."
4,Delicate and ephemeral,"This score composed by Glass and Suso was written for a production of The Screens at the Guthrie theater in Minneapolis in 1989. The play takes place in 1960s Algeria during a struggle for independence from France. This is an excellent collaboration for Glass, but there are a couple of Suso's contributions I could live without. For me Glass's The French Lieutenant's Dream is the highlight of the CD. Like most of the composition it is delicate and ephemeral. Good quality headphones are recommended here, as should be with most of Glass's work now that I think of it. The Screens is Jean Genet's finest stage work and was first seen in Paris in 1966."
5,Quality player,"HD-DVD is history now. That being said, I own a few discs and, for the price, I can't complain about this player.Well all know that Toshiba got spanked in the format war. Let the name-calling adolescents argue that one out on the DVD forums. I'm merely saying it truly IS a good product. So, if you've invested in some HD-DVD discs you might want to consider picking up this player, considering the incredible price drop."
5,Best 360 peripheral you can buy,"Well, having had a PS3 and doing the blu ray scene for a while I decided to pick up this player and try out HD DVD (Most of my favorite movies are on HD DVD and pretty much all my all time favorites are owned by Universal). This player is quick and easy to setup, and adds relief to those who worry about over-using the DVD drive inside the 360 itself. Its quiet and loads quickly. My only compaint is that the color doesnt match my green Xbox 360."
2,Too noisy with the 360,"The HD DVD player is not noisy at all, but the XBOX 360 is WAY too loud and it seems as though the 360 has to stay on while the dvd player is running. Too bad because I really wanted this to work. I have a fall 2007 XBOX 360 Premium with HDMI."
1,buy it somewhere else,"This is a great product. It offers a media center extender, makes regular DVD's look better, adds an extra USB slot, and works seemlessly with the 360 console. BUT... If your buying this from AMAZON in hopes of getting the free movies that they say you get, I wouldn't count on it. I ordered this ONLY because of the offer. I got it in the mail and when I tried to get the free movies they stopped the offer. Now after I got sent to Iraq and can't do anything about it they re-offer the deal and won't re- extend the offer to me. I got screwed and this isn't the first time that offers had been taken back by this site from me. I serve in Germany and depend on AMAZON to get a lot of the things that I just can't get there, I guess I might have to find somewhere else to get things that I need for the next three years."
1,HD-DVD is OBSOLETE,"Why would you buy a player that uses an out of date format? Maybe cause its $50. Microsoft is making a blu-ray add on now, so if you plan to watch alot of HD movies on your 360 you might want to wait."
1,should be built into the system,"its a great addition to the system but i do have a few bones to pick:1. it isnt built into the system. this is bad because there are wires and stuff to mess with. it adds size o an already pretty big system. it wasnt the easiest thing to hook up either.2. there arent many good hd movies out there. i am not a fanboy but the blue ray has better movies. they both look great though.3. pricey. getting this bumps up the price to the ps3 price level.so in conclusion, it would be great if this was built into the system."
4,Still A Steal,"I purchased this a few months ago when it went to the $50 disco price. Excellent upconverting DVD player, plus you can still enjoy a gorgeous HD picture from any HD-DVDs you come across (Blu Ray or not, it's still High Definition!). Highly recommended for any 360 owners looking for a primary or secondary DVD player or for those who still have an adequate HD-DVD collection (growing everytime I find cheap HD-DVDs)."
4,"great picture, lousy sound","bought this so i could watch hd-dvd's in my gameroom. while the piture quality is phenomenal, the sound will leave you wanting more. sound output seems very compressed, this forces you to crank your surround sound receiver to higher than normal levels just to hear what's going on. if you own a 360 then buy this, but if you want a good hd-dvd player tnat's serious about the audio, then i would look elsewhere."
4,Great player...one REALLY DUMB mistake,"This HD-DVD player is a great value. For $200, it can't be beat. Quality of picture, is great, even though its not HDMI. Component is fine. OK, heres the dumbest aspect I cannot believe. THERE IS NO SLOW MOTION PLAYBACK! At all! You can freeze frame, fast forward, etc. No slo-mo. Absolutely ridiculous for a state of the art, next generation DVD player. Not mentioned at all in instruction manual, tried every combo of buttons and finally called Xbox 360 support. The person I spoke to put me on hold multiple times, and was completely stumped. Asked me if read the instructions ( of course i did. No mention of slow playback in their anywhere), and then said I should keep on pressing the fast forward button. I told her I tried that, and it doesn't work. So yeah, if you ever want to watch an action scene in slow motion , forget it. Too stupid."
4,50.00 giveaway,when blue-ray prices drop ill think about it for now there enough hddvd to keep me happy.for 50.00 iam a happy camper
4,Watch your TV!!!,"Overall, the product is great and easy to use, however, check your TV first. I say this because xbox claims to be able to put out 1080p. While this may be true, not many TV's have a 1080p input that is not HDMI. I have what I would consider to be a high end TV. It's a Sony Bravia 46"" LCD. The TV will play up to 1080p, but only on HDMI inputs, which is not available currently on the 360."
3,have some loading problems sometimes,i bought some hd movie/ audio disk that wont play. but they others play fine. i am afraid to buy more and the same thing happens again.
3,Blueray won the HiDef war 2 days after I bought it.,What can I say? It does play regular DVDs well so I guess it isn't a total loss. Still haven't gotten the 5 free HD DVDs that were part of the deal 2+ months later.
1,Microsoft makes garbage? Who knew. . .,"I purchased a new 360 HD DVD player a month and 10 days ago and it stands as a doorstop today. Microsoft refuses to provide the warranty work on it so I have an ag complaint on them over it. These devices have a very high defect rate, similar to the first generation of the 360 system. Microsoft has discontinued it and doesn't want to service them anymore. Their customer service is provided by the notorious collections agency, NCO, which spells customer service nightmare. Hopefully if you buy one of these, it will not become a pricey paperweight like mine has."
3,it works,"I think it's safe to say that HD DVD is crusing down Betamax road, but with all the free HD DVD discs that Amazon gave me I thought it would be a nice add-on to my XBOX so I can include HD DVDs in my Netflix account (The Bournes and Matrixs are worth it alone). I have a Blu-Ray player too, and I can't see any reason why one is better than the other (my TV is a 42 inch 1080p LCD, and my reciever does 5.1). Looking at sales figures and titles released, I'd have to say Blu-Ray is winning this format war, but at $180 with 8 free HD DVDs, I'm going with both. I doubt I will ever buy any HD DVDs, but Netflix has a good selection for renting.Update: I should remark that if you use Component input, you will only get 1080 interlace (not 1080 progressive). This is of course disapointing if your tv (like mine) will display 1080p. Oh well. I guess I'll have to buy more HDMI cables."
3,more of a status symbol unless you are a real movie freak,"Many people will be greatly tempted to get into an Xbox 360 just to have add on a ""low cost"" HD-DVD player. Those that already have a 360 will be even more tempted. But, if all you want is to get into HD-DVD movies, my advise would be to buy the Toshiba HD-A2 ($499 list) and subscribe to Netflix or Blockbuster. Sure, a standalone player will cost much more, but still cheaper when you factor in cost of an Xbox 360 game console."
1,YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!,I WILL MAKE THIS SHORT....IT DOES NOT PLAY ALL HD DVD'S.........BOUGHT THIS AND KING KONG LOOKS GREAT.....HOWEVER IT DOES NOT READ MY NEW STAR TREK HD DVD.........IT READS THE STANDARD SIDE JUST FINE....FLIP IT TO THE HD SIDE AND IT SIMPLY SAYS READING FOR EVER.........I WISH THERE WAS A LIST OUT THERE OF WHAT THIS PLAYER CAN AND CAN NOT READ.*****ADDED THIS TO REVIEW-FOUND OUT THAT THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE STAR TREK DVD'S AND NOT IN THE PLAYER*******IF I WERE ABLE TO MAKE THIS PURCHASE AGAIN I WOULD NOT*********AFTER RESEARCHING WHICH I SHOULD HAVE DONE FROM THE BEGINING ...I'D RATHER PURCHASE A FULLY DEVOTED HD DVD PLAYER INSTEAD.....PRICES HAVE DROPPED AND THIS XBOX PLAYER IS NO LONGER SUCH A GREAT DEAL OR GOOD DEAL FOR THAT MATTER******HOPE THIS REVIEW IS HELPFUL TO SOMEONE OUT THERE.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I got this player for Christmas and have only used it twice, and it's ALREADY BROKEN. It won't read any discs at all. Not only that, but now I find out that it isn't capable of true 1080p output?? What a piece of junk... Buyer beware!"
2,Too high a cost and not worth it...,"I've had this since the day it came out and I can say I'm not impressed with the product. When playing King Kong I noticed that durring any rapid motion you could see jagged lines on the moving object (people, Kong), that and the fact you got the 360s fan noise to contend with (which seems alot louder when playing HD DVDs than regular DVDs)I only really suggest getting this if you really dont want to shell out big bucks on a standalone HD DVD player then this is your product, as for quality it was nice to have the extra USB ports (nice if you have wireless adapter). But if you also own a PS3 I suggest using it's blue ray player, personally I like it alot better not only because it's quiet but it also is better looking with no jagged lines. And the funny thing is the games were supposed to be hi-def, but how can you get hi-def with only a plain DVD rom as your game drive?"
3,I stop using it.,"After I got my Playstation 3, I've not even turned on my X-Box 360 for any reason at all. Not even to watch my HD DVDs. Why should I when I got Blu-Ray drive in my PS3. So if you plan on get a Playstation 3, don't even bother with this. I also hate the fact that it is a external drive."
1,NO HDMI = LAME,"Firstly this thing is huge, it's ugly, and it's a waste of money since it doesn't support HDMI. If your 360 dies, so does your ability to play movies. Well and it's tied to your 360, meaning in 3-4 years it's just a piece of junk you'll try to pawn off for $10 on someone taking a $190 loss.You're better off waiting a few months and getting a ""combo"" drive which will play HD-DVD and BlueRay. And one that will be around in 10 years.But seriously, no HDMI is a HUGE deal movie studios can program discs to display at lower resolution when displayed via component-video outputs, which could render the Xbox 360 HD-DVD drive almost useless for many consumers.And if you don't think they will do this, look what the MPAA and RIAA have done to consumers over the years."
1,Horrible add-on,"** Update, Timewarner just went Bluray exclusive, likely the format war is over, invest in a PS3 or a Bluray player, instead of an expensive addon that will be obsolete in weeks.Not sure why would anyone buy this $200 external add-on with the annoying cables ...etc. to watch an HD standard supported by less than 30% of the movie industry????Netflix collection of BlueRay is at least twice as large as HD and my new 1080P TV is not fully leveraged as this device CAN'T DISPLAY 1080P.Now between the cost of the XBox 360, the Wirless option and the HDTV, I got an expensive messy setup, that is less powerfull and MORE EXPENSIVE than the slick PS3, aside from the fact that a couple of my X-Box games never worked in the first place.I already put my X-Box on sale, and ordered a PS3 !! I also checked the new generation of PS3 games i.e. MotorStorm ..etc. THEY ROCK... I will miss my Halo though :("
1,HD-DVD Problems with Video Games,"This is a player and only a player. Microsoft has no intentions of ever making a game that supports HD DVD. Isn't that the reason we bought an Xbox 360 is to play games? Microsoft TOTALLY missed the mark with this unit. Also it can NEVER achieve 1080P, read the box."
3,"Works only with some HDDVDs, no HDMI output, limited audio (no lossless capable)","I have it for a few months already, works ok, but many discs from universal and other companies do not play well, I guess is because this is a new format and still needs many fixing. At least is relatively cheap, because it seems to be the format that is going to lose the war. I decided to only rent HDDVDs so I will not waste money, and still get the Universal movies that I like.If you think logically, other companies support Blu-ray, just Universal support only HDDVD and hardware has limited functionability, and also is not able to support lossless HD audio, because Xbox 360 only has optical output (lack on HDMI or analog multichannel audio).Overall, you are paying cheap for what you get, a limited HDDVD player."
5,HD DVD is awesome,"I'm really impressed with HD DVD and this is the cheapest way to go about getting the ability to play HD DVD disks. Considering the stand alone players are like 500 dollars, 199 is much cheaper, and I already had an Xbox 360. Movies look amazing on my TV and the extra features on HD DVD are very cool."
5,Worked like a charm,"Hooked it up and it worked like a charm. Video was great. I do wish it would up-convert via component but I its some mpaa rule orsomething so the real problem is the 360 itself needs an hdmi....Anyway , it does work and its fast and a lot cheaper than a stand alone hd dvd unit.If you deduct the 28.00 for king kong and 30.00 for the remote its like 142.00 for the drive..."
5,Great price for a great product,"This is well worth $179.99 for the HD player, especially with the free movies thrown in. The upconverter enables my standard DVDs to play in 1080p mode on my 52'' LCD. The older DVDs look very good, but the HD DVDs look amazing. If you have a HDTV, this is a must buy."
4,Good HD-DVD Player for the money,"The player works well, just make sure you have a high-def TV. A no brainer cost wise if you enjoy movies and own an Xbox 360. Two negative things I noticed were: 1) It did not appear to upconvert regular DVD movies. I was under the impression that HD-DVD players do this. I could be wrong. 2) I found the remote control to be annoying.. It works fine with the Xbox but it is not really a universal remote. Unable to control the receiver or much of the TV functions. I just use the Xbox control pad."
3,Good but not great,"I purchased the Xbox HD dvd player to compliment my home theater system. I have a projector (SANYO PLV Z5) and a 100 inch screen. I was using the xbox to watch my standard DVD's. The picture was up-converted to 720p using component cables. The picture was amazing, I watched lord of the rings, superman and it was all just beautiful.After buying the HD DVD player, I watched King Kong, 300 in HD.I seriously could not find much difference between the HD and the standard up-converted DVD. THe only thing I could think of is on close up shots of actors faces there is a bit more detail. That's it.So; after buying the HD dvd player, I wasn't blown away. Maybe its because my projector only supports 720p.I'm not bashing the HD dvd by any means, because it was a great deal. $179. With the 7 free HD dvd's I got with it was great, so I'm not complaining."
1,bad timing,only 2 weeks after the purchase the formate war ended and HD DVD is now dead so what is the point. shoot.
1,"We did an ""Office Space"" beat down on this junk.","Having to download constant updates to make your Microsoft Windows product work properly may be acceptable for an internet connected computer, but a HD-DVD player? This is not acceptable. I do not have my Xbox 360 connected to the internet and it should work properly whether I do so or not. It is a pain for me to have to go to internet via my computer and burn a disc for my Xbox 360 HD DVD player everytime there is an update that is required to make the newest HD disc play. I have had to do this 3 times for this product. Add to these woes that it doesn't even have basic functions that we have come to take for granted in a dvd player (such as slow motion, frame by frame steps forward and back,etc). I wouldn't even sell this piece of junk to get part of my money back. I would have to lie in order to get rid of it and I just will not do that. We did an ""Office Space"" beat down on it. It felt so good."
2,READ THIS BEFOR BUY IT,"This HD Driver is good but only at first after that you WILL be Sure this is NOT a next generation product it's just for little fun and Money sucking, I give this Product 2 star because1- need one more elect. plug (So you need two with the Xbox)2- The Sound is really BAD3- Looks Ugly with the Xbox Two Driver on each other!!!4- NO HDMIthe Only good things are the Picture but it's not comparable with the Toshiba HD or the PS3 (Blu-ray), and the price is fair (including the Remote and the King Kong HD Movie)"
1,worst purchase ever,"they fail to tell you that you need the newer HDMI xbox 360, if you are still using components like me it doesn't work"
1,not a useful item anymore,"well since the hd-dvd's have died off now this item is useless, maybe it will be worth something 20 years from now?"
5,A must buy for all HD owners,"I have to say this was a very welcome addition and cheap way to add a HD DVD player to your collection. I never thought much of the new format untill I saw it for the first time and saw the difference. Its like seeing the differernce between VHS and DVD. I bought The chronicles of riddick and was really blown away!!!The sey up is also extremeley easy, just plug it in and in the back of the 360. Put in the install disk and thats it!!The load times are compareable to a regular DVD, no long waiting times. And it plays normal DVD'S as well.I've had no problems as of yet with it and hope it will last a few years."
5,Better than I thought,"Just bought this and hooked it up to my Samsung 1080p HDTV and 360. Unbeleivable. The picture blows away anything on the sets you see in the stores when shopping for a TV. Also, I know people who say 'you don't really need an HD-dvd player because regular DVD's look great when upconverted. After having the HD-DVD player, I don't think that anymore. My freinds who said that were surprised to see just how much better the HD-DVD movie looked over even the upconverting DVD-players.My advice, for $200 this is well worth it. If you have an Xbox 360 it is a no-brainer. Even if you don't, it might be worth the upgrade to get this with the 360 for just how good it is, even over component cables. I love it."
4,HD-DVD at a great price and painless setup,"I have too many DVD players to count; including three 400-DVD jukeboxes and two HD-Upconverting players. The 360 HD-DVD player blows them all away - which is what I was expecting.The picture on my 62"" 1080p Mitsubishi looks fantastic even though the HD-DVD player hooks up through the component cables. Of course it does not support 1080p through its HDMI inputs either, so I guess it doesn't matter that the 360 is currently without HDMI output.King Kong is a visually stunning film in the first place, but the HD-DVD version looks amazing (although I did see some graininess during some of the scenes). I just bought the Mission Impossible 3-pack and Serenity, and have plans for Chronicles of Riddick, The Last Samurai, and U-571.If you already have an Xbox 360, this seems like a decent price to enjoy HD-DVD. It may not be the HD player of my dreams, but the picture is much better than my HD-Upconversion players."
1,No use,"This thing is useless. Format war ended, and HD DVDs are near impossible to find. No not buy this. Waste of money."
1,What a piece of junk!!,"I was happy to find an XB360 HDDVD player because my old one broke. But this one that they sent me keeps saying it can't read my HDDVDs. It manages to play eventually and through a whole movie but I expected it to work everytime, especially for the price. Also it didn't even have the King Kong movie that the box said was included. I bet it was not new as they advertised. I'm really disappointed!"
1,good add on- but too obsolete for a real recommendation.,"This was a great idea while the HD wars were going on, and if you still need a player this might be worth considering- but I would really recommend a real standalone player. The cost difference is either negligible or nonexistent now so this isn't really a relevant product. Good while it lasted though!"
1,Does not play all HD DVDs!!!!,"Just rented Matador from Netflix. It will not play.After Googling, I find out that Clerks 2 also has the same problem. Turns out both Clerks 2 and Matador are released by Weinstein Brothers.I called Microsoft Xbox service and they blamed it on the Weinstein Brothers HD DVD's. But yet all other brands of HD DVD players can play these discs, EXCEPT for Microsoft's. Yes, obviously the HD DVD's fault.Thanks MS, for another great software package."
1,Xbox 360 HD DVD=DOA,"Well, I ordered my xbox 360 hd dvd player a few days ago. I got it in yesterday afternoon, set it up, and got ready to be blown away. But I was to be blown away, once again, by microsoft's horrible quality control. When I try to watch an hd dvd my drive just sits there at the dash board and says reading disk. And it gets even better when I try to play a regular dvd. When I try to play a regular dvd I get this loud annoying beeping noise for about 6 seconds. I'm sure it would be a great product if it worked, but it doesn't. This is why I usually don't buy from online stores. Because now they can't replace it because they are out of stock until october. So now I won't be able to enjoy it this weekend or anytime soon, and I needed it for this weekend. At least I can stare at my hd dvd's and pretend I am watching them."
1,Didn't work,"I wish I could give a more thorough review, but it didn't work. It played regular dvd's fine, but would not read HD dvd's at all. Kind of odd for an HD Dvd player."
3,Does what it should,"It is a better DVD player than the 360's OEM drive. It does what it should, not sure how it is still so expensive, but it does what it should."
5,Good hd dvd/dvd player,"I bought this about a week ago. I got it off ebay with a bunch of movies at a really good deal. I purchased this player because i was worried about wear and tear on my 360's drive. It is much quieter than the 360 also, something that was very distracting while watching movies on the 360. Take advantage of this while it's still around. Hd dvds are awesome and dvd's look better with the up-converting. The included remote is very handy too."
5,THEGREATBABOO,"XBOX 360 HD DVD PLAYER WAS VERY EASILY INSTALLED. WHEN PLAYING STANDARD DVD'S, THE CLARITY AND RICHNESS OF COLOR IS REMARKABLE. (AND I'M ONLY USING A 720P HD LCD TV.) I'M VERY HAPPY THAT I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Xbox 360 HD DVD Player,Works well I did not want to invest more for HD until format wars more defined. I got it for 159.00 which was a bargain
2,Short life span,"I've had this for about 8 months and then it died. Microsoft call center wants to charge me $59 just to get it looked at (not including shipping costs). And to top it off, they want to charge me up front. In the 8 months that I've had it, I've used my 360 more for movies than for games so I guess I wore it out pretty good. If you buy this, try and get an extended warranty beyond the 90 days. Otherwise get a dedicated hd-dvd player (which I'll do next) with an extended warranty."
5,Great deal!,"Hey why wouldn't you buy this if you own a 360? I have a PS3 also and have a decent Blu-Ray collection. This purchase was a no brainer for me for $50, and the HD-DVD discs will only get cheaper since Blu Ray has won the ""war"" from what I have read."
5,Love it,This a great dvd player. Even if you want to watch a movie on it that isn't HD it will still make your movie look like it is. Great buy for the money.
2,"Too easy, too boring.","Universal Studios isn't such a great game. It's too easy, and you can onlt visit 5 atrractions. I'm not sure why they gave a a ""T"" rating for! It's easy. Even HARD mode is easy. The graphics are so-so. Backdraft is the only funnest atrrraction. Gotta' go look at Smash Bros now..."
1,don't waste your money,This entire video game is an advertising ploy. It was the biggest waste of money. The game forces you to speak to other characters and all they say is how great universal is and how much fun they are having. The real park is worth the money but don't waste a dime on the vidoe game.
1,Who in the holy heck thought of this game,".... First of all they have these trivia questons that are from the most remote movies ever. Then before you can do ANYTHING you have to pick up other peoples trash (Which is just a dumb idea) Then when you do have the money from picking up trash you try to go on a ride and Woody the Woodpecker say ""This ride is full"" Then you have to go back to the front of the park (I wish you luck doing this)and use the points you got from shaking peoples hands and get a hat. (Another dumb idea) By the way when you try to get back to the ride (again i wish you luck) you cant find it. There is no map or signs of any sort. And the camera angles are horrible. This game is probably the worst game I've ever played in my whole life. ...."
1,"Rent this game, IF YOU WANT TO BE BORED, DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!","This is one of the worst and most boring games I have ever played in my life... It (disappoints) so much, it has boring trivia, which has such horrible questions, it has minigames which use a or b button, and are SO basic and stupid... This is by far the worst GameCube game EVER I hope... I bought it, and then returned it 1 day later because it was so bad... PLEASE LISTEN TO MY ADVICE!!!"
1,What a horrible game!,All I can say is thank goodness we rented this from blockbuster and didn't buy it. This definatly has our vote as the worst game we have ever played.What a drag!
1,"Yes, its as bad as the reviews say!","This game is CRAP!!! Literally. I cant believe this game was ever made! The person who made this piece of junk should play it as punishment! I can't believe Nintendo actually released this! Its like someone picked up a pile of dog crap and threw it at the wall and called it a game.I love movies, love Universal Studios, but this game SUCKS!-200 stars."
1,The cover is the best thing about the game!,"The cover of this game makes it look like an exciting adventure park;however, there is nothing exciting about it. The action is extremely slow. One of the ""exciting"" things they have planned for you is picking up trash. You have to run all over the same places over and over again and find that you can't get into the parks for a good portion of the game. Once in, there are only 5 areas you gain access to and the ""ride"" is extremely dull. This was a big waste of money - I don't think it would even be entertaining for a 3 year old much less a teen or adult."
1,Don't even bother,"This game is really bad. You go into the park and walk around picking up trash off the ground. Then you become hopelessly lost in the park because there are no maps or signs or anything. And when you finally find one of the rides, Woody Woodpecker says you can't go in because there are too many people. So you have to find your way back to the entrance (good luck) and buy a cap with the points you have earned shaking characters hands and picking up trash. The camera angles leave much to be desired and can't be adjusted at all. Back to the Future and Wild Wild West games are moderately fun for about 5 minutes. Anyone can beat the game in a day or two."
4,What the heck is this???,"I went to buy a GameCube game, didn't matter which one, ohh fatal mistake. I held this game in my hands along with other, FIFA 2002, and asked my dad ""Dad, which game do you suggest me to buy?"", what a lot of people don't know is that some parents don't know anything about videogames. My dad answered ""Well son, I would suggest Universal Studios because of the Visual Effects"". Of course he referred to the effects of the movies 'cause this crap doesn't have any graphics that are worth the $50 I payed for it. Damn it!! I played for 20 minutes 10 minutes later I was back in the store, in the Returning Line. Sadly I could return this thing and I try to give away but nobody wants it, so I guess this game will remain here to remind me of my stupidity back in the teenager days. My advice is DON'T BUY THE GAME, DON'T EVEN RENT IT because it will turn into your nightmare, and if you want yo get rid of it no one will want it even if you offer them some cash."
2,don't buy this game rent it only,this is the case of bad planning bad graphics and totally ripping off the gamers.
1,WORST GC GAME EVER!!!,"THIS GAME IS SO FREAKIN BORING!!!all you do is walk around universal studios!!!the graphics are awwwwsooommmebut the gameplay sucks!!Dont get this game,,its not even worth the rent!WORST GC GAME EVER"
1,It really [stinks},Do not get this game! First of all you don't get to go on the good rides. Someone who thought of this game is really dumb. I really would give it a 0 but you can't put 0. It takes to long to go on the ride. All you do mostly is pit up trash. Don't be fooled by this game cover. I'm worring you DON'T GET THIS GAME.
1,The game [is bad]!,"Ya, it looks like a cool game, but it isn't. You think you can explore Universal Studios but you can't. The camra angle [is bad] only two rides are good which are the wild wild west game and the movie quiz the other ones aren't worth the trouble to get to. I bought this game for [an amount of money] and the next week I sold it. And for you parents it shouldn't be rated T, it should be rated EC for early childhood. I hope I help some of you gamers."
2,Fun for a few minutes.,"This game could have a been a world better. The premise is that you are in a theme park, and you must complete ""rides"" which are basically mini games that take a few attempts to master, and once you're done--that's it.While it is cool to see different characters, (Woody Woodpecker, Frankenstien) the map is difficult to move around in. There is no real replay value once you've finished the game. It will just set on the shelf.It's a definate bargain basket game if the price is low enough because of the great graphics and the fact that the mini games are somewhat fun. But, it is fatally flawed with a lack of orginality and low replay value."
3,Too short....,"This was a game I was really looking forward too. It's easy enough for anyone. The only hard parts are the minigames E.T. (bad control), Backdraft (bad control), Jurassic Park (okay control, really hard), Back to the Future (you've got to be perfect in any mode besides easy), and Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show (you have to be perfect). The game is fun to a certain point. The day I got it, I played it for 4 hours straight. But then it's over and there's nothing to do. A solid rental. Just don't go spending ... on it like I did and expect a great game."
1,The horror,"I remember I got this on my birthday. I looked down on gift, self-conscious of my disappointment. So of course I had to play it. In this game, you control a deformed child in Universal Studios. Mysteriously, the park only contains white tourists, which leads me to believe there's a secret underground klan faction somewhere in Universal Studios. (There's some strange fruit growing near the Jaws lake...) Hours of picking up trash and tedious mapping ensue, and you're occasionally treated to a rejected Chuck E. Cheese minigame, only with less smeared pizza and more crappy video game. Sometimes you'll encounter Woody Woodpecker, who apparently vacantly walks around in several park locations at once. He innocently chirps, ""I'll peck out your SOUL,"" as he backhands you for your precious tickets, no doubt to buy illegitimate substances to sell to Cracky Cracksniffer.[...]"
1,IIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTT SSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTIIIIINNNNKKKKKSS,do not buy it. it was a horrible.it will put you into convulsions.it will give you cancer its too late for me.save yourself.
1,the worst game ever created in the face of games ever made!,"This is the worst game that has ever been created. I rented it at 10:30 AM on a saturday, i got home, began to play and at 10:45AM i returned it. It is the biggest piece of crap ever made. The creater should get fired for making me waste 5 dollars on renting it. I was about to buy it too. Thank god i decided to rent it. Please, if you read this, do not even think about buying this game. Too bad i couldn't give it a zero for stars. If you are a parent going to buy this, don't kill you child with boardum."
2,Stupid game for kids from the ages of 10and up,this game was one of the worst games i have ever bought. you go around riding rides and the tasks in the game isnt even hard.
1,This is the ABSOLUTE WORST I have seen!!!,"This is the poorest design I have seen in 20 years of gaming. The interface is extremely confusing. You are moving in one direction until the cut scene then you are moving in the opposite direction. So until you get the hang of it, you're running back and forth between scenes. Most of the attractions will not allow you in until you accumulate enough points for either a cap or an E pass. How do you accumulate points? By picking up garbage and throwing it in trash cans! Wow this is fun! Or collecting letters that make up the name Universal Studios Theme Park. My daughter and I played for about half and hour and finally gave up. It was dull, boring, and frustrating. We had more fun making fun of the game than playing it. I can't believe they actually make you pay for this!!! STAY AWAY unless you want a lesson in how BAD a game can be."
4,Great but..,"This game was great, but Jaws is nearly impossible. fun, but collecting the trash for money just doesnt cut it! (you need money for hats) Great job to the Game Cube for the great graphics."
4,Fun Once You Figure It Out,"I noticed that in most of the reviews most of the people didn't understand the game and thats why they didn't like it. I have to say that the game is confusing in the beginning but once you get the hang of it, it is really fun.In the other reviews the people said things like ""you can only play the games if the lines are not to busy"" but that isn't true the game justs says that if you dont have a pass to get on."
4,A rather enjoyable live album,"""Grand Slam"" Lynott's post Lizzy band was really an accomplished, and talented band, as evidenced by this excellent CD. Recorded over a series of dates in Ireland, the songs are, in most cases, excellent. ""Crime Rate"" ""Nineteen"" ""Night in the life of a Blues Singer"" ""Young Boy"" and others are really given the treatment by a VERY talented band, including Mark Stanway on keyboards, Doish Nagle and Lawrence Archer on guitar, and Robbie Brennan on drums. A very enjoyable disc, that any Lynott/Lizzy fan will really enjoy. Sound quality is not always the best, but the songs stand on their own."
1,Dont buy this. The quality of the vcd is rubbish,"I eagerly awaited the release of this cd and limited edition vcd of the late great Phil Lynott and Grand slam, I had seen the band on this tour,live in ireland myself.But i have to say that the limited edition vcd is the worst quality i'v ever seen.To even give it away free would be too much to pay for this rubbish. It was shot quite a distance from the stage and the band are hazy, even Phil is hard to make out. The sound quality is ok but to be honest if you end up buying this,you'd enjoy it a lot more if you left your tv set switched off. Just listen to the audio track and use your imagination."
1,It looks like BB King Live in Africa!!! Is it the same????,"I have not viewed this DVD but it looks just like the BB King Live in Africa DVD that I do own.Both even mention ""If you look close you can see Ali in the crowd"".The reason I gave it 1 star is because it looks like this is just re-issued with another name. If that is true it's [not woth it]. If it's not true just let me know what's different."
3,Great material for a young reader,"My daughter picked this book out at the school book drive, based largely on the cover art, I think (hey, she's only 6!). She's really not quite ready to read books at this level, but I read it to her before bed over several nights. This was my first encounter with Animal Ark, and though this book occurs pretty late in the series, it stands well enough on its own. As an adult, I found the plot was a little predictable and the characters a little flat, but my daughter was absolutely captivated by the story. The book includes enough educational content that I even learned a thing or two, and I'm sure my daughter learned quite a bit about polar bears and their interactions with human settlements in Canada. This is a pleasant book to read to a youngster and would probably captivate any young reader whose ready to tackle a fairly easy chapter book."
1,Only for completists! there is much better available!,"don't waste your time with this sham...check out the amazing Vestapol video ""in Concert 1971"" instead..the repetoire is first rate as is his group and HIS performance. hopefully it will come out on DVD.."
3,Not at his best,"Muddy Waters has earned his status as a blues legend. BUT, this concert was poorly performed. At times, it looked as though the band didn't even want to be there, and they periodically became out of sinc and out of tune. Muddy did not put his all into his music, which was dissappointing because the whole point of the blues is to FEEL the music. Winter's appearance spiced it up a bit. It is worth having if you are a Muddy fan, Winters fan, or blues collector. For that reason alone, I give it a three. And, as the previous reviewer stated, it's a good thing his Chicago Blues Festival performance was recored at all.SONGS INCLUDE: Mannish Boy/ Oh Baby You Don't Have To Go/ Baby Please Don't Go/ I'm A King Bee/ Trouble No More/ They Call Me Muddy Waters/ Walking Thru the Park/ Going Down Slow/ She's Nineteen Years Old (in black and white)/ Love Her With Feeling/ Have You Ever Been Mistreated/ Mojo Working"
3,Not the best Muddy performance....but worth renting,"I rented this DVD recently and did a little reasearch afterward. The date of it is 8/4/81, which I believe puts it among Muddy's final performances. That could explain the mediocre performance. The sound quality is not great and the video quality is poor. It's badly edited in spots, but worth watching just the same if you like Muddy."
1,Historical interest only,This is of historical interest only. The video quality is extremely poor (actually goes to black and white for a song or two) and the sound quality is equally poor. Pass on this unless you have to have the historical documentation
1,False title,"How can this be from the Chicago Blues Festival? The Chicago Blues Festival, the official City of Chicago-sponsored one that's held in Grant Park every year, began in 1984. Muddy Waters died in 1983. Muddy's an immortal, to be sure, but . . . ?"
3,"OK, but there are better books for this age","This book evokes a familiar scene to any parent - a tired mother trying to get a not-so-tired baby to sleep. It is fine for a few readings, but it doesn't offer anything particular special to keep you or your child coming back.The artwork is fair, but I wasn't too taken with the book's incomplete baby-talk sentences (""Look at baby. Smart, good baby. Happy baby. Making gravy. Applesauce and ketchup gravy."")"
1,Don&#65533;t buy this camera,"I have had this camera for little more then a year now, and suddenly the camera at times freezes up when you try to turn it off. I tried emailing and calling Kodak for help. After many attempts I was told it will cost $250 to exchange the camera and to forget about servicing it. I did not spend the money on a camera that I can't trust to work after only one year. I will be buying another camera-most likely a Sony I will definitely never buy a Kodak camera again."
