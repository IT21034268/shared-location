5,carbon copy replacement hubcaps,"What can be said? They do exactly what they're supposed to do.I have a Dodge Grand Caravan 96 (3.3L model), and it fit perfectly. The (fake) washers are even shiny!"
4,Wheel Covers,"The wheel covers are what they were described to be. They are a good value for the price, and look good on the car. These are excellent replacement covers at a bargain price."
3,wheel covers for Dodge Caravan,They look just like the original except that they are plastic. They are very good if you are a careful person and don't scratch them.
2,UNFAIR!!,"there should be a law against this,it is the very same cd as THANK YOU,GOODNIGHT..A GREAT SHOW but unfair to bring it out under a different name 2 years later"
3,so near yet so far...,"Nothing wrong with the music, it's Great White in their natural environment.. BUTThat 2 second gap.... I was hoping that the passing of time would have enabled Sidewinder to correct a fundamental flaw , but no, still there!so what to do.I suggest that all the people that bought this email them and ask why?Let's see what direct action does!And do the band realise that hey are being represented in this manner?"
3,"Great White Once Bitten, Twice Live",It is an excellent cd if you can get how the songs are broken between songs which is very annoying
5,One Christian Band that really rocks.,Fear Not takes the heavy sound of the 80's and combines it with the punch of the ninety's. I would recomend this CD to anyone who had a love of hard rock.
4,Impressive melodic rock release,"This 1993 self-titled album was the only release from Christian melodic rockers Fear Not. The band, who was lucky enough to score a production job by the Elefante brothers, had a melodic rock sound that was somewhere between Mr. Big and early Skid Row, sort of like a harder rocking Guardian.The album is chock full of catchy guitar hooks, great melodies, strong vocals, and songs you want to sing along to. The band is definitely pushing a Christian message, but it's not so blatant as to preclude non-Christian listeners from enjoying the music.I suppose it's not all that surprising that the band never issued more than a single album. As good as they were, the musical climate in the mid 90's wasn't exactly friendly to long haired melodic rockers, Christian or otherwise. At least the band left behind an album that definitely should be a part of any Christian rock fan's collection, and one that mainstream melodic rock fans should find quite enjoyable as well."
3,Not for experienced programmers!!,"At first glance this book looks great like you are ""jumping in with both feet"" to VB.NET. However, if you have any background whatsoever in programming the lack of detailed information about key topics can be very irritating. If you are someone who has very little experience and wants to make a simple windows app in VB.NET this might be what you are looking for...if you are a professional coder looking to learn VB.NET don't waste your time with this book! Great for first timers new to visual studio 2003....not so great for everyone else"
3,Not Comprehensive,"The title could rather be given as sams teach yourself VB.NET ""for"" 8 hours....All what has been presented here can be mastered in just 8 hours. This book lacks essence in conveying the concepts. It does not also cover all parts of VB.NET. The author could have dedicated some more topics on ADO.NET and database programming.This book sounds good to novices in VB.NET but a money waste for experienced programmers."
1,Could do better by buying another book,"The problem with this books is ironically due to the success of his others. This book is a warmed-over version, and does not address the sticky issues of .NET"
4,Well done James Foxall,"Fellow readers,I have no hesitation in recommending Jame Foxall's book ""Visual Basic.Net 2003. He has put a lot of effort into taking you through step by step and reinforcing each lesson learnt. The back-up images and files have also had a lot of work put into them.The .Net Visual Studio is a quantum leap forward and this is a great book to get started.RegardsAlun."
4,first ever review,"I think James Foxall's book on VB.Net successfully hits the middle ground, not an easy task, particularily within the constraints of a '24hr' structure.The style is clear and logical and the pace was just right for me.I found his constant reminders of good practice very reassuring.The examples were more than adequate.I must confess I have 'dipped into' many books on VB.Net, therefore by definition I am not a novice and this may have helped in my understanding of the book.Most readers will get added value and early rewards from this work."
4,Excellent for beginning VB .NET,"Great introduction to VB .NET and the Visual Studio IDE. I am a novice MS Access developer migrating to Visual Studio .NET. This books is an excellent quick start for devloping with VB .NET. But don't expect to get in depth. It's just a primer, but well worth it if that's what you need. You will need to continue learning with other books. Also, the DVD-ROM 60 day trial version of Visual Studio is great. I'm going to buy the full version when done."
4,The Best Sixties...True to its title??,"If you're looking for an album that's true to its name..then buy ""The Best Sixties Album in the World...Ever"". This album has a wonderful mix of songs. It has everything from classics like ""Pretty Woman"" by Roy Orbison, ""Mustang Sally"", ""My Girl"" sung by the Temptations, and ""Daydream Believer"" by the Monkees to fun songs such as: ""Wild Thing"" peformed by The Trogs and ""Born to be Wild"". I usually don't listen to much 60s music, but this album is a well-listened one in my expansive selection of cds. If you want a cd that can remind you of the good old days then this is the one to buy! They even have some favorites like : ""Bend Me, Shape Me"", ""You've Lost that Loving Feeling"" by the Righetous Brothers..and hear Aretha Franklin belt out her signature song, ""Respect"". So get this cd today and turn up your stereo!"
4,Some Plus And Some Minus Points!,"Lets get the minus points out of the way first.There's no Beatles, Rolling Stones, Dylan or Hendrix.Also it's not in chronological order, to see how music has progressed.On the plus side, there are loads of fantastic tracks.On CD 1 the very best are:Gary Puckett And The Union Gap: Young Girl.The Searchers: Sweets For My Sweet.The Everly Brothers: Cathy's Clown.On CD 2 look out for outstanding recordings:The Beach Boys: I Get Around.Bobby Fuller Four: I Fought The Law.Booker T And The MG's: Green Onions.P.P Arnold: The First Cut Is The Deepest.Fleetwood Mac: Albatross.So there it is, 50 tracks with over 2 hours of 1960s music to either take you back fifty years or discover for the first time."
1,"Should have been called, 'The Pacifist Quotation Book'","First, I want to make it clear that there are quite a few excellent quotes on the military, war, courage, leadership, and so on. Exactly what you are buying the book for.However, I would estimate that more than half the quotes are snarky sarcasm and anti-war, anti-military in nature, sneering that the military tradition and necessity.Perhaps this is the author's notion of ""fair and balanced"". Technically, the quotes are all about the military and war.Perhaps others will find the words of, say, Ursula LeGuin, to be worthwhile and insightful on the nature of these things. I do not. I find it to be a waste of my time."
1,BRITISH HILLBILLIES,"""Small Town Folk"" has a cutesy title and a cool Dvd cover and then it goes downhill and never climbs back up. Mostly scenes of British rednecks who kill anyone who venture into their small town of Grockleton. Most of the maniacs have grossly bad teeth, but i just chalked that up to British dentistry. The movie is pretty much unwatchable despite the gore and I checked out of Grockleton about half way through. And I couldn't even bear to watch the ""Leprachaun"" himself, Warwick Davis being carried around on the back of a giant retard.You have been warned-this is a movie for people who like bad teeth, bad breath and bad taste. And oh, those British hillbillies are so proper, one even wears a derby."
1,absolute crap,this film is literally like watching a very bad high school play recorded by someones parents on the family camcorder. save your money and don't buy this complete cinematic flop.
4,home alone with Attean,"I liked Sign Of The Beaver becouse all the hunting and the stuff that Attean taught them. And whenever Matt taught Attean how to read, that was cool - the way he did that. It had a happy ending."
3,Not the Best Book I've Read But Certainly Not the Worst,"For a book report I read Sign of the Beaver.It was an okay book.The main reason I didn't like it very much is because it didn't go into much detail.When Matt tried to get honey from a bee hive, it didn't say much about the hive itself. Otherwise it was a great book."
3,Fifth Grade Student (mjd),"The Sign of the Beaver is a great book if you like adventure and if you don't mind sad parts. I personally thought the book was just good. I didn't like the sad parts about when the animals get hurt because I love animals. I liked the parts when Matt and Attean were teaching each other because it was fun to see how they would react.I like how the author would always have something for us to think about. Overall, I thought the book was okay."
3,Satisfactory,I wouldn't really recommend this book to a friend of mine even though it was a pretty realistic story. The setting was hard to get because of all the sudden changes in background. I must say that it was a pretty good story.-Kyle Wahl
2,sucky in spanish,"I read this book in spanish class (i am fluent, so I understood everything) and this book bored me to death. I was not able to pay any attention while reading this book. It lacked a lot of good action."
2,Boring plot.,"I have to agree with CaseyNissa from California. I also have to say that the Native American part wasn't very realistic. Not many of them would have even wanted to talk to White men, much less make friends with them. HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great book,I think this is a great book. But I think that it should have one more page. I recommend this book to everyone!
5,Sign of the Beaver,I thought this was a great book. It might be better to read it aloud to children and explain some of the differences and likeneses of today and the past.
3,"Great relationships, but slow read","The Sign of the Beaver by Elizabeth George Speare tells the tale of a young boy, Matt, who, when left on his own, befriends an Indian named Attean. The story tells of their adventures in the Maine wild while they learn and help each other. The friendship between Attean and Matt earned this book our three star rating; we enjoyed the formation of their friendship.-------One student: As an 11 year old reader and a girl, I couldn't connect strongly to the book. I also had trouble reading through their use of animals for survival as I found it ""gross and upsetting"".Student: I also found it a slow read as it took some time to get to the excitement.Student: It would be a stronger book if Matt's family were able to meet Attean and the other Indians as they were such as important part of Matt's summer alone.-------If you like themes of survival, hunting, and friendship this book would be a good read for you. If not, look around for another book!"
4,Living on the Edge,"Overall I liked the book. The reason I liked the book was it had a happy ending. I also liked the book because the author has a talent for painting very descriptive pictures in my head. The only reason I didn't like the book was there were too many bad events that occured after Matt, the main character's, dad left . As I've already mentioned, I liked the book and I wouldn't change anything. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be on the edge of their seat at the end of each chapter."
4,The Sign Of The Beaver,"The Sign Of The Beaver by Elizabith George Speare is about a 12 year old boy named Matt who has to survive on his own because his father went away to get Matt's mother and sister. Matt learns to survive by himself with the help of an Indian friend. I like this book because Matt has alot of adventures with his Indian friend, Attean."
4,Every chapter is full of action and it is funny.,"The Sign of the Beaver is an awesome book! It is about a boy and an Indian. The boy's dad had to go away with his mother and sister to the town so they could have their new baby. The boy's job is to take care of the cabin in the wilderness and grow their crops and keep them fresh. He learns to make a bow and arrows so he can shoot his dinner. In the middle of the story they fight a bear. The best part of the book was when Attean and Matt went to Attean's village. They played a game where they have bones with one side red and the other sides not red. You throw up the bones, and if they fall on the ground all red side up, then you win. Matt lost and had to give away his only shirt. Later the Indians gave it back to him. A fourth through sixth grader book."
4,KidView2,"I thought that The Sign of the Beaver by Elizabeth George Spear was an excellent book. It was about a boy named Matt who is watching the cabin while his mother, father, and his sister were gone. Matt met two indians named Attean and Saknis. It was a rough start. Matt teaches Attean and Attean teaches Matt. They were like brothers. Matt has to make a lot of tough decisions. I think this book is exceptional for everyone who likes nature, action, adventure, and drama books."
4,A Realistic Picture of Pioneer Days Without Being Mawkish or PC,"Speare gives a realistic picture of the edgy but generally humane interactions between the Native Americans and the European settlers. SOTB is unstintingly honest but not depressingly so, and is interesting in its description of life in those days. And it gives many interesting details about life as lived in earlier and simpler times. I enjoyed reading it to my kids and they seemed to enjoy it too. Recommended."
5,If you like hunting you will like this book.,I recommend this book to someone who likes hunting and fishing. It is about a boy whose name is Matt who meets up with an Indian boy whose name is Attean. Attean wants Matt to join his tribe does he ? Read it and find out.
4,Sign of the Beaver,This book is about a boy named Matt who is from Massachusetts. Matt and his dad had made a log cabin in Maine. Then his to go to Massachusetts and get the family. Will Matt's dad come back? If you want to find out go to your school library.
5,a very good story that conveys important historical insights,"Engaging story of a youngster who assumes a man's responsibilities on the New England frontier in colonial days. Befriended by indians, the protaganist comes to understand how the arrival of the white settlers spells the end of the indians' way of life."
5,great life lessons,"It is a great book,it's so hard to put down!! there are a lot of life lessons in it that are great for kids ages 9-13.the movie The Homecoming is the story with a different name. But I like the book better!!"
4,The sign of the beaver,I enjoy the book and I've read it about 4 timesbut what happens to the Indians at the huntdoes Attean ever come back?I give it a four star rating only because it is very short
5,A wonderful classic!,"This book was a great suprise for me. A young native boy teaches another ""white"" boy (living on his own) how to hunt without bullets or rifles, fish without a man made hook, make a bow and arrow, and so much more. A wonderful friendship grows between the boys in a time when friendship of this nature was frowned upon. A wonderful story. This book will be even more exciting for the child who loves the outdoors. We adults will learn quite a thing or two as well."
4,Sign of the Beaver,"Hey I just read this cool book for all you historical fiction lovers. It's called Sign Of The Beaver by Elizabeth George Speare.In the book there were three things I really liked. I liked how it was crazy and adventurous and how the boy Matt started to make a union between white men and Indians. Also I liked it when Matt finds out that all his beliefs about Indians were wrong. One thing I hated was the ending; Matt's dad doesn't come back.In the beginning Matt's father goes to get supplies and pick-up the rest of the family. When his father doesn't return Matt gets worried and finds Indian tribe. They are the Beaver Tribe. Well I won't spoil the fun but towards the end Matt creates a special bond with the Indians.This book takes place in the wilderness of Maine, in 1769. There are many trees; it's very green there, filled with shrubs and plants."
4,A fifth grade reading book,"Sign of the Beaver is about a boy named Matt that lives in the woods with his father. One day his father leaves while he is sleeping. He knows where he went. A month later he met some Indians and started to read a book to a Indian. The book was about the dad leaving and an Indian helping out. I think this is a great book! Matt thinks that the Indan (Attean) is very inpolite. But the more Matt and Attean are around each other they get used to one another and become good friends, and Attean teaches Matt to hunt. He never finds his father, but he finds a good friend and he is no longer afraid or alone.At the end his father comes back with his family and they lived a new life.I hope you love this book!!!"
2,5th grade student (beaver),I didn't really like the book. But that is just my opion. It didn't have anough action for me. I like to read adventure books. It seems like they were just sitting around.
2,Sign of the Beaver-CD,"The voice reading Sign of the Beaver was pleasant and easy to listen to. Since I was not listening to the whole book in one sitting, it was difficult to find where on the CD I left off. It would be more efficient to have the track for each chapter labeled on the CD."
5,Sign of the Beaver,This book was very emotional and interesting. I think that Sign of the Beaver is a G R E A T school book!
5,What A Great Book!![.],"""Sign of the Beaver"" This book is the absolute greatest book in the world!! I read this book and had to have it. This story begins when Matt's dad leaves to get his family. Matt is a 13 year old boy who has to take care of the cabin while his fater goes to get his family. While Matt is alone he discover the Indians and learns to survive in the wild. I like then part when he made a bow and some arrows. Now I'm trying to make one. I will not give away the ending so buy the book and find out how it goes!"
1,sucks,I did not like it because it was all ruined pages were torn and people had written all over the back cover so I relized that it was quite hard to read so I will most likely never by a book from amazon againP.s the book was NEW for crying out loud
5,A second grader says this is the best book in the world,"Matt's parents left him to get his mother's sister and baby. While they were gone, Matt had a guest named Ben. Ben stole Matt's father's rifle. The next day Matt followed a bee to its hive. When Matt tried to get the honey, he got stung and fell into a river. Two Indians, Antean and his grandfather, took Matt back to his house.Through the story Matt taught Antean to read and Antean got Matt food and taught him to make Indian things. One day Matt and Antean were walking through the woods andd they saw a mother bear with her cub. Antean shot the bear with an arrow. That night Matt, Antean, and his tribe ate the bear. The next day, Matt and a girl freed Antean's dog from a bear trap. Matt and Antean were friends.I liked this book because it is cool how a 10-year-old boy can take care of himself for about a year."
5,The best exiting book ever!!!,It was the good because Matt met new friends which was Attean and the village. He kinda did his responsibility but he didn't take care of the cabin so he lost a few stuff. I also think that little kids sould read this book because it is exiting. So for all you readers you sould read this book.
4,A great book!,"Matt, a 13-year-old boy who lives in colonial times goes with his father from their home in Qunicy into the wilderness of Maine to claim land and build a cabin. His father then leaves him there, and returns to Quincy to fetch his wife and daughter. While Matt is alone, he has numerous adventures, which include meeting an Indian boy, and having an unfortunate encounter with a bear. A vivid book; it will make you feel like you are there. You will feel like you can make the choices Matt must make. When Matt did something, I could see it in my mind. When he made important choices, it made me think about what I would do. It will really make you feel like you are there!"
4,This novel is a good springboard to Native American studies,"This is the third year that I have used The Sign of the Beaver with my fifth graders. I find it to be a gentle springboard to a more in-depth study of Native American issues. Though the Native American characters are drawn rather sketchily, my students are awakened to the deeper issues surrounding their confrontation with white settlers through the eyes of young Matthew Hallowell, the main character."
4,A Review of Sign of the Beaver,"SIGN OF THE BEAVER REVIEWElizabeth George Speare writes in a fashion that always gives you something new to be excited about and lets you exist in her writing. This heart stopping book will delight those who love a creative mix of drama, adventure, friendship, and well-paced wording. I'm sure those people will agree with me that describing this as a good book is an understatement. It tells of a settler boy and an Indian boy who meet and have many adventures in the woods of Maine. The characters are wonderful because their personalities are almost everyone in the world. I do not know a single person that cannot relate to these characters. In general, it's a two thumbs up read."
5,OMG,BEST BOOK IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D. ;D Yay yay yay AWESOME BOOK I love it :D. <(~<)
4,The sign of the beaver,This was a good book and it had a lot of lessons. This book could teach you about how to survive in the woods. What I learned from this book is that Matt teaches Attean and Attean teaches Matt. What happens in this book is that Matt made a deal with Atteans grandfather. If Matt taught Attean how to read Atteans grandfather would give him a treaty.
2,The Sign of the Beaver,The book was not that great. It was not well written. If you do not have to DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. The movie was terrible. horrible book
2,An awful book!,"I was extremely disapointed with this book by the beloved author Speare. The beginning is extremely good and hooks you, reading for more. But after that hook you get a dull part. A very dull part! Nothing seems to happen, and it turns into the average boring must survive in the woods tale. And the ending wasn't anything big so I was glad to get it out of my hands."
2,Kind of boring,My teacher read to us and I thought it was kind of boring. It didn't have any action it didn't make any sense. I do not recomend it. I gave it 2 stars.
1,5th grade student (S.H),"I liked the Sign of the Beaver. I really liked how the author wrote the book. but somtimes when there was supposed to be really exciting parts the author didn't explain it well. Even though there wasn't any pictures, I could still visualize it in my mind. I really liked how the author explained the characters in the book. I would definitely recommend this book."
1,Fith Grader Review,"I very very very very much disliked this book. I think the book went to fast. The author could have made us wait longer 'till the end. You know to build up the suspence. If you would like to read this book go for it, but I didn't tell you to!"
2,"Boring, boring, boring!","The Sign of the Beaver by Elizabeth Speare was one of the dumbest and most boring books that I have ever read in my whole life. It's about a boy who befriends and accompanies a native boy named Attean and his tribe on many adventures. The boy, Attean, becomes his daytime companion and together they learn about each other's culture. When Matt's father still doesn't return from picking up his family to bring them to their new home, Matt starts to worry. But when Attean's tribe ask him to accompany them on their hunt, Matt is forced to make one of the most important decisions of his lifetime. Should he stay and wait for his father, even though he might not come, or should he go with the tribe? This book does give really good information. It is also sort of a suspense book and hard to guess what is going to happen next in certain parts. Stay away from this book if you can, but if you have to read it, just get it over with fast."
4,MS. England's Class Book Review,"Our class learned from this book about Indians and what they are able to grow. We also learned about new languages, new types of food, and how to make new things. The book taught us about what Indianas use in their own lives. We learned that the Indians used every part of an animal for clothes, tools, food, and weapons. The story taught us about different types of sign language and picture writing that is used by the Indians. This book should be read by other kids because it is a book that is interesting and one you can learned a lot of things from."
5,A great childhood book about history,"This lovely book is a great book to show children tolerance between cultures. It is a study of how one boy sees the Native Americans in a positive light. Matt is able to experience friendship, loyalty, and acceptance. I was touched at how the grandfather showed love towards Matt. Also, Attean's final gift to Matt shows how much he thought of Matt-generosity and sacrifice. It is interesting for its historical perspective too, as the work of the Native American woman was shown in this book!! A highly recommended read."
3,5th grade,I think this book is ok. I would recommend it to others I liked all the details they gave. I thought there should be more action and adventure I liked the characters in the story.overall this book was ok.
1,"""the most intresting book ever""","We are 5 sixth grade girls and we read this book at school. The book that we read was not intresting. In the beginning it was so BORING, but in chapter 13 it got intresting, but then it got boring again until the end becuase the baby that Matts mom was carrying in her belly died and that was sad. Also when the dad left Matt home in the cabin by himself, also this guy name Ben stole his shot gun when the bear distroyed his food he had no gun to kill the bear with. I give this book one star becuase it was not intresting. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Go stare at a brick wall, it is more exiting",I hated this book. This kid has to stay at this cabin till his father comes back with his family. Then he meets this ben guy who takes his rifle so he can only eat fish. then he gets stuck in a tree and the bees come at him. Then he meets this attean dude and matt teaches him how to read. then attean killed a bear and matt helped. matt goes to this indian party and falls asleep eating bear meat. attean take him to a room. then the grandmother is mad cuz a white person slept in her bed. then atteans dog gets caught in a trap. Matt tells the tribe and the grandma helped so she was not mad any more. the indians decide to move away and they want to take matt with him. he does not go and he waits for his parents. they come and he is happy. I would not recomend this book to anyone.
2,what kind of book is this!?,"This book was so boring i couldn't stand to finish it! Never was I excited, or eager to read more. Its famous and supposed to be good but I couldn't stand reading the whole thing. Some books time seems to go by fast while reading, with this its like the book never ends, although it is short it seems really long. I would suggest getting it from a library first to see if you really want to buy the atrocity that is Sign of the Beaver."
4,WIGWAM READ,"Dear Readers,I hope you like this book.You might chose not to but try it.Its about a boy in the wilderness.His name is Matt.He is alone.He teaches an Indian and they become friends.If I were him I would be so happy for new friends,I'd scream.In the story I feel like Matt.If you read this PLEASE try to write a review."
5,Forth Grade Review,"This book is a good book. The chatacters semed so real to me.I had to read this book for my reading class and I judged it by it's cover and the name.But when our reading class got more into the book I started to like it.This book is about a boy who moves to Maine in the wilderness. His dad has to go get the family Matt has to guard it. One day he meets Indans and makes a deal with them. His dad said that he would be back in seven weeks and the indians were going to move. They invite Matt to come with them. There is no sign of Matt's dad and he has to make a choice to stay at his cabin, no knowing if his father will come back, or go with the indians."
4,5th grade Review,"The Sign of the Beaver was a great book. The aouther added many details, but not too many. The charaters had to hard decisions and overcome obstacles. I could visulize almost everything in my head. I also wanted read aheadanother chapter. I also liked the time peroid in the story. The charaters had to make all their supplies from the resources around them. I hope you enjoy the Sign of the Beaver!"
5,VERY GOOD,"Very good, and interesting from beginning to end. No bad parts the whole thing was good!!!!!! I will read It again and again."
5,"This book was great, a must for summer reading.",We loved this book and would recommend it to families to read during an evening reading time. Turn off the TV and enjoy a good book it will expand your mind! No wonder it got an award. You can feel safe in what your child is reading with this book.
4,This is a really good book.,"I thought my book was good for two reasons. One reason is because it showed how two completly different types of people can get along together. When Attean and his grandfather saved Matt, I thought that it showed great friendship between the two types of people. Another thing it showed was what hard lives people had in the past. People couldn't just go out and get clothes and food, they had to kill animals for the food and clothes. I thought that this book would be good for fourth and fifth graders to read because I think it's easy to read and to understand."
5,Outstanding!,"This is a great live recording and Nneena is outstanding, as usual! If you've never had the opportunity to experience her in a live setting - buy this CD and you are there!"
2,Not so innocent,"While I am quite a fan of Vettriano's work, most of the painting I've seen displayed on the Portland Gallery's website were of the type as ""The Singing Butler."" The paintings in ""Lovers and Other Strangers"" are not all so innocent. While they are all wonderful compostions I wasn't expecting the highly sexual nature of the pieces. (Perhaps I should have from the title.) There are several of his in this book of the type I enjoy such as ""After Midnight"" and ""Winter Light and Lavender"" I am not such a fan of Quinn's choices. While it gives a broad view of Vettriano's work you might not enjoy it if your favorite pieces are ""Singing Butler"" and ""Mad Dogs."" I do like the composition of all the pieces as well as the use of color I was not always taken with the choice of models. If you, like myself, enjoy Vettriano's work that are character studies of average people you might not care for the sexually charged nature of most of the pieces in this book."
5,Best of the Post-Bradley works,"I've read probaby all of the late Marion Zimmer Bradley's works (excepting the numerous short story compilations). I think I prefer MZB's writing in the books that came out chronologically in the middle of her series (not the early pulp fiction books), like Bloody Sun, Thendara House, Forbidden Tower, and the Sharra series. They were compelling stories of culture clashes, struggles with sexuality, gender roles, and technology. The later books seem to stray from the themes that are really what makes Darkover stand out. That said, this was my favorite of the collaborative books between MZB and another author. A fundamental part of Darkover culture is the ""Compact"", an agreement not to use any weapon that doesn't put you in reach of your opponent. This book discusses how the compact was reached. I found Varzil to be a fascinating figure - strong, serious, driven, brilliant. Very unusual for both MZB's work and other science fiction."
4,Good for beginners,"This book is helful for beginner RPG programmers. They should have worked a little more on the index. There are many references not listed in the index that exist in the book. Overall, I recommended it to beginners, for more experienced programmers that wish to learn RPG IV, is OK but you may find yourself skipping what your already know."
4,A great book for entry-level RPG IV programmers.,"The examples and their explanations are outstanding. A great way to learn RPG IV for those familiar with the AS/400. Some text needs proof reading, but the typos are amusing. The index is a little weak, though overall a great book."
5,GRAND SLAM,"Four great seasons of the ultimate gangster saga. The fifth and (final) sixth should firmly cement the legacy of this stalwart series.Season One is the best of the group, as it usually is with most stellar series. The best episodes: #9, #12 and #13. Season Two's finest moments are with the epitome of all evil, Richie Apriel, played with intense sinisterness by David Proval, and the David Lynch-esque finale.Season Three welcomes Ralphie C (Joe Pantaliano) and Season Four ushers him out in grand style (that will prove to be a defining moment in the shows history). Season Four also has some sensitive moments from Tony Soprano himself: His all night vigil with a sick horse (as Dean Martin sings ""My Rifle, My Pony & Me""), his tolerance of Christopher's drug addiction (and the hilarious intervention that follows). Great series, great set. Watch them all."
4,Dover_John,This is another great book in the Dover series of Classics. All of the books in this series are well worth the cost and have been for at least 30 years. Guess that is why they are classics.
2,Book does not meet my expectation,"Having some background in Hamiltonian Mechanics I decided to buy the book to learn something about aberrations in optics. Till chapter 4 I found the book interesting. It defines the optical lenght and explain Fermat Principle, define caracteristic funcions and deduce vectorial ray equations. Chapter 3 explains how important properties can be deduced from symmetry. Chapter 4 introduces different types of aberrations considering the displacement from the ideal imaged point. In paragraph 23. defines the effective aberration coefficients and from there on the book loose all his clarity. It changes several times the notation and writeslong expresion of 12 or more terms with so many coeffiecients that is not posible to remember what are their meaning. I skiped paragraphs, pages and chapters but get the same stuff. So I enjoy only 1/5 of the book (which is better than nothing...) and get disppointed from the rest."
3,GHost of a story,This was a free book on Amazon. The story was fairly thin and the main character not all that appealing.
5,Wonderful book,This is the third book of Darrell Johnson I have read. He is an insightful and a profound theological thinking. His insight on the Triune God (community of God) has been inspiring to my soul. Pastor Johnson's writings are refreshing and illuminating. The current book is no exception. Worth the purchase. In fact I have purchased an additional five copies to give to friends and family.
3,a good cover...,"as far as a work in the genre of biographies, this book doesn't stand out. but since it is a biography of heidegger, it stands out nevertheless. safranski depicts heidegger narrow and straight without any recourse to psychologism or moral condemnation/justification. this is an intellectual biography and a fairly successful one at that. safranski does a good job of describing heidegger's education and he gives a good, general account of most aspects of heidegger's philosophy.the chapter on heidegger and arendt is particularly illuminating--just because the subject is so juicy to begin with. and again: safranski does not put heidegger on trial. it's a good thing. similarly, he depicts the question of nazism that looms over heidegger with a balanced account. intresting note: i didn't know that heidegger was conscripted briefly by the german civilian army towards the end of the second world war, did you?"
1,Picture Misleading!s ONLY 2 PADS TOTAL!!,Very good quality pad . . . I seriously thought I was getting what the picture shows. Why would you put a picture of 4 pads and only sell 2? Oh . . .to get suckers like me to buy it! Very misleading! Not happy amazon!
1,"Broke the Tank, Almost Caused Fire","These things melted, cracked the tank in several places, and almost caused a fire. DO NOT USE. I followed the instructions to the letter and am only glad we were home and the house didn't catch on fire."
2,Doesn't really work,"I bought this for my 10 gallon hedgehog's cage.The directions says that it's better to put it on a side, to avoid contact with water that could produce an electroshock.Well, I did that and only the part where it was got warm. The rest of the cage was still cold.I waited for six hours and nothing happened.So I decided to put it under the cage, under my hedgehog's sleeping place.At least it warmed that small zone.It's been like 8 months since I purchased it, and yesterday it stopped working.Wasn't worth my 20 bucks(that's the price at Pet Smart)."
5,Nork enjoys the warmth,"Item works as described for my 10 yr old's leopard gecko, Nork, he loves it. We live in Minnesota so we need to keep our little lizard friend comfortably warm. We have both a light for heat and this pad that is under his 10 gallon glass aquarium. Easy to install with the self adhesive and a self adhesive rubber ""foot"" for each corner. These corners allow the tank to sit off of the surface to allow airflow and keeps it consistently warm for our little friend."
4,Good but the small size does not do much in winter,"I have a 10 gallon hermit crab tank with 5 inch deep moist sand. I put this on the side of the tank last night (as the packet instructs as the best method) and the tank temperature has been about 70 - which is the same as the house. The crabs are sitting next to it, so while it's helping, it's not enough. (The instructions specify that if your animal sits next to the pad you need more heat.) I've ordered a large pad - maybe the small is effective in the summer with air conditioning, but it's not enough in the winter. Otherwise it seems to be doing exactly what it says it will do.(As a side note, I turned on the electric blanket and wrapped that around the tank while waiting for a pad - crabs have loved that. Between the blanket and small pad they are finally out playing again!)"
3,"It was warm, but","I could feel that the glass immediately next to the heater was warm. However, I did not think it made much difference. However, I was not sure if the product was designed like this or I got a defective item. I will return the item and just place my wireless router and broadband modem next to the tank to get more heat."
3,Barely effective,"This is an adhesive heating pad. The instructions definitely warn away from putting it on the bottom of the tank and suggest a sidewall as the preferred mounting point. Unfortunately, when placed on a sidewall, the heater is barely effective at keeping the enclosure warm. In fact, the pet has to be pretty much right up against the glass for there to be any benefit. In hindsight, I would mount the heater to the bottom but I don't think the adhesive would work twice."
2,didn't heat to temperature,"The heater didn't heat up my 10-gallon hermit crab tank to the temperatures needed to obtain ideal conditions. Even after adding another smaller stick-on heater, I still have to provide supplemental heat. Not impressed with the product, but the speed of delivery was fine."
1,It broke within 3 days!,I thought that it would be ok for the lizard that we have. I installed just like the directions said and it broke. Very disappointed:(
1,didn't work,I attached it to my 10 gal hermit crab habitat and it didn't do anything... It sat attached and plugged in all night long and haven't raised temp. a single degree. I returned it
3,Works well... until it doesn't...,"I purchased this for my son's hermit crabs, and he had the system set up in his room where it worked fine. During Christmas break, he was going to spend about 8 days with his grandparents, so I asked that he bring the small cage and heater downstairs so I could care for his critters. Well, the heater never worked again. It has a sticky-ish bottom, and we think maybe the heating element broke as he peeled the heater up from the top of his dresser, but who knows? Regardless, it is now occupying space in a landfill."
2,Didn't work for my needs...,"Maybe I had unrealistic expectations, but this did not help my situation. My son as two hermit crabs in a glass ten gallon tank, I applied this to the side of the tank and it never stuck well and only felt slightly warm to the touch, expected hotter. Did nothing to increase the temp in the tank, but I have no lid so maybe it wouldn't work due to that? I ended up getting the best results by buying a red heat bulb for our clamp light."
2,not a primary sorce of heat,"We have a leopard gecko that should have his warm side of the tank around 85 degrees, this heater is not able to heat it up to that temp. We did install it properly to the bottom of the tank, but we are disappointed in it."
1,Needs better instruction. Or include other items.,"Some people on here said it can only be used on glass. Mine apparently was the opposite. Destroyed the glass on my over $200 cage, burnt my snake, and then melted itself. Came on here to find the issue was probably the cord being ""pinched"", and that some heaters come with a lifter to prevent this. Obviously this one doesn't. The goddamn thing has ""under the tank"" in its name in the company doesn't think to include an item that will keep the pad from melting your pet to death. Add a housing around the cord for Christ sakes, or reinforce it. What a terribly disgusting flaw.I will not buy anything from this company ever again, and will highly recommend against anyone else doing it."
1,Nearly Worthless,"I bought this heater for a 10 gallon tank, followed all directions, and it only heated the tank up 5 degrees above the surrounding room temperature. This heater should only be advertised as a secondary heat source."
4,"Great, but doesn't work with dimmer.","I'm using it to heat my 20 gal tank 24hrs a day along with a 50W infrared bulb during the day. I noticed my temps were getting kinda high during the day for my Florida King snake, but when I got a lamp dimmer and tried to lower the heat on the pad, it'd just turn off instead. Easy fix though, I put the dimmer on the bulb and got my temp where I wanted so it was only a minor issue. The adhesive works great, way better then the Zilla model which gave up it's bite after less then 24hours. It also gets hotter then the Zilla and consumes less wattage. It comes with bottom raisers for the tank to prevent the cord from being pinched, very thoughtful of them. Owning both this one and the Zilla, I say get this one, it's only $1 more for similar sizes and the trade-off is it works way better.Pros:1. Adhesive very strong2. Comes with raisers3. Power cord is decently long4. Very low power consumption, 5WCons:1. Didn't work with a dimmerConclusion:Better then the Zilla."
4,Side Mounting,"I bought this for my two geckos and it said you can side mount it so I did and it did not do what it said it would so I took it off and I was going to return it but it did not appear to be easy return shipping. So I stuck it to the bottom of the tank and it is much hotter then it was. It appears to be working the way it said it would, just not on the side of the tank. I would buy this again."
3,Under Tank Heater for reptile tank,"Product was very easy to attach, but as a continuous heat source it's just so-so for our 10 gallon tank.During the winter months (we live in Pa and it gets quite cold here) we keep our Gecko's tank on top of one of the radiators and that does a better job at keeping him at the correct temperature. This heating pad is better used in the late summer/early fall months when the temperature starts to drop but before it gets really cold. Unless you have radiators to put your tank on like I do during the winter months, I would suggest looking into a different brand of tank heater if you experience cold winters. We've been using the heater on and off for over a year now and it works just fine as far as durabilitiy is concerned, it just doesn't produce a lot of heat."
4,"One time use be aware, but heats well !","The heat pad is attached to the Hydrofarm thermostat I purchased here. It works well and heats the section of my 20 gallon snake tank but I only have one complaint.***Be aware*** once you stick the pad to the area you choose, it's a one time deal. I wanted to change the location of the ""hot"" side of my tank but the pad is only good as a one time stick on. ""Don't say I didn't warn you""! For that reason I gave it 3 stars, functional though is 5 as it does heat well.The alternative I went to was the 10 watt Flex-watt heat tape. It comes in different sizes and wattages but the advantage is it can be relocated. Amazon sells it but only the 11"" version which is mostly used for side heat, not belly heat."
4,Acceptable,I recently recieved this product and I am not sure if it's going to get warm enough for the winter. I am unsure about the bubbles becoming larger and the heater eventually falling off but the company simply said if that happens to send them the product and they will send another. Over all happy with this product.
2,Not good as primary source.,"My room is at a constant 74 degrees and this heater only raised the temperature of the ""hot side of the tank"" to 79 degrees. This is a ten gallon tank as per specifications. This heater is not sufficient as a primary heat source. Now I will have to ad a warming lamp to raise the temperature even further. This will now be used only as a night heater."
2,Not consistent temperature,"This pad seems to cycle through different temperatures or wattages? I'm not sure, but what I do know is that sometime it is luke warm and sometime its burning hot, so be careful, don't let your loved one(s) get burnt!"
5,Great product at a great price!,"This works great for my 10-gallon terrarium. I read some of the other reviews that said it made it way too warm for their reptiles, but I haven't had any problems with it! Even though I had no problems I would recommend that you pay close attention to the temp of your tank and the way your reptiles react to it though."
1,Garbage,"This was a complete waste of money. We put it on a 10 gallon tank, followed all directions to the letter, and now wish there were a way to get our money back! I can feel SLIGHT warmth if I put my hand directly against the glass on top of it and focus really hard (and if the room is kept at least 80 degrees). It definitely should not be labeled a ""heater"". It seems to do nothing at all if I turn off the heater in the room and let the temp go below 75 in there.HOW does this thing have such a good rating??? And why is there nothing in the description that says it's only supposed to be used under dry tanks? I have a couple of inches of water for my turtles, and it wasn't until this thing was bought, paid for and delivered that I saw that in the directions. It should be stated up front so those of us with aquatic reptiles don't waste our money!"
2,Off the Rails,"Something happened to Lindsay Anderson between O! Lucky Man and Britannia Hospital. They, like If..., are both ferocious satires, but where O! Lucky Man attacked its targets with wit and energy, Britannia is an angry, predictable bludgeon. It's as if all the ingredients in the film are, like half a brain in one particularly witless scene, tossed into a blender, whirled together and served frenetically for nearly two hours. All in all, it's misanthropy times 10, mitigated only by an equally savage, but appropriate, satire of the mad, egocentric doctor's purported improvement on humanity. Remember Anderson for If.. and Lucky Man, but not this."
2,so who did it for free ?,"there is various information stating Mark Hamill and Alan Bates worked for free on this film & also stated in one these reviews that Malcolm McDowell worked for free .did they all do it free or none of them or just some , does someone actually know ?"
1,This movie is ridiculous. It's not funny.,"And it WILL drop your IQ until you become some unknown of the unknown.There is next to no plot and the characters are SO stupid.This movie is NOT funny it's not even good.I don't know how many times I have to tell you how bad it is to convince you to leave this review and never to turn back and not buying this CRAP.I'd say much worse if I were allowed but then again, it'd be tasteless so I'll say that I could make a better movie with a video camera and going around my town interviewing people asking crazy questions off the top of my head.If you're here though you're wondering how this movie is or if others liked it.Some did, but most are smart enough to know better.I'm not gonna rate the cover art and all that because that would be a waste of time, unlike this review cause I just HAD to write this.This movie WILL make you dumber.Isn't that a proven fact by now???-1 stars."
1,Never again,"We have had this T.V for a year and a half. Of course the warranty is only a year. We are seeing green red and white spots over every picture. When you are watching something with dark scenes especially, it looks like a white haze is over the picture. It is there constantly. For a split second when a program comes back on it is clear, and you can see how great the picture would look ( HD ), and then the haze appears. I am VERY disappointed for the price we paid for it that this is happening. I will never again buy a Toshiba television."
1,BIG BLACK SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this Plasma on 11-09-05 and it is now 11-19-06 .... has a one year factory warranty! So when i call tomorrow plan on being SOL!!! Was watching it and then nothing but sound ...picture is black and have noticed some small disorted spots lately but thought it was just directv picture...but guess not....Do not buy if going to not last longer than year !!!! Seeing the other post this ooks to be not good news....any idea how much that power supply part is going to cost??? Thanks for help!!!
1,broken less than 4 yrs old,I bought a toshiba when I moved into my apartment almost 4 yrs ago. last weekend the screen went black but I still had sound. had a repair guy in to tell me the y-board is broken and it will cost almost $900 to fix. While we wait to buy another TV this weekend we've been using my wife's 12 yr old sony TV that works fine. stay away from the Toshiba
1,Blank screen,I have the same problem with a blank screen. I have owned this TV for a little less than two years and yesterday the screen went blank. I called the customer service center and said they have no idea what I am talking about. Do not buy this TV......
1,Toshiba 42HP66 Black Screen - No Picture,We purchased the Toshiba 42HP66 9-3-2006 and did not have any problems until the screen suddenly went black on 6-12-2009. I have read the other posts on this model and based on what I am reading it appears this TV is not worth repairing based on the cost (I have no extended warranty). I have been told by some TV sales Personnel and have also read that it is not cost effective to purchase the extended warranty on TV's. I think I need to rethink this advice. I am very disappointed with Toshiba and will not purchase another product from this company.
1,Never got the chance to try it.,"I ordered it and the first one came broke at the handle and magnet box connection. Amazon gladly told me they would send out a new one which they did. But theres no golden lining on this cloud, the second one came broke again in the same place.But this time Amazon said the problem must be worse than they thought and wouldn't try to send another.I told them all they had to do is send the handle disconnected from the box and let the customer screw them together because the thing was just to big to fit in a regular box when it is put together. Thats why they broke. The drivers or handlers would see this big box and expect it to be heavy and when they would pick it up so easy It must have been too hard to resist showing off in front of the crew. Too bad I really could have used it. Has anyone else gotten one unbroken?"
1,total junk,"I should have known better with the price.This magnetic , well kind of , sweeper is total junk. The wheels are 2 1/2 "" diameter and the magnet is 3/4"" higher than the bottom of the wheels. If you try to use it in grass the grass knocks off the nails it does pickup.My bad for not checking the weight. It only weighs 3.2 lbs. total."
3,did not work as well as i thought,i received the first one broken so they are not that sturdy. when i rec'd my replacement i went out to use it but it really did not work as well as i thought it would in the grass. the grass would knock off some of the nails. i just wish the magnet was stronger. it ended up breaking as well a couple of weeks later.
1,"Backordered, then arrived Broken, cannot return","Firstly, this item was on back order for about 3 months. When I finally decided to not respond to 'accept' an additional new ship date, the item magically was in the mail to me.Secondly, the item arrived broken at the base where the handle meets the roller part.Thirdly, Amazon is not responsible for returns on this item. You must go through the manufacturer and finding that information. The manufacturer was not open to return/refunds and only wanted to ship another one to me. We'll see how the second one does...."
1,Never buy a cheap tool,The title says it all. I bought this to clean up around jobsites and it was useless. The magnet is weak and the handle flimsy. The only time a nail stuck to it was when I held it there. Just wrote this to maybe save someone else the hassel. I hope I can send it back for a refund.
4,tack sucker,"This device is easy to assemble and use. Works very well, although it isn't a heavy duty, commercial type.I used it for cleaning up the pound of roofing tacks that fell on the ground after getting a new roof,then on my driveway when my neighbor got a new roof. It was cheaper than getting tires patched.The wheels make operation easy even for a kid, and the ""dump"" feature allows the metal to be dropped easilyinto a metal recycling bin or garbage. Also fantastic when working on cars or mowers if you drop a bolt,washer or tool."
5,Completely satisfied,I was more than satisfied with the prompt arrival and condition of my new Cuisinart 5-piece starter set. I love it! I love the way it looks and I love cooking with it. Food doesn't stick and washing is easy. What a great price for this set and the delivery was free.
4,Fantastic set for the $$$,I just bought these and I have been very pleased with them. There don't seem to be hot spots and stuff cooks very evenly. Handles and lids don't get hot and the pans clean up easily as well. My only complaint is that the flat lip on the saute pan makes it tricky to flip things - you just have to make sure the pan isn't too full or else stuff falls out.
2,Not as good as the original Canon battery,"Despite having a 1000 mAh rating, my Canon S400 seems to run out of power sooner with this battery than with the stock one."
3,Revised movie,This movie was aired in Japan and proved to be so popular that lines for the theater went around blocks. It was later decided to redo the movie as the Comet Empire saga. Which proved to be a great idea since most of the Star Force cast was killed in this movie including the Yamato getting destroyed. The Comet Empire Saga features footage from this movie and was edited for American viewers to imply certain characters had lived instead of being killed as stated in the movie. So you can buy this movie and The Comet Empire Saga and compare the two.
4,Great Information,Pocket size goes every where. Great basic info oldies but goodies. Used it on many occassions found it to be handy and useful on the job.
5,Moroccan glasses,I love these glasses!! They are just like the pic and are beautifully crafted!! The colors are vibrant and they look beautiful in my moroccan tea room
1,"Advertised as ""new"", it is not!","This CD was advertised as new, shipped from warehouse still in wrapper. It was in fact scratched badly, was not in the original wrapper. Case had been broken as well."
3,Cute Gund Dog,I ordered this as a gift and when it arrived I had to do quite a bit of work to get it up to snuff.It required a lot of trimming and clipping of lose threads and areas where the plush had long patches.After a bit of trimming it looked quite nice. Problem is I didn't feel like it was my job to play barber with a plush toy.The next time I order this type of gift I think it would be better to look at another brand maybe TY or RUSS.
2,An O.K. book,"Overall, I would say that I was disappointed in this book.Predominantly, this book is about the diplomacy between England, France, and Russia. The desciptions of the battles were brief, and mostly seemed to frame the diplomatic discussions. Much of the book was hard to follow as the author introduced diplomats and political leaders throughout the book. It was hard to keep track of who was important and who was only going to show up for a page or 2.If you are intersted in the Crimean War, I would recommend a different book."
4,First World War,"A very thorough documentary but a little dry. I was pleased with the film footage available and was impressed with the diaries of a few civilians who wrote a very accurate account of what took place. A couple of whom were only 10 or 11 years old at the time.For someone who is interested in history, I would recommend this DVD set."
4,The Unknown War,It is embarassing to say but I believe most Americans now precious little about World War I. This DVD was most educational and well worth the time investment for those of you who are uninformed about the subject. I greatly enjoyed it.
4,Fine WW I Doc,"good, solid, always moving along, I would haved liked less multi-repetive news reel footage placed over and over in different battles and situations - using the same footage over and over.Narration good, maybe they could have stayed a bit more chronlogical.But over all outstanding."
4,Excellent Intro to scope of WW1,"This was an informative and well constructed story of a period that is probably destined to be less and less understood as well as its lessons.The impact of WWI was staggering and its legacy gave context to the rest of the bloody century that followed. The events in Iraq today can even be directly linked to the Great War as well as the continuing unrest in the the rest of the Middle East and the Balkans.One of my few criticisms of the series is that I wish they had more of the many great visuals of the battlefields and locations as they are today while narrating the story of what happened so long ago. Visuals of the thousands of monuments and cemetaries would be dramatic testimony to the horrors of this slaughterhouse. I also wish more explanation was provided on the cost and futility of the battles, primarily Verdun and the English disaster at the Somme... Nonetheless this series is a great achievement..."
3,"Good footage, fair assesment of Fedinand's murder, but biased with questionable facts","A good documentary covering a wide variety of topics such as Africa and Asia. Extremely biased after the first episode. As I watched it and after some of the statements I wouldn't have been supprised if the narrator scorned the Germans as baby-eating cannibals. Didn't pay enough attention to the Balkan front or the Austrian's and Hungarian's roles on the eastern front. Gave more credit to the British forces than was deserved, and not enough to the French. It gave no credit to the German Navy and didn't even diversefy the views on Jutland. It left wondering why the Germans were able to win such success if the British were so much more powerful and the Germans were starving from Britains blockade. Not to be insensitive, but far to much attention was given to the suffering of the people, and not enough to battles and tactics"
1,not closed captioned,"This set is not closed captioned nor subtitled, if your deaf like me it is a waste of [...] bucks, I thought it would be CC because it was CC on TV.The two episodes I saw on TV were great and I wanted to see the whole program so bought the set and once I opened the set to check, I could not return it."
2,A mile wide and an inch deep,This series has wide scope and little depth. Far to much time is spent on peripheral issues with huge and important parts of the war neglected all together. The phrase a mile wide and an inch deep is a fitting description of The First World War - The Complete Series.Very unsatisfying.
5,The First World War - A Commendable Effort,"I found this series to be engaging and thoughtfully done. It used a great deal of archival footge I had never seen before. The presentation moved along well, has depth and it avoided the trite anti-war flavor that many programs on this historical event fall pray to. The makers brought forth the tragedy of this conflict while maintaining an even and intelligent presentation of it."
3,Disappointing,"Coverage of that terrible global conflict, although quite extensive, has several flaws in my opinion:1) Narration is apparently non-professional and sometimes indistinct.2) Excellent archival film footage is often jarringly interspersed with modern-day views in color.3) Repeated use of ""speaking heads"" reading from speeches, books, diaries, and so forth, presumably to suggest a sense of live personal presence.4) America's role in the war is minimized. Although its military action was relatively small, the very threat of its growing power helped Germany to realize defeat was inevitable.Contrast this series with the more concise black-and-white 1988 CBS-NEWS version crisply narrated by Robert Ryan."
3,Not the best but it works,This cooler tilts the back of the computer up and then has fans which blow hot air out from underneath the computer. It works pretty well except that our computer has a hotspot on the front left corner and this area remains warm though not as hot as before.
4,"performs well, loud on highest setting","Performs well, tips the laptop up at an angle which personally I prefer for typing. The fan works very well; though I don't monitor my temperatures the air blowing out of the vent on my Asus laptop hasn't been hot since sticking the fan underneath. According to my boyfriend (built his own gaming machine of death PC), this was the best fan for my laptop, providing the most cooling and ventilation, which would in turn lengthen the laptop's lifespan and improve performance."
3,Could be awesome ONNNly if lucky!,"This was my second purchase for the same item because I loved this so bad when i first had it. This time around, However, I got a little disappointed with what i got because it makes a lot of noise when it's running. Be careful! not every item of these shipping from amazon will be a perfect quiet cooler, at least my opinion would lean towards recommending buying it still because it works well and does its job. I wouldn't look for any other type of coolers overpriced and they would take up so much space of your working station."
5,Does the job!,"I bought this cooler because my laptop runs so hot it shuts down after a couple of hours. It has completely eliminated my overheating problem. The unit is quieter than the fan in my computer, even on high.Some laptops may have a problem with the way the cord comes out of the usb plug. It comes out at a 90 degree angle so if you have to plug something right next to it, you may have to go a different route.I highly recommend this cooler."
3,Check laptop vent placment before buying!,After using this for several months I find the product to be ok. My main issue is when the product is placed like it should the fans blow all air to the left side of the laptop leaving the right side hot. Unfortunately the vents on my laptop are mostly on the right side. Good news is this product works pretty much the same upside-down as it does right-side up.The fans are powerful and blow plenty of air. The product is sturdy and well built. The design has some issues and does not evenly distribute the air. This could be a problem for laptops with multiple vents as some might be deprived.
4,Almost perfect,"Small, quiet and keeps my 17"" laptop from shutting down from heat (now that I'm running a second monitor. The USB through-port works fine. Lost a point because it has no off switch."
5,Keeps the laptop cool,Very simple to use. Works great. Top rated on some of the computer review websites.
4,Needs to be heard by more,"This music needs to be heard by more people; it is a shame that there is little airplay or promotion in the USA. Other reviews already provide well-stated info on this CD; so I will simply note that subsequent releases from Hadouk Trio expand upon this first exploration of Hadouk musical ideas to a five-star degree.This CD has less continuity than later releases if heard in sequence, but it has a few gems that one never tires of hearing again & again. The name ""Hadouk"" combines the words 'hajouj,' a Moroccan 3-stringed bass, and 'doudouk,' an Armenian double-reed wind instrument, but the trio makes use of a wide array of instruments to create exuberant, uplifting 'World Music.'Buy this & the other releases before they are no longer available. If you've made it this far to these reviews, you will no doubt be glad you did. And check [...] for much more info, videos, & music."
2,I'd buy a Cheaper Model,"After reading several good reviews, I purchased this item, however, I'd suggest finding a cheaper model elsewhere. It's not all it's cracked up to be.I've tried cold and then heating half n half to several different temperature levels and get very little foam. Even tried adding water to the half n half thinking that might be the problem. I've only managed to get a decent froth on one occasion. It seems that this little tool slows down and then speeds up some reason. Just not consistent. It came with a fresh set of batteries though.Hope you have better luck than I! Seriously, I'd go to IKEA as others have suggested for a cheaper model."
1,Twice DOA!!!,The item arrived dead. Changed batteries but no luck. The battery compartment appeared bigger than battery size because I could feel the batteries moving inside if I shook it. Don't know how a steady power connection can be maintained with such quality of design/manufacturing.Thought of giving it a second chance and asked for a replacement. Amazon re-sent it via overnight shipping which arrived the very next day (5 star to Amazon).THE REPLACEMENT WAS DOA AS WELL!!! SAME LOOSE CONNECTION!!!Returning for refund this time. Would give -ve rating if possible.
3,Fun to use for easy at home latte and cappucino.,"I like this gadget very much and enjoy the drinks I can make with it. One caution: do not immerse in water. The box does not say this. A guest of mine, ""helping"" to clean up, put it under water in the sink and it took me two days to dry it out and replace the batteries before it worked again. Box should be labeled ""do not submerge entire unit in water. Also, the spinner must angled just right in the liquid you are frothing and turned completely off before you take it out or splatters of milk, coffee, or whatever you are frothing travel long distances across the room, walls, cupboards etc."
2,doesn't last,"I bought this for my wife, and she was thrilled with it for about 3 months. It worked great during all that time and then all of a sudden it stopped producing any real froth. It started just producing some bubbles that quickly dissipated, leaving the milk as flat as before. Changing batteries doesn't fix it; it appears that it simply doesn't have the RPM it used to have and can't do the job anymore.Having gone back and reading more of the negative reviews, it seems this is a common thing. Some get their Aerolatte in this state from the get-go and for some it works for a while and then slows down like it did for us. It's such a shame because it worked really well while it lasted. If it was half the price, I might consider buying a new one, but at this price it's just not worth it. I will look for an alternative."
4,Aerolatte - Excellent but Battery Intensive,"Just purchased my second aerolatte (first lasted 3 years before it started running down batteries too fast). Excellent for frothing steamed milk (I put 8 ounces in microwave on high for 1 minute), then froth. Very similar to ""caffe con leche"" in Spain. Product has been reliable --but does take some ""touch"" to avoid spraying milk around the kitchen. Expect 2 double A batteries to last about a month, using 1-2 times a day."
4,Needs More Powerful Turbine,"Make coffee or espresso. Pour milk into coffee cup or other microwavable container. Heat 30 seconds on high. 15-20 seconds of Aerolatte Frother spinning in warm milk transforms milk into froth 2x volume of milk. Use for espresso, capuccino, etc. Two AA batteries. Suggestion for manufacturer: more powerful ""turbine/spinner."" At times thick milk impedes or stops spining of froth wheel"
3,Okay,"I love a nice top on my coffee and this frother, though very nice looking, is a lot milder in whipping then my old one (wish I knew who the maker was, but it was a gift long ago). Had I been able to test this one out first, I would not have bought it."
5,Best I've used,"I bought this because of the reviews. It froths so much better and in half the time than the broken one I am replacing. In fact, I bought another one to keep in the RV. The only precaution I would give is to watch the switch. My previous one had a pulse switch, so when my finger let up the unit stopped. On this one, when it is turned on, it stays on. It took only one time lifting it up in the air and then having to clean up the splatter to learn to use it properly. Other than that, this unit is fantastic and I couldn't be happier with it."
3,Great! until the batteries run out,"This is a great product, BUT as soon as you open it to change the batteries it stops working. This is the 3rd aerolatte milk frother I have purchased, and each one stopped working after opening it to put in new batteries."
4,Fine,"Works fine, but if you're a hardcore coffee fan it wouldn't hurt to spend the extra money on a better quality frother."
1,Don't understand the good reviews,"This gadget does not froth my milk. Tried it cold, tried it hot, followed all the instructions. Just doesn't work. Don't waste your money on this"
3,OK for the money.,"Works good. Stopped working after a couple of weeks. Then after about a week or so began working again. It's been working for the last 3-4 weeks now. Feels a little cheap, but since it's been working lately, I really can't complain - yet."
4,very nice,"works good. sometimes it seems to have not enough power, but that might be a normal. I would buy it again..."
2,This thing really works.,"Who knew, it makes pretty good foam. It's not quite the same as the microfoam you get from a really good espresso machine with a steam wand, but it's a little less expensive too. It can be used for stirring and mixing just about anything liquid too, salad dressings, marinades, drink mixes... All in all a nice product. I'm going to try using it to make a small quantity of homemade mayonnaise over the weekend so we'll see how that goes...**update, after a few months it stopped working. Assuming it got wet or something, no idea but I don't really care since I bought a ""real"" espresso machine recently. Would have expected it to last longer though."
5,Affordable Milk Frother,"Works great every time. This is an affordable way to make a nice latte at home. It's very compact, easy to clean, and can be easily stored in small or tight kitchens. I've paid over $60 for a froth maker 2 years ago that did not even work; however, for less than $20 this one is perfect."
1,"worked 2 times, then broke","I am gentle with my things, and this broke after 2 times use. I tried installing new batteries. Amazon states 5-year warranty but the manufacturer's site had no such information. I must have gotten a lemon, considering the great reviews here. I couldn't return it since I threw away the box. I tried opening it up and saw that there was a small motor. After fiddling with it, if I press down on the motor in a certain way, the frother works. The motor doesn't have enough power to start up. Now I have to stick a bit of tissue inside for better contact and twirl the frother to get it started."
4,Good Froth!!,"The Aerolatte Milk Frother was the hit of Christmas Morning. The recipient was thrilled at how much foam the frother made, much more and much thicker than Starbucks!! The only drawback is that it doesn't work quite as well if the milk is warm. No biggie though!! This little beater definitely left'em foaming at the mouth for more!!"
1,Works great... until it breaks,"It's a great tool for making froth that last for about 10 minutes, but the tool itself isn't water resistant and the contacts corrode for the battery. Meaning that since you'll probably keep it near you sink, in about 2 months it'll stop working. So it's a buy a cheap product now, and then replace in a few months with something more expensive that you should have bought in the first place. Perhaps HIC will read my review and contact me for a replacement, but I doubt it. Buy something better, and save yourself the trouble."
1,Works Good - When it works!,"As of today I am on my 5th one of these. I keep returning them when they stop functioning, which sometimes happens in a few weeks, sometimes in a few months. When it works it works great, though it drains the batteries pretty fast. I promised myself this is my last one and I need to find a product that isn't so incredibly cheap."
4,Frother worth what it's paid for,"For the amount paid for this frother (Under $20) it's well worth the purchase price. When using a whole milk it makes an excellant froth. Just adds something to the overall experience to your everyday cup of ""joe"" for at home!"
1,Cheap crappy product that doesn't work!,"I recieved my frother and it doesn't work, it rattles and I can't even figure out how to open it to change the batterys. I have owned a boujour brand in the past which worked great till it was accidently dropped on the floor. Even broken I was able to duct tape the last one I had and it would work half the time."
1,expectations,"I thought it would also blend, be stronger not just flimsy wires. i wish I read more info about it."
1,Disappointed,"The Aerolatte Milk Frother, satin finish did not come up to my expectations. We already have one and I ordered this for my granddayghter. It looked used and did not come in the case like mine. It did work just looked used!Wanette"
4,Useful for home-latte making,"Froths decently, but tends to slow down a bit once you use up most of the battery. You need a bit of practice to get finer bubbles, instead of the large ones that pop easily. I was not able to make foam animals as one reviewer commented, but I was able to froth until I got about three times the volume :) Overall a decent frother when you don't have an steam wand from an espresso machine :p"
1,"Amazing,..for one week","I was so thrilled with this handy tool and told everyone how great it was. Made my morning keurig coffee that much better with frothed milk. So easy to use and great results. BUT after about one week, it died. I changed the batteries. Nothing. Dead."
1,Defective upon arrival,"This product simply did not work. Maybe the batteries were bad, maybe it was the one defective one they made, since it got good reviews from others. It does feel very cheep though."
1,Not Work,"Change the batteries 4 times in 2 weeks.Have a problem, so it works 3 days and then will not start"
3,Worked great for about a year,"This worked great for about a year of random usage and 2 months of daily usage. Started to just get bubbles, so I changed the batteries. Didn't help.I wouldn't mind this kind of record if it was cheaper, but at $20, that's a bit excessive."
3,"Works. fast, cheap but not great","The wand frother on my machine has been acting up so I decided to give this a try after one of my friends raived about how great this was. The device is very fast, inexpensive and does froth milk. This is a good solution for someone looking for a cheap way to froth milk. The reason for the 3 stars is that it just does not compare to what I am use to using. The milk is cold so you have to heat it up after the fact. The foam is for some reason does not get the good texture/consistancy I am use to getting on my other system. I will probably keep using this until I find another solution or fix my current system."
4,Great foam if you have the right technique,"This is a great foam maker - if you have the right technique. If you don't sink the Aerolatte deep enough into the milk, you will have too rough bubbles, and too deep will just stir the milk ;) We have the feeling that the batteries don't last very long, but on the other hand we use it every day for 8 weeks..."
2,Doesn't work after only a month,I loved the Frother until it just stopped working about a month after I got it. I thought it might be the battery so I put new batteries in and still doesn't work. It barely spins so it's useless now.
5,Best gadget in my kitchen,"I've been using this daily for over two years and I love it! I microwave a little milk in my mug and after a four-second buzz with the Aerolatte I pour my coffee into the tall, thick foam. It couldn't be easier. The batteries do last a long time. I've only changed them two or three times when it started taking 10 whole seconds to do the job."
4,Great product,It is a great product. Really easy to use. I would recommend this product to any one. I like how it comes with a recipe book.
2,Aerolatte Milk Frother,I can't get this to do much but put some air bubbles in the milk. Even with new batteries. It was a disappointment.
2,not up to the task,Hard to slide the on button. Weak performance. Other brands are better. It does make froth but not stiff enough to stay on top of the coffee.
3,Not a great purchase,It was great for as long as it worked and for the price. Unfortunately didn't last very long. I wanted something that would replace something much more expensive. Did not hold up.
5,SWEET!!!,"Heat up a coffee cup with about 3 oz of milk and if you have a sweet tooth put some sugar with it then go to town with this thing. Just put it in the heated milk and turn it on, make sure you give it a little time to thicken up the milk before you start pulling it up. Make sure to read the review about making froth animals. Best review ever! Take a look at all the pictures, this really does what it claims."
5,Still Frothering,Recommended by a friend. A great item to enhance your coffee or latte. Fun for kids too in drinking frothed milk.
3,Frothy price?,"Works wonderfully--produces LOTS of froth--but as other reviews have noted, price here seems puffed up like the foam.(I think IKEA, e.g., carries the identical item and asks much less.)Other than this-- moderate battery life, easy to use, great results."
2,Not great,"This is the second one I've owned. The first one worked well for the first two weeks, then the switch became harder and harder to use. Then it broke altogether. I thought may be I got a rotten apple so I tried another one. This one worked ok then after a week the switch has become very difficult to use. I would try a diffent brand. We had one with a switch you pressed as opposed to one that clicks on, that lasted for a great while. I'm probably just unlucky."
2,lasted a month,"This worked great but only lasted a month.... I liked it enough that I will try another. To be honest, I did drop mine one day...but it worked after that for a couple of weeks. I will try another but if it fails this next time, you will all hear!"
1,Unreliable product and company,"Product lasted just under 5 months. Previous one lasted 5 years. I used the new one in exactly the same manner as the previous one. Company wants me to send it back (TO ENGLAND) and they'll fix it IF THEY CAN! What sort of one year warranty is that? Buyer Beware: do not buy from a foreign company which does not have an address in this country.Aerolatte Milk Frother, Satin FinishGreen Lane Products Ltd. is the name of the company. They make different models, all basically the same."
4,Surprisingly Good!,It's a small inexpensive item that really does a good job frothing milk for your lattes.
1,Disappointed!,I have only had this for a weeks and I have to return it. It pooped out on me and I'm very disappointed. I'm returning it sometime this week. It worked great for the first 2 weeks and loved it for my morning coffee. Then it just died out. I replaced the batteries and still not making any foam.
5,Works great!,This little thing works great! Gets an awesome froth on the milk! If you are making any kind of latte at home I greatly recommend the Aerolatte Milk Frother.
2,Broke after 2 months,This did perform very well in terms of frothing milk beautifully - but it has ceased to work after only two months. on/off switch isn't making a connection.
3,Short Lifespan,"I am on my 4th aerolatte frother. I love it, but generally 6 months after purchase, it stops working. You can open the top and fiddle with the metal connectors, but that's only good for a short time. Just wondering if anyone elsehas experienced this problem. The Aerolatte frother is better than other hand held frothers, such as Bon jour and Black & Decker. Yet I'm disappointed that it has such a limited life. That said, I'm about to order another one!"
3,Nice Little Milk Frother,"The Aerolatte Milk Frother is really cool. I love that it is small, sleek, and that it can get cleaned easily. The only reason I gave it a 3 is because I did expect it to a bit more powerful. I also had the assumption that it could be re-charged or it had a plug, but it's only battery powered. Other than that, I do enjoy using this for my (attempted) latte art!"
1,Does not foam milk,This milk frother does not froth. It spins around and makes some large bubbles but no foam. when poured it has nothing at all in the way of froth. do not buy. I will return mine.
5,Fun gadget!,"Lightweight, easy to use, clean and store. It so handy in the morning turning a plain old cup of coffee into something special and frothy. I bought it just for that but have found a couple of other handy uses: small portion of whipped cream fast and good for emulsifying salad dressings too."
1,"Works one time then stops, even after battery replacement","The ONE time this frother worked, it did froth milk pretty well, although even at that time, it was erratic and hesitant, then stopped completely. Because of the hesitation, I tried replacing the AA batteries with brand new ones. It did not even turn on after that. I sent it back for a refund. I may yet find another milk frother that works, but I won't try Aerolatte again."
4,Works better than expected,"Don't care for the switch location or operation, but other than that, this would be a 5 star item. Works well with cold or warm milk!"
1,Doesn't work after repeated uses!,"I originally loved this item! I thought that our days of Starbucks were over! It really worked well the first couple of times that we used it. However, after about 10 uses, it did not froth the milk any more. I was very disappointed!! There was not any reason as to why it stopped 'frothing'. It was not damaged in any way. I returned it. I would not recommend it at all."
1,18 dollars??,"Ridiculous price for this. A very popular Swedish Home Furnishing store sells this similar frother for 3 dollars. YES, 3 dollars only."
4,Can't mow the lawn with it,"It's a cute frother if you're going to froth a cup of milk. I've used mine only a handful of times. I find it's true with other 4 rated reviews that you can't put the stem that deep into the milk, it needs to be closer to the surface to deliver a better froth. It feels fragile and the handle is plastic, so has a cheap look to it.Maybe I should use it more often but I think if I were that serious about froth, I'd get a expresso machine that will froth much better than this handheld device."
2,IKEA for much less,"Decent, if not perfect, frother. Batteries die moderately quickly. Ummm... like previous post, this thing is $1.99 (or maybe $3.99) at IKEA."
4,it's worked well for 2 years,We bought 2 yrs ago from amazon and it's still running. recently we found it wasn't spinning as fast and emitted a squeeking sound. i sprayed a bit of wd-40 on the axle and it seems to be good as new now.
5,Latte foam addict!,"Aerolatte deserves a TEN!! 10 stars!!! AAAA+++++ Very easy to use, delivers the BEST froth, much better than any machine. I have bot 2 expresso machines one of which was a Starbux! Very disappointed in the froth with Starbux. Aerolatte delivers VOLUMES of RICH, SATIN, FROTH. Takes only a minute to heat the milk in the microwave, doesn't need to be extremely hot, use the Aerolatte for a minute or 2 in the heated milk and for 1/4 cup of milk or less it will give you at least 2-3 times the froth!! GREAT PRODUCT! I LOVE IT!!!The only improvements would be something that's not battery operated and if it came with a container to heat the milk, but overall I am extremely pleased. For $15 vs over $200 for an expresso machine, it's GREAT!!"
5,"Whip it, whip it good.",I love this product and use it every day. I make espresso coffee in the afternoon and whip up a froth like a pro. Now everyone wants a cappucino in the afternoon. It is figure friendly since you only have to use very little milk and skim milk for even less calories.
5,Milk Frother,We replaced another frother with this one and we were pleasantly surprised at how well this one works. Great product.
5,"Oh, boy !! Capuccinos at home !!","After picking up this great little gadget, I can now wake up to the real thing, and not spend $$$ every day, and time waiting in line. Love it !!"
4,Works Great - 5 year warranty,This unit works great. I purchased this to replace the Bonjour frother I had which stopped working. The Bonjour unit had a very poor warranty and had to be thrown out. This unit has a 5 year warranty.The only drawback is the position of the on/off switch yet not a deal killer.
3,"Works, but not as quick","It will froth your milk, but not nearly as fast as the video shows. Worth the money though."
5,Love my frothed milk,"This product can create foamy milk in seconds without the mess of complex machines using steam. For the price, this is a must have."
3,Great while it worked,"I loved using it, and it was everything it claimed to be. Unfortunately, after about five months of frequent use (at least 3 times a day), it stopped working. I've used new batteries, of course, and even put aluminum foil in to increase the contact. It seemed to be a question of the contacts because sometimes, if I pushed hard on the top, it worked. I've given up. Might still buy another, but I do think there's a problem."
1,Already dead,"I bought this frother 6 months ago and it worked great. It started slowing down, so I put new batteries in and the thing just died. Also, unless you froth in a deep glass, the milk will spill out. Also, unless this frother is set at just the right angle, the milk will splatter. I'm not buying this brand again."
5,A real fizzy whizzy!,"The price ($9.95) was great. Delivery speedy. One for myself, one as a gift. Both are appreciated and used every day. So easy to clean."
5,GREAT PRODUCT AND INEXPENSIVE!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS CLEVER DEVICE TO FROTH MILK WHEN I MAKE CHAI LATTE. I JUST MIX 1/2 TAZO CHAI LATTE CONCENTRATE (I BUY AT TARGET) WITH 1/2 2% MILK AND THEN ADD SOME EQUAL SWEETENER AND MIX WITH A STIRRER. THEN, MICROWAVE TO WARM. AFTERWARDS, I USE THE AREOLATTE FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS TO MAKE A GREAT FROTH. PERFECT!!! JUST AS GOOD AS STARBUCKS CHAI LATTE FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE. I EVEN TAKE THE AEROLATTE TO WORK SOMETIMES SINCE IT'S SO SMALL AND BATTERY OPERATED. I'M SURE THIS WOULD ALSO WORK GREAT FOR COFFEE LATTES AND HOT CHOCOLATE. MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE AND PORTABLE THAN THOSE FANCY MACHINES AND YOU GET THE SAME RESULT. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
4,I like it!,"I have used this over and over. My kids like to use it for chocolate milk and cocoa, but i used to froth milk for coffee. I have found that 2% percent milk works the best for me."
1,Junk plastic,"Plastic body is splitting at seam. Battery door is loose.Stopped working after a few uses.Our other BonJour unit feels much more solid, and has long outlasted this junk. I wouldn't have bought this one if I had been able to see its cheap construction in the store."
3,only works sometimes,"cheaply made, gets the job done when it works, which is not all the time. I guess for the price it was good, but wouldnt buy again"
1,Just awful,"You will labor to make the froth for much longer than anticipated, only to have it go completely flat in less than 30 seconds. This is a great disappointment."
1,Lame. My cheapo one worked better.,"I had a frother thing that I bought for $10 which was AWESOME. But it died. So, I bought this as a replacement. This one is completely and utterly WEAK compared to my old one. My old one was super-powerful and whipped up ANYTHING. It NEVER slowed down not for a second - I whipped up FAT FREE MILK once - it was THAT good. This one - this one is terrible! I had it in a small glass of CREAM and it sounded like it died once it went into the liquid about an inch deep!! Like it was griding away just to keep up! Took FOREVER to whip it up and even when it did, it didn't stay whipped for long. I hate the design: The SLIDER switch on the SIDE? I mean now when you are done whipping something you need TWO HANDS! One to hold it steady and the other to reach down and slide the switch off! I think this one is a complete rip off. For almost $20 - I'm speechless. Bad design, weak motor (yes I used new batteries and followed instructions!) - please PASS on this lame thing."
5,"6 months in, fantastic device at a great price","This device does exactly what it advertises, at an extremely reasonable price. It's also very compact and easy to store, easy to clean, and narrow enough to reach into narrower bottles or cups. I tried a devoted frothing unit with pitcher and was disappointed, then chose this and have been extremely happy.Use this frother, along with a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker and your own skim milk, plus whatever other ingredients you like, and you have Starbucks for about a quarter (or less) of the retail price.For me, it's Illy Moka Normale coffee in the Bialetti, microwaved skim milk, one long shot of sugar-free Hershey's chocolate syrup, and a dollop of Starbucks peppermint syrup, then froth with the Aerolatte. Starbucks Peppermint Mocha at less than a dollar and 130 calories instead of 4.79 and 350 calories."
1,Disappointed -don't waste your money,"What a disappointment - I used it twice and was just OK with its performance - the third time I tried to use it it did not start -I changed the batteries and it worked once more. Now -nothing. I did not get it wet, drop it or in any other way do anything to it. Did not really froth milk all that well (a small hand wisk works better)-and seems unreliable. Don't waste your money."
3,Eh..,"Worked ok, didn't do everything they advertise it to do but it frothed some slightly microwaved rather easily. One day I accidentally dropped it in a water filled sink and it never worked again. No reason for such cheap casing that a 5 dollar electric toothbrush can beat."
2,Stopped Working Properly in a Month,"I loved this frother for about 30 days, then it failed. A change of batteries did not help. I thought it was a bargain, until I realized how poorly made it is. I'd rather spend 4 times the amount and have it work for more than a month. A huge disappointment."
2,works while it lasts - about 6 months.,I used to consider these disposable items cause they would last for about 6 months. Then I found the black and decker which is cheaper and much more solidly built. Much better than aerolatteBlack & Decker Multi-Use Beverage Frother
1,aerolatte frother,"I wasn't pleased with this particular frother. I have used a friend's, which is the exact same frother, in the past, & hers is much better. This one doesn't do anything but stir my coffee...there is no frothing, and the entire unit shakes while trying to do so. It was too much of a pain to mail back, so I just bit the bullet on losing the money."
2,arrived with dead batteries,"This seems strange -- the frother arrived with two Aerolatte AA batteries, but it wouldn't turn on. And yes, I'd removed the protective plastic battery tag. When I replaced those batteries with AAs I had on hand, it worked. I can only conclude the batteries included were dead."
1,This item stinks,I've been using milk frothers for years and this one by far is the worst. They are all problematic since they break after six months but this one lasted three days. I'm buying an aeroccino. I'm tired of being had.
1,junk,"I was quite excited to try this out after reading all the reviews.However straight out of the package it is DOA. Tried replacing the batteries and still nothing. So I cannot comment on it's frothing abilities.But the product itself is very cheaply made. The on/off switch is really hard to switch, I can't imagine actually holding this in milk and trying to switch it off without making a mess.Definitely a cheap plastic-ky feel to it!Returning this one for a refund!"
3,Not so good,This product doesn't last long if it gets in contact with water and it falls apart every time it is dropped. Not the best...
1,Spindle slightly bent now it's useless,"I bought this brand milk frother but paid $5.00 extra to get a little case for it that fits over the spindle head. The second time I went to get it out of the drawer, I picked it up from the top of the case and the unit slid out. I caught it before it crashed to the floor but while clutching it to my body, like some star quarterback, it skewed ever so slightly. Now the thing is useless. $25.00 down the drain. What a waste of money. It is so flimsy I really wonder how long it would have taken the thing to bend - floating around in the drawer with my other numerous kitchen gadgets - as I sometimes have to root around in there to find items."
1,Broken,The Aerolatte Milk Frother arrived broken. I am not sure whether it was broken in transit or before being mailed.
3,Did not froth my almond milk,So bummed. I assumed this would work with almond milk as well. I tried it a few different times as well as with 2 different kinds of almond milk (refigerated and shelf-stable) and it would initially froth but 30 seconds later it would all be gone. I will try with coconut milk or rice milk to see if there is a difference.
3,RHP redone - mediocre result,Sabrina Setlur does a cover version of the Roedelheim Hartreim Projekt song. It's ok and the video deals with death penalty. But this song didn't bring her back to the peak of her career
3,"Bought 4 - three work well, 4th one was defective","We bought four of these earlier this week, four of them seem to work fine, we are please with them so far (we have them outside and they have not gotten wet at this point). The fourth rope, is defective and the outside sheath slides up and down loosely on the rope core and we are requesting a replacement."
3,Not as advertized,"The working load on the rope we received was listed 135 pounds, while the description on Amazon says 244 pounds. We still plan on keeping it as rope is always pretty useful, but it means we couldn't use it for the purposes we intended."
3,Good rope. Cheaper if bought local,"Like some of the other reviews say, it's a good ""all around rope"" for random uses while camping or strapping stuff down. Con: I found it for only $9.99 at Home Depot so I wish I had found it before purchasing here but oh well"
3,Gets the job done,"Adequate load bearing, great for lashing, not great for hanging loads, it dries very quickly though. My only hang up is that colors are at random."
4,Worth the wait,"Ace was selling this for twice the price in the local store. Took a few weeks to get here, but was exactly what we needed. I made monkey fist drawer pulls with it. Wife was happy. If you're not in a hurry its worth the wait."
2,It's Okay.,"The quality of the recording is lacking, and the singers are sub-par as well. I had expected better, especially with an Opera as beautiful as this one."
5,a hundred stars!,"A soulful, utterly absorbing look at the world of Paul Klee. Not only does the film not shy from Klee's interior life, it revels in revealing it - through his paintings, journals, writings, drawings. Even Klee's extensive cataloguing habits are examined with love. I agree with another reviewer there has been no film like this made about an artist before. It's devastatingly fine, beautifully made. The film's riveting cohesion openly resembles Klee's paintings - Michael Gaumnitz's understanding of Klee's work is huge, and the rituals with which he attends his subject are profound. Presentation of the art is wondrously crafted. Every frame is a joy to watch and pulls the viewer deeper and deeper into the heart of Klee's own wonder. It's a remarkable experience indeed. To understand Klee, indeed to love him, is to see this perfectly revealing film. A hundred stars!"
4,Master of visual music,"This DVD is for fans of Paul Klee. Ever since I saw a small watercolor of his at the MFA in Boston, I have been obsessed with this artist for his draftsmanship and ability to relate art and music. This DVD provides a great background to how the artist developed his methods of production and is a treat to those of us who are really entranced by his work."
3,Personal Opinion Only,"I was not really that impressed with this effort. Michael'svoice is technically on-point however, the way he interpretsJimmy's lyrics just leave something to be desired. Gems include""Belmont Avenue"", ""Piano"" and ""All Of The Loves Of My Life/ OnlyOne Life."" People more interested in Jimmy Webb's full-length collaborations should also seek out The Fifth Dimensions ""Magic Garden"", Thelma Houston's beautiful (and underrated) ""Sunshower""as well as Richard Harris' ""A Tramp Shining"" and Jimmy's owncd ""Suspending Disbelief."""
2,I think it's time for a live album.....,"I just saw Michael Feinstein live @ Davies Symphony Hall in SF....he is MUCH better live, and I have no idea why he hasn't released a live album yet. The only studio album I've loved is ""Isn't it Romantic""....every other including this most recent release don't come through for me - I end up feeling either disinterested or sleepy. Michael Feinstein is so entertaining - and funny! - but you wouldn't really know it from his albums alone. Go see him live...I wasn't a die hard fan of his until after that concert."
2,Snooze,"I'm afraid I have to join the chorus of naysayers on this. I love Michael, and have most of his work, but I just cant get into this CD. Have yet to listen to this all the way through at one sitting. What went wrong? I love his Songbook compilations, but this puts me to sleep. I dont think the problem is Jimmy Webb, as I like many of his songs, but the song choices and arrangements. Does everything have to be sung so SLOW and dirgelike? Even Up, Up and Away gets this treatment. Why are there no uptempo songs? Compare Linda Ronstadt's versions of Adios and Moons a Harsh Mistress and Art Garfunkel's All I Know and you get my drift. I'm giving this 2 stars, but I'm being generous. Hopefully Michael will get back on track with his next release."
1,SOMEONE CALL GLEN CAMPBELL!!!,"Not even Webb's beautiful music and lyrics can overcome Feinstein's over-the-top delivery. Imagine a ""Saturday Night Live"" parody of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and that's pretty close to what you'll find here. I laughed out loud. If you want to hear ""Adios"", pick up Linda Ronstadt's version; ""All I Know"" is much better in Garfunkel's hands. And if you want to hear ""The Moon's a Harsh Mistress"", Glen Campbell is the man. In fact, if you want to hear Webb's tunes given justice, pick up Campbell's ""Reunion"" LP or Webb's own ""Ten Easy Pieces"". This one is just ugly."
3,Not very good.,"It's bigger than I expected. For some reason the LCD display is at the bottom of the clock, so you can't glance over and tell the time without hitting the top button to hear it. But the worst part is that when you hit the top button, there is an annoying loud buzz sound before the time is announced. Why? I don't need a loud buzz to make me even more awake when I check the time during the night. And last, the person announcing the time has an asian accent which makes it hard to hear what she says sometimes. And the sound quality is not very good either. However, it does the job."
4,Tel-Time Pyramid Talking Alarm Clock,We purchased the product for my father-in-law who has advanced stage macular degeneration. It works well for him.
2,Not For Me,"I ordered this item for my 97 year old dad. It would probably be ok for most people, but not for my father. He not only has visual problems, but hearing problems, also. It was easy for him to hit the black strip on top to hear the time, but he can't understand what is being said. The voice is somewhat garbled to me, and my father can't understand it at all. He'll press it 4 or 5 times and then ask me what was said. I bought a Reizen 3-in-1 talking cube for him for Christmas and it works perfectly. The voice is loud and clear. I guess I'll just have to bite the bullet and get another one of those instead of carrying the one he has now back and forth between the bedroom and the den."
2,It's perfect if you do not want an hourly report!,Just what the title says: It's perfect if you do not want an hourly report! You have to push the top to get it to talk. I sent it back and got a different one with an hourly report. I love that one!
2,Nothing to get excited about,"We ordered the clock to replace one which had to be at least 20 years old that announced the time hourly on it's own. The old one announced the time and even though we could have called or waited for a reponse, we got one that is just an alarm clock. We contacted the company via email, and said to check their site for one - but no offer of returning this one and paying any difference."
2,NOT David Binney's group called Lost Tribe,"Be warned . . . this is not a recording by David Binney's group called Lost Tribe. This is an entirely different group. As of current writing, Lost Tribe (featuring David Binney) has three recordings out: Lost Tribe, Soulfish, and Many Lifetimes."
3,Inspiring,"It was neat reading about Michael's upbringing and how, despite all odds, he came to know the Lord. I was inspired to see how God was there working in his heart and in his life. It seemed really evident to me! I wasn't as impressed with his 2nd wife's story - she didn't seem to have any loyalty to what she believed and she seemed extremely codependent. I also felt he didn't give his first wife justice in his story. All we knew was that he didn't really love her and left when he found someone ""better."" I also wondered whatever happened to his children with his first wife. Did he ever see them again - I wouldn't know that from reading his story. Overall, I did appreciate his story - it's exciting to hear someone from the mob give their testimony!!"
2,A better interview than book,"I bought the book after hearing the author interviewed on the radio. He was phenomenal on the radio so maybe my expectations were too high. I felt like possibly he still couldn't tell the full story while reading the book. Also, while I respect very much his pursuit of his religion, the last third of the book got too preachy for me."
2,Disappointing Read,"This book is GREAT for the first half. He details his dealings with the mob and the law. He is obviously a brilliant man who could have succeeded at any endeavor he attempted and the first half of the book was rivating. Then he finds Jesus. And spends the second half of the book testifying about his relationship with Jesus over and over again. He writes it well but if I want to listen to someone testify I can go downtown and listen to a street Preacher. I am afraid I will get comments condemning me to burn in Hell but I have to ""call 'em as I see 'em""."
3,OK,"For those who like books about the mob this is a reasonably good book. Be prepared though, Franzese is VERY determined to convince you that you should become a religous fanatic like him, and that because he is a true believer today, all his past sins are now forgiven. It is understandable why he would have that view on things, but depeding on your belief system, it becomes a bit of a drag in the end.However, he is a great story teller and the book is easily read."
2,Goodfellas in writing,"If you are not interested in snoring through 404 pages of garbage, add Goodfellas to your Netflix rental que. I mean this guy must have seen that movie ten thousand times, because his story goes line by line and phrase by phrase from that box office thriller and he still proclaims he had nothing to do with the death of numerous people close to him. I think he talks about religion far too much considering that he robbed people and did several stints in Federal prisons across the country. I don't buy much of his nonsense. I tell it how it is and that is the truth."
5,Blood Covenant,"I haven't had time to read it; however, Michael Franzese spoke at Central Christian Church in Las Vegas and captured our interest. I've been job searching so that's why I haven't read it.The book arrived faster than expected and the price was great."
3,A good read but........,Lets just say he has a lot more he could and won't say.I felt when reading this I was the one being conned.This guy is very good at what he does.......Making money.
1,Don't buy this book!,"First of all, let me tell you Brian Michael Bendis is one of my all-time favorite writers, and this is the first time he dissapoints me. His Daredevil run is stellar, but this story is mediocre. The art is VERY good in my opinion, even though its definately an aquired taste. Rob Haynes is a very unique artist, but the story makes this book not fun or interesting. Im a BIG DD fan, and of all the Daredevil stories ive ever read, this just might be the worst.On the other hand, get all of Bendis' run on the Daredevil ongoing, which just keeps getting better and better, and is in my opinion even better that Kevin Smith's run and even Frank Miller's run. Read the following Daredevil trades for the TRUE Bendis experience: Underboss, Out, Lowlife and Hardcore."
1,Pointless and Boring,This has to be the worst Daredevil story I've ever read. I can't imagine how a writer could waste such a good character. Lame writing and goofy cartoony art plague this book from start to finish. ...
1,Not a fun book and also dated,"This book may have a lot of historical background on the Burgundy area, but it has not been updated in many years, and is layed out in a really dull way. Flipping through a travel book should make a person exicted to be going to this place. This book just made me want to read something else. The Signpost Guide to Burgundy is much more current, contains a lot of the same historical background on the region, and has a lot more pratical information."
4,Insight ful,"A great book that gets into the details of the movie. As a non-Catholic, I appreciate the open, honest insights to which scenes were strictly from the Gospels, which were artistic developments and which scenes came from the writings of a mystic nun."
5,A Great Book!,This book is actual written by John Bartunek. He is a priest with wonderful insites. He speant a great deal of time on the set when it was being filmed and during the editing. This is a great companion to the movie.I Loved this book so much I bought a copy for my mother and myself as well- and I will probably being buying them for a few people I know this year (just before) Easter.I Hope that he writes more books in the future.
4,Neo-Soul and Polished Praise,"Lisa McClendon's Soul Music is much more polished with better musical quality and production than her last effort. I gave this album four stars because it is not flawless. As much as I love songs about family conflict, ""Stuck (Love's Anthem)"" is really as irritating as it gets, and ""Old School"" is way too long -- it runs its course two minutes before the end.However, the beautiful, soulful gems include ""Grace, Grace, Grace,"" the interlude ""Vibe Out,"" ""Go""--which is really three songs in one, ""Has Anybody Seen Love,"" ""More Than A...""--which I think is about as PERFECT a song ever written, and ""Capture,"" which is truly lovely. These songs more than make up for the lesser ones and the obligatory Integrity songs she had to include because of her contract.Overall, very satisfying album."
5,LOVE IT!!! BETTER THAN THE FIRST!!!!,"I love this cd. The first cd was pretty good. But this one is off the chain. I love ""Soul Music"", ""Breathe"", and tracks 11 and 12. And I love her version of ""You are holy"". This cd is Awesome."
5,Different,"I don't think I've heard anyone like her in the gospel arena. We need more ""soul music"" and her cd is a great start. She will remind you somewhat of a Lauryn Hill type in her style and voice. Go out and get the c.d. there's nothing like it."
5,One of my best CDs,"Musical, professional, soulful, impacting, Biblically sound lyrics. What more could you ask for? Her reach and insight into the Christian walk along with the quality of the recording is great.Only concern - some might say all of her sound tracks sound alike. I might somewhat agree but if you have a great thing then why change it."
5,Awesome,"This album is simply awesome. It stays in my CD player. I know all the words because I play it all the time. What a blessed young lady. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!! And no, I'm not related to Lisa nor am I being paid to say this."
5,Excellent!,"Alright, all you Lisa McClendon fans, ya'll know this CD is the Neo Soul hit of 2003!I was so impressed. She is so talented. When you hear one song, you think it you've heard her best, and then the next one comes on, and you are like, whoa!If you haven't bought it already, buy it today. You will not be disappointed."
5,AWESOME,"I've been waiting for this style of CD. Lisa McClendon has done an excellent job of making a gospel CD that appeals to people who are into Afrocentric, Soulcentric, Truthcentric music.I'm waiting for more artists like her to come out, but for now, I'm going to wear this CD out!"
5,Annother Masterpiece from Commissioned,"""Commissioned chose to do something people have lately gone away from--make a FULL album of great work"" You are so right!!!!This album is wonderfull, ""One Love"" was my wedding song that song is so powerfull, I highly reccomend this CD to everybody this is a must have"
4,Hanging in there!,"Time & Seasons is a good come back for the veteran named group. It has some wonderful tracks that bring you constantly in the Spirit of Praise and Worship. I feel though that Commissioned should not leave the live band feel, that kept them so much on the top of gospel music. Although Fred, Maxx, Michael Brooks, and Michael Williams have long been off the scene, it was songs like ""Back in the Saddle"", ""Dare to Believe"", and the majority of their earlier projects that made them who they are. That is the only thing missing for this project as well as Irreplacable Love. As well, this is a must have, and for those Montrell, and Marvin fans, Marcus, ( another ""M"" ) holds the fort down more than enough. I hope Mitchell will continue to be the strong hold to my favorite group of all times, because I would love to hear more from these guys. (Pa)"
5,ONCE AGAIN!,"All I can say is AMAZING. I didn't think they could match their last album but they did. The lyrical content is mind blowing. God is smiling down on this album for sure. This is where Boyz II Men picked up their vocal styles. If your a new Commissioned fan I suggest getting ""Irreplaceable Love"" as well. Boyz II Men wrote on that album and it is beautiful. This is a MUST BUY!"
4,HUDSON Sprayer repair parts,"This HUDSON 69941 repair kit was just what I wanted to repair my HUDSON sprayer back to working condition. Thanks,"
4,Empirical Social Work Practice,This is a great reference for the latest evidence based practices organized by disorder. It is getting a little outdated but in general still is of a great price and has good information.
3,Cyber Miike!,"A girl, growing away from her friends, doesn't have a second chance at wronging her rights in this life. Luckily her father is an expert software designer who has created her virtual memory and form. She is reborn in cyberspace on her boyfriends laptop. Her brother is also a programing genius, dying literally, for the software. The greedy, selfish bad guys try to steal this software, and the chase begins. Quite different for Miiike with virtual reality as a theme. Not a fast paced film, but unique in its ideas considering that kind of capability really exists. A funny boy band scene is thrown in. Check out City of Lost Souls and Ichi the Killer (Unrated) for more from this cool director."
5,"Uplifting, Soulfull, Christian Artist","I first heard Greg Long on a Christian music show. The song was ""Think about Jesus"" and I knew I had to have to CD. No local record stores had it, so I had to order it On-Line. If you are a Christian or just like uplifting music, this is a great CD. If you have a little faith and are going some through hard times or not, Buy This CD."
5,Revelation Revealed,"This was an excellent read, goes in detail of Biblical prophecy. Gives you Scriptures to go to follow the train of thought!"
5,INFORMATIVE,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INFORMATIVE, EASY TO UNDERSTAND, EASY TO READ BOOK ON PROPHECY. I ENJOYED EVERY WORD ON EVERY PAGE & HAVE PASSED IT ON TO OTHERS WHO NEED OR WANT TO KNOW."
1,Historicity vs Theology,"van Impe grasps frantically for any kind of connection and he proves nothing but that his imagination is top notch and that presupposition is his method. He seems to be picking up the leftovers of Hal Lindsay's failed ""prophecies."" If you want to know what Revelation means, read Crisis and Catharsis by Adella Collins. This is a scholarly but readable book on revelation."
4,A solid release.,"Heart ""Greatest Hits/ Live"" #13 (1981).""Greatest Hits/ Live"", is Heart's first retrospective and it is a collectable. You get most of the hits and live numbers in medley ""I'm Down""/Long Tall Sally"" and Zeppelin's ""Rock 'N' Roll"". They had a small hit in ""Tell It Like It Is"", #8 hot 100 with a 40's feel."
4,Good From the Heart,"Don't get me wrong, they looked a lot better in the 80's with stilletos and all that make-up, and puffy hair that could raise any skyscraper, but old Heart is a hell of a lot better than their newer stuff. I thought they sounded like they meant it like: Crazy On You, Barracuda, Straight On, Heartless (my favorite from them). Yep these vixens who were compared to Led Zeppelin as a hell of a rock band, boy oh boy, pretty damn close I might add. Anyways this album kicks serious butt."
4,"All the hits, and great live treats too!","All of Heart's 70s hits are here, from the hard-rockin' Barracuda and Straight On to the melodic ballad Dog & Butterfly. And some wonderful live recordings. The live version of Mistral Wind is simply beautiful, all eight minutes of it. Starts out slow, and builds to an incredible crescendo. Their tribute to Led Zep drummer Jon Bonham, Rock & Roll, is exactly what the name implies. Sweet Darlin and Long Tall Sally are also live rockers worth mentioning. If you get this one, you won't be sorry."
3,Heart Greatest Hits,"This collection has all of Heart's big hits from the 1970s and thankfully was released before the group's series of terrible songs in the 1980s. There is, however, one major flaw: the c.d. has omitted Heart's live rendition of ""Unchained Melody,"" which appeared on the cassette version of the same title. Ann Wilson's voice coupled with that song was absolutely incredible; it alone was worth the price of the cassette."
2,SKIMPY ON THE EARLY MATERIAL,"at 73:39 here is the track listing.... 1) CRAZY ON YOU (original) 2)ALL I WANNA DO IS MAKE LOVE TO YOU 3) IF LOOKS COULD KILL 4)NEVER 5) ALONE 6) WHO WILL YOU RUN TO 7)STRAIGHT ON (acoustic/live) 8 MAGIC MAN (original) 9)WHAT ABOUT LOVE 10)DREAMBOAT ANNIE (original) 11)DOG & BUTTERFLY (acoustic/live) 12)NOTHIN' AN ALL 13)HEARTLESS (original) 14)STRANDED 15)WILL YOU BE THERE (IN THE MORNING) 16) THESES DREAMS 17 BARACUDA (live)IF YOU'RE A FAN OF HEART'S EARLIER MATERAL (76-83)PASS ON THIS FOR ""HEART-GREATIST HITS"" ON SONY. ONLY 4 SONGS ARE THE ORIGINAL RECODINDGS FROM THAT PERIOD.THE OLDER MATERIAL IS MY PREFERENCE AND THIS LEAVES ME DISSAPOINTED. FOR OTHERS IT'S FINE."
4,pepers at their best,"I have to say that around the world is one of the best rhcp songs ever recorded.Flea at his very best on bass makes this a true peppers classic together with songs like ""Under the bridge"".I can't say much more other than it gives me so much joy as a rhcp fan to see they are still cooking up the good stuff after all these years!"
5,Cute rhymes and retro art work,"My kids love this book. Gerald is a kid who can only make noises (such as ""boing"" and ""bam"") much to the dissappointment of his parents. He has a hard time in school and the kids make fun, but in the end he lands a cool job doing sound effects for a radio show. It's an older Dr Suess book, written in the 1960's I think. Some parents don't care for it because they don't like how Gerald is made out to be shunned for being different. I think it's just a cute book that rhymes...and the sound effect button makes it interactive for the kids. It's a hit in our house."
1,Defective,"The book did arrive in a timely fashion however, it is a sound book and the sounds do not work. Very disappointed"
2,Way Out in West Virginia:Must Have,"This book was a dissapointment. I do not consider it a ""must have"". The other two WV books I ordered were much better and I recommend them in preference to this book.They are: West Virginia: An Explorer's Guide (Explorer's Guides) and Scenic Driving West Virginia."
3,The Grass Is Blue,I am only going to talk about one song on the album and that is 'The Grass Is Blue' sung by Norah Jones. Norah sings this song so well and has adapted Dolly's bluegrass song into her own. Right from the first note to the very end Norah keeps you spellbound. Well Done!! Worth buying just for that 1 song.
4,Great Tribute,"This is album is great, if one is expecting to hear Dolly Parton's versions only on a tribute album then maybe they should realize what they are buying. It is great to have some different musical interpretations of Dolly's songs. And all the people that criticized Sinead's cover should be slapped for such idiotic heresy."
1,Be good to Dolly,I couldn't believe what I heard - Dolly's song done in rap? Got the wrong people doing these wonderful songs. God knows I think Alison Krauss is great but she is horrible doing 9 to 5. Bad mismatch of artist to songs. Melissa Etheridge - keep doing your rock and leave Dolly along. I love Dolly doing country and bluegrass but these gals can't interpret her songs - don't buy this - it stinks!!
2,"Buy if you like the artists, not just a fan of Dolly's songs","Why would anyone slow down 9 to 5 - the whole point of this song as lost. I do, however, like Shania's version of Coat of Many Colours. Perhaps my disappointment stems from the fact that Dolly has always been country and each of these artists completely ignored the root of these songs. I'm all for doing things in a new and unusual way - as long as you are making an improvement. I felt that some of the songs were done in a new and different way just for the sake of saying it was different, not necessarily better. I guess I am just a Dolly fan afterall."
1,"I LOVE Dolly, but I could cry...its AWFUL!!!","Folks, save your money and buy instead one of the great Dolly Parton anthology albums out there where someone who can actually feel her music (Dolly herself) is singing it. This is a horrifying abuse of some of the best country songs ever written. The worst thing I ever heard is Shania Twain butchering Coat of Many Colors (I'm certain that if Joseph himself heard this he'd want to stay at the bottom of a well till it was over). Allison Krauss sounds great as usual but who's idea was it to SLOW down this classic song?The only good rendition on this album is Just Because I'm a Woman...oh wait, is that Dolly herself singing? No wonder...sheesh!"
3,No One Surpasses Dolly,"Sometimes it's refreshing to hear a new voice singing old, familiar material. And some songwriters' lyrics are better sung by someone else. Judy Collins, for example, often sings Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen songs much better than they do and makes the material her own. That is not the case here. No one sings Dolly better than Dolly. Although Whitney Houston made barrels of money on her version of I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, she cannot touch Dolly's heartfelt rendition of that song. And nobody on earth should sing COAT OF MANY COLORS but Ms. Parton The only singer who comes close to Dolly on this CD is Emmlou Harris singing TO DADDY. I have loved her version of that Parton classic for years.At her best, Dolly writes and sings beautiful music. You'll be better off buying a Dolly Parton Greatest Hits CD or, for that matter, the wonderful TRIO CD recorded several years ago by Dolly, Emmylou and Linda Ronstadt This CD is a real disappointment."
2,Save your money.,The main purpose of this album is to remind us how good Dolly Parton really is. Save your money to buy the originals.
4,A Great Tribute,I love this cd. I listen to it all the time. All the artist did a wonderful job with this collection. I especially love the Norah Jones song.
5,A real eye (& ear!) - opener!,"I eagerly awaited the release of this CD since first hearing of it a few months ago, having come to love Dolly's songs on Little Sparrow. This did not disappoint. To hear artists from such a variety of genres take these songs and make them their own is a real treat for the ears. Although Dolly's roots are in traditional country and bluegrass/mountain music ( and the women from those genres did great things here too), the fun is hearing artists from a more eclectic range, such as Melissa Etheridge, Sinead O'Connor, and Me'shell N'degeocello, add their interpretations as well. My favorite cuts are probably Mindy Smith's haunting ""Jolene"" which just begs you to sing along,and Joan Osborne's "" Do I Ever Cross Your Mind"". I think Dolly did wonderful things with these songs, but these women bring new and sometimes even better interpretations."
4,Excellect Reference Material,"This book seems to be the most in line with the current going rates and estimating practices. Recommended, excellect reference material."
3,Decent rope,"This is the rope that I use to tie a large tarp to the top of my trailer to stop the leaks. I have had the rope tying the tarp to my trailer for several months now, and it has held well, though it has stretched a bit over time. My rope came an a handy spool like device in an atrocious green and yellow color. If I was able to pick the color of the rope that I got, then I would have rated it a star higher.It is strong rope, though the ends do tend to fray over time if they are not tied in knots or burned into submission. it is strong rope, but I am sure that there is better for the cost; I am just not sure what rope is better.Great for camping, and there is minimal chafing when tied around the wrists or ankles!"
5,Camping Rope,"These worked for what I wanted them for. Soft, easy to cut, tied knots easily, and untied without any problems."
2,CD problems,"I'm not sure what happened or if it is just my cd, but the sound quality isn't even close to that of some of my oldest records...really sad too because the collection is great."
3,"Good book - a bit boring, though","I chose this book for an English project because it was in my teacher's recommended list. I liked the story's theme - suicide - but this was no page turner. I had to force myself to read because my English grade depended on it. However, the book did inspire a poem, which I included in the project. If you want to discuss this book or any other, e-mail me."
1,Face in the middle of this book!,"Face at the edge of the world is on of my favorite books. I actually shed some tears reading this novel! I read it for an assignment in high school one year, and I am so glad I did. This book erases the color lines sometimes drawn in society and it describes how one bad decision or judgment can ruin your life. I recommend this book to anyone who is involved in any kind of interracial relationship."
5,The Review,This book has excellent pictures with the most vital information for a biography project. A great buy and great read for interested fans of Ol' Blue Eyes.
5,The Chairman of The Board,I saw this book at a friends house on his coffee table and after flipping through the pages; I was sold. Frank has always been the centerpiece of the music in my house. This book is a fitting tribute to Old Blue Eyes...
4,Great Mysteries,"This is a fantastic video. Loved it!!!The acting is brilliant, and the video quality is superb."
1,Too big!,"This watch is massive and very clunky. I bought it for my husband, but we ended up returning it. The face is so thick, he could barely move his wrist! Just too big all around."
4,Good for the Price!,"Sure, the record company could have added more songs for the CD release, but with the price, you get some amazing songs. ""Look What You've Done to Me"" from the ""Urban Cowboy"" soundtrack is present, as are great late 70's hits like ""Miss Sun"" and ""Jojo,"" which both have grooves to die for. Of course, you couldn't have a greatest hits of Boz without some great ""Silk Degrees"" cuts, and you have the required ""Lowdown"" and ""Lido Shuffle"" as well as his greatest ballad, ""We're All Alone."" If you've heard a song by Boz on the radio that you like, this collection would be a good place to dip your foot in the Boz pool."
4,Great Album!,"Boz never fails to energize my days as well as color it....especially the song ""You Can have Me Anytime"".Listen to this album and be transported to Nirvana."
3,Only three stars because...,"I only gave this 3 stars for one reason... I haven't listened to the whole thing... It was purchased for one song, We're All Alone, for a particular reason which I won't get into. If you are into sap and you like Boz's voice at its most powerful then you gotta get it... Even if you don't and you have real audio listen to the sound clip of We're All Alone"
2,inaccurate size chart,"The product seemed to be of a good quality, which is why i gave it two stars, but the sizing online is completely inaccurate. I ordered a S/M after looking at the chart and when i opened up the package they were entirely too small. Only made it about halfway up my thighs =/... then when i checked the size chart on the back of the package the chart was completely different.. i would consider ordering a size up from what is online."
4,Ballet Tights,"I actually bought these tights way before I bought the same color Capezio leotard. They are stretchy and comfortable.I am 5'4"" and 130 pounds, and I got the L/XL, which for me are just right. I would purchase another pair if they camein navy or brown."
5,so soft!,"I love these tights! They are so soft, sturdy and breathable. I bought them in white, and I can't wait to get more colors. Definitely pay attention to the sizing chart, though. I didn't the first time and ended up have to order two sizes larger. They run kind of small."
2,Uncomfortable tights,"These tights are very tight in the waist. I order L/XL and I fall in the low end of that size range. They were plenty long, but so tight in the waist that they are really uncomfortable. The waistband is also scratchy instead of soft and comfy. I am used to other brands that are much more comfortable. I'm very disappointed in these! I would only recommend these for very small waisted people."
1,total mess up!,"How can sellers be sooooo foolish? The colors do not display correctly, size charts are messed! Is it SOOOO DIFFICULT to describe your product correctly?!!! If you don't know exactly about the sizes of your products, then just simply take a picture of the back side of its package and upload here!I'm just really angry with such kinds of sellers! Isn't it evident that it is so silly to sell products like this?Such messy things do not attract customers!I am now in a search for about 10 pairs of tights, but definitely not buying it here, though quality seems to be ok! I just don't want to be fooled about sizes and later spend my precious time for cancelling order, changing products, etc.."
4,Made things clear for a true beginner,"I bought this book because I had ZERO experience with excel, and was lost when my university sent out a tutorial that assumed some basic understanding. This book allows you to go from true Novice to competent excel-user. A good buy."
1,There is no CD with this book.,"This book is advertised here as coming with a CD. Mine did not. The envelope for the CD was empty. I see that another review was written to this effect several months ago, but neither the seller nor Amazon has chosen to rectify the situation."
1,excel personal trainer,this book was suppose to come with a training cd and i didnt receive it with the book.\
2,disappointing,"I was expecting this book to be a great tool to increase my skills using excel. Instead, I found it to have little help for me. I'm not particularly adept at excel and I think the book is geared toward the more experienced user."
4,An objective metric of your knowledge,"Do you see the amusing part on the book's cover? Not the cartoon chick with big breasts. The book's printing date is 2005, so the 2003 in the title is deprecated, as being slightly awkward. Hence, let us not ask where is Excel 2005?Aside from this, the book gives a tightly focused test of your Excel knowledge. Each chapter is divided into lessons. Each lesson has a concise explanation of a topic. Then, the chapters end with quizzes and answers. Arguably, it is these quizzes that yield the key value of the book, as they let you actually test your grasp of the subjects. The questions seem to vary from easy to moderate in difficulty. Despite what the back cover says about the book being able to tone up skills of beginners and experienced users, if the latter includes you, then the book may simply be too easy.Instead, the book may be of the most benefit to new users, who want an objective metric of their knowledge."
5,Backtrack Compatible,"I purchased this wifi adapter because of the great reviews here on Amazon. I was looking for a card that is compatible with backtrack if you guys know what I mean. For that purpose it works beautifully 100%. Backtrack recognizes it without installing any drivers; just plug and play.As for the range of this unit, it clearly improved reception by at least 100%. I only had 4 weak signals with my laptop built in card, but with the Alfa, I got more than 14 with most of the networks in EXCELLENT SHAPE. Could not be happier ;)For Windows 7 users: Go to the Alfa website to download the right driver and don't install the driver on the CD. This is the only way it would work with Win 7. This thing is definitely a keeper."
4,Good value for investment.....,"I have an office in my basement and the wifi antena was up stairs, this little device did the trick I have good connection about 95% of the time."
5,Bought this Alfa AWUS036H for a project I was doing in college,"The main reason I bought this was it would work right out of the box with Back Track. I am taking an Internet security class and this WiFi adapter did exactly, what instructors, Back Track forums, and other fellow students, said it would do. What is nice about it, with a little downloading and minor tweaking it started working right away. The only draw back to this adapter, it is only Wirless b/g."
3,Could not get it to work,This little thing was frustrating. I had such high hopes but could not ever get it to work. I'm running Windows 7 Professional. I installed the drivers that came with the CDs. There were two and I tried them both. I also tried the drivers on the Alfa website for Windows 7 and they didn't work. The thing would not pick up any sort of signal. Maybe I just had bad luck but I'm sending thing back to Amazon and going to go a different route.
5,Now I can Sling Wirelessly,"I like to watch tv with my Slingbox using a laptop inside my boat inside my outbuilding. I've been using an Engenius EUB362-EXT 200mw adapter but I was experiencing stuttering, dropouts, and freezing. At first I thought it was my wireless router. Then I tried it using a neighbors router that I was able to pick up. Same problems. Was it a Slingbox problem ??? Nope, works great over ethernet. I decided it must be my Engenius so I thought I'd try the Alfa. What a joy! Not only is the video flawless but I surf the net with multiple tabs, email, youtube, all simultaneously. This is with an Asus eee1000he. It works just great on my Dell too ! I only wish I'd found this sooner. I went through a lot of grief tweaking my router and my Slingbox before I finally fingered the Engenius as the culprit."
4,Good for the price,It does what it says! Got improved range and could pick up tons of other Wireless AP in the area that I could not see before. The big draw back for this unit is that only once in a while it will loose signal with the weaker access points. This is resolved by just resetting the wireless connection. Other then that it is a good unit.
4,500 mw usb adaptor w/rp-sma,"BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT, MY LAPTOP WIRELESS CONNECTION WAS NOT VERY GOOD. I WAS PICKING UP THE SERVICE THROUGH A SATELLITE SYSTEM LOCATED APPROX. 500 YARDS FROM MY HOME. THE ADAPTOR ALLOWED TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENTS ON CONNECTIVITY AND DOWNLOAD TIME. VERY PLEASED AND MONEY WELL SPENT BECAUSE MY NEXT STEP WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNING UP FOR A SERVICE."
4,Good Investment,"I recently moved to a new apartment and the pool with free wifi is about a block away. At first, I was disappointed because my signal was intermittent (inside the apartment), but when I tried using my laptop without the adaptor at the laundromat next door to the pool, I couldn't get any signal. From that point on, I realized I had made a good investment. Your signal probably won't be consistent, depending on the time of day and weather conditions, but it is better than having no wifi adaptor at all."
2,dissapointed,"Unless I was unable to install and properly configure the alpha 500 with the Vista drivers( which seemed difficult to load some how and when it did it did not allow me access to the program.)I am dissapointed. I was hoping to pick up a signal as i was told from up to 3 miles, I could not.perhaps I will try something else or try to find a web site with the vista drivers for this device."
1,not for Mac,"The wifi adapter was bought for use with a Mac laptop. The included software is for use with a pc, not a Mac. Called the maker for help and was told to download software for a similar adapter by another maker. Decided not to jump through hoops to make this adapter work and returned it."
1,500 mw Disappointment,"Up in the mountains at my sometimes retreat I get away from it all but I'd still like to have web access available. My nearest neighbor, a full time resident, kindly supplied me with the security key to his WIFI system, but the distance is just great enough that reliability is poor, using my laptop. I bought this device and Viola! I have wonderful signal strength, but no connectivity. No one has explained how this can happen, so I sent it back. Fortunately, Amazon is a great company, so returning it was no problem."
2,Can't keep it plugged in,"boy, if it not plugged in properly, then I cannot keep it pointed in the correct direction. i usually do not even use it anymore."
2,works kinda,has three quarter bars in my garage but says limited or no activity? why? anyone know how to fix it?
3,Doesnt work fast for N network,Okay i know this might be silly of me but i got this hoping that this may work well for N generation network. It doesn't. The speeds are much much reduced even though it can pick up strong signals.Lesson learnt- Strong signals doesn't mean fast speed!Stay away if you are using fibre optic network or any network that runs N network! (Hi-speed)
5,very good,This antenna is very powerful. I bought one for myself and was so satisfied that I bought one for a friend also.
1,Wireless Amplifier,It did not live up to the claimed performance. I would not recommend it for anything more than an in-house router.
2,mehhh!!,"I bought this to be able to use the wireless network of my friend on the first floor (Im on the fourth floor right up ). but the wifi adapter really didnt work.or even didnt make it a little better, although it's supposed to be good for long distances!another thing, I have a 10.6 mac but it seems the company havent updated the driver for mac 10.6. so I had a hard time to actually install the adaptor by changing the kext file myself!!"
2,Own 2 one is great,"I own 2 of these, both new, one is really good , the other is weak and only picks up about half as many wireless signals. Could not find a warranty return process on their web site."
1,Unacceptable!,"I purchased this item based on the recommendation of a friend and boy am I disappointed! I ordered this to use in conjunction with my Hp Net book while on a road trip for the past month. I assumed it would work and waited until I was a few days into the trip to ""setup"" the extender for use with Backtrack Linux via Virtual box within Windows 7 starter. To my surprise, it was DOA, nothing, nada, zip!!! No light, the computer didn't detect it, and yes all my usb ports work fine with other peripherals. I also tried my hosts computer at the time and no dice there either. In addition to that, I find out while on the road, that I am outside the return policy and out of pocket 27.99.... buyer beware!"
1,Bad Product,"I bought this antenna and I was mailed an incomplete package, and when I even complained about it, it was not rectified.no one even bordered to contact me about it, how could they do that. You can't treat your customers like that."
1,What a waste,"I really should have paid attention to the other reviewers who gave this a poor rating. But due to the other positive feedback ratings, I thought, ""Must be people who aren't very good with a computer."" I thought wrong. I must have spent two hours trying to load this thing up. The mini disk wasn't a problem, as some have stated. Maybe my laptop holds them better. But the actual loading of the software is a trial to be endured. I THINK I finally got it loaded, but my computer never seemed to recognize the unit, and it certainly didn't improve my reception, so obviously something was wrong. After struggling with it for two days, I gave it up as a bad job and returned the item for a refund. Maybe if I were a trained professional, I'd have had a bit more success. I don't know. I do know I've never had so much trouble trying to load anything on my computer. Very frustrating."
5,Alfa is simply amazing!,"So, it arrived and what more can i say.. ""wow"" this little beast looks and feels amazing, it performs even better!"
2,not as much reach as promoted,Advertising indicated this might reach as much as a mile. The signal I wanted to get is about 500 ft away but I can't pick up the signal. I did get a signal from Arby's which is further but I'd have to sit outside and down the road to use it. Will keep the antenna anyway in case I'm somewhere it might work
5,great product,"I had 2 bars and a weak signal from my router, this took it to 5 bars and an excellent signal,im running windows 7 i plugged it in and that was it!!!before i could open the cd it was up and running!!,i never needed the installation cd.All i had to do is change it to my default connection! If you have a weak signal in a remote part of your house this is what you need!!!!!!!"
1,Basically just a external NIC,"This product is mediocre at best. It helps to maintain a connection with a weak network signal but definitely does not help to pull in far away network or anything. The antenna is like 3 inches and the whole thing is powered by USB, real war driving hardware has external power and better gain antenna's. Not worth the money or time installing it."
1,Good Signal but dies after 5 months,"Pros:Strong signal.Easy to setup.Connects when other adapters could not.Cons:Often would only connect as 802.11b.Signal often would pick up at about 80% and then drop to 20% - suspect interference. AP was about 80 ft away through brick wall.Died after 5 months. Just stopped working and LED blinks some error code. 5 blinks, then 6 blinks. Would expect to last longer for the price"
2,false advertise,White they claim this thing could pick up the signal from 1-2 miles range. It only pick up signal around 70 feet.IT WILL NOT do anything beside boost the signal from 1-2 bars -> 4-5 barsIt will not pick up any signal that your laptop would not.So only buy it if your laptop can pick up a signal and you want to boost it.I take this thing to 11 TH FLOOR and direct it to my campus which is 1000 feet (0.2 miles) away and I cannot pick up the signal.THINK ABOUT IT.This will only pick up the signal not the signal tether. So It can only pick up as long as the Wifi router send the signal to it. So if the wifi router can only send the signal as far as 100 feet then even with the 1000$ wifi adapter you cannot pick up the signal if you are 101 feet away.
4,Alfa Wireless Amp,"This amp is helpful when my signal is weak. It fulfills my needs entirely. It is not to be used for distance sources, however."
3,"Outdated, but fine if this is what you need...","Keep in mind, this will NOT work with the wireless n protocol (or anything newer). Had some trouble until I went to the Alfa website and downloaded a new driver. After that, it worked fine. Boosted the signal from a distant router from one bar to five. The Alfa site is a pain to navigate and it was not particularly clear which driver I needed although once I found it the install was easy. But if things like that confound you, get something else."
2,performance is not there,"Device came without instructions or user manual. After spending time on the web researching for literature and driver for MAC OS, I able to install successfully however the performance of the device is not there. Total waste of money."
4,Good product but bad software -- solution in review!,"I get poor signal in my room from the router downstairs, so I bought this product hoping that it would work well on Windows 7.After installing the driver via a USB drive (I don't have a CD-Rom drive) I found that it did, but with an annoying bug -- the wireless utility program and the windows networking utility didn't play nice. Every time I booted up the computer, I had to reset my connection to 'shared' WEP instead of 'open' WEP and retype my password. A quick google search revealed that I was not the only one who had serious driver issues with this product.Ultimately, I found a video on youtube -- ""ALFA Driver Installation Guide for Windows7""This video walks you through installing the driver without installing the Alfa Wireless Utility, and successfully solved my problem. The product works well, but I can't give a high rating in good faith when the product required such a nonintuitive fix."
5,Does what is says it does!,I was skeptical but it works great. I went from 1 bar to 4 bars instantly and of course got a clearer faster signal. My version didn't come with the short 2.5 dbi antenna but rather with a separate bigger 5 dbi antenna. Who's complaining? I saw on Ebay a 15 dbi addon antenna with which I expect even further range possibilities for only $10.
1,Don't waste your time...,"This little piece of garbage isn't worth the effort. Save yourself some time, especially if you have a Mac with an operating system newer than Snow Leopard. It was such a pain just to get it to work then it didn't even provide any range extension."
1,Died after 4 months and no warranty or service options,I bought this usb wireless adapter and it fired up and worked fine for 4 months. One day I just started to notice the drop from 16 mb to 3 mbs throughput. Rebooted and usually a reset of the usb connection worked (which was annoying) as well. No luck...decided it was time to call their support line. A taiwan a long distance number...really??? and no online support.Very disapointed should have confirmed the warranty before buying...there isn't one.
5,Excellent booster,"I have a large home about 5000 sq. ft. I have my desktop with a new Belkin N router and on the other side of my home we have a home office. Our netbook was getting a ""very low"" signal. Everything I researched was so expensive. I even called Cablevision to get a second Modem and they wanted $50 a month. A repeater would cost a few hundred dollars. In this economy I dont have alot of money to spend on this. I hooked this up and it immediately installed. I did not have to use the enclosed hardware ,luckily, as there is none in a netbook. My signal went from ""very low"" to ""Excellent"" within minutes. I have windows vista and XP and it worked on both. This was so affordable for $30.00. Give it a try as you have nothing to lose. I am glad I did."
1,Not the same outcome as everyone else...,"I purchased this WiFi signal booster before Christmas, and shortly after New Years and for no apparent reason, it stopped working. I had such high hopes for it and the reviews were great, but it is not worth the trouble purchasing if it only lasts approximately 2 weeks. I'd recommend something else!"
3,"It works well, but, it messes up Windows XP","It works to pull in weak wifi signals from a friend's router. However, I would like to have known that it was not certified to be compatible with Windows XP and causes some problems with log-on procedures. I wonder if there are other wireless adapter/extender devices which would have served the purpose equally well without compromising the functionality of Windows XP."
2,LAN Wireless Adapter,The product worked fine for two weeks and then failed. Could not re-install it. The company was very responsive and allowed me to return at their cost to ship me another one. I could not get that one to work at all. They (Dbroth) gladly are in the process of refunding my money.I should say that when the device worked it performed beautifully.
5,This antenna works,"I am very pleased with the Alfa AWUS036H. It does NOT uninstall my other wireless programs as one reviewer said, so I have both my internal wireless and this external one to switch to if I need to find a more distant source for internet access. I am amazed at how many wireless sites it will pick up. I can park almost anywhere in the city and find at least one network to access. This was money well spent."
1,Windows 8,"I rated this with 1 star, because I had to rate it, but its not really a fair rating as I was not able to use it. I just received my AWUS036H today. It is not compatible with Windows 8. I called the company and they told me that AWUS036NH will work with Windows 8. I looked at the specs for that model and it does not list Windows 8. So be careful if you are buying this product for that Windows."
5,In my opion its the best on the market,"Its a great device. I can pick up signal at a very good strenth; whereas, it used to be poor with my in the computer hardware. Anyone needing a stronger device - buy it."
5,Powerful!!!,"In the past I have tried two different wifi adaptors in my residence to obtain a wifi connection to no avail. I was ready to give up with continued useless attempts but decided to give this ""Alfa"" a final try. To my shock and amazement I received an immediate Internet connect. I consider this unit to be the ultimate in a wifi connect and I would highly recommend it. In fact this note is being transmitted through a wifi connection which was a total impossibility in the past."
4,Alfa Wi Fi USB adapter...good stuff!,"Have been using it for a few weeks now and I feel it was a great decision to purchase this device. The software is ""just OK"", but does the job. You won't be unhappy with this gear!By the way the Amazon dealer handling this was great! Super backup with my dumbass questions."
1,Not for Win 7,Does not work on Win 7. my old one from media link works but it is not very powerful ....guess i'll stick with that...... alfa is a piece of junk.Update:found something on Amazon that works well with Win 7....its called TP-LINK model 722N. It boosted my signal 3X
4,Good product,Works as promised. Detected almost twice as many wifi connections as compared to using the built-in wifi adapter of my laptop.
1,Good signal - very poor drivers,"I've had this for nearly a year. Great signal, especially with the 9dB antenna - no doubt about that part.However...The drivers are awful! Several times I've needed to download them, I can't reach their site to download! But that aside, the stability and quality is terrible. With absolutely great signal, my data connection keeps dropping and becomes unusable. I've tried it on several desktop PC's. I can sit here with my laptop and it's built-in wifi right next to me, which works great, meanwhile just trying to ping the router over this Alfa wifi device results in 70% packet-loss.I've tried really hard to like this...but I could never recommend it to anyone. I'd rather pay more for something that works reliably."
2,Stopped functioning after two months,"Edit: after two months of use the antenna suddenly stopped functioning. I've replaced it with the TP-Link TL-WN722N.My landlord lets me use his wireless internet. However, he recently switched providers and, in doing so, relocated his wireless router to a part of his house that is farthest from me. After the relocation I was getting 0-1 bars of signal. But with this antenna, I'm consistently getting 4-5 bars. Given the price of this product, I'm very pleased."
3,Hide & Seek,"After hours of seeking answers regarding the issues involved with the installation / setup of this product, I figured the answer(s) were either not out there or they were hiding where I couldn't find them.I have an Acer Aspire One netbook with Windows 7 32-bit OS. The ALFA user manual driver cd was USELESS. Websites that offered solutions (including 'better' driver download options), were also useless in my situation.So! I uninstalled everything having to do with this product one last time & decided to let my curiosity do what it does best: find my own way . . . And it worked.I plugged in the hardware 1st & let it do its thing. Then I went to Device drivers, found the new hardware & clicked the Update driver option. Windows found the driver, downloaded it & installed it. Viola! It works. My signal went from 1-2 bars to 4 bars.I hope this helps others."
3,OK does job,I am overall pleased with the product but it is not without faults. I don't like the AWOL support for the product. When it CRASHES IT CRASHES you have to get VERY creative to get it to work again. Once it is working though it works like a champ! So 3 stars.
1,HORRIBLE,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! if you want you may as well flush your money down the toilet. The router i have been trying to connect to is no more than 200feet away and the built in wifi card on the laptop is a million times better than this even with the ""upgraded"" antenna. It worked for about a day or two and then wouldnt connect no matter what, it may work for about 30seconds before it would disconnect. I couldnt ever get it up to full speed unless i was right beside the router, and honestly what good is that?"
2,Same a Proton GSky? but $100 over priced?,This appears to be the same as the Blue Proton GSky unit which is only $28. The GSky works great.
3,NOT BAD,is not that badwifi are stronger than usualsignal strengh are more effectivebut in returnit also dangerous to kids...i mean the RF wave...
4,Good when it works,"Gain is awesome... but it started just dropping out, I'd have to unplug/replug the usb to get it running again... now it only works 1 day a week.***Update*** Weirdest thing... my computer seems to have dedicated USB ports for networking, ounce I plunged this into that it works like a champ... well sort of seems to have some sort of weird relationship with my Netgear adapter and refuses to work unless they are both plugged in together.But I'm (4/5 stars) happier with it than I was before."
1,Not compatible with Windows 7 64 bit,"This card works excellent on Linux. However, it is not compatible with Windows 7 64-bit. After several hours of trying to get it working (updated drivers from manufacturers site, manually installing drivers, etc.) I finally gave up. If you're running Windows 7 64 bit, do not purchase this item. The online support from the manufacturer is non-existent and their documentation is lacking at best. Fortunately I run a dual operating system of Windows 7 and Linux, so at least I can use it when I'm in Linux. If you're not technically savvy, this is not the product for you."
2,For me not the answer to grabbing those week signals when on the road...not even close!,I tried this and even used two different antenna but no luck. Just not what I expected at all. Hope this helps future consumer. Have a blessed day!Rev Patrick Muston
1,wrong cd,I would have liked to know that the cd they were sending could not be used on my apple laptop. it was too small of a diameter .I inserted it into my laptop and had to go to an apple store to get it removed.I mailed it back but have not been reimbursed yet .I Do not know if the cd was compatible with apple.Never got the chance to find out . But I bet it was not .
3,ok not great... not what i expected,Well recently bought this item from amazon and it got here on time and it worked but the problem that i seen was that it didnt work to well at all.... better than the laptop wifi but not better than a zonet wifi stick that i bought off another site.... (ZEW 2546) and well this one has no antenna or nothing its a small thumb sized usb stick and well i was really thinkning that the alfa product would be alot better but it was not... it was actually more expensive and didnt preform to expectation.... its decent but not great when i actually need it cause im out here in afghanistan but i did also purchase the (nrh) one that is supposed to be better with the 9 dbi antenna i really hope it does better.....
2,Alfa AWUS036H Upgraded to 1000mW 1W 802.11b/g High Gain USB Wireless Long-Rang WiFi network Adapter with 5dBi Antenna - for Ward,"The Alfa AWUS036H worked great when I used Windows XP, but my new PC came with Windows 7 and I have had nothing but problems with the driver software.Sometimes it works and sometimes it won't work without re-installing the drivers. What a pain in the butt this has become. I like other people have downloaded what is suppose to be new drivers but I see no difference in performance."
2,software & service issues,This network adapter/ antenna definately improves reception of wi-fi signals. All previous signals identified on my laptop improved significantly. The unit has software issues and only worked properly intermittantly. There's no telephone service support so I went through numerous emails back and forth. Determined that the unit was authentic but no reset or correction was available. If Alfa could work out it's software issues this would have been a nice improvement for my reception.
5,ALFA wifi net adapters,I have bought 4 of these and they all meet the spec's as mention. and with gain antennas its been great .MY pc hold tight on a signal and never drops. and I can switch to another local wifi service in the area when one drops off its too easy and great product .im here tonite to order a couple more. I put the RF tester on them and the freq counter and there performing as advertised. thank you so much on these.
3,Perhaps it's my misunderstanding....,"I wanted a product that boosted my signal throughout my house, enabling me to use my ipad in my bedroom, however this connects to my laptop, when it goes to sleep, it does too....too bad for me!"
2,Horrible reliability and service,"This thing is great...if you're lucky and can get it to work. It boosted our signal to the wifi (located far away) but there are so many problems that we've had and zero customer service that was useful. The throughput will often stop giving us feedback (data) and the entire thing won't work even though we can connect to the wifi for a moment (at one bar without the adapter) before the signal goes away). It will work, but we never know when it's going to stop working for days on end before suddenly it'll start working again.Very unreliable and hard to fix. I'd rather pay more for something that we could use without wondering when it'll stop working next."
3,Great but limited drivers,"Works great, range is pretty good. The only complaint I have is the drivers suck and its hard to get it working with some systems."
3,Had a problem loading the drivers,"If I weren't a computer person, I probably wouldn't have been able to load the drivers.I loaded the drivers for Windows 7 from the disk first, then plugged in the device - didn't work. To make a long story short, I uninstalled the drivers, plugged in the device & pointed to the appropriate drivers on the disk.Once the drivers were loaded, it worked great."
3,It has vista 64 bit issues,"I have been trying to get a stronger wifi signal from the hospital I work for. I work in a small building across the parking lot from the main building. I would say I am less than two city blocks from the main hospital with no major obstructions in between the two buildings. With a standard USB antenna I have been able to pick up a weak signal, but it wasn't much better than being on dial up. This new adapter will give me four out of five bars, but doesn't seem to want to connect to the open network router. The website provides no answers for this. Windows update provided an updated driver for the device, but it still will not connect for me. My D-link adapter has no visible bars, but still allows me to browse the net albeit very slowly. I am still looking for answers on this one."
3,Nice,"My daughter lives about 150' away and was only getting one ""bar"" from our wireless router. This device boosted her received signal up to 4 out of 5 bars. She can now watch streaming video and upload largish documents with no slowdowns. Easy to install and use.Update: I liked my daughters so much that I bought one for myself. Unfortunately this one was awful! There was no installation CD and the package wasn't sealed. The package said it was a model NH but the sticker on the bottom of the device indicated it was a model H. Trying to download drivers from the site is like pulling teeth. There is a third party downloader that makes you wait up to 90 seconds for the download link and offers to reduce the wait for $$."
1,Did not work for me,I really tried to get this to work but I could not. On a new Compaq laptop with Vista32 it would drop off the USB bus constantly & sometimes would reappear & sometimes not. Maybe got a bad hardware unit I don't know.
5,Many giggles included,"Funny, silly in places, but a fun series for all ages. There is humor at many levels. Short series. Squid girl is definitely one of a kind, thank goodness for that!"
4,Well Chosen Basie,"Someone did an excellent job of choosing the tracks on this collection. The time period is narrow, 1936-1941, but this is when Basie did some of his best stuff, principally because of Lester Young's presence. I believe the first two (of four) disks are the best, particularly the Kansas City Seven sides from 1939. The sound is great and the price is right."
3,Not as amped up as other material,"This album seemed to lack the strong and vibrant energy I've heard from their other albums. While there are a few tracks that come off strong, overall the album itself is not something worth remembering."
3,Hardcore Skillet fan let down,Not their usual stuff. Don't know how else to describe it. Better examples of their work is in Collide and Comatose. Get those instead (both 5 stars)
1,No Good!,"I am really disappointed with this album. Skillet is a very talented band, but this album is ridiculous. C'mon, we don't want a bunch of techno sci-fi music. What happened to the Skillet of 1996? That wasn't that long ago??? Was it?? What happened to the great bass riffs-John Cooper is one of the most gifter bass players on earth! This album is a waste of talent for him. It is sad to see the direction of this band. There is hope though with Ardent Worship. Ardent Worship is a masterpiece!"
5,"awesome, awesome, awesome","Skillet is the best! Buy their cd's, you won't be dissapointed ever. Seeing them perform live is even better. They are a Christian band, so they have some slow songs, but most of them rock. It's nice to hear good clean lyrics with the hard rock sound. Thanks skillet!"
5,This is a great CD,"Skillet is quite a band. I discovered these guys when they performed live on a church retreat I was on. They are awesome. ""angels Fall Down"" and ""Rest"" are two great slower spritual songs to go with the blend of hard techno/rock songs that comprise the rest of the cd. It is a great CD."
4,Christian Industrial?,"Well, I'm not a christian, nor do I attend church on even a semi-regular basis. However, there's no doubting that this album ROCKS! I was given a copy of this disc by a friend & really had no clue they were a christian band. After reading the lyrics, I figured it out, but the music itself is what really makes this band shine. Great arrangements, heavy guitars, unique loops & keyboards...it's all here & worth a serious listen. Trust me, if you are open-minded & have a thirst for crunching techno-alternative rock...you will LOVE this disc! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,Not a bad album,"Not a bad album but I like their newer stuff better. I like ""Awake"" quite a bit better than this one. I believe this was Skillets first album."
5,Skillet is Invincible!,"One of the few bands who get even BETTER with every new release. They are definately at the top of their game with the release of Invincible. The music varies from the intense White Zombie-esque ""Powerful"" to the slower ""I Rest"" and ""You're the One"" that compare to last album's ""More Faithful."" There's also a song at the end called ""Angels Fall Down"" that is beyond comparison. The song actually made me cry. The album ""Invincible"" blends incredible music with the uncomprimising lyrics that define the band. I give this album 6 out of 5 stars and will be listening to it for the next month straight. If you want an Incredible CD, get Invincible."
5,Oooops I overlooked this album on my last review!,"The more I played this disk, the more it grew on me. I am really impressed with it. I guess I just wasn't used to it at first. I highly recommend this cd. Skillet is a great all around christian band with a great mission to impact the youth. If you buy this album, it may take you some time to get used to it. But it is loaded with talent. Just a great all around cd. With great musical talents. Each of the songs are unique and sound great. And the message for Christ is AWESOME!"
5,Awesome,Veery addictive good for those long waits in very boring places (doctors offices and car trips) needs online capability
3,Not Unique,"Bomberman is interesting to me. I have played different kinds of Bomberman games on different consoles. This one is so-so. The story is very poor. An alien comes to Bomberman's world and changes what the world is like. Then Bomberman tries to take back those lost areas. There are 10 areas each of which includes 10 stages. Some of the bosses are the same, just have different colors. The environment in each area is pretty simple. Nearly the same. I can not stand this. Kind of boring. Maybe rocks turn into metal or something else. That's all. Your mission? Beat all the enemies and then be tranported to the next stage. All the same. Something I like is choose items from the touch screen with the stylus. It is pretty cool. We can store those items. If we need some, just touch the picture of the item. I beat this game in 2 hours or 3. Wow, so soon. Probably it is better for you to rent it, not to buy it."
5,Very Entertaining,I missed this when it was in theaters and even still it was worth the wait. A very well told story with a moral.
5,Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Gr'Hoole,I received this movie as a gift for Christmas and just like it so much. The Owls are so wise and brave.
5,Great movie,This is a feel good movie for viewers of all ages...you can feel it all the way down to your gizzard. I definitely recommend this movie!
4,Gizzard = Force,"Is it me or does this movie feel like Star Wars except with owls? I could help but think of Obi Wan saying to Luke, ""Use the gizzard Luke... Use the gizzard!"" Oh well... Still liked the movie. Kids liked it too (ages 10 and 12). My 6 year old thought that the owl fighting scenes were a little scary. The 3D effects were good. For 15 bucks, definitely worth it!"
3,like owls,"It was a little hard to follow, but we bought it for the grandchildren and I'm sure they will have no trouble following it."
3,Good for older kids and adults,"Good movie. BUT, I rented it to watch with my grandkids, 5 and 8. It was too scary and they couldn't follow some of the story. They watched part of it. We turned it off when the 5 yr. old said, ""This might make me have nightmares."""
5,great plot,dvdtalk.com's recommendation on this movie is collector's series addition.you just gotta get over the fact that they're owls. but it plays into the premise and plot.
4,nice for the hole family,a very special movie nice for the hole family to watch from the studuio that brought happy feet and director of watchmen and 300 you got to check it out it is the first animation made with this nice style which is a great style a 2 disk set blu ray of the movie and DVD with a slip cover but yet if this will be your first animation then check out toy story 3 and despicable me before
4,"Stunning looking film, filled with great 3d.","If you are looking for a good 3D movie for the kids this is your movie. It is in the top 5 best looking 3d movies along with Rio, Open Season, Puss anf boots, and Tangled."
3,Legend of the Guardians,The animation and 3D effects were outstanding. The detail on the animation was stunning--you could see the fuzz on the feathers of the owls. The story was a repetition of many that have gone before. This time it featured owls.
4,Better then I thought,"Great 3d. Feels like it wants to be an epic then remembers its a kids movie bout mid way. Good, fun very good cg, top notch transfer."
5,Beautiful 3D and great story line,"This is one of our favorite examples of 3D animation we've seen so far. The details, include feather strands within feathers. Highly recommended."
3,Amazing visuals,"This is one of the better looking 3D blu rays, but the story just wasn't very captivating. It didn't hold my 4 year old's attention past the first 15 minutes and I had to fight to stay awake later on to finish it. I enjoyed the extras that I did watch. I'm sure that if I had read the source material I would appreciate the movie more, but as it stands it's just an okay movie that's only worth watching for the gorgeous visuals."
4,Legends of the Guardians,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but my son absolutely loved it! He was 5 when he first saw it and he loved it so much I bought for his birthday. He really enjoyed the extras, learning about owls. He even surprised me at the zoo when he rattled off a few owl facts!"
3,Disappointing if you'ver read the books.,"I've read the first three books with my 7 1/2 year old son. He and I have really enjoyed the stories--page turners for us both. But, we had very different reactions to the movie: He loved the movie so much that he wanted to watch it again when it was over; I on the other hand found the adaptation VERY disappointing. I thought the books are rich and multi-layered. The movie was thin and confusing. If you haven't read the books, I think the movie would be very hard to follow. My son gave it 5 stars and I gave it one star, so I split the difference and gave it three stars."
5,Outstanding Movie,This movie was so good that i got lost in it right away. The Animation on this movie was excellent i really thought those were real owls. They did an awesome job on makeing the characters look real. This is an awesome movie and i can't wait to see part 2.
4,Great Family Movie,"My daughter and I really enjoyed this movie. I, myself was thoroughly stunned by the visuals of the owls, especially in the feathers. The story is good, the visuals are amazing and overall this is a great movie."
4,Missing Case,"Quality was great but it was missing case.Shipment was great and timely.If you put case picture , it should have it."
5,3D BluRay,Was an excellent movie and the 3D version that I ordered was excelkent quality with my Sony 3D BluRay player. Would highly recommend this movie to everyone!!!
4,Story good animation very good,love this film - love the animation and the story. children enjoy watching it; they love to read the books
2,Didn't stick to the books,"The movie doesn't stick to the books! It muddles two very important story lines, and doesn't leave room to fix it."
3,movie,Too long to sit and watch fell sleep. hard to keep track as to who is who they all look the same owls.
3,The movie was great...,"But the dvd itself was flawed. It only worked in my computer's cd drive and not in the dvd drive or player in the living room, which made it hard to watch with family."
3,"Weak story, visually controversial","Frankly, I expected much more from this movie based on so many positive reviews. I think I am missing the good animated stories (which do not have to be on Blu-Ray or in 3D). The story is what counts by far the most. This story was so-so, not too original or inspiring. I also felt that many details that Blu-Ray affords caused some visual discomfort. The only thing I would applaud is the great landscapes... For the sake of justice, my daughter liked this movie (but did not watch it again)."
3,It's OK,"Judging from the other reviews I guess I'm in the minority here. I thought the movie was just so-so and have enjoyed others like Despicable Me and Monsters vs. Aliens far more than I did this one. I didn't think the 3D effects were anything special. I bought it because I wanted to add to my collection of 3D content, but I probably won't watch this again."
2,"Attractive cinematography, weak story,bland plot. Appears to be made just to sell another 3-d disc.","Not recommended, probably not suitable as a kid stopper. Nice pictures, terribly lame plot,story,whatever. Sorry we wasted the money. We were not entertained."
2,legend of the guardian:the owls of ga'hoole,I was very disappointed. I read all 15 books. The movie has distorted the characters and plot. I would have prefered a closer interpretation of story and personalities. The animation was good and if you have not read the books I suppose most audiances would enjoy the movie. (I agree that the age group should be 9 and over.
5,Wonderful family film!,"It has been a long time since an animated movie really moved me, but this surely did. Great message of good over evil, and characters that you can not help but love."
3,Visually and audibly stunning...story wise? Nahhhh.,"I'm sure the book is fantastic, but this 1 1/2 hour movie tries to cover too much in too short of a period of time. There's no character development, the timeline is obscure, and the story just...isn't. The graphics are utterly amazing and worth the price of admission. Couple that with a killer surround sound, and it's worth the watch...once."
4,stunning !,i didn't expect much for this movie. rented on blu ray and now i own it. this movie has a predictable story but what zack snyder film isn't ? we enjoy his movie because of the visuals and how well crafted his movies are. this movie is amazing to look at. Just think 300 but with owls and less blood...
5,Great Graphics!,"This was a great buy for a great price.The graphics were awesome,the owls were so life like.The whole family enjoyed it.My son at 7 was glued to the TV.If you are an animal lover like us, you will like this movie."
3,"A review from a kid who read the whole set of the books, twice","I didn't watch the movie. I rent the movie for my 6 grade kid who read the books twice. Here is her review;It was a wonderful work of animation, but the story is horrible. I can think of around 5 differences from the books at a time. There are personality defects, I think some of the owls look weird, and most of the story is cut out. If you have watched a bit, there is no enchidna in the story either, (though 'the doubter' part was funny.) Also, some of the diologe sonds a little corny (out loud). Bacicly, they cut out too much from the books and added worse stuff, or nothing, in place of it. I wish they had sticked more to the books."
3,EMPTY NEST,"I prefer animated movies that make me laugh and don't require a scorecard to keep up with the characters' names.LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS is beautifully done--the owls are humanized well and the voice actors do good work.But I found myself bored and grew tired of the battles. It's also way too predictable and nothing made me laugh. The addition of teen-oriented pop doesn't add anything to the film.It's also kind of violent for younger kids who are obviously its target audience. The escape of Nyra the queen of the Pure Owls sets up a sequel, but I hope they let that idea go."
3,Ok,"Disappointing after reading the books. But it was a ok movie. The reason I gave three stars was because kludd wasnt kidnapped, kludd was the reason soren was kidnapped, the owls at st. angies wasnt the pure ones, kludd was the original leader of the pure ones. In the movie it is all messrd up."
3,while no where near as good as the books its a fine tale.,"My son enjoyed these books and wanted to see the movie, so it was rented but according to him (so not a personal review) the movie was very different from the books, but that is understandable knowing there are 3 books and 1 movie trying to cram it all in."
3,What Should I Say?,"Although this movie was visualing appealing, I just couldn't get into it. My nine-year-old grandson liked it OK but it's not a favorite. Wish I could have liked the movie more. I had high hopes but the plot seemed to drag. Nothing really wrong with the movie, I just didn't enjoy it."
4,Excellentes images mais pas de piste audio francaise sur le DVD,"Le BluRay a une qualite d'image et de son incroyable, seul probleme avec le DVD IL N'Y A PAS DE PISTE AUDIO FRANCAISE"
5,Great Movie!!!,My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It's a great movie for the grand kids or the kid in all of us. I think it delivers a message.
2,Gorgeous but vapid,"The visuals are gorgeous, I agree. But the dialog and plot are so sappy and cliche that it's extremely difficult for anyone over the age of ten to watch. Take every plot device from any archetypal fantasy film, throw them together, and that's the plot for this movie.My seven and nine year olds did enjoy it but it was sheer torture for me to sit through it. Buy it for your kids if you must but make them watch it when you're not around. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because my kids did enjoy it. But, tellingly, they didn't ask for it on blu-ray."
3,Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'hoole,"There is trouble in the forest and a odd group of owls must save the day. Based on a popular book series, this animated movie follows the adventure of a young owl that befriends a diverse group of owls while searching for the guardians to warn them of a plan to takeover Ga'hoole. Excellent animation and interesting story make this worth seeing. Probably to scary for younger children since there are frightening scenes of fighting and killing.CA Luster"
3,Decent,"The film was alright. The names of the owls were kind of confusing. The film was a little boring at the beginning, but it got better towards the end. A straightforward, not too complicated, decent adventure. I enjoyed learning about the storyline."
4,Owls,Was a little scary but the story is lovely. It is done in lovely animation and has a nice theme.
2,you've already seen 'this' movie 1000 times,"same hackneyed story about the progression of an underdog to a hero. the 3D is pretty well done but the soundtrack is generally awful. overall tone is pretty serious, but a couple attempts at comic levity are thrown in and fall flat. if you like owls and Zack Snyder, stick with the Watchmen."
1,Not for young children!,"I can't believe this film is rated PG. It is way too dark, serious and scary for young kids. We have PG13s that are more appropriate. I'm sure this movie is ""visually stunning,"" but it doesn't make up for dark plot as owls are kidnapped and forced into slavery in the name of what I would describe as a cult."
1,Digital Copy Code Already used?!?!,"Product review is for the LEGENDS OF GUARDIANS the Owls of Ga'Hoole (Blue-Ray 3D + Blue-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy)Not in the least bit happy about this. The main reason I bought this movie was to have a digital copy. Then I tried to input it in iTunes and iTunes tells me that the code has already been used. And I can't return it now that it's ""OPENED"". I hope the other 3 DVD combo packs I bought are not the same way other wise I will never buy another movie from Amazon. If I could give this a 0 star review I would!"
1,No Digital Copy,"While this item originally had a digital copy, it is now expired and can't be used. This product is being sold under false information."
5,Awesome movie!!!,"Looks spectacular on my 135"" screen in 3D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The movie, story, direction, acting is all great. Enough said, watch it already."
4,owls,"This is a very cute movie, mainly for kids. I did like it and recommend it if you have children."
3,I guess I liked it,"Well, this book, it.. i just odint really like the diary thing,it's okay, but i didn't finish reading it, because i read the booksthat its based on, and basically i was reading the same thing twice. the same thing with stevie, but hers was funny, i really liked it because it was so funny. since thats stevies character. but, my favorite books are the super editions and the Pine Hollows. those are really reall ood books. thats why i rate it 3 stars. it didn't seem as interesting as it did in the other books that you wrote. do you get what im saying??PS- the last book in the saddle club series, is show jumper, number 88"
3,"OKAY, but a LITTLE LOOOONG!","This book was alright, but compared to the one about Stevie, it STUNK. I thought this book drug on and on and on! The story line was also a little weak."
5,I loved Lisa:the Inside Story,"I like this book.I liked the part when Lisa was in Europe the most.It's kind of weird because the horse on the front of this book looks EXACTLY like a horse that's at the barn where I ride,and the horse on the front of Stevie:The Inside Story looks EXACTLY like a another horse that's at the barn where I ride.I thought that was pretty cool.P.S.If you're one of the people that doesn't like this book,then PLEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAASE do a review because I like to read the negative reviews because some of them are really funny.Thanks."
5,The Best Book Ever!,"I just loved Lisa: The Inside Story. I didn't really like thescreen play. I liked there trip out west with Kate Devine. I reallyliked the idea of keeping a dairy. I might even start one. I think it is one of Bonnie Bryants best books. But the book i really like is Rocking Horse. I am really like Lisa from looks, Srevie from Persanalotie, and Carole for her love of horses. This book is a must read. END"
2,What a sappy character! The whole book was that way...,"OK I love the Saddle Club series and several other books by Bonnie Bryant, but this book sucked. This book(LISA: THE INSIDE STORY) was just a repeat of other books. I mean, at least Stevie's inside story was funny! This was just plain boring. Lisa's such a sappy perfectionist. Ugh! She used to be my favorite character but she's not anymore--too unreal. I think Bonnie Bryant desperately needs to fix Lisa more--Ms. Atwood used to be good, but in this book she was way too ridiculous--and take #67 & 68, for instance. Because of her need to be totally, 100% PERFECT, the usually smart, logical Lisa becomes incredibly stupid. HELLO!? PLEASE, Bonnie, fix her. Don't make her TOO much of a perfectionist. It gets incredibly annoying."
4,Rey de las Naciones,"Es un gran clásico ya que se usó para: "" MARCHA PARA JESUS"" un evento mundial, es un album hermoso en que las canciones exaltan y declaran que Jesús es la Luz del Mundo."
5,Love these chilies!,"Chi-Chi's has jumped in to the selling on Amazon pool. Trusted name, tasty chilies for all your favorite recipes, and a GREAT price here on Amazon. These chilies are warm, not super hot, and add a nice subtle flavor to soups, stews, and tons of Mexican dishes. These are not in all stores, so very nice find here and super great price with free Amazon Prime shipping. Grab yours today!"
5,None better,If you want to aadd zip and flavor to any dish add these. Always just hot enough and the best tasting. This is the most dependable brand that I have ever used.
3,"When it's good, this hay is the best...","but lately we've gotten a number of batches that seem a bit off. One was very dusty and smelled off, a few seem like they've not been cured long enough. Oxbow is very good about offering a solution of some sort, be it sending money or product back, but quality here seems to have slipped a bit over the past two years.Pet Food Direct is wonderful, however! Always excellent communication and delivery is always well in advance of what they anticipate."
5,My guinea pigs love this hay!,"I have tried other brands, but my guinea pigs love Oxbow the best. It's much fresher than the brands you find in pet stores. My cavies eat this stuff like crazy and will hardly touch the other ones I've tried. Also, the 9 lb. size is much cheaper than buying the smaller bales at Walmart, and it lasts for months. All you need is one of the large air-tight storage containers to keep it in. I got mine at Lowe's for 10 dollars and it holds exactly nine pounds of hay."
4,"solid scifi, but this is excessively expensive for all but collectors","This is good hard scifi, told as an adaptation to the Defoe classic. The sole survivor realistically struggles to survive and finds some interseting ways of doing so, such as his chance discovery that certain rocks gave off scarce oxygen. He sets himself up pretty well, then is surprised to discover slaves arrive with a seemingly technologically superior race.While the arrival of the alines was a bit puzzling to me - where are they from? Why don't earthmen know about them? Whey do they keep themselves hidden from humans? Are they a race of men? it is tantilizingly never made clear, also a mark of good scifi. There is nothing that ruins the mystery of it, which is fun and had lived in my imagination since my father took me to see this when I was 8.Thus, I would recommend this, but the superdeluxe price is a bit out of range, to say the least."
4,An excellent transfer,"Criterion has once again produced and excellent DVD transfer. Sound and picture quality are excellent. If you are a fan of this movie, you have to get this dvd."
3,Hardly Worth the Criterion Treatment,"I remember watching this film on TV when I was a child and being very fond of it, but when looked at without any rose tinted nostalgia this is at best a B-grade movie. I'm a huge fan of Critierion and own a large number of their special editions and they have done their usual fine job here, but to me the source material just isn't worth the bother or the extra cost."
3,"Great picture, but what's with the sound?","The DVD packaging for this film promises remastered sound and picture quality. Well, given its age and the fact that it was only shot on 2-perf Techniscope the picture quality is just fine, showing up the cinematography and effects to their best advantage. So far so good. But what about the sound?Oh, boy. What *about* the sound? Maybe I just have a faulty copy, but the sound levels fluctuate wildly, badly distorting the music and sound effects (though not so much the dialogue). It's just horrible. It's almost like somebody put the sound through a limiter, so that every time it gets above a certain level it drops right down again. If my copy really is typical then on the basis of the sound quality there's no way I can give it a 5-star rating and Criterion ought to be ashamed."
5,Watched it Every Year...,"..as a kid! LOL! This has just been recently added to my collection. REALLY EXPENSIVE, but worth it. I'm not used to paying $20+ dollars for a sci-fi fix! I have a copy that I recorded off of TBS one late night back in the 90's. But, now I have the DVD! And all the extras it came with! Outstanding! Such an adventure - I loved watching it on local TV stations when I was a kid! You never see that anymore, so I had to buy it! Again, loved how they reverence God and His creation of the Universe! That's what separates the sci-fi of yesteryear from today. Thank you Criterion."
4,Robinson Crusoe on Mars,"I love this film!! The story is great and it is a wonderful classic of sci-fi.I find the struggles of Crusoe to survive and his lonliness compelling. Then he finds ""Friday"" and together they must try to hide from ""Friday's pursuers. Crusoe learns the true meaning of friendship and compassion.Wonderful effects for that time period and some really funny moments as well."
5,Robinson Crusoe On Mars,While a little dated and somewhat out of the box this Classic a good view on a slower night.
5,funky title...excellent movie,I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for a long time and it's finally out and it's the criterion edition to boot...excellent storyand Paul Mantee's only starring role...hits a bulls-eye..very enjoyable movie to see
5,Very cool and it's about time!,"Been a long wait to see this DVD released, but it's great to know it's a Criterion release so it should be awesome! I love this movie, very hard script to keep the audience engaged with so few actors but it works. Very engaging story line, well done special effects and the overall feel of the movie make this a 5 star classic sci fi must see!"
4,Robinson Crusoe on Mars - Criterion Collection,"I saw this movie when it came out as kid and never forgot it, so was pleased when I recently found it to buy. Kinda partly (in a small way) why I became a Naval Aviator. It wasn't quite as good as I remembered as a kid, but pretty good for it's day, I suppose, but again, is still kinda pricey for what it is. But the extra stuff on the DVD was really interesting of what was originally planned for the movie by the original producer, but was never used by the new producer for what sounds like typical movie political BS. If this movie is remade with today's technology using the original plans for the 1st movie, the new movie would be a box office hit, particularly as more and more interest evolves about Mars."
5,One of the Best Ole Sci Fi,Awesome for when it was made. Even stars a very young Spokes Father from Star Trek and the ever known Batman Adam West. Got to see how the good Sci Fi movies were made in the day!!!!
3,I Can't Wait to Meet My Daddy,"I really like the words of this book; however, I didn't particularly care for the abstract illustrations. My son thought it was just ""okay""!"
4,I can't wait to meet my daddy,My Mom gave this to my son-in-law for Christmas. He and my daughter are expecting their first in March. Everyone thought it was a very wonderful gift. The illustrations are beautiful !
5,Excited Grandma,We were excited to purchase this book for our son-in-law as he awaits the arrival of his first-born daughter! The kids told us when they read this book to their baby (still in the womb) they both were teary-eyed. We would recommend this book to expectant parents!
3,Book is ideal for Baby Boy....,"Even though other reviews stated this book is not gender-specific and can be used if you are having a boy or girl, I felt that it was definitely directed more toward a baby boy. Since I am having a girl, I ended up returning the book.With that being said, if I were having a boy, then I would have loved it. It is in the perspective of the child and it describes all the things the child is looking forward to doing with and learning from Dad.I do recommend it for those couples having a baby boy."
5,Love this book!,"Being the mother of a new father-to-be, I bought this book to be read to the baby. It is really sweet and I'm really glad I purchased it."
3,"Great text, artwork ok","I loved this little gift book for my husband but the artwork just didn't seem to go with the story. It was done in the ""impressionist"" style and hard to decipher sometimes what the picture was trying to convey. I enjoyed the book though and love reading it to my daughter still."
4,nice gift for a dad to be,I bought this book as a gift to my husband when I was pregnant with our first child. He found it very touching. I didn't care much for the illustrations but I still enjoyed the book and it made my cry.This makes a very nice and thoughtful gift.
3,Not what we expected,"I bought the book for my husband to read to our unborn daughter. I didn't know it was written for a child to actually read versus reading to the child. It's a nice book, just not what I wanted."
2,Not as good as the reviews say,I bought this product as I read the excellent reviews it got. I got it as gift for my husband during a baby shower. The books is more like a short phrase per page with not so good pictures/drawings.
2,"interesting, but limited","I felt this book was interesting, but it fell short in what I was looking for. The illustrations were well done on their own, but when text was added, the whole design was confusing. I simply feel the book is too limited for the father to be that I wanted to give it to."
1,Terrible quality; Bulb burned out after minutes of use,"Do NOT purchase this. Horrible quality. The minute I unscrewed the head from the body to insert the batteries I knew I was in trouble: Very thin aluminum body, cheap feeling plastic head, and threads that don't screw on very well. Switch is flimsy. Light bulb stopped working after only a few minutes of use. And even when it was working, it was not very bright. Very dissapointed. Not what I expected from a brand like B & L.It says ""Made in U.S. of U.S. and imported componenets"", but it seems 100% like a lame Chineese import"
3,Usual Gashapon fare,Product was exactly as expected. No surprises and I'm happy with it. Great for cube decoration.
2,"Sorry, don't bother","I bought this because of all the positive reviews, and I'm afraid I have to say I was disappointed. Near the beginning, things picked up after a certain annoying character died, and I had expectations of a reasonable experience. Sadly, in the last few episodes, believability in terms of character and plot goes right out the window. I can't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it anymore than I already have, but I found the sequence of ""twists"" and ""exciting moments"" in these last episodes to be ridiculous, to the extent that it ruined the show for me. I wish I had watched something better, and not wasted my time."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this series cause the artwork on the cover looked good. But the series was so awful. I really wanted to quit watching after only a few episodes, I forced myself to watch the whole series simply because I'd paid so much money for it. After seeing a lot of really great series come out of Japan, this series reminded me of some of the bad 80's anime that made the genre something people joked about. There's all these good reviews for this series, I don't know why, apparently I should try to sell my copy as used if it is really so amazing. I just feel like ""here have it"" I just want to give it away and get rid of the horrible blight of anime in my anime collection. It just reminds me of what a sucker I was when I bought it and how stupid I was to force myself to watch the whole story arc."
5,Awesome a little short,I have a lot of top favorites and this is one of them. Easy to follow and has a nice twist.
3,Good for two people willing to get wet.,"This is a great boat for two adults who are using it for fun only and are willing to get wet. It is not very stable, and I don't see how you could get three people in it. I wasn't able to sit on the edge without water coming in. That means, I had to sit on the floor of the boat and row from that position, which isn't very comfortable. My wife was on the flow in the front section. So, if you just want to float on a lake, fine, but don't plan on rowing any significant distance in this thing."
2,No way a 3 person boat,"The product itself is not bad. For the price it is a nice little boat to take on a calm lake. But I am assuming the people that work at Coleman must be very little people. I am an average size male and I fit comfortably in this boat, 3 people..... never. It would sink. Or atleast take on a lot of water."
3,A little unstable,"I realize it is an inflatable but I hoped it would be a little more stable. It is very hard to get into without getting wet. If you are in swimming attire and don't mind getting wet, I suppose it is not a problem. There is no way this boat could hold three people with even a modicum of comfort. Think of the boat as a giant inner tube and use it accordingly."
2,"Decent product, until it started leaking","The bar across the middle of the boat is a funky design that does not really make sense. Also, like someone else said, fitting three people on this thing is just asking for a disaster. 2 is the max capacity, without question. It was working just fine for me until one day I realized my bottom was getting more and more wet with each outting. Then I realized this thing had been leaking. If you go out once every bluemoon just to cruise on a calm lake, go for it. Otherwise, I don't recommend it for any moderate or regular type use. Light duty, but you pay for what you get."
2,Likes to leak,"We've had this boat for three summers now and use it an average of three times a year. The first two summers we had a leak or two that were easily patched and it was as good as new. This last summer however, the boat was completely useless. On three separate occasions we took it out for a day on the lake only to find a new hole ruining our fun. The holes develop along the seams over time."
3,was a good catch but.,it looks good. inflate easy and alot of people made fun of us riding in this little boat. but was a fun experience overall
4,A Warm Story,"I actually know the twins, one in particular (Roger) more than the other. Although I knew of the twins search and finding each other and I also watched on a special on television, nothing gives real incite like this book. I have almost completed it and plan to send it to the twin I have access for an autograph. A great read."
2,"Three books were packaged very poorly,volume holder was torn top and bottom.",Whoever shipped this order needs to go back to school or be properly instructed on packaging heavy books to ship.The 3-book holder was torn top and bottom and considered worthless.The books themselves are readable with crushed corners-all this could have been avoided.
4,This prescription is well worth the 20.,"This book contains what is sadly missing in many web books (a strategic approach).What, I think this book does fail to do is leave the reader with robust models, with which to develop their own understanding of how to build/apply an e-business strategy. That said unless you are going to read and work though ""Exploring Corporate Strategy"" by Gerry Johnson, Kevan Scholes you would be making a wise investment in buying, reading and then thinking about the ideas in this book. Good Luck"
5,Stunning and visionary,"You must read this if you participate in any type of commerce. I could not put it down, gave my copy to a freind and now have to re-purchace for my library. Enjoy the future, it looks fun and exciting."
4,Great readable book,This book is really giving you an insight in the new business environment. As a non english native speaker this book was readable (even after a day long work sitting in the train and trying hard not to fall asleep) this book keeps you awake and amuzed. I work as a Human Resource Manager in a hugh Multinational that's over 100 years old and for that reason maybe not the easiest to change. David gave me concrete and practical ideas to start. Without unreasonable barriers. Compared with other books about this subject this is really the most complete. And you really feel a customer by reading the book. It's written for us and not for the sake of the writer. Rest is already said by other reviewers.
2,Interesting ideas; poorly written and edited,"Some interesting ideas here. Too bad the writing is so pedantic that it takes a fair amount of willpower just to find the nuggets. This book would have been better had a talented ghost writer AND editor been on board. Also, it seems that a lot of the stuff here is untested; I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be leading my company down these paths. And I must admit a bias here: I'm very distrustful of some of these ideas simply because of the incredibly bad reputation David Siegel has among his peers in the digital world. I think Mr. Siegel would be better received as the author of a book about self promotion."
3,OK but what real innovations for the e-customer?,"Siegel makes adequate points in his book within the four sections: Principles, Practice, Prototypes and Predictions (Why are consultants obsessed with the letter P and S? - perhaps because they always want to say just one more thing..)The area he is weaker on is understanding what the e-customer actually wants. It is not enough to build more human oriented web sites with control being in the hands of the e-customer.The next steps include living, breathing, sharing minds and habitat with the e-customer in his many varied guises. And that is what Mckeowns book E-CUSTOMER does so very well. We are buying it for more than 500 of our team members. A large investment but worth so much more than the cover price. It sings and invigorates, informs and inspires. You need more than a list of alliterative titles to make me laugh and think as much as E-Customer did."
1,The worst book I ever read!,"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!If you have common sense, don't listen to the stupid people who think this book has any value. The book is made of a pile of pure stupid, simplistic ideas without any foundation. The author wrote a book about web design in 1996 and in 1999 he wrote this book, now about how people will do business in the future. The result? Just a pile of pre-dotcom-blow guru [junk]...I read this book just because I needed to do it for a course I attended and it was a torture. I wanted to throw this book in the trash can every time I finished reading one of its paragraphs, but I couldn't.If you don't believe me, just browse the book and you'll see how it stinks."
3,"Good at one time, but now very out of date","Let me preface this review by saying that I am a big fan of David Siegel and I have enjoyed his other books. However, ""Futurize Your Enterprise"" doesn't have the staying power that his other books have. This book was written in the late `90s and therefore Siegel has the same tone that many new media pundits has at that time which is a sense that nothing could sink this ship, not even God himself. As I read through it I cringed time and time again at how irrelevant some of his comments are in today's economy. This book would have been a best seller even today if the bottom had not fallen out of the Internet market. Unfortunately, this reads more like a time capsule or history book rather than contemporary business book."
5,A persuasive case for people who don't get it to WAKE UP,"This book is remarkable. It uses real world examples, hypothetical case studies and plain language to explain the Internet's revolutionary impact upon business. I plan to buy dozens and give them away to friends and acquaintances.As an investor in Internet-related businesses, I understand the enormity of the change that is occurring. David Siegel, employing a team -- or, rather, community -- of assistants to write this book, has articulated the dynamics and their implication for all companies.The future is now and this book will open the readers eyes to the present."
2,Doesn't seem to practice what he preaches,"The book was good. Great emphasis on serving the customer. AMAZINGLY he promotes his website throughout the entire book but his own website is not ready yet! Talk about practicing what you preach! If you go to his website (as of Nov. 2, 1999) it's not available yet. On the site he claims that the people who were putting it together ""didn't work out"". This certainly forced me to question many other aspects of the book."
5,El futuro en un libro verde,"El libro es revolucionario e inspirador. Es una verdadera herramienta de cambio que le permitirá entender el mundo de los negocios en-línea y le animará a enfrentarlo. Yo lo recomiendo a todo ejecutivo, administrador y por sobretodo al estratega. Si su mundo va más allá de las computadoras y el HTML, y si le apasionan la estrategia y el futuro, este es su libro."
3,Like bad tasting medicine that's good for you..,"Siegel tells it like it is, then like it should be ( in his perception) , and daringly tries to get us to think about very different scenarios for the not so distant future. You've got to get by the ""preaching"" and the subtle ""IT is the World"" flavor. Also, I question his assumption that everyone runs to the site with the cheapest goods. Most of his arguement is told using real companies, real W3. firms. The good news - he's short on theory. long on actual practise. However, by highlighting the internet industry with its debatable stock valuation he may be confusing high (short term) stock prices with long term staying power. The best part of the book was in the middle, chapters 4, 6,7 & 8 - especially if you've never ""written"" your own enterprise site."
1,Time Waisting,"Meaningless, this person obviously knows nothing about writing, trying to become a writer , look for an other job doubt waist your time writing"
3,Not sure about this one,"This book provides few if any answers (the web site is not much better). Siegal has some interesting thoughts, but when he tries to predict the e-world in 2010 it got just a bit too much for me. I'd like to know what it will be doing in 2-3 years not worrying about 10 years from now. That said the basic premise that organisations must be customer-led/driven is very valid. It's quite obvious even now that those e-businesses who build their business model on customer needs will win market share much more easily in the web-world. They just have to deliver financial performance earlier to really turn the world on its ear."
5,Futurize Your Enterprise: Business Strategy int he Age of,"This is an incredible book that you will want to read from cover to cover. It makes you think about the various structures such as horizontal or vertical approach to your customers. It has an incredible section toward the end of the book about predictions for the year 2010, that seem very insightful."
5,Read this book and the light will come on.,"There are a zillion books on the web, but David Siegel's FUTURIZE is the first book that really 'turns the light on'. I have shared this book with over 20 clients so far and have sold at least 200 through my recommendations because I truly believe this book will help companies understand exactly what they need to do to get on the Internet success train. Even those with minimal technical ability will embrace the thinking in this book because it's easy to understand and it just makes sense. For many, FUTURIZE confirms basic beliefs. For others, it helps clear the confusion. It should be required reading for every company officer and manager. It is required reading for every person in our company."
5,Outstanding!,"This is a great look into the future of business. Mr. Siegel's insights are not only thought-provoking, but are actionable. It is rare that a book can inspire one into action - this book is one of the rare ones!"
5,Enlightening!,"This book is very informative, especially during my company's move to e-commerce! DON'T MAKE THE MOVE UNTILL YOU HAVE READ THIS BOOK."
5,the best!... for anyone who want to enter the web-biz!,"With the tons of smog on the web-based book, this one is an exeptionally good one.I finish the first six chaper in one breathe, and sucking lots more that what i read for the past few months.I think only about 5 books on the net should become a required reading (the rests are just a waste of time and energy), and this one is one of them...cno: BUY IT FOR YOURSELF and YOUR WEB-TEAM!"
2,Has its place,"Siegel has done a fair job at cobbling together some of the better thoughts about e-business. Problem is Customer.com and Net Gain already did it a couple of years ago. The thin ""prototypes"" of businesses that Siegel covers have existed for years too. So it is really a book that is a couple of years too late (like Siegel's promised futurizenow companion web site --which is a shell as of early Nov -- ouch! credibility gap).However Futurize does have a place as a quick reference or if I had a dumber than a rock boss that I was trying to spoonfeed, I'd likely choose Siegel's book."
3,What about everybody else?,"I found this book to be an excellent resource guide for businesses going into the internet and wishing to expand their citizenship in that community. What I found disturbing in some of David's scenarios is the growing technological elite. It is a fact (look at Wall Street and recent IPO's) that those that work in and understand the internet and related technology are creating a new class, the ""technological elite"". Those who understand and have the technology at their fingertips, and those who do not. This is resulting in a widening economic gap, with all its attendant problems in our society. For the future visualized in this book to be a reality, we must make this technology available to our society at large, regardless of socio-economoc condition."
3,Living in the Real World,The author expounds a great theory in customer-led business. He doesn't address how to transform the current fiefdom corporation into his new view. This is a great book if you are starting out on your own or you work with open-minded colleagues. It is out of reach for most companies.
2,Not worth throwing a life saver,"Although the 77's have had great accomplishments in the past, this is not one of them. A big let down from their self titled album, and I think I was asking a lot when I first heard that album. Of course, I am still waiting for the re-release of the album on CD again. However, this is not anything like that and although I don't like to put down music, I think I would tell people to pass on this one in search of some of their better CDs."
1,flatware beware,"I found the flatware to be light weight, cheap feeling and looking, and doubt it is durable. Big disappointment."
1,Loving Perry Rogers,"While I have had the magnificent ability to have this man as a teacher, I found this book to be incredibly stifling. The contents often made little or no sense and had to be deciphered by the students. The book often seems loosely put together, as if there was no actual intellect used to produce it - as if the book was only published to be published and there is no other reason it should be available to the public. I do not advise anyone to read this book unless you absolutely must. This man obviously has a Napolean complex, and any further production of his books must be immediately halted."
1,"Dr. Perry Rogers, Did he skip High School?","I Fear this book may be the worst I have ever had the torture of reading. I was adviced to use this terible book in my history class, but after I read it over I would not subject my students to this even if I hated them. Roger's collection of facts and quotes are in some ways intellectual but when he attempts to connect things together with his owns words he destroys everything. Nothing he says seems to make sense, he tends to be all over the page and too opinionated. I am strongly agaisnt the banning of books but for the good of mankind I beg you to extinct this work of crap by Perry Rogers."
1,Horrible,"This net lasted only 5 months! Purchased in March, its July now and summer's not even over yet and the net's already in pieces. The quality of the net is horrible, not worth the money. Bought $5 net from Target which was higher quality than this junk."
1,horrible!,Thumbs down. This is the worst video I have ever seen. He is a clown. The footage is terrible.
1,Don't bother,"$13.00 for a tube of chap stick ($5 = shipping....) Unless you can buy this at the dollar store for 99cents, even then it's nothing great. Ill stick to my chap stick"
3,"The best from a ""home video"" recording","Featuring a mix of live performing and animation, this DVD presents an interesting doco about then on-way-to-a-fame young different band rather than an event entertaining a viewer.Producers did the best from a ""home video"" recording."
2,Oxbow Timothy Hay,"In a pinch, this hay will do. I get much fresher Oxbow products from my vet. In the future, I will purchase these products from my vet instead of online."
3,"Not so sure it made a difference, but my dogs liked it","My dog has some immunity issues so we tried this to help boost his immune system. After several weeks it wasn't apparent that this made any difference. However, he and my other dogs did love their daily ""protein shake."" I still have a ton left. I'm no longer giving it to them daily, but I think it makes a good, tasty dog treat."
2,Nature's First Immune Defense Symbiotics Colostrum,The product had a paint smell. It did not taste good and sat in my stomach a long time. I will not buy the product again.
2,i want to know the expire day for this product,"i just check out this product, but i could not find the best use date for this powder, i want to know the expire day for this product. thanks."
2,The taste is not pleasant!,"Just started using this after trying to capsule, but the aftertaste in not good. Not sure if it got changed with heat from shipping or age of product. But it is very hard to keep it down. I have mixed with Greek Yogurt with Strawberries, mixed with Milk, mixed with oatmeal and have the same unpleasant taste not matter what I mix it with. Not sure I can finish this product. I called Symbiotics customer service and they claim the aftertaste is normal. I use non flavored whey protein isolate all the time and even though sometimes it has an aftertaste, its never been as bad as this. Just thinking about it is ugh! I really want to like this product! But may have to return it."
5,Improvement in asthma and eczema outbreaks,"I have been giving this to my daughter for a couple months. She suffers from eczema and asthma and is very quick to pick up a cold. She seems to always be constipated so after consistent use of this along with a probiotic powder mixed into her warm milk, I definitely see an improvement with her bowels and her bouts with both eczema and cold-induced asthma attacks seem to be diminishing. She has gotten 1 cold in the last few months and this says a lot because she recently started preschool. Knock on wood, I really hope to see more improvements....I am hopeful actually. Very happy with the results so far."
3,Not sure.,"My mother recommended these to me, she read they're supposed to be good for people with ulcerative colitis or other gastrointestinal diseases. I have a few other conditions that it's supposed to be good for as well. I took the pills as directed on the bottle and finished the bottle. I honestly didnt notice much of a change in anything or how I felt. But I can't say for sure what they did for me, I haven't noticed anything since I've stopped taking them either. I'm sure they're a great supplement for overall health, however, since I didnt see any changes, and I'm already on so many pills already, I didn't buy another bottle."
2,Bad customer service,"The customer service at Symbiotics is very unprofessional. I was trying to get in touch with them 3 times in order to get the proof of their statement that the cows were not treated with anything. I give the product to my children; I would think twice to buy it from the same company, which cannot provide documents to prove the statement."
1,NASTY!!!,"I've taken two other brands of Colostrum (in a tablet form) which were fine. This on the other hand tasted and smelled like sour milk. Opening the jar made me nauseous. (Months later, I still get repulsed just remembering trying it!) Plus, it wouldn't even dissolve in water.Since it tasted so bad, I thought maybe I could use it topically for a problem my daughter had on her skin. She literally gagged and almost vomited!I thought it might have been a bad batch and called the customer service, which was a waste of time. After weeks of trying, I could NOT get a call back from the company or an email response. That is a bad sign if a company is difficult or impossible to reach.I've been satisfied with the taste of Synertek's Colostrum Tablets. (They're not delicious, but they're fine.)"
2,A rather useless jar of stuff,"I have several health challenges, and work out daily. At the least, I thought it might help with recovery, stamina or energy while working out, but it didn't. As for my general health, I didn't find that it helped with my energy level, nor did it have any affect on my immune system/strength. The bottom line is that I won't be buying it again, and while I got through nearly the entire jar, there is some remaining, which I probably won't bother with.Basically, it's cow's milk. Years ago, I favored Transfer Factor over the colostrum products, and now I remember why."
2,"Free of rBSTs, pesticides, and antibiotics? Who knows?","""Symbiotics colostrum plus is from pasture-fed Grade A dairy cows that are free of rBSTs, pesticides, and antibiotics."" It says nothing about this on the container so is it really true?"
1,"Inconsistent quality, texture and color from jar to jar","I have ordered several jars of this brand. The powder in the first jar was off-white and the consistency of flour. The subsequent jars contained a powder which was yellowish in color and had a consistency more like cornmeal. I sent one jar back, thinking the product was old. However, when I reordered, the jar I received contained the same type of powder.The smaller jars I have bought in the store contain the off-white, flour-like powder. I'm not sure if the problem with the powder in the larger jars results from the powder being older, or is a result of inconsistency in the manufacturing process. I wonder about the processing of the colostrum, given the inconsistency in the powder from jar to jar.I won't buy any of this brand in the larger jars for this reason. I am hoping to find another brand which is more consistent."
2,Strange taste,"I took the new zeland made chewable tablet colostrum before, which tasted fresh and good. But this one tasted like milkprodut outdated, unpleasant. Yet the expiration day is 2013. Is this common with powder colostrum?"
1,This IS NOT PETRA performing!!!,This item claims to be a collection of PETRA in Spanish.It is not Petra performing the songs. I have listened to the original albums and there is no way that this is Petra doing the songs.Some other band with some other singers are doing Petra songs.If you want Petra in Spanish go withEn AlabanzaIt is actually Petra performing the songs in Spanish.Or tryJekyll & Hydeit is the Jekyll and Hyde album in Spanish actually performed by Petra!
4,"Heavy leather, but a little snug","Leather is good quality, jacket is heavy and it took a couple weeks to truly break in.My only issue with it was how snug it was, I got a size 48, which matches my 50'' chest, however, it was too tight to keep the protection in, so I had to take out the pads. Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to go a size higher, as the the length of the sleeves are already pretty long on this one.Overall, for the price, I don't think there is a better deal, for the thickness of the leather and quality."
4,Perfect size,Finally an angel food cake pan that I know will take all the batter without spilling over. Cake releases easily and cleanup is quick and even quicker if you use a clean old toothbrush to get in the bottom ridge.
5,great!,I bought this angel food cake pan to replace my 40 year old 2-piece pan that had started to leak cake batter onto my oven floor. This is not a fun thing to have to clean up. This new Chicago professional Angel Food Cake pan is extremely nice and it has built in feet to rest it on while it cools. I used to invert my old pan over an old wine bottle kept around for that purpose. I intend to start giving this pan to new brides.
4,Definitely Nonstick!,"I chose this pan based on magazine reviews and reviews on Amazon, and I am pretty happy with it. It is a good weight, not flimsy, and the cake batter doesn't leak out between the pan and the bottom. It is easy to clean, and I have not found that the batter gets stuck in the little rim on the bottom, as some reviews have stated. It is also a very nonstick pan. I baked a cake in it and turned it upside down to cool, and a few minutes later happened to glance over and saw my cake dumped out on the counter. The cake adhered a little more firmly to the tube in the middle, so some of the middle tore, but it wasn't meant for company, so I just patched it together. Next time I think I will cool the cake upright for five minutes or so, till it firms up, and then turn it upside down to finish cooling. The upshot is, your cake will definitely release from this pan with no problem, though it may release sooner than you expected."
4,perfect angel food cake,I had been looking for a replacement of my 30 year old mirro aluminum pan and gave this a try. I am overjoyed with the results. No leakage of batter and very pleased with it having the feet for cooling. would defintely recommend
1,No Luck Yet...,"Three orange sponge cakes attempted, three orange sponge cakes ripped, crumpled, and generally ugly-looking. I will not use this pan again...I have been baking orange sponge cakes since my wife and I got together (it's her favorite cake) = 28-years of experience = (probably) >200-cakes. I have never had a failure with my old cheap aluminum tube pan (which I got rid of because cutting the cake out of the pan resulted in aluminum shavings in the sides of the cake, and ingesting aluminum isn't exactly recommended). I also never had a failure usingCalphalon Classic Bakeware 10-Inch Round Nonstick Angel Food Cake Pan, but I went to this one because it's two-part (like my old aluminum pan) so easier (in theory) to get the bottom of the cake out."
5,Mom's cake pan,My mom loves this new pan. She has made several cakes in it so far & now my aunt wants one. So I am going to order another one & ship it to my aunt. It is a very nice cake pan & the cake is just beautiful when it is done. I would highly recommend this pan to anyone who is baking & likes to have a nice cake when finished.
4,Good deal cake pan,"Works very well, completely as advertised. Rated highly on Cooks Country, they are NEVER wrong. Service was fast and highly efficient with Amazon. We ordered a slightly damaged pan, which was indicated as packaging damage, thought how bad could the pan itself be....once again it was just as described, the box was slightly damaged and the pan was perfect. Quite happy with all aspects of this purchase, you will do well to buy this pan over all others available."
1,Leaves a taste,"I've always thought the toasty sides of angel food cakes were the best part, but strangely, this pan leaves an odd sort of metallic taste. I thought I was doing something wrong with ingredients, but finally figured out that the cake tastes fine as long as I cut off about 1/4 inch of anything that touches the pan. Needless to say, it's way too late to return it. I only bake angel food about once a year, so it took awhile to figure what was happening. Hope this helps someone else."
4,"Listed dimensions are wrong!! 9.5"" NOT 10.5""","As another reviewer stated, the dimensions in the Amazon product listing are wrong! I haven't used the pan yet, so can't comment on its performance--but be warned that this pan is NOT 10.5"" as stated, but is 9.5"".Annoying, since I bought the pan specifically because I was looking for 10.5"" diameter. This pan was rated highly by Cook's Country (offshoot of Cooks Illustrated) so I'm sure it will perform well, but disappointed that Amazon didn't get the listing info right."
5,Great meditation,This book gives great meditations on the Saint days. So you understand the readings and the Saint. The only problem is that you need the Daily conversations with God daily meditations for the ordinary days.
5,A Fantastic Book,"This book was a total joy, having been obsessd with the saga of Fanny and Robert Louis Stevenson myself. Pamela Stephenson(no relation) buys a yacht and follows the exact passage of the south seas voyage of the Stevensons, with a full crew and her teenage daughter Scarlett. A book to treasure (no pun intended) and one I will dip into again and again, whenever I need feminine inspspiration. Go Pamela!"
5,ESTUPENDO FILM,"ESPERO QUE SE EDITE LO ANTES POSIBLE ESTE FILM QUE PUDE VERLO EN EL CINE PERO ESTOY ANSIANDO VOLVER A VERLO EN CASA, EN EL FORMATO DE DVD."
1,Other than that...,"Altough Yafa does include a few useful tidbits of information, his malice for and bias against the cotton industry ultimately precludes this book as a good source for useful information. Yafa's bias renders his judgement suspect, and what could have been a fascinating tale becomes yet another piece of propaganda."
2,Letter A,Nothing wrong with product but I find it totally useless.I had amazon card left with some balance so bought it.
4,Still solid at times.,"While not the best Outlanders to be written the series can still beat most of the current Deathlands on a good day.My main problem is the new turn the series is taking if the Barons have all been defeated and the whole ""Aliens controlling humanity"" plotline has been done away with then what is the point anymore? Its just Deathlands with Sin Eaters and Sand cats with Kane and Grant replacing J.B and Ryan."
5,Just perfect for me,"I've had this now for 3 months (10 hours/day of business) and have been wary of other reviews but I must say that the set is absolutely perfect in terms of picture quality whether it's HD or Analog too. After learning how to tweak the Colors which are always over saturated by most stations I have No complaints. When using DVD I noticed that there is NO Color deviation since the signal is pure so the presets are just fine. PC is also excellent at 1360x768 which comes up easily with a Good Video Card and driver and there is No Ghosting at all. Universal remote runs both TV, Cable & Teac Amplifier. So NO Red problems actually and speakers are so so but just use a subwoofer to augment them. Response time is 16ms too. Just remember when using a PC to always use the Native resolution, use the DVI input, select ""Clear type for text effects & Sharpness will put the final touch on things."
4,priced to sell???,"Seems like $413.00 is a bit of a high price for this excellent paperback book, especially when you can download it for free from the Harvard Medical School web site & then print it out (as I did). Even though the research is circa 30 years old, the book still gives an excellent description of the many facets of our vision and how they were discovered via painstaking research."
5,Roseanne Cash -Seven year ache,"Seven year ache was the first song I ever heard Roseanne sing,I just had to get the album after that.A Damn good album it is,too! The fist song Rainin,Rocks like Pat Benatar,very cool. The second song is the song that was her destiny to perform,the great Seven Year Ache. The third song is a torch song called Blue moon with heartache,hauntingly beautiful. Song #4 is 'What kind of girl?was written by the guy that wrote Romeo's tune,pure Rockabilly. Next is You don't have very far to go which is a pure country tune. Song #6 is another rocker called My baby thinks he's a train,Like a sexier Linda Ronstadt kinda thing. Tune 7 is a midtempo pop song called Only Human. The 8th song is more classic country called 'Where will the words come from'. There is also a pretty good cover of a Tom Petty song, and 2 more that are kind of lame. Overall this album Kicks Ass. 5 Stars!"
2,Dissappointment.,"I love these guages, so much. I expected to get both gauges as in a PAIR seeing as usually you'd pay anywhere from $14.00-$20.00 for gauges that come in pairs. That was why I decided to pay $24.00 (without shipping) for a nice SET of gauges but when this one arrived, I was dissappointed in myself for not actually reading what the description of this product was but more dissappointed in Pierce This 2 for putting up a picture of the gauges AS A SET making it seem like someone ordering could get both gauges. (For someone to order just one is weird because no one gauges just one ear.) My advice? Pierce This 2, please either change the picture or sell them both for the price you'd like because I made a mistake, yes, but yours is very unreasonable. Thankssss (:"
4,Pricy But Good Quality,"I really enjoyed wearing these gauges. Yes they are pricey, yes they do not come as a pair. My biggest problem with them was that they would occasionally slip out of my ear and for the price you could imagine how many near panic attacks I had when I realized something was missing! Would not recommend wearing these while sleeping or showering or at the pool since they do have a tendency to fall out since they are so smooth. Overall you might be better off buying a gauge that is less likely to fall out."
2,"beautiful cards, but flimsy and cheaply made","I ordered this deck because I saw some of Willows gorgeous art prints at a local store. The artwork is simply exquisite, but I can only give 2 starts to this set because it is so cheaply made. The ""card""stock is flimsy and the entire set was poorly made, starting with the box that contains this set, down to the box of the deck and the cards themselves. What a shame! Otherwise I would give it 5 stars...."
2,Very Poor Quality,"I'll make this short. I loved the artwork and psychological concept of this deck. It was truly beautiful and innovative. The reason I gave this 2 stars is because the paper quality of the cards is absolutely awful. I returned mine! A set this expensive with such poor quality cards in inexcusable. The publisher should be ashamed. I think it is a widespread problem, as I saw similar comments for the Tarot of Paris, which is published by the same people. If you plan on using this deck for readings I'm not so sure its worth the $$ - as I can't see the cards lasting very long. In addition to the very very thin paper stock, many of the edges were jagged. The author and the artist should really have a word with the publisher. It is a shame!"
3,Beautiful deck but...,"I have to agree with the other folks here who have already said, the deck is very beautiful, I love the art work, But the cards are just too thin! This deck is much too expensive for the cards to be so flimsy, one of mine got bent and has a big crease down the middle from doing a reading the very first day. I also have to say that I was a little unhappy about the changed interpretation of traditional cards."
5,Guarranteed Transformation,"I love this book! My friend and I were using her copy. I loved it so much and found it so right on that I had to have my own. The illustrations are beautiful and powerful. The words are , oh... so inspiring and insightful. They lead you on the most positive path to healing. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to better themselves and the world around them."
1,Beware of drop down menus,"Ordered a set of these shades for my 2012 Kia Soul, the guy that processed my return said that Amazon has ""issues"" with its drop down ordering system that ""really need to be addressed"" The shades that were sent to me were for a full size Ford pickup, not even close to what i wanted. There was no way to verify or double check if I was ordering the right ones or even include a notation to the company of the car that they were being ordered for."
4,WWE wrestler,My son loves playing with his WWE action figures. He really wanted Mike Knoxx and this toy of him looks just like him. My son bangs and tosses it around and it seems to be holding up to his abuse!
2,Trance-Formations,This video is not what I expected. For those of you looking for an instuctional video this is not it. The video basically highlights all the different trance-formations. These trances were not really involved and complete. I gave it 2 stars just because of the bubbly yet strange personality Shelley Lessin Stockwell presented.
4,Practical things come first,Very well organized and practical video. Could be recommended for people who read Grinder and Bandler's books on NLP and transformation. The tape gives enough clues for practical work even if you don't have a chance to attend a seminar on the topics discussed
2,"Better than Part 1, but.....","While this is marginally better than Part 1, City of Iron, I still feel this series leaves a lot to be desired. While the ""prisoner"" idea is interesting, I still feel many of the characters are little more than cardboard cut-outs. Once again, I cannot recommend this series, though I do think Mr. Williamson has written some far better books (including his Crow novel)"
2,Doesn't Weahter well,We bought this a year or so ago... it turned greyish white and then the orange C flaked off. It's actually vinyl (or appears to be) and then clear coated. The clear-coat turned milky and then flaked off.
5,AWESOME hitch cover!,"Durable, looks great! It is a metal hitch cover with raised lettering and logo that are painted and sealed. We bought this last winter and it still looks brand new. I'd recommend this to anyone."
5,Compelling from the Very First Page,"This book will grab your attention from the very first page and not let you go until you have read to the end and closed the covers on the book.You won't believe what Mrs. Billig went through, and what a heroic, amazingly dedicated mother she is.What is most unbelievable and shocking about the story is not so much the very sad and tragic disappearance of Amy, but instead the constant stalking and harrassment **Mrs. Billig** went through! And yet she and her husband remained strong and true to the end.If you want a book that you won't be able to put down, buy this one. But be prepared to cry and also to seethe with anger by the time you are done."
4,Excellent book,I have read this book atleast 3 times. It is an excellent book about a mother that went through everything humanly possible to find her daughter. The mother went from a woman who had a care free life to a strong and brave woman who put herself in many dangerous situations because she loved her daughter so much.
2,Love oxbow...but this isn't that great!,"This stuff is okay once in a while, but a little too expensive to use instead of the timothy hay. The guinea pigs weren't that thrilled by it."
3,"Rabbit eats it, but not favorite type of Oxbow hay","Title pretty much says it all... I got a variety of the Oxbow minibales for our rabbit to see what his hay preferences are. He much prefers the Western Timothy and Orchard Grass to this stuff, but he will eat a bit of this as well. In the future will probably not be repurchasing, though, as he eats more if I give him the other stuff."
4,Heaven Rejoices - Story of an Ex-Witch,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I was very put off by the Publisher's note on the back; ""Irene Park was once the High Witch of Florida..."" Having some knowledge of these things I felt it was shameless hyperbole and I was all set to dislike and debunk the book.Instead I found Irene's story moving, compelling and honest on a gut-level. I am glad I persevered. Though 20 years old, this little book has timeless relevence and strikes at the heart of the issue of good vs. evil in man.I highly recommend this book to those considering joining Wicca or any other Pagan or Earth-based religion. I have ordered additional copies of it to give away to people I meet who are either involved or thinking about getting involved in the occult.Sincerely,Rev. Cathian C. Surbrook, DD"
1,cracked all to pieces cases,"I was very disappointed on when I received my dvds in the mail both dvd cases were bursted up very badly. the box was all bent up to pieces as well. The DVDs were fine and play good, but I'm disappointed on how they were shipped. I don't want my money back on the dvds all I want is to make sure you do a better job on shipping your items in next time."
3,"Scientific, Covers In-Depth Information","The reading is somewhat dry, yet very informative. Author sites many studies and reviews to back his knowledge. Great for night shift workers to help understand fatigue, yet there aren't good recommendations for combating or dealing with said fatigue."
5,Gran colección,Disfruté completamente de este álbum. Aquí están las listas de canciones:1. Chaparrita2. Cantinero Amigo3. Martin Amezcua4. Enamorado5. La Fe Perdida6. Mentalidad De Nina7. Bonita8. La Mentira9. Jacinto Perez De La O10. El Rebozo De Mi Madre
4,if you love robben you will dig this,I agree with the others - good - sometimes great disc but not the end all be all album that we all believe he has in him...as a fan of robben ford I couldn't imagine not buying this....would love to hear robben put it all together in one cohesive sounding album.....is it me or do certain tracks sound different (mix/production values) than others??
4,i agree good not great,"I would rate it a good not a great album like some of his earlier works. I rate it good because I'm a big Robben Ford fan. It has some good songs and some not so good songs. It's one I like better the more I listen to it, but it still only a good album. The first time I listened to it i wasn't too excited but it's getting better.But I'm still a big Robben Ford fan. Other big artists have an album or two that's just so-so."
3,Disappointing,"I am one huge fan of Robben Ford, but this album to me is just blah. There is not a single track on it that truly shows what is unique about Robben's approach to blues guitar. What makes him such a master is the seamless way he blends his jazz influences (primarily according to him Miles Davis and John Coltrane) into a blues guitar style. There is little if any of that on this effort.Yes, I love his tone on this, but the playing is just so ordinary. If I want to hear someone play straight blues guitar, I'll put on BB, Albert, Freddie, Clapton in the Bluesbreakers, or SRV."
2,Makow the mad cow,Reading this book one wonders if Makow is looking for a slave or a wife. I have no respect at all for this jerk. Get a life guy....
4,Geeez!,"Henry brings good details which lures its readers into this mixed up relationship that started off on the wrong foot. He makes the mistake of bringing his American customs with him to the Philippines and acts like a spoiled brat expecting Filipino traditions to bend backwards for him. Much of the time he ""insists"" on having things done his way in a country where his way is considerd disrespectful. He should have been way more sensitive to that. This is a story of one immature Filipina not even close to being ready for marriage and the other, a narrow minded unstable middle aged man who thinks he can bestow his desires and fantasies into a vessel who is also very deceptive in her ways. She knows exactly what she is, but plays it off to a man she knows is blinded to her beauty. Both of them used each other for their own agenda, thus ending in tragedy."
3,A Sad Story,"I recently returned from The Phillipines and thought this book would be an interesting read, which it was. However, what I found most interesting was the author's desperation and stupidity. After just a few days, he decides to get married to an 18 year old? Come on, he is 40 something years old, you mean to tell he did not have enough experience with women to see the signs of her immaturiy. Apparently not as he so eloquently describes in this book.This is more a story of his failings than what to expect if you interested in marrying a Phillipina. With that said, I do recommend reading this book if you have ever had dealings with Asian women, I read this in one day and found it sad but humorous."
4,An open-ended story,"Henry Makow, inventor of the ""Scruples"" board game, plays the role of the last honorable man looking for the last honorable wife well. As I'm reading along, I'm searching for clues as to where this relationship is going to end up - Nirvana, or train wreck? Unfortunately, there isn't enough information to generalize from Henry's spoiled and ultimately treacherous beauty queen Cecilia to Filipina culture at large. Was she a bad apple, or representational of international sexual politik?Although you're expecting to discover some problems due to cultural difference alone, what you don't expect is the rapid descent into post-Sam Kineson domestic hell that explodes almost out of nowhere once they marry and move back to Canada. Henry's honest take on cultural feminism at the end might have served better as a prologue; but the bigger question is: Will Henry go back and try again?For a female counterpart to Henry's journey, check out Cleo Odzer's ""Patpong Sisters."""
1,Lousy design,"The plastic nozzle did not hold on the pump outlet, was falling off. I taped it to the pump with duct tape. Then it was functional, but could inflate my inflatable mattress only half-way. To inflate it completely, I had to use my manual pump. I returned the product to Amazon for full refund, including my return shipping."
1,DID NOT WORK,"I ordered this and, in haste, did not check to see if it worked. Packed it up with my camping gear and when I needed to use it at the camping site....it did not work. Seemed like a faulty connection and we tried with several cars. I did not realize there return time was 4 weeks and when I went to print an RMA...the return time had expired. I should have gone with the Colemen as Intex seems to be a crappy brand."
2,Weak pump,If you want to get the job done don't waste your money. Nothing beats an a/c unit for power and dependability.
3,Good product,When purchased I was expecting the battery operated pump as advertised. Instead the 12 volt (vehicle) pump was sent. The pump was bought as a back up. It appears it will work fine.
5,good mower,"I received the hand reel mower in new conditio. After I assembled it and mowed the lawn with it, it worked very good. I would recommend it."
4,Sturdy light reel mower,Good mower for small areas. Assembly was a little time consuming but relatively straight forward. I concur with previous review stating the mowers main advantage is minimum weight. Compared to other reel mowers I've used this one is easy to use and move around.
4,Nice little mower!,"I am pleased with our little hand lawn mower. We have a small patch of grass that we enjoy in our small yard, and this is perfect for mowing it. I need the exercise, hate the noise of power tools, as many of my neighbors probably do, and it cuts well. I recommend that it be used according to the instructions with regular lubrication. Also, I found that small twigs will stop it cold, so rake them up if that is a condition of your lawn area. Obviously, a larger or more powerful mower should be bought for larger lawns."
4,Good little mower,"I have a small yard with a few trees and a fence -- it's a pain to mow it with our big fancy mower. This little hand reel mower is perfect for me. It was SUPER easy to assemble -- no tools needed, and I was up and running with it in 10 minutes. Did a great job, it's very light and very easy to use. The reason I'm only giving it four stars is because it left a few stubborn weeds behind. I am thrilled to not have to deal with gas, oil, spark plugs, etc. I highly recommend this for people who have small lawns."
4,"Great, Easy Mower for a small lawn","I was really pleased with this mower. I live in a duplex and share a lawn with my neighbor so I do not have much lawn to take care of so this was a perfect mower for me. I don't have to worry about gas or some big bulky machine needing a large space to store it. It cuts grass easily, the only thing it might miss is tall weeds. Also you have to watch out for sticks because that stops the blades."
4,It's more than adequate,"After selling our big suburban house--with a big suburban lawn that we paid to have cut--we moved to a city house with just enough grass to require cutting. The previous owners left this mower in the garage, and I decided to use it, since a power mower seemed excessive. Other than not being able to get close to the edges of several mulched beds, this mower works just fine. It takes me 10 or 15 minutes to go over the grass several times, and eveything looks neat. I recently had the blades sharpened, and it performs even better than when I first began to use it. It's free, it's exercise (albeit limited), and it doesn't use fossil fuel--what's not to like? I can't understand the difficulties the other reviewers have experienced, and I have also seen a number of Great States mowers around our neighborhood. Maybe the older mowers were better built? There's also something quite gratifying about cutting the grass early in the morning without disturbing the neighborhood."
4,My review,A very nice and light hand reel mower. The best part of the mower that it is soo light. Only minor drawback is that the blades could be sharper. Buying a basic sharpiner is cheap and easy to do
3,"Mow, mow,mow your lawn","Forget motorized lawn mowers. This item is pure American--gritty, old-fashioned and sturdy. Most important, it does the job.I would recommend it for anyone who has a medium sized lawn, unless you are a glutton for physical punishment. Pushing this lawn mower with a small trajectory over a large lawn can be painful to your joints, legs and everything else!One thing though. The blades need sharpening at least once a year, and never try to mow a wet lawn with this. Because it only works on muscle power, it gets stuck even with a little bunch of wet grass.All in all, ideal for small lawns."
4,Great Small Light Mower,"This is a very small mower - so it may not be what you're looking for! HOWEVER if you are actually looking for small on purpose, you will like this mower alot. A list of its pluses includes: very light and manueverable for squeezing around and between yard obstacles like plantings, walls etc; sharp, smooth cutting blades are easy to push through grass; grass blades are cut small enough that there is no need to collect - just leave as mulch, you won't see the cut blades in your grass; small frame fits in tiny storage areas; does not throw rocks and debris at my legs like the stinky string trimmer!!!! I'm very satisfied! For me, the only negative is that it does get snagged on sticks. I don't tend to have alot of sticks though so I'm happy. If your trees drop alot of sticks you would probably not want this mower."
3,OK...,It isn't very wide and you will have to retrace much of your work. It works best right before you water- when the grass is at it driest- also not very good with crab grass.
2,90 day warranty?,"Who is willing to buy a new product that only has a 90 day warranty? That is the typical warranty on used product. If the manufacturer has little faith in their product, then neither do I."
2,"Difficult to use, returned it.","Unfortunately, I let my grass grow too long all the time. This item was worthless to me so I returned it."
4,Sturdy but for Small Yards,"I purchased this product a month ago and have used it quite a bit. Its a great little lawnmover and gets the job done BUT it does get stuck if you push it though really thick grass and it will skip over extra tall weeds. With that being said, its been great for me as I have a small backyard and mow the grass about once a week."
3,Good Product,It is good exercise. It is narrow but if you are willing tp put the work in this mower works well.
2,Mower review,"Well, it does cut the grass, but don't let it get too high or you will have a hard time getting it too mow. By too high I mean anything over about 3"". Will not cut all grass, leaves a lot behind that it will not cut."
3,Great For The Price,Great push mower for a small lawn. Excellent price and easy to assemble without need of extra tools. This is winner for the money.
3,can get better and creaper,the mower is fine but can get one better and cheaper from lowes.If you don't hav shipping cost it would be better
1,Way too hard!,"I have small strip of grass to cut 18"" x 100', so I thought this would be perfect, but I have to mow it 4 times in every direction to cut it! It needs a running start for any long grass too. A nightmare! I'm going electric."
2,Ok mover.,It cuts the grass well but many times unevenly. There is no tray to collect thr cut grass and it gets scattered around.
5,Old-fashioned is great.,"I received this product on time and with no problems. It was easy to assemble and has worked great for several mowings. If you want a low price, no pollution, and to get exercise when you mow your lawn, this fits the bill. Definitely not for large yards but great for small ones. If you have lots of twigs or sticks falling in your yard, don't get this as they tend to stick in the blades."
1,not happy,"I really dont know why this company would bother to manufacture such a piece of junk. It didnt cut the grass, it fell apart within minutes. I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this item. It really dosent deserve the 1 star. I feel like I would be leading someone on to maybe give it a try, and it would probably be someone like me who really cant afford to lose the shipping costs."
3,Reel lawn mower,"It does the job if the grass isn't too tall, but you get quite a workout in the arms, shoulders, back and legs. After each pass on the grass, you have to move the reel with your foot to unstick it. Not so sure I would recommend it to anyone. Maybe a larger, more expensive one would work better. This one is nice and compact and stores easily. Used it twice...had a yard guy come mow the grass for me since it is so hard to use. I got a grass catcher with it and a blade sharpener. Haven't been able to figure out how to attach the grass catcher to the lawn mower. No instructions came with it and you just have an illustration to look at which does not explain the process at all. As far as the sharpener goes, have not used mower enough to sharpen the blades. Update: My husband likes this lawn mower, but he says he does a lot of weedeating to cut down spots he couldn't get with the mower. He also says he gets a great workout using it just as I said in the earlier review."
4,Very Durable Reel Mower,Great item! The mower doesn't cut high grass too well but it can withstand much abuse as I have cut a path through an overgrown field reasonably well. Don't worry about the low price. It's just as good as most reel mowers over $$$$.
4,Love this mower!,"It's easy to push and it cuts the grass nicely. It even tackled tall grass with ease! Great workout for the arms, too! I actually prefer this to my gas powered, self-propelled lawn mower. I love that I can get up early in the morning and mow when it is still cool without worrying about disturbing the neighbors!"
4,Works!,"I have a little patch of land in front of my townhouse that needs to be mowed periodically and this worked great. Yes, it takes a little effort but its well worth it!"
1,Games for boring people,Don't waste your time buying this book. Most teenagers would not find the book naughty in any way. Prudes might think this book is useful but anyone who has lived a little will find it a complete waste of time.
4,This is Sinfully Delicious!,"Where the hell has this guy been? I can not *wait* to try these games out with friends (and strangers ;-) alike). If you don't have a copy, you're not just missing out, honey, you *ain't* the life of the party! Nuff' said."
5,Excellent product,"The entire set is made of durable wood. The ""candles"" have ""flame"" inserts. The frying pan comes with two latkes and there is a dreidel with 6 wooden pieces of gelt.Our 3 year old loved it this Chanukah--he would put the menorah together after we lit the real candles. He also enjoyed the dreidal and the frying pan.This object is sure to last many years. Highly recommended."
3,"Lackluster version of Handel's opera, Xerxes","A nearly emotionless, lackluster version of Handel's Xerxes, softened by fine voices and nice instrumentation. The singing, particularly in the last act, has little emotion and too much self conscious control, even for a piece in this historical era."
3,No English libretto,"The large 80-page booklet accompanying this recording contains only an Italian libretto, making it difficult for English speakers to follow the story."
3,Welcome Race Fans,"This album is Dakoda's follow-up to ""Into the Son."" It's is more classic 60's rock styled then their first album, and it provides only two main stlyes on the album, Rock and Country. In comparison to their first album ""Into the Son,"" which shows versitility,""Welcome race fans"" Offers content in its deeper lyrics."
2,Not their best work.,"Dakota Motor Company debuted several years ago with a hot, lively first album, ""Into the Sun""; that earned them some recognition which prompted the broader release of this, their second album. With this release they lost the vibrance that had made ""Into the Sun"" unique and brilliant and replaced it with a loud, graceless ""hard rock""."
1,BAD Door Bell,The one part of the bell is broke after it was installed only 2 days.....WITH NO USE! The chime still goes off on its own...spooky. I would NEVER get another one like this.
1,"Mr. Horse, what are your feelings on the post-John K. Ren & Stimpy?","No sir, I didn't like it.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
1,Viaco has done it again,"I don't own this DVD, but I've heard about what happened. Even THESE episodes have cuts in them. Although they are the Games episodes, they deserve to be edited, but that's not how DVDs should be. There's only 1 extra on it. It just proves that Paramount Home Video is just completely careless and makes DVDs on a tight budget. The fans have suffered long eough."
1,terrible product SCRATCHED,I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AND IT WAS CERTAINLY USED!!! EXCHANGED FOR ANOTHER ONE AND THIS WAS ALSO SCRATCH. AMAZON IS SELLING USED PRODUCTS AND NOT INSPECTING THE PRODUCTS BEING RETURNED. THEY JUST SHIP OUT THE SAME PRODUCT SOMEONE ELSE RETURN AFTER ABUSING THE PRODUCT. BEWARE OF PUCHASING DVD'S FROM AMAZON. VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER
4,If you like this kind of stuff,If you like Ren & Stimpy then this is a good addition. My Husband really likes the DVD.
1,"Content is OK, but....","I haven't watched all the discs yet. The content is OK, but I have a major complaint about the way the DVDs are set up. Depending how your DVD player works, you may have a problem avoiding being forced to watch previews of other DVD products. Other companies do this, but the real problem here is that the previews on the 1st disc are for South Park and Chappelle and they are very offensive. Just because you like Ren and Stimpy doesn't mean You enjoy being assaulted by those other shows. If you do watch these and there are any children or guests present, you might wish to first mute the DVD player. This is so stupid and inconvenient. If you want Chappelle, buy Chappelle, I don't want to censor that, but why do the rest of us have to be inflicted with it without choice, simply to watch Ren and Stimpy?In any event: BE WARNED -- THE DVD ADVERTISEMENTS ARE NASTY!"
1,CUT,"I am an Austrian(EU) customer and so I am forced to watch the(heavily cut)german television. I looked and recorded ""Ren & Stimpy"" from this television years ago. Now they released these two DVD-boxes(US)and I was very happy to be able (finally) to buy Ren & Stimpy ""uncut"" on DVD.Now I am very angry and disappointed to find out, that the german Television showed many scenes, that are missing on these DVD's. So the Boxes are cut and my old recordings uncut = for me are these DVD-boxes worthless. Besides the picture-quality of the DVD's is on some Episodes worse compared to my recordings.A Ren & Stimpy -fan"
4,Intrigue in the south of France,An easy and inexpensive way to enjoy the south of France! Excellent plot and character building. The author's descriptions of the landscape and architecture in Provence just take you there. I would recommend this to anyone who loves France.
1,"Same story, different title","This is the EXACT same story as the second in the Maggie Newberry series which is titled Murder a la Carte. So if you plan on buy one, don't buy the other. Why would both be represented as different novels? It is quite puzzling to me, so buy beware."
1,Sooo elementary,"Essestially the story line was cute however the language was so elementry it was pathetic. Also, as a French first language speaker, I would advise the author not to use bad French when speaking in the voice of a Frenchman. I needed to go to my osteopath, to get my jaw realligned after reading the series, from grinding my teeth. The characters were also very stereotipical. Although not an American I could not get my head around a college graduate, Maggie, being so dumb. Come on not being able to handle the language after living in the country for three years!! Why was she presented as so naive when she came from a rather sophesticated family? If a high school student handed in such a poorly written piece I would sit with her and offer some very serious editorial advice or she would have to settle for an F."
2,"Nice, but not necessarily enthralling","I adore France and having spent extensive time there, I expected this book to be set in a town much like those I know. Instead, the environment seemed more secluded than I expected. Evening upon evening passed with friends while enjoying fine food and good wine embodies the French culture. I just didn't sense that warmth in the book. Not that it is a big deal since it is not a tourism guide, but a mystery novel. Which brings me to another thought, I didn't feel that the story was compelling. Usually, when I am reading a mystery, I stay up all night once I have read past halfway, but with this book, I set it down each evening after a few pages and easily went to sleep. Sadly, I set it down several months ago and forgot all about it, now I cannot even find the book. If you prefer slow-paced mysteries, this might be just the book for you, but in my experience it was not what I expected out of a mystery novel set in beautiful france."
5,Hard to find part..from Amazon.com,"This part was hard to find but as always, Amazon came through. Part was exactly what I needed, at a fair price and delivered on time."
5,Great product!,"We bought a Freeplay a few years ago, and about 6 months ago bought 2 more. They are great. We leave them in southern windows in various rooms in the house, and just turn the radio on where ever we happen to be. Why pay the power company when you get the sun for free? Even here in Maine, we never have to wind it or plug it in to charge, unless we accidentally leave one on overnight. No, its not a high-end stereo, but for listening to the radio while working around the house, it is just fine."
5,Pleasing..,this Cd was astounding. Dave Weckl by far is one of the greatest drummers of our time and this cd is a true testament to the statement. You will enjoy. Buy it now.!
2,Not nearly as good as 'Synergy',"I am a huge Dave Weckle fan, and have seen him twice live. There are two problems with this album: First, there is the band, which really hasn't sounded very good since Jay Oliver left. Also OBVIOUSLY MISSING is Buzz Feiten on guitar. The second problem is Steve Weingart. He never sounds sweet, and every solo is so ""outside the box"" that we wonder if Mr. Weingart can play ""inside the box"". While he was on acceptable ""temporary replacement"" for Jay Oliver, the sound of Dave's band has only eroded, and it is surprising that Dave hasn't YET brought in a better keyboardist. If you want to hear Dave Weckle at his best, buy 'Synergy' or Master Plan. Also cool, check out Dave's instructional DVDs - some of them feature wonderful Wecklisms on video."
4,Intimate energy,"Frenetic double-live is a fabulously consistent, playfully intellectual, but hardly pretentious must-have for fans of progressive jazz."
3,There's A Hole In The Band,"Dave Weckl is an amazing drummer without question but what happened to his band? His keyboard man has been replaced by someone without the chops and his guitar player is gone! The resulting ensemble plays adequately, but there is no zing, no spice to the music here. I would recommend Synergy first, then Hard Wired if you don't already own some of Dave Weckl's superior music. This to me would only serve those who may have attended this particular show or caught this lineup somewhere. I still believe in you Dave! - Ciao"
4,Good Value,"I purchased this stroller because I was tired of having to kick the breaks on my Maclaren stroller in order to lock them. This stroller, which is a very similar style to the more expensive Maclaren strollers, is very well priced for everything it offers. The seat back is very easy to adjust, the breaks work great and the handles are a dream (even for tall people). I was hoping that the sun visor would attach with a hinged bracket to adjust to the sun's position, like the less expensive C6 model, but sadly it doesn't. Also, the foot rest stows in the up position so every time you open the stroller you have to put it down. That being said, I would still highly recommend it."
2,"html is dead, long live html",You mean like how DOS was supposed to be replaced by better operating systems by 1982? Really -- we're going to be stuck with plain 'ol HTML for decades.
4,"Excellent intro to XML, no programming knowledge necessary","Harold does an excellent job, assuming only a minimal knowledge of HTML and no programming background. This book is an excellent reference, but lacking in discussion of new directions in XML, particularly namespaces."
3,Covered topic ok but a little outdated.,The book seemed to cover most topics fairly well but there seemed to be disconnect between some of the pieces described. After reading the book I still don't have a completely clear understanding why XML is so hot. Especially when it would seem that I have to write my own applications to process any XML documents. Right now it seems XML is just a fancy file formating lang...the book didn't do anything to change my mind. One thing completely lacking was a discussion how XML could be used to get data in & out of a RDBMS. One of the most annoying things initially was that all of his references to microsoft XML tools/parsers/etc. do not seem to be available anymore and I finally gave up trying to run his example progs. Wish I had checked it out of the library vs. buying.
2,Out-dated,"Author makes a good point from the start. He notes that since the web public will take time to convert to XML-ready browsers, all works should be converted to HTML until technologies play a catch-up. Author's method for this HTML conversion is done through a Microsoft-DOS based utility called ""MSXSL."" Well, Guess what? Microsoft has taken this tool off the market, probably to promote it's Internet Explorer 5.0 browser which has built-in XML parser. But without the ""MSXSL"" examples starting from chapter 2 are not possible. It's a pity, since his writing on XML are well written. But it's just too hard to overcome the frustration of not being able apply your knowledge. I will return this book and use the money to buy a book with examples of IE5 - the 'bleeding' edge of technology."
1,The book is out of date. It has to be rewritten,"No software support, the contents are not comply with the technology. I couldn't get anything out of it. I found myself reading sample chapters from here and there."
4,"Good intro to XML, not so hot on XSL",I couldn't make much sense of XML until I read this book. It's well-written and easy to follow. Unfortunately the subject matter changes so quickly that the chapter on XSL is already woefully out of date and is based on a W3C working draft (WD) of early 1998. It bears little resemblance to the current WD or the XSL implemention in IE5. However its still one of the best and most current texts available.
4,Good Book for XML Programmers,"I recommend this book for everyone. There is clarity in the way it deals with fundamentals and at the same time gives you depth. I do agree that XSL has changed, but this sure is worth adding to your library"
4,(an aside for XSL users and a resource),">>Good Intro to XML, >>But don't buy if your interested in XSL.XSL is still a draft standard, and Microsoft's implementation is not strictly compliant with the more recent releases of the draft. Writing usable XSL is a nontrivial task (eg. for a large website dynamically generated from streams of XML data).The author of this book maintains an XML website (updates it daily, even) called Cafe con Leche. http://metalab.unc.edu/xml/As for the book, I flipped through it and put it back on the shelf -- XML is still embryonic and seems most usable for EDI, information management, and forcing office software goliaths to use (naively) parseable file formats. XML for the web is unlikely to be useful until better client-side XSL processing can be implemented.Since the book wasn't bad, just ordinary, I gave it the average (4 stars). I had no opinion on it."
4,Memory stick PRO,"Works very well. Unfortunately, not for what I intended as I hadn't realised there is a diference between the Pro and Duo cards."
1,WATCHOUT!!,"4GB would not work on PDAs nor digital cameras. Thought it was defective. Tried to contact ANTONLINE several times. ANTONLINE is Okay if products they sell works. If does not work, GOOD LUCK! Once contacted, they suggested I sell it. Imagine that!"
5,a must see!,"I agree with the fact that this film was not a box-office blockbuster but it was just as well because when I saw it the theater was not filled which is the way I like it. In any case, I bought the DVD and watch it over and over. Duvall's singing was a surprise, not as good as Sissy Spacek's in Coal Miner's Daughter, but good enough for a small Texas bar. Another movie that I compare this to was Murphy's Romance with Sally Field and James Garner (Garner was nominated for an Oscar, I believe, the same year as Harrison Ford in Witness and William Hurt in Kiss of the Spider Woman.) This film has a sort of switched-roll theme on Tender Mercies with Sally Field as the down-on-her-luck woman who meets a stable, older man. Also a fantastic film as far as it's character study. See both if you can."
5,DVD,Item arrived as promised with no damage. My Husband loves any Robert Duvall movies so I know he will also like this one. Keep up the good work!!!!
4,Good service,GOOD SERVICE. ARRIVED ON TIME. PERSON KEPT ALL ASSURANCES AND PROMISES. GOOD QUALITY. GOOD SERVICE. CD WAS IN QUALITY CONDITION AND I AM TOLD (WAS GIFT) THAT IS PLAYING WELL.
1,Beware: not Dolby Surround but mono!,"Although advertised and even marked on the box as Dolby Sourround 2.0 the only audio track on this DVD is Dolby Digital 1.0 MONO! And a bad monaural sound at that. There are no subtitles or any extras at all, either. The picture seriously lacks detail and sharpness. All this is a crying shame because the film is a masterpiece, truly Robert Duvall's labor of love. He actually sang most of the songs, too (too bad this DVD is in mono!) and deservedly won the Academy Award for his performance. As great as the movie is (if you like country music), the only good thing about the DVD edition is that the transfer is anamorphic."
5,Tender Mercies,"Excellent movie, Mr. Duvall did his own singing in the film an love the song Over you that was played in it."
1,THEY SPOKE FRENCH!!!!!! INSTEAD OF ENGLISH ON THE DVD!!!!,THE DVD WAS IN FRENCH!!!!!I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AND NOW I'M STUCK WITH SOMETHING I REALLY WANTED AND NEVER EXPECTED IT TO BE IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.CAN AMAZON DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?????
2,Tender Mercies,Didn't care much for the plot. I think Duvall was sort of mis-cast in that kind of movie but obviously I am far from being an authority on the subject
5,Tender Mercies,"Robert Duvall and a superd cast of actors bring Texan, Horton Foote's western ""passion play"" to life in a sensitive protrayal of private lives and the demons that often accompany success in the country-western music arena. Duval plays Max Sledge a legendary CW singer-song writer and hit bottom alcoholic who decides to leave the music for a painful dry out recovery and start-over life. A stark Caravagio potrayal of painfully poor choices and ripple effect consequences in the life journey of author Horton Foote's characters. Excellence in characterization and portrayal, entertaining and thought provoking."
5,Subtle with Upper-case Letters,"Each reviewer has mentioned just how ""joined"" each scene is, and how subtle the various messages of each of these scenes are. So SUBTLE, in fact, that no one -- to my knowledge -- has ever noticed the subtlety in the second-to-last scene wherein Robert Duvall is hoeing the garden, reflecting (with a fair amount of frustration) about God's intentions. Pay close attention to Tess Harper. If you still haven't figured it out, email me at wholeben@niu.edu and I'll clue you in. It suggests that a scene was cut from the final edit that might satisfy anyone who had wished for closure in this excellent movie about humanity."
5,Tender Mercies,"A genuine sleeper! Robert Duvall's performance is impeccable as Mac. A great supporting cast. A small classic. Genuine ""Must See"""
5,healing and evocative,"Mack Sledge is a former country music star, now living in a bottle, who rocks up at a Texas Motel, owned by Tess Harper. When he emerges from his cabin two days later, fresh from a drunken stupor, he realises that the friend who came with him has left him there with no money, and with a bill to pay. This is the story of how earning his keep at the Motel gives him the chance to earn some self respect, and to receive acceptance. His relationship with Harper's son, Sonny (Allan J. Hubbard) is an allegory for him being forgiven past mistakes, as it seems that he is the judge of this man's worthiness. Wonderfully evocative of an old country world. Robert Duvall is a revelation as a singer, and Betty Buckley is a vocal powerhouse as Mack's ex-wife.Take the time to relax with this film."
3,It's OK,"As always, Robert Duvall gives an amazing performance. This movie was interesting enough, but I felt the ending was kind of abrupt and left the viewer hanging a bit."
3,"hopefully, very funny","I know I am naughty, I have not read the book yet. I would like to buy a copy but with the TOTAL price in american dollars plus freight,I would first like to know whether it contains ""Last night I saw upon the stair, a little man who was not there, he wasn't there again tonight, gee whiz I wish he'd go away"" and ""I thought I saw a tiger alighting from a bus, I looked again and saw it was a hippopotamus"" etc. Can you help?"
2,Lacks indices of titles or first lines.,"This book seems to contain all of Ogden Nash's best verses. But good luck finding them: there is no index of titles or first lines. With so many verses, many of them titled counter-intuitively, you will only find the verse you seek by sheer luck, if at all."
2,This large poetry collection has no index.,"This large book contains hundreds of Nash's brilliant poems, but somebody seems to have removed the index, making the book useless. I sent it back"
5,One word.. Great,"I can't remember how I found this guy, but he is a riot. You cannot help but smiling when you read his stuff. The tounge in cheek verses, the wordplay, it is all so original and funny. I wanted to bookmark so many poems and underline so much that rechecking out again and again the library copy wasn't going to work anymore. Buying this book is like buying a smile for the rest of your life."
5,Pump hand sprayer,"Thanks Amazon. The parts arrived ASAP. They fit to a ""T"". The fast ship and the perfect fit and the sprayer was back in use in a few day. We were spraying apple trees every ten day. We did not have to alter our spraying cycle."
3,Review,Amazon was great for locating this game that someone I knew wanted... to bad the person was not worth the hassle
4,Thoroughly enjoyable!! =),"I've completed this game 3 times, with 3 different endings. Still trying for the last ending. It's quite addictive! The only thing I don't like about it is Hewie. The dog is just so damn whiny. And he always strays, then HOWLS because you're not there with him or he can't find you. I just couldn't get him to keep up and he's a dog for pete's sake! LOL...it's puzzling how I still managed to get an A rating for relationship with the silly dog as a result."
4,My daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarling.,"I love Capcom, always have.The premise of the game is a bit sketchy thats to be admitted but the boogeymen of the piece are sheer terrors.The first stalker, a big dum pudding that just wants to molest you then eat you, avoid at all costs. The second is a lady puppet type thing that goes off the rails and cackles wildly while wielding a piece of glass at you, after those two you have the various incarnations of monks each trying to steal your Azoth, as much as I could make out that was some life essence that kept them immortal.While it was somewhat hard to make out plot at times I enjoyed the mangled castle and its rooms of torture equipment etc.Some atmospheric soundtracks make this one a winner.I know story can be all important - but you get a dog to set on people! Come on! That's gotta be worth it!"
1,"Boring, Annoying and Leave the Dog Alone!","This game is lacking in scare but high on annoyance. The chase seems scary during the first couple chases but then it's so repetitive that it's just annoying. You get into a hiding spot and get a ""Coast Clear"" message and the villian is on the other side of the door, hears you and starts chasing all over again. The puzzles were simplistic and this title just falls flat. If you would like some real frightening games, try the Fatal Frame series and pass this one over.If you are a dog lover be wary of this title. You rescue a precious white dog and he becomes your protector. You can feed him, call him, praise him and you grow attached to him. He's the star of this game. Now you get to watch as villain after villain kicks him into walls, throws him around, and hurts him. You get to listen to his lifelike yelps and puppy whines. It's horrible. I couldn't take it. He's the most lifelike dog I've come across in video games and this was too much animal cruelty."
3,Good game with a decent storyline!,This is a good game for those who like the Resident Evil type of gameplay with puzzles to solve. I still enjoy playing this game and I would certainly recommend it to people looking for a good game. Gameplay is good and the graphs look good. A few things I don't like though are that the Hewie sometimes doesn't obey your commands and you have to get close to him to get it to do what you what and Fiona's boobs don't look real. They are too pointy and look stiff and giggle unnaturally when she stops running. Other than this I like the game and I will keep it in my private collection for years to come.
4,Haunting round,"The game is really fun. It's got great graphics and it's quite scary. The bad guys can get annoying at times when they won't give you a chance to hide or get away and the panic mode is really bothersome. Hewie can also get in the way at the wrong times. It's realistic though and it makes you think. Overall this is an awesome game for any horror fan, you just have to be willing to have patience and have good trategies."
3,Didn't like it,"I had wanted a push mower for years. Thought it would be a great way to get some good exercise while also getting a nicely mowed yard. I was disappointed. Granted, my yard is not exactly pristine St Augustine (i.e. many weeds) but it did not cut as short as I needed it to and wasn't particularly easy to maneuver. It did assemble easily and wasn't difficult to clean but I didn't use it many times before I sold it."
4,Works Fine if You Aren't a Perfectionist,"This mower (like all push mowers) works fine if you don't have tough grass or patches of tough grass. Also, it cannot cut as low as an electric or gas mower. It also will come to a dead stop if it grabs a small branch while mowing, unlike it's powered counterparts. If you can live with these limitations, it sure is great not to have the noise and power cord of an electric or the smell and hassle of a gas. Otherwise you may want to pass on any manual mower.P.S. There is no grass catcher either so you have to be OK with leaving clippings on the lawn."
3,It'll do in a pinch,"I grew up in the 50s using ONLY a hand-pushed reel mower. I thought this one would be as good as those that I used to make a few bucks cutting lawns in those days. Not so.It's OK at best, and does not give the lawn a smooth, even cut. For that, I need to use either my electric or gas mower. And don't let the lawn go more than three days between cuttings, or the reel mower will just bog down and leave lots of scattered lengths sticking up throughout the lawn.The Scotts reel mower will do you if the grass is relatively low and you want to give your (small) lawn a quick trim. Otherwise, you're going to have to go with some man-made power."
3,Good for small level lawns,Cuts very well and not very hard to push at all. I've got a small lawn of fresh sod and this mower is perfect. Does not cut down tall weeds.
1,Poor quality,As stated by another reviewer the pinon gears in the wheels gave out in only one season. Our local repair shop said that Scotts will not provide replacements. We called Scotts directly and got them to send us the parts but when they give out again we will be looking for a new mower.
1,Not a good design,"I bought it recently but got dissapointed with it immediatley. Assembly is easy. Not very heavy but it requires incredible force for slightly longer grass. The angle of the push handle is not optimum and can not be adjusted. I am 5'4"" and found it extremely hard to push it. Had to return it after an hour of use. Realised it is not for me."
1,Not a Good Product,"This was difficult to put together, bad construction of stamped out parts. Does not cut good. Handle to high for average person, you need to be at least 6'tall to use. Not easy to use. I would not recommend it to the average person. I have returned mine."
4,Very good mower for smaller yards,"I have St. Augustine grass and this mower cuts it very well. If you are looking for a green alternative and your lawn isn't too large, this mower is a great option. Quick run down of the Pros and Cons:Pros:- good green alternative- wide cutting path- kind of fun to watch the cut grass fly from the mower- wide range of cutting heights- significantly quieter and lighter than mower with an engineCons:- slightly harder to push than self propelled mower (there is a reason they put engines on mowers)- doesn't cut all the way to the edges of the mower (wheels are in the way) You will still need a trimmer- sticks and wood chips will stop the mower in it's tracks. You will need to remove the stick/wood chip before moving forward"
2,Not a good replacement for the electric or gas mower,"I gave up my electric mower with great expectations of being more environmentally friendly. Based on my memories of mowing lawns as a teenager, I purchased the Scott's 2000 20 inch mower and used it twice. What a disappointment. This mower is a poor replica....it cannot cut thick, damp grass, nor tall grass. It's light weight causes the mower to jump on uneven ground and slide on damp grass, leaving an uneven cut. The cutting blades frequently jam from too much grass or from tiny twigs that other mowers break apart. The handle bar is wobbly even after being tightened as much as possible. This mower is not recommended for northwestern lawns. I'm replacing it with an electric mower."
4,"Works, BUT.......","First of all it took me about 20 minutes to put together. Ten of those minutes where trying to figure out the horrible instructions and finding the right size sockets. SO I tossed out the directions and had it together in the other 10 minutes..This does cut grass very well, but the biggest problem with this mower is that if your grass has put up seed stalks it will NOT CUT them. It rides right over tall stuff, pushing it over and NOT cutting it. Even in the lowest and highest wheel settings. So then you have to go back over these areas with a weed wacker and finish the job..Advantages: No gas, no fumes, no loud noise, much safer than a gas mower.Disadvantage: Does not cut tall/long seed stalks from grass."
4,"better yes, but not totally flawless","Love the idea of these things. It's MPG on gas is unrivaled, engine never fails to start, and your wife doesn't have to drive to the health club to get in top treadmill shape. Word to the wise: Not a good mothers day gift, you'll get slapped ! (especially when you ask her, ""Hey Honey, what do you do when your dishwasher stops working?...buy her a lawnmower !! Yak Yak Yak ! (slap) Seriously, the only flaw this thing has is, if you need to cut grass that has been let go, or has any depth to it, forget it..time to get the motorized mower back out."
3,ok for tiny little yards,"I love the idea of this mower - no gas, kinder to the grass, a more environmentally responsible choice. It is terrific for a tiny little yard and if used every few days. I cannot use this mower for my entire 1/4 acre (and I'm an athlete so I'm not afraid of a little physical workout) but I guess I just don't enjoy lawn mowing enough to attempt a morning of mowing with this reel mower. I use it on my front yard only. And if I let the grass go for longer than a week, it is too late and we have to have it done with a power mower. A terrific alternative for city folk and those suburbanites with very small plots of grass."
4,"Great mower, good work out","The mower works great, although you have to keep up with it. If the grass gets to long, it won't cut it. A great way to workout."
2,Bad factory adjustments,"I liked the whole idea of not paying for gasoline and not having to maintain a power mower. When this mower arrived, I found that the reel was adjusted so tight that it could not even be moved. The instructions said that it was properly adjusted by the factory. It wasn't and after considerable work on my part I managed to get it to work fairly well. It does take more effort to push this mower and I wouldn't advise someone to use it if they are not in good physical shape."
3,Works well as long as....,"This mower works great as long as you don't have crabgrass or willowy type weeds. I recently acquired a very challenging, very small lawn. I love that this mower is quiet and very environmentally friendly. I have literally talked on the phone while mowing. I love that!! However, it doesn't begin to touch the seed stems that my weeds and crabgrass send up. I have to go over the entire lawn with a weedeater. If your lawn is remotely healthy and not too large, I think you will love this mower, but if your situation is otherwise, you will find yourself frustrated."
5,Great Reel Mower,"I have used this mower three times on Zeon Zoysia. The mower did arrive with some damage to the left wheel shaft and cover; however, Scotts sent me the parts in a few days. I was not sure if it would work after reading the reviews but I can say it works great. One time a piece of wood mulch got caught in the blade but not a big issue. Pushing in my opinion is less effort than pushing the heavy engine push mower that I replaced. I have not used the bag yet, so I cannot comment on the bagging but I do not thing the grass being pushed to the left off the reel will pose a problem as others have stated. In short, I would buy it again. I have gotten some comment but mainly because people think it is more work than pushing the motorized mower. It might be more than a self propelled but if you are pushing a motor now this is easier on Zoysia. If you have 6 inch deep fescue, I don't think you would want to use a reel."
4,"Solid mower, gets the job done!","Incredibly easy to assemble, and easy to use. Took me 10 minutes to put it together and head out the door for mowing!I love the adjustable heights, which came in rather handy for trimming down grass around our back gate areas. It's pretty simple to use, though if you have an uneven lawn like we do, it requires a little more 'oomph' to get it around. Even with my bad back, this is fairly easy to push.The only two drawbacks to the reel mower are not having a way to edge the lawn, and not being able to tackle the longer grasses- so we'll be getting an electric trimmer/edger to finish that up. All in all, a great product! Definitely get the sharpening kit, as others have mentioned, to keep it running smoothly."
2,Does not work for all lawns,"I tried this product with the hope of zero-emissions lawn mowing. It does a great job on the grass, but when it comes to weeds (dandelions, for example), they just slip underneath and come right back up. After almost an hour of mowing and going over the same spot more than once, the lawn continued to look pretty rough. Finally, a neighbor offered to try her regular mower, and it took only 20 minutes to get a much cleaner cut.I will try an electric model next..."
3,Started well enough but now needs help.,"I bought this mower when I purchased my first house. I wanted to use a push mower for many of the reasons most people do these days. I have a small yeard, hate the noise and pollution of other mowers and thought it would help simplify lawn care. The first summer it worked well enough, although I always had go over the lawn two or three times to get all the blades of grass cut. There is a tendency for the wheels to push down a line of grass, making it hard for the mower to cut that line on the next pass. Last year I purchased a sharpening kit, but the kit did not work properly, making it hard for me to sharpen the blades. Right now, the mower seems to tear rather than cut the grass. This year, I am having the blades professionally sharpened, and if it doesn't solve the unevenness of the cut, I will replace this mower with an electric one."
2,Push Reel Mower Disappointment,"I bought the Scotts push reel mower to get some exercise - it sure succeeds in providing it. The quality of lawn cut is so poor that I have to go over the yard twice to get a decent cut. The lawn grass is generally cut, but much 'trash grass' seems to avoid being rolled into the cutter blades. I have had to adjust the blade clearance - not easy to do without stripping the bolts. The mower is also very susceptible to being jammed by twigs or mulch, which causes frequent interruptions. The low-quality handle grip deteriorated within three months of use. Overall, I regret the purchase."
4,Classic mower,"This is a first lawnmower for my husband and I. We bought it to mow the lawn of our new house. It takes my husband at least 30 minutes to mow the lawn, for about 35 yards. However if the grass gets a little too long then it takes 45 minutes to an hour. He likes it because it is a good work out for him and good for the environment. Something that we were not aware of initally is that this product doesn't come with a grass catcher. I ended up buying a grass catcher for this product on a seperate website because I couldn't find one for sale on Amazon. Something to note is that we were at Home Depot and saw this same mower with the grass catcher for $99.00. Probably would have purchased the mower there had I known it was such a good deal."
4,No Fuss,My Scott's mower has proved to be a good purchase so far. I've used it several times over the last few months and have enjoyed using it. I originally purchased it so I could have the kids cut the lawn without worrying about them having an accident with my power mower. They now prefer using the Scott's over the power because it's quicker and lighter to handle than the power. I enjoy it for the exercise I get and the ability to use it during early or late times without bothering my neighbors. My only concern for the future use is the durability of the mower handle. The wing nut screws seem to loosen after awhile and need a turn here and there-but so far no big problem. The other rule that I've read before is you can't let the lawn get too long and try to bull through it-you can but it won't look good. In conclusion-good product-wanted to buy an American made mower but they did not get the positive reviews this one did!
1,Came RUSTED!,we just got the package from UPS. we opened the box and found that the lower bar is rusted!!! :( it's wrapped in plastic and the rust is all over inside the package and the bar. i am so sad and disappointed. i can't rate if it works any good because now we have to spend more money and buys some rustolium. so we haven't put the mower together yet. i just hope it works super good. just wanted people to be aware of the rust problem. i'll give an update about how good it works/or not later. thanks for reading.
1,Put up cheap,"The handle snapped on me the first summer I bought this thing. The same thing happened with the last one I bought and I had to order a replacement part. Now I wrap everything in duct tape to give it extra strength, but I shouldn't have to. Not for this price. Customer beware."
5,Fantastic Mower!!!,"Bought this yesterday, and of course was discouraged by sales guy about purchasing.He said it would be really hard for the ladies to push around, HA, it's so easy to push.He then went into stories about how his grandpa had this kind of lawnmower and how hard it was to use.It glides really easily. Glad I didn't listen to him, it's AMAZING and the best $104 spent!And I live in Orlando, Florida with St. Augustine Grass.Just got tired of dealing with gas, oil, spark plugs, filters, and endlessly cranking the thingto work. Also no toxic fumes to breathe in and no gas smell all over your body.Excellent product!!!"
3,Not recommended for South Florida,I don't recommend the use of a push reel lawn mower in South Florida. The St Augustine grass is too tick for this type of mower. I've start using the mower in November and I was happy with the results. As soon as the weather changed and the grass has started growing faster mowing the lawn became difficult and inefficient.
2,"good mower but terrible quality, parts come off..","I bought this mower last season and was pretty happy with the way it cut grass initially. But towards the end of the season one of the rear wheels came off. I have never been able to put it back on (and I consider myself slightly handy..) and the second wheel is also coming apart. Like others have mentioned, the handle becomes lose and comes off frequently, but that can be easily fixed and is not big of a deal. But the rear wheels, you cant use it w/o them."
4,Great for small lawns,"If you only have a small lawn, this push mower is for you. It's easy to assemble, good exercise to use, and does a good job (not excellent, but good)."
2,Think twice... I wish I could.,"Dreams are nice, but reality is a different story. I love the IDEA of this man-powered mower. The idea of quiet. The idea of no pollution. The idea of a good workout. Well, this mower delivers on all those things, but also something that I did not consider or want. Namely, the quality of the cut. This is a new mower with OLD technology. Picture the difference in quality between a letter printed on laser-jet vs. banged out on an old IBM typewriter. Basically, this 2009 mower does as a poor a job as the one I used 30+ years ago. You pretty much have to crisscross your lawn to get a decent cut it will still be uneven with LOTS of tall pieces poking through. So the workout is good, but the job takes MUCH longer than I wanted it to. And the result is tolerable, but not impressive.As for the mower itself, I'm generally impressed with the quality of the reel, wheels and lower body. But the handle, as mentioned in other reviews, is a joke. It reminds me of a wire hanger."
2,Sticky wheels,The problem with this mower is that the cutting blades do not turn easily. This results in a lot of skipping when you push it. The problem is compounded by the configuration of the junction of the blades and wheels which makes lubrication very difficult.
1,Very difficult to adjust,"This mower was wonderful when we first got it. When it sits for any amount of time, the blades become rusty and stiff. With time it became more and more difficult to push, requiring far more muscle than I have. Even after sharpening and adjusting, it works poorly. Scotts is also quite poor in their follow-up customer service. I've been on the phone with several Scotts people and no one can tell me where to take this thing to adjust it."
2,Hit and miss,I bought my mower in Spring of 2002. I was excited about the ability to adjust the cutting hight. The one major drawback I have run into with this mower is that it will leave a ridge of uncut grass. I even went and got the blades sharpened and that did not help. I typically have to go over area a couple of times to get an even look.
4,Prepare to be made fun of by the cable guy...,"I am an idealistic graduate student who moved to a residence where I'll be taking care of the lawn. So... I bought this reel mower. I quickly learned that I needed to re-mow half of my path after each pass such that each pass is basically mowed twice in order make the lawn look neat and tidy. Nevertheless, there were a lot of stray blades sticking up. I don't think I'll be purchasing the aftermarket grass catcher as the cut grass doesn't seem to be propelled very far behind the mower as it's being severed, which agrees with what I've read of other reviews. And, the grass has to be very dry otherwise it will stick to the whole works.However... it is good exercise and I feel good about using people power instead of petroleum to keep my monoculture carryover from a has-been royal society nice and neat. ""There's a lot easier ways to do that, you know,"" to quote the cable guy."
1,"promises much, delivers little","This mower is worthless. You'll want your money back just like I did. It has a flimsy,cheapjack handle and cuts about every third blade of grass that you go over. Your lawn will look like the worst haircut you've ever seen and that's after you have gone back over it several times. Also the after market grass catcher misses over half the grass tossed back to it.Stay away and try a lower end gas mower from Lowe's or Home Depot."
3,up for resale!,"I purchased this after reading the reviews, thinking it would be a great investment. I used it twice, the first time i thought, ok, now that I have it down give a few days and try it again. My lawn looks like hell! I had to go purchase a gas push mower!If you have an even, small yard, it's an awesome machine! otherwise, there's a lot of ""clean up"" to do after, ie. tall blades of grass it missed. My lawn has lots of patches from using this... ie. some places it worked great, others left tall grass!"
5,Foam Grip Installation Tip,"To easily install foam grips on metal tubing (lawnmowers, bicycles, etc.) first spray the tube with hairspray then slide on the grip. While wet the hairspray lubricates the grip, once dry the hairspray helps glue the grip on."
1,Not a good grass cutter,"1 week after purchasing the mower and after 4 uses the reel would not turn any more. Something was broken or the reel was in need of adjustment. After 2-3 hours of work adjusting the reel and still no rotation I sent the item back. There was something else wrong that could not be fixed by me. Besides, a mower in need of adjustment that soon isn't very practical."
1,Target and Scotts stink and refuse to stand behind their products!,"First of all, I had to spend hours tio put the lawn mower together! Then, when you try to use it, the screws come apart and the mower falls apart. I had to take it apart to return it to TARGET who then refused to take it back bec it was beyond their 90 day cut off, even though I had the receipt! Then I hjad to take it basck home. I called and complained to the Target Manager! He told me to call Scotts directly. They are never there. But today I got through. They refuse to even handle the complaint bec it is manufactured by John Deere and they told me to call them! Can you believe it??? Now I'm calling the TV Consumer Reporter. I am also going to sue them for my time. I charge $350.00 an hour as an attorney. We'll see if any of these people understand the meaning of customer service... Do yourself a favor and don't patronize Target or Scotts!"
2,You Can't Go Home Again ...,"I wanted desperately to love this mower. I remember my grandfather and several uncles had reel mowers that I would use as a child. There's something about a reel mower that brings us back to simpler times. Plus, no gasoline is needed, they're quiet, and you just might get some exercise.Then reality barges in: this reel mower just doesn't cut the lawn very well. Weeds or crabgrass do not get cut. As other reviewers have noted, you MUST have a perfect, weed-free lawn or you will likely be disappointed. Plus, I was surprised at how LOUD the mower is. The ""shearing"" sound it makes is at least as loud as an electric mower (which I now own).Also, take a moment to scroll to a June 4, 2002 review of this product titled ""A Metaphor For Socialism"" where the reviewer discusses his ""commie mower."" The review is hilarious (and I agree!).Bottom line: borrow a reel mower first if at all possible and give it a try. Based on my experience, you should be able to pick up a used one as well."
5,Amazing,"I bought this lawnmower used locally for a fifth of the new price. When I got home it was dark, but I wanted to test it out anyway. With just the light from my front porch, I walked straight through the middle of my yard and left a clear cut line behind me. It was so much fun, effortlessly mowing, silently, and without gas / electricity, that I just finished my whole front yard in 10 minutes. Why any other type of lawnmower was invented after this simple design is beyond me - this is absolutely perfect. The only maintenance I can foresee is that one day I might have to sharpen the blades. BIG DEAL!"
2,Less than pleased,"First - doesn't come with a grass catcher. Second, grass catcher they suggest and says fits this thing is about an inch too narrow - technically it fits, but not well. Third, even if it did fit, this design is horrible about projecting the grass into the catcher! Also the mower is really bad as far as ""getting everything"" - expect to either mow your lawn 2 or 3 times, else do the push, backup, push, backup and go method.One other thing I didn't think of, but this is more to do with the basic design - this type of mower is really bad at handling any curves.Nice to save the gas and not have to worry about cords, but I hate to rake more. I'm guessing this is why you never see a gardener using a push mower."
4,Scotts Lawn Mover,"Upon receiving had to immediately make a height adjustment other than the adjustments on the rear wheels and was not all that difficult. Removing the large wheels was straight forward. It performs wonderfully, and I like the extra width of the 20"" cut. So far (after a month of use) I am satisfied with this mower."
4,Excellent basic push mower,"I am pleased with the push mower I ordered through Amazon. As usual, the product arrived quickly and was very affordable. It is exactly what was expected - a very basic tool for small areas - quick and easy to use and maintain and a good investment for the purpose intended. As to mowing large lawns and such, this may not be a good choice for everyone, but for my purposes, it is perfect! And, this mower never breaks down, easy to store with no gas odors and such, it is quiet and doesn't need fuel other than elbow grease!"
3,"Nice mower, just not practical for me.","This is a great mower, well built, sturdy, and light. The only thing is that it is not made for yards with any type of weeds. Basically the images you see in the ads of nice even yards of perfect green grass is what this is made for. Anything more and you'll be frustrated. I have a small 1/3rd acre yard with some taller weeds. And even though the mower is very light with sharp blades, anything higher than the cross bar on front gets pushed down and skipped over. So great product, just didn't work for my type of yard."
1,Scotts Mower,Worst mistake I have ever made. It just does not cut the grass properly. It just pushes it over and cuts about 10%. Which I could return it.
3,Flimsy handle on an otherwise very trusty mower,"Love this mower except for the handle system. Mowing-wise it's really rather fun, although as others have pointed out, it won't get your tall thick weeds. I'm 5' and have no trouble pushing this around. Unfortunately the handle was flimsy from the beginning and finally succumbed to fatigue in the mower's second season, snapping off first on one side then on the other in two clean breaks."
3,Does Not Cut Every Type of Grass,"My lawn is less than perfect and is home to many types of grass. The Scotts 20-Inch Reel mower cuts upright flat blades of grass very well. However, it is unable to cut most of the tough wiry grasses. This mower would be great for smaller manicured lawns with flat bladed grass.I exchanged the Scotts 20-Inch Reel mower for a Black and Decker electric mower. Now all the grass and ground cover in my lawn gets cut."
5,scott handlawnmower,"I like this lawnmower very much, it is light, accurate, and does not make much noise, I recommend it to all."
3,Decent mower,"This item is great if you have a small lot, the ground is very smooth, there are not leaves or twigs on the lawn, and you maintain the grass on a weekly basis. I love this mower because it is quiet and it is very easy to use. However, it doesn't work as well when I let the grass get too long or if it runs into branches and leaves. I broke down and got a gas mower for the fall and to whip the lawn into shape so that I can use this reel mower during the spring and summer. I love mowing at 6am!!The handle feels a little flimsy and the foam padding on the handle has torn already."
4,Great mower.,"This is the first manual mower I ever used and I'm very happy with it. Lightweight and easy to push. Performs extremely well with ""normal"" grass. I bought mine used and will buy another one when/if it wears out.Pros:Extremely quietExtremely low maintenanceNo gas/oil fumesSafer than motorized mowersCons:Does not mow very well in tall or extremely thick grass"
2,No biggie,"I need a gas mower.I tried this mower, but a gas powered mower is so much easier. Not sure what type of grass this mower is suited for but I live in South Calif, and the grass on our lawn is a normal blade, but not a thick mat. Trying it out on a somewhat damp day, some of the grass just folded over. I did try and run over it three or four times, which helped, but kind of a pain...just wanted to get it over with quick.Even had a problem with the grass catcher that they shipped with it--kept falling off...the lowest setting on this mower wasn't low enough.Now I need to buy a gas powered mower...anyone want to buy mine?..."
2,Not bad--but not suited for all yards,"Probably better suited for a small lawn--particularly if you cut it regularly. If you neglect to cut your grass one week and let it grow tall, you will likely have a hard time cutting it with this mower. In addition, if your terrain is even slightly uneven, the wheels of this mower won't maintain contact with the ground. Since the blades are driven by the rotation of the wheels, the blades will stop or slow momentarily as the mower bounces up and down on uneven ground.I ended up returning this item and purchasing an electric mower instead. Still, this would not be a bad mower for some yards."
1,"Very, Very disappointed!",This was the worst push mower ever...I was never able to cut my grass with it...I thought it would be great because I don't have much grass...I live in a townhome. It only flatten the grass thats all....It was just taking up space in my basement...I finally donated it to Goodwill...buying this was nothing but a waste of my hard earned money...
2,not easy to use,"If you are a woman this thing requires a lot of arm force. This was 22 inches, I should have tried the 16 inches if that would have made it any easier. If you push this lawn mower forward, it does not move in a continuous motion, so I had to move this thing forward and then backwards to cut grass. You should definetly get a grass collection container for the back because too much grass will land on the already mowed lawn and it is not easy to pick up. the grass does not cut evenly, it could work for small lawns but I think my lawn was too large for this mower to handle, I was exhausted, when I mowed less than half of the lawn in one hour. I hope this helps anyone."
2,Dissappointed,"I was very excited in hearing a lot of great reviews. Unfortunately, I was mislead. My troubles with the Scotts Reel mower is that It did not come factory ready. My mower did not cut evenly, missed grass, hardly touched the taller weeds and not to mention the rickety handle. I remembered using a reel mower when I was like 12 and worked great!The coolest part of this mower and the only reason I gave it two stars is. For one you don't need gas. The other is you can mow and still hear people, music, birds or what have ya.This mower has been a huge disappointment, when I can go out and buy a new push mower for $50 more. Maybe I just got a bad model but overall I'm not happy and would not recommend this product to anyone. Thanks to all you people that have put youtube videos about the Scott's Reel Mower this has been very helpful to me. It's sounds like I'm not the only one with issues."
4,"Scotts 20"" Reel Lawn Mower","So far the product has performed well. As has been my experience with Amazon, the product shipped quickly."
2,Scotts 20-inch Push Reel Mower,"Bought this product when I got tired of our electric mower. My teenage sons have a lot of problems with it and mentioned that a neighbor stated that it looked as if a cow had chewed at our yard. Subsequent, mowing has gotten easier and better results, and the boys have developed more muscles. It was easy to put together and delivered quickly. Better for the environment and our health. But harder to manage and manuever than I had expected or remembered."
1,Not Practical,"We really tried to live green by buying this product, but there are several problems with it. First, it takes way too long to mow the lawn with this. Second, it's extremely hard to push this around, it just doesn't mow easily, it's a clunker. Third, you have to go over each section several times to get it even. Fourth, if you haven't given up and get done mowing, you then have to rake up all the grass clippings. I don't recommend it. We ended up buying an electrical mower. It's faster and easier. We also like the electric mower more than a gas powered mower because it's quieter and it doesn't use gas, two big pluses."
3,Great mower if all you are cutting is grass,"My lawn has a mixture of grass and weeds, some that grow quite tall and thick. The mower cuts the grass just fine but is really not designed to handle the tough tall weeds. It just doesn't give a nice clean cut. I want to love it but now I need to buy a more conventional gas mover to get a satisfying result."
1,Plastic Drive Gears Fail After One Season of Moderate Use.,"The drive gear from the wheel to the metal axle is made of plastic and the small contact area failed after first season and now the blades do not spin. We have a quarter acre of sparse lawn and we did not abuse the mower. Dear manufacturer, cutting weight & cutting cost does not necessarily equal cutting grass. ;) **Update: Manufacturer sent out replacement parts no charge. Note: I have since updated to different brand from same manufacturer with a cast iron wheel and pinion."
4,Great Product--But Be Prepared,"Lots of fun and very easy to use. It isn't whisper-quiet but much less noisy than a gas-belcher. I nearly lost my religion trying to get the handlegrip on. I tried the hairspray trick--it didn't work and only made my wife angry. I finally used some teflon lube spray and it went on smooth as anything. I've mowed the lawn 4 times with it since and haven't had any problems. BUT...... The closest you can cut next to an obstacle is about 3-4 inches, so get a good weed-eater."
2,poor quality control,"I searched all over to find a push reel lawn mower for our yard. This one was listed as their top of the line product on their website so I figured I would buy it through Amazon (best price). It came quickly enough, but since I got it it's been nothing but trouble. The manufacturer must have poor quality control because I had nicks in the handle framing, loose nuts on the parts that came preassembled from the factory, and worst of all it keeps losing the e-clip from the right side (the E-clip holds the handles onto the base). When I lost the first clip I figured I must not have put it on properly, but I carefully put them on afterwards and continued to lose two more before I went out and bought an o-ring to hold on the E-clip! Since then I've had no problems with it but jeesh, they could have drilled a cheap hole and included a carriage bolt, a couple of washers, and a wingnut for the amount of money I've spent on replacement parts."
4,GREAT,"LOVE THIS. It is not a power mower, so it does not cut as clean. But, it gets the job done without too much extra effort. You obviously have to push harder, and you will have to hit some areas twice. Also, you will want to mow weekly, whether you think you need to or not. I didn't do this and found out quickly that the two-week weeds were too high for this to cut. If you just want a reel mower that does it's job, this is a good one, and for a good price."
3,Works great until handle breaks,Pros-Excellent range in cutting lengths-relatively light weight-Wide cutting width-Easy to useCons-Design flaw- aluminum (not steel) handle will break within a couple of seasons due to stress where upper handle attaches to lower handle by the two screws. This design needs to be strengthened.-No Scotts customer service to address problem-One internet site to sell replacement part (Why would you repeat the cycle?).If this were a car it would be recalled for one glaring design flaw. Otherwise it's a great value for the money.
3,Buyer's remorse,"This mower should be really great, but it was a pretty big disappointment for me. It's well constructed, but it just doesn't cut the grass as well as other push mowers I've used before. I wish I had bought a cheaper push mower for $60-$70, or spend a little more and bought a cheap electric mower. If your willing to cut the grass frequently and don't mind a bit of a workout go ahead, but don't expect this push mowing experience to be the best use of your time and money"
3,My experience with REEL lawnmower,"The quality of the product is fine, but unless you are cutting your lawn twice a week, then it can't keep up. Very difficult to push through week old grass."
5,The Most Inexperienced Can Do This,"This is the first mower I have ever purchased. As a single mom who is mechanically challenged, I have to say this mower was great. It was so easy to put together. Anyone can do it. It is virtually maintenance free. I would recommend it for a small lawn around half-acre or less otherwise it might be too much work or take more time than you have to put into it. I enjoy working out and it is perfect for my 1/4 acre lawn. It cuts great. I followed the advice of another review here and used Pam to spray the foam grip for the handle bar. It slipped on like a charm. Excellent advice!"
2,Plastic!,"I've used this lawn mower for a little over a season. It worked okay the first season, but beware the plastic parts. It has a plastic pinion gear that just wore out. I'm hoping to get a new one. If it's replaceable, it will be very easy to replace, but it would also be frustrating to have to replace the pinion gear every season. It's also a little too wide to accomodate most of the grass catching baskets sold."
1,Poor Quality,"I couldn't even push this mower around the yard once because it kept jamming. The lawn was reasonably short and free of debris. When it jammed the blade would pop up and hit the handle causing the whole unit to come to a halt. It had to be returned because it was not useable. When it did cut it didn't do a very good job. It did seem to be a bit damaged from shipping so that may have been part of the problem. I ordered the American 18"" Reel Mower and I'm very happy with it. The American works great and is better quality."
3,"Eco-friendly, but an uneven cut. And raking the clippings is a pain.","Good thing we have a small yard and the neighbors don't mind if our lawn is less than perfect. I'm having to mow over the same area 4 times from different directions in a futile attempt to get an complete and even cut. The problem isn't dull blades since the mower is only a few months old.I'll futz with the adjusters the next time I use it and see if that helps. But even then I'll still have to rake up the clippings--there's no grass catcher, and I question whether the available aftermarket one would really be effective.I really like the concept of an old fashioned reel mower, but I was disappointed with the reality. The lawn would look much nicer and it would get done a lot quicker with an electric."
3,manual mower,"really doesn't cut very well. it works, but takes a lot of going over the same spot, to cut all the grass down to the same length. makes you want a powered mower. takes a long time to cut a small yard. what may make a difference too, is i have st. augustine grass. a tougher, lower laying grass, than marathon."
4,Saves on gas!,"This mower was extremely easy to put together and is very easy to operate. I like that it is not complicated at all and can be used by my 10 year old to help me mow our lawn. The one thing I do not like is that it does not cut some weeds that are prevalent in my lawn, such as dandelions. It just goes over them and will not cut them no matter how many times you go over them. But the fact that it is quiet, easy to push, uses no gas and was easy to put together does give it an advantage in my opinion. Another small drawback is that it does not cut a close edge as gas mowers do. But if you have a nice lawn with no weeds (or relatively few) it does a very good job. All in all, I am glad I made this purchase."
3,Does an adequate job,"Rather cheaply put together. I've had parts fall off, and the height adjustment settings frequently come loose. That being said, the thing is very easy to start and is pretty good exercise. Also fuel efficient."
2,it's ok,a friend bought this mower then found out it's made in china then the handle broke . then it ended up in the garbage
3,"Good Only ""Perfectly Flat"" Lawn","After using my Scotts Push Reel 4 or 5 time, I notice that blade's were not doing good as I hope. The blade's were still sharp but out of alignment, and kept on make my slightly bumpy lawn look like chop-chop haircut. I try and try to realign the blade's evenly, but it was impossible to show that much improvment. If your lawn is ""perfectly flat"" with no bumby area's at all, then buy this if you wish. If it is not, SAVE MONEY and stick to regular lawn mower. Also, taller person ""must have"" strong back muscle to push it's non-adjustable handle. Could have back ache next day!"
2,Not For Hills,"I'm not sure how I missed that important point, but I did. I don't see that clearly mentioned from scott's, either. This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills. It just doesn't have the leverage to cut the grass. So I'm back to the mower. One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces, but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push."
3,Good for specific situation,"This reel mower generally worked very well and is built very stout. But, I would not recommend this product for those who: 1) have lots of leaves, 2) have a very steep or unsmooth yard, or 3) do not mow in a timely manner. With longer grass the mower has a tendency to miss spots becasue the bend leaves can somehow slip under the reel. Otherwise, a very good functioning product that could work well for the right person."
4,Worth the Effort,"We've moved from an apartment last month into a house with a rather large backyard by 'burbs standards but decided to go with a reel lawnmower anyway despite the extra effort I might have to do and I'm glad I did. It's quite a forearm workout but cuts nicely and seems very sturdy. Assembly was super easy and I didn't have to deal with the soap-in-the-handle-bar mess other's have talked about since that part came preassembled. The major drawback, as other's have stated, is that it can't get too close to walls, fences, patios and leaves a bit of a gap that requires edging with a weedeater (so much for being completely gas-free).Glad I purchased it. We'll see how it holds up over time."
4,Classic Reel Mower,"The Classic Reel 20"" Mower is a must have for any home do-it-your-selfer.It is no harder to push than an standard mower and cuts evenly and beautifully.*There are only two down's to this product: 1. A weed-eater is a must, as the Reel Mower leaves a 4"" swath against the house or side walks. 2. To use this mower, one has to be a diligent worker. If the lawn gets too high (7""+) the mower will not cut, but only push the grass over."
2,Weak Handle,"Lasted for one season. The handle just broke on both sides where the two parts of the handle meet. Very low quality metal.Too narrow, though most are. I'd love to find one that's about 30 inches wide."
4,"The ""Green"" Way","Wow what a nice product! It is light weght and easy to use. I have a new house with a new lawn grown from bermuda sod. I do have to mow over some spots a few times before the grass is even, which is fine with me--I like the exercise. I do recomend buying a metal file to smooth the mowing blade just incase you mow over anything metal. When you hit metal objects the blade will stop and get slighly ""nicked"" which will cause the blade to click everytime the ""nick"" comes in contact with the cutter. Other than that slight inconvenience, the mower is great. No gas, no oil, no polution. It feels good to be nice to our earth."
2,Basically Junk,"I was hoping this would be a good option for saving on gas and getting some exercise, but although this mower accomplishes both those things, it does a really poor job of cutting grass. I have to mow over some places multiple times, and this mower WILL NOT CUT DOWN A DANDELION. I have to go back and pull all of those up by hand. It also jams really easily with just small (1/2"") pieces of bark or limbs. I gave it 2 stars because it always functions, and if something were to go wrong with my regular mower, I could use this one in a pinch. But as for saving fuel, it just isn't worth it. It takes me two hours to do my yard with this mower, whereas I can finish in an hour (or less) with my regular mower. An hour of my time is worth more than the $4 for a gallon of gas. I'll pay the $4 and save time and aggravation."
3,"the ""reel"" truth","Okay, bought and used my reel mower yesterday. It isn't that hard to push, even on the lowest setting. I am a pudgy 43 year old woman that never exercises and I had no problem on my first mow of the year. So no worries about strength needed to use this mower.Pros: green solution; no gasoline, electric charge, oil, spark plugs, etc. required. No planning required to buy gasoline or winterize the mower or worries that the mower won't start.Cons: doesn't mow the entire yard: some weeds just get mashed down instead of chopped; it doesnt' do anything to yard onions; it is hard to get close to fences. Also, assume I will have to sharpen the blades at some point.Verdict - it is an earth friendly solution to yard mowing if you are willing to accept an imperfect yard. I am a student of imperfect so I will continue to use this mower. I haven't decided what I will do about the edges yet."
2,Good only if you have a putting-green yard,"I so much wanted this lawn mower to work for us. We have an acre, with hills, and were even up for the work-out... but it's been a big disappointment. It only bends the crabgrass, weeds, and longer grass and doesn't cut it. you'll mow and it will look like you haven't. On a portion of our yard where we re-seeded last year and it's lush and green with no weeds, it worked fine, but otherwise it was terrible. We'd have to use gallons of weed killer - not so ""green"" - to be able to use this mower, and we're not going to do that. Back it goes. Bummer"
2,A mower that doesn't cut the grass,"I purchased this recently for a small lawn. But if the grass is even two inches high, the mower leaves uncut streaks requiring a second pass over these.Consumer Reports recently commented on this power and said to give it a pass as it doesn't do a good job of cutting the grass.I'm rather disappointed."
5,"Fabulous buy, wish I'd done it sooner!","Very easy to assemble, and I find it easy to use as well. There's something very satisfying about listening to the quiet rhythm of the blades whirring out blades of grass...It will be a workout for most people, especially if you let the grass go for over a week. It's a good idea to rake before your first mow; otherwise, you'll be stopping and starting every time you hit a twig that your power mower would've chewed up and spit out at high velocity!Enameled blades make cleanup and maintenance easy, and blades are very slow to dull. Couldn't be more pleased with this eco-friendly mower!"
2,Nice Idea But Disappointed :(,"I just tried one of these out after taking back an electric Black and Decker mower because the cord kept coming out and the cutting path did not meet the wheels like with regular mowers. Unfortunately this reel mower had the same problem except it cut even less grass. To make matters worse the right side of the reel was hardly making any cuts and the section that was cutting (about 60% mainly on the left side) missed a lot of grass even going over the grass several times.I can't believe manufacturers are not coming up with a non-gas engine design that actually works. I hate gas mowers, but after trying an electric and a reel, there is no choice in the matter unfortunately."
2,Missing Hardware in the Kit,"Cuts well, etc.; but was missing some Nyloc nuts from the hardware baggie so my dad went to the store to get more. After assembly it was fine. But who needs that added hassle?"
1,silly thing,"to heck with the enviroment,this will give you a heart attack if your lawn is bigger than 10 x 10 feet,im going back to gas fired and im getting a 24 hp zero turn,by the way there is no global warming.........and just sold the reel mower last week for 20 dollars at a garage sale."
1,This may be a good mower but...,"upon opening the box the VOC off-gassing was so intense, I just didn't want to deal with it. The box went back to Amazon."
1,Hard to Push,"I am 29 years old. I jog daily and weight lift. I regularly bench between 225-255 lbs. I HAVE TROUBLE PUSHING THIS THING AND IT GETS BOUND UP WHILE I AM FORCEFULLY PUSHING IT. I can just imagine what a person would go through if they bought this if they were older or not in tip top physical condition. By the way, this thing isn't quiet at all. Be prepared to mow your lawn 3 or 4 times before it cuts everything. I am personally selling my Scotts Reel Mower and buying a new gas mower."
3,Good and Bad,"This is the second summer of using the mower.Pros:-semi-portable- put it in my car all the time-never have to worry about gas-peaceful, ordor free-better exersize then normal-easy to clean the grass off of mower-easy to push-thick short grass(zoysia)Cons:-I have to mow my grass twice to cut everything-needs a immaculate yard - smallest items stops the blade(gives you a jolt)-handle pad is already deteriorating-too expensiveAlso, it seems like I need to do some adjusting or blade sharping because the blade is only cutting on one side so 10"" worth. I love the peace and quiet I get with this lawn mower, but I will go to an electric mower next time."
2,Not the mower for me....not sure who this is really for.,"I bought this mower because I wanted to do my share for the environment and not have to worry about oil and gasoline. In that respect, this mower fits my needs. However, it fails in one minor aspect. The MOWING part of the push mower. It does a horrible job mowing the yard. I admit I don't always mow once a week, sometimes it gets stretched out to once every two weeks on a busy couple weeks. If that happens every row will require three or four passes before it is done. If any weeds pop up you can forget out mowing them down. All you do is knock them over, only to have them pop up after you have passed them by. I am going to use this mower for the rest of the summer and try to get my money's worth. Next spring I will have to break down and buy a gas powered mower."
4,Generally a Good Mower,"The mower itself is excellent. However, the handle twists excessively.If, for example, you try to lift just one wheel to avoid an obstacle by lifting upward on one side of the handle grip, the whole handle twists so excessively it appears that damage might result. My old push mower hadno similar tendency at all. The mower works just fine if you give up onthis type of behavior toward the handle. I note also that the reel ispowered by a geared mechanism in the wheel hubs. The gears are some typeof plastic. This may become an issue with heavy use, but that is purely a guess on my part. Overall, I am pleased with how it operates. Nothing in this price range is built to last forever."
3,"light weight, and cuts well as long as the grass isn't too long","As other reviewers have said, it does the job. It's more work to push, but who couldn't use a little exercise? My only disappointment is that it's range to cut grass isn't enough, so those times when it rains and your grass grows too fast to keep on top of it means you need to have a 2nd one to cut the grass or pay someone else to do it.Really don't like maintaining two things."
3,Worked well on certain types of grass,"For the majority of my grass, this product worked very well. However, there are certain types of grass(probably just weeds) which it simply would not cut(This grass was just as tall as the grass it was cutting without problem). I tried pushing harder to make the rotors spin faster, but to no avail. It was very light and easy to push(so easy that my mother, who has osteoporosis and arthritis, could push it), but I can't just have half of the yard cut, so I had to return it."
3,"Pleased at first, but then it broke.","It's a good mower except for the handle. The handle is not well constructed. It's really flimsy and it literally just broke in it's second season.I'm in the market for an electric mower now, partly because I want an even cut."
3,Better than expected,"I have been pleasantly surprised with the performance of the Scotts Reel mower. It's my first experience with a manual mower and I was actually prepared for much worse.It is easy to push and mows very well in a straight line. My biggest complaint (and reason for only 3 out of 5 stars) is related edges. It is a 20"" wide mower but the mowing blades stop about 3-4 inches before the whee assembly and wheels. That makes close edging impossible. So, while ""going green"" was one reason for my purchase I will still need to buy an electric or gas powered trimmer to do what the Scotts mower cannot."
3,Not for my yard,"This sounded like a good idea to me and I read many of the reviews but it just doesn't work very well on my lawn. I have too many weeds that this mower doesn't cut so instead of just being able to walk along I had to go over some places several times and then still ended up pulling some by hand. I think it would be a great mower for a small yard with an easy type of grass to cut. As a result, today I have ordered a gas mower."
3,"good when cutting short grass, but a pain with tall grass","we bought this when we moved into our new house where seemed like no one had taken care of the lawn after the purchase agreement was signed. It did not work at all because of the tall grass. It simply pushed them down without cutting any. We bought a gas mower right away to save the pain-(: However, we are keeping this one and use it sometime, it works fine when the grass is a little bit taller than what you wnat them to be, not as clear-cut as the gas mower though, but no noise at all, we can use it around the house when our baby is asleep."
3,Mower Needs a Flat Yard Free of Debris,"I bought this mower for what I thought would be the ""green"" thing to do and for simplicity - no gas, no oil, no power cord. The mower is great on flat yards with short grass. No amount of pushing will make it cut high grass, and if there are even the smallest twigs in the yard, the mower will jam. I have a yard with very mature trees that have lots of twigs falling daily from them. Twigs smaller than an eight of an inch in diameter stop the mower cold. Unfortunately, I had to return the mower because I could not push it three feet without hitting a small twig that would lodge in the blade forcing the mower to stop. I wish it had worked for my yard..."
2,More to be desired,I've had this mower for almost 4 months now. I'm really disappointed with the way it mows. The grass cutting was uneven. I'd have to make several passes to even it out. My biggest gripe is the 3+ inch space it leaves when cutting grass right on the edge of the house. Those that rated this well probably had a flat and even area to mow.
1,Very poorly manufactured,"When I connected the handle to the upper frame, it felt really loose and flimsy, no matter how tight I made the screws. I was fairly certain the frame would fall apart upon rigorous use, but, unfortunately, I never got the chance to find out as there were no holes to insert the screws to connect the upper frame to the lower frame. (Note: Amazon will pay for the return shipping, which is great since it's not Amazon's fault, getting my mail carrier to take a large, heavy box in his already full stroller is a little ridiculous, but it's that or take two buses and wait on a long line at the P.O.)"
3,Pros and Cons,"I'll keep it simple in an effort to help those who are undecided.Pros:- It's cheap and very low maintenance.- It's much quieter than a gas mower.- It's obviously far better for the environment.- You won't smell like gas fumes when you're done.- You'll be in better shape in no time...believe me.- It chews up a surprising amount of grass.Cons:- It gets stuck on sticks (just push the blade in reverse with your foot to quickly release sticks).- It's difficult to maneuver in tight spots.- It leaves tall grass and weeds standing, because it's not powerful enough to suck them in and chop them. They simply get pushed down, then spring back up.- You need to be in good shape, because it's a serious workout.Overall, it's worth it for the environmental benefits. But if you're someone who doesn't mow the lawn regularly, this machine probably won't work for you. Once the grass gets too high, it's too late to use this push reel mower to cut it. You need to be vigilant."
3,It depends...,"I can understand the frustrations of those who gave this product a single star and had various complaints about it. If you are used to a rotary mower that leaves the lawn evenly cut after one pass, it won't look the same after a single trip across the lawn with this mower. That's especially true if the grass has become long and if you have weeds that have developed stems (dandelions, plantain). But I still like my new little mower. It's quiet. It starts every time. It's economical and environmentally friendly. It's easy to maneuver. And it fits my small lawn space perfectly. I would buy it again."
3,"works well, and then again...","i recently bought the 16"" version. good things about it are its light and doesn't take up much space so its easy to store in the basement and bring outside when I need it. As far as cutting goes, it does a decent job on short grass and its pretty easy to push. bad things: doesn't cut longer grass well at all. the longer grass gets wound up on the blades and you really need to go over the same spot many times. and anything wider than a blade of grass, i.e. any weed-type growth, will not get cut at all. I actually have to go over those things with the weed wacker. so i guess if you start off with a small, perfect lawn and are willing to cut it really often, this is a good deal."
2,"Eco-friendly, but time consuming","I had made the change over to this mower to be a bit more eco friendly. Saw this at the Home Depot, and thought it would be worth a try.Essentially, you'll have to mow over the lawn (2) times to get it to look respectable. I mean, I want to help the environment, but I don't want to bake out in the sun. Going back to my gas mower."
4,Like it but screws loose,"I was cautioned against using a push mower by a few friends who said it would be too much effort to use one. Still, my desire for a low noise, environmental solution that may also help me exercise won out, and I'm glad. Very easy to use, cuts well. it is fast and easy and doesn't require the hassle of gas or a cord.The only issue I've seen is tht the wheels have come loose after @4 uses. I tightened them up upon noticing it but they loosened again the next time. I'll get out the little flyer that came with it to make sure I did it right/ask my brother-in-law to look (I am a semi-handy woman) and assume it is easily fixable. If not.. will contact Amazon or Scotts.I'd recommend it!"
4,"Scotts 20"" Mower","This push mower is easy to push works great! The cut is nice and even. Multiple passes ensure clippings are thoroughly mulched and there are no holidays. I don't even bother with a bagger as the trimmings are cut very fine and seem to disappear after a few passes. The cutting height adjustments are very handy. Depending on your lawn, I suggest a 7 day max span between mowings as the taller the grass, the tougher the push. No oil to change, to fuel to buy."
5,Tried and True,"We bought this mower about 5 years ago.... I have been lazy to have the blades sharpened (after this season, it will in fact be the first time!), but I routinely spray WD-40 or silicon spray on the blades to keep them moving. I even left it out on in the snow this last winter on accident, not realizing I had left it out there!! But...it still works like a charm! Tall, thick blades do pose a problem for the mower, but if I'm good about cutting one a week (depending on grass growth), I almost always get a perfect job. And considering it has never had a piece break-off (other than the foam handle-cover coming apart on one corner...no big deal) and obviously no emissions, oil, or gasoline problems, I'd say a great bargain. And I've used it in two homes with rather large yards (1.5 hours max to do the job)."
4,Works great,"It is nice and quiet, and no harder to push than a gas powered mower. I find that I am loving that I can hose it off and spray some WD 40 and that is all the maintenance needed, well except for blade sharpening now and again. I am not the most mechanical of people so not having to deal with spark plugs, gas cans, and a pull cord that will throw out your back is a great way to get the yard done. It also takes up less space in the garage!"
1,More Work Than It's Worth,"We bought this mower last summer planning on taking a greener approach to our lawn. In the end, it is a total disappoint, and I'm in the market for a gas guzzler again. This mower doesn't cut anything that isn't the softest blade of grass, tiny sticks will stop it up, and it leaves the yard looking uneven (and basically unmowed). All in all, I'm pretty disappointed."
4,Good mower. Perfect for my lawn,"Easy assembly. Use plenty of dish soap or pam and handle goes on easily.10% on either side gets missed, but you just overlap to take care of that. No big deal.It's fun to mow with this.For those who say they want to mow at midnight or 4am, there are no lights on this mower, so visibility will be a problem.If you are a neurotic lawn person like my neighbors who like a pristine, ballpark perfect lawn, this is probably not the mower for you. If you enjoy having the high end riding mower to mow a lawn the size of a trailer, this is not the mower for you. If you enjoy walking around your lawn, not going deaf and coming inside covered with grass and smelling like a gas station, and if you don't lose any sleep if you miss a blade here and there, then you are probably a cool person and this is the mower for you."
2,"Mowed OK for a few times, then wheels fell apart- twice","We wanted a no-gas alternative. At first we loved this. It was quiet and cut the grass fairly well. We definitely had to cut more often, almost twice a week compared to once a week with a gas push mower. After about the 4th time mowing with this the back small wheels broke off. We got a replacement and after a few more times they broke off again. We finally borrowed a gas mower to finish the season. We're shopping for a gas mower now unfortunately. This one just didn't do the job, and it was pricey I felt."
4,Nice product,"This mower does a fine job on my small lawn. It's nice to avoid the noise, smell, and pollution of a power mower. It pushes easily and cuts well, although I do need to make a second pass over taller grass. I'm quite happy with the purchase and Amazon's shipment. The handle is a bit flimsy as others have noted."
4,Push Reel Mower,The reel mower was exactly what I wanted. I have some back problems and can't start a mower and most mowers are so large and cumbersome. This is light weight and I can lift it easily and it mows very well.
5,Best purchase in a very long time,"Despite the warnings that push reel mowers are for flat and manicured lawns, this thing is doing great on my rolling prairie. It's not hard to push, even uphill. Look at it as a productive aerobic exercise. I love it."
4,Cuts good but you will sweat,"If you are looking to get your heart rate up while cutting the grass, this'll work. It does a great job but is not that easy to push. I remember using this style of grass cutter when I was a kid and I don't remember having to push that hard. Also, if you aren't paying attention and assemble the handle wrong, the angle will be all wrong and you'll have to get in a weird position to make it work. People write about having to put dish soap on the foam handle grip before installing - mine came already installed on the handle. Assembly is very easy - I was cutting grass within 20 minutes. I'd give it five stars if it were a little easier to push.."
3,"Still, a good workout","For those of us who are looking for a good workout, this machine fits the bill. If you want a perfectly manicured lawn, I suggest using an electric or efficient gas mower. Of course, when I am cutting my yard, I always receive approving looks for my committment to a clean environment. Sometimes I can even see the people who are commenting approvingly, as they move among the clouds created by their gas guzzling lawn cutting behemoths.This is a nice ""feel good"" machine, but it's not difficult to see why the gas and electric mowers are preferred by my (fatter) out-of-shape neighbors."
2,Nice idea - not so great reality,"Nothing against push reel mowers, but when I finished mowing my lawn (took twice as long as a conventional mower) it still had tall grass sticking up in places all over. Why? Any tall grass or weed sticking up doesn't get mowed - the front of the mower pushes it down, so the blades never get a chance to touch it. Bottom line: quality of cut just isn't there, at least not for my lawn. However, if your lawn has perfectly uniform and short grass, then this lawnmower will probably be a nice experience."
4,Better Than An Exercise Machine!,"I purchased this little jewel in May, and tried it out a couple days later. I was very disappointed that it wont cut the blasted Bahia grass that seems to spring up 2 feet overnight.So I hadn't touched it again until today. I thought there was no use letting it just sit there, and since I have company coming Wednesday I decided to give it another try.I'm a 68 year old great-grandmother who likes to stay active by working in the yard, Long story short, I push-mowed my 1/2 acre yard in about an hour. the mower performs very well on regular grass. So I got the Weed Eater out and sliced down that pesky Bahia.Until I can afford a riding lawn mower, this one will be just fine."
2,Disappointed,"The mower looks great, but when I went to use it I was disappointed in its performance. It cuts the grass, but leaves all the tall dandelion weeds."
5,Best one yet,"This is the third brand of reel mower I buy in the past 6 years and it is absolutely the best. Light, easy to push, cuts all types of grass (weeds), and sturdy. I did have to switch the top handle around as I was too short (5'3) to take advantage of the ergonomics. My yard is a 1/4 acre with bumps and all kinds of grass and weeds & this mower is a joy to do the job. Plug in the tunes & go."
2,Changed mind after having for 1 year,"I previously rated this product highly. But, after owning it for awhile, I would not buy it again for several reasons. First, it clogs on every weed, tall piece of grass, damp grass, etc. So, you have to have a pristine lawn to make this thing work well. It is horribly difficult to push when you get on hills or if you have to do edges.I ended up getting a honda gas powered mowed and my life has been much easier. While I wanted to forego gas and be more green, this mower just isn't feasible unless you have a VERY small yard without any irregular patches of grass or weeds. Otherwise, this device will cause you to have intense frustration since mowing will take twice as long and require much more strength (i.e. I have blistered hands and tired muscles).If you want to be green, recycle, donate to charity, preserve green spaces, etc. But, don't buy this mower. It will be less environmentally friendly since you will have a wasted piece of equipment."
5,Throw Away Your Gas Mower,This is a nice mower. It cuts the grass effortlessly with a clean cut.My gas mower on the other hand seems to scalp the grass with an uneven cut causing trauma that causes it to dry out and loose moisture near the cut.This reel mower can be push along effortlessly and does a great job. No gas needed and is clean for the environment and with no noise. You can cut grass early Sunday morning without waking up the neighbors.It does not cut tall weeds.
4,Excellent buy,"I bought this several months ago when it was a Lightning Deal so I wanted to give it some use before reading a review. I had been looking for a manual reel mower for awhile so I jumped on the deal. I'm glad I did. There's no oil to buy and change, and there's no gas to buy. When I got the mower, the instructions said the blades were adjusted from the factory but mine weren't adjusted well enough to cut evenly. This is only a minor problem though since the adjustment instructions are clear and very easy to understand. The mower is a little harder to push than a regular, non-self-propelled mower but that's why they call it yard WORK. Anybody who wants something easier should just buy a riding mower or get the neighbour kid to do it. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it's made in China and the handle is a bit flimsy."
5,Great tool all year round,"I've used the Scotts 20-Inch Reel Lawn Mower to mow my 1/4 acre yard for almost two years now. I have not use any other mower. I am completely satisfied with this mower. It is extremely light and durable. Assembly was easy. Storage is easy. I cannot recommend this mower enough.That said, there are a couple of problems. This mower, like any reel mower, will not chop up thick twigs, so thick twigs cause it to jam and you have to reach down to throw out the twig. The blades are very difficult to sharpen. My local hardware store will not sharpen reel mower blades. Every five or six mows, I have to re-tighten some of the bolts, which can be done by hand in about a minute. It does not chop up leaves very well."
4,"Eco Friendly but Still, A Push","We bought this product because we wanted to free ourselves of a gas-powered mower and both save money and do less harm to the atmosphere. It's a fine product--well-made, appropriately priced. But at the same time, it has the drawbacks that I remember from push mowers of childhood: it requires that you almost inevitably have to go over the lawn a second time every time, and some sturdier shoots of grass and weeds (including dandelion stalks) won't EVER go down, requiring touch-ups by hand. For a small lawn it's a fine product, and on balance, doing small things like this to try to ensure the future of the environment, and thus ourselves, is well worth it"
2,Not effective,"* Rear wheel skids if height setting is at maximum. Cannot work well at this height* Easy to mow if you plan to do it every week....even a weeks slippage would cause some troubles when you do it the next time -- more resistance- both wheels skid or move very slow* Mower handle attachment is wobbly and doesnt seem stable* If your lawn is not flat then this will not work well* Not a good product to own if you want thick lawn growth but it will work well if you want to cut it down to the lowest size always.* Grassc achers are not sold in stores anymore you got to buy it online. The ones sold on Amazon dont fit this well. Its a 18in grass catcher so it will cause a lot of spillover.Advantages:no gas, no pollution, good work out - same reasons why i went for it but i returned it as the clippings dont collect well on the grass catcher. I would not be worried if the clippings were mulched or cut fine but that was not the case."
2,Too hard to push,"Not sure whay my issue is as all the reviews I read had little old ladies and pregnant women using this mower with ease. Maybe it is they type of grass we have in South Florida but this mower, unless I have very little (in terms of height) grass to mow, is a challenge to push. I raised the height and even added some WD40. Instructions state that you can losen the blades but it requires taking the unit apart, not for me. Went and got an electic (yes with cord) mower and am thrilled with the results."
3,Push Reel Mower aka The Exercise Machine,"I read several other reviews before purchasing this product and felt assured that this mower would be fairly easy to use. In truth, it is hard work and I would only recommend it for a small yard. If it took you more than 30 minutes to cut your grass with a gas powered mower, then I would not recommend this human powered mower. You will have to cut your grass in two to four passes to get a clean, complete cut. This is even stated in the owner's manual. On the upside it is inexpensive, easy to store, quieter, non-polluting, and provides a great cardio pumping work out. If your yard is medium sized or larger, I would recommend a rechargable battery powered mower. Better for the environment than a gas powered mower. Better for you than spending huge amounts of time ""working out"" in the yard."
4,It works!,"Wasn't sure about this one, especially since I have St. Augustine grass, but it cut right through it. We've had a great deal of rain lately and it even worked on the wet stuff. Wouldn't want it for a huge yard, and you do have to make a couple of passes to get an even cut, though. Overall, it cuts, you'll love the quiet, and you'll feel good about a small contribution to the environment."
1,broke in two months,"I bought the 16 inch Scotts and used it for two months. It cut great up until two months. It started skipping and just rolled without engagement with the blades. I have a small yard with hills so I try to push hard. Now get this, I returned it thinking it was just a lemon and got a new one. Guess what? Same result broke down in two months. Now I wish I had the own ones. Seems like inside the wheel is just cheap plastic parts. Problem is that I don't have much choice here on Maui, Hawaii."
3,Attractive but Limited,"As other reviews have detailed, this mower is not for you if your lawn is bumpy or filled with weeds. It simply will not cut well on surfaces like this. After struggling for a couple weeks with this, I bought an electric."
2,Doesn't get the job done.,"In a nutshell, this unit does not get the job done. If there were no such thing as a power (i.e., gas or electric) mower, and this was the only choice to do your lawn, then it would be much easier to let your property go wild. The unit doesn't cut longer grass, merely rolling over it; the grass snaps back into place. Further, heartier weed material does not get cut. So, save your $ and get yourself a power mower. If you don't like storing gas in the garage, which is my beef, think about an electric unit. There are some where you can charge a battery, so you don't need an extension cord. I have had mine for nearly three months and think it works well only on perfect lawns (i.e., with perfect grass and no weeds). That's my two cents, for whatever it's worth."
2,PUSH OR POWER?,"I PURCHASED THIS MOWER TO BE USED WHEN THE GRIDCRASH ARRIVES. TILL THEN, I'LL KEEP USING MY POWER MOWER. I TRIED IT OUT WHEN I FIRST GOT IT, AND IT DIDN'T IMPRESS ME AT ALL. ON SOME AREAS OF MY LAWN WHERE THE GRASS WAS A BIT HIGH, THIS MOWER JUST ROLLED OVER THE HIGH SPOTS WITHOUT MAKING A CUT. I HAD TO GO BACK AND FORTH MANY TIMES TO MAKE A CUT. AFTER THE GRIDCRASH, I'LL HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS. BUT UNTIL THEN, MY POWER MOWER WILL GET THE CALL. THE BIGGEST PLUS FOR IT......IT'S QUIET."
1,Don't Believe The Part About the 2 Year Warranty!!,"I was quite pleased with the way this mower worked for year 1. Just as that year ended, the handle broke. Much to my dismay, Amazon was not able to direct me to anyone who could fulfill the warranty on this mower. I spent a couple of hours over the course of two days trying to get some satisfaction, but none was forthcoming. I had hoped that they would at least reimburse me for Year Two of my useless mower's ownership!So, potential buyer, purchase at your own risk! Scott no longer makes these mowers and noone else is willing to procure a handle for it.I'm quite disappointed (for the first time ever) in Amazon's performance!"
2,Scotts push reel lawn mover,"I've read a lot of reviews on this product. I think most of them are prepared by the company that produces this product.This product is not designed for the purpose it supposed to be. The handle is not sturdy.You can use it for exercise purposes only. You can use it to move manicured lawns only, and even for those you have to go two-three times over the same place to leave clean.The only positive characteristic of it is that it is environmentally clean."
2,I wasted $99,"I REALLY wanted to like this and did ... at first. Problem is once summer got here and the St Augustine started growing fast it became WAY too difficult to mow over the thicker areas.I DO NOT recommend this for people with St Augustine lawns unless it's a VERY small area. BTW, I am a strong 190 lb man and it became impossible with even an average St Augustine lawn. Maybe it would be ok up north on a lawn with some thin, slow growing grass.I had to get a power mower and the reel mower now sits rusting in the shed."
1,It worked acceptably for a while,"I purchased this mower last summer to mow my roughly 40'x40' backyard. The mower did a respectable job for about a month, and then sheared the teeth off the drive gear on the right wheel. I continued to use the mower until this afternoon, when the left drive gear failed. Now when I push the mower forward, the reel doesn't spin. This mower may be acceptable for very light duty mowing, but the internal gears are made of soft plastic, and I managed to destroy both of them in about 4 months of use.Also, as others have noted, you must mow 1-2 times a week. If you let it go more than that, you will have to rent a gas mower to trim the grass, because the reel mower will not do the job."
3,Good for very small level yard,This is a very nice mower for a small level yard with no holes. I bought this for trim work and it works fine for that. But my front yard is 30 x 50 feet. It just does not cut it for that. I have a 5.5 hp reel mower front throw and it works great. The power of the motor keeps the blades spinning at a constant pace. The reel cut is so much nicer than others. Plus when your lawn is not real even it does a much better job since there are only two wheels on the ground. So if you have a mobile home by this. If you have a track house by a reel mower with a gas motor on it for the best cut ever. And don't worry about the environment with such a small motor. It is a moot point.
2,Scotts 2000-20-inch class push reel lawn mower,"It is heavy when pushing the wheel to cut grass. It will be stopped when it catches even a small piece of wood. The handle is wobbling and not sturdily built. It will not pick up clippings, as in some cases it is desirable to pick them up once a year. If you want a good hard workout, you want to buy it. I ended up buying a Sears gas lawnmower besides this.Not a good idea to go green in lawn mowing, maybe using a electric one.But it is too expensive."
1,Not good if grass is too long,"If your grass grows past a certain length this mower pushes it down leaving it to spring up once the mower is no longer over it. Also, if the grass is a seed stalk blade this mower does not cut it.Bought it, assembled it, tried mowing with it, it failed, disassembled it, and returned it for a refund.I recommend you avoid all the above."
4,Declutter your life by reducing lawn mower maintenance!,"From the reviews on here, you'd think the only reason to buy one of these would be to ""save the planet"". Personally, I think man-made climate change is bunk, and I love this mower. The mowing chore is so much more pleasant now. I can walk at a more normal pace when I push this mower as opposed to the slow pace my old gas mower would slog along. The lack of noise is delightful. My wife doesn't feel like she has to keep the kids inside as I mow.The biggest thing though is the lack of maintenance this requires compared to a gas powered mower. If you're anything like me and gas mowers come to your house to die, get one of these. This has made me stop looking at mowing as a drudgery and made it something just another chore.Just be aware that everyone you tell about this is going to think you're nuts. At least my friends did, but my mower won't break down any more unless I do, and that's worth it to me!"
3,Does not work for my lawn,"This mower presses hard on the ground to gain friction to turn the reel. Since my grass are fine and flimsy, I end up with strips of matted down grass on the wheel tracks. I fix it by raking up the grass or wait a couple days to allow it to spring it naturally, and cut it again. What a pain."
4,Very pleased....,"I purchased this reel mower for my smallish front yard to avoid the hassle of getting my power mower out of the shed out back. The reel mower stores easily in the garage and I can just grab it and go. I mow more often now because it is so quick. I have tiff 419 burmuda and it cuts it great. As others have stated, sticks, etc. will jam it, but easy to roll the blade back and remove. But for me that has been a rare event. I would not say it is hard to push, but uphill is noticeably more difficult. A bit of momentum helps. I kind of look at it as a bit of extra exercise. Assembly was very fast, just have to assemble the handle, no tools required, all wing nuts, 10 min tops. The rubber grip is now pre-installed no there are no hassles there either. I don't know why more people don't use these, not everything has to be powered. I still use a broom too. :)"
4,"Great, Fun Movie","I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun and it probably helped that my expectations were pretty low. I grew up in the town that hosted most of the downtown scenes - Mount Dora, FL (a correction to the previous reviewer indicating Fruitville was the filming location). They did film the scene of blowing up the overpass near Sarasota."
2,SWITCH TO DECAF,"This was o.k. Nothing more nothing less. This album was hard to review, beacuse no songs really stick out. I mean the guy is a mediocre artist with mediocre rhymes, laced over just above mediocre beats. I have heard better Sesame Street singalongs for yappy kids in the back seat of a mini van.I mean what does the album have that sticks out? ""Saturday To Saturday""? ""Bloody Horseshoe""? Or the multi- faceted ""Boo, We Ain't Forgot About You"" None of the above, or none on the album.Sorry. And please, all angry people who think that this is a bad review, remember, it's a REVIEW. I can say what I want."
5,hott,"this CD has hott beats, this guy is hardcore and hes much better than much of the rap today and i think that if he had an album deal he would ace this business. This guy has some tight songs and his music is off da hook"
4,A cut above the rest,"The best thing about this book is Walter's deep insight into the two main characters, and that's what kept me reading to the end despite a few bumps along the way. Too much space is devoted to the foibles of the FBI profilers, and I found myself skimming over those sections. (It's all been said before, in a lot of other crime books.) The switches into the point-of-view of minor characters, starting more than a third of the way into the book, were extremely jarring. I preferred to stick with Dupree and Mabry. Overall, though, this is an excellent book filled with vivid characters and intriguing plot twists."
3,Not his best,"This is Walter's first book. He gets better with each new novel. I think he is a very important new writer. This is a good (not great) read about the serial murder of prostitutes in Spokane, Washnington ( a town that has had a least two serial killers of prostitutes) ."
4,A good read,A good thriller. It will keep you turning the pages. The characters are well done. If you like murder mysteries you won't be disappointed with this book.
3,"Interesting, jaded, but interesting...","This book goes into the detail of the seasons between the championship years... If you are buying this book because of the allure to the 1996 championship season, DON'T buy it, there is ONE chapter on that Championship year... Huff's view of Labonte seems to be that Terry is a spoiled brat, only performs if the car is perfect, which is to say that anyone could drive it to a championship... I think if you can get past the negativity that is oozing you can still get some valuable information of the ""business"" of NASCAR racing. There are some very interesting points of what goes on ""behind the wall""..."
2,Repetitive,"This book illustrates the difficulty of writing an interesting book about an entire NASCAR season. The same material gets covered many times during different races. Reading about changing springs or adapting to front steering multiple times gets boring. Every element of the story is treated with the same depth - working with sponsors, the life of a crew member, factory support, adjusting suspensions, planning pit stops, driver attitude etc. all get equal attention.By default, the focus of this book is on the driver, not the pit crew, so a better title would be On the Track, rather than Behind the Wall."
2,So much potential...,"I bought this after hearing the title track on radio. I never quite warmed to the rest of it, but I still love the title track anytime, and it is a truly talented bunch for a change. For reference: I had hoped this band would be ""The Dandy Warhols meet Edie Brickell"" and it almost delivered, sort of. In fact, they not only met Edie, but also seemed to give a nod to Grace Slick, a hint of Cowboy Junkies, and, possibly, Neco from Velvet Underground. Leila Moss is a haunting vocalist, and at times, this work comes so close to ripping something delicate inside. But not quite.I give it a ""2"" 'cause you can't dance to it, and I didn't understand it."
4,Great Band!!,"a GOOD debut album!!! a saw them last year in NY, and i have to tell you that's so much better playing live!!!"
5,Something lasting,"The first time I heard the Duke Spirit was ""Wooden Hearts"" and I stopped in mid conversation and listened, This band has it all. Poetic lyric beautifully sung and a very tight music behind it. When was the last time you purchased a record and EVERY song was good and you listened to it six months later? This is something that one can keep on re-discovering.I saw them live two nights ago, and if you can do it - go. It was a very powerful performance where I felt on the verge of some sort of epiphany, bopping hard and smiling the whole time.Definitely my favorite new band for 2005-2006 and cannot wait to hear more of their new stuff."
1,Bass Man,This was a big disappointment. What happened to Stanley? And why is Duke co-signing this b.s.? Unbelievable how this piece of s*^t sounds. This is not jazz. This is commercial b.s.. Save your cash. Do not purchase.
1,provide a song list,"If you gave us some information about this release,like a song list, maybe someone will buy it and really review it."
3,Maps need A LOT of work,"Since I've been to Paris several times, I primarily bought this book to get updates on the restaurants and hotels around town. What we noticed is that the Frommer maps for these are HIGHLY inaccurate. In one case, we walked a half-hour to where a restaurant should be, based on the map, only to find out that it was actually over a mile away (and less than three blocks from where we'd started)!!!I'd highly suggest a different guide if this is what you'd be using it for."
4,A Panoramic Big Gulp,"Fantastic photography and sweeping history! Narrated wonderfully as well. The earlier history was most interesting. The background music was a definite plus. Didn't care too much for the more recent historic material, felt it was slanted to socialistic politics too much. Overall a triumph."
1,ABSOLUTE RIP-OFF,"This is a dreadful rendering. The presenter is nearly unintelligible with his mutterings and swallowings. My mother was a Scot and I have never heard such a lousy narration/presentation. Shame on the producers. If they conclude that such doggerel is acceptable, they need to have their hearing checked. Very sad, because the photography looks splendid. I will be returning this product for a refund. Embarrassing for a BBC production."
5,GREAT!!!,"I thought I knew a great deal about Scotland's history, but it turns out that I had quite a bit to learn. I chose to purchase this because I couldn't rent it through Netflix, and I'm so glad I did because this isn't going to be something I watch just once!! Neil Oliver clearly explains all historic events in a way that makes you want to listen to him again and again. The use of actors, makes history come alive here. Fantastic!"
5,It works wonderful!,I always dreamed home made latte with milk form but I don't know how.But This Milk Frother can do everything what I dreamed!!!!!!!!!
2,Worked the first few times for me...,"After seeing all the reviews, I decided to buy this item. It worked great the first few times and didn't do anything else. I thought it was the battery and changed it, still no froth. What a waste! When it worked it was awesome and fast. Now I have a piece of junk that spins but all it does is mix my milk. I'm not sure if it's because I'm using 2% fat milk warmed but if it's THAT finicky, I don't want it."
2,Stopped working,"This frother was great, at first. I used it a few times a week for a month or two. Then, I got pregnant and took a break from coffee. After my coffee aversion passed (about 4 months later), the frother didn't work. I tried switching the batteries, no luck. I'm disappointed. I feel like I wasted my money."
1,Not Working,"I have no idea whether this milk frother is as good as others claim since ours arrived not working. We tried replacing the batteries, but the thing wouldn't even turn on. We returned it and decided not to reorder given that it felt pretty junky for the price anyway."
2,"Great frother, but broke within a month of purchase","I purchased this frother because the ones from Ikea are too flaky and break within a few months. The finish and feel of this product is great. It worked very well. Unfortunately, it broke within a month of purchase, and that too with some pretty light use and no abuse - it was never mishandled. The device is fine physically but doesn't spin anymore - and the batteries are not the problem, it appears to be a contact problem with the battery casing. Pressing on the black plastic that holds the batteries gets it to work - sometimes.I was hoping to use this for a long time but it's obviously disappointing to see it break so quickly. I made it worse by not immediately returning it to Amazon and missing the 30 day return window :/If yours works well, you'll love it. I wish mine did."
3,Chrome is not as good quality as Original,"I was enticed to buy the Chrome version, rather than the original. It looked pretty and was a few bucks cheaper.But in my hand, the frother was less sturdy, and cheaper in quality. Maybe Aerolatte is using lower quality materials overall, or maybe it's just the chrome version.The quality of this was more akin to the IKEA milk frother. Product works well so far, but it feels like it will break sooner."
2,Not what it used to be,"This product used to have a heavy metal case with a precise-feeling motor, switch and bearing mechanism. Now the case is chrome-plated plastic and the stirrer rattles around in the housing. The switch has a very vague feel to it. Very cheaply made. Not too expensive but much lower quality than it used to be."
3,"Aerolatte Milk Frother, Chrome","I like the frother except the switch on it is rather poor. It's hard to make it function well, it stops and goes. Doesn't work well at all. Hard to make it move and to keep power to the unit. I have changed the batteries to be sure it could work. Needs a better switch system."
1,Stopped working after 2 months. Replaced batteries but no go.,Stopped working after 2 months. Replaced batteries but no go. Recommend purchasing another product. Recommend purchasing another product. Recommend looking elsewhere.
4,Good but moving up to the Stainless Steel one...plus HEADS UP,"I've been through two of these now (over quite some time) and really loved how they work. If you have anything other than milk (like cocoa - too thick) it didn't seem to have the strength.**HEADS UP** I noticed one day there was a little blue color in my milk froth. I couldn't figure it out, then realized the batteries were corroding from getting wet. This was really troubling, as I easily could have drank it, if I wasn't paying attention. I was afraid to buy another one, but I'm giving it another shot and moving on to the Stainless Steel one, which is supposed to have an even stronger motor."
4,It does the job!,We are enjoying it...easy to use and easy to keep clean. It's been fun to froth the milk and add a little cinnamon to our coffee
1,Two Frothers died after one month!,I liked this frother a lot at first-it works well but the first died after one month! Being addicted to my tea lattes I bought a second and it completley died after one month as well! I tried to contact the company and couldn't find a contact number. Amazon of course wouldn't take them back. Bummer they are not made to last apparently. I've tried others and they last longer but aren't as fast. Wish I could recommend one for you.
2,Stopped working within 3 weeks,Great product but stopped working completely after only 3 weeks. Replaced batteries initially and it worked intermittently and then stopped completely.Very bummed.
5,Great little device,"I love this frother! Instead of buying an espresso maker with all it's complexities, I just use my stovetop espresso maker and froth up some milk, and viola! I have a great cappuccino! It even does a great job frothing up soy milk. I highly recommend this device."
2,I have had better,"I had already bought a milk frother, but needed a new one and decided to try this model. It vibrates too much and it is not as efficient as the more expensive aerolatte I had bought before."
5,"Starbucks, take that!",I love my milk frother-now I can make a cappuchino for myself every morning! It makes great foam but it is also a great little immersion blender when making a small batch of salad dressing!
1,I would like it if I received one that works!,"Too bad! I was really looking forward to using the frother. I tried replacing the batteries, to no avail. Was I sent a defective product? Will the retailer replace it with one that works? So far, no answers to these questions."
1,The worst product I have ever owned,I bought this product because of the reviews.......would not buy it again. I have had it for about a month and has already stopped working. I would rather spend the extra money for a better product.
2,Worked Great for One Month,"This is a great gadget, but a disposable one. Whipped skim milk to a frothy consistency. But...it lasted exactly one month! Used daily, replaced batteries twice. Very disappointed"
1,Did not work at all,"I changed the batteries (even though they give you new ones), used fresh fatty milk, and followed the instructions on the placement of the frother in the cup. Nothing. I kept it running for so long and still nothing. It made little bubbles and that was it. Very frustrating, went with the aeroccino because I've witnessed it's amazing frothing ability from a family member. Definitely way more expensive than the aerolatte but i guess i am desperate for good homemade foam."
4,Wonderfully handy frother,"Love the Aerolatte Milk Frother, use it a couple of times a day. Handy, easy to clean, and came with the batteries."
1,Waste of money,"Can I offer less than 1/2 of a star. On Mr. Stohl's recent passing, I ordered the book to rekindle some memories. What a waste of money! One chapter consisted of a review of Pgh's Captain Jim - all 2 sentences of it! The claim was that no photos or information was available. Yet I found at least 3 pages worth on Google. If it weren't for the great picture of Knish on the cover, this wouldn't even rate 1/2 star."
5,fantastic accelerant for super glue,"One little squirt and your Super Glue, Crazy Glue or similar cyano methacrylate family of products sets instantly. No long holding and waiting times.NOTE...Not used to bond teeth in the mouth ha ha.I love itPhil Neal"
4,Great gift!,"I bought the films as a surprise Christmas gift for my husband, who loves unusual and ""quirky"" things. He was just thrilled. He has enjoyed all the films, but most particularly ""Powers of 10,"" which he plays for anyone who will sit still, including my 3 year old grandson. I wish I would have taken a picture of the 2 of them, seated in chairs in front of my computer, making appropriate sound effects and exaggerated faces. Priceless!"
1,Poor Quality,"Replaced worn stock strut with the Gabriel G55870 on my Acura. 7 months and only 7,000 miles later the strut already needs to be placed again. Poor quality and will not buy again."
3,C#.net Book,"The first chapter was excellent in this book. I am currently on chapter 7, but the gui details still go on and on....I really expected to see some more coding behind the controls in this book. The nice thing is that this book is that it discusses retrieving some data from a database."
2,Too Basic,"Well i dont like to write to much. So i will resume myself to the essencial. If you want to learn the langauge in its core, the way it works, classes, objects, the difficult stuff, like many woust to say...then i dont recomend this book in any way.Lets say that this books doesnt teach c#, it teach to do some programming with c#. It doesnt go further than the repetition statements, variables declarations, and the only database exemple you get uses databiding, in others words, wizards."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It's Dean Martin doing a Christmas album. Nothing here not to like. The sound is great. The selection is great. What are you waiting for? While you're at it, buy Christmas With The Rat Pack. Yep, there is some overlap, but besides Frank, you get to hear a few great tunes from Sammy. FYI, Sammy was Jewish, so don't expect to find a Christmas album by him...I wish he did one, but the afore mentioned album(cd) is a great one and the only place you find Sammy singing Christmas songs."
5,Dynamic Dino,Growing up with this LP and now available on CD. I could almost hear my parents singing in the background. What a wonderful Christmas CD this is to remember the past and make memories for the future.
5,The Art of the Spark,What a wonderful book for inspiring romance in relationships. My husband and I have enjoyed reading through it and delighting in the author's wise and often humorous suggestions for keeping love alive and fun. Now that we know what a romantic adventure is - there's no turning back!
1,one time mixer,"I'm so glad I didn't get rid of my old mixer. This product burnt out in the middle of me making cheese cake over the holidays and that was my first time using it. I would not recommend this product to anybody, not even my enemies."
4,mattress protector,"It is nice, worked good. received in good time. It fit the cradle mattress good. It was just has it was described."
5,An excellent soundtrack!,every song from this game is included here my favorite is Sgt Clemets Theme. another added bonus a DVD with intros of the Superstar version of the RR Divas. If you are a huge fan of this game you'll love this soundtrack
5,RUSTY TRUCK needs NO Oil,"This band is a well lubricated machine!! I was watching Don Imus last week on MSNBC and during his cut out for a commercial, he played some segments from this CD. I thought it was literally AMAZING and ordered it from Amazon. I first tried to find it locally in about 4 different music stores but had no luck. Mark Seliger does the lead vocals and he sounds great. I'm not sure how to categorize this CD but it could be considered bluesy country if there is such a thing! Regardless, I can't stop listening to it! It's definitely one of those rare masterpieces you just can't get enough of. Alot of music stars contributed to this CD, including Sheryl Crow, Willie Nelson, and Lenny Kravitz. The collaboration is amazing!! Don't hesitate to buy this baby! One of the BEST CD's I've purchased in a long time!!! My only question is.....when is the second CD gonna be released?"
5,Great Country/Folk music,"What a joy this music is. The lead singer is terrific, the backup vocals are as well, and the lyrics stay with you, even if you are a 50-something. Thank you!! Waiting for more."
5,Great Modern Country Album,"I heard Rusty Truck on Imus and quickly bought the CD. It did not disappoint -- clever lyrics, catchy tunes, and excellent musicianship."
3,Works OK,"This tip will create a fine flat spray. If you use this in ANY wind, you will get overspray so be careful. ALSO, this tip DOES NOT come with the rubber o-ring needed to secure the tip so you'll have to make sure you have the other one in the sprayer or but the replacement kit. That kit will come with only ONE of theses miniature o-rings which is a shame."
5,Growing Up Cuban in Decatur GA,"This book on tape was the best one that I have ever listened to! The content, stories of the author's childhood, were emotionally captivating. There are areas that every single person can relate to - funny, sad, inspiring and enlightening. Ms Deedy's tales brought me back to my childhood (growing up in a large Italian family in a small town).This is a great car tape, because the stories are all individual and relatively brief, making it easy to 'pop' the tape in for great entertainment!"
3,Sweetened with High Fructose Corn Syrup,"This energy drink tastes great, but I can't believe I made the assumption since it's advertised as a natural herbal supplement that I overlooked the high fructose corn syrup!"
5,adorable,"The stingray is incredibly soft and smooth and is reminiscent of the real thing. It is quite small and remarkably cute (you'll see what I mean, you can't help but smile at it). It's also funt o play catch with as the fins/wings help it glide through the air."
5,The Best of the Best from Elmore Leonard to Ron Howard,"If you can't make it to the Maui Writers conference (the Cannes of the literary world), here's the creme de la creme distilled into one book; if you're a writer, make this your new journal. From Elmore Leonard to Ron Howard to dozens of top names in fiction, non-fiction, screenwriting, the reader gets behind the art, the science and the magic of craft from masters. Explored in quick, easy to relate-to chapters by author, this book is inspiration for the pocket or bedside table -- read one piece each night before you dream, authors. A new must for any serious writer today."
1,Disappointed,"Though these boots are very warm, they LEAK! After the first snowfall my bf said one foot felt wet. We were in denial and decided his sock was wet before he put the boots on..but alas, both boots leak! Not sure from where, but we pulled the linings out to dry and the inside souls were sopping. Very disappointed since bf said they are comfy and warm, but don't stay warm once wet! They are also a little clunky when walking and he tended to scuff along in them. What a bummer of a Christmas gift :("
4,Happy Hubby,Finding something that my husband loves is very hard. These boots hit a home run this Christmas. He loves them. Got here fast and good quality.
4,Wrong product sent. Right product received with top off.,"The suplier didn't send the right product initially. They sent me a repellant rather than a killer.I did not want to send them to my neighbors.The second shipment was the right product, but the lid was off. All of the product was in the plastic envelopeand on all the extra documents. This is a hazardous product, which required throwing everething else awayand an extra cleaning of tools and hands.I would not ordere anything coming from Taylor Gifts."
4,not really sure,"had horrible mole/vole infestation. Professional exterminator was of no help, but that is another story. Used ""Patrol"" and critters appear to be gone. Have to be honest and say that I was trying a multitude of ""solutions"" at the same time and the weather turned to winter about the same time. Bottom line - critters are gone!"
1,"Killed My Wallet, Not My Critters","Have a few colonies of voles and chipmunks living with us. This was supposed to reduce or eliminate them, but they seem to know to avoid it or it just doesn't have any effect on them. Colonies still thrive and now laugh in my general direction. Oh well, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em."
5,Awesome,Wonderful product....already hatched 6 of 8 eggs on a trial run...I just can't say enough good about this thing.excellent incubator.
3,I dont get the hype...,"its very pretty, the fight sequences are very cool... its PRETTY. The story is extremely typical, very predictable, and unsatisfying. What is the hype? I'm just not seeing it.It was typical. Pretty, if you want to see a lot of cool fight scenes then by all means, but if you want some innovative beautiful creative story line, look elsewhere, this doesn't have it."
4,The anime version of Shinobi!,"This is by far one of my favorite series up to date along side the rebuild of Neo Genesis, Big O, and Noein. I actually saw the live movie version of Shinobi first a few years ago I believe and loved it! when I saw this for the first time I had no idea it was the same story essentially about the Kouga and Iga villages of fuedal Japan and the ancestral war they were engaged in. The series does it even more justice due to the length (26 episodes) and overall story and character development is more immersive. No spoilers here but I must say this is a MUST BUY! You like a great story, love, and war, you better buy this for sure. Really 4 1/2 stars easily!"
4,dog cleanser,This product cleansed my dog and helped her skin condition. It did not clear it up totally but it kept her from getting much worse.
5,"Basically, it rocks...","I used to be a DJ in a music station and my co-workers got a little sick of how much I played this album - any excuse, out it came. Stylistically it's the most eclectic mix of tracks I've ever heard - don't expect any two to be similar - it goes from trance to indie-pop to soul to the downright weird. For anyone who (like me) likes all these styles it's like your very own little mix tape. I've been dying to find a copy ever since I left the station - get it now or else you'll regret it!"
3,counting cards,"Counting cards is not so hard, the dealer shuffling all the time making couning worthlist ,makes it hard."
1,Mostly a rehash of existing material done better elsewhere,"This book has little to offer in terms of practical advice, and nothing to add to the theory of blackjack. The count systems outlined in the book are both more awkward to use and less powerful than other commercially available systems in their class. For new players this book is emphatically not a good starting point. Experienced players won't learn anything new.If you have read another blackjack book, about 85% of the content will be familiar to you. The rest is either just filler, or theoretical curiousity.My edition has some awful typos which would really cost you money if you didn't spot them. I think these were corrected later, but it does give you an indication of how sloppily this book was put together, especially when compared with the thorough editing that went into blackjack classics like ""Professional Blackjack"" and ""Blackjack Attack""."
3,O.K.,RECIEVED THE PRODUCT ;;; BUT IT IS NOT THE PART I WAS NEEDING !NEEDED A REPAIR KIT FOR HUDSON 4 GAL BAK-PAC SPRAYER .WRONG ITEM !
4,good kit,This kit contains all the rubber parts of just about every Hudson plastic bodied sprayer.Mine came back from the dead after I put the new rubber on the plunger and put in the replacement check valve .$12.00 including shipping instead of $30+ for a new sprayer.
5,great book!,"I bought this book for myself, I was happy with the condition and the time it took to get here. It was not as fast as some of the other items I bought at the same time but well before the end date. I would buy from them again."
4,Sweet and chewy - but I like their original caramel crumble better,"First off, let me say that I was looking for years for a more crumbly/hard kind of vanilla fudge, and after trying the varieties of Caramoo, it's actually not this one I was looking for, because this is a more classic vanilla caramel which is chewier and creamier. But many of you will like this one best: Tasty, high-quality vanilla caramel. Any fans of caramel or vanilla will enjoy it! I am going over to the original to proclaim my love for it."
1,"If you order this, your order will be canceled the next day","I'm not sure why this item is listed if you can't order it.I ordered the item, and a day later received an e-mail from Amazon saying my order would not be fulfilled. Thanks a lot, Amazon. Why not remove the item from your site, instead of leading people to believe they can order something that in fact they can't?!"
5,Quantumly quirky .. fun at many levels of spin and charm,Take a facile mind and let it play with the dichotomy between the quantum state and the macro universe - throw in a dash of Twain & Bierce and Darwin & Escher and you have Quantations. A slim book with many big ideas.Well worth the price and a fun read.
1,What? ...What?,"This book was recommended to me. Here are some quotations from Quantations, and my thoughts about them:""Only the incomprehensible is worth understanding.""[Me: I don't understand; oh, but now I do; hey, wait a second...]""All human experience is ordinary, not quantum. Whether our reliance on classical modes of perception is a permanent feature of the human condition remains to be seen.""[Me: Oh, you mean like, because we're not electrons?]""Death is simply the collapse of the superpositions we call ""life."" The ultimate decoherence.""[Me: I've seen loved ones die. This is both idiotic and insulting.]""Look at it in quantum light.""[Me: As contrasted with that non-quantum light?]""Matter is thought, and thought is matter.""[Me: Yeah... no, it's not.]Is this a joke? What a load of rubbish. People actually paid 21 bucks to read this drivel? This book is so full of hot air, it must float. I worry I may have lost a couple IQ points just reading the selections from the 'Look Inside' feature."
4,A review from a non-science fiction reader,"Sometimes friends give you books you wouldn't normally read - what a pleasure this one has been! Not a fan of science fiction, I began the book with trepidation. From the beginning, I found believable characters, an intriguing plot line and just the right amount of scientific information. A terrific start for a series, the end leaves you wanting more! I anxiously await the next book by this talented author!"
2,Keyword: distant,"With ambient wash-ups and sub-Tarentel phrasings may be soothing, but it's hardly moving."
5,Smokin!,"This hot platter of ...-whack is a must-have! This is one funky Indian dude here...The ""other"" brown-eyed soul. Throw in a little party effort a la' J.Geils, Jack Mack & the Heart Attack, and even The Fleshtones, with a whole lotta James Brown & His Famous Flames, and a gritty knowledge of the history of R&B, and you've got something really special here!"
5,Saeco Aroma,"Excellent espresso machine for the price. What it lacks in asthetic appearance is more than made up for it's capabilities. Learning curve may be a bit steep especially if you aren't/weren't a barista at one point in your life. But once you find the right beans, the right grind, the correct tamp, and how to froth milk properly, the Saeco Aroma delivers a consistently delicious--and beautiful (see my posted image)-- cup of coffee every single time."
2,Better for the total genealogy newbie,"This product is a real mixed bag. Some CDs, which is nice, but most of the data included is limited to a one year online subscription. The software is ok, but the search is buggy (too many names will cause it to bomb and automatically reboot your computer in an unsafe manner). And you can't import pics from from another piece of software - it's time consuming to fix all the bugs it creates if you're trying to convert from another piece of software. Also - I've not found much new data helpful to my tree - most of what I've run across I've already found for free on the internet. (...)"
2,"Home wine maker here, I couldn't read this book through...","This author probably knows here stuff. That being said, this book is dry dry dry. Make's a Chianti taste like sweet cool-aid. I picked up this book and started at the beginning. A few chapters in, had to lay it down as it was not helpful and I didn't feel like I was learning. And I'm pretty decent with science type stuff (how's that for smart sounding). I feel that she tries to explain technical points with a lot of fluff. It reminded me of an article I might write in college. I find the book wasn't good for reference because of that, too much fluff to get to the facts. For home brewers looking to learn, I would look elsewhere. For professionals, this probably isn't technical enough.Positives of this book as it has a really interesting cover and lots of other good reviews on here that got me to buy it."
5,"True, honest and thorough","A really good book for wine tasters, bringing all kinds of knowledge that is hard to encounter at wine tastings. Going through the most important topics & problems of modern winemaking technology, giving a scientific review of brettanomyces, the chemical composition of wine, wine & terroir, etc...A short handbook & reference manual on what we scientifically know about wine. Factual and fascinating. Really loved it, can look up any single chapter any time."
1,Garbage,"Terrible product, you need to spend minutes adjusting the back flap to make it stay up. Has non-standard RJ-11 connector for headset, low speaker volume, very slow UI. Stay away."
5,Tongue Fasting,"I found this book to be educational. I did read it straight through the first time, knowing that I will have to read it again on the day by day basis. I have yet to set aside days for tongue fasting but that's the human way with all diets/changes. This is another book I am glad I purchased.haf"
5,30 day to taming your tongue,This book is growing me in my walk with the Lord. And is changing who I am as a Parent.
1,I was duped!!!,"I would have never purchased this item if it had included anywhere in the description that it was religious propaganda. I didn't read the whole thing, all I saw was the statement that everything I have is because of God. If that's your world, OK, but I do not believe that garbage."
4,A Massive Collectors Piece for Chess Enthusiasts,"This massive volume of chess problems is a giant collector's piece. The bulk of the book is comprised of one, two and three move mate combination puzzles, but also included is a look into famous chess games played by many of the greatest players of all time. If one is able to get through the entire book and understand all the puzzles, my estimate is that you will be a formidable tournament player.The value of this book as a collector's piece is unquestionable; it is massive, it stands out on any bookshelf, and the content is considerable. You will only improve your game going through this book, and thus I recommend it to any chess player with an interest in expanding their chess library."
2,"Great for beginners, but...","I have to disagree with some of the previously posted reviews here. While this book is quite good for beginner/intermediate players (under 1700), it's really quite useless for more advanced players. Luckily, Laszlo Polgar has written two further books in the same format as this one for more advanced players. The titles are ""Chess Middlegames"" and ""Chess Endgames"", and both have over 4000 positions to play through. Moreover, the great majority of these positions are not one move solutions, but full-length (up to 30 moves) game continuations. The best way to learn chess is through pattern recognition, and Mr. Polgar has done a great job in his other books. I have yet to see this book on amazon.com, hope they have it soon. Until then, however, the only place to get it is at the chesstalk.com website. By the way, I'm a strong expert class player, so my comments are geared towards other players of similar strength."
2,Massive Monster - Some Good/Some Filler (real junk problems),"Instead of giving a more limited number of problems to solve with the most important tactical patterns, the author set out to do ""quantity instead of quality"" and becomes a ""compliler"" instead of a teacher directing a student to learn what is most important with perhaps a limited time to study like the average chess player.This mass compilation of problems contains a lot of junk filler along with some very nice important tactical themes to learn. So, the book refuses to show you what is important, and what should be tossed out with the garbage - the postions which would not likely occur in real games you would play.I would like a book with 100 to 500 of the MOST IMPORTANT TACTICAL THEMES TO LEARN. Not so many that you cannot tell what is important from filler to make a book so big."
5,The best song i have ever heard,"When i first heard this song i said to my self who is that tha is perfect i have never heard anything like that.It was not what got me in to the chili peppers because i did not know who it was. when i had found out it was them i was like so astonished. i had only heared the previeous stuff and this was not like that. I am only saying this so u know that i dont like this cause they are my favorite band.In fact as i am writing this review i am playing this song, ha ha ha. The guitar solo in the begining is so smoth and perfect. This song was what bosted the peppers into the main strem it is a great if you dont feel like getting blood sugar sex magic. I want every one to know that i have all the chili pepper albums but i do not like this just because i like them."
3,"Liked it, didn't love it","A short 250ish pages, it would have been better to have cut 100 pages and make this a short story without all of the unnecessary and meaningless character-developing diversions. The book runs along in 3rd gear most of the time, never really reaching a dramatic climax, which is really not good for a mystery, and the pretense is a little hard to believe: intrepid reporter for London tabloid gets everyone's help in solving murder mystery, even help from those who shouldn't be helping her. Certainly not the best mystery out there."
3,Disappointing,"Val McDermid is supposed to be sardonic but it sure doesn't show in this novel. It is competently written but how anyone could manage to care about any of the characters is difficult to imagine. Lindsay runs around with everyone spilling their guts to her for no particular reason and behaves at best stupidly when the pieces fall into place. Cordelia, her supposed lover, can't be bothered to cancel a few appointments (she's a FICTION writer for heaven's sake. What's so important she can't put it off?)when Lindsay is in obvious danger, and Deborah is at best a brainless twit who knowingly puts her young daughter in danger. They are all supposedly lesbians with the hots for each other, but it sure doesn't show. They all come across as about as passionate as Christie's Miss Marple.Considering McDermid's reputation as a writer, it is a seriously disappointing piece of work."
2,Hard to get through,"I just can't recommend this book because the writing style is very difficult to get into. I spent four months trying to slog through this novel, all the while putting it down and reading about six other books before finally finishing it. Maybe it's because the writer is British and I'm not, but I found it hard to keep track of what was going on, the political and social system where the story takes place, and the terminology or slang used. However, I can't help but think that a good writer would be able to spin a tale that would engross any reader, and this isn't the case here."
2,So what?,"This is the second novel I've read by Mr. Little. I read The Store four years ago and was disappointed by bland characters doing lots of stuff. The Revelation is certainly imaginative, but Gordon and crew are also featureless and rather boring. A story is pinned to characters, right? No matter how many giant fetuses rise from the soil, I didn't care about Gordon and Brother Elias. They have no grooves on which to pin a story. I did read a short story by Little entitled ""The Sanctuary"" a few months ago which was fantastic. Hit and miss, I suppose."
3,Stoker?,If you like gore then you will like this book. Moves right along and holds your interest. I didn't find it on the level of a Stoker but it was worth a read.
2,A big disappointment!,"I have read two other books by the author and was really looking forward to this one. I have to say I was very disappointed. The characterization was under developed and I really didn't ""care"" about the characters. They were very one dimensional. The plot was also rather vague and not very interesting. One of the other reviews mentioned this was Little's first book so it was probably just his lack of experience. I loved ""The Store""!!! The subject matter was also rather disturbing to me. I have had three miscarriags in less than two years so I was rather sensitive to the evil little fetuses terrorizing the town. I'm sure he didn't mean to offend anyone. Yes, I will still read Bently Little books but I can't recommend this one. Little is in good company though. As much as I like Stephen King there are a few of his books I thought were boring too."
4,Not bad...but...,"I read most of this book but stopped at the beginning of summertime because I was going on vacation. When I came back, I skipped to the end. I have to say that this isn't really horror but more of a mystery with a jolt. Try it out."
2,"Just disturbing, not entertaining.","If your idea of entertainment is dead babies and mutilatied animals then this book is for you, if that thought disturbs you...RUN! I was alittle bothered by the graphic details of aborted and miscarried fetus that were possed by satan eating off peoples faces. I think that the author needed something absurdly diststeful to take my focus off the slow moving plot (if there was one). The ending left alot to be desired as well, I was not satisfied by this read at all."
1,Sets His Standard...,"Read this book and you have the basic idea of ALL Little books with the exceptions of The Ignored and Dispatch.A fairly normal family somewhere in the Arizona region. Strange events begin. Unbelief! Absurd monster creature enters (zombie-babies in this one, but others include satanic postmen, Jesus-looking vampires, winemaking she-devils, evil store managers, etc). The endings usually include a fist-fight with said demonic monster or comically evil businessman. Don't forget some S&M;."
3,Creepy but disguisting story,"This story is a good example of what you'll find in most of Bentley Little's works. Gore, gore, and some more gore. Some scenes are too disturbing to take with dead babies all throughout the book. I have a stomach for all types of things but find this utterly repuslive and bad taste. I do have the say that he kept the horror strong thoughout the novel though and that is his ultimate intention I'm sure."
1,Boring and Silly,"I threw it down after 100 pages. It is just plain silly and boring. Having recently enjoyed an excellent collection of Bentley Little short stories, I had high hopes for this novel.The only thing remotely interesting in the 100 pages that I endured was the obvious homosexual tension between the main character, Gordon, and his boss as they used the word ""fag"" excessively while seeming to always be on the verge of going bed with each other.If this book is indicative of his other works, Mr. Little needs to stick to short stories and leave novels to the big boys."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I couldn't do it. Normally I'll breeze right through a bentley little book but it took me a week to finish this. If you have never read anything from him you are WAY better off if you start with the store, or the resort."
3,Not one of Bentley Little's better books,"I didn't realize while reading this book that it is Mr. Little's first novel. That explains, I suppose, why this book didn't grab me from the start like his later stuff.This book was ok, but I found myself speed reading through most of it. It just couldn't hold my interest much.I'm surprised it won an award. ""Dispatch"" and ""The Ignored"" are much better and more original. If any Bentley Little books deserve awards, those two do."
4,B Movie Blast,"Little sets most of his stuff in the deserts of Arizona and the location always works well for him. Like Harry Shannon's ""Night of the Beast,"" (set in Nevada) this novel attacks in quick bursts of frenetic energy and gore and turns a small desert town upside down and plays with Biblical themes while it scares you. This one and ""The Summoning"" are my faves from Little. Both are a B Movie Blast from the Past."
3,Horror that requires a slanted view of realism,"This book was the first book I've read of Bently Little (but not the last). I absolutely loved the book until I reached the last quarter of the story. From here things began to really get strange. Events were so unbelievable I just couldn't allow myself to be scared or spooked. I need realistic horror to be truly frightened and this book didn't do it for me. However, his other books ""The Store"" and ""The University"" were very scary due to more realistic events."
3,A Little Stumble,"Little is a lot of fun to read and The Revelation is no different, however its not one of Little's best. The Revelation is unfocused and I thought falling back on ancient Indian spiritual lore was too easy for a writer living in Arizona and not at all worthy of Little's imagination (which is considerable). As with other books, Little writes clean, readable prose, very easy to digest. His writing style combined with rapidly unfolding events combine to make The Revelation a good read but it doesn't compare to other efforts such as The Association or The Store."
2,expensive little rarity,"I can understand why Elizabeth Bishop claimed not to be an artist, so why then, was this published. The visual ability of some writers is well known, but not back then, maybe. Also some artists and poets are prose all the way.This was purchased for a research project. Historical overview mainly."
1,royal pain,"I received this as a gift and thank goodness because I would NEVER purchase it. The music doesn't work correctly and every vibration of the floor causes it to turn on in the middle of the night or when someone walks into the bathroom. My son thinks it's great, but it leaks every time he pees in it. I am constantly cleaning up after him. I have another fisher price potty chair that is also a stool that i used for my daughter and I have no complaints about it. But the Royal Potty is a royal pain!!!"
2,Not the best potty on the market - not even close!,"We got this potty for my daughter a few months ago. I personally thought it would be cute, seeing that she LOVES music. I thought it would be great for her and help with the pricess.The sensor NEVER works! It never plays music when she uses the potty. It does work however in the middle of the night when we are all sleeping. Kind of scary.Also, the plastic is very hard and can be very cold on a litlte ones bottom early in the morning or late in the evening. This making the potty training VERY hard. My daughter never wanted to sit there long enough to go to the bathroom.I wouldn't buy this product if you have a new potty trainee. It's just not worth the money.Buy one that is simple and has some padding to the seat area.GOOD LUCK!"
2,A WASTE OF MONEY!,"I have a little newer version of this potty chair, and I thought it would be great since it has a motion sensor (a light comes on) and plays music when my daughter goes in the potty. However, it is not great. The light sensor comes on at any close movement or heavy steps. And the music goes off just when my daughter sits down, let alone when she actually goes potty in it. This potty is CRAZY! The sensors are WAY too sensitive. And like others have said, children figure out really quick how to make the light come on and make the music play. All they have to do is put their hand down there and the thing goes off. It has driven me crazy enough that I took the batteries out of the potty and am using it as a plain Jane potty. My advice is this. I have seen really cheap potty chairs out there ($10 or so). You might as well go buy a cheap one as to buy this one that is close to $20 that is a piece of junk!"
1,potty is a royal pain,"We recieved this as a gift. My son loved the music, he was more enthralled by throwing toys etc. into it to hear the fanfare than to go potty, I yanked the battery out. The next headache is the fact that the potty handle is guess where? In the front right between the little guy's legs and just so easy to pull out while sitting on the seat part. There is no way I can see to turn the thing around to where he can't pull the potty out while sitting. I tried to contact fisher price but apparently they don't feel the need to follow up with customer complaints. I would advise against this potty, and I would dearly love to give this one back to them, but they WON'T ANSWER my email."
4,Piss Poor Potty!!!,"Just like everyone else says - leaks for boys (horribly), music plays as soon as they sit down, and they want to play with the little red light instead of sitting on it.Abosolutely NOT worth the money.Don't waste your time, money, effort... stop reading... run from this product! Demand your money back!After we get our ""new"" potty in, we'll see if there's any way to remove the pee from the carpet. Do you think we'll have any luck?"
4,Lots of potty fun!,"My 2 year old LOVES his potty chair. He relates the Fisher Price logo to his ""Little People"", and calls it his ""People Potty"". He is just now potty training, but has used the potty periodically over the last 8 months. He just loves the music. It has actually given him some control. He likes to hear it play the music, so he'll go a little, wait for the music, then go some more. It makes him very proud of himself. My 5 year old, who has been potty trained for 3 years, has decided she'd rather use her brother's potty chair, but I won't give in. The only problem I've had with the chair is that the ""shield"" doesn't always seem to work, but that could just be because of the way my son sits on it."
3,This has been a pretty good potty for our daughter,"The reason this potty leaks is because the cup that holds the waste slides in rather than dropping in. This means there is a gap between the rim of the potty seat and the cup, so if a little boy isn't aiming down, the pee is going to go right through it (just like on a regular toilet between the bowl and the seat). Even with a girl though, it does leak if she is sitting too far back on the potty. We have not had any battery life problems or problems with it playing the sound clip when not in use. However, I thought it was a big hinderence at first and took the battery out until our daughter was fully potty trained. Anyhow, we have a tiny bathroom and I am shopping today for a seat that fits directly on the toilet. I think I would opt for a drop in cup style for the next baby."
1,Messy for Boys,I am glad to know it is not just my child! This potty leaks just about everytime he uses it! The battery died very quickly and the sounds were always sporadic at best. I would DEFINITELY discourage anyone from buying this potty. It is hindering the potty training due to the fact that my son get's upset when it leaks all over his leg! I plan on trashing mine and finding a good replacement.
3,"Good design, bad batteries!","We picked this chair mainly b/c it had arms and would better support my young son. The music seemed like an added bonus, but it wasn't. It played the music all the time, not only when he actually used the potty. I would get woken up in the middle of the night by the music b/c my cat had walked in the hallway outside the bathroom and set it off. The batteries ran out fast and I have not replaced them! Besides that, it's been great."
2,Too small for chubby legs!,"This potty chair was a hand-me-down from my neice. The problem is, my 2 year old son's legs are too chubby for it. He's not even overly large. He weighs 29 lbs and is 34"". When the guard is in place for boys, the sides of the chair force his legs towards the center and the guard digs in to the bottom of his thighs. He got up after 2 minutes and had deep, red creases in his legs! I'm sure this isn't an issue for girls no matter how chubby, but for boys, it doesn't work."
1,Great - except it leaks,"I don't know if it's just because I'm training a boy instead of a girl, but every time he uses this potty, it leaks urine all over the floor! Very frustrating. We bought a seat that goes on the big potty and will be putting the Fisher Price potty out for the garbage."
4,Not good for a boy!,As a mom of 3 boys I am now training my twins. Every time they would use this potty it would go through the crack between the bowl and the chair. The splash guard was connected to the chair and not the bowl. It left such a mess on the floor. Terrible! Don't buy this potty. If you have a boy look for one that has an all-in-one splash guard and bowl.
1,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY FOR A BOY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,We bought this potty seat for our 18 month boy and he started using it at 22 months. EVERY TIME HE PEES IT LEAKS ALL OVER THE FLOOR !!! I am going out right now to buy something else. He is very comfortable on it but I can not have him peeing on the floor every time. It leaks out between the seat and the pull out bowl.
2,Guess what? It leaks!,"A friend of mine and I both bought this potty for our kids because we found the design cute and loved the idea of musical ""rewards"" for a job well done. We were far from pleased, however, to discover that it leaks and makes a big mess for parents to clean up! We have since experienced much better luck with a potty seat that fits over the grown-up toilet seat. In addition to its ease of use, kids seem to feel more ""grown up"" using the real potty. Don't waste your money on the ""royal potty""."
2,"Fun potty, but very messy","When we first bought the potty, my 2 year old son loved it! He loved sitting down and hearing the music trumpet when he had success! He also LOVED the book that went with it.The downside to this potty, it is leaks TERRIBLY. Especially with boys, the urine runs down the pee guard and underneath it soaking the underside of the potty.Taking apart the potty is a pain, as you have to take apart the piece that holds the sensor, as the pee gets trapped under this.After a while, we just took off the sensor, and I had to wipe the underside of the potty every time he went.We only use this potty in the car for an emergency."
1,Waste of money!,"Waste of money!!! Every time my son used this potty, I had a big puddle to clean up on the floor and I had to put diaper to prevent this mess."
1,Waste of Money!,This potty is a complete waste of money. It give the child a false sense of accomplishment because the sensors are so sensitive on it it makes noise every time it's bumped. My daughter still will not go potty. She sits on it and barely moves and plays the music. This happens sometimes when we walk past it. I am terribly disappointed. I'd rather give it 0 stars.Do not buy this potty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Not worth the $$$,"I bought this potty for my 18 month old when he started saying ""Potty"" everytime one of us went to the bathroom. First time he sat on it, he caught his little boy parts on the splash guard. I guess it hurt him enough to scare him because he will not sit on it anymore. It was too big for him to sit on by himself, so I would have to lift him onto it to avoid him getting caught on the splash guard. He has learned to pull the guard off now, but still will not sit on it without clothes on. I would not recommend this one at all."
2,LEAKY MESS and WON'T SHUT UP!!!!,"My son always pees over the bowl and urine ends up in the floor. Also, I have to take the batteries out because it wouldn't stop playing"
2,scary potty ... I don't want da da da daaaaa!,"My daughter thought the book was great, but the sounds the potty made and the red sensor light made her uncomfortable. We tried removing the batteries so it did not make any noise and she warmed up to it, but never to the point of actually wanting to use it to potty. In addition, the bowl was too easy for a curious toodler to remove. My daughter always removed the bowl when she sat on the potty."
4,Maybe it's a boy thing,"I purchased this potty for my daughter as an extra or ""downstairs"" potty. Our house has a lot of stairs and moving the potty around became a real pain. This potty was inexpensive so I felt it would be a good extra. We have had no problems with leakage. In fact it has been great. It is incredibly easy to clean. We haven't had a problem with the batteries either. My daughter loves the comfort of the seat and she feels special when she hears the Ta Da music. Maybe the leaking has to do with the differences between the way boys and girls use it. It seemed that most of the negative comments came from the caregivers of boys."
1,Leaky Potty,"This is a horrible potty! I am so disappointed with it. Everytime my son pees on it, it leaks all over the floor. There's a gap between the little bowl and the seat and he seems to pee right where that gap is. He loves to use the potty, but I find myself discouraging him from using it because I'm tired of cleaning up the mess. This is definately one of the worst baby purchases I've made."
3,Get out the paper towels.......,"My three year old son seems very comfortable with this potty, however it does leak for us. Every time he sits on it and urinates there is a puddle on the floor. I have not used the musical aspect of it yet, I thought it would be distracting for him. I liked the look of it because of the back and the handles, but keep a role of paper towels handy because it can leak."
2,Not room to sit correctly on potty,"I had 2 of these potties, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. Before potty training I thought these would be great for the comfort of the seat and the ease of disposal. It turns out that as soon as my daughter was ready to go potty the potty seat was too small and her pee often went right between the seat and the little bowl and wound up on the floor. The pediatrician advised a potty seat that allows for the kids to have their feet steady and their legs spread so they can relax to go potty. Another problem with my daughter not being able to spread her legs is that she couldn't get her hand in to wipe herself. I wound up getting the soft seat potties and those were great. Since then we moved up to a potty seat on the big potty with a step."
2,*nOT VERY HELPFUL,"aLL CHILDREN POTTY TRAIN AT THEIR OWN PACE, BUT MINE LEARNED AS SOON AS i GOT RID OF THIS THING. mY SON LIKED THE LITTLE MUSIC SO MUCH HE VIEWED IT AS A TOY INSTEAD OF A PLACE TO ""DO HIS BUSINESS"". iT'S NOT EASY TO TRAIN A CHILD WITH WITH A MUSICAL TOILET (AS IF POTTY TRAINING WASN'T HARD ENOUGH). hE USED TO PUT HIS HAND IN IT TO HEAR THE MUSIC. wHICH IS WHY i'M GLAD HE NEVER ACTUALLY USED IT."
2,You will be cleaning up a lot...,"As some of the other reviewers have stated, the musical part of this potty is inconsistent. But that's not what bothered me. The pot does not meet the chair part, and every time my boys used it, the pee leaked out through that gap. I ended up throwing this one away & buying another potty by The First Years."
1,Not so good-for a boy,"I have the same complaints as the other reviewers for my son's use of this product. Because of the sides of the chair being tall and close, it's hard for a boy to use. Without the deflector the pee just goes out in front of him because he can't sit with his legs far enough apart, and with the deflector my son won't sit on this potty at all because it hurts his legs and he can't get up by himself without getting his parts caught on it. It leaks urine from between the chair and the removable bowl, and the music only worked for 2 1/2 days. Maybe it would be better for a girl."
2,Okay potty but could be better,"I bought this for my son about 7 months ago and he did like it at first but it should be made a little bigger. It hurts his legs when using the deflector part and you have to use that part with a boy. Maybe this potty is better for a girl but definately not a boy. Also it is hard to clean with too many cracks and sometimes it leaks. The only part me and my son liked was he liked to pull the container out by himself and empty it thats why i gave it the 2 stars i did.I never even used the music part of it so i cannot review that but i think that it is useless.I have decided just to buy a soft kids seat for the big toilet and a step stool. I would not buy this potty again. I would recommend you research other pottys on the market because this is no good.If fisher price improved this potty by making it a little bigger for boys and improved some other things, then it probably would be the best potty."
1,Leaks With Girls Too,"My daughter likes this potty, but I definitely do not. Almost every time she uses it, it leaks. I too thought it was b/c my daughter did not get to the potty in time, but one day I happened to be nearby and saw it spilling over onto the floor. Definitely a defect in design. As for the music as positive reinforcements -- the batteries didn't last long b/c every little movement causes it to go off. I highly recommend people to look into alternative potty chairs."
5,perfect potty,"this is a wonderful product - it not only came with the potty - but books, information packs, a chart and stickers for successful trips to the potty!! Can't wait to get started!! My daughter loves checking out the music when she sits. I think it will really help ease the transition!!"
1,This potty is a mess waiting to happen,"My 2 yr old boy recently started using this potty - he loves it and the sound it makes - but this thing leaks terribly out the front and I end up cleaning up a pee pee mess on the floor and on the potty itself.Do yourself a favor, if you have a boy, do not get this potty."
2,MESSY potty seat . . .,"I was given this potty seat for my daughter (now age 2 1/2). At first glance it seems cute and makes ""reward"" noises and even comes with a story. First, the story was kind of dumb in my opinion and there are much better potty books out there, but that is a side issue. My real pet peeves with this potty are: 1. It leaks big time, and I have a girl so it's not because she sprays like little boys might. About 1/2 the time I had to clean up around the potty after my dd used it, and I had the bowl in correctly! (As if we don't have to clean up enough potty/accidents in potty training!!) 2. The music is supposed to be a reinforcement, but my dd quickly realized that her hand could also activate the sensor, so here she would sit putting her hands down in the potty to make the music play! I took those batteries out real quick . . .Anyhow, we are now using the $1 garage sale potty that I got as an ""extra"" and the royal potty is in the closet!"
1,leeks pee,I got this for my daughter and she likes sitting on it but it leeks pee almost every time she uses it. The clean up is so much work. I wouldn't recommend it even for girls.
4,leak free,"I purchased this training toilet after dealing with the constant leaking of another brand's model. Not only does it not leak, it is incredibly easy to clean after use."
1,Very Poor Design,"As a first time mom, this ""royal throne"" makes potty training a royal frustration! First and Foremost, when my daughter does make it to this potty chair, the chair leaks. So I'm still cleaning up a mess!!! The pot/bowl has too much space between it and the seat, so the urine squirts out and runs down the legs and around the edge of the bowl. We tried the shield, nope! It is very hard plastic that hurts to straddle it. We tried placing a book under the legs to give it a tilt. That didn't work either. So the chair has to be placed on a vinyl floor not on carpet because it tends to leak 4 out of 5 times. Best wishes if you choose to buy it."
1,"Musical potty = all play, no potty!","I have twin girls that are in the early stages of potty training. I thought a musical potty would spark an interest for them in wanting to potty. Boy, was I wrong. All they want to do is play with this potty! They are constantly putting their hands inside the hole to make the music sound. The two I bought are on their way to the garage sale and I am on my way to the store to buy 2 more- non-musical!!"
1,More pee in the floor than in the pot!,I do not recommend that you buy this potty chair. I purchased it and when my son uses it the pee runs in the floor. So I end up with a major mess. I have ordered another potty chair that I should be receiving soon and I will let everyone know how it works.
1,"leaks,leaks,leaks","This potty makes a mess. After my son goes potty there is always a puddle of pee on the floor. We bought two pottys and they both leak. We are returning them. Plus the music only worked for one day. In addition to, this potty's music will not work if your child ""sits"" on the potty for a while. Do not buy this potty."
1,Do not buy!! It leaks!!!!,"I have a boy, and like many of the others who have wrote a review, I am very disappointed in this product. While I'm thrilled when my son tells me he has to go potty, I'm tired of cleaning up the floor after every trip to the ""royal throne"". This product was very poorly designed. Boys somehow shoot through where the top of the pan meets the bottom of the chair. There is no way Fisher Price did any ""trials"" on this product before putting it on the market. And as for the music, the batteries quickly ran out because the thing was playing music all the time, even if no one was in the room."
1,Terrible for a boy,"This potty leaks very badly. Every time my son uses the chair half of his ""deposit"" leaks between the seat and the cup and ends up on the floor. Plus, the tune mechanism does not work well since the ""stream"" never goes directly across the sensor. The only good thing I've found is the handles on the side help him to sit down. However, I would not recommend this chair at all."
1,Battery Eater,This chair looks cute but all it takes is the slightest movement and the music plays it EATS batteries (and i dont mean the cheap ones) the pull out tray seems convenient unless you have a little sports fan like my daughter who thinks the tray looks just like a base ball hat and it as often running around with it on her head as she is trying to potty in it or stick her hands in to hear the music. we have had no success using this chair only distractions.
3,Good for Girls Bad for Boys,"This potty is great for GIRLS. My daughter loved it and clean up was a breeze but when we started to potty train our son,boy were we disapointed. Everytime he went pee it leaked out everywhere. Which in my opinion defeats the purpose of having a potty chair in the first place."
3,Too Small,"I bought this potty chair for my 18 month old son. He is 27 1/2 pounds and 33 inches tall. When I sat him on this chair it was just way too small. There was no breathing room for his bottom. The hole in the seat just didn't fit him correctly and the splash guard barely covered him. After seeing this, I surely wasn't going to try him out on it. We will be returning this seat."
1,Unsatisfactory,"When my husband and I were at the store to purchase our daughters first potty, we chose this model: the base was wider and it seemed more stable. We quickly removed the batteries for this potty, because our daughter was so interested in listening to the chime, she would put any- and everything into the pot. The extremely easy-to-remove potty cup, has become one of our daughter's favorite hats. This ""potty"" now serves as our daughter's reading or TV watching chair. I strongly urge parents not to consider purchasing this product. It was a waste of money and a great source of irritation."
2,"Can be a ""royal"" mess","do not buy this potty chair simply for the ""bells and whistles"" they never seem to work at the right time - or at all half of the time. I would have liked to see it be a little deeper as far as size goes, my boys had a little trouble squeezing in when the protector was on. The main thing that annoys me and maybe this only happens with boys, but it occasionally leaks underneath between the bowl and where it slides in. I am guessing that since the boys urine comes out the front, rather than underneath, it leaks out in that space where the bowl slides out. There are even times that my older son's pants got wet from resting at the front of the potty when he sat. If I had to do it all again, I would opt for using the big potty from the start - cleaning those things out gets old fast too!"
2,Not a great potty,"I bought this for my two year old, what a mistake. The first problem was it leaked. Just as you are watching your child do their business it was leaking all over the floor. The second problem was that this sound stopped after a few uses. I would not recommend this potty."
1,Royal Potty or Plastic Floor Lubrication Device?,"For a long time, I just assumed that my 2 1/2 year old son was ""missing"" every time he peed in this potty, and I ended up mopping up the floor. I simply could not believe that any manufacturer, especially one as reputed as Fisher Price, would design a kiddy potty with such a glaring design flaw. But, in fact, upon more careful inspection, I realized that there is a substantial gap between the potty seat and the receptacle that attaches underneath the seat. Through that gap goes the bulk of the pee. I have managed to fill the gap with a combination of duct tape and tissue paper, but I fear that this makeshift gapfiller will soon become revolting. I am going out this weekend to buy a new potty seat. Save yourselves the trouble and expense."
1,Leaks with daughter every time!,"I could care less about anything else. This potty does the one thing I cannot tolerate- it leaks and I mean has leaked every time she has used it. We had an old wooden and plastic potty that never, ever leaked once. I foolishly threw it away when we brought this one home. Now, I have had it! It even leaks when it looks like it hasn't. Check underneath and there's a puddle. It's cute, I like the overall design and easy detachable bowl, but I would never, ever recommend this potty to anyone under any circumstances and am writing the manufacturer with our woes. Good luck!"
2,dont buy,"this was the 3rd potty i bought my son who is 18 months.the first one was 3 in 1 step potty from safety first.i though it was ok but my son didnt like it,so i went and bout the musical flushing potty, the lid snapped shut my son could not open it by himself,it was hard to take out the pee bucket and the flushin handel was to hard for him to push down it wasnt nice and soft. this royal thing [stinks].the light stays on 24/7 which causes it use allot of batteries.the pee bucket wont stay secure in place and it leaks.there is no seal.im on my 4 and already dont like it.im gonna try the baby bjorn,but ive heard it is only for tiny kids.well see.saveur money dont buy this one"
4,Works Beautifully!,"I fortunately haven't had the problems many have had with this potty.My son started playing with it at around a year old. He learned if he stepped it in it the music played. He just turned two a couple weeks ago and this past week decided to start potty training. He immediately took to the potty chair and is doing great.He can get on and off easily on his own.The splash guard works perfectly.He can remove the basin on his own, although he does occassionally spill a little, but he's just two and would spill anything he's holding with liquid in it.It is very easy to clean out.The only complaint I have is that the music does not sound when he goes. It works fine if you put a toy in it or your foot (as he proved at a younger age), but not when he potties. But, it doesn't really matter. I don't think he'd be any more proud of himself if he received a fanfare.Overall, I think this potty is terrific and would recommend it to anyone."
2,A Royal Pain,"I purchased this potty for my son. I thought that the ""royal"" turns would give him an interest in using it, it didn't. He used it once and cried! He would not sit on it again. I was very disappointed. The potty would sing for now reason sometimes and EVERY TIME you would touch it. I do not recommend."
1,Don't Buy It,"I usually read reviews before I buy big ticket items, but rarely for less expensive items. Sure wish I would have read the reviews before buying this potty chair. It has been the worst purchase I have ever made! My son doesn't complain about the fit, but I definitly complain about having to clean up the floor everytime he uses it. He uses a step stool and the big potty at the sitters, which is what I am going to have him do at home, as I am sick of the mess. I took the batteries out of the potty shortly after buying it as I found it real irritating and never working right. I have bought Fisher - Price items for my children for over 25 years, but they really disappointed me on this item. I will be writing them a letter to let them know how I feel. Maybe the item has been updated since I bought mine (I'm not sure,) but I wouldn't buy it because of my experience with this one. Don't waste your money!"
2,Wouldn't recommend this for a boy! Leaks!,"I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one that's had this problem with this potty! We bought this over a year ago for our son to try to potty train him before he was 2. He was absolutely amazed at the music when he went (even though it didn't always go when it was supposed to and sometimes went when it shouldn't) and always wanted to ""go potty."" Unfortunately, he eventually tired of it and was no longer ""thrilled"" at the music. My biggest complaint, however, is that it leaks! What good is a potty chair that won't hold the contents?!?!? Somewhere between the guard and the bowl itself there's obviously not a tight enough fit. I would've thought they would've tested this kind of thing before it was ever put on the market! Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Not for chubby legged toddlers,"My son is big for 2 years old. He still has his chubby baby legs. The opening was way too small for him. Plus we couldn't even put the ""boy"" guard on because it would pinch his thighs. The reward sound would go off all the time even if he wasn't going."
2,"Leaks, Leaks, Leaks...","My 20 month old daughter loves this potty. She has been going on it since she was 9 months old. 3 Complaints about it though..(1) it doesnt seem very comfortable,(2) The music is annoying and distracts my daughter when she is trying to pee, (so i remved the batteries)(3) This is the worst one. It leaks like crazy. I made it my mission to find out why. It has nothing to do with the bowl being placed in correctly. It has to do with the tiny gap between the bottom of the hole in the seat and the actual bowl. The pee runs down my daughters leg/butt towards the back or side and runs under the seat and in between the seat and bowl so it leaks out. So for all you people with leaks this is the reason as i spent so much time figuering out the problem."
3,So Far So Good!!!,"We bought this for our daughter at 18mo, I put it in the bathroom thinking she would get the idea being in there but wouldn't have anything to do with it. So I took it to the family room so she could play with it and sit on it while watching Barney. She is now 21mo and took off her diaper and sat on her potty chair...No Leaks here...maybe it's not for boys. No red marks or scratches here either. The music we can do without. I do wish the pot had a lock where little ones couldn't just pull it out...she wants to empty her own potty!!!I am sure there may be better ones out there and worse ones as far as that goes."
2,Very Poor Product-Great Customer Service,I really disliked this product. It leaked out between the potty and the bowl. It is also very difficult to clean. I noticed an odor from it one day so I started looking and found a lot of crevices that are impossible to get clean. I called Fisher-Price and they were very nice and sent me coupons for the amount I paid for it. I replaced it with an inexpensive potty without the musical feature.
3,cute but not for boys,"My son thinks the music is great and loves to use the potty but, the first thing he does when he sits down is to remove the shield, and then he takes the potty out. Needless to say when he starts using it, I am racing to put the pieces back before the floor is totally wet. Also, the shield seems to be sqeezing his legs. Perhaps that is part of the reason he tries to take it off. Further as others have stated, it does play music for no reason, and I was amazed today when the potty was full and I never heard a thing. When I bought my potty I bought one for my freind, and she has all the same issues with her son."
2,"cute,but annoying","Seemed like a good motivator at the time we bought it. However, after the first couple of days, the batteries were removed. Every time you bump it, the music goes off. It's too cute, my 3 year old daughter thinks it's more of a toy than a functioning potty. She has yet to actually do anything on it. It gets more use as a chair or a pretend potty for her bear/doll menagerie. I also wish it had a lid on it. It sits between the toilet and the sink (the only place in our small bathroom that we can put it), and we're always knocking things off the sink into it, or kicking it (which is why we took the batteries out). There are more sensible options out there."
3,Its okay.. works better on toilet.,First of all it takes up alot of battery it does play music at the wrong time. It sometime leaks. but i still like it. my 20 mths old son rather have it on the toilet so it works out better. It works better on the toilet because its stays in place unlike other potty chairs that moves around on top. i would reccomend it for kids that like to go potty on the toilet.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This is the absolute worse potty seat I have purchased. I thought the music reinforcement would be encouraging to my son--however, the ""sensors"" are oversensative to say the least. If you just walk by the potty it begins playing. It is very annoying. Also it leaks. There is no seal between the seat and the bucket and I have had to mop my floor up several times. I hate this potty seat and have already purchased another with less bells and whistles. Actually praise and small reinforcers like stickers will go a lot further than the silly song played by this ""royal throne""."
2,Why'd I even bother?,"As others have stated, this potty leaks. I have girls who have used it, and not realized it had leaked... until the smell... YUCK. Never put batteries in it so I can't comment there. The girls did love the book, but it was ruined in no time. Maybe a vinyl book would've been better."
4,Loads of fun!!,My toddler has enjoyed using this potty so much. The little book it comes with is particularly helpful in showing her what to do. The splash guard also is a great feature. I am very pleased with this purchase.
1,Worst potty for boys,"My husband and I were having trouble getting our 2 year old interested in using the potty, so we bought this one because its suppose to play music. Well, it does sometimes, but most of the time it doesn't work and our son is tall for his age so he has problems sitting down without hurting himself on the splashguard. The worst thing about this potty is that it leaks !! alot !!! and my son ends up with a huge puddle on the floor under his seat or worse, down his legs and all over his clothing. He feels bad about it and its not his fault...the bowl does not fit tightly on the chair and even when he holds his penis down...it still leaks out the sides of the bowl and all over the floor....its a real mess. We are giving up on this chair and going with one that fits onto a regular toilet.best of luck with your choice!!!"
1,don't buy this one,"My son is tall and the guard is not tall enough. And when ""it"" makes behind the guard, it leaks out!! He was freaked out by the red light (sensor) so we could not use it with batteries. BIG WASTE OF $$$"
1,Not a good choice for a boy,"My sister-in-law loved this potty for her daughter so I bought it for my son. It is not a good potty for boys! While my son loves to sit on it and read (it seems to be comfortable), and the splash guard works well, he pees though to space between the seat and cup every time. His clothes and my floor get soaked. Also, the music sensor doesn't work well for boys because they pee down the splash guard instead of straight into the potty. I'm getting rid of this potty."
4,The royal potty,"***************NOT FOR BOYS******************Unless you want to keep cleaning your floor. The problem is there is no seal between the seat and the pull out tray that catched the ""mess"". If your son points down, its all over your floor. If he sits long enough it will be all over his pants that are probably touching the floor. Do not buy it for a boy. Lol...other then that it's probably a great potty for girls."
2,Leaky Potty!,"This potty is a great idea but it LEAKS! When I bought it someone told me they had trouble with it and I thought I would try it out anyway - it leaks. I have made sure the cup is properly in place but it doesn't matter, it still leaks."
1,BAD PRODUCT!!!!!!!,"I HAPPILY BOUGHT THIS CHAIR FOR MY 18 MONTH OLD SON AND WAS SOON DISAPPOINTED AT ITS PERFORMANCE. FIRST OF ALL,THE MUSIC IS A DISTRACTION AND HE HAS SOON LEARNED THAT ANY SLIGHT MOVEMENT CAN CAUSE THE MUSIC TO ACTIVATE. THIS IN ITSELF HINDERS THE PROCESS OF TOILET TRAINING. IT ALSO LEAKS AND THE SEAT IS HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE. EVEN WHEN HE DID GO POTTY, HE WAS NOT REWARDED WITH MUSIC OVER HALF OF THE TIME. FINALLY THE FACT THAT THE BOWL CAN BE PULLED OUT FROM THE FRONT IS A TERRIBLE DESIGN IDEA AND CAN EASILY BE REMOVED BY MY CHILD. THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE!!!!!"
1,Such a distraction!!!!,This potty is cute don't get me wrong but the Music feature is too much of a distraction for first time potty users. My daughter quickly found the light sensor to make the potty play music and that was it for trying to go potty. It was more like a toy to play with for her than to actually sit and use the potty. I wouldn't recommend it at all
2,too much music!!,"It is supposed to reward with music but for the new at potty training every time you fidget just a little the music starts and by the time it finishes it only starts again, by the time something does happen the child is tired on the music and does not realize its a reward!! Also sudden loud sounds set it off, like the toilet seat falling. I was not impressed at all."
2,"No, No, No!","I was immediately sold, when I was told of the features of this potty. The potty detector and the music it plays were the things that got me. However, just as the other moms have stated, this ""Royal Potty"" has its issues. The potty sensor is super-sensitive and comes on even if someone just walks by it, the music plays when no one is in the bathroom, which is pretty creepy, and on top of all that, the hole is too small for BM's, so it ends up everywhere except in the pot. NOT A GOOD THING!!"
1,Worked great...at first!!!,"I bought this potty about six months ago thinking this would get my little boy interested. It worked well for about a week. My son wasn't interested in it unless it made noise before he sat on it, so he would wave his hand in it and then sit on it do his buissness (sometimes). Anyways, after a week it stopped making the little music sounds no matter what you did. I cleaned it after every use and even changed the batteries. Then every time my son peed in it it leaked out all over the floor. It seems as though if you pull out the little cup too much, it doesn't slide back in the right way anymore. So, this is not a good toilet trainer, I ended up buying an 8 buck seat you put on your toilet and he likes to use that one more because it's the ""big potty""!"
2,He might as well just pee on the floor!,"At first, I thought this potty was a God-send. It was stable so my above average 2 year wasn't able to flip it over as easily as some of the others we tried. It is generally pretty easy to clean up too. HOWEVER, as other reviewers have noted, this potty LEAKS UNBELIEVABLY! Every time he went, it would just shoot out the gaps between the chair and the removable seat. At first I thought it wasn't together right, but indeed it was! He's finally begun using it regularly, so I've had newspaper under him and the Resolve carpet cleaner ready. Talk about inconvenient. I just went out and bought another one thinking this was defective. Same thing happend. They're both going back and I found one that doesn't leak. Maybe it's better for girls. Less of an angle! If you have a boy, don't go with this model or buy stock in Resolve. :)"
1,Waste of $$$,"I bought this for my son, although he likes to use the ""baby"" potty, I wish I never bought it. I guess my som likes it because it's his size, but the batteries run out quickly, the music plays whenever something goes by it, and it LEAKS!!!! I am very UNHAPPY with this product!!!"
